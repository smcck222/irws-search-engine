<F P=106> [Article by Nihad al-Ghadiri] </F>
  [Text] An old Arab friend of mine with a great history 
wrote to me a long letter dripping with blood and tears, asking: 
Did you forget Iraq? I was surprised by the question for two 
reasons: First because we did not forget Iraq and are actually 
sharing its sufferings, and, second, because the question 
resounds with bitter rebuke of a true friend. When we are 
overwhelmed by fast developing events around us and are forced 
to deal with them, we actually do commit the crime of remaining 
silent and of forgetting Iraq. 
  The question here is not one of supporting Iraq for Iraq's 
sake only, although such a stand is rightful and honorable. The 
question is that with our momentary and unintended silence we 
would unwittingly be participating in the big conspiracy which 
we are witnessing taking place on the world stage, and which 
threatens us all, with no difference between one Arab and 
another and one country and another. Everybody is targeted and 
everybody is planning to crush it. Iraq is just one example of 
the fate awaiting the others--all the others. Therefore 
forgetting Iraq and keeping silence over what is being done to 
it--the continuing unjust siege, the suffering of its patient 
people, the enduring of force and injustice, all with the 
blessing of the Arabs of thirst and drought--is tantamount to 
keeping silence over what is awaiting all of us tomorrow and 
what is going to befall us at the hands of the cruel 
international legality which is singling out the Arab countries 
one by one. Although the methods differ, the objective is one. 
  Three years have passed since that cursed war whose aim we 
were told was to regain Kuwait. They have regained "their 
Kuwait" and the matter is over. Why is the siege continuing and 
how can they justify the hardships they are inflicting on the 
Iraqi people? 
  Had they recaptured Kuwait and gone, leaving Iraq alone, we 
would have believed them, or at least some of us would have 
believed that Kuwait was the reason and the objective. But the 
fact that the sanctions are continuing after three years 
uncovers the contemporary pirates' real objective of the war and 
the siege: The target is Iraq's strength, independence, and its 
people's dignity. It is also the victory it achieved in the 
first Gulf [Iraq-Iran] war, the war that has saved them all. 
They want to prevent Iraq from physically embodying this 
victory, which is its right and its historical right to do. Iraq 
is targeted whether because of Kuwait or otherwise. If Kuwait's 
story did not exist they would have found another excuse and 
another justification for their war. 
  The question of the continuing siege of Iraq that is 
continuing up to this day has two aspects: 
  The aspect of the Western stand, which is understood within 
the framework of Western imperialist policy and its attempt to 
dominate the area, plunder its wealth, and maintain its 
supremacy at the expense of others. 
  And the aspect of the incomprehensible Arab stand which, in 
a 
moment of incredible impotency and cowardice, abandoned all the 
Arab values, history, kinsfolk, language, beliefs and dreams, 
and threw itself at the first Western feet to set on the 
area--licking its boots, prostrating itself, begging, asking 
forgiveness, seeking self-protection, thinking that foot that is 
stepping on it today will spare its being crushed underfoot 
tomorrow. 
  Now that we have spoken a lot, written a lot, and suffered a 
great deal more we would ask the ordinary Arab citizen and the 
patriotic nationalist elite, or what we think is the patriotic 
nationalist elite, is it not time for them to move, to organize, 
to set up organizations to fill the Arab arena, to shout at the 
top of their voices, to ask their rulers and colonizers, to tell 
them: You cowards, did you not have enough of Iraq, of its 
children's blood, of its hunger and deprivation? 
  What stops any Arab country from breaking the siege and 
defying the illegitimate legality [as published] and injustice 
that should arouse deep anger among Arabs? Or, has the arena 
become vacant of men and the Arabs lost their senses, so the men 
are neither men nor are they Arab. 
  What stops any community in every country neighboring Iraq 
from defying the siege by breaking it and carrying on its back 
flour, medicine, food, and baby's milk, and shout in the face of 
the United Nations and its Butrus Ghali: You all go to hell! I 
could almost shout: When Iraq starves and we are only onlookers, 
let us too go to hell. 
  May our right arm forget us if we forget thee Iraq!

  [Text] The public has learned about the primary features of 
the budget that will be debated by the parliamentary committee 
for financial affairs before it is discussed at the Parliament's 
general meetings. 
  Although this budget stems from the "philosophy" of the 
so-called government program on the basis of which the 
parliamentary majority gave its vote for the present government, 
the finance law is unable to deliver what the said program urges 
with regard to encouraging investment and creating a suitable 
atmosphere for it. 
  It is known that the first condition for investment is the 
availability of clear and precise resources in the proposed 
state budget. But it is observed that the proposed investment 
budget represents only seven percent of the GDP. This is a poor 
average compared with that of the budgets of the early eighties, 
which reached 15 percent. 
  Even this poor average remains vulnerable, because it is 
basically linked to Morocco's obtaining foreign loans that the 
government expects to reach $2 billion in 1994. 
  In addition to the fact that this will increase Morocco's 
foreign debts, it is not certain that these amounts can be 
obtained. This means that the investment budget will continue to 
be dependent on these foreign finances, which remain mere 
possibilities. 
  Therefore, it can be said that the field of public 
investment 
will not develop; rather it will continue to follow the same 
direction that the successive previous governments followed 
since the policy of structural reform began. This policy has led 
to a crisis, which is reflected in particular on the fields of 
employment and the citizens' social conditions. 
  With regard to employment, this year's budget promises to 
create 25,000 jobs, an increase of 10,000 jobs compared with 
1993. But official data tell us that tens of thousands of 
graduates will enter the job market every year, some of whom 
have been unemployed for more than 10 years. The budget 
submitted this year will not be able to absorb the hundreds of 
thousands of unemployed blue-and white-collar workers. 
  Also, establishing a special fund for the employment of 
youngsters with a capital of 100 billion centimes creates the 
problem of how can this amount can be utilized in order to get 
maximum benefit from it and to solve part of the problem of the 
unemployed youths with professional, scientific, and 
intellectual capabilities. 
  On the one hand there is the problem of structuring the 
loans 
and the rate of interest on them and the guarantees that are 
difficult to obtain. On the other, the general climate is not 
helpful for the establishment of small- and medium- sized 
contracting companies. The difficulties include administrative 
obstacles and the lack of infrastructure, equipment, and land. 
  Therefore, the problem of unemployment remains an urgent 
matter in the field of Moroccan economy. It is not enough for 
the budget to come up with promises about job creation and the 
establishment of a fund in order to overcome chronic, structural 
problems. 
  The weakness of the social aspect is also reflected in the 
1994 budget, both on the level of wages and of reforming of a 
number of sectors, the most important of which, for example, is 
the housing sector. 
  The [finance] minister's statement contains quick references 
to this sector, which should be dealt with in a manner 
categorically different from the past. The housing sector cannot 
remain a source of quick and exorbitant profits or be subject to 
speculation and monopoly as is the case now. It appears that 
this year's budget is no different from the previous ones in 
dealing with such urgent social issues. This is because it is a 
budget stemming from a government program embodying the 
perpetual pattern the Moroccan governments have been following 
for the past 10 years. This is due to pledging financial 
commitments with a narrow scope which adversely affect social 
conditions and public investment. 
  Perhaps the citizens now wonder: What is the strategy on 
which this budget is based? It is known that the present 
government has no economic policy now that the years of a 
planned economy are over. 
  Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the budget is not based 
on any economic precedent. Although it is not based on a planned 
and publicly open economic policy, it is based on the state's 
principal constants that have dealt with the economic and 
financial situation from a class viewpoint which led to 
enriching the rich and impoverishing the middle class and the 
poor. The [government's] answer to these social problems is to 
ignore them sometimes, to remain silent about them other times, 
and yet other times, resort to bludgeoning.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta (KOMPAS)--The leadership structure of 
the Central Executive Council (DPP) of the Indonesian Democratic 
Party [PDI] was finally formed Thursday night, 23 December, 
after a difficult and tiring process. Alex Lithay was elected 
PDI DPP secretary general to assist Megawati Sukarnoputri, who 
Wednesday night had been confirmed as general director of the 
PDI DPP. Mega [Megawati Sukarnoputri] formed a group that she 
called a renewal, in which most of the faces are new and in 
which the individuals reportedly have no conflicts. 
  In the end, Megawati Sukarnoputri's expectation that the 
formation of PDI DPP leadership would not be easy became a 
reality. The nominating team, which she led directly, worked 
with difficulty Thursday because of the tug of war between 
Mega's faction and a "potential" group that turned out to have a 
candidate. In addition, the nominating team also had to face 
external groups with aspirations who wanted their candidates 
accommodated in the PDI DPP structure. 
  As a result, the formation of DPP leadership, which was 
scheduled for completion by 1000 hours, was again delayed, thus 
producing an atmosphere of near hopelessness among MUNAS 
[National Conference] participants, who waited without any 
clarification at Hotel Garden, South Jakarta. [passage omitted] 
  Mega said she hoped the DPP leadership structure would be 
warmly received, with a view to PDI's future "after our long 
journey, which has been full of pain and apprehension." 
<H5>  Tiring Discussions </H5>
  Although she said the day had been full of struggle and 
apprehension, Megawati was ready with lengthy "lobbying" that 
was tiring and sapped one's strength. The daughter of the late 
President Sukarno met yesterday, Thursday, with eight other 
nominating team members at Hotel Atlet Century Park to form the 
PDI DPP. 
  Meanwhile, the other participants waited at the conference 
site at Hotel Garden. They apparently did not guess that the 
nomination meeting would be difficult, and fatigue was visible 
among all the participants. 
  Becoming impatient, DPD [regional executive council] 
delegates held a meeting at 1415 hours in room 403 of Hotel 
Garden. Their discussion included the possible position of all 
the DPD's if the MUNAS should fail or if the nominating team 
working at Century Park Hotel should be unable to finish its 
task on the designated day. 
  The delegates told reporters that the DPD's agreed to ask 
the 
nominating team to report the results of their work and gave 
them a deadline of 1700 hours. If the nominating team did not 
report on the results of their work by that hour, the MUNAS 
would take further action. 
  "We would decide whether the nominating team should be given 
time to complete its task this week, or what, because we are the 
ones who gave the team its mandate," said a delegate. 
  In the end, however, the nominating team was able to 
complete 
its task before 1700 hours. According to a KOMPAS source, an 
official was present while the team discussed the PDI DPP 
structure. The meeting lasted until about 1500 hours. 
  According to the source, the difficulty in the team's 
discussion lay in the designation of a PDI DPP secretary 
general. Reportedly, most of the team members, and particularly 
the chairperson, wanted Wiyanjono as secretary general. 
  Agreement on that was not easy, however, because some wanted 
Ismunandar to be secretary general. The problem became even more 
complex because of demands of team members from a "potential" 
element, which wanted Edwin Sukowati to be included in DPP 
leadership. The meeting then arrived at an impasse. 
  The source said that Megawati nominated Wiyanjono because 
she 
wanted the general director and the secretary general to be able 
to work well together. "If the PDI really wants unity and 
integrity, I want a secretary general who can cooperate," the 
source quoted Mega as saying. 
  With regard to her objection to the candidate nominated by 
the "potential" element, Mega reportedly cited a similar reason. 
She asked that for the sake of unity and integrity the people 
involved not press their wishes too far. Because none of the 
parties was willing to withdraw its nomination, Alex Lithay was 
brought up as an alternative. In the end, his name was approved 
by the nominating team. 
  Alex Lithay was born in Ambon on 1 October 1948 and is a DPR 
[Parliament] member elected through nomination by Maluku 
Province. According to sources close to Mega, she selected Alex 
because Mega has always received much support from branches in 
Eastern Indonesia. "Thus, it was a must for a person from 
Eastern Indonesia to sit in DPP leadership," the source said. 
<H5>  Edwin Renominated </H5>
  After the DPP was formed, Megawati, Antoni Rahael, and 
Slamet 
Mulyadi met with Director General for Sociopolitical Affairs 
Sutoyo N.K. for about 15 minutes and then returned to Hotel 
Garden at about 1700 hours. Upon her arrival at Hotel Garden, 
Mega was guarded closely by security guards and was guided 
directly to room 417, where she was to rest. 
  It turned out that the work of the nominating team was still 
not final, however, because lobbying went on in Megawati's room 
and almost undid the results that had been achieved. The 
Megawati faction had to accommodate a request from the 
"potential" group, which was again determined to put Edwin 
Sunawar Sukowati in DPP management. 
  This happened despite the fact that Mega had rejected the 
presence of Edwin in DPP ranks because the DPP in the future 
would help her to run the organization's activities. Megawati's 
position in rejecting Edwin was so firm that she had threatened 
in the meeting that "either I or he (Edwin) will withdraw." It 
was because of this rejection that the name of Edwin H. Sukowati 
was deleted from the document containing the PDI DPP leadership 
structure for 1993-1998. 
  It was this failure to include Edwin that prompted Alex to 
gather the DPD's at about 1950 hours to lobby them again, with 
the result that, in the end, Megawati consented to accept Edwin 
as a DPP deputy treasurer. According to the source, she accepted 
him because the "potential" group threatened to form a shadow 
DPP in opposition if Edwin was not put in the PDI DPP structure. 
<H5>  Composition of DPP </H5>
  The structure of PDI DPP leadership for the period 1993-1998 
with, as expected, Megawati Sukarnoputri as general director 
tries to picture oneness and integrity in the PDI organization 
by including various factions that have always been sources of 
conflict. The 14 directors are Soetardjo Soerjoguritno, 
Ismunandar, Fitmah Achmad, Kwik Kian Gie, Gerri Mbatemooy, 
Panangian Siregar, Subagyo, K.H. Kholiq, Slamet Mulyadi, Yahya 
Theo, Abdulgani, I Gusti Ngurah Sara, Mangara Siahaan, and 
Suparlan. Secretary General Alexander Lithay has as deputies 
Syafei Ali Gumay, Andi Chaerul M.M., Haryanto Taslam, Mrs. Ratna 
Purnami, Edi Junaedy, and Titik Juliasih. Treasurer Laksamana 
Sukardi has as deputies Mulyono Soetarmo, Untung Sutomo, Neneng 
A.D. Asmasoebrata, Novianti Nasution, F.X. Urip Sujud, and Edwin 
H. Sukowati. 
  The emergence of Alexander Lithay as secretary eneral 
surprised some of the delegates, because the director of the 
Central Executive Council of the Indonesian Christian Youth 
Movement (GAMKI) had never previously been mentioned as a 
candidate for secretary eneral. It is conjectured that his name 
emerged because no common ground was found among the nominating 
team members to select any of the four people nominated for 
secretary general: Ismunandar, J.B. Wiyanjono, Supardan, and 
Sudaryanto. 
  Although he had been a member of the Indonesian Christian 
College Student Movement (GMKI), Lithay can be called a "new 
person" in PDI DPP leadership. Although he has not personally 
worked with Megawati, he said that as director/coordinator of 
the PDI's Banteng [the wild ox, symbol of the PDI] Campus 
Campaign Team at Salatiga, Central Java, (1987) he had 
opportunity for "interaction" with Mega when she was on the 
F-PDI [PDI Faction] Assistance Team of the MPR [People's 
Consultative Council] Working Committee (1993) [year as 
published]. 
  As a "new person," Lithay immediately received messages in 
room 206 from his seniors in the PDI, who included DPR F-PDI 
member Sukowaluyo, who even had a personal talk with Lithay in 
Lithay's room. 
  When asked for his comments on Megawati, Lithay said, "She 
is 
a determined person. The PDI needs someone like her, and she is 
the most suitable person at this time. When a reporter asked 
what steps he and Mega will take to respond to future challenges 
to the PDI, including the never-ending conflicts and the 
"fusion" issues, Lithay was not yet able to make much comment. 
"I think that is a job for the team. We will deal with those 
things together with other DPP members," he asserted. "What 
about internal and external pressures on the PDI?" the press 
asked. "I have no comment on that," Lithay answered. 
<H5>  Speaking Without Notes </H5>
  At exactly 2255 hours, Megawati Sukarnoputri left room 417 
closely guarded and in the company of Ismunandar and Soetardjo 
Soerjoguritno and proceeded to the meeting hall. Meeting 
chairman Alex Asmasoebrata then opened the session. 
  MUNAS participants immediately applauded as each name was 
pronounced by Megawati as director of the PDI DPP. When Mega 
mentioned the names of Neneng Amalia D. Asmasoebrata and Edwin 
H. Sukowati as deputy treasurers, however, many participants 
immediately shouted, "Boo!" 
  After the installation and confirmation of the new PDI DPP 
directors for the 1993-1998 term, which was led by meeting 
chairman Alex Asmasoebrata, Megawati made her first speech to 
her organization and in the presence of Department of Home 
Affairs Secretary General Suryatna Subrata, who was present also 
to close the MUNAS. 
  "The result is that the PDI will be able to do good work for 
all its members, following its long journey from the congress in 
Medan, the special congress in Surabaya, and this MUNAS in 
Jakarta," Mega said. 
  Therefore, she said, let us welcome PDI's future. "Each day, 
we have experienced extraordinary spiritual and physical 
struggles. If PDI members cannot practice internal unity, our 
desire to advance the PDI will not be achieved. Therefore, we 
must all be united," she added. 
  "Forget the past, and look to the future with a sense of 
unity. Practice that, and encourage each other. Let us together 
achieve unity and integrity for the sake of the image of the PDI 
and our beloved nation and republic," she urged. 
  Mega did not forget to salute and sincerely thank the press. 
"The press has disclosed the dynamics of the PDI as they are. 
For that, I say many, many thanks," Mega said at the end of the 
speech, her first. 
<H5>  Policy Statement </H5>
  Meanwhile, spokesman Antoni Rahael issued a PDI policy 
statement, which expressed determination to improve the general 
welfare and national capabilities. The PDI also rejected isms 
such as "marhaenism," Marxism, and Leninism, because the PDI 
reached a consensus that Pancasila [ideology of the Indonesian 
state] is its only basis. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jakarta (KOMPAS)--Harmoko, general chairman of the 
GOLKAR [Functional Group] DPP [Central Executive Council] said 
that each sociopolitical organization is entitled to be a 
"single majority." GOLKAR's present position as single majority 
was decided by voters who channeled their political rights 
through GOLKAR. It is not true that its position could plunge 
Indonesia into a culture of "dictatorship of the majority and 
tyranny of the minority." 
  "There is no need to worry about a single majority. The 
people elected GOLKAR because they accepted GOLKAR's program," 
Harmoko told reporters who stopped him at the Department of 
Information on Tuesday [11 January]. 
  According to Harmoko, each sociopolitical organization must 
fight in the general elections to win a majority. "That is true 
everywhere in the world. Although there may be only two or three 
sociopolitical organizations, there is certain to be a battle to 
win a majority. GOLKAR fully realizes that its position as 
single majority is the will of the voting public. 
  Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, former GOLKAR DPP secretary general, 
expressed a similar view when asked for comment. "What is 
expected? A single majority is the result of general elections. 
Show me a country anywhere that does not have a single 
majority," Sarwono said following a national PROKASIH [Clean 
River Program] working meeting at the Department of Home 
Affairs. "It is more unlikely that election results would be 
divided among sociopolitical organizations to give the 
appearance of democracy." 
  When asked about the statement of Megawati Sukarnoputri, 
general chairperson of the PDI [Indonesian Democratic Party] 
DPP, who said she worried that the ideas and zeal of the single 
majority could plunge Indonesia into a culture of dictatorship 
of the majority and tyranny of the minority, Harmoko stated 
there is no need for such worry. 
  "GOLKAR continues to promote deliberation to achieve 
consensus, in legislatures as well as in other institutions. 
GOLKAR continues to promote Pancasila [ideology of the 
Indonesian state] democracy," Harmoko said. As for Sarwono, he 
replied concisely, "I do not understand why Ms. Mega said that." 
<H5>  Please Do So </H5>
  Harmoko acknowledged that the tour he made of the provinces 
after being elected GOLKAR DPP general chairman was an effort to 
maintain GOLKAR's position as single majority. However, he 
rejected the statement that GOLKAR's present majority position 
is only quantitative and not yet qualitative. "What GOLKAR has 
been fighting for qualitatively and quantitatively is in 
accordance with applicable laws. We have never done anything in 
the elections that is not `sympathetic,'" Harmoko said. 
  In her speech on the 21st anniversary of the PDI, Megawati 
had also called for reconsideration of whether the term `single 
majority' is consistent with the 1945 Constitution. When the 
statement was passed on to Harmoko, the GOLKAR DPP general 
chairman replied, "How can the will of the people be 
misinterpreted as inconsistent with the 1945 Constitution? That 
is not true. How can it be contrary to the 1945 Constitution for 
the political rights of the people to be channeled through one 
party? That is not true. What are the arguments?" 
  "If another sociopolitical organization wants to be the 
`single majority,' please let them do so. It is natural that 
each sociopolitical organization would want to do that. If the 
people then elect GOLKAR, it cannot be stopped," he said. The 
GOLKAR general chairman denied that GOLKAR's victory in the 
general elections was because of support by GOLKAR external 
elements, including the "superstructure." 
<H5>  Not Contradictory </H5>
  Meanwhile, Dr. Albert Hasibuan, S.H. [Master of Laws], and 
Martin Hutabarat, who were contacted separated, said that the 
existence of a single majority will not lead to a political 
culture of "dictatorship of the majority and tyranny of the 
minority" that would be contradictory to the spirit of 
deliberation and consensus. Such a spirit of deliberation and 
consensus is very dependent on the spirit of state 
administrators and leaders of sociopolitical organizations and 
not on the existence of a single majority. 
  "The desire of a party to get the most votes is natural. 
Just 
think of the alternative: If a party does not want to be a 
`single majority,' it must hold back lest it get the most votes. 
Would that not make it difficult for the party itself?" asked 
Albert Hasibuan, who is general chairman of the LPPH (Institute 
for the Publicizing and Study of Law). 
  Therefore, said Hasibuan, it is the right of every 
organization participating in general elections to win a single 
majority by democratic means. 
  Hasibuan surmised that the recent emergence of discussion 
was 
prompted by suspicion that a single majority will create a 
monopoly in decisionmaking. Under Pancasila democracy, however, 
a decision does not depend on the existence of a single majority 
but on the rightness of the issue for which a decision must be 
made. 
  According to Hasibuan, it would be better if statements on 
single majority were put in the context of dialectic dynamics, 
so that everyone would try to move the next general elections 
toward being more democratic. The important things are that 
democracy be adhered to and that votes are not "engineered." 
<H5>  Strengthening of Legal Institutions </H5>
  Like Hasibuan, Martin Hutabarat believes that the principles 
of deliberation and consensus and of single majority are two 
different things. Deliberation and consensus is a decisionmaking 
method, while single majority is the goal of an election 
participant organization for the sake of ensuring the stability 
of development. 
  Hutabarat said that a single majority does not automatically 
lead to "dictatorship of the majority and tyranny of the 
minority," which would ultimately neglect the deliberation and 
consensus principle. "That depends on the spirit of state 
administrators. Do they want to maintain a spirit of family and 
of deliberation and consensus, or not?" Hutabarat asked. 
  Nevertheless, Hutabarat said, it is not enough to depend on 
the spirit of state administrators. Therefore, the support of 
other elements is needed if the spirit of state administrators 
is to be maintained. This includes, for example, openness of the 
press, which has been actively promoting issues of openness and 
transparency. 
  According to Hutabarat, another element is the strengthening 
of legal institutions, such as state administrative 
jurisprudence and the National Commission on Basic Human Rights. 
"For example, if a person is dismissed from his job because he 
joined the PDI, he can now appeal that decision to the PTUN 
[State Administrative Court]. That is a control that prevents 
state administrators from acting arbitrarily," he said. 
<H5>  No Conditions </H5>
  Meanwhile, two DPR members from other factions, namely Ali 
Hardi Kiaidemak of the FPP [Development Unity Faction] and Y.B. 
Wiyanjono of the F-PDI [PDI Faction] said in separate interviews 
that the idea and spirit of single majority are acceptable for 
all political parties as long as there are no conditions. If the 
situation is otherwise, however, the worry over dictatorship of 
the majority and tyranny of the minority is justifiable. 
  According to Kiaidemak, all political parties have the 
desire 
to be big, but that desire should not bring about practices 
outside the democratic concept. He said he is confident that as 
long as all political players adhere to the democratic concept, 
a single majority will not bring forth a terrible dictatorship 
or tyranny. 
  Wiyanjono, however, said that if the single majority sets 
conditions, as it does now, he is confident that sooner or later 
it will create an unhealthy political climate. This is 
particularly true if it produces a tendency toward unfairness to 
other political parties. "Thus, I support what Megawati said," 
Wiyanjono said. 
  Through spokesman Taheri Noor, the ABRI [Indonesian Armed 
Forces] Faction stressed that the single majority issue depends 
on the aspect from which it is viewed. If seen from the liberal 
aspect, a single majority admittedly could create dictatorship 
and tyranny. If viewed from the aspect of Pancasila, however, 
that will not happen. 
  "Therefore, we must establish the concept or point of view 
of 
single majority. We should not hastily draw conclusions that 
could produce a high level of polemic," said Taheri. 
  Under the Pancasila concept there is no such term as 
"dictatorship" or "tyranny." There is only deliberation and 
consensus, which can be achieved despite the existence of a 
single majority. Therefore, the single majority must be retained. 
<H5>  Interferes With Consensus </H5>
  On the other hand, political observer Dr. Afan Gaffar 
stressed that the single majority idea clearly can interfere 
with the process of achieving consensus through deliberation. 
The majority party will use every means to achieve victory for 
its programs, especially those related to political interests. 
On the other side, minority parties will find it difficult to 
present proposals. 
  "A single majority is still needed, however, and everyone 
has 
the right to be the single majority. In fact, if GOLKAR wins 
only 40 percent of the vote in the next general elections, it 
will still be the majority sociopolitical organization. That 
will be especially true if it is supported by 100 DPR members 
from the ABRI Faction," said the instructor from the staff of 
the UGM [Gadjah Mada University] Sociology and Political Science 
Faculty. 
  "Actually, a party's becoming a single majority is not a 
problem, as long as it is done democratically. In other words, 
there should be no voting fraud or holding of seminars on how to 
vote that profit only a particular party," he said. 
  In this connection, Afan Gaffar feels that there is indeed a 
need to revise the implementation of general elections, because 
although there have been improvements in quality since 1971, the 
improvements have not been significant. Under revised general 
election implementation, it is hoped that each sociopolitical 
organization will be able to do its utmost to seek voter 
support, consistent with existing political norms and ethics. 
"The question is whether GOLKAR will want to approve changes in 
the general election law, which has benefited GOLKAR," Afan 
Gaffar said.

<F P=106> [Article by Nanang Junaedi and Masduki Baidlawi: "NU (Muslim </F>
Scholars League) and Muhammadiyah Prepare for Succession"] 
  [Text] Succession. This is the most sacred issue in the 
realities of Indonesian politics. It not only triggers 
controversy, but produces long discourses and polemics, as well. 
It is also a question that always intrudes into the territory of 
other issues and often generates a separate controversy. 
  One of the controversies involves the "difference in 
opinion" 
between two young leaders who come from the same "home": 
Muhammadiyah. The recommendations of Amien Rais regarding 
criteria for national leadership in 1998--which reportedly point 
to B.J. Habibie--were directly countered by Din Syamsuddin's 
"political prayer" for Try Sutrisno. What is actually happening? 
  There are a number of analyses, such as the one by Marzuki 
Darusman. This political observer, who is also a lecturer at the 
University of Indonesia, frankly calls the phenomenon a 
"reflection of the internal struggle in the Muhammadiyah 
organization." That is not all. From a broader perspective, 
Marzuki in fact sees this phenomenon as a "symbiosis" involving 
Muhammadiyah leaders who are members of the ICMI [Indonesian 
Muslim Intellectuals Association]. "What Amien Rais asserted is 
clearly an expression of ICMI voices in Muhammadiyah," he said, 
summing up. 
  It is an attractive political step. Therefore, there is 
another matter, apart from the "difference of opinion," that 
should be examined in connection with the spread of this 
succession issue. "This is proof that Muhammadiyah has been able 
to produce new players for the political arena," Marzuki 
declared. By "nominating" Habibie, according to Marzuki, Amien 
Rais's position in Muhammadiyah is certain to be more dominant. 
Moreover, "It is hard to believe that Muhammadiyah does not 
understand the political implications of the step it has taken." 
What does this mean? 
  Within Muhammadiyah itself, he said, a struggle is going on. 
By nominating Habibie, Amien's position in Muhammadiyah is 
certain to be more dominant, especially with respect to 
relations between Muhammadiyah and the ICMI. Regardless, 
Muhammadiyah, one of the largest Islamic organizations, is 
increasingly presenting itself as a political force that needs 
to be reckoned with in the Islamic political constellation in 
Indonesia. 
  Indications of this began to appear when the ICMI was 
founded 
in December 1990. Prominent Muhammadiyah figures--besides people 
from HMI [Islamic College Students Association] and other 
Islamic mass organizations--became ICMI's "backbone" among 
nonbureaucrats. The occurrence of the Muhammadiyah Congress in 
the same month and year further emphasized this phenomenon. 
Through its congress, Muhammadiyah was successful in 
regenerating leadership, from older people to younger ones. 
  From the younger circles--especially intellectuals--emerged 
the names of Amien Rais, Watiek Pratiknya, Ahmad Syafii Ma'arif, 
and several other prominent young people. In fact, Din 
Syamsuddin, a young Muhammadiyah personage, also in the end 
became a member of the GOLKAR [Functional Group] DPP [Central 
Executive Council] as a result of the creation of the 
Harmoko-Habibie "duet" at the recent national conference. 
  Meanwhile, NU [Muslim Scholars League] figures are truly 
acting outside the fence. Young NU personage Slamet Efendi 
Yusuf, DPR [Parliament] member from the F-KP [GOLKAR Faction], 
who previously was a member of the GOLKAR DPP under Wahono's 
leadership, has been active outside the fence. Also, NU people 
in the ICMI did not demonstrate any significant role. "They 
merely went with the flow of the existing ICMI mainstream." 
  Therefore, when succession does occur, for example, many 
people predict that NU masses as a political potential will turn 
to ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] as the strategic group. 
Reflections of that appear in the closeness between NU Muslim 
scholars and Vice President Try Sutrisno. According to Taufik 
Abdullah, one of Indonesia's foremost historians, the NU has 
been going through a very disturbing process of transition since 
1984, when it returned to the 1926 Policy. 
  After leaving the political world, the NU began to look 
inward: It turned out that the NU has only Muslim scholars and 
Islamic boarding schools. "What are NU's assets compared to 
those of Muhammadiyah? There are none. Therefore, this process 
of transition within the NU can be very painful," said Taufik 
Abdullah. Previously, while the NU was still political, Muslim 
scholars could say, "Let us choose politics...." Now, there is 
no alternative to improving whatever there is on the inside, 
while confronting extraordinary political temptations from the 
outside. 
  According to Prof. Mitsuo Nakamura, author of the book 
The Crescent Rises Over the Banyan Tree: A Study of the 
Muhammadiyah Movement in a Central Javanese Town (Cornell 
University, Ithaca, 1976), as of 1992 there were no signs that 
Muhammadiyah was experiencing any change in the orientation of 
its religious struggle. 
  Moreover, despite the existence of desires to participate 
more actively in the political process, it is unlikely that 
Muhammadiyah will take part as a political organization, he 
said. Nevertheless, he said, it attracted considerable attention 
when at its conference in Surabaya it touched on the issue of 
criteria for national succession. "Perhaps this is one form of 
contribution to Indonesia, which is now seeking a formula for 
openness and democratization. Naturally, this needs to be 
observed further," he said. 
  Changes in Indonesian political life, including the fact 
that 
a Muhammadiyah personage mentions the matter of 
succession--while Pak Harto [President Suharto] has not been 
president for even a year--shows the reality that Indonesia has 
entered a new phase, one that has never occurred before. From 
the international point of view, Nakamura said, this change will 
improve Indonesia's image. Indonesia is a Southern nation on 
which many hopes are pinned. It also is a market that should be 
reckoned with. Thus, he said, Indonesia's legitimacy and 
prestige as a democratic country are on the increase. 
  As for differences within Muhammadiyah regarding succession, 
he stressed that they are merely natural. In fact, open debate, 
for example, should be appreciated. It is true that, as Taufik 
Abdullah said, Muhammadiyah is accustomed to differences of 
opinion before decisions are made. Besides, its involvement in 
politics has not been by the organization, but by people in it. 
Differences of opinion may exist also because Muhammadiyah has 
never had a central figure like the general chairman of the NU. 
This apparently is what makes the difference between 
Muhammadiyah and the NU. 
  Whatever the case, said Arbi Sanit, the Islamic community 
will never be united as a political force. Because the Islamic 
community is a large but diffuse force, the force will be 
dispersed everywhere when succession occurs.

  [Text] PANGAB [Armed Forced Commander] General Feisal 
Tanjung believes that there have been several notable cases 
recently which have damaged the credibility of ABRI [Republic of 
Indonesia Armed Forces] and POLRI [Republic of Indonesia Police] 
and which have had political consequences; intelligence agencies 
did not detect these cases early enough, preventive steps were 
taken too slowly, and KAMTIBMAS [Public Security and Order] did 
not react immediately to the early detection of the symptoms 
which then developed into those cases. 
  "In addition, the leaders and the managers did not act at a 
high professional level to overcome critical situations 
involving the masses," the MENPANGAB [Minister/Armed Forces 
Commander] said yesterday when he gave the welcoming address at 
roll-call ceremonies for deputy heads of provincial police, 
heads of the regional police, and heads of sub-area police at 
the Police Education Center in Sukabumi, West Java. 
  Notable cases which the MENPANGAB said have damaged the 
credibility of ABRI/POLRI include the Banturujeg (Majalengka) 
case, in which some people were killed; the Sei Lepan local 
transmigration case, in which there was an attack on the 
Pangkalan Brandan Sector Police Headquarters; the case involving 
peasant dissatisfaction towards the Rancamaya (Bogor) real 
estate project; the case of the Nipah (Sampang) dam, which led 
to the death of several demonstrators; the case of the worker 
Marsinah in East Java; and the destruction and burning of 
Indramayon Inc.'s employee housing in Sumatra. 
  The MENPANGAB thinks that weak coordination between 
ABRI/POLRI officials and the agencies involved in facing these 
critical problems have also resulted in decreased credibility. 
  The decreased credibility, according to the PANGAB, was also 
caused by poor management, particularly command of the initial 
data, control in the field, and control over the firearms given 
to the members of the units. 
  In addition, he said, the lack of emphasis placed on 
carrying 
out duties, including firm procedures for personal security and 
operational security for members carrying out their duties, also 
played a role in that decreased credibility.

  [Text] In a short time a highly respected institution--in 
fact some considered it unapproachable--will be history. It is 
the Strategic Intelligence Agency (BAIS) of ABRI [Republic of 
Indonesia Armed Forces], which was recently scheduled to change 
form. It will be renamed the ABRI Intelligence Agency (BIA). It 
will have a slimmer organization and fewer personnel than BAIS. 
"In accordance with the needs of the time, a large BAIS is no 
longer needed at the present time," said a high-ranking official 
commenting on the plans for change. 
  More important, this intelligence agency will have a lower 
line of command. According to TEMPO's source, BIA will no longer 
be directly under the commanding general of ABRI's line of 
command, as is BAIS, which is presently headed by the commanding 
general of ABRI. The head of BIA, according to that source, will 
ex officio be the assistant for intelligence to the chief of the 
General Staff (ASINTEL KASUM) of ABRI. However, according to 
other high-ranking officers, it is still possible that BIA will 
be an independent agency under the supervision of ABRI's KASUM 
[chief of the General Staff], a position now held by Lieutenant 
General H.L. Mantiri. In that case, BIA will not be a separate 
agency with easy access to everything. 
  It is said that Gen. Feisal Tanjung, commanding general of 
ABRI, recently reported to the president that BAIS will be 
changed into BIA. However, the commanding general of ABRI could 
not make an official announcement of the change because some 
details still have to be looked into. "So, this might not be 
announced until next week (meaning this week)," Brigadier 
General Syarwan Hamid, head of ABRI's Information Center, told 
TEMPO last Wednesday [19 January] in Jakarta. 
  This plan has been in preparation for a long time, since 
Feisal Tanjung became commanding general of ABRI after the MPR's 
[Parliament] general session in March 1993. ABRI Headquarters 
formed a team to work on the change. In fact, according to a 
former high-ranking officer of BAIS, this has been under 
discussion for some years. Changing the structure of BAIS is to 
make it more efficient. "But changing the organizational 
structure and decreasing the number of personnel doesn't mean 
that the organization will be any less important," he continued. 
  These changes appear to be consistent with the times, which 
no longer require that the security apparatus, especially those 
active in the field of military intelligence, act with a "tight 
fit." Nowadays, he went on to say, given the issues of 
democratization and human rights, whether we want to or not, the 
security apparatus is being asked to act with more of a "loose 
fit." He meant that we only hope that the BIA will limit its 
role to suggesting actions which will prevent political, social, 
and economic destabilization. 
  It was different, that retired high-ranking officer 
continued, in the era of "tight fit," which allowed BAIS to 
carry out direct actions against those considered "enemies of 
the state"; for example, imprisonment without due process. 
  The day-to-day operations of the old intelligence agency 
(BAIS), an organization under the direct control of the 
commanding general of ABRI, were led by the deputy chairman, an 
office now held by Major General Arie Sudewo. This agency has 
eight directorates, each led by a director with the rank of one 
star, i.e., brigadier general. This does not include the task 
units (SATGAS), which handle special areas. 
  This agency has really become a filter for every activity 
here; for example it screens candidates to the DPR/MPR 
[Parliament/People's Consultative Assembly], candidates to 
high-ranking government posts, diplomats who are going to be 
assigned overseas and even BUMN [state-owned company] officials. 
One important part of BAIS is Directorate A. They say that this 
directorate has a wide scope of operations because it covers 
domestic political, social, economic and cultural problems. Its 
present director is Brigadier General Agum Gumelar. It is this 
directorate which is well known as having the largest number of 
aides (PABAN); it has six of them. It is not surprising that 
members of this directorate have been present at various 
domestic political incidents. For example, Brig. Gen. Agum 
played a role in "bringing order to" PDI's [Indonesian Democracy 
Party] National Congress in Jakarta in December 1993, at which 
Megawati Soekarnoputri was elected general chairman. 
  BAIS operations also seem to have played a big role in 
Indonesian political history, such as dealing with opposition 
groups in East Timor and with those referred to as "disturbers 
of the peace" in Aceh. This military intelligence agency has 
played such an important role that it is not surprising that it 
has become more prestigious than, for example, the State 
Intelligence Coordinating Board (BAKIN), an agency given the 
task of coordinating all existing intelligence agencies. 
  However, the conspicuous role played by BAIS is 
understandable because it has networks at several levels. At the 
territorial level, for example, BAIS can take advantage of 
ABRI's existing apparatus, i.e., KODAM [Military Area Command], 
KOREM [Military Sub-Area Command], KODIM [Military District 
Command] and KORAMIL [Military Precinct Command], and in fact, 
if necessary, as far down as the BABINSA [village management 
noncommissioned officer] at the village level. On the other 
hand, BAKIN, as a coordinating body, does not need a 
wide-ranging network, even though it has a limited number of 
field "correspondents." 
  BAIS plays an important role, and the strength of this 
agency 
can also be seen in the number of BAIS "alumni" who have gone on 
to hold important positions within ABRI and in government 
administration. Because, according to one of its "alumni," 
holding a position in BAIS means having the opportunity to learn 
about territorial problems and national sociopolitical problems 
at the same time. 
  Lieutenant General (at that time) L.B. Moerdani, who was 
promoted to commanding general of ABRI for the period 1983 to 
1988 and minister of defense and security from 1988 to 1993, 
came out of BAIS headquarters on Saharjo Street in the Tebet 
area of South Jakarta. A number of the aides who were with Benny 
Moerdani when he led the Strategic Intelligence Center--before 
it became BAIS--have become key leaders in ABRI and the 
government. Examples are Admiral (retired) M. Arifin (former 
Navy chief of staff); Rear Admiral (ret.) Sudibjo Rahardjo 
(former KASUM ABRI), now ambassador to Singapore; Rear Marshal 
(ret.) Teddy Rusdi (former assistant for general planning); 
Major General (ret.) Nugroho (former junior attorney general for 
intelligence and secretary general of the Department of Home 
Affairs); and Lieutenant General (ret.) Sudibyo, who still heads 
BAKIN. There are also a number of other high-ranking officers 
who have risen fast, such as Major General A.M. Hendropriyono 
(commander of the Greater Jakarta Military Area Command) and 
Brigadier General Agum Gumelar (commander of Special Mission 
Forces). 
  The conspicuous role that BAIS has played is the work of its 
founder, L.B. Moerdani. This agency goes back to the Strategic 
Intelligence Center (PUSINTELSTRAT), which was under the command 
of ABRI Headquarters. Benny Moerdani has headed that agency 
since 1977 and he has also been assistant for intelligence at 
ABRI Headquarters since 1974. In the late 1970's and the early 
1980's he was also entrusted with the task of heading two other 
important intelligence agencies: he was deputy head of BAKIN and 
head of intelligence at KOPKAMTIB [Operational Command for the 
Restoration of Security and Order]. 
  Not long after Lieut. Gen. Benny was inaugurated as 
commanding general of ABRI in 1983, PUSINTELSTRAT became BAIS. 
Richard Tanter, an Australian observer of Indonesian 
intelligence agencies, thinks that BAIS was formed due to the 
efforts made by Benny, who thought that ABRI needed a 
centralized and professional intelligence agency. "It was needed 
to watch over even the smallest activities and to have the 
ability to prevent or, if necessary, take action against 
activities not approved by the government," said Tanter, who now 
teaches at Kyoto University. 
  He also said that the formation of BAIS, with all its 
authority, was inspired by Gen. Benny's observation of the South 
Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) in the 1970's, when he 
served as defense attache in that country. "Benny very much 
wanted to create a more professional and sophisticated ABRI 
intelligence agency," Tanter told TEMPO. 
  Although Benny was already the commanding general of ABRI, 
he 
still held the position of head of BAIS. For day-to-day 
operations he was helped by the deputy chairman of BAIS, at that 
time Maj. Gen. Sutaryo. After he was no longer commanding 
general of ABRI and head of BAIS, Benny Moerdani (later to 
become minister of defense and security) continued to be very 
influential at the "Saharjo office." 
  In his doctoral dissertation at Monash University in 
Australia, entitled "Intelligence Agencies in Third World 
Militarisation, a Case Study of Indonesia 1966-1989," Tanter 
describes how at that time the deputy chairman of BAIS, Maj. 
Gen. Sutaryo, reported to two bosses: Try Sutrisno, commanding 
general of ABRI, and Benny Moerdani, minister of defense and 
security. 
  This structure, in which the head of BAIS was also the 
commanding general of ABRI, was heavily criticized, even though 
it was considered effective. "Intelligence must be separate from 
direct force. Intelligence must be independent," said Sutopo 
Yuwono, former head of BAKIN. The products of intelligence 
should stop at the stage of a "report" to the power holders. The 
power holders will make policy based on those intelligence 
reports. But since there are functions and posts held by both 
the power holders and the intelligence agencies at the same 
time, the results of the intelligence reports can be used to 
create power. 
  So Sutopo welcomes the plans for restructuring ABRI's 
intelligence bodies. "That's the way it should have been," he 
said. The head of BIA will not be the commanding general of ABRI 
as well. The number of directorates will also be reduced from 
eight to five (see diagram). 
  The change in structure will not make BIA's scope of 
operations very different from those of BAIS. The scope of 
operations, put simply, can still be formulated as an agency 
which estimates threats within a strategic range which might 
endanger the state, especially those connected with domestic and 
foreign social, political, economic, and cultural problems. At 
the same time, ASINTEL, structurally below ABRI's KASUM, will 
deal with matters directly connected with ABRI's operational 
tactics and strategies. In other words, whatever its name and 
position within an organization, "intelligence remains ABRI's 
eyes and ears". 
  So who will be the first head of BIA? Rumors are that it 
will 
be Major General Arie Sudewo, the present deputy head of BAIS. 
In fact, rumors are that he will also hold the position of 
ASINTEL KASUM of ABRI. These changes will invite attention. Some 
people are pleased and some are still taking a "wait-and-see" 
attitude. Some people connect these changes with the 
government's response to society's demands for a lower approach 
to security. And some people connect them with government 
efforts to present a democratic image. 
  As retired Brig. Gen. Soedibjo, former defense attache in 
Moscow and now on the staff of the Indonesian Strategic Studies 
Agency, said, "Such tight control, supported by a complex 
organization, might no longer be necessary." For example, the 
problem of the recent flare-up of demonstrations. As long as 
those demonstrations are not aimed at overthrowing the 
government or replacing the constitution, "Let the police handle 
it; you don't need the intelligence agencies. People don't feel 
restrained any more." 
  However, there are some who are not completely sure that 
these changes have any great importance for Indonesian political 
life. Changing the structure of BAIS into BIA is like "changing 
your hat." The objective is the same. Whether it is more of a 
"tight fit" or a "loose fit" depends completely on who is using 
those "eyes and ears." 
  Or, as Tanter said, at first glance BIA will play less of a 
role than BAIS. "Maybe there will be a change in operational 
style and method. But I'm not convinced that its influence and 
power will diminish," he said. But he would still like to know 
who the head of BIA and its five directors will be, and what 
their influence on and relations with the commanding general of 
ABRI and the president will be, which are certainly much further 
away.

  Yudo Swasono, temporary acting head of the Manpower Planning 
and Development Board, made this statement to MERDEKA after 
giving a presentation on Monday (20 December) in Jakarta at a 
one-day seminar on the role of women in the economic sector. 
  In connection with this presentation, Yudo Swasono said that 
a reexamination of the labor laws which regulate the problems of 
female workers would also be carried out. 
  He explained that the labor regulations which regulate the 
problems of a female worker's employment in a corporation have 
been considered excessive. He was referring to the protection of 
female workers. He believes that excessive protection will make 
it difficult for female workers to compete with male workers in 
the labor market. 
  Among the labor regulations about female workers to be 
examined by the Department of Manpower are the problems of 
menstrual leave, maternal leave, and so forth. "If we consider 
it necessary to supplement them, we will supplement them; but if 
they should be reduced, things which are not fitting will be 
deleted," affirmed Yudo Swasono. 
  Yudo believes that a reevaluation of the regulations is very 
important for the development of the female workers themselves. 
What he means is that women should have the same work 
opportunities as men. Up to now women have been discriminated 
against. 
  For example, the field of manpower training is still largely 
dominated by men. Even though they (the women) are being 
trained, applying this training is difficult. Yudo believes that 
this also affects the level of productivity of the corporation 
concerned. 
  In answer to a question about female workers' productivity, 
Yudo said that the level of productivity basically depends on 
their level of education and training. At this point the level 
of education of female workers is still considered low; "and 
existing BLK's (vocational training halls) cannot yet guarantee 
increased worker productivity," he stated. 
  For that reason, the minister of manpower is also going to 
carry out a large-scale evaluation of the quality of existing 
BLK's. One of the matters to be looked at is BKL membership, 
which is still dominated by men. For that reason, one of the 
future targets of this BLK evaluation is to develop female 
worker productivity as a human resource.

  [Text] As a result of a lack of business ethics, which are 
the basis of doing business, big businesses have grabbed all of 
the business opportunities which should have been available to 
medium and small businesses. Business ethics can be upheld if 
anticorruption legislation and the oath of office are really 
upheld by firm and strict sanctions. 
  This is a summary of the opinions expressed by Michael V. 
Haribowo, vice president of the Modern Group, and by Priasmoro 
Prawiroardjo, deputy president director of Lippo Indonesia's BNP 
[expansion not given], when they were contacted separately 
yesterday in Jakarta, in response to Minister of Finance Mar'ie 
Muhammad's statement that a stop must be put to the degradation 
of business morals (KOMPAS, Wednesday 22 December). 
  At the same time, Prof. Dr. Sri-Edi Swasono, general 
chairman 
of the Indonesian Cooperative Board (DEKOPIN), believes that the 
gap in control over the economy makes for a very shaky harmony 
in Indonesia. 
  Michael thinks that although the business ethics of big 
businesses are not noticeably fading away, in a real sense we 
are feeling this. "We don't notice them caring about giving 
smaller or even midsized companies room for business 
opportunities," he said. 
  In fact, what we're seeing is greed and a constant struggle 
for opportunities, and these attitudes are more in the forefront 
than those of wanting to provide others with the same 
opportunities. As a result, every area of business activity 
which should provide the smaller members of the business world 
with business opportunities is now closed off or obscure. Little 
by little the businesses which have become big because they were 
given the chance by the government have taken over all the 
opportunities. 
  The warning suddenly expressed by the minister of finance, 
said Michael, appears to be a signal about this situation. At 
the very least his words reflect the government's wish to ask 
the conglomerates to slow down and to give some of the 
opportunities to medium and small businesses. 
<H5>  Depends on the "Conductor" </H5>
  However, said Michael, it is up to the "master conductor" to 
change the rhythm of what was playing. Whether or not the 
situation can be changed depends on the capabilities of the 
maestro. "The problem is that we must realize that changing the 
rhythm is not an easy task. But to do so requires perseverance 
and a firm attitude". 
  On the other hand, he said, the conglomerates themselves 
must 
begin to realize themselves that the opportunities which they 
have been given and which have made them grow can be used to 
help others. At the very least they must move forward and open 
up access to a wider market while the small-scale domestic 
market can be given over to small and medium businesses. 
  However, the excuses given up to now--the need for 
consolidation and the lack of antimonopoly legislation--have 
just been self-serving. 
  "The only question now is whether all the parties concerned, 
including the minister of finance, are capable of giving a 
warning, without needing to damage all of the parties concerned, 
but by appealing to the innermost self that all human beings 
possess to help and to give all parties an opportunity," he said. 
<H5>  Upholding the Oath of Office </H5>
  Priasmoro believes that we can put a stop to the moral 
degradation of the business community and office holders, which 
is now raging through society, by implementing anticorruption 
legislation and by upholding the oath of office. Upholding 
morality can also be accelerated by the political will and firm 
discipline of the parties holding the keys to government office. 
If we don't start from that line, urging people to uphold 
morality will only be laughed at by the business community. 
  He thinks that the minister of finance's statement about the 
need to put a stop to the moral degradation of the business 
community is well based. "That statement comes from someone who 
certainly has a lot of experience with corruption, especially 
since he once was the director general of taxation, which is 
also a problem area for corruption," he said. 
  Priasmoro said that there must be a core of bureaucrats who 
are prepared to begin to uphold those ethical principles. "The 
minister of finance himself, who has dealt with a lot of 
agencies which had corruption problems, can first put those 
initiatives into effect within the Department of Finance. If 
upholding ethical principles goes well over there, it will 
automatically become an example for other agencies," he said. 
<H5>  Economic Harmony Is Shaky </H5>
  In a separate statement, Sri-Edi Swasono thinks that it is 
everyone's duty to create a connection between big and small 
business communities so as to narrow the present gap between 
them and, at the same time, guarantee business harmony. 
  He revealed these thoughts yesterday in a conversation with 
a 
reporter in Ceper, Klaten. Edi Swasono is in Central Java to 
attend the ceremony transferring the liquidity credit facilities 
of the Bank of Indonesia (KLBI) to the 11 members of the Batur 
Jaya Cooperative via the Universal Bank. 
  Abdul Rachman Ramly, chairman of the board of Astra 
International, accompanied by Palgunadi T. Setiawan, chairman of 
the Astra Yayasan Dharma Bhakti [Charity Foundation] (YDBA), 
explained that Astra is committed to involving small and medium 
businesses in its activities. "We have planned and been 
committed to those steps since 1980," Ramly affirmed. 
  To implement that commitment, every year Astra sets aside 2 
percent of its net profits to help small and medium businesses. 
"Giving money to the partnership is not enough. We also help 
with management, apprenticeships and education. All of Astra's 
facilities are open for study to the businesses that enter 
Astra's partnership program," Ramly said. 
  Palgunadi, who is also the managing director of Astra Mitra 
Ventura, added that besides setting aside that 2 percent, which 
is spent on helping small and medium businesses, Astra also sets 
aside 2 percent of its net profits for venture capital. These 
funds are provided for helping with the capitalization of those 
small and medium businesses which are considered suitable, and 
Astra's participation in this cooperation is limited to a 
maximum of 10 years. 
  Up to the present time, Palgunadi said, Astra Mitra Ventura 
has about 7.5 billion rupiahs in funds. Only about 1.4 billion 
rupiahs of those funds have been used so far. "We hope that the 
small and medium businesses getting that funding are not limited 
to the nine companies getting it now. However, choosing the 
proper companies for the program is not a simple matter," 
Palgunadi explained. 
  Edi Swasono thinks that the steps taken by Astra 
International Inc to set aside some of its profits for fostering 
cooperatives and small industries are positive steps. He does 
not see many big businesses which have the kind of program that 
Astra has for fostering other companies. Big businesses often 
believe that it is enough to give small businesses and 
cooperatives something material, such as stock.

  [Text] On Monday (20 December) about 400 workers from PBI 
(Purna Bina Indonesia) Inc. in Bontang complained to the East 
Kalimantan DPRD I [Provincial Parliament] in Samarinda. They 
complained about the application of minimum wage standards and 
about the payment of vacation and overtime pay, which have not 
complied with regulations. According to I Made Surata, a 
representative of the workers, who was received by the East 
Kalimantan DPRD, they were forced to come to Samarinda after 
their efforts to solve the problem at the district level were 
not successful. As former employees of PBI Inc., they met with 
the company and the Department of Manpower as well as with the 
SPSI [All-Indonesia Workers Association] in Bontang on 30 
November; however, as of the third week of December they had not 
arrived at any solution. 
  The construction and engineering workers who worked on Badak 
Inc.'s Train F of the liquid natural gas plant in Bontang 
arrived in Samarinda (120 km away) in 13 buses. H. Syarifuddin 
Gairach, deputy chairman of the East Kalimantan DPRD I, and 
leaders of the parliamentary factions met with seven 
representatives of the workers. 
  Made Surata said that according to the minimum wage 
standards 
set by the government the workers should receive 108,000 rupiahs 
per month. In fact, 750 workers at PBI Inc. Bontang were being 
paid only between 65,000 and 103,000 rupiahs per month. Besides 
that, according to the work agreement which they and the company 
had signed, they were required to work seven hours a day. But in 
fact they were made to work for eight hours without being paid 
overtime. The workers also brought up some rights which the 
company had violated, including making them work on Sunday and 
not contributing to their health and annual leave funds. 
<H5>  Flare-Ups </H5>
  President Suharto is due to dedicate official operations of 
the Bontang Train F liquid natural gas plant about the beginning 
of February. Representatives of the former workers who went to 
see the East Kalimantan DPRD I leaders asked them to intervene 
and find a solution to their problems. If not, they intend to 
bring the problems up when the plant is dedicated. 
  Syarifuddin Gairach, deputy chairman of the East Kalimantan 
DPRD I, said that they would listen to the problems presented by 
the workers and convey them to the agencies concerned. 
Furthermore, the DPRD would look into the efforts to resolve the 
violations of workers' rights. The East Kalimantan provincial 
office of the Department of Labor hopes that the workers will be 
patient until a meeting planned for Thursday (23 December) is 
held. 
  In Samarinda itself there are frequent labor flare-ups 
because there are many companies which are thought to be 
violating workers' rights. A demonstration demanding payment of 
wages was held by 1,600 workers of HJP (Hartaty Jaya Plywood) 
Inc., which is located in the Loabakung industrial area, 
Samarinda Ulu. They made this demand because the company had not 
paid them for three months. 
  Even the governor of East Kalimantan got involved in this 
problem because while HJP Inc. has been facing a financial 
crisis in Samarinda, Hartono T. Sentoso, the managing director, 
has been in Los Angeles since the beginning of the year. The 
company was finally able to pay the 1,600 workers their wages on 
1 December after the BDN [Bank Dagang Negara] injected some 
funds into the company. 
<H5>  No SPSI Unit Yet </H5>
  After the HJP case was settled, another wage demand was made 
by about 370 workers from JPP (Jati Prima Pratama) Inc. in 
Loajanan and Nikita Inc. in Palaran, both involved in the wood 
industry. The workers complained to the East Kalimantan DPRD I 
on 15 December. Workers from the two companies, which are in the 
same group, demanded the wages which had not been paid for three 
months. 
  Workers from the two companies said that management always 
promises to pay what they owe them whenever they demand it. The 
most recent promise was for 15 December. When the promise was 
not kept, they were forced to complain to the East Kalimantan 
DPRD I in Loabahu. 
  Leaders of the East Kalimantan DPRD I asked the workers to 
be 
patient while the agencies concerned were asked to contact the 
companies in order solve the problem right away. According to 
the explanation given to KOMPAS, the two companies are in fact 
having financial problems. Nanang Ismail, chairman of the 
Samarinda SPSI, said that it was hard to look into the problems 
faced by workers from those two companies because no SPSI unit 
existed there yet.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] Up to now no efforts have been made to stop or 
control the growth of the rapidly increasing gap in society. In 
fact, it is as if without realizing it every deregulation 
accelerates the growth of this social gap. The reason is that 
big businesses have developed and expanded through improper 
competition. 
  The Review Board of KADIN (Indonesian Chamber of Commerce) 
made these statements in the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce's 
Evaluation of Activities for 1989 to 1994, which was distributed 
last week. This evaluation was signed directly by the chairman 
of KADIN's Review Board (MP) H. Probosutedjo. 
  In its general evaluation of the business world, KADIN's 
Review Board also said that big businesses are in control of 
various business sectors, from upstream to downstream. Big 
business control of business is noticeable and real, that is, 
they control it vertically and horizontally. 
  KADIN's MP also said that there is too great a discrepancy 
between the wealth or assets owned by small and medium 
businesses and by BUMN's (state-owned businesses) on the one 
hand and the wealth or assets owned by big businesses, 
especially those that are really big businesses, on the other 
hand, and "that it has resulted in a social gap which is getting 
wider and deeper." 
  "The growth of the gap between big businesses and other 
businesses is greater than the growth of the economy, and there 
aren't any effective efforts being made to prevent, control, or 
put a stop to the growth of this gap." 
<H5>  What Other Theory? </H5>
  KADIN's MP concluded that KADIN must play an active role in 
overcoming this problem for PANCASILA [Five Principles of the 
Nation] harmony and unity by creating cooperation between the 
conglomerates on the one hand and the small and medium 
businesses, cooperatives, and BUMN's on the other hand. This is 
something that is "absolutely necessary." 
  "The trickle-down theory, the theory of `foster child, 
foster 
parent,' and the theory of a piece of the pie, have not become a 
reality. What other theories will we have to go through in order 
to bring about a total Development Trilogy? In this respect, 
KADIN must really be able to create national harmony within a 
PANCASILA society." 
  KADIN's MP also made a special evaluation of each player in 
the national economy. Many of the BUMN businesses, they said, 
are declining. Many are not healthy and in fact are sick. 
  Meanwhile, the cooperatives are growing slowly, not in line 
with expectations, and "not in line with Article 33 of the 1945 
Constitution for creating PANCASILA." The mandate of Article 33 
of the 1945 Constitution, that the cooperatives should be the 
cornerstone of the economy, is still far from expectations. 
Cooperation between big businesses and the cooperatives and 
between the business world in general and the cooperatives is 
still very weak. 
  Meanwhile, the growth of the private sector, particularly 
small businesses, has also been very slow. Among the reasons for 
this is the difficulty of obtaining funds, especially the credit 
expected from government banks. Permanent Working Capital Credit 
(KMKP), Small Investment Credit (KIK), and Candak Kulak [the 
credit system for small businesses] have not been very 
successful. Small-Business Credit (KUK) was in fact misused by 
big businesses. 
  Many small businesses have also been squeezed by the 
expansion and development of big businesses, which have been 
growing through improper and destructive competition. For 
example, when markets are remodeled, small businesses usually 
lose their original selling place because the cost of a stall is 
set beyond their ability to pay. 
  In addition to being squeezed out of their place of 
business, 
many small businesses have gone bankrupt, unable to compete with 
big businesses which develop their businesses from upstream to 
downstream on the grounds of free enterprise. Up to now there 
have been no attempts to stop or control improper competition. 
In fact, "Indonesian competition goes further than free 
competition in the liberal capitalist nations." 
  KADIN's MP said that medium businesses have almost the same 
problems as small businesses. Many medium-scale businesses are 
being squeezed and are getting smaller as a result of not being 
able to compete with big businesses, which are always expanding 
and developing through improper competition. 
  The result is that many midsized businesses, like small 
businesses, are tangled up in bank credit. They cannot pay the 
installments on their loans or pay the interest. A further 
result is that many of the guarantees of medium and small 
businesses have finally been turned over to the PUPN [State 
Credit Affairs Committee] (now called the BUPLN, the State 
Auction and Credit Affairs Board). 
<H5>  Unable To Compete </H5>
  Big businesses usually have smooth channels of communication 
with government banks and with state officials; they have very 
close relations with businessmen, which enables the businesses 
to run smoothly. On the contrary, the heads of medium and small 
businesses and of BUMN's do not have this ability to communicate 
directly with those in charge or with the bank officials or 
government agencies concerned. The result is that small and 
medium businesses and BUMN's are unable to compete with big 
businesses and even less so with conglomerates. 
  KADIN's MP also said that in general provincial businesses 
in 
the 27 provinces have been left far behind. 
  KADIN's evaluation was issued at the same time that the list 
of candidates for KADIN directors and for members of KADIN's MP 
was drafted. For this purpose KADIN's MP held a series of 
meetings with groups of company associations and with business 
associations. MP held marathon meetings with certain 
cooperatives, BUMN's, and members of the private sector from 16 
to 21 November. 
<H5>  Requirements for KADIN's General Chairman </H5>
  In SK [Directive] 092/MP/XII/93 KADIN's MP also issued the 
requirements and criteria for candidates to membership in the 
MP, for general chairman and for the board of directors for the 
period 1994 to 1998. 
  It was decided that the MP would submit a list of 
nominations 
to KADIN's Second National Congress, which would contain the 
names of 120 candidates for KADIN's MP and the names of 200 
candidates for KADIN's Executive Committee for the period 1994 
to 1998. 
  KADIN's MP arrived at eight requirements for general 
chairman. They include administrative requirements, such as 
having already filled out a form for KADIN's MP. There also are 
personal requirements, such as: a person who is experienced, who 
is successful, and who has shown his dedication to KADIN. 
  In addition, it should be someone who understands and is 
able 
to defend the interests of the business world and who is a 
leader. The last requirement is someone who has not been in 
trouble with the law, which includes not having had any trouble 
with security or defense. 
<H5>  Supported </H5>
  At the same time, Aburizal Bakrie, chairman of the board of 
the Bakrie Group, told KOMPAS last week that he supports the 
criteria for a candidate for KADIN's general chairman set by 
KADIN's MP. Given these criteria, he thinks that the head of 
KADIN will be very entrepreneurial. "With these criteria we will 
get good KADIN leadership because I think that any head of KADIN 
who fulfills these criteria will understand the ins and outs of 
the business world," he said.

  [Text] Jakarta, 5 January--Private businessmen have been 
urged to limit seeking foreign loans, because the total amount 
of such debts contracted for up to now is rather large. If this 
process were allowed to continue without limitation, it would 
affect the national "debt service ratio" (DSR) which, at 
present, is 32 percent. 
  Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad made this statement to 
reporters after installing several senior executives in office 
at the Department of Finance in Jakarta on 4 January. 
  Furthermore, he urged private businessmen not to be too 
ambitious in carrying out large, capital intensive projects with 
funds derived from foreign loans. 
  According to Minister of Finance Mar'ie, the size of the 
private foreign debt strongly affects the national "debt service 
ratio" (DSR) which, at present, is 32 percent. About 11 percent 
of this figure consists of debts entered into by private 
business, while the remaining 21 percent consists of government 
debt. 
  According to BUSINESS TIMES, which was published on 3 
January 
by Standard and Poor (SP), a U.S. debt rating company, PT 
[Company Limited] Indah Kiat Pulp &amp; Paper Corporation and PT 
Inti Indorayon Utama, two private Indonesian companies, are on 
the list of companies with the highest debt burden in the 
private sector. The two companies have succeeded in raising $175 
million in commercial paper on the bond market in the United 
States. 
  Mar'ie said that so far the private sector has been too 
dependent on funds obtained from the banks. As a result, in 
their investments their own private capital has been smaller 
than the capital of the State Enterprises Board (BUMN). 
  In this connection, according to Mar'ie, there has been a 
new 
development in terms of finding sources of investment funding. 
That is, the capital market has become active once again. He 
estimates that interest in the capital market, which grew during 
1993 will continue into 1994. The minister of finance gave this 
warning in connection with the prospect for growing indebtedness 
of the private sector in the national development field during 
the upcoming Sixth Five-Year Plan. 
  According to the minister, during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, 
which will begin in April 1994, the private sector will have a 
larger role in national development, compared to previous 
five-year plans. He said: "At present the private sector is 
responsible for about 67 percent of national development 
activity. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan this role will 
increase to at least 75 percent." 
  Furthermore, foreign-owned private firms will also be given 
an opportunity to participate in development projects which are 
presently dominated by the government. 
  As an initial step the government has given the private 
sector an opportunity to participate in the construction of the 
Paiton electricity generating plant. Later on it may become 
possible for the private sector to have a role in the 
construction of major harbors under the "build, operate, 
transfer" (BOT) system. 
<H5>  Changes </H5>
  On this occasion Minister of Finance Mar'ie installed T.L. 
Yousuf in office as a staff adviser to the minister of finance 
in the field of government receipts. Yousuf had previously been 
director of customs in the Directorate General of Customs and 
Excise. Abdul Kadar, who had previously been chief of the 
Jakarta Regional Office of the State Credit and Auctions Board 
(BUPLN), was installed in office as chief of the Bureau of 
Information and Law of BUPLN. Samsul Chorib, who had previously 
been chief of the Medan I Regional Office of BUPLN, became chief 
of the Bureau of State Credit and Banking of BUPLN. 
  Also on this occasion the minister installed in office two 
managing directors and one director of government banks. Towil 
Heryoto and Sjahrizal, who had been managing directors of the 
Bank Tabungan Negara [State Postal Savings Bank] (BTN) and the 
Bank Pembangunan Indonesia [Indonesian Development Bank] 
(BAPINDO), respectively, exchanged positions. Towil became 
managing director of BAPINDO and Sjahrizal became managing 
director of the BTN. Furthermore, Dady Efendi, who had 
previously been manager of the Jakarta branch of the BRI [Bank 
Rakyat Indonesia--Indonesian People's Bank], was installed in 
office as a director of the BRI. 
  According to Minister of Finance Mar'ie, these changes of 
position and the installations in office of managing directors 
and directors of government banks are part of a process of 
consolidation in the banking sector. Mar'ie, a former director 
general of taxes, said: "These individuals have now been 
assigned to more appropriate positions, but this does not mean 
that up to the present they have not been suited to the 
positions they held."

  [Text] Government efforts to improve the welfare of workers 
by raising the present minimum wage have become a national 
commitment. Businesses were warned not to take advantage of the 
weakened position of the workers in order to keep on exploiting 
them. Now is not the time to increase company investment by 
exploiting the workers. These statements were made by three 
members of the DPR-RI [Republic of Indonesia Parliament]: 
Tadjuddin Nursaid (FKP) [Functional Groups Faction], Aberson 
Marle Sihaloho (F-PDI) [Indonesian Democracy Party Faction], and 
Bachtiar Chamsyah (F-PP) [Development Unity Faction], who were 
interviewed separately in Jakarta yesterday. 
  All three urged the government to reject the request made by 
businesses for a temporary postponement of the increase in the 
minimum wage. Abdul Hakim Garuda Nusantara, LSM [Social 
Self-Help Society] activist and Luhut M.P. Pangaribuan, director 
of the Jakarta LBH [Legal Aid Society], expressed the same hope. 
"The government must reject the request made by businesses to 
postpone an increase in the minimum wage," said Luhut 
Pangaribuan. 
  When he appeared at KADIN's [Indonesian Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry] prenational-congress ceremonies yesterday, 
Minister of Manpower Abdul Latief affirmed that the government 
had good reasons for setting a regional minimum wage. They 
arrived at that conclusion after examining the results of a 
survey and investigation carried out by the National Salary 
Research Board (DPPN), which concluded that workers' 
productivity had increased but that their wages had not gone up. 
That is why the minimum wage must be increased. 
  At the same time as the decision to raise the minimum wage 
was reached, strikes by workers in BOTABEK (Bogor, Tangerang, 
Bekasi) continued to flare up. These three industrial regions 
employ hundreds of thousands of workers. 
  In Tangerang at least 1,000 employees of Pratama Abadi 
Industries Inc., which produces Nike and Reebok shoes in the 
village of Pakulonan, held demonstrations yesterday. They asked 
factory owners, who employ 5,000 employees, to raise the minimum 
wage retroactive to 1 January 1994. 
<H5>  Too Low </H5>
  Tadjuddin believes that Indonesian wages are too low at the 
present time. An example is that even though wages in the 
Jakarta DKI [Special Capital District] were raised to 3,800 
rupiahs per day on 1 January, their real value is still too low 
considering that the daily cost of living in the DKI is so high 
and is getting higher. 
  Now is the right time to try to improve wages as we approach 
the Sixth PELITA [Five-Year Development Plan] and the present 
era of industrialization. It turns out that the Fifth 
PELITA--during which the industrial and the nonoil and gas 
sectors produced rather convincing figures--was not or has not 
yet been matched by a satisfactory improvement in wages. "In 
short, up to this point we have not yet noticed the trickle down 
effects of development," he said. 
  Indonesian wages are still based on the KFM (minimum 
physical 
needs) standards, which were formulated about 37 years ago in 
1956. The components used to calculate the KFM have not kept 
pace with present-day developments or needs. For example, the 
KFM only lists a pandanus mat to sleep on, a kerosene lamp for 
illumination, thong sandals for shoes, etc. 
  Ironically, said Tadjuddin, employers only use the KFM 
standard calculations for unmarried workers; but when the 
workers--both male and female--get married, they must provide 
food and other necessities for their spouses and children. 
  This situation must be improved in the Sixth PELITA and 
afterwards. Tadjuddin believes that the APINDO (Indonesian 
Business Association) proposal that the increase in the minimum 
wage be postponed is really an attempt to compensate for their 
inability to face up to the recent pressures of a high-cost 
economy. These high expenses contain various elements, including 
illegal fees, manipulated legal fees, and requests from various 
parties for contributions. 
  For that reason, the basic problem is that all parties 
concerned, including the government, must be aware of and 
eliminate those "obstacles." "If we can accomplish this, 
business will automatically be able to improve and raise wages 
without having to add to the cost of production." 
<H5>  Include the Workers </H5>
  Aberson thinks that companies must increase their assets and 
company investments by including the welfare of the workers. It 
is meaningless if the welfare of the workers does not follow 
from the company's growth and development. 
  "I'm convinced that increasing the welfare of the workers 
will also increase the positive image of the company. But if the 
welfare of the workers is low, the company will also have a 
negative image," said Aberson. 
  Aberson and Bachtiar also called on the government to reject 
business requests for a temporary postponement of the increase 
in the minimum wage of occasional workers. If the government 
does not listen to that plea, the DPR will step in and protect 
the rights of the workers, who they believe have suffered so 
much. 
  As reported, many companies have requested a temporary 
postponement of the increase in the minimum wage which went into 
effect on 1 January 1994. This request for a postponement is 
real since one of the articles in Minister of Manpower SK 
[Directive] Number 461/MEN/1993 points to that possibility. 
  Pangaribuan and Abdul Hakim consider that the inclusion of 
that article shows the government's ambivalence. On the one 
hand, the government wants to raise the minimum wage, but on the 
other hand the government wants to give business the opportunity 
to request a postponement. 
<H5>  Objections Raised </H5>
  Minister of Manpower Abdul Latief himself thinks that the 
objections raised by business to that increase are perfectly 
natural. In their business calculations businesses basically 
always want to make a profit by decreasing their labor costs. 
  There were good reasons for the government to raise the 
minimum wage to 3,800 rupiahs in the DKI Jakarta and in parts of 
West Java. The minister of manpower said that before that 
agreement was enacted as a government directive, the government 
considered various aspects: the industries involved, the growth 
of bank interest rates, field data, productivity analyses, and 
surveys carried out by the Department of Manpower itself. On the 
basis of all these aspects, plus input from business, workers 
and the SPSI [All-Indonesia Workers Association], these 
materials were formulated as a directive. Casting all of these 
materials in the form of a directive did not come about 
suddenly; it had been in preparation for a long time after it 
was noticed that wages had not been going up, but that the 
productivity and export performance of those industries kept on 
increasing. 
  "It is really not true that the various formulations we used 
did not take the needs of business into consideration." For that 
reason, his department, which handles technical matters, is 
willing to listen to the objections raised by those businesses. 
  However, as has been noted, they must be accompanied by good 
reasons, including a clear and detailed analysis of the 
company's cost of production structure. On that basis the 
government will be able to study whether those objections should 
be taken into consideration or whether they are merely fears. 
  "The problem, in my opinion, is that under present 
conditions 
the cost structure of those industries is not fair. To continue 
to defeat the competition they must try to keep wages low 
without reducing other income sectors. The government thinks 
that now is the right time to raise wages," said the minister, 
who is himself a former businessman. 
<H3>  The Atmosphere in JABOTABEK [Jakarta, Bogor, Tangerang, 
Bekasi] </H3>
  At the same time as a decision to raise the minimum wage was 
reached, there have been continual strikes in BOTABEK (Bogor, 
Tangerang, Bekasi). In Tangerang at least 1,000 workers from 
Pratama Abadi Industries Inc, which produces Nike and Reebok 
shoes in the village of Pakulonan, demonstrated yesterday. They 
were asking the plants, which employ 5,000 workers, to raise the 
minimum wage retroactive to 1 January 1994. 
  Those workers believe that the company is on the Tangerang 
Department of Manpower list of companies which submitted a 
request to postpone the wage hike. But after the matter was 
discussed, they learned that their wages had already been raised. 
  Strikes affected a number of industries in Bogor last week. 
Among those hit hardest by a strike is the Chiki snack food 
company in the village of Ciomas. The strike by 500 workers has 
been going on since last Monday [3 January]. 
  After some discussion, the company claimed that it could 
raise the wages of only those workers still earning under 3,800 
rupiahs. But the raise would be postponed for those workers who 
had been working for the company for many years but whose wages 
were above 3,800 rupiahs. This policy did not satisfy those 
workers who had devoted many years to the company. 
  There also were strikes in Bekasi. As in the other areas, 
the 
strikes stemmed from worker anxiety that the companies might be 
allowed to postpone the implementation of the minimum wage 
directive. 
  Amar Syamsura, head of the Department of Manpower in Bekasi, 
admitted that many companies, including a factory which makes 
ready-made clothing, had requested a postponement. "But there's 
no need to worry. We have 60 letters from companies in Bekasi 
about complying with the new KUM (minimum wage directive)," he 
said. 
  The Bekasi Department of Manpower promised to take action 
against those businesses which do not comply with the new 3,800 
rupiah per day KUM. The most extreme action would be to take the 
company to court. 
  KOMPAS noted that when the government raised the minimum 
wage 
in Bekasi last year from 1,600 rupiahs per day to 2,600 rupiahs 
per day, many businesses "juggled" the figures. Temporary 
company subsidies, such as money for food, transportation and 
medical treatment were turned into permanent subsidies, so that 
the workers received a total of 2,600 rupiahs per day. 
  In Bogor the staff of the Department of Manpower in the 
Municipality and District of Bogor said that five companies had 
submitted a request to postpone the implementation of the wage 
hike on grounds that company conditions did not permit it yet. 
In Tangerang at least eight companies submitted the same 
request. The Department of Manpower is unwilling to state the 
names of those companies. But they operate in the following 
industries: rattan, pharmaceuticals, food and drink, and shoes. 
  In the West Jakarta region at least 29 companies are subject 
to strikes; 883 companies are classed as being subject to 
strikes [as published] and 83 are in the stable class. If a 
company does not have a PKB (joint work agreement) or an SPSI 
work-unit steward, it is classified as being subject to strikes.

  [Text] The 1994-1995 State Revenue and Expenditure Budget 
Bill [RAPBN] is set to be balanced at 69.7 trillion rupiahs. 
Although the total is 11.9 percent higher than the present APBN 
[State Revenue and Expenditure Budget], the government will 
achieve some savings by setting development priorities and by 
determining to avoid waste and leaks. To accelerate state 
revenues from the nonoil and gas sectors, the government will 
depend to a greater extent on the contribution of the tax 
sector, which will reach 40.1 trillion rupiahs, or 69 percent of 
total domestic revenues. 
  For that purpose, the government will continue to deregulate 
and debureaucratize in order to eliminate obstacles in the 
national economic system and to mobilize the efficient movement 
of funds. By stabilizing the institutionalization and the 
apparatus of all sectors, the goal of economic growth can be 
accelerated to 6.2 percent per annum. 
  President Suharto made these and other statements when he 
delivered the Financial Memorandum and RAPBN for 1994-1995, the 
first year of the Sixth REPELITA [Five-Year Development Plan], 
to a plenary session of the DPR [Parliament] at the DPR Building 
in Jakarta yesterday. The entire Sixth Development Cabinet and 
ambassadors were present at the session, which was led by 
Wahono, chairman of the DPR/MPR [People's Consultative Assembly]. 
  The president said that this 69.7 trillion rupiah RAPBN 
consists of 59.7 trillion rupiahs in domestic revenues and 10 
trillion rupiahs in development revenues (cashing in foreign 
aid). The revenue projections assume a crude oil price of $16 
per barrel. 
  Routine expenditures will be 42.3 trillion rupiahs and 
development expenditures will be 27.4 trillion rupiahs. The gap 
between domestic revenues and routine expenditures means that 
the government will have savings of 17.4 trillion rupiahs. "This 
means that we will have an increased independent ability to fund 
development," said the president. 
  The rise in the 1994-1995 RAPBN is actually not very 
different from the previous year's rise of 11.1 percent. But, 
the head of state said, in this budget year the government will 
not increase the wages of civil servants and of members of the 
Armed Forces. The government will also not make funds available 
for the construction of new buildings for government departments 
and nondepartmental institutions, either in the capital or in 
the provinces. 
  The routine expense budget has in fact risen by 14.2 percent 
over last year to 42.3 trillion rupiahs, almost half of which is 
used to pay for the cost of the civil service, both in the 
capital and in the provinces. But the rise is just the result of 
last year's average 12-percent rise in civil service and Armed 
Forces salaries and of plans to increase the Armed Forces food 
subsidy from 1,800 to 3,000 rupiahs per person per day. 
<H5>  Provincial Development </H5>
  According to the head of state, most of the development 
budget, 5.5 trillion rupiahs, will be devoted to provincial 
development. Of this, 5.3 trillion rupiahs will be in the form 
of INPRES [Presidential Instruction] funds, consisting of six 
programs: village INPRES, district-level INPRES, 
provincial-level INPRES, underdeveloped village INPRES, 
elementary school INPRES, and health INPRES. 
  Twenty million rupiahs of underdeveloped-village INPRES 
funds 
(IDT) have been set aside for each village; 389 billion rupiahs 
will be spent on this. Village INPRES funds will be increased 
from 5.5 million rupiahs to 6 million rupiahs for each village. 
District-level INPRES funds will be increased by 135 percent to 
2.4 trillion rupiahs, and provincial-level INPRES funds will be 
increased by 55 percent to 1.2 trillion rupiahs. On the other 
hand, elementary school INPRES funds will be decreased by 33 
percent to 497 billion rupiahs, and health INPRES funds will 
stay at 393 billion rupiahs. 
  Beginning with the first year of the Sixth REPELITA, the 
president said, a number of INPRES programs will be simplified 
by giving the provinces greater responsibility. This step is 
intended to develop a provincial autonomy which is more real, 
more compatible, more dynamic and more responsible, by placing 
greater emphasis on the district level. "This shows the great 
trust that we place on the abilities of our provincial 
development apparatus," said the head of state. 
  Other big budget sectors are transportation at 5.2 trillion 
rupiahs, mining and energy at 3.5 trillion rupiahs, education at 
almost 3 trillion rupiahs, and the irrigation sector at 1.7 
trillion rupiahs. 
  Other sectors with budgets over 1 trillion rupiahs, the 
president said, are the defense and security sector at 1.2 
trillion rupiahs and health at over one trillion rupiahs. The 
agricultural sector, which has been separated from irrigation, 
will receive 900 billion rupiahs, followed by the housing and 
residential sector at 888 billion rupiahs. 
  "If other sectors do not receive large amounts of funding, 
it 
does not mean that they have a lower priority. They have low 
budgets because they have different needs from the sectors which 
require large investments," said the head of state. 
  The industrial sector, which the president gave as an 
example, received a relatively small development budget of 450 
billion rupiahs, even though industry is an important sector in 
the Sixth REPELITA. The reason, he continued, is that the 
business world, including the BUMN's [state-owned corporations], 
carry out industrial development. "The government guides and 
fosters it and creates a healthy climate for the growth of 
industry". 
  The president stated that he had instructed his ministers to 
set precise priorities, to increase efficiency, to put a stop to 
waste and leaks, and to motivate their rank and file to work 
more actively and efficiently and to comply with our basic 
philosophy, so as to achieve optimal results. 
  "In particular, I ask you to make sure that what we have 
built up to now--the infrastructures, facilities, production, 
projects, and buildings--are really treated well and cared for 
so that they function in an optimal way. There is no use in 
building something if what we build does not function as it 
should and there is no use in building something new if it is 
neglected over time," said the president firmly. 
<H5>  Taxes Raised </H5>
  The president also said that we must continue to enhance the 
national economy, especially the industrial sector, which we 
depend on not only to provide employment, but which will also 
gradually take over the role of the agricultural sector. But he 
also warned that the agricultural sector will continue to play a 
strategic role and will still be an important means of 
livelihood for a large part of the work force. 
  By stimulating the business world the government hopes that 
domestic revenues can best be gotten from tax revenues. With tax 
revenues of 40.1 trillion rupiahs, or 78.6 percent of total 
domestic revenues, it is hoped that the structure of state 
revenues will be able to face external fluctuations in a firmer 
and more dependable way. 
  Taxes are the key to the success of future development. That 
is why the president asked everyone to be an honorable citizen 
and pay his tax obligations. "I especially direct this request 
to businessmen and to those who are fortunate enough to have 
greater income and assets than other members of society," the 
president added. 
  Besides taxes as the primary contribution to nonoil and gas 
revenues, the government also still depends on development 
revenues of 10 trillion rupiahs. This figure is 4.8 percent 
higher than present development revenues. "This relatively small 
increase indicates the decreasing role of foreign aid and 
development expenditures." 
  In another area, the president stated that economic growth, 
supported by steady economic stability, has stimulated the shift 
of the economic structure towards greater firmness and balance. 
In 1991 the role and contribution of industry surpassed the 
contribution of the agricultural sector--20.8 for the former and 
19.6 percent for the latter. The dependency on petroleum is 
decreasing; in 1992 it contributed only 13 percent to national 
production. This also strengthened the acquisition of foreign 
exchange and state revenues. 
  The development of the national economy is still very 
encouraging in 1993, even though there has been a slow-down in 
several sectors. Steps taken over the past few years to cool 
down the economic engine resulted in macroeconomic stability in 
1993, even though the rate of inflation is still rather high. 
  The president said that the 1993 current transaction deficit 
rose slightly over the previous year. The increase in nonoil and 
gas exports is rather impressive, even though it is not big 
enough to cover the increase in nonoil and gas imports. Foreign 
commercial loans by the private sector and by BUMNs, the head of 
state continued, began to slow down in 1992; on the other hand, 
foreign exchange reserves continued to rise and were sufficient 
to pay for five months of import needs. 
<H5>  Deregulation and Debureaucratization </H5>
  The president admitted that positive economic development 
does not mean that the national economy no longer has any 
problems. "We must continue to guard against increases in the 
current transaction deficit and in the balance of payments. We 
must continue to maintain growth in next year's nonoil and gas 
exports so that the current transaction deficit remains below 2 
percent of the gross national product. 
  "I have asked all my ministers to be cautious and to refrain 
from easily proposing projects with commercial credit costs from 
foreign export credits". 
  The president went on to say, "We must try as hard as 
possible to keep inflation in 1994 lower than in 1993," adding, 
"We must continue to implement cautious fiscal and monetary 
policies. We must safeguard those steps already taken to 
deregulate and debureaucratize," said the president. 
  We must continue to carry out and complete the consolidation 
of the financial and banking sectors, including improvements in 
the system for examining banks and financial institutions so as 
to avoid any difficulties. We must gradually overcome any 
obstacles to the physical infrastructure, such as electricity, 
ports, roads and telecommunications, so that they do not 
obstruct economic growth. 
  In the uncertain economic conditions of today's world, the 
president said, increasing exports will face serious 
constraints. The growth of economic blocs, the existence of 
various political issues connected to trade and economic 
cooperation, and the rise of new competitor nations can have an 
effect on increasing exports. 
  "With the enactment of the GATT agreement of 1994, obstacles 
to world trade have decreased and this has given us the 
opportunity to increase exports on the international market. But 
the consequences are that the domestic market is also opening up 
and is facing competition. There is no other way; we must 
increase our ability to compete in the export market and to 
compete in the domestic market," said the president. 
<H5>  Wahono's Introduction </H5>
  Meanwhile, Chairman of the DPR RI Wahono opened the session 
by saying that the DPR will always exercise political oversight 
over various government policies, supported by the results 
obtained from the Financial Auditing Board. This is an effort to 
help the president, in line with what he conveyed in his 
inauguration speech of March 1993, which hoped for the support, 
correction, and oversight of the DPR. 
  "The Parliament is ready to form a Sixth REPELITA Special 
Committee, which will carry out a detailed, sector-by-sector 
examination of the economy, with the hope that responsibility 
will lie with the Sixth REPELITA, which spells out the 1993 GBHN 
[Main Outlines of National Direction]," he said. 
  Wahono said that the Parliament hopes that various policies, 
such as those spelled out in the GBHN and its implementation, 
will really be supported by the ability, good will, hard work, 
and a high degree of discipline of the government bureaucracy. 
  To match all of this he invited all members of the 
Parliament 
to carry out their tasks with greater quality and seriousness in 
the areas of legislation, determining the APBN and in their 
oversight tasks. 
  Wahono also emphasized that President Suharto has achieved 
success after success in his efforts to play a more active role 
in various international forums, both as the head of state of 
the Republic of Indonesia and as the head of the Nonaligned 
Movement, which has the role of voicing the interests of the 
nonaligned nations. 
  The Parliament hopes that the progress achieved in 
international forums can be maintained and increased by trying 
to work on the domestic conditions which support it, such as the 
implementation of PANCASILA [Five Principles of the Nation] 
Democracy, by improving human rights and by handling 
environmental problems.

  [Text] Jakarta, 7 January (Antara)--The reduction in the 
export tax, intended by the government to stimulate initiative 
in the business world, will not guarantee an increase in 
Indonesian export volume, in the view of several commentators. 
  This view was expressed by Kwik Kian Gie, an economic 
observer; Tadjoeddin Noersaid, a member of Committee VI of 
Parliament; and Fadel Muhamad, a businessman. They were 
commenting on the reduction of the export tax, as mentioned in 
the speech of President Suharto on 6 January regarding "Economic 
Notes" and the RAPBN [Draft State Budget] for fiscal year 
1994/1995 before members of Parliament in Jakarta. 
  In the draft state budget (RAPBN) for fiscal year 1994/1995 
which was submitted by the president to Parliament, it is 
estimated that government income from the export tax will amount 
to only 16.4 billion rupiahs, or 45.3 percent less than it was 
in the state budget for fiscal year 1993/1994, when it amounted 
to 30 billion rupiahs. 
  According to Kwik Kian Gie, the increase in the volume of 
exports was influenced by several considerations, most of which 
involved the needs of producers for infrastructure to turn out 
goods. 
  He said: "The availability of adequate infrastructure is 
more 
important than a reduction in the export tax because it directly 
influences industrial efficiency." 
  A similar view was also expressed by Fadel Muhamad. He said 
that without the infrastructure needed by businessmen to hold 
down production costs, it would be difficult for them to 
penetrate the international market which, at the present time, 
demands high competitive ability. 
  He declared: "If I were asked about the impact of a lower 
export tax, I would say that there will be an increase in 
exports, but it will be very small. The reduction in the export 
tax is a small consideration among the factors required by the 
business world." 
  Tadjoeddin, a member of Committee VI representing the 
Functional Development Faction (FKP), considered that if the 
reduction in the export tax is intended to increase export 
volume, the government will not get the results it hopes for. 
  He said: "What is more directly needed by businessmen is 
easing the regulations on productive activity. The reduction in 
the export tax is something which will not have much of an 
influence on the present situation." 
  Therefore, he said, if a businessman says that he would be 
able to increase export volume if his need for infrastructure is 
met, the government should place greater emphasis on efforts to 
build such infrastructure. 
<H5>  Without Protection </H5>
  Both Kwik, as well as Fadel and Tadjoeddin, agreed that if 
the government wants to increase export volume, which surely 
will require a high level of product competitiveness, all 
existing forms of protectionism should be abolished. 
  Kwik said: "The business world must be taught how to carry 
on 
its business without protection, because protection, as it has 
been provided up to now in a number of industrial sectors, in 
fact only makes the business world more dependent on the 
government." 
  He added that such protection ensures that Indonesian 
domestic industry never grows up and never wants to try to grow 
up. 
  He stated: "This is a not a good sign for economic growth." 
  According to Tadjoeddin, although there is general agreement 
on tariffs, and newly established business firms will operate 
effectively for several years more, the government by now should 
have anticipated developments with greater imagination, 
particularly in preparing the business world "to function on its 
own," rather than "to be guided" by the government. 
  Tadjoeddin declared: "If businessmen are able to compete 
internationally, export volume will also increase automatically, 
because in an indirect way, demand for Indonesian products will 
also increase." 
<H5>  Sukamdani </H5>
  Meanwhile, Sukamdani S. Gitosarjono, chairman of the Board 
of 
Directors of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
(KADIN), said that the tax receipts target of 42.6 trillion 
rupiahs in the state budget for fiscal year 1994/1995 is too 
ambitious because at the present time a climate conducive for 
stimulating an increase in taxes has not been properly created. 
  Sukamdani said: "This large a target can only be achieved if 
the government is able to create a climate which is conducive to 
business activity." He was answering questions from reporters 
after attending the ceremony in Jakarta on 6 January at which 
the president spoke on "Economic Notes" and the draft budget for 
fiscal year 1994/1995. 
  According to Sukamdani, the question is not the ability or 
inability of the government to reach this target, but, rather, 
how the government can create conditions to encourage private 
businessmen as the agents of development to provide support for 
large taxes. 
  He said: "Previously, the government was the agent of 
development, and the private sector was only a participant in 
the process. However, now the government hopes that the private 
sector will be able to provide 73 percent of the target of 600 
trillion rupiahs to be invested during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. 
This means that the private sector has a major role." 
  Sukamdani hoped that the government, as well as KADIN, will 
serve as the engine of the business world in the effort to make 
a success of planned programs. 
  He did not think that an increase of 9.0 trillion rupiahs in 
the non-oil and gas sector, from 37,641 trillion rupiahs in 
fiscal year 1993/1994 to 46,886 trillion rupiahs in fiscal year 
1994/1995, is too fanciful. 
  He stated: "I think that this increase is appropriate 
because 
our manufacturing sector is sufficiently developed, and there 
will always be further expansion of production. Moreover, the 
quotas for developed countries have been watered down since the 
negotiation of the original GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade) agreement. Now it remains to be seen how courageous 
we are in taking advantage of our opportunities." 
  According to Sukamdani, the most important thing for 
Indonesia to do is to have a sort of company called "Indonesia 
Incorporated," as was once proposed by Arifin Siregar. That is, 
pressure for cooperation between the government and the business 
world. 
  He said: "Then the government will only act as policymaker 
and facilitator, while the business world functions as the 
economic agent or implementer."

  [Text] Jakarta, 8 January--The Functional Development 
Faction (FKP) in Parliament will continue to be consistent in 
respecting President Suharto's instructions that waste and graft 
should be avoided in implementing the budget. At the same time 
tax collections need to be raised steadily to increase total 
state tax receipts, while ensuring that the activities of tax 
collectors are more professional. 
  This statement was made by Dr. Usman Hasan, chairman of the 
FKP, in answer to questions from a SUARA PEMBARUAN 
representative at the Parliament building in the Senayan section 
of Jakarta. He was talking about the speech by the president to 
a plenary session of Parliament on 6 January. 
  A similar view was expressed by Dr. A.A. Oka Mahendra, also 
a 
member of the FKP, who emphasized the president's call on all 
members of the community to pay their taxes. He said that this 
call must also be followed up by increasing the level of 
motivation among the people. In this way state receipts from 
taxes will continue to increase in the coming years. He said: 
"Furthermore, tax revenues must truly be used for clear, 
developmental objectives." 
  According to Usman Hasan, who spoke of the need to prevent 
budgetary waste and corruption, we all hope that this will be 
done. There is a question as to whether graft in the development 
field takes place because of technical or organizational 
management factors. He added that the FKP, in its meetings with 
government officials, will continue to raise the question of 
waste. 
  He said later that since the First Five-Year Plan was begun 
the government has continued to emphasize increasing income from 
taxes. During this period of time tax collections have always 
met their goals. He stated: "That is, tax income has continued 
to increase almost every year. As a result, I am optimistic that 
the tax collection goal in the next RAPBN [state budget] will be 
achieved and may even be exceeded." 
  According to Usman, although it is generally known that the 
tax collection target has been achieved, it is still necessary 
to make preparations now to achieve the target for state tax 
receipts, that is, by steadily collecting taxes. He added: "This 
is particularly the case if we recall that the percentage of 
persons actually paying their taxes is low, compared to the 
other countries of ASEAN." 
  Regarding the steady collection of taxes, the FKP will 
always 
remind the government to apply the tax regulations firmly. It is 
only right that those able to pay more taxes have a greater 
obligation than those who are not in this position. Steady tax 
collections are also in the interests of justice, apart from the 
consideration of the principles of conflicting subsidies. 
<H5>  Broadening the Tax Base </H5>
  Meanwhile, Dr. Oka Mahendra, a member of the FKP, said that 
the government needs to collect taxes on a more extensive basis. 
Expanding the number of persons who are obliged to pay taxes 
will help the process of tax collection. However, the key to 
success in all of this is the tax collector. 
  Oka admitted that there is an impression among some people 
that a rather large number of potential taxpayers who avoid 
paying taxes come from the ranks of the tax collectors. He 
added: "Therefore, by continuing to stress motivation it is 
hoped that the people's awareness that they have an obligation 
to pay taxes will continue to increase. This includes reporting 
those who have an obligation to pay taxes but who avoid it 
because they are tax collectors." 
  Regarding the need for criminal penalties for those who have 
an obligation to pay taxes but avoid doing so, Oka Mahendra, a 
member of Committee II of Parliament, thought this is not yet 
needed. He said: "However, if there really are people who have 
been involved in avoiding their tax obligations, they should 
face criminal penalties under the laws already in effect." 
<H5>  Question of Salaries </H5>
  Meanwhile, T.B. Silalahi, minister of state for 
administrative reform, stated, in answer to questions from 
reporters, that if the salaries of state employees are not 
increased and the matter of service to the public is left to the 
personal integrity of the individual, who will feel an 
obligation to serve the people? However, although there have 
really been people who have engaged in avoiding payment of their 
taxes, we should not generalize too much in this regard, because 
many employees can also observed in the areas where they work 
who really serve the people. 
  After attending a plenary session of Parliament to hear the 
speech made by the president on 6 January on "Economic Notes" 
and the state budget for fiscal year 1994/1995, Silalahi said: 
"We should not look only at the questions of the service of 
state employees and their salaries, because this matter must be 
considered from a national point of view. At present, whatever 
we think of it, development is now going on at an extraordinary 
pace. Per capita income has been increasing for the past 25 
years." 
  He stated that in a national sense our country is not yet 
able to pay adequate salaries to state employees. If this is the 
situation at the national level, we must think about it. If we 
compare the situation in 1965, when we began the First Five-Year 
Plan, with today, present conditions are far better. He said: 
"We hope that later, by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, 
annual income will increase to $1,000 per capita. However, 
although the salaries of state employees have not increased, the 
government has continued to raise their level of welfare. For 
example, he said, in the most remote provinces the total incomes 
of state employees such as teachers are now twice their 
salaries. As a result, they can serve the people more 
effectively."

Article Type:CSO 

  [Excerpt] It began on 30 December 1993 when the Japanese 
company NewJec submitted reports on a feasibility study and on 
initial construction site data related to a nuclear electric 
power plant [PLTN] to Djali Ahimsa, director general of the 
National Atomic Energy Agency [BATAN]. 
  The consultant to Indonesia on PLTN construction concluded 
that economically a medium-sized PLTN would be very competitive 
and could be operational in the Java-Bali electric power network 
beginning in 2004. Of the three prospective sites on the Muria 
Peninsula of central Java, Cape Lemahabang would best 
accommodate a 7,000-megawatt PLTN, followed by Cape Grenggengan 
and Cape Watu. 
  "I am confident that NewJec's recommendation will receive 
support from the government in its subsequent consideration of 
building a PLTN in Indonesia," Djali said when the reports were 
submitted. 
  Djali also said that the government's approval is sufficient 
for this PLTN construction. Japan and Britain did not involve 
their parliaments, either. "NewJec's recommendation also did not 
state a need for opinion from the Indonesian public," he said. 
  KOMPAS contacted several prominent community figures to ask 
their positions on the building of this PLTN. 
  Abdurrahman Wahid, nicknamed Gus Dur, chairman of 
the NU [Muslim Scholars League: 
  Are you referring to the plan to build a PLTN in the Muria 
Peninsula area of central Java? 
  Muria, like the northern coastal area of the island of Java, 
from Karawang to Cirebon, to Kendal, to the eastern end of the 
island, and to Madura, is NU's base. I have an interest in 
taking part in discussion. If there should be an accident, NU 
members would be affected. 
  From the beginning I have stressed that the risk of nuclear 
accident must be calculated before construction. Do not make 
just an abstract study: The mountain is safe, and such things. 
It must be concrete with quantitative data. 
  To be 100-percent convincing, the risk of nuclear accident 
must be seriously calculated. There must be "full proof." Not 
even a hair's breadth can be missing. The Muria area is 
surrounded by water. There are mountains. The area is in danger 
of earthquakes. 
  The arguments of the government and officials on the urgency 
of building a PLTN have not yet convinced me. The urgency is not 
yet great. 
  Therefore, the government must consider a "public hearing." 
To say that government approval is sufficient for building a 
PLTN is arrogance and conceit on the part of bureaucrats. One 
group that absolutely should be heard from is environment 
lovers. They have "concerns" and have studied the PLTN. 
  The government must bear humanitarian responsibility if an 
accident should occur, because the decision to build a PLTN is a 
political decision. I recommend that considerations should be 
based on caution. The NU always uses caution as a basis for its 
considerations. 
  Let me give an example. If a judge has a little doubt about 
the death penalty, he must give jail punishment instead. 
  In the case of building a PLTN, if there is still a little 
question about danger to people, construction of the PLTN must 
be canceled. Anyway, without a PLTN, Indonesia is not going to 
be 100 years behind. 
  What will I do now? I am still studying the matter. The 
pouring of concrete is still a long way off. If construction 
takes place, I want to hold a fast there before concrete pouring 
is started. Muria is one of the NU's bases. I have an interest 
there. 
  Y.B. Mangunwijaya, Catholic priest and cultural 
expert: 
  The building of a PLTN in Indonesia cannot be viewed as good 
or bad, feasible or unfeasible, scientific or unscientific. The 
PLTN is a project that will be developed because of prestige and 
power. Therefore, looking at it and commenting on it must be 
through political glasses. 
  In this case, I cannot comment as to power or prestige 
outside my area. I cannot take part in stating approval or 
disapproval of the construction of this PLTN. I am merely a 
member of the general public without any power. 
  Furthermore, if we are talking about power, a community 
structure does not exist. The one with the right to speak is the 
"power owner," who will manage and maintain it and who possesses 
power. I do not have any voice. 
  Because PLTN construction is a matter of power, the result 
of 
the feasibility study is certain to be "feasible." In fact, even 
before it was made, the study was already "feasible." The 
feasibility study was needed only for seeking credit and funds 
for building and financing it, and so on. 
  Mochtar Lubis, reporter and cultural expert: 
  The construction of the PLTN must be left to the people or 
to 
the DPR [Parliament], which represents them. Nuclear technology 
is very dangerous. It is not appropriate for merely one minister 
to decide on the building of a PLTN for a nation. Djali Ahimsa's 
answer and attitude demonstrates the arrogance of power, as 
though he knows best what this nation needs. 
  I am anti-PLTN 200 percent, in fact, 1,000 percent. There is 
no further doubt about its danger. 
  From the aspect of culture, I do not believe that the 
technological discipline of Indonesians is sufficient for 
handling PLTN technology. There is still human negligence even 
in France, the United States, and Russia, where there is 
discipline. I also do not believe Indonesians are able to handle 
modern technology. What I know is that Indonesian engineers can 
only connect cables and wires. 
  I recommend that the people be the ones to decide the need, 
or lack of it, for PLTN construction. This should be done 
through a referendum. Whether the people approve or not is up to 
them. 
  Aburizal Bakrie, businessman, president 
commissioner of the Bakrie Group: 
  I have two contradictory views in reaction to the building 
of 
a PLTN. As general chairman of the Indonesian Association of 
Engineers, I agree. Nuclear power is a clean technology, and we 
have mastered the technology. The price, too, is reasonable. 
  However, my question is, for what are we going to use the 
large coal assets in Kalimantan? 
  As a businessman, I naturally prefer coal-fired PLTU's 
[steam-powered electric power plants]. The point is, I have a 
coal mining business. Ha, ha, ha. 
  There are other concerns as to PLTN operation. The cheap 
electricity will interest industrialized countries in relocating 
their industries to Indonesia. Those industries that will be 
relocated reportedly will be those that pollute the environment. 
That can be overcome by environmental protection, however. 
  Environmental protection can also be applied to coal-fired 
PLTU's. Why, then, not do it to coal-fired PLTU's? Besides being 
an abundant natural resource, it is readily available and does 
not need to be imported. 
  Kwik Kian Gie, a director of the PDI [Indonesian 
Democratic Party] DPP [Central Executive Council]: 
  "I have delegated discussion of the PLTN to Kwik. He 
represents me, as well as the PDI DPP," PDI DPP General Director 
Megawati Sukarnoputri told KOMPAS. 
  Therefore, Kwik was the one to respond. 
  With regard to the PLTN, the PDI DPP focuses attention on 
its 
safety. I am very doubtful. Just look at the case of the 
Cernobyl disaster. 
  There has never been a detailed and open explanation about 
PLTN technical questions or economic aspects, either. Therefore, 
I am not able to make much comment. I can only express opinion 
as to the danger. 
  Hamzah Haz, chairman of the DPR FPP [Development 
Unity Faction]: 
  Is the PLTN to be built by 2004? Not feasible. The current 
account deficit and the national balance of payments are in a 
serious condition because development still depends on foreign 
loans. Also, our exports are not yet as we had hoped, 
particularly considering that our annual export growth target 
has to be about 18 percent. 
  Although the condition of the APBN [National Budget] is 
improving, it will not change significantly by the year 2004. 
The PLTN can be classified as a "megaproject" requiring large 
funding from overseas. Do we want to repeat the action of 
cutting off half-completed megaprojects through tight-money 
policies in order to improve the APBN? 
  If the government proceeds with its intention to build a 
PLTN 
megaproject, it should reestimate the prospects for national 
industry through the end of REPELITA VI [Sixth Five-Year 
Development Plan]. Will industry continue to expand and be all 
the more competitive, or not? Will construction of the PLTN have 
a direct impact on investment and our non-oil-and-gas exports, 
or not? If the answer is yes, the DPR perhaps should restudy the 
possibilities for construction. 
  The decision to build a PLTN installation or not should be 
based on technoeconomic calculations and the desires of the 
people. The government should not make the people an "object" of 
development. Although it may be technoeconomically feasible to 
build PLTN, if the people then feel that it will interfere with 
social and environmental security, the project should merely be 
canceled. 
  Krissantono, member of DPR Commission I from the 
FKP [Functional Group Faction]: 
  From the aspect of financing as well as future consequences, 
the PLTN is a megaproject. Politically, several projects that 
were built in the public interest still have a negative impact. 
Examples are Kedungombo and Nipah. 
  In such cases, the victim is always the community around the 
project. They become "objects" of development, despite the fact 
that the GBHN [Broad Outline of State Policy] clearly states 
that the Indonesian people must be the "subject" of development 
and not the "object." 
  Cases like Kedungombo and Nipah must not be repeated. 
  It is my understanding that the GBHN states that the people 
are the main players in development and the government merely 
encourages from the rear. What confuses me is that the statement 
by the BATAN director general is contradictory to the intent of 
the GBHN. The role of the people as the principal player in 
development is not seen in his statement, because the government 
wants to be in front. If that is the case, truth is only as seen 
through the glasses of the government. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Boualapha Thindoi: "The Campaign in Which the </F>
Enemy First Used B-52's in Laos"] 
  [Text] Although the Redeem Honor campaign took place 20 
years ago, nevertheless the fear which this campaign inspired in 
those who experienced it as well as those who were adversely 
affected by the war, such as the people of Xieng Khouang 
Province, will be difficult to forget because everything about 
it was very destructive. It brought disaster to the people of 
Xieng Khouang as never before in history. 
  The name of the campaign, "Redeem Honor," does not indicate 
how violent and fierce it was. We might think that the meaning 
of "redeem honor" was that the imperialists and their lackeys 
would concentrate all their forces to redeem their honor and 
dignity. In fact this campaign came about after the imperialist 
invaders and their subordinates suffered a major defeat in the 
"O-D-N" solidarity campaign and other campaigns in Xieng Khouang 
Province and throughout the liberated areas. They assembled all 
their forces, including modern weapons, and poured them into the 
area of the Plain of Jars on a large scale. They hoped to redeem 
themselves from their defeats. They used more than 50 
battalions, including mercenary soldiers from other countries 
which they assembled to wage war. These forces received air 
support from the imperialists who flew no less than 300 sorties 
per day and some days up to 500 sorties. They brutally poured 
bombs on the Plain of Jars in Xieng Khouang. It was in this 
campaign that they first used strategic B-52 bombers to destroy 
the liberated areas of Laos and that they first applied the 
strategic military theory of their leadership in Laos. This made 
the "Redeem Honor" campaign one of the most fierce, 
life-or-death struggles between the revolutionary forces and the 
enemy in the almost 30-year history of the resistance against 
invasion. They used the scheme of total destruction in hopes of 
making the Plain of Jars in Xieng Khouang a white zone [area 
with no Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP) presence] and 
seizing this strategic area. They used all types of aircraft to 
drop time-delay bombs, cluster bombs, napalm etc. in conjunction 
with artillery in support of a large-scale attack by ground 
forces to clear the area. They used aircraft to drop soldiers to 
seize the important high areas by threat and encirclement. They 
used aircraft equiped with loudspeakers to broadcast propaganda 
from the air to threaten the people and revolutionary forces and 
make them surrender. 
  This destructive war brought great losses to the people of 
Xieng Khouang. In addition to the loss of life and property, 
many thousands of the people of Xieng Khouang suffered the 
misfortune of being forced to flee from their home villages and 
become refugees living in areas under enemy control. This left 
Xieng Khouang an overgrown, abandoned place where it was 
difficult to find a house standing. 
  Nevertheless in this campaign the imperialists and their 
lackeys were not able to redeem themselves from their defeats. 
The patriotic forces and the people of Xieng Khouang, because of 
their patriotism and in order to redeem the honor of Laos, were 
brave and willing to sacrifice lives for their beloved 
fatherland. They counterattacked fiercely and kept advancing. 
From the beginning of August 1969 to 10 February 1970 the 
attacks of the patriotic forces and the people of Xieng Khouang 
grew steadily fiercer so that the enemy was cornered and his 
forces were destroyed. During just 13 days and nights at the end 
of this campaign the armed forces and the people of Xieng 
Khouang put 7,000 of the enemy out of action, took almost 1,000 
who surrendered, and seized and destroyed more than 2,000 
weapons. Of these 25 were artillery pieces. They seized and 
destroyed 70 vehicles. They shot down and destroyed a number of 
aircraft. They seized and destroyed more than 100 [radio] 
telegraphs. This campaign ended on 22 February 1970. In total 
the enemy lost 6,246 of its forces who were killed, captured or 
who surrendered. More than 1,000 deserted, and 2,723 of various 
sorts of weapons were seized and destroyed. They seized and 
destroyed 121 military vehicles and shot down and destroyed a 
number of aircraft. They took back the Plain of Jars in Xieng 
Khouang completely. As a result the "Redeem Honor" campaign of 
the imperialist invaders was another shameful disgrace.

<F P=106> [Article by Kamal Ahmad: "Air Force Structure To Be </F>
Reorganized"] 
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 4 January--On 4 January 
the Ministry of Defense ordered the structure of the Tentera 
Udara Diraja Malaysia (TUDM) [Royal Malaysian Air Force] to be 
reorganized to be more flexible and to allow every individual 
member to assume greater responsibility. 
  Minister of Defense Najib bin Tun Razak said that the 
reorganization also has the objective of ensuring better 
management of the organization at every level in the force. 
  He said that with the changes in the organizational 
structure 
of the Air Force one person will be responsible if an error is 
made. 
  He told a press conference in Kuala Lumpur on 4 January: "An 
investigation made by the Inspectorate of the Royal Malaysian 
Air Force has brought out the fact that there is no single body 
in the organization which is responsible for collecting, 
analyzing, and assessing the most recent data and information 
regarding aircraft and aircraft components. 
  "The procurement of spare parts is based on information on 
stores obtained when the aircraft is purchased and has not been 
available for a long time." 
  According to the minister, the reorganization is based on a 
number of weaknesses that became apparent and that were 
identified by the chief of the Royal Malaysian Air Force 
Inspectorate during the investigation of the Super Puma 
helicopter accident at Sungai Petani on 31 December, which took 
the lives of four members of the Air Force. 
  The minister said that the accident was a serious misfortune 
for the seven aircraft which the Royal Malaysian Air Force 
purchased in 1993. 
  He said: "The initial investigation of the accident was 
concerned with the cover of the gear box which was separated 
from the aircraft. 
  "Based on evidence obtained so far, the Royal Malaysian Air 
Force has rejected the possibility of human error as the direct 
cause of the accident. However, the investigation is still going 
on." 
  Najib said that the logistics control system of the Royal 
Malaysian Air Force is still essentially done by hand, and there 
is no system for checking on the more than 200,000 items of 
equipment presently managed by the logistics section. 
  According to the minister, he will review the latest report 
to the cabinet concerning the Super Puma accident to determine 
the cause of the accident and the steps for the Royal Malaysian 
Air Force to take to prevent such an accident from being 
repeated. 
  He said that the investigation is concentrated on two 
aspects. That is, the direct cause of the accident which is 
being investigated by Air Force inspectors and a review and 
consideration of procedures for handling, controlling and 
administering the helicopter unit. 
  The task of investigation is being assisted by foreign 
experts, including the makers of the aircraft, Industri Pesawat 
Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) [Nusantara Aircraft Industry] of 
Indonesia, and Eurocopter of France, a company that designs 
helicopters. 
  The investigation of the accident is still going on, and 
portions of the aircraft which have been found have been 
delivered to the Defense Science Research Center in Kuala Lumpur. 
  Asked whether the report on the accident will be made 
public, 
Najib said that that depended on a decision by the government. 
  Answering a question regarding the possibility that the 
purchase of the Super Puma helicopters was influenced by 
political pressures, Najib said: "I do not know. What we can see 
is that there was nothing wrong in our decision to buy the Super 
Puma, and there is no evidence indicating that this decision was 
unwise." 
  Regarding a government commitment to buy two more Super Puma 
helicopters, he said that the Royal Malaysian Air Force has no 
plans to do that. 
  Asked about the possibility that the government is reviewing 
its original decision to purchase CN2353 aircraft made by IPTN 
to replace Caribou aircraft, Najib said: "For any purchase made 
from whatever source we must be sure that the item concerned 
meets the standards of quality and cost established by the Royal 
Malaysian Air Force. 
  "In the future any purchase of equipment will be required to 
satisfy these aspects. I do not reject the possibility that we 
will buy another aircraft from IPTN, provided the company meets 
our needs." 
  Najib also said that the government has not yet made a 
decision on a commitment to purchase several transport and 
helicopter aircraft from Indonesia. He said: "We have not yet 
made a decision. However, discussions are still going on."

  [Text] At long last, the lengthy debate over the national 
budget has ended thanks to the hard work of the senators and 
congressmen. Mr. Ople clearly detailed the heated and dramatic 
exchanges over the national budget in his long article about it 
in the Bulletin. 
  The hard work of Mr. De Venecia, the Speaker of the House, 
on 
the budget debates deserves high praise. And his team of 
legislators hardly had any sleep during the debates on the 
budget bill while they were working on their respective 
assignments. At the top of the list are the two seasoned 
lawmakers, Rony Zamora and Mr. Raul Daza, of the Liberal Party. 
  Likewise, on the Senate side, a lot can be said about the 
leadership qualities of Mr. Ed Angara, the President of the 
Senate. Neither did the senators have any sleep during the past 
week. Maceda and Ople are the most conscientious of all. Not 
far behind those two are F. Tatad, Tito Sotto, and Mr. Boy 
Herrera, who despite all obstacles, did not cease scrutinizing 
and commenting on the budget. So also with the four female 
senators, S. Rasul, L. Shahani, Gloria Macapagal and Coseteng, 
all active in studying, questioning and streamlining the 
national budget. 
  It seems that there were no lazy legislators in the House 
and 
the Senate. Everyone was hard at work. Thus, there will be no 
resentment during the upcoming long vacation of the legislature. 
  The controversial CDF (Countryside Development Fund) was 
also 
included in the budget. The decision-making powers of President 
Ramos have increased concerning what is dear to him. The 
President now has the authority to utilize this fund wherever or 
whenever there is calamity, destruction, or extreme deprivation 
in society. 
  Apparently the legislature has full confidence in Mr. Ramos 
and deservedly so. Ramos does not convey the image of a man 
desirous of acquisitions. And this image must not be ruined 
even if he prefers to be surrounded by people eager to wheel and 
deal. 
  Of all the provisions in the budget, the countryside funds 
are the most important. It is a new concept that can help 
considerably in improving the economy in the provinces. There 
are some people who believe that it should be plainly labelled 
`pork-barrel.' In areas where the fund is wisely spent, the 
residents are pleased. They view the government as caring and 
loving. Feeder roads, schoolhouses, Artesian wells...These are 
some of the things that can be funded by the CDF. 
  Without this (i.e., the CDF), our senators and congressmen 
are just like mannequins. They will simply have to wait on the 
good graces of the President or of the Cabinet members. And 
many of the Cabinet members have one qualification for office: 
Arrogance. 
  The education budget is barely adequate. It should have been 
much bigger; however, there are still other priorities. The 
national budget is huge; hence, Vizons-Chato, Parayno, and 
whoever becomes the `Pagcor', must expedite tax collection for 
the country's needs. And those of you who are economically 
well-off, do pay your taxes for our future's sake.

  [Text] Yesterday President Ramos ordered the Department of 
Budget and Management to proceed, effective 1 January 1994, with 
the first part of a three-year program to raise the salaries of 
the military, the police, the fire departments, and the prison 
wardens, including the cadets. The order was announced by the 
president in his address at the 58th AFP Day Celebration at Camp 
Aguinaldo. 
  According to the chief executive, the sums necessary for the 
salary hikes, estimated at 3.2 billion pesos for the uniformed 
personnel of the Armed Forces, the Philippine National Police, 
and others in uniformed service in the Department of the 
Interior and in local government, are already available from the 
Compensation Adjustment Fund and from other fund sources 
authorized in the 1994 budget. 
  The president also made clear that the national government's 
civilian workers can also expect new adjustments in their 
allowances, effective 1994, while a new salary standardization 
bill is pending in Congress, and is being consolidated and 
streamlined. 
  Yesterday President Ramos also presented a feasibility study 
on the development of a new international passenger terminal at 
the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA). 
  The proposed $400 million master development plan prepared 
by 
Singapore Changi Airport Enterprise under a contract with Asia's 
Emerging Dragon Corporation, outlines the necessity of immediate 
construction of a new terminal, in the fastest possible manner, 
in order to accommodate the expected huge increase in the number 
of passengers at NAIA. 
  The development strategy is to build an initial facility for 
24 aircraft stands and for 32 later stands in order to 
accommodate the passenger demand of up to 10 million people 
forecast for the year 2003, and of up to 15 million for the year 
2010.

  [Editorial Report] The 16 January Manila BALITA in Tagalog 
on page 2 reports that Interior Secretary Rafael Alunan has 
proposed legalizing the clandestine gun-making industry to curb 
the spread of unlicensed guns, and at the same time earn dollars 
from weapons exports to Asian countries. Alunan said that as a 
first step toward legalization, unlicensed gunsmiths in central 
Danao city, the country's gun-manufacturing center, could form a 
cooperative. BALITA reports that efforts to quash the industry 
have failed, partly because the gunsmiths are protected by some 
politicians. 
  The paper also reports that Danao gunsmiths, formerly 
farmers, produce thousands of guns every year, and these guns 
find their way into the hands of criminal gangs in Japan and 
Taiwan. The guns include revolvers, shotguns, and pistols that 
sell for $25 to $290.

<F P=106> [Article by Lieutenant Colonel Luong Xuan Ba: "Organizing </F>
Militia, Self-Defense Forces Under Conditions of Multisectoral 
Economy"] 
  [Text] As we know, production is always linked with market 
and has its own laws. National defense as a field of activity 
and organizing and building the armed forces also have their own 
laws. These laws are (relatively) independent from one another, 
but they are closely interrelated--production always being 
closely linked with protection of the production of different 
installations and localities, as well as of the country as a 
whole. "Building the country is closely linked with defending 
the country" and "building socialism must be closely linked with 
protecting socialism." These are the necessary laws. 
  The militia and self-defense forces (MSF) are the armed 
forces of the masses and are closely linked with production, 
social life, and political movement at the basic level. At 
present, the new production mechanism directly and regularly 
acts on the MSF in many ways: 
  -- The laws on value, competition, and regulation of 
production act on them. 
  During the time when state subsidies still existed, Military 
Region 5, like other localities, had organized its MSF mainly on 
the basis of the collective state-operated production. The 
implementation of Resolution 10 of the Political Bureau in 
agriculture and Decree 217 of the Council of Ministers calling 
for abolishing state subsidies, granting autonomy to production 
installations, practicing profit-and-loss accounting, and 
working with an adjusted market mechanism had created a fierce 
challenge for two-thirds of state enterprises, namely, 90-95 
percent of enterprises at district and city levels being forced 
to dissolve, the scope and authorities of agricultural 
cooperatives being reduced, and production units no longer 
exerting any influence. From 90 to 95 percent of fishery 
cooperatives had gone bankrupt and had been dissolved. 
  Private production, in the meantime, had been developing in 
many forms: Private enterprises put their capital together 
through the sales of shares; joint enterprises, through 
cooperation with the outside world, attracted most of the work 
force. 
  The common tendency in production organization today is to 
lighten the administrative management machinery and to reduce 
the number of nonproductive intermediary layers. In 
state-operated enterprises, contracts are signed with shops, 
shifts, and groups, and on the basis of various means of 
production. In agriculture, contracts are signed on the basis of 
unit prices and with individual workers, with households being 
considered autonomous economic units in production. 
  The common form is to organize appropriately small and 
flexible enterprises in accordance with the market mechanism, 
with the fact that workers have no job security due to their 
contractual status, and so on. This is a great difficulty in the 
organization and management of the MSF. 
  Many illogical aspects and irreparable discrepancies between 
the interests and obligation of citizens and production units 
have appeared in the system of procedures and policies 
applicable to the MSF and reserve troops that was adopted to 
guarantee their training and activities. There are policies and 
regulations that are no longer effectively usable. Sectors and 
echelons, both central and local, and production installations, 
production units, and citizens have not yet properly resolved 
the relationships between the two strategic tasks of the party. 
  The situation still exists in which to do economic work and 
to develop production fails to be closely linked with the 
national defense and security task; in many localities, 
production installations have neglected their national defense 
and military task, which occupies no place in their activities. 
  This is one of the reasons that directly create great 
difficulties for the efforts to organize and build the MSF, 
particularly in the case of the state-bloc self-defense force. 
It is due to this problem that, in many developed production 
installations, workers earn high incomes but have no budget to 
cover expenses for training and other activities. In the last 
two years, in Military Region 5, training and other activities 
took place each year at only 10-15 percent of its production 
installations. MSF organization existed in name only or in some 
localities, was reduced to a minimum level, that is, in each 
village (subward), local production installations had only five 
to 10 people forming their professional protection force. 
  This is a situation that conforms wrongly to the 
characteristics, function, and task of the MSF. 
  As we face the above-mentioned situation, do we organize the 
MSF in the various economic sectors? What are the policies that 
guarantee them? And so on. In our opinion, this is a difficult 
and rather complicated problem, but first of all we must assert 
the following: Since production is multisectoral, the 
organization of the MSF cannot limit itself within just a few of 
the economic sectors. This is an objective necessity and also a 
part of the renovation in connection with the organization and 
building of the MSF in the new situation. This originates 
from the line on renovation as it is recommended in the 
resolutions of the sixth and seventh party congresses for the 
period of transition to socialism and for continuing to build 
the multisectoral commodity economy, with socialist regulation 
and preset direction. At the same time, this is an urgent need 
in connection with the protection of production and the fight 
against the enemy's strategy of peace development, rioting and 
overthrow, and destruction that each and every locality and 
production installation is required to satisfy. 
  If we invest in production without investing in protection 
of 
production, our efforts and assets will soon vanish. Or if we 
avoid the task, adopt a wait-and-see attitude, and rely on 
others to provide us with protection, we will be acting against 
the instinct for self-preservation and the view of our party and 
nation on independence, self-rule, and self-sufficiency. 
  To build the MSF in the various economic sectors also is 
based on the view on the people being considered the roots, on 
the nation's traditions, and on the real needs of production 
today. 
  In the war of resistance against the French, we were 
building 
our forces by going from zero and from small to large scale. The 
armed forces that had come from the people had shown 
revolutionary understanding, hatred for the enemy, and the 
voluntary desire to hold arms to fight the enemy and to wage a 
great people's war to score victory. At that time we had not 
yet organized any state-operated and collective production. 
  In the course of changing our direction and reorganizing our 
forces, we need to thoroughly understand these needs: 
  -- Organizing the MSF must conform to the party leadership 
system; ensure all aspects of direct leadership by the party 
committee echelons and chapters in production installations; 
remain closely linked with administrative units; and reorganize 
production units, shifts, sectors, and occupations in all 
economic sectors so as to facilitate activities and management. 
  -- On what scale to organize the MSF depends on how advanced 
our management and command capabilities are and our efforts to 
avoid being formal and imposing our will. 
  -- On the basis of the task to remain combat-ready, to 
fight, 
and to maintain political security, let us fight the enemy's 
strategy of peace development, rioting, and overthrow in 
different regions and develop our ability to ensure such a task 
so as to have the right scale for organizing appropriate forces. 
  By adopting the three above-mentioned needs as the point of 
departure, Military Region 5 has been organizing its forces in 
all areas and in economic sectors as follows: 
  1. For Rural Areas and Streets 
  To organize the MSF on the basis of such administrative 
units 
as hamlets, villages, wards, and population centers and to 
consider them the basic MSF units, being linked with the party 
chapter (or party cell) leadership, with the hamlet system of 
administration, and with association chapters of political 
organizations in production installations. To set up hamlet 
military unit commands to replace the former local platoon and 
company commands. In 1991, throughout Military Region 5 more 
than 3,600 hamlet military unit cadres were organized. 
  Some favorable aspects of the organization of hamlet 
military 
unit commands include the fact that they are closely linked with 
procedural operations at a level lower than that of production 
installations, thus being closer to the masses and to the MSF 
themselves. As these military commands are based on territorial 
division, their authorities are greater than those of platoon 
and company commands; they serve both as the staffs for party 
committee echelons and the administration and as the local MSF 
commanders and managers, and in addition, they also manage the 
reserve forces and fulfill other military functions in the 
localities. The scale for organizing the local forces is as 
follows: to organize them from squads and several squads, 
instead of organizing companies and platoons. 
  2. Organizing MSF on the Sea 
  The MSF on the sea are organized around the state-operated 
and collective sectors as their hard core; at the same time, 
they are organized in the private economic sector, provided 
favorable conditions prevail there and the work is done in 
steady steps. As an immediate task, let us consolidate anew the 
state-operated enterprises and collective production units. As 
for the private economic sector, it is necessary to select those 
people who satisfy the following requirements: 
  -- They must be people with permanent household registration 
in the localities and with permits to work on the sea. 
  -- Their employment is stable; first of all, the people 
being 
selected are those who work on boats and junks and who are both 
workers and partners having contributed their shares of 
capital.[.sup]1[/] 
  -- Politically speaking, they are reliable people. 
  As an immediate task, let us select the boats and junks 
having 100 percent of laborers considered politically qualified, 
or at least 50 percent of the crews, including their captains 
and stokers, being politically qualified, to organize the force. 
  Formula and scale of organization: They must be crews of the 
same boats and junks, be in the same fishing units, have the 
same occupation, fish in the same fishing grounds, share the 
same fishing lanes (open-sea fishing, inshore fishing, and 
onshore fishing), and be in the same administrative units in 
order to make sure that they are organized on the right scale 
and in the right form. 
  The above-mentioned "same" requirements are aimed at 
achieving the goal of making things more convenient for 
management, command, daily activities, training, and combat 
action. 
  As we carried out the above-mentioned guidelines in our 
military region, in the last two years there were changes in the 
MSF operating on the sea, namely, after the period of 1990-1991, 
the private economic sector accounted for 68.5 percent of the 
MSF and the state-operated and collective enterprises accounted 
for only 31.5 percent of the MSF, as compared to the 
cooperatives accounting for 80 percent and the state-operated 
enterprises, 20 percent, as in the past. 
  3. Organizing Self-Defense Forces in Private and 
Jointly Operated Foreign Enterprises 
  -- Self-defense forces are organized only in localities 
where 
party organizations exist. In localities where there are no 
party organizations, self-defense forces are organized where 
there are private enterprises. These forces are placed under the 
leadership of the party committee echelons in the local 
administration and receive direct military command from the 
areas, villages, and subwards concerned. 
  -- Organizing self-defense forces in jointly operated and 
jointly associated enterprises: Only Vietnamese workers with 
permanent household registration in the localities are to be 
selected, as mentioned in Article 23 of the MSF Statutes. 
  4. Organizing Self-Defense Forces in Organs, 
Enterprises, Work Sites, State Farms, and State Forests 
  First we need to organize the MSF among official workers and 
workers with long-term contracts. We must to rely on fixed work 
units like shifts, shops, and production units to organize 
appropriate forces in terms of their scale and form. We 
organize these forces only where we have enough squads. The 
largest scale is company and multicompany; there must be limits 
and it is unnecessary to organize battalions. 
  To ensure participation of the MSF in training and regular 
activities, all echelons must loosen procedures and policies and 
ensure fairness and rationality in terms of interests and 
obligation, in accordance with today's market mechanism. 
Financing comes from these sources: 
  -- Money taken from the spending and budget of the 
localities 
and production installations--including provincial, district 
(city), village (subward), and production installation levels. 
  -- The people's contributions in the form of fixed amounts 
set for each production and farming unit; production 
installations being encouraged to set up MSF support funds, on 
the basis of the motto, "the people discuss, the people appoint, 
the people support," and the people control and supervise. 
  -- Money earned by the MSF from land and forests being 
assigned to them for doing productive work and providing 
services. 
  -- Shares of bonuses earned as the result of good 
activities. 
  Of the four above-mentioned sources the one that results 
from 
security activities aimed at protecting the lives and properties 
of the people and collectives and maintaining political security 
in production installations is the most effective source, which 
must be used to promote other sources. 
  To organize and manage the MSF under the conditions of the 
multisectoral production of commodities and to act in accordance 
with the present market mechanism is a new multifaceted 
ever-changing complicated issue that requires military workers 
in production installations and people having to deal with these 
installations to change the ways they think and do things in 
order to seek the right formula for organizing MSF management. 
To revise the procedures and policies having to do with the MSF 
in order to keep pace with the present mechanism is a task of 
realistic significance that will help to fight and defeat the 
enemy's peace development strategy in production installations. 
Footnote 
  1. In Military Region 5 there are three forms of being 
capital-contributing partners: a) Families invest capital in 
buying the means of fishing and do the work themselves, or hire 
a few laborers. b) Many household families contribute to the 
capital used to buy the means, or to bid successfully for the 
means put on sale by a cooperative at the time of its 
dissolution. c) Owners buy the means and hire laborers to do the 
work. Of the three forms, the first and second ones involve 
stable labor.

<F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Van Tu, member of the Communist Party of </F>
Vietnam Central Committee and president of the Confederation of 
Vietnamese Workers] 
  [Text] In the movement to renovate socialist construction, 
along with the formation of a multifaceted economy and the 
reorganization of production, the Vietnamese working class is 
undergoing many important structural, ideological, and 
psychological changes and changes in labor style. 
  Above all, because of the changes in occupational patterns, 
along with the ranks of workers who have a long tradition of 
revolutionary struggle, ranks of workers have appeared in new 
occupations that use modern technology, that have foreign 
investment, and that are expanding rapidly. This includes the 
oil and gas, information, electronics, posts and 
telecommunications, and service sectors. A number of these 
sectors are quickly moving to the forefront: the shipping, 
aviation, electric power, and light industrial production 
sectors. These changes have in turn led to changes in the value 
rankings of the sectors. Because of the growth of the world 
economic structure and because of their technological 
backwardness, many sectors that were once viewed as "key" 
sectors no longer enjoy that status. 
  Along with this process has been the appearance of more and 
more young and healthy workers who have high educational 
standards, who can assimilate modern technology quickly, and who 
are working in electronic control and microcomputer offices, 
shuttle-less textile mills, and varied labor services networks. 
  The changes in the structure of the economic elements has 
been devastating to those production and commercial 
installations that have clung to the state subsidies mechanism. 
During that period, many enterprises and production and 
commercial installations in the state sector operated at a loss 
and production was stagnant. The workers were not very 
interested in productivity, the quality of the products, or the 
economic results. Tens of billions of dong in commodities 
stagnated and could not be sold because of poor quality and high 
production costs. In the wake of the reorganization of 
production and commerce, at present only about half of the state 
enterprises are regarded as stable and have been issued permits 
to resume operations. About 19 percent of the enterprises have 
been disbanded. 
  Along with this situation is the decline in the ranks of 
state workers and the movement of state-sector production chains 
to other economic elements (about 700,000 people). At the same 
time, the ranks of workers in the nonstate sector have expanded 
rapidly, with the number of such workers increasing to 2.2 
million people by the middle of 1993. The labor pattern is quite 
varied, with self-employed, cooperative, private enterprise, and 
joint enterprise workers. The point worth noting here is that, 
at many factories, enterprises, and production units, the 
ownership rights and dignity of the workers are not respected. 
This has limited the labor zeal and creative abilities of the 
workers and reduced their ability to struggle to defend the 
truth. This is one of the reasons why workers at a number of 
enterprises and factories have left their jobs and gone on 
strike in the past. For example, since 1989, in the state sector 
there have been 27 strikes, and in the private sector there have 
been 17 strikes with economic demands, demands for democracy, 
and so on. On the other hand, the market mechanism has led to 
another phenomenon among some workers and laborers and that is a 
psychology of using personal interests as the motive force for 
action. Unless this psychology is kept in check, it will lead to 
pragmatism, the class concept of some workers will become 
corrupted, and they will not be proud of being members of the 
working class. They will become indifferent to the present 
situation and to the domestic and international political 
situation, their moral quality will decline, and their spirit of 
comradeship and class attachments will fade and be replaced by 
"group" and local relationships. 
  One of the basic causes of the above situation is the state 
subsidies mechanism and the protracted lack of social fairness. 
This has weakened labor zeal, given rise to a concept of 
dependence on others and passivity, corrupted a number of 
workers, and done great damage to the ranks of workers with 
respect to thinking, organization, ethics, way of life, skills, 
and labor style. 
  Many of the positions and policies on workers and production 
and commercial installations have not yet been standardized to 
form a synchronized, unified, and organized operating mechanism 
that can be implemented resolutely. The new management mechanism 
and the economic elements have gone into operation, but the 
necessary laws to go along with this have not yet been 
promulgated. Such laws include a worker and laborer health 
protection law, an unemployment law, and a labor law. 
  On the other hand, because of reorganizing production, of 
the 
more than 700,000 workers who have left the production chain, 
only about 20 percent have managed to find a job. As for work 
conditions, because the machinery and equipment are old and 
outmoded, because the labor environment is dangerous, and 
because protecting the laborers has not been given the proper 
amount of attention, particularly in private enterprises, 
serious accidents occur frequently and work-related illnesses 
are on the rise. Labor intensity is high (averaging 9-10 hours a 
day in the private sector). Incomes are low, and the wages and 
bonuses paid to the laborers are enough for them to satisfy only 
their minimum needs. In the private and joint enterprise 
sectors, the workers and laborers must accept the low incomes if 
they want to have a job and maintain their lives. Because of 
this, the problem here is to provide the workers with an 
adequate standard of living based on their basic wage and 
principal occupation. Skilled industrial workers have been 
allowed to earn a living by crop cultivation, animal husbandry, 
and even trading, and that is why their thinking, psychology, 
and labor style have become more and more remote from a working 
class nature. This will weaken the social class basis of the 
party. 
  However, in the new revolutionary stage, the working class 
has always agreed with the renovation line of the party. It has 
broken away from the old management mechanism, implemented a 
multifaceted economy, and acted in accord with a market 
mechanism controlled by the state. This unanimity shows that the 
working class and its vanguard units have remained united and 
that the party's lines are in accord with the wishes and 
interests of the working class, all strata of laborers, and all 
the people. This is an important factor in ensuring that the 
renovation movement moves in the right direction and is 
successful. 
  As broad political-social organizations of Vietnamese 
workers 
and laborers, the trade union organizations face new challenges 
and new conditions. The trade unions must undergo a major 
renovation with respect to organization and activities so that 
they really become schools of socialism and solidarity and 
protect the interests of Vietnamese workers and laborers in the 
renovation movement. 
  The "wealthy people, strong country, civilized society" 
target put forth at the seventh party congress is a struggle 
target of the working class and Vietnamese trade unions. The 
trade unions must really become the representative of the 
workers in fulfilling the obligations of masters of society and 
masters of the country in the renovation movement to have a 
wealthy people, strong country, and civilized society and to 
build and defend the fatherland. They must give attention to 
protecting the interests of the laborers and participate in 
managing the state. They must be broad organizations for 
mobilizing and educating the laborers. 
  The renovation guidelines concerning trade union 
organization 
and activities must be directed toward the following 
requirements: 
  Attracting large numbers of workers and laborers in the 
economic elements to voluntarily join a trade union and having 
them strive for national stability, democracy, social 
renovation, and the interests of the workers and laborers. 
  Varying the forms of activities and launching a 
revolutionary 
action movement composed of large numbers of workers and 
laborers in order to contribute to hitting the targets and 
carrying out the tasks in the renovation movement. 
  Building a rank of talented trade union cadres with 
organizational capabilities who can carry out the functions of 
the trade unions, who have a close relationship with the masses, 
and who are close to the primary level. 
  Forming an organizational system that is in accord with a 
multifaceted economy that operates based on market mechanisms 
while still maintaining the principle of democratic centralism 
and improving the effectiveness and operating results of the 
trade union organizations at the enterprises and production 
installations. 
  In recent years, the entire trade union system has been in 
turmoil. It has looked for ways to further clarify the 
renovation viewpoints of the party, ensure that trade union 
activities are in accord with the new mechanism, satisfy the 
requirements and tasks of building and defending the fatherland, 
satisfy the needs and hopes of the workers and laborers, give 
attention to and protect their legitimate and legal rights and 
interests, and at the same time give attention to participating 
in controlling the workers and laborers and educating them about 
their obligations. 
  Trade unions at the central echelon and primary level have 
concentrated on spreading propaganda and mobilizing the workers 
and laborers to ensure that they thoroughly understand the 
renovation line of the party and agree with the production 
reorganization policy. Revolving around the target of "jobs, 
living standards, democracy, and social fairness," the various 
echelons have looked for ways to provide jobs and improve the 
work conditions and standard of living of the workers. In the 
difficult conditions of changing mechanisms, the labor movement 
to create and exploit innovations has been maintained. At the 
same time, new emulation movements have been launched with the 
targets being productivity, quality, and results in a market 
mechanism. 
  At many production installations, the trade unions have 
established mutual aid funds to give loans to poor laborers and 
expand the family economy. Many localities have established job 
promotion centers, and a number of places have established legal 
consultation offices. The Secretariat of the Labor Confederation 
has participated in drafting the Constitution, trade union law, 
and many draft laws, regulations, and decrees related to the 
rights and obligations of laborers. 
  In places where labor disputes and conflicts between 
laborers 
and owners have arisen, the trade unions have promptly 
coordinated things with the local authorities to provide direct 
guidance, resolve things on the spot, ensure the legitimate and 
legal interests of the laborers, and quickly stabilize the 
situation. 
  Educating and mobilizing the workers has been renovated, and 
active and self-sufficient nature of the primary level has been 
exploited. The quality of the mass means of information has been 
improved. Summarizing practices and studying theory have been 
promoted in order to ensure that trade union activities are in 
line with the party's lines, to improve commercial production 
results, and to contribute to stabilizing the economic, 
political, and social situation. 
  Emphasis has been given to finding and expanding the 
effective activities of the trade unions in the nonstate sector. 
This is a new and difficult task about which experience must be 
gained while carrying it out. At present, more than 180 
primary-level trade unions, 42 labor unions, and 300 labor 
associations that have attracted approximately 110,000 laborers 
at cooperatives and private and joint enterprises have been 
organized and put into operation. These are initial bases that 
must be studied to see what the best forms are so that they can 
be greatly expanded in the coming period. 
  Giving attention to building primary-level trade unions and 
to learning the experiences at the bases where trade union 
activities are strong, many typical examples such as the Ba Song 
Factory, the Cam My Rubber State Farm, the Hai Duong Porcelain 
Plant, the Deo Nai Coal Mine, and so on have been reported and 
copied throughout the country. 
  However, because of operating for so long within a state 
subsidies mechanism, when switching to the new mechanism, the 
various-echelon trade unions have exhibited confusion and 
passivity. In guiding and implementing things, not all of the 
complex changes of the market mechanism can be gauged. There is 
a lack of concrete measures, and the trade unions have been slow 
to get involved in social activities. In the market mechanism, 
now that a labor market has been formed, the issues of 
ownership, hired labor, salaries, wages, labor protection, and 
improvement of labor conditions are very difficult and pressing 
issues. But the trade unions have been slow to study these 
issues. Also, the trade unions have not done a good job of 
educating the workers or getting them to respond to the action 
movements. In the nonstate sector, they have persuaded only 5 
percent of the laborers and 10 percent of the production 
installations to join a trade union. 
  In the coming period, the various-echelon trade unions will 
face even greater tasks. The trade unions must concentrate on 
mobilizing the working class. Regardless of which economic 
element they are working at, they must maintain labor discipline 
and good solidarity, exploit the creative potential, improve 
techniques, increase productivity, improve product quality, 
reduce production costs, contribute to expanding the 
multifaceted commodity economy and bringing the country out of 
poverty and backwardness, and strive to hit the "wealthy people, 
strong country, and civilized society" target. Above all, the 
trade unions must take steps to strengthen the state sector, 
manifest results, and play a guiding role in the economy. 
Together with the state, the trade unions must create the 
conditions and an environment in which the nonstate economic 
elements can grow. They must actively contribute to expanding 
agriculture, building the new rural areas, and solidifying the 
worker-peasant-intellectual alliance in renovating building and 
defending the fatherland. 
  The trade unions must give attention to protecting the 
interests of the workers and laborers and participate in 
formulating laws and policies related to laborers. They must 
actively participate, together with the state, in creating jobs 
and improving work conditions. The primary-level trade unions 
must, as the representative of the workers, sign collective 
labor agreements with the owners of the enterprises in accord 
with the laws and monitor the implementation of those 
agreements. They must discover and resolve the conflicts that 
arise between owners and laborers. 
  The trade unions must launch the workers and laborers in a 
struggle against corruption and smuggling and actively 
contribute to building a strong party and administration. 
  They must renovate propaganda and training, contribute to 
building a strong working class, and take the lead in renovating 
the country. They must promptly enter into a dialogue with and 
grasp the thoughts and attitudes of the workers and laborers and 
grasp the conflicts that have arisen because of the mechanisms 
and policies so that they can submit timely proposals to the 
party and state to resolve the conflicts. They must safeguard 
the interests of the country and laborers and contribute to 
maintaining political stability and social order. 
  They must continue to renovate organization and improve the 
abilities and capabilities of the ranks of trade union cadres. 
They must adhere to the principle of democratic centralism in 
trade union organization and activities. They must vary the 
forms used to assemble the workers and laborers in the economic 
elements. Emphasis must be given to guiding and renovating 
primary-level trade union activities. Attention must be given to 
summarizing the practices and conducting theoretical studies on 
trade union activities in the new mechanism. 
  Economic activities must be promoted, and additional 
financial sources must be created for trade union activities. 
Cooperation with foreign trade unions and international 
organizations must be strengthened and expanded. 
  In the face of the many changes in the domestic and 
international situation, the Vietnamese working class has 
undergone profound changes. This shows that the Vietnamese 
working class is always sensitive to what is new and can adapt 
quickly to the new. But this class is still the most progressive 
production force. It adheres to the key material bases and 
controls the activities of all of society. Because of this, it 
still has the mission, and ability, to take the lead in the 
development of society. 
  Thus, building a strong Vietnamese working class is a 
decisive matter for the renovation of the country. This is not 
an issue just for the trade unions. It is also a task for the 
entire political system and the responsibility of each cadre and 
party member.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "New Agenda on Arm-Twisting"] </F>
  [Text] In a joint statement on nuclear non-proliferation, 
Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin have asked India and 
Pakistan to be a part of the multilateral talks aimed at 
"transforming the subcontinent into a nuclear-free zone." While 
Mr. Clinton's crusading zeal to keep Asia tethered on the other 
side of the nuclear divide is old hat, the surprise package is 
Mr. Yeltsin's adoption of Mr. Clinton's preachy role -- to India 
and Pakistan -- on missile and nuclear non-proliferation. No 
doubt, Mr. Yeltsin is toeing the American line, but it is 
totally at variance -- therefore, the surprise -- with the more 
guardedly prudent stand of the former Soviet Union, which had 
not publicly joined the London Club on the nuclear issue. And, 
therefore, tactfully avoided pressing India too hard on the NPT 
[Nonproliferation Treaty] issue. Mr. Yeltsin apparently has no 
such compunctions in joining the Big-League in its 
discriminatory attitude of keeping the Third World away from 
nuclear technology. India's reluctance to do so is a morally 
justifiable one. While she has not balked at the prospect of a 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty coming into force in 1996, India 
has taken exception to the regional pressure that is being 
applied on her to accept the NPT, or its regional variation 
cobbled together by Islamabad and Washington. The position 
taken by the presidents of America and Russia makes little sense 
if the nuclear weapons powers continue to exercise their 
prerogative of testing and developing their nucelar arsenals. A 
vapid declaration of "no first use" sounds even sillier, if also 
discriminatory, when the U.S. in particular laughs at any 
suggestion of a global ban on nuclear testing as a first step 
towards eliminating all nuclear weapons. The "have's," it would 
appear, are not so susceptible to U.S. pressures on nuclear 
disarmament, and can with impunity cock a snook at Uncle Sam's 
vain glorious threats of applying economic sanctions on those 
found guilty of testing. China exploded her nuclear device with 
aplomb; and North Korea unequivocally showed that "tough 
measures" just would not work. But what of the U.S. indulgences 
that have been responsible for furnishing Israel's "clandestine 
nuclear arsenal," and of overlooking Pakistan's boast of 
possessing military nuclear capability? Mr. Clinton and Mr. 
Yeltsin would do well to desist from feeding us such pious 
homilies on NPT, and revise their opinions on what India should, 
or should not, do. India's security imperatives -- surrounded as 
she is with nuclear warheads cutting a wide swathe from the 
Central Asian Republics to the Indian Ocean and eastwards in 
China -- demand a certain policy. There should be global action 
for the elimination of all nuclear weapons. Pakistan's premier 
Benazir Bhutto has said that her country will not roll back its 
nuclear programme "under any circumstances." Surely, there is a 
limit to which India can be pushed.

  [Text] Baghdad, Jan 31 (INA)--Another chapter of U.S.-led 
conspiracy has opened with the allegations that German and Saudi 
inspectors have found two containers loaded with hundreds of 
tons of chemicals on board a freighter at Jeddah Port in Saudi 
Arabia. The inspectors claim that the freighter was heading to 
Beirut where the chemicals were to be unloaded and transported 
to Iraq which will use the stuff in making missiles, says THE 
BAGHDAD OBSERVER editorial. 
  The news spread as quickly as possible and the Western as 
well as the American media flexed their muscles in manipulating 
the allegations to serve their masters' interests. The 
above-mentioned media quoted a German official as saying that 
German intelligence has obtained the information of the 
freighter from their Saudi counterpart. 
  Those who have fabricated this story are themselves the same 
enemy of Iraq. They themselves were behind the imposition of 
sanctions against the Iraqis and they themselves were parties to 
the U.S.-led aggression which destroyed Iraq's infrastructure 
and killed thousands of innocent Iraqi people. Hence what they 
claim comes as no surprise to the Iraqis who are well-aware of 
the tactics of their enemy, the editorial added. 
  When Iraq announced that it was ready to abide by all UN 
resolutions these dubious circles began to launch campaigns with 
the aim of putting a spoke in the wheel of Iraq [words 
indistinct] states to even recommend the lifting of the more 
than three years sanctions against a nation of 18 million people. 
  The daily maintained that the human rights issues was on top 
of U.S. agenda of conspiracy against Iraq. The U.S. and its 
allies Britain and France in particular released their 
accusation against Iraq and said that Iraq was abusing human 
rights in the south of the country and denying the people in the 
north food rations. What these circles alleged is definitely 
false because those people, the Iraqis, who live in the south of 
the country are suffering from the same sanctions imposed on 
Iraq by the UN under U.S. pressures. As to the people of the 
north, the Iraqi Government sends them their food ration 
regularly. But the outlawed elements there, supported by the 
U.S. and its allies, steal the food ration of their people and 
sell it in the black market. 
  Today the U.S. and its allies have created another way to 
distort Iraq's reputation before the international community 
which is calling for an end to the blockade imposed on the 
Iraqis. Furthermore, the Saudi regime for its part has been 
showering money upon their puppets in the Western and American 
media to publicize such a lie, the motive of which is well-known 
for the Iraqis. The Saudi regime only wants to keep the embargo 
on Iraq to serve the interests of its allies. 
  Nevertheless it has become crystal clear that the U.S. and 
their agents including the Saudi puppets can never succeed in 
either undermining the morale of the Iraqis, nor can they 
deceive the world public opinion because the truth will soon 
come up and those who fabricated the allegations will be exposed 
by their own people, THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER concluded.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 Jan (INA) -- The Foreign Ministry 
tonight categorically dismissed western and American news media 
allegations of chemicals used in the manufacture of fuels for 
missiles being found aboard a German ship coming from Saudi 
Arabia. Following is the text of the statement: 
  Western and American news media have attributed a statement 
to Dieter Vogel, a German Government official, in which he said 
that German intelligence services have had access to information 
from Saudi Arabia to the effect that a search of a German 
freighter, docked at the Port of Jeddah, by Saudi and German 
inspectors turned up two containers including hundreds of tonnes 
of a chemical stuff, used in the manufacture of fuels for 
missiles. 
  [word indistinct] this ship [words indistinct] chemicals 
[word indistinct] from China and then [words indistinct] of its 
freight in Hong Kong. The vessel's travel plan called for it to 
dock in Cyprus before proceeding to Beirut, its final 
destination. The ship owners then claimed that the chemicals 
consignment was to have been transported from Beirut to Iraq. 
  The Foreign Ministry hereby categorically denies these 
allegations. The fabrication of lies has become a hackneyed 
tactic resorted to by certain quarters known for their hostility 
toward Iraq and the Iraqi people, among them the Saudi regime. 
The idea is to level baseless accusations against Iraq, spread 
lies, and cast doubt with the object of keeping the wicked 
blockade in place. This is because more and more circles and 
nations within and outside the UN Security Council are demanding 
the removal of the blockade. 
  The Foreign Ministry hereby condemns these groundless 
allegations and the role of the guileful Saudi regime in making 
up such lies.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, Jan 10 (AFP) -- Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk has been invited to join a summit meeting 
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian leader Boris 
Yeltsin after Moscow and Kiev reached an agreement in principle 
on the future of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal, the Kremlin 
announced Monday. 
  Yeltsin's press service said the Russian leader had invited 
Kravchuk to Friday's summit after reaching an "agreement in 
principle on certain important issues of shared interest, 
including nuclear weapons." 
  A presidential spokesman declined to elaborate on the 
agreement, but Clinton has previously said that he would only 
meet with Kravchuk after an accord had been finalized on the 
dismantling of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal. 
  Yeltsin's spokesman would only say that discussions were 
under way concerning several documents that the three leaders 
would be signing during their meeting in Moscow. [passage

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 13 TASS -- Documents on problems on 
nuclear arms in Ukraine are expected to be signed at a 
tripartite summit of Russia, the United States and Ukraine on 
Friday. A mechanism of the implementation of Ukraine's decision 
on the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its territory will 
also be worked out, ITAR-TASS learned from informed sources on 
Thursday. 
  This applies to 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 
some 1,500 warheads. Weapons that, in opinion of the U.S. side, 
are the most dangerous ones, SS-24 and SS-19 missiles, are to be 
dismantled within three years under an agreement that is to be 
signed. 
  The signing of the documents on dismantling the entire 
Ukrainian nuclear potential is to end a prolonged debate on the 
destiny of the Soviet nuclear arsenal that remained in the 
Ukrainian territory after the Soviet Union's dissolution in 
1991. This will mean keeping to the schedule outlined in the 
1992 Lisbon protocols. Under the protocols two other former 
Union republics with nuclear arms -- Kazakhstan and Belarus -- 
supported the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and agreed to 
destroy nuclear arms, turning them over to Russia for the 
purpose. 
  But the Ukrainian parliament, ratifying the Strategic Arms 
Limitation Treaty on November 18, 1993, made a number of 
reservations: on the control of strategic nuclear forces in the 
Ukrainian territory, on the elimination of extra carriers and 
charges, on control over disassembly and destruction of nuclear 
charges. Ukraine made its non-nuclear status and stage-by-stage 
elimination of nuclear weapons conditional upon guarantees of 
its national security by nuclear states. 
  Several rounds of tripartite talks of Russia, Ukraine and 
the 
United States were held last month. The foreign press notes 
they were held until President Clinton said in Brussels on 
Monday that an agreement on problems of nuclear arms in Ukraine 
became a reality. 
  The compensation and splitting between Ukraine and Russia of 
proceeds from the sale of enriched uranium was among central 
problems at the talks. The United States pledged itself to form 
a semi-state corporation which will buy uranium contained in 
warheads for nuclear power plants to make up for the 
expenditures for nuclear arms destruction. In the runup to the 
President's visit to Moscow, the U.S. Congress earmarked a sum 
of 175 million dollars as a step to promote the destruction of 
nuclear warheads in Ukraine, to compensate for the dismantling 
of nuclear arms. The U.S. Congress also endorses economic aid 
to Ukraine amounting to 155 million dollars. 
  Participants in the tripartite negotiations believe the 
signing of documents on problems of nuclear arms in Ukraine must 
ease tensions that have complicated relations between the United 
States, Russia and Ukraine of late. New agreements in Moscow 
will promote the establishment of peace and tranquility in the 
world and a greater cooperation of the three countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F>
correspondent Natalya Chernyshova at Moscow airport on 13 
January; from the "Novosti" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] Chernyshova: Leonid Makarovich, would 
you say a few words about your talks with Clinton? 
  Kravchuk: They were good, normal talks. We 
discussed several problems. The first one, naturally, was the 
nuclear problem; the second, the economic one, our relations 
with the United States. We discussed questions connected with 
tomorrow's signing of documents by the presidents of Russia, the 
United States, and Ukraine. I think this is a great 
breakthrough, a political breakthrough, an economic 
breakthrough. The main thing is that we have succeeded in 
resolving a very complicated global problem -- the nuclear one 
-- in a civilized way, in the interests of our states, Russia, 
Ukraine, and the United States, and, of course, of the entire 
world. 
  Chernyshova: And what compromises have been made 
by Ukraine and by Russia? 
  Kravchuk: Well, the compromises are natural. We 
have reached an agreement. That is no longer a secret -- 
compensation for Ukraine's tactical nuclear weapons, and, of 
course, the agreements which have already been signed on 
strategic nuclear weapons, normal economic relations, normal 
economic ties, the exclusion of any pressure, territorial 
integrity of states, mutual respect, relations of partnership. 
That is to say, frankly, that this is nothing new. It is all 
generally accepted in the world. The only thing is that we have 
so far been finding it very difficult to get accustomed to this. 
  Chernyshova: Will the Ukrainian parliament ratify 
this agreement? 
  Kravchuk: I think it will ratify the agreement 
because it is a good solution for everyone, including us. It is 
good in that it increases our people's awareness that we are 
being treated with respect, normally, as a country, as a state, 
and not as some -- well -- secondary appendage. That is the 
first point. Second, everything is being resolved fairly, 
therefore the parliament must ratify. I am convinced of this. 
  Chernyshova: And tomorrow you will sign the 
agreement? 
  Kravchuk: Absolutely!

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 14 January -- After the signing of the 
trilateral documents on the elimination of nuclear weapons on 
the territory of Ukraine, Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton, and 
Leonid Kravchuk replied to journalists' questions. 
  "We have not thought nor do we think that Ukraine ever posed 
any danger to Russia, but this is a historic day for the 
international community. The documents on Ukraine's elimination 
of nuclear weapons and adherence to the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the three Presidents signed, are 
another step in the nuclear disarmament of the world," Boris 
Yeltsin said, replying to a question by an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent. [passage omitted] 
  Leonid Kravchuk told journalists that starting today, 
"Ukraine's security has been substantially enhanced, because by 
signing these documents along with the Presidents of Russia and 
the United States it has obtained from each confirmation of its 
security."

  [Text] Documents with regard to the Russian-U.S. talks are 
to be signed in the Kremlin today. Our observer Yuliy Semenov 
has the details and is on the phone: 
  [Semenov:] Hello again from the Kremlin. The Kremlin is 
magnificent, as ever, but both presidents and their assistants 
have other things on their minds, working hard since early 
morning. 
  Several minutes ago the trilateral meeting smoothly turned 
into a bilateral one. Documents on the results of the meeting 
between the three presidents connected with the problem of 
Ukraine's nuclear disarmament have been signed: a joint 
statement, which has the status of a treaty, an appendix to it, 
and letters that the delegations exchanged, setting out their 
specific views. 
  The essence of what has taken place is that the agreement 
that has been reached reflects a balance of interests. Each 
side had to make some concessions, but the final result is a 
victory for all--a victory for the principle of the 
non-proliferation of nuclear arms. 
  Two hundred nuclear warheads will be transported from 
Ukraine 
into Russia over the next 10 months, and the withdrawal 
timetable will be agreed on. It is not being made public 
because it is a working schedule. 
  The United States and Russia extend security guarantees to 
Ukraine. Great Britain, as is known, has already joined in 
this. Russia will compensate Ukraine in an equitable and honest 
way--as Boris Yeltsin put it--for its nuclear fuel, and a 
proportion of Ukraine's financial debt to Russia is wiped off as 
part of this compensation. 
  For its part, the United States will substantially assist 
Russia and Ukraine in the implementation of the accords, and 
this naturally includes material assistance. All the 
participants in the meeting have appraised these results as a 
breakthrough. 
  Replying to journalists' questions following the signing of 
the documents--a brief meeting took place--Yeltsin said that 
this was a historic day for the nuclear security of the whole 
world and for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and was 
an important step in world disarmament. 
  Bill Clinton's view is that by agreeing to sign these 
documents and to resolve problems, Ukraine has made its position 
in the world weightier, having strengthened the security of the 
United States, Russia, Ukraine, and world security as a whole. 
Clinton said that the potential for nuclear espionage, 
terrorism, and blackmail has been diminished. 
  This will make it possible both for Russia and Ukraine to 
raise their living standards for their citizens. His view is 
that Ukrainian prestige will grow in the world; more people and 
states will wish to cooperate with Ukraine, and Ukraine will be 
altogether better off as a result. 
  Finally, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said that his 
view was that this step would help strengthen everyone's 
security and the security of Ukraine in particular, because it 
was precisely in the U.S. and Russian guarantees--their nuclear 
umbrella--that Ukraine saw its security. If we are friends with 
Ukraine and Russia, nothing will threaten us. [sentence as heard] 
  Currently, as I am speaking, the Russian-American dialogue 
has been resumed--a plenary session of both delegations with all 
officials present is taking place in the Yekaterinskiy Hall in 
the Kremlin. 
  A whole package of U.S.-Russian documents will subsequently 
be signed, to be followed by a news conference, during which we 
will be given complete information.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Embassy of Ukraine in Austria--date not </F>
given] 
  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Speaking at a plenary 
session of the special forum committee of the CSCE for 
cooperation in the area of security in Vienna on 19 January, 
Ambassador Yu. Kostenko, head of the delegation, informed the 
participants about the signing of the tripartite statement in 
Moscow by the Presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and 
Russia on the problem of nuclear disarmament. The 
representative of Ukraine noted that this statement, the text of 
which was disseminated at the CSCE forum on behalf of the 
delegations from Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, crowned 
a long political and diplomatic marathon and is a result of 
intensive and complex work. It confirmed a well-known truth: 
Any problem, even the most complex ones, can be resolved only 
by way of compromises. The ambassador drew attention to the 
fact that the tripartite statement mentions political guarantees 
of Ukraine's security too -- that is it confirms its 
independence, sovereignty, and existing borders. 
  The representative of Ukraine emphasized that the Ukrainian 
Government is counting, in connection with the elimination of 
nuclear weapons located in Ukraine, on receiving from the CSCE 
the necessary assistance and support in ensuring Ukraine's 
national security on the basis of the principles of the Helsinki 
Final Act. 
  On behalf of the European Union, the head of Greece's 
delegation read out an EC communique in connection with the 
tripartite statement. The communique evaluates highly the 
accords achieved and expresses the hope that the legislative 
procedures necessary for them to come into force will be carried 
out without delay. 
  Speaking at the session, representatives from the United 
States and Russia also evaluated highly the tripartite accords, 
emphasized that they are opening the way to nuclear disarmament, 
and expressed the hope that they will come into force and be 
fully implemented in the near future.

  [Text] Grigoriy Karasin, Russian Foreign Ministry's 
official representative, has confirmed that Moscow will provide 
Ukraine with fuel elements for the needs of atomic power 
engineering as a compensation for the nuclear charges which are 
being withdrawn. Speaking at a briefing in Moscow he added that 
the purchase by the United States of a part of the uranium 
released during the dismantling of nuclear weapons would 
contribute to solving the financial issues which emerge in this 
context.

<H3>  Joint Statement by the President of the Russian Federation 
and the President of the United States on Non-Proliferation of 
Weapons of Mass Destruction and the Means of Their Delivery </H3>
  [Text] President Yeltsin and President Clinton, during their 
meeting in Moscow on January 14, 1994, agreed that the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their missile 
delivery systems represents an acute threat to international 
security in the period following the end of the cold war. They 
declared the resolve of their countries to cooperate actively 
and closely with each other, and also with other interested 
states, for the purpose of preventing and reducing this threat. 
  The presidents noted that the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons created a serious threat to the security of all states, 
and expressed their intention to take energetic measures aimed 
at prevention of such proliferation. 
  -- Considering the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
Nuclear 
Weapons as the basis for efforts to ensure the non-proliferation 
of nuclear weapons, they called for its indefinite and 
unconditional extension at conference of its participants in 
1995, and they urged that all states that have not yet done so 
accede to this treaty. 
  -- They expressed their resolve to implement effective 
measures to limit and reduce nuclear weapons. In this 
connection, they advocated the most rapid possible entry into 
force of the START I and START II Treaties. 
  -- They agreed to review jointly appropriate ways to 
strengthen security assurances for the states which have 
renounced the possession of nuclear weapons and comply strictly 
with their non- proliferation obligations. 
  -- They expressed their support for the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] in its efforts to carry out its safeguards 
responsibilities. They also expressed their intention to 
provide assistance to the agency in the safeguards field, 
including through joint efforts of their relevant laboratories 
to improve safeguards. 
  -- They supported the nuclear suppliers group, and agreed 
with the need for effective implementation of the principle of 
full-scope IAEA safeguards as a condition for nuclear exports 
with the need for export controls on dual-use materials and 
technology in the nuclear field. 
  -- They reaffirmed their countries' commitment to the 
conclusion as soon as possible of an international treaty to 
achieve a comprehensive ban on nuclear test explosions and 
welcomed the decision to begin negotiations at the conference on 
disarmament. They declared their firm intention to provide 
political support for the negotiating process, and appealed to 
other states to refrain from carrying out nuclear explosions 
while these talks are being held. 
  -- They noted that an important contribution to the goal of 
non- proliferation of nuclear weapons would be made by a 
verifiable ban on the production of fissile materials for 
nuclear weapons and by the most rapid conclusion of an 
international convention to this effect with the widest possible 
participation of states and on a non-discriminatory basis. 
  -- They agreed to cooperate with each other and also with 
other states to elaborate measures designed to prevent the 
accumulation of excessive stocks of fissile materials and over 
time to reduce such stocks. 
  -- They agreed to establish a joint working group to 
consider: 
  -- including in their voluntary IAEA safeguards offers all 
source and special fissionable materials, excluding only those 
facilities associated with activities having direct national 
security significance; 
  -- steps to ensure the transparency and irreversibility of 
the progress of reduction of nuclear weapons, including the 
possibility of putting a portion of fissionable material under 
IAEA safeguards. Particular attention would be given to 
materials released in the process of nuclear disarmament and 
steps to ensure that these materials would not be used again for 
nuclear weapons. 
  -- The presidents also tasked their experts to study options 
for the long-term disposition of fissile materials, particularly 
of plutonium, taking into account the issues of 
non-proliferation, environmental protection, safety, and 
technical and economic factors. 
  -- They reaffirmed the intention of interested organizations 
of the two countries to complete within a short time a joint 
study of the possibilities of terminating the production of 
weapon-grade plutonium. 
  -- The presidents agreed that reduction of the risk of theft 
or diversion of nuclear materials is a high priority, and in 
this context they noted the usefulness of the September 1993 
agreement to cooperate in improving the system of controls, 
accounting, and physical protection for nuclear materials. They 
attached great significance to further joint work on the 
separate but mutually connected problems of accounting for 
nuclear materials used in the civilian an military fields. 
  Both presidents favored a further increase in the efforts to 
prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. 
  -- As the heads of the countries that have the world's 
largest stockpiles of chemical weapons, they acknowledged 
particular responsibility for eliminating the threat posed by 
these weapons. In this context, they declare their resolute 
support for the convention on the prohibition of chemical 
weapons, and their intention to promote ratification as rapidly 
as possible and entry into force of the convention not later 
than 1995. 
  -- To promote implementation of a comprehensive ban on 
chemical weapons, they welcomed the conclusion of the 
implementing documents for the Wyoming memorandum of 
understanding and agreed to conclude work in as short a time as 
possible on the implementing documents for the bilateral 
agreement on the destruction of chemical weapons. 
  -- The presidents reaffirmed their desire to facilitate the 
safe, secure, timely, and ecologically sound destruction of 
chemical weapons in the Russian federation and the United 
States. The applauded the joint chemical weapons destruction 
work plan recently concluded between the two countries which 
leads the way for the united states to provide additional 30 
million dollars in assistance to support an analytical chemical 
laboratory in Russia to facilitate chemical weapons destruction. 
The United States also agreed to consider appropriate 
additional measures to support Russia's chemical weapons 
destruction programme. 
  -- They reiterated the importance of strict compliance with 
the convention on the prohibition of biological and toxin 
weapons and of continued implementation of measures in 
accordance with the Russian- American-British statement of 
September 1992, which provides inter alia for the visits of 
facilities and meetings between experts in order to ensure 
confidence in the compliance with the convention. 
  -- They supported convening a special conference of the 
states' parties to the convention on the prohibition of 
biological and toxin weapons in order to consider measures that 
would contribute to transparency and thereby confidence in 
compliance with the convention and its effectiveness. 
  The presidents expressed the determination of their 
countries 
to cooperate with each other in preventing the proliferation of 
missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction. 
  -- They welcomed the conclusion of the bilateral memorandum 
of understanding between the Government of the Russian 
Federation an the Government of the United States of America 
signed in September 1993, noted the importance of this agreement 
for ensuring mutually beneficial cooperation between Russia and 
the U.S. in the field of space exploration, and agreed to 
collaborate closely in order to ensure its full and timely 
implementation. 
  -- The U.S. welcomed Russia's intention to join the Missile 
Technology Control Regime [MTCR] and undertook to cooperate with 
Russia in facilitation of its membership at an early date. The 
Russian Federation and the United States of America are certain 
that further improving the MTCR, including the prudent expansion 
of membership, will help reduce the threat of proliferation of 
missiles and missile techologies in the regional context as well. 
  The presidents of the two countries agreed that, in addition 
to strengthening global norms of non-proliferation and working 
out agreements to this effect, close cooperation is essential in 
order to develop policies on non-proliferation applicable to 
specific regions posing the greatest risk of proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. 
  -- They agreed that nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula 
would represent a grave threat to regional and international 
security, and decided that their countries would consult with 
each other on ways to eliminate this danger. They called upon 
the DPRK to honour fully its obligation under the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its safeguards 
agreement with the IAEA in connection with the treaty, and to 
resolve the problems of safeguards implementation, inter alia, 
through dialogue between IAEA and DPRK. They also urged full and 
speedy implementation of the joint declaration of the ROK and 
the DPRK on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
  -- They support efforts to reach agreement on the 
establishment of a multi-lateral forum to consider measures in 
the field of arms control in non-proliferation that could 
strengthen security in South Asia. They call on India and 
Pakistan to join in the negotiation of and become original 
signatories to the treaty banning nuclear weapons test 
explosions and the proposed convention to ban production of 
fissile materials for nuclear explosives and to refrain from 
deploying ballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of 
mass destruction to each other's territories. 
  -- They agreed that Russia and the U.s., as co-chairs in the 
Middle East peace process, would actively promote progress in 
the activity of the working group for arms control and regional 
security in the Middle East, striving for speedy implementation 
of confidence-building measures and working toward turning the 
Middle East into a region free of weapons of mass destruction, 
where conventional forces would not exceed reasonable defense 
needs. 
  -- They firmly supported the efforts of the UN special 
commission and the IAEA to put into operation a long-term 
monitoring system of the military potential of Iraq, and called 
upon Iraq to comply with all UN Security Council resolutions.

  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- The Russian and US 
Presidents called on all states of the world to join the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty and pledged to cooperate in order to 
prevent the spread of mass destruction weapons. 
  The Presidents called for an "indefinite and unconditional 
extention" of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty at the 
conference of its participants in 1995 and "urged that all 
states that have not yet done so to accede to this treaty," 
according to a joint statement adopted by Boris Yeltsin and Bill 
Clinton on Friday. 
  They called on North Korea to honour its obligations under 
the treaty and urged a full and speedy denuclearisation of the 
Korean peninsula. They also called on India and Pakistan to 
refrain from deploying ballistic missiles capable of delivering 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  In order to promote the non-proliferation regime the 
Presidents stressed the need for a comprehensive ban on nuclear 
tests and on the production of fissile materials for nuclear 
weapons, including military plutonium. 
  Yeltsin and Clinton reaffirmed their desire "to facilitate 
the safe, secure, timely and ecologically sound destruction of 
chemical weapons" in Russia and the United States. 
  The USA is going to provide "additional 30 million dollars 
in 
assistance to support an anlytical chemical laboratory in Russia 
to facilitate chemical weapons destruction... And to consider 
other measures to support Russia's chemical weapons destruction 
programme," according to the document. [punctuation as received] 
  The Presidents also urged a strict compliance with the 
convention prohibiting biological and toxin weapons and pledged 
to cooperate in preventing the proliferation of missiles capable 
of carrying mass destruction weapons.

  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- The Russo-American 
contract on the sale of enriched uranium was signed at the 
Russian Ministry of Atomic Power on Friday. Russian President 
Yeltsin welcomed the agreement at a news conference in Moscow on 
the same day. "I am very satisfied that an agreement on uranium 
was signed," he said. 
  Under the contract to operate for 20 years, Russia plans to 
turn over to the United States 500 metric tonnes of weapon-grade 
uranium worth around 12 billion dollars. It will be extracted 
from 20 thousand units of nuclear ammunition during its 
elimination. 
  The uranium will be reprocessed to serve as fuel for nuclear 
power plants. 
  Russian Minister of Atomic Power Viktor Mikhaylov said on 
Friday that this agreement means a step to real nuclear 
disarmament. He said the contract was concluded under an 
intergovernmental agreement between Russia and the United States 
signed in February last. 
  The need for joint work with the United States in this area 
stems from the fact that the United States controls 50 per cent 
of the world market of uranium, while Russia's share in this 
market is only five to six per cent. "The contract will bring to 
Russia a source of foreign cerrency, while the industry of the 
U.S. can draw on Russian technologies," the minister believes. 
  There was a separate discussion during the preparation for 
the signing of the contract on the sharing of profits from the 
contract between Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. The 
minister said it is for experts to establish if there is profit 
from the elimination of tactical nuclear weapons. Vast funds 
are so far spent on the dismantling of nuclear weapons and 
utilisation of nuclear charges. 
  Experts believe the document signed on Friday has a 
commercial chararter in addition to political. William Timbers, 
the head of the U.S. side at the signing, acting manager of the 
U.S. enrichment corporation, said it is the first time in 
history that disarmament can bring profit to states.

  [Text] Moscow January 14 TASS -- The Russian and U.S. 
Presidents agreed to detarget their strategic nuclear missiles, 
aimed at each other's country by June 1994, thus ending nearly a 
50-year period when the two superpowers viewed each other as the 
main adversaries. 
  "The Presidents announced that they would direct the 
detargeting of strategic nuclear missiles under their respective 
commands so that by not later than May 30, 1994 those missiles 
will not be targeted." according to the Moscow Declaration 
signed by Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton on Friday. 
  "Thus, for the first time in nearly half a century--virtualy 
since the dawn of the nuclear age--the United States and Russia 
will not operate nuclear forces, day-to-day, in a manner that 
presumes they are adversaries," according to the document. 
  The Presidents also urged to end nuclear tests and observe 
the nuclear and other non-proliferation regimes. 
  They "strongly supported completion of negotiations on a 
comprehensive test ban at the earliest possible time" and 
"expressed concern over increasing challenges to global 
non-proliferation regimes," the declaration said. 
  The Presidents "agreed upon the need to strengthen those 
regimes and... to create a new mechanism to enhance 
transparency and responsibility in the transfer of conventional 
arms and sensitive dual use technologies," according to the 
document.

<H3>  Joint statement on issues of export controls and policy in 
the area of transfers of conventional weapons and dual-use 
technologies </H3>
  [Text] The secretary of state of the United States of 
America 
and the minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation 
underscored the staunch commitment of their countries to efforts 
to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to 
enhance global and regional stability. In keeping with the 
spirit of the new strategic partnership between the United 
States and Russia the ministers have agreed on development of 
wide-ranging cooperation in the field of export control. 
Moreover, they have agreed that all necessary steps in this 
field be taken expeditiously, and have established a 
senior-level working group for this purpose, as well as to 
initiate bilateral cooperation in the areas specified in a 
memorandum of intent signed this day in Moscow. 
  The ministers expressed satisfaction with steps taken since 
the last meeting of the President of the United States and the 
president of the Russian Federation to eliminate the vestiges of 
the Cold War, such as the Coordinating Committee for 
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), which according to the 
understanding reached by COCOM members will be terminated not 
later than March 31, 1994. They also welcomed the decision to 
establish a new multilateral regime for enhancing responsibility 
and transparency in the transfers of armaments and sensitive 
dual-use technologies. This new arrangement would not be 
directed against any state or group of states, and would prevent 
the acquisition of such items for military end uses if the 
behavior of a state is or becomes a cause for serious concern as 
determined by the participants of the new multilateral regime. 
  The United States and Russia, as leading exporters of 
conventional weapons, military equipment and dual-use 
technologies, are convinced that additional measures are needed 
on an international basis to increase responsibility, 
transparency and, were appropriate, restraint in this area. 
They expressed their willingness to work with other countries 
in bringing about the early establishment of a new multilateral 
regime in order to achieve these objectives, which would 
supplement existing non-proliferation regimes, in particular 
through arrangements to exchange information for the purpose of 
meaningful consultations.

<F P=106> [Article by Pavel Felgengauer: "Choosing an Objective </F>
American Style"] 
  [Text] Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin have agreed that the 
strategic nuclear missiles of the United States and Russia will 
now be trained in not on the territory of the "probable enemy," 
but instead--on the empty regions of the world ocean. Now if 
something were to happen, the combined megatonnage of the two 
superpowers would merely slaughter fish and, perhaps, a couple 
of unfortunate fishermen. 
  This, of course, is a large step forward compared to Cold 
War 
times when, at the beginning of the eighties, on both sides of 
the ocean fingers were literally quivering over the launch 
buttons. The re-aiming of the strategic missiles was possibly 
the last in a long list of peaceful initiatives of Gorbachev, 
Reagan, and Bush, which made the beginning of the nineties quite 
different from the beginning of the eighties. 
  In this case, the initiative came from the American 
military. 
The Pentagon was concerned about reductions of staff and combat 
readiness in the Russian Army, about which there were many 
reports last year, and also the general crisis in our country, 
as a result of which, as they think there, there was a greater 
probability of unsanctioned or accidental launching of missiles. 
  The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs was happy to 
support 
the new peace initiative, and the Ministry of Defense and 
General Staff had no objections. The agreement was signed, but 
neither in the United States nor in Russia was there any 
possibility of monitoring compliance. All questions of 
controlling strategic nuclear forces (SYaS) are a carefully kept 
state secret. Nothing is known specifically--all one can do is 
guess. But one can assume with a certain amount of confidence 
that the Russian (Soviet) missiles were not aimed anywhere in 
particular anyway. There are various possible versions of their 
application and, correspondingly, a set of flight assignments. 
The order to launch and, correspondingly, the number of the 
flight assignment come from Moscow at the same time, and the 
team on duty in the underground command point in a standard 
situation does not participate in the launch at all. It merely 
echoes the commands from Moscow in the event of a possible 
failure of the electronic system, but itself can launch nothing 
without an order from Moscow granting permission. 
  When a year and a half ago President Yeltsin spoke about the 
fact that our missiles were not aimed at the cities of England 
and the United States, he undoubtedly spoke the truth, although 
in the West they did not really understand this ("Where are they 
aimed, then??!") Probably for the Americans aiming the missiles 
in a different direction really could serve as an additional 
safeguard against an accidental nuclear war. But since the 
majority of Americans, particularly the military--patriots of 
their homeland--are firmly convinced that the American way of 
solving any problem is the best, they are thus convinced that 
our equal triad of strategic nuclear forces is more or less a 
copy of their triad. Which in reality is far from the case. 
Frequently, fundamentally different technical and 
military-political solutions were used in the Soviet Union. 
  The most reliable thing would probably be for our presidents 
to simply take and exchange nuclear buttons, and thus put an end 
to the threat of nuclear war once and for all. Incidentally, the 
already mentioned differences in the organization of strategic 
nuclear forces could make sure that this exchange would not be 
altogether equivalent, either. It has long been known that what 
is good for the Russian is good for the German (or, say, the 
American).... Or, as Sir Kipling wrote: "East is East and West 
is West, and never the twain shall meet."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Chubarov and </F>
Denis Perkin] 
  [Text] Moscow January 21 TASS -- Ukrainian agreement to 
dismantle and store nuclear warheads from SS-24 missiles within 
ten months is one of the few results of the 
Russian-Ukrainian-U.S. negotiations, President of the National 
Security and International Relations Center Sergey Rogov told a 
briefing here today. 
  Rogov criticized the agreement, saying "commentaries 
claiming 
the tripartite statement on nuclear arms removes all problems 
related to nuclear weapons stationed on Ukrainian territory are 
too hasty". 
  In his words, the major drawback of the document is that it 
is not concrete. It carries no schedule of nuclear arms 
withdrawal from Ukrainian territory. If there is no withdrawal 
before the conference on non-proliferation of nuclear arms due 
to be held in 1995, the international community will face 
serious problems in discussion of the Non-Proliferation Treaty's 
future and a possibility of its joining by China, Israel and 
North Korea, stressed Rogov. 
  Even if Ukraine withdraws 176 intercontinental ballistic 
missiles and 1,500 warheads declared in the statement, it will 
not be able to sign the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear 
arms. In the words of Rogov, Ukraine has another 670 nuclear 
warheads from air-based missiles and gravity bombs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Atomic Energy Minister V. Mikhaylov </F>
by Vladimir Gubarev; place, date not given: "Enthusiastic 
Uranium Deals. Clinton Has `Donated' $12 Billion to Russia" -- 
first two paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] The Moscow meeting between the presidents of the 
United States, Russia, and Ukraine has prompted a number of 
rumors. In Kiev Kravchuk's opponents are claiming that Russia 
"did well out of the uranium deal" whereas the Ukrainian 
president was "sold short." Some people in the United States 
are saying that Clinton "gave away" $12 billion to Russia -- 
this is the amount it is proposed to pay for uranium destined 
for U.S. nuclear electric power stations, which will be obtained 
from our nuclear warheads. Finally, "joyous" hopes have arisen 
in the Russian Government: The word there is that U.S. dollars 
will now come flooding into our country.... 
  I was keen to ask the following questions in an interview 
with Russian Atomic Energy Minister V. Mikhaylov: 
  Gubarev: How did Ukraine lose out by this deal? 
  Mikhaylov: The level of Ukraine's security has 
increased -- so in fact Ukraine has benefited. Some of the 
reprocessed uranium from the nuclear weapons will go back to 
Ukraine in the form of fuel rods for the reactors of nuclear 
power stations. You must bear in mind that an extremely 
critical situation has developed in Ukraine regarding weapons 
and their storage and servicing. The weapons which have been 
delivered to us are very dangerous--scheduled maintenance has 
not been carried out, nor have they been serviced. I will not 
beat about the bush, I am very worried by the weapons situation 
there--you simply cannot play around with nuclear warheads! It 
must be clearly understood: Ukraine cannot be a nuclear 
power--neither the technical nor any other conditions exist 
there. Moreover, if Russia were not a nuclear power, in present 
conditions we too would be unable to build weapons or to service 
them at the appropriate level.... Quite honestly, I do not 
understand how people can play political games with nuclear 
weapons. I am convinced that the agreement signed in Moscow has 
saved Ukraine from new "Chernobyls." 
  Gubarev: What have the Americans gained? 
  Mikhaylov: They have made several billion dollars 
on this contract. Basically, U.S. uranium-235 enrichment plants 
are defective. Compared with our plants, they are obsolete and 
the technology is substandard. Their enrichment plants are 
about 20 times less efficient than ours in terms of electricity 
consumption. Therefore the Americans are closing down their 
enterprises and our fuel is going to their nuclear electric 
power stations. Incidentally, there are approximately 100 
reactor units in the United States. The government is basically 
a "middleman" now, it is reselling our fuel for nuclear electric 
power stations. I think it will make about $3 billion on this 
contract. 
  Gubarev: What about Russia? 
  Mikhaylov: The contract benefits us. But not in 
the financial sense. First, the process of dismantling weapons 
is very expensive--according to expert estimates, it works out 
at $30,000-100,000. The arithmetic is simple, and therefore you 
can see that "fat profits" will not be coming our way.... But 
for me the important thing lies elsewhere: This contract 
enables us to maintain Russia's nuclear industry, retain our 
cadres, and keep our scientific centers. In addition, the world 
will become a safer place: There are currently too many weapons 
at nuclear storage facilities. I am telling you this in all 
seriousness, since all my life I have been involved in 
developing nuclear weapons.... But I would like to reassure our 
fellow citizens: There is quite enough uranium in Russia to 
fully ensure supply to our nuclear power industry and weapons 
complex for many decades to come.

Yuriy Dubinin, told Interfax. 
  "Further negotiations on this issue are required, to

or change the agreements reached at the highest level," he said. 
  With reference to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, 
Dubinin 
pointed out that "it can be resolved, and must be resolved, 
particularly from the point of view of care for the Fleet's 
personnel." "The ways to resolve this issue were determined at 
the highest level, and what remains now is to reach agreement on 
the order of implementing what was planned," he said. 
  The problems existing in relations between Russia and 
Ukraine 
"must not be driven into a corner; they must be resolved fairly, 
on the path of friendship and cooperation," the diplomat 
stressed. "Both nations want it," Dubinin said. Russia's 
Foreign Ministry believes that it is imperative to implement all 
the agreements reached earlier between Russia and Ukraine, he 
pointed out.

or change the agreements reached at the highest level," he said. 
  With reference to the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, 
Dubinin 
pointed out that "it can be resolved, and must be resolved, 
particularly from the point of view of care for the Fleet's 
personnel." "The ways to resolve this issue were determined at 
the highest level, and what remains now is to reach agreement on 
the order of implementing what was planned," he said. 
  The problems existing in relations between Russia and 
Ukraine 
"must not be driven into a corner; they must be resolved fairly, 
on the path of friendship and cooperation," the diplomat 
stressed. "Both nations want it," Dubinin said. Russia's 
Foreign Ministry believes that it is imperative to implement all 
the agreements reached earlier between Russia and Ukraine, he 
pointed out.

<F P=106> [Military observer Vladimir Klimov "Topical Commentary:" </F>
"Where Are Missiles Targeted?"] 
  [Excerpts] Hamlet's question "To be or not to be?" remains 
the main question of the day. I was surely not the only one to 
think so on learning that the Russian and U.S. presidents had 
announced the detargeting of strategic missiles in the Moscow 
declaration. 
  "For the first time since the beginning of the nuclear era 
our countries have stopped targeting missiles at each other," 
Major General Anatoliy Svetikov, deputy chief of the Strategic 
Rocket Forces Staff Directorate, believes. [passage omitted] 
  Yet the past is still with us. The following questions have 
arisen from there, from the alarming past: Is the retargeting 
of missiles and their return to their former condition possible 
and how long would this take? Let us allow the specialist, Maj. 
Gen. Svetikov, to speak: 
  "The process of introducing and scrapping missions operates 
on many levels and planes. It varies for different categories 
and types of missile. The scrapping of missions will depend on 
the principle chosen by the two countries' presidents. As 
regards resumption, I can say that as long as a missile is on 
alert status there is always a possibility of returning 
everything to its former place. How long will this take? Long 
enough, although the times vary for different categories and 
types of missile. I do not intend to talk about time periods 
but have singled out the most important thing: the 
implementation of the presidents' decision sharply reduces the 
threshold of a nuclear strike." 
  How nice it would be to put a period after such an 
optimistic 
conclusion and to exclaim joyfully "The End!" Alas, there is 
still a long way to go before the end; dreams about a complete 
ban on nuclear weapons still remain dreams. The nuclear danger 
comes not from across the ocean but from Russia's doorstep -- 
Ukraine. Its president pledged to transport nuclear warheads to 
us for dismantling. But some of them are already in a critical 
condition. 
  Yet again we have to talk of the unreasonableness of certain 
vociferous politicians. Specialists, foreseeing the 
complexities with missiles, made an agreement about centralized 
maintenance of them. But some Ukrainian deputies saw Moscow's 
evil hand in this too. The agreements, which did not need 
parliament's ratification, were blocked by it. We, they said, 
will overcome. 
  But how can routine inspection and maintenance work and the 
maintenance of missile complexes be undertaken when there are 
not enough resources or specialists? The result of the 
deputies' veto is the alarming technical condition of missiles 
in Ukraine. Following inspection, warheads were removed from 
some missile launchers which had simply become dangerous. 
  Hamlet's question has now crystallized over these missile 
silos. How will people answer it?

of the board of directors of the Russian-U.S. 
"Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energiya" joint venture, said that thanks 
to their cooperation "in the past 12 months we managed to sign 
nine commercial contracts for launching Western companies' 
satellites with the Russian `Proton' system. The total amount 
of the contracts exceeds $600 million." According to the 
general director, the cooperation with the partners, who have 
taken over the marketing of Russia's most powerful rocket in 
service and also the licensing of Western firms' space vehicles, 
enabled the center "fully to book the program of space launches 
till the year 2000 and to look to the future with optimism."

<F P=106> [Oleg Falichev article: "View of the Problem. The </F>
President's Eyes and Ears, or How the Missile Attack Early 
Warning System Operates Following the Breakup of the USSR" -- 
passages between slantlines published in boldface] 
  [Text] The top-secret missile attack early warning system 
[MAEW] was certainly assigned a special role among the strategic 
deterrence systems developed in the USSR during the Cold War 
years. Why? It provided the president, the country's 
military-political leadership, and the command of the branches 
of the Armed Forces with the information needed to adopt a 
definitive decision regarding the use of nuclear missile forces. 
That is, it can be said to have been in the direct sense of the 
word the eyes and ears of the country's leadership. 
  Today the Cold War is behind us. The Soviet Union does not 
exist. Many over-the-horizon [OTH] tracking stations, the basis 
of the MAEW, have ended up over the border. Lastly the 
geopolitical position of Russia itself has changed. How has all 
this affected the combat readiness of the system and the lives 
and service of the troops? 
  Here were are on the outskirts of Moscow. The trees are 
covered with snow. An outwardly unremarkable building, which 
has so to speak been legendary for many years. This is an MAEW 
command post, and no journalist has set foot inside it in its 
entire existence. 
  Inside the light is dim and the duty shift wear soft 
footwear. There are telephones to the defense minister and the 
chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff on 
the duty officer's desk.... Opposite stands a huge panel, the 
size of the screen at Moscow's "Rossiya" Movie Theater, 
indicating the operational situation, the movement of space 
objects, and the status and operation of OTH tracking stations 
tracking near-earth space, satellites in near-earth orbit, and 
all launches of carrier missiles that come within the zone of 
visibility.... Figuratively speaking, the key to our strategic 
security is here in this room.... 
  It is here that the alarming inscription suddenly flashes 
from time to time (for training purposes): "Stand by. Launch. 
Missile Attack." Whereupon it gives the launch site, the 
number of missiles, and where they are targeted.... This 
information automatically enters the special "Krokus" device 
which is then used to activate the "nuclear attache case" held 
by the country's president. At the same time it is accompanied 
by an audio signal, which was said to have irritated M. 
Gorbachev a great deal. This is said to have ended in the 
"Krokus" being rapidly removed from his office. 
  As for the people stationed at the command post day and 
night 
(the duty officer, the systems analysts, and officers in the 
analytical service...), throughout the Cold War they were 
destined to be the first to learn of the start of the nuclear 
apocalypse. Cynical as it sounds, their job is to anticipate 
nuclear war. 
  Information comes into the multicolored command post panel 
today from eight MAEW stations, five of them located abroad: in 
Ukraine (Mukachevo and Sevastopol), Azerbaijan (Mingechaur), 
Kazakhstan (Balkhash), and Latvia (Skrunde). They are still 
providing information, but what guarantee is there that it will 
not suddenly stop one fine day? 
  From KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's file. 
  The development and creation of OTH MAEW and space 
surveillance radars began in our country in the sixties at the 
USSR Academy of Sciences Radiotechnical Research Institute under 
the leadership of Academician A.L. Mints. The first "Dnepr" 
stations were deployed in Kazakhstan and Siberia, forming a 
tight radar barrier 5,000km long ensuring the accurate detection 
and tracking of space objects. During the seventies it proved 
possible to expand the radar field by including stations in the 
polar region, Latvia, and Ukraine. 
  A plan was then developed for total, continuous OTH coverage 
in the missile-vulnerable western, southwestern, southern, and 
northeastern sectors. At the same time work was also under way 
on a fundamentally new phased-array OTH radar station called 
"Daryal".... 
  As we can see, the system was progressively built in 
missile-vulnerable areas. Needless to say, at the time no one 
thought that the Union would break up and that the radar field 
erected would be bisected by the national borders of sovereign 
states. Or that they would de facto end up under Russia's 
"nuclear umbrella." However, now the question is this: Do the 
republics need these services today? And, if so, on what terms? 
If not, what is to be done with the stations? 
  Regrettably these are not idle questions, since there are 
still no clear accords in this sphere or clear prospects. 
Admittedly there is the Treaty on Collective Security signed by 
six CIS states. But "nothing is forever".... Remember the 
promises about the unified ruble, economic, and information 
area. What has happened to all that? Is it true that the 
future of these stations and maybe the future of the MAEW is 
today being decided not only in Moscow but also in the CIS 
nation states? 
  ...The Balkhash area, where an MAEW unit is stationed, 
greeted us with cold gusts of wind and snow. A strange building 
like a gigantic hut rose above the wild semidesert. 
  "Our new `Daryal' looks strange and, you'll agree, 
impressive," Colonel G. Kozlyuk, deputy commander for work with 
personnel, broke into my thoughts. "The only thing is that the 
construction workers and fitters are unable to hand it over. So 
at the moment we are working with a `Dnepr.'" 
  Vast sums of money at the old prices have been invested in 
the station -- around 1 billion rubles. It is a reliable 
radar. It has triple-redundant technological apparatus, several 
independent power sources, and space, radio, and facsimile 
communications.... It provides highly important information 
about ballistic missile launches, identifies objects during the 
booster phase of their flight path, and can instantly compute 
warheads' launch and landing sites as well as their flight 
time.... 
  "We provided backup for the `Soyuz-Apollo' flight and all 
flights from Baykonur and obtained information on `Ferret' [as 
transliterated], `Columbia,' and the shuttle," Colonel N. 
Buchuk, deputy commander for arms, said not without pride. 
  The MAEW has never given a false alarm regarding a missile 
attack (unlike its U.S. counterpart). But the "Dnepr's" have 
virtually outlived their service life, working continuously 
throughout this period. 
  It became clear that the almost complete new "Daryal" 
station 
is not at its best. 
  "Everything is vague now," Deputy Chief Designer Yu. Konkin, 
who leads a wretched life here now with an uncertain future, 
told me. "So it is not surprising if the equipment gradually 
gets neglected...." 
  Regrettably, signs of this neglect are already striking, to 
whit "explosive" old electric cable in the living quarters, 
empty shelves in the military trading store, the boarded-up 
windows of empty apartments, and the lack of clear guarantees 
for the officers that they will be provided with amenities in 
Russia.... Major General Yu. Kabakov, army deputy commander for 
rear services, involuntarily added to the picture by citing the 
following figure: "Compared with past conditions, supplies to 
our units in neighboring countries have dropped by around 40 
percent, although the tasks have remained the same." 
  The various restrictions on the movement of freight and 
property and the confusion over supplies represent another 
barrier. In terms of some categories the unit remains on 
Kazakhstan's payroll, whereas as far as others are concerned it 
has been transferred to the Ural Military District. 
Realistically at the moment the unit doesn't know whether it is 
coming or going. And virtually everything -- from uniform 
badges to pipes -- has to be brought by air from Moscow. You 
can imagine the kind of megabucks this costs, but there is 
evidently no other option at the moment. 
  Needless to say all this cannot fail to affect the people, 
their mood, and ultimately their attitude to their work. 
  It is becoming more and more difficult to get replacements 
for these units from Russia, Colonel Ye. Tokarev, head of the 
army cadre department, thinks. 
Nonetheless at the moment, we would stress, all this is only 
indirectly affecting the unit's combat readiness. A commission 
from the Center led by Major General V. Pronov, the formation's 
chief of staff, came here to work and pointed to the reliability 
of the whole complex. It investigated a great deal and set a 
great deal to rights, so to speak. The unit received good 
marks, but its status remains unchanged. "We have no future 
here...," one officer told me bluntly. 
  Why is that happening in our country? The people who have to 
"pull" the strategic installation out of the mire without 
receiving proper pay, in many respects through personal 
initiative and self-restraint, should be rewarded, but they 
"have no future." Why did we make such a mess of the identical 
installation in Krasnoyarsk, owing to then Foreign Minister E.A. 
Shevardnadze's, so to speak, tractability and under pressure 
from the Americans, and why are we now turning it into...a 
furniture factory? At a time when the United States has not 
just failed to mothball its long-range tracking radar in 
Greenland but has even modernized it and has absolutely no 
intention of cutting back its other stations. 
  From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA file: 
  The U.S. BMEWS ballistic missile early warning system is 
established and operating. It comprises three posts on 
Fylingdales Moor (Britain), in Thule (Greenland), and in Clear 
(Alaska), which have been modernized in recent years to enable 
the system to detect missiles at long range. This system uses a 
multifunctional Precision Approach Radar station comprising a 
"Safeguard" ABM defense system. During the eighties more 
powerful assemblies of the Pave Paws OTH stations were deployed 
on U.S. eastern and western seaboards and southern borders. The 
NORAD command post in Colorado Springs exercises operational 
control of the entire nuclear missile early warning system. 
  There is also a first-echelon tracking missile launches and 
engaged in nuclear burst fix acquisition -- five "IMEWS-2" 
artificial earth satellites in orbit at distances of 
30,000-40,000 km. This system still monitors the entire surface 
of our planet, including Russia and the CIS. And in spring 1993 
during the Western European Union's military and scientific 
conference the question was raised of creating a European ABM 
defense system (EUROWISAT) combined with similar U.S. systems. 
Its deployment is scheduled for the year 2005. 
  So the breakup of the Union cannot so far be said to have 
had 
any effect on the MAEW. But there are problems, as we can see. 
Above all, the question of the status of MAEW units abroad needs 
to be resolved most speedily. Regrettably, everything is not as 
easy as we would like. Kazakhstan, for instance, has a bone to 
pick with the Russian military over use of its airspace, 
fulfillment of customs regulations, etc. But that is not the 
main thing. Major General A. Kasymov, chief of the Main Staff 
of the Kazakhstan Armed Forces, gave his view of the problem as 
follows: "The question of the future of the MAEW unit is in my 
view linked to the question of Kazakhstan's accession to the 
1972 ABM Treaty. We know the Russian Federation's stance: 
People say that Kazakhstan cannot be a party to the treaty 
because it does not have the status of a nuclear state.... But 
this treaty must be reviewed today to take account of the 
opinions of states with elements of the strategic nuclear forces 
stationed on their territory It is therefore necessary to lay 
down new conditions for the creation of the `nuclear club,' 
either on a multilateral basis or on a bilateral basis with 
Russia. And to record these in a corresponding protocol like 
the Lisbon Protocol...." 
  S. Tyurin, Russian consul in Kazakhstan, is inclined to 
think 
that Russia should be quicker in making up its mind about the 
status of the MAEW military unit in Kazakhstan: "I am not a 
military man, but I believe that this unit is a very important 
installation, spearheading scientific and technical progress. 
And failure to pay attention to it will cause us a setback just 
like the earlier setback with Baykonur in terms of the space 
program. At the moment -- this is a fact -- the military are 
surviving here as best they can. You cannot describe them as 
occupiers, since their main weapon is radar equipment...." 
  Everyday material and technical difficulties are a minor 
misfortune. It is their uncertain status that is causing 
discord among the officers and the personnel. The republic has 
after all adopted a law laying down that anyone who does not 
apply for other citizenship by 1 March automatically becomes a 
citizen of Kazakhstan.... So you can understand their position. 
And, moreover, that of their wives and school-age children, who 
are not particularly enthusiastic about the need for mandatory 
study of the Kazakh language in local schools or about obtaining 
secondary education certificates here. Not to mention the fact 
that there are Kazakhstani security and prosecutor's office 
organs at the garrison.... Colonel General (Retired) Yu. 
Votintsev, one of the people who developed the MAEW system, 
believes that a sorry fate lies in store for these installations 
if the problems are not resolved. "The outdated 'Dnepr' 
stations will be able to operate for another two or three years, 
six years at most, and then the whole Commonwealth will be left 
without some of the most accurate means of detecting attacking 
missiles." However, owing to the dismantling of the Krasnoyarsk 
radar a gap has already formed in our OTH tracking systems in 
the northeast of the country. Therefore logic itself suggests 
that it is necessary to at least preserve what is left. 
  "The point is that the highly effective system only works 
when it receives information from all OTH tracking stations. It 
would therefore evidently be right for the MAEW to be not a 
national but a supranational system," Lieutenant General S. 
Sokolov, MAEW army commander, said. "But, naturally, with other 
CIS countries taking a shared financial part in running it." 
  The Main Staff of the Air Defense Troops takes a similar 
view. 
  "Whether we need this installation or not is not under 
discussion," Colonel General V. Smirnov, commander of the 
missile-space defense troops, said. "But, in order to resolve 
the problems arising there, an agreement is first needed on 
Russian-Kazakhstani military cooperation -- an agreement which 
is not yet in place." 
  Well, this would evidently be the optimum solution to the 
very difficult situation that has developed since the breakup of 
the USSR as far as preserving the MAEW installations is 
concerned. It is after all easy to destroy things -- something 
that we have repeatedly seen over the last few years -- but it 
is hard to create them. The MAEW embodied the best achievements 
of many generations' intellectual potential. And, however 
stable the world may be today, it was, is, and remains a crucial 
deterrent against the unleashing of a nuclear missile war. 
  A final point. A session of the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry Collegium was held recently. It analyzed the results 
of the Russian Federation's military cooperation with 
neighboring states and identified tasks for 1994. It was 
stressed that, as a result of joint work on the part of the 
Russian Federation Defense and Foreign Ministries, a 
normative-legal base has by and large been created for 
military-political and military-technical cooperation with the 
republics of the former USSR. It was pointed out at the same 
time that, in view of Russia's strategic interests in this 
sphere, there are still plenty of unresolved questions. 
  It only remains to hope that the necessary decisions on 
strategic arms will not be shelved. After all, the fate of the 
military and their relatives and friends depends on them. And 
ultimately the reliability of Russia's defense itself. 
  Nonetheless at the moment, we would stress, all this is only 
indirectly affecting the unit's combat readiness. A commission 
from the Center led by Major General V. Pronov, the formation's 
chief of staff, came here to work and pointed to the reliability 
of the whole complex. It investigated a great deal and set a 
great deal to rights, so to speak. The unit received good 
marks, but its status remains unchanged. "We have no future 
here...," one officer told me bluntly. 
  Why is that happening in our country? The people who have to 
"pull" the strategic installation out of the mire without 
receiving proper pay, in many respects through personal 
initiative and self-restraint, should be rewarded, but they 
"have no future." Why did we make such a mess of the identical 
installation in Krasnoyarsk, owing to then Foreign Minister E.A. 
Shevardnadze's, so to speak, tractability and under pressure 
from the Americans, and why are we now turning it into...a

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Dolinin "Reportage for This Issue": "`First Aid' </F>
for Missiles" -- first three paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] Hundreds of ballistic missiles "held" by the 
Strategic Missile Forces are on alert duty in Russia. Russian 
missilemen also have a headache over the launchers stationed in 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. They have plenty of trouble 
with this whole "nuclear missile business." 
  Missiles, which are packed full of electronics and fuel and 
have nuclear warheads, require constant surveillance and care, 
particularly in the event of the aging and the malfunctions 
which are making themselves felt increasingly clearly today, 
given the meager funding, depleted spare parts, tools, and 
accessories kits, the destroyed collaboration within the former 
Union, the customs obstacles.... 
  In these conditions specialists locally and at the 
operational-technical control center of the Strategic Missile 
Forces, which our correspondent visited, are operating a "first 
aid" system. 
  Operational-technical control centers appeared in the 
Strategic Missile Forces High Command and in missile large 
strategic formations and combined units several years ago. They 
proved their viability in auspicious times, and in the present 
times -- with universal shortages -- they have proved simply 
essential. 
  "Such a center in the Strategic Missile Forces High 
Command," 
Lieutenant General Vladimir Nikitin, deputy commander in chief, 
believes, "is the eyes and ears of the forces' leadership. Here 
measures are taken to rectify the simplest fault in missile 
hardware and, if necessary, major technical decisions are worked 
out." 
  The center itself is housed in small, well-equipped 
premises. 
Nothing here is superfluous. Showing me round his facility, Lt. 
Colonel Mikhail Poludnitsyn, the center's chief, drew attention 
to the alert-duty personnel's posts and the collective 
electronic panel. The latter highlights information on the 
faults which have arisen, down to each individual launcher, 
gives their characteristics, and shows the time of reinstatement 
of "indisposed" missiles and protection systems. All this is 
conveyed via a computer link to the display units of chiefs of 
directorates and services. 
  The alert-duty personnel are headed by Col. Yuriy Surnin, 
who 
is assisted by two Alekseys -- Captain Kotlyarevskiy and Senior 
Lt. Klychnikov. Col. Vladimir Bezgreshnov, preparing to take 
Surnin's place, unhurriedly bones up on the situation. 
Engineers are on duty round the clock, being operationally 
subordinate to the Strategic Missile Forces Central Command Post. 
  I asked Surnin to assess the condition of the missile 
armament and hardware over the past 24 hours. 
  "Twenty launchers (more than half of them outside Russia) 
required prompt [operativnyy] intervention," he said. "On one, 
for example, an instrument has failed." On this score he 
reported: Measures have been taken, and the instrument is being 
delivered to the launcher by courier from a store in one of the 
divisions. The alert-duty personnel knew the train's number and 
were monitoring the officer's time of arrival in the unit and 
the hardware's readiness to receive him. 
  "We strive for stability, operational efficiency, secrecy, 
and continuity in the center's activity," Lt. Col. Poludnitsyn 
emphasized. 
  This is achieved not only by constant alert duty but also by 
means of the planning meetings conducted on a daily basis by Lt. 
Gen. Anatoliy Perminov, chief of the Main Directorate for the 
Operation of Missile Armament, and on Saturdays by Lt. Gen. 
Vladimir Nikitin, deputy commander in chief, directly at the 
operational-technical control center 
  Invited to the meetings are leading specialists of main 
directorates and officers of the state technical supervision, 
communications, the motor vehicle service.... Such 
representation has entirely justified itself. This staff of 
professionals resolves all problems. It is only when these fall 
outside the competence of the deputy commander in chief that 
direct application is made to the commander in chief of the 
Strategic Missile Forces himself. 
  The Saturday conference at the center was held in a calm 
working regime, but you could sense the anxiety and inner 
tension of the people gathered there. There are quite a few 
problems in Russia, so it turned out, and things are still more 
difficult in the event of equipment malfunctions in Ukraine. 
There are more malfunctions in just two missile divisions there 
than in all the Missile Forces. Technical decisions on them 
have been worked out in good time, and the Ukrainian side has 
not rejected them; but it cannot implement them. There are not 
the material and financial means or even the fuel to enable the 
routine inspection and maintenance crews to travel to the 
launchers. 
  Problems also arise in the divisions in Kazakhstan. For 
example, instruments intended for the automated systems for the 
protection of nuclear weapons are not allowed through customs. 
Whether they like it or not, the "technical personnel" are also 
required to be diplomats and prepare requests to the Main 
Customs Administration. 
  On visiting the operational-technical control center I saw 
for myself that an unwritten law exists among the missilemen: 
Don't leave a missile until a malfunction has been rectified. 
Those on duty in the control center and those who work with a 
wrench directly in a combat position really are like "first aid" 
for nuclear missile weapons.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy report: "Russia Ready for Cooperation"] </F>
  [Text] Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense 
minister, received U.S. Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, who 
are visiting Russia, 5 January. During the conversation they 
touched on the state of and prospects for Russian-U.S. military 
cooperation. The increase in the intensity of ties in this 
sphere is indicated by the fact that last year there were 17 
major events related to establishing cooperation between the two 
states' armed forces and another 26 are scheduled for the coming 
year. 
  At the U.S. senators' request Army Gen. Pavel Grachev told 
them about the features of Russia's new military doctrine. In 
particular he stressed that it is no coincidence that there is 
no reference in the "Basic Provisions of Russian Federation 
Military Doctrine" to Russia not being the first to use nuclear 
weapons. First, the corresponding U.S., British, and French 
documents contain no such provision. Second, such a pledge on 
our part did not enable nuclear weapons to be regarded as a 
means of averting war and a factor for deterring a potential 
aggressor. 
  The Russian defense minister described Russia's attitude to 
the "Partnership for Peace" idea mooted by the United States by 
saying the following: "We are ready to support the idea insofar 
as it considers the security interests of all states without 
exception" and if it is based on an all-Europe rather than a 
bloc system of security. As we see it, Pavel Grachev pointed 
out, true partnership means developing political dialogue, 
regular consultations, and reaching agreed positions, and this 
activity may culminate in coordinated practical actions. Russia 
is ready for that kind of cooperation. 
  During the meeting they also discussed questions of 
cooperation in nuclear disarmament and housing construction for 
servicemen, in particular servicemen from the troops being 
withdrawn from Germany and the Baltic states. There was also a 
detailed discussion of Ukrainian and North Korean nuclear policy 
and Russia's view of these problems. 
  Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General 
Staff of the Russian Federation Armed Forces; Andrey Kokoshin, 
Russian first deputy defense minister; and, on the U.S. side, 
Thomas Pickering, U.S. ambassador to Russia, took part in the 
conversation. 
  It is somewhat symbolic that on the same day the Russian and 
U.S. defense ministers had their first conversation over the 
direct telephone line connecting the offices of the heads of the 
two countries' military departments. Henceforth it will be 
easier and quicker to resolve urgent "burning" problems. 
Another step has been taken toward developing military 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "$2,000 To Cut Up One Tank"] </F>
  [Text] Minsk -- The repair plant at Borisov, some 80 km 
outside Minsk, had almost shut down completely a week ago. 
There was no electricity. 
  So what's new?! This kind of thing happens in Belarus all 
the time: Many plants are standing idle or working at 
50-percent capacity. 
  But Repair Plant No. 140 in Borisov is a special plant. 
Special, because it is carrying out an extraordinary order: It 
is cutting up tanks and other combat equipment which Belarus has 
been instructed to destroy under the terms of the treaty on 
reducing arms in Europe. When the treaty was signed, Belarus 
was still Belorussia and the tanks were Soviet. But everything 
had changed when the treaty came into force, the main difference 
being that it was now up to Minsk, rather than Moscow, to pay 
for the tanks and their destruction. 
  Cutting up a tank is expensive. As Colonel Mikhail Volochko 
from the National Monitoring and Inspections Agency told me, 
$2,000 per tank is the bare minimum. But Belarus is committed 
to destroying 1,873 of them within 40 months of the treaty's 
coming into force, that is, by the beginning of 1996. 
  Minsk itself must find the money to destroy these tanks. 
There are no charity organizations, and no special funds are 
envisaged. So where is the money to come from? So far it has 
been provided by the Defense Ministry. From which sources? 
From the most "expendable": Those intended as allocations to 
meet the needs of officers and warrant officers, provide them 
with social facilities, and build them the most basic 
accommodations. 
  But the Defense Ministry's budget is not so much hovering on 
the brink: It is simply in a state of collapse. If the money 
had been available, under no circumstances would it have allowed 
the repair plant in Borisov to be shut down. It will be started 
up again, of course, as there is no alternative but to scrape 
together the necessary funds to cut another 102 tanks and 49 
armored vehicles into pieces by 12 January, as envisaged by the 
current stage in the implementation of the treaty. 
  "But what if the plan is not fulfilled? What will happen if 
these commitments are left hanging in the air?" I asked members 
of the military and politicians. "Will sanctions be applied to 
Belarus?" 
  No overt sanctions are envisaged, it was explained to me, 
although covert sanctions are a possibility: For example, an 
agreement on economic or commercial cooperation in which Minsk 
is particularly interested could suddenly, at the very last 
moment just before signing, be set aside "for final touches and 
adjustments." 
  The military and the Belarusian Foreign Ministry estimate 
that the republic needs at least $33 million if it is to honor 
the commitments to which the Soviet Union set its signature -- 
namely, to destroy tanks, armored personnel carriers, aircraft, 
and other military equipment -- within the deadline and to the 
standard set, that is, without prompting criticism from NATO 
inspectors and monitors. I repeat: This kind of money cannot 
be found in the republic budget, not even by making still more 
draconian public spending cuts. 
Hence the task to which, as Foreign Minister Petr Kravchanka 
told me, Belarusian diplomats are devoting paramount attention: 
The task of finding these $33 million. Where are they looking? 
Abroad mainly. 
  One would have thought nothing could be simpler: For 
example, the United States has long had a law named after its 
authors, Senators Nunn and Lugar, which provides for giving 
substantial aid to some of the former Soviet republics for the 
purpose of their demilitarization. Almost $800 million has been 
assigned, of which more than $70 million is due to Belarus. 
  But the problem is that this money is primarily "nuclear," 
that is, it is earmarked for nuclear demilitarization and 
actually has nothing to do with conventional weapons, such as 
tanks and armored vehicles. Nunn and Lugar are perfectly 
willing to allocate -- and are allocating -- $25 million to 
ensure the "environmental regeneration" of places in Belarus 
where strategic missile forces used to be stationed, but Minsk 
can go whistle as far as help with destroying tanks is 
concerned. Incidentally, I came across a very interesting 
report in a Minsk newspaper recently: A high-security 
corrective labor colony is opening on the site of a disbanded 
missile unit in Ivatsevichskiy Rayon. It will have room for 
2,000 prisoners. The report did not make clear, however, 
whether this is the "environmental regeneration" referred to in 
the Nunn-Lugar law, and, if it is, what sum the senators have 
allocated for this specific project. 
  It seems to me that this U.S. law and similar laws in other 
countries need some modifications and amendments. Obviously you 
must not look a gift horse in the mouth and so forth, but, if 
you think about it, it is probably far more important for 
Belarus to prevent the total breakdown of social programs for 
military servicemen at present than to implement in full and in 
a short space of time some of the provisions of nuclear 
demilitarization. Naturally, I am not suggesting any slowing 
down of pace, even the slightest, as far as the dismantling of 
nuclear warheads is concerned; in this regard, everything must 
go strictly according to schedule (for your information: 
Tactical nuclear weapons were removed from Belarus over a year 
ago, and 80 strategic missiles with 175 warheads remain). But 
it would certainly make sense to try to somehow rethink the 
secondary or tertiary elements in the demilitarization program: 
Either in terms of rearranging priorities or even in terms of 
putting resources to more economical use. 
  People in Belarus are grumbling. Military and civilians 
alike. Some quite openly, others in private or in Aesopian 
terms, because of their statutory obligations. They are 
grumbling about the fact that demilitarization is being 
implemented not just rigidly, but sometimes even inanely. It is 
ironic that the Soviet Union's economy was killed by 
militarization, while the post-Soviet republics' economy is 
being strangled by the reverse process. If the situation in the 
Belarusian economy were just a little better than it is now -- 
people do not leave the repair plant in Borisov, which used to 
be considered a prestigious establishment but now stands idle 
more and more often, simply because there is nowhere to go (many 
other plants are closed indefinitely) -- the reaction to the 
need for Belarus to honor its international commitments would be 
different, more understanding. 
  There is no doubt that the weapons in question must be 
disposed of, especially those which were dumped in Belarus by 
the previous power, which never troubled to find out the opinion 
of Belarus and its people. But perhaps it would be worth 
thinking about ways to ensure that the demilitarization process 
does not kill the economy before it has a chance to stand on its 
own feet and move in the direction of a real market system and 
that the disarmament of Belarus does not lead to social 
upheavals? Of course, if the $33 million are found, or even $20 
million, it will be much easier. But if not? In that case, it 
would certainly be worth raising the question of postponing the 
destruction of weapons and spreading the schedule over several 
months or even over a year or so. In what, ultimately, does the 
West have a vested interest? In a country crushed by the weight 
of its economic problems, but with not a single superfluous tank 
left exactly 40 months from now and not a day later? Or in a 
country with a more or less acceptable economy and, 
consequently, political stability, but with a superfluous 
200-300 armored vehicles, which will nevertheless be cut into 
pieces, albeit not immediately, but after a small delay? 
  The fact that Belarus takes extremely seriously the 
commitments made on its behalf by others is not in any doubt. I 
think this is partly the reason why only Minsk, apart from 
Moscow, features on the itinerary of President William Clinton's 
forthcoming visit to the former Soviet Union in January. 
  But the United States is not top of Belarus' list of foreign 
policy priorities. Russia comes first. This is clear from a 
draft of the republic's basic foreign policy concepts, a 
document which must be discussed in the Supreme Soviet in the 
very near future. At the moment, it is stamped "secret," the 
point of which no one I spoke to could explain, apart from one, 
perhaps, who said: "If the discussion were conducted openly and 
broadcast live, we would distract and agitate people. Then 
parliamentarians could say such slanderous things about other 
countries during the debates that it would cause a scandal." 
  I did nevertheless manage to find out something about the 
secret document's contents. First, the list of priorities. It 
is as follows: Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, 
Germany, the United States, France, Britain, Italy, Austria, 
Scandinavia, China, India, Japan, and the gas- and 
oil-extracting CIS countries. I was told that, a year ago, the 
Supreme Soviet would not have placed Russia at the top of the 
list: Europe would have been there instead. Second, the 
document confirms the provision of the Belarusian Constitution 
which states that the Supreme Soviet determines the direction 
taken by foreign policy and adopts decisions on fundamental 
issues. This means that the government and, in particular, the 
Foreign Ministry are assigned a subsidiary role. 
  Be that as it may, the draft of the basic concepts has in 
fact survived all the various stages of coordination and 
agreement, including in the diplomatic department, which has not 
bothered to kick up a fuss about the Supreme Soviet being 
allowed to call the shots. Why not? Probably because, as the 
Foreign Ministry and the Supreme Soviet itself realize perfectly 
well, this document is "short-lived," designed to last one or 
two years at most. Also, in a situation where, to quote Ivan 
Tereshko, chairman of the Supreme Soviet International Affairs 
Commission, "we are simply flying headlong," there is no point 
thinking about something more permanent and stable or drawing up 
long-term foreign policy concepts. 
  But the document does have one obvious positive quality: It 
must defuse the tension which has developed around the Foreign 
Ministry in the last 12-18 months and which has manifested 
itself, in particular, in relations with the Supreme Soviet 
leadership; relations marked, as one can judge from reports of 
parliamentary debates, by accusations and counteraccusations of 
unprofessionalism, incompetence, and lack of preparation; 
relations giving cause to say -- as Zenon Poznyak, leader of the 
opposition in parliament, did say in a conversation with me -- 
that "Belarus has no foreign policy as such." 
  I am convinced of the opposite: Belarus certainly does have 
a foreign policy. A foreign policy with very clear guidelines 
and objectives, which is particularly important. This is 
evident even from the list of priorities, which does not feature 
abstract discussions about common human values, but the specific 
interests of Belarus itself, which is striving to understand 
what is happening in the countries closest to it, as it is there 
that its interests are affected in a direct and powerful way. 
  Even when Repair Plant No. 140 in Borisov, deprived of 
electricity, will get back on its feet....

  [Text] Minsk, 14 January -- The latest round of destruction 
of armoured military equipment, which Belarus is destroying in 
accordance with the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in 
Europe, has begun at the Borisov tank maintenance plant. This 
has been verified by a NATO military inspection from the Kingdom 
of Belgium, in which experts from the other states of the North 
Atlantic alliance were also represented, as is customary. 
Foreign monitors inspected and counted up all the equipment due 
for destruction between 13 January and 24 February. More than 
90 tanks and about 50 infantry fighting vehicles will be cut up 
for scrap and partially re-equipped as vehicles for use in the 
national economy.

<F P=106> [Report by BELAPAN correspondent Ales Lipay: "Dollars for </F>
Nuclear Weapons"] 
  [Text] Belarusian Foreign Minister Petr Krawchanka has 
confirmed in an interview with BELAPAN that the issue of 
compensation for uranium recovered from nuclear warheads 
transferred from Belarus to Russia remains in the "process of 
negotiations," in which five states are participating. 
  When the media, noted P. Krawchanka, report that such 
compensation will total $12 billion, I laugh at such 
dilettantism. This is a sum which must be divided between four 
CIS countries. However, it will not be paid at one time, but 
rather over the course of several years. Today, it is even hard 
to say when the United States will begin to buy the uranium from 
Russia, added the minister.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Akimov and Amangeldiy </F>
Akhmetalimov] 
  [Text] Almaty January 31 TASS -- The foreign minister of 
Kazakhstan denied allegations that his country is revising its 
nuclear-free status and said republican authorities will probe 
all circumstances which led to a publication in the Iranian 
"JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI" newspaper which said that the Central Asian 
republic will not give up its nuclear arsenal. 
  "This is a newspaper canard which does not deserve any 
attention," Tuleutay Suleymenov said on Monday. 
  The newspaper quoted Kazakh Ambassador in Tehran Myrzatay 
Dzholdasbekov as saying that Kazakhstan does not intend to 
eliminate or relocate its nuclear weapons to any other place 
until non-use of such weapons is guaranteed at the world level 
and the planet gets rid of them. 
  It was stressed that this was the official position which 
was 
to be conveyed to the U.S. Administration during a visit of 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev to the United States which is to 
take place in two weeks. 
  Kazakhstan "joined the nuclear non-proliferation treaty last 
December and ratified it, as well as the Start I treaty," 
Suleymenov said adding that instruments of ratification will be 
exchanged with the United States during the visit of Nazarbayev 
in mid-February. 
  "Moreover, Kazakhstan together with Belarus made a 
considerable contribution to the work which was completed in 
Moscow by Presidents of Russia, the United States and ukraine," 
Suleymenov said referring to the trilateral agreement according 
to which Ukraine gives up its nuclear weapons. 
  "Our republic never strived to be a nuclear state. It has 
experienced its deadly danger. Five hundred nuclear tests have 
been conducted at the Semipalatinsk range which is closed now. 
Hundreds of thousands of Kazakhs are still suffering from their 
aftermath and we all view disposing of the weapons as a 
benefit," the minister said. He added that Kazakh official 
authorities are trying to probe all the circumstances which 
resulted in the publication in "JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI" which "rudely 
distorted the republican position on nuclear weapons." Most 
evidently, the newspaper is guilty of wishful thinking, but it 
is not ruled out that the words of the ambassador were distorted 
for some reason.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Ladin report under the "Events and Commentary" </F>
rubric: "Will Nuclear Charge Be Left to Our Descendants as a 
Memento? Semipalatinsk Test Site Continues To Pose Questions"] 
  [Text] At a meeting between Tulegen Zhukeyev, state 
counselor of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and journalists 
discussion again turned to the future of a nuclear device 
prepared for testing at the Semipalatinsk test site but still in 
an underground gallery, as the test site has been closed to date 
under an edict of the president of Kazakhstan. Nuclear tests 
have accordingly ended. 
  What, then, will become of the nuclear charge? What is its 
future? Could a spontaneous underground nuclear explosion 
eventually occur? These and other questions are worrying people. 
  The state counselor thinks the nuclear charge should be 
neutralized. However, according to him, Kazakhstan is unable to 
do this itself. Only those who prepared the charge and placed 
it underground for testing are capable of doing it. 
  However, as we have learned from informed sources, the 
nuclear charge's removal from the gallery entails very 
complicated engineering operations. This is not only expensive, 
it is dangerous too, as it was never planned that the device 
would be removed. It was prepared only for detonation and was 
carefully sealed up. 
  We have heard from certain officers at the test site that 
destroying the charge in situ would be the simplest and most 
expedient solution. That is to say, detonate it and let that be 
an end to the matter, particularly as its yield compared with 
those detonated at the test site in previous years is not very 
great. 
  But a new problem is coming to a head. The military unit 
which provided support services for tests at the Semipalatinsk 
site is being disbanded. Shortly there will be no one to remove 
or detonate the charge, depending on which decision is made. 
Perhaps our descendants will be left this "surprise" as a 
keepsake?

<F P=106> [From the "M-Trust" program: Video report by unnamed </F>
correspondent; figures in brackets denote broadcast time in GMT 
in hours, minutes, and seconds] 
  [Excerpts] [131957] [Correspondent over aerial shot of 
region] In December, on the eve of the New Year, the 
governments of Russia and Kazakhstan finally decided on a way of 
preserving the vital operational capacity of the unique Baykonur 
Space Center complex. A recent press conference held at the 
Russian Space Agency was devoted to explaining the problems 
which have beset the multibillion industrial and scientific 
giant's 40-year history, and which are set to dog its present 
and its future. Baykonur started out as an isolated entity deep 
in the steppe heartland. Today, however, it is a whole state 
comprising impressive constructions, power-consuming plants, 
assembly buildings, and the city of Leninsk. Alongside the 
complex's famous No. 2 launchpad, the starting point for 
satellite launches, Gagarin's spaceflight, and indeed that of 
the cosmonauts currently in orbit -- that is, alongside this 
living legend other launchpads have been constructed, including 
sites for the Proton and Energiya rockets. Many kilometers of 
cable worth billions of rubles have been invested in this site. 
And state-of-the-art technology is used in the rockets, the 
payloads, in work carried out in orbit, and in the help 
proffered from Earth. So Baykonur's separation from Russia's 
multifaceted space sector would result in a loss of resources 
and a dissipation of personnel and profitable contracts. The 
point being that the new super-complex being developed on the 
basis of Plesetsk is going to take between eight and 10 years to 
build. [passage omitted] 
  [132204] [Correspondent resumes over video of servicemen 
sitting on a bench] At the moment, Baykonur keeps going 
basically by dint of the fact that 28,000 Russian servicemen are 
there to operate it. For this reason it is hard to imagine any 
kind of commercial mechanism succeeding, be it a firm or a 
corporation. Frankly, to totally demilitarize Baykonur and 
replace military with civilian experts overnight would spell 
disaster. And talk of generating sufficient revenue on site for 
the giant Baykonur-Leninsk complex to pay its own way is little 
short of ridiculous. Russia is going to rent the entire complex 
from Kazakhstan, financially compensate for the ecological 
damage, and clear the 400,000 hectares of proving ground of 
scrap metal. However, this will not entail the billions of 
dollars which are being alluded to but will be done with due 
consideration for the overall state of accounts between Russia 
and Kazakhstan. Finally, at a time when 37 percent of Russia's 
space budget goes on maintaining the Mir space station, our 
participation in the new international space project -- the 
"Alpha" Station -- will create new jobs for tens of thousands of 
people and a billion dollars in profits in the next four years 
alone. Not to mention the production of new spacesuits in 
conjunction with the Germans, and of collapsible modules for 
India -- in fact, contracts have been concluded with 20 states 
in all. And all this represents technology, profit, and 
prosperity. [132210] [Video shows shots of Baykonur,

  [Text] According to information from an informed source, 
the prospects for locating a U.S. Air Force base in Kyrgyzstan 
within the framework of NATO are being studied at state level in 
the republic. In support of this account is the lively exchange 
of visits last year by NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, 
former State Defense Committee Chairman Dzhanybek Umetaliyev, 
and other high-ranking officials. The projected base's location 
is for the moment being kept secret. Lieutenant Colonel A.

  [Text] Kiev -- Speaking to a UNIAN correspondent, a 
representative of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense press centre 
denied Russian media reports (particularly those by ITAR-TASS 
and Ostankino) about Ukrainian-Russian military consultations in 
Kiev on the future fate of the nuclear arms deployed on the 
territory of Ukraine, allegedly due to start on 5 January with 
the participation of Defense Ministers Vitaliy Radetskyy and 
Pavel Grachev. "The Ministry of Defense did not plan for such a 
meeting on 5-6 January," the press centre representative said. 
He added that work is in progress on preparations for a 
bilateral agreement on military cooperation, and 
Ukrainian-Russian military consultations on the issue were 
already held on 28-29 December in Moscow. According to an 
earlier UNIAN report, the Ukrainian delegation was led by Deputy 
Minister of Defense Ivan Oliynyk. 
  In the view of a high-ranking Ministry of Defense 
representative who would not give his name, a meeting of 
Ukrainian and Russian defense ministry delegations on the 
nuclear arms issue will be possible only after the problem is 
discussed by the presidents of both countries, or at least by 
government delegations.

  [Text] A briefing was held today at the Ukrainian Foreign 
Ministry in Kiev. Commenting on the possibility of signing any 
final document on eliminating nuclear arms on Ukrainian 
territory during the talks in Moscow between the U.S., Russian, 
and Ukrainian presidents -- as hastily reported by Ostankino 
Television -- and on a bilateral meeting between the Ukrainian 
and U.S. presidents, Yuriy Serheyev, chief of Foreign Ministry 
Information Department, in particular said: 
  [Begin Serheyev recording] As of today, I cannot say that a 
final document has already been drafted; I cannot say what form 
this document will take. That is why the scheduled tripartite 
conference in Moscow may have any form. If the final [draft] of 
the document is not completed, the Moscow conference is likely 
to be of consultative nature and aimed at coordinating aspects 
which still need to be coordinated. If the Moscow meeting 
manages to resolve uncoordinated issues, the document should 
take some form. I want to draw your attention to [word 
indistinct] commentaries, or I would rather say biased 
commentaries regarding the translation of Mr. Gore's statement 
which can be interpreted as an agreement or a treaty. As you 
see, at this stage, it is better to speak about a document 
rather than agreement or treaty. 
  [Serheyev continues] Discussions over the form and essence 
of this document are still continuing, in Ukraine's governing 
circles as well. I want to stress that the Moscow summit will 
be preceded by a short meeting in Kiev. The possibility and 
likeliness of such a meeting were discussed very thoroughly 
through diplomatic channels. I also want to point out that as 
stated in yesterday's declaration by the Council of Ministers' 
and presidential press service, the main theme of the meeting 
will be the discussion of a wide range of issues concerning 
bilateral relations. This is very essential. Moreover, this 
statement is not unilateral; it was coordinated. There is a 
mutual desire on both sides to discuss bilateral relations at 
this meeting. This is not a bad example and not a bad result 
demonstrating that prospects are opening for a more constructive 
dialogue and more constructive relations with the United States 
in the spheres discussed in the course of Mr. Christopher's 
visit to Kiev. In particular [we should] balance our relations, 
direct them into the stream of military-political cooperation, 
and in the first place, economic cooperation. This visit once 
again emphasizes the attention paid Ukraine and importance of 
developing bilateral relations with her. Naturally, in the 
course of the [Kiev] meeting, issues tackled in Brussels and 
those to be tackled in Moscow will be discussed. [end recording]

  [Text] Kiev, 11 Jan -- Anatoliy Shybiko, deputy chairman of 
the Ukrainian Republican Party, noted in an interview with a 
UNIAR correspondent that without having in front of him the 
agreement on liquidating Ukraine's nuclear arsenal and without 
understanding its point, it would be premature to give a 
preliminary assessment of this agreement. In his opinion, a 
final assessment of the agreement should be given only after a 
text of the agreement between Ukraine, Russia, and the United 
States becomes available. Mr. Shybiko is deeply convinced that 
Ukraine should remain a nuclear state for the near future and 
should accede to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons as a nuclear state.

  [Text] Kiev january 12 TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk confirmed that he would fly to Moscow to sign on Friday 
an agreement with Russia and the United States which will oblige 
Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons inherited from the former 
Soviet Union. 
  "Ukraine will carry out its obligations and will not stand 
in 
the way of nuclear disarmament," Kravchuk told a press 
conference on Wednesday after talks with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton. 
  The U.S. President stressed that the Ukrainian decision to 
become nuclear free opens wide prospects for it in getting 
economic aid from various international financial institutions. 
  The "Partnership for Peace" plan provides Ukraine with a 
possibility to cooperate with the armed forces of the United 
States and NATO which will also promote Ukrainian security, 
according to Clinton. 
  The agreement will enhance the security of the three parties 
and the entire world, Clinton said. 
  Kravchuk thanked the U.S. President for his active promotion 
of cooperation between the two countries.

<F P=106> [News conference by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk with </F>
unidentified reporters in Kiev on 14 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] Reporter: Can you say if the document 
that was signed by the three presidents in the Kremlin today 
will have to be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament? Will it 
help resolve the issue of disarmament in general, both in Europe 
and on CIS territory? Is this primarily a new step or not? 
Third, to what extent will it help Ukraine's economy? 
  Kravchuk: The document is a continuation of the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council resolutions. If you recall, the 
reservations that it put forth were about compensation for 
tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, their technical 
maintenance, financial and technical aid, and [security] 
guarantees. These, approximately, were the main reservations of 
the Supreme Council. When you read that document, and it will 
be published, you will find that all of those demands were met. 
In other words, we can positively state that the executive 
branch has not been acting contrary to the Supreme Council 
resolutions but acting toward fulfilling the reservations put 
forth by the Supreme Council. I would like to emphasize this 
fact so that no one thinks, as some try to imply, that the 
president and the parliament were following their own separate 
courses. We did satisfy the reservations. I said in the past 
-- and I am confirming it now -- that we must join the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. This is my deep conviction, because 
everyone has already joined it -- Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, 
and 131 countries. This is a normal step for Ukraine. This is 
why I hope that when we inform our parliament about our actions 
since December... [pauses] a very difficult time for Ukraine, 
which had to withstand pressure from all over the world. Not 
everyone understood our steps, not everyone understood our 
actions and there were grounds for this. This, I think, is a 
matter of principle. Now about your question as to who this 
document will serve. Both the talks with the U.S. President in 
Kiev and the trilateral talks have confirmed one irrefutable 
truth -- problems can be resolved only on the path of 
compromises and agreements. No reservations, no guarantees 
expressed in documents or agreements or declarations or anything 
else will be realized if one or another state follows the policy 
of confrontation instead of compromise. If, for instance, 
Ukraine... [pauses] now they say that Ukraine has been brought 
to its knees. This is absurd. First, Ukraine has come out of 
the situation with credit. We will be compensated and given 
assistance; we will be respected politically and in other ways. 
If we had opposed the adopted course and stood in the way of 
nuclear disarmament -- and it was anticipated -- if Ukraine had 
failed to fulfill its obligations, it would have blocked the 
further development of nuclear disarmament. It would have 
blocked it. START II depends on the resolution of the START I 
issue. I hope that there will be START III as well, and the 
final goal will be achieved in the total dismantling of nuclear 
weapons on our planet. Thus, Ukraine, having resolved this 
issue, unblocked nuclear disarmament for the whole world, for 
all of humanity. By taking this step Ukraine testified to the 
fact that there are no separate paths for Ukraine -- it follows 
the path of civilization and all human interest. This is the 
main issue for all the European and world community. By taking 
this step we have raised Ukraine's political prestige and image, 
we have confirmed that Ukraine's policies are predictable. 
[passage omitted] 
  Reporter, HOLOS UKRAYINY newspaper: Leonid 
Makarovych, I have a question. The answer to it concerns many 
people: Will our state's national security be consolidated 
after today's signing [of the trilateral agreement]? If so, 
what changes for the better can be expected? 
  Kravchuk: It will be consolidated in the following 
aspect: We have already experienced a completely different 
attitude toward Ukraine--from Russia, for example. You have 
seen a different attitude toward us by the United States during 
the U.S. President's visit. I also have reports that NATO 
countries have come to understand Ukraine after receiving the 
bit of information which we still have to think over today. 
This way, the international environment and our neighbors have 
accepted Ukraine as a state that does not want evil but wants to 
live in friendship, partnership, and cooperation with other 
countries. This is the first point. Second, you understand 
that it is an illusion to say that the weapons we have owned 
were a deterrent. I have already told you about this 
deterrence; this is just a danger of deterrence rather than the 
deterrent [as received]. Because we are unable to produce, 
operate, restore, or service them--because we have nothing: 
neither industry nor testing grounds--what kind of deterrence 
can we talk about? This is an illusion of deterrence, but it 
was hammered into people's heads. The weapons have not been a 
guarantee of security, but a source of threat--and not only to 
Ukraine. This way, having won support from certain people and 
states, including powerful states, we have obtained security. 
Security does not mean signed documents. You know how many 
pacts have already been signed in history, how many other 
documents have been signed. However, they have been 
insufficient because a state policy has been against what has 
been signed. We want our policy to be implemented in real 
terms, in line with our civilized and anticipated concept, which 
has been approved. I am convinced that we have obtained 
security and opened the path to economic cooperation. We have 
also achieved a state's image. We have acted in line with our 
Supreme Council, and I am convinced that the majority of the 
people of Ukraine want this. 
  Reporter: At the recent news conference with 
Moldovan President Snegur you said something like this: The 
danger coming from the revanchist forces in Russia has 
increased. If such factors in the policy of our neighbor 
dominate, how do you think the signed agreement can be fulfilled 
and what mechanism of ensuring our national security do you see 
as the head of state? 
  Kravchuk: Well, first, I said this a little 
differently. I said I felt anxiety. [sentence indistinct] 
However, the words danger and anxiety have subtle differences 
in connotation. Danger means that this is somewhere here... 
[pauses] As far as anxiety is concerned, it is known to me, and 
every person must feel it when complicated processes are under 
way. However, I will repeat that this is not a state policy but 
a political trend. Political trends have occurred in history, 
you know about that. Let us take the last 300 years, and we 
will find different trends in all spheres of social life: 
spiritual and political spheres, and this is a normal democratic 
phenomenon. However, such a tendency must not become a state 
policy. To prevent this, we must cooperate first of all with 
Russia. There are 205 million of us in Russia and Ukraine. 
Difficult processes are under way in our country too. One 
should not attribute them only to Russia. They are everywhere. 
Revanchists, nationalists, national patriots reveal themselves 
everywhere; they are coming out, because such is the time now. 
Let us prevent them from standing in the way of progressive 
development. This is a democratic way. However, to prevent this 
from becoming a state policy is our responsibility and our 
common concern. When we say that we have signed an agreement by 
three presidents today, this speaks volumes. Normal cooperation 
begins from this point: politically, economically, and 
spiritually. Those forces that today are in opposition will 
remain there. Opposition must exist, and there is nothing scary 
about this. However, one must not allow aggressiveness, and 
antipeople, antihumanitarian moods, hidden under patriotism, to 
dominate in society. We must not allow this. That is to say, I 
feel anxiety but I also have hope, because 14 January is a new 
page of understanding our problems, and a page comprised of new 
steps. I believe that these steps are aimed against what makes 
all of us apprehensive.

"Kravchuk and Clinton Reach Agreement. Uncertain How Ukrainian 
Parliament Will Act"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- "Temporary inconvenience equals improvement 
forever," Bill Clinton and Leonid Kravchuk gave a press 
conference next to this promising poster, which does, 
admittedly, pertain to repair work at Borispol Airport. 
  According to Leonid Kravchuk, this brief visit is as 
valuable 
as a long one. Bill Clinton said that the three countries' 
presidents are ready to sign an agreement on Friday that will 
commit Ukraine to eliminate the 176 ICBM's and around 1,500 
nuclear warheads targeted against the United States and open up 
new forms of cooperation in the economy, politics, and security. 
"Let me give credit to President Kravchuk for his statesmanlike 
way of thinking and his guidance in reaching this accord," he 
said. 
  However, the credit still has to be given: The U.S. 
President promised that he would take care to ensure that 
Ukraine receives most speedily the proper compensation for the 
tactical nuclear weapons that have already been taken to Russia 
and, in addition, that Ukraine gets a considerable amount of 
money for dismantling the weapons -- money that can be used for 
defense and conversion. The United States pledged to help 
Ukraine during the difficult period of its transition to a 
market economy. In Kiev Clinton announced the creation of an 
enterprise support fund for Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus. 
  Ukraine's participation in the "Partnership for Peace" will 
provide additional guarantees that it can cooperate with the 
U.S. Armed Forces and with NATO countries, and Ukraine's 
decision to become a nuclear-free state will make it possible 
for it to obtain economic aid from the World Bank, the IMF, the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the G-7 
countries. 
  "I believe that Ukraine cannot be confident of its security 
in the 21st century unless it is strong economically," Bill 
Clinton said. 
  The Ukrainian president decided to act without recourse to 
the parliament, which not so long ago even had a fair number of 
complaints to make about the START-I Treaty. "Philosophers say 
that everything in the world is changing and that you cannot 
step into the same river twice," Leonid Kravchuk said. "It is 
the same with the parliament: I hope that it will understand 
the crux of this global problem facing the world, the crux of 
our relations, and given the three states' mutual desire we will 
fulfill our commitments with its support." 
  The last session of the current Supreme Council next week 
could upset this: The accusation of "disarming" Ukraine is one 
that many people respond to, particularly during an election 
campaign. During Clinton's visit the youth faction of the 
People's Rukh demonstrated at the airport with the Ukrainian 
Students' Union. Boys stood under banners proclaiming "Careful, 
Clinton: First Crimea, then Alaska"; "Bill, would you disarm if 
you were in the same cage as a Russian bear?"; and "All Missiles 
to Zhirinovskiy?" 
  The last question is of interest to many Ukrainian 
inhabitants -- it may be cleared up by the three president's 
meeting in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F>
Stanislav Prokopchuk; place, date not given: "Leonid Kravchuk: 
Let's Take Account of Today's Realities"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage on social problems, economy omitted] 
  Prokopchuk: By ratifying START I and the Lisbon 
Protocol with a number of substantial provisos did Ukraine not 
doom itself to a further, tighter credit blockade and 
uncompromising political pressure from the United States and 
other nuclear states? 
  Kravchuk: The Supreme Council decree includes 
provisos which are perfectly normal and natural, as they say. 
Yes, Ukraine is entitled to compensation for its nuclear 
weapons, Ukraine must have reliable guarantees of its security, 
Ukraine needs assistance to eliminate its nuclear weapons. 
  But the fact that the Supreme Council did not vote to join 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is a major mistake by our 
parliament. I have said and will continue to say this, I will 
insist that the only correct path for us is to join the treaty. 
We cannot change the already adopted course toward nuclear-free 
status. You can build any illusions you like, even about 
creating our own nuclear industry, but they are only illusions. 
It is clear to everyone that we do not need the weapons we 
inherited from the USSR. And nobody will ever use them. 
  Everybody knows that, even if such an insane idea was to 
come into somebody's head, it is practically impossible today 
for Ukraine to launch the missiles. Any of these 176 missiles 
can be launched only on orders from Moscow. This is clear to 
everyone, but nevertheless attempts continue to be made to turn 
us into a bogeyman. 
  In signing the trilateral statement and the annex to it in 
Moscow on 14 January, Ukraine won a political, economic, and 
human victory. The United States, Russia, and the entire world 
community shared it with us. Nobody will now say that Ukraine 
is standing still on the nuclear disarmament road. The road to 
START II and even START III is now open. Mankind has gained 
real hope of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. 
  There is something else I also wish to stress. Most of the 
demands formulated in the Ukrainian Supreme Council's provisos 
relating to ratification of the START I treaty were met. In the 
documents which were signed the United States and Russia stated 
that they respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and 
independence, that is, they are becoming guarantors of our 
security. After acceding to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
-- and I am confident that our parliament will now adopt such a 
decision -- Ukraine will be safeguarded against nuclear attack. 
And, equally importantly, we will receive compensation for the 
uranium in the strategic missile warheads which will be sent to 
Russia, plus financial, scientific, and technical assistance in 
eliminating our nuclear weapons. 
  As for the part of your question relating to a tougher 
credit 
blockade, in December there was indeed a real threat of 
isolation. But now broad political and economic cooperation 
prospects are opening up for us. 
  Prokopchuk: And a final, purely personal point, 
Leonid Makarovich, if you will permit me. Since you also became 
head of government there has been an obvious increase in your 
workload. Do you manage to carve out time for your family and 
grandchildren? And in general what is your life like outside 
work? 
  Kravchuk: My grandson Andrey is 13 and as tall as 
me; he's an early developer. And my granddaughter Mashenka is 
six. She's so sweet and interesting. When they are with me 
it's the only time I get completely away from all the worries 
and problems. You have to answer their endless questions, you 
see. When we get involved in their games I myself also become 
like a child. I can play hide-and-seek with my eyes 
blindfolded; when they crawl around on their knees, I crawl 
around on my knees; when they jump, I jump. Those are the times 
I really relax....

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Melnik] </F>
  [Text] Kiev January 25 TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk called upon the parliament to revise its attitude 
towards the ratification of the US-Soviet Strategic Arms 
Reduction Treaty (START-1) and the 1992 Lisbon Protocol. 
  An official letter by the president insisting that Ukraine 
should join the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty [NPT] was 
distributed among Ukrainian lawmakers on Tuesday. 
  Last November the Ukrainian parliament ratified the START-1 
imposing several tough conditions and stating that Ukraine 
should not join the NPT. 
  Ukraine's membership of the NPT was one of the key issues of 
the tripartite meeting of the Russian, American and Ukrainian 
presidents in Moscow. 
  The Ukrainian parliament is to consider the Moscow statement 
of the three presidents later this week.

  [Text] Kiev, 25 Jan -- A letter, dated 24 January 1994, 
from the president of Ukraine to Ukrainian deputies and Ivan 
Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council of Ukraine, numbered 
1-14/23 and concerning the Moscow statement, was distributed to 
people's deputies of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. In 
particular the letter says: 
  "In connection with the recommendation by the Supreme 
Council 
of Ukraine contained in point 11 of the resolution of the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine of 18 November 1993, I am informing 
the Supreme Council about the steps taken by myself and the 
government of Ukraine. Talks in a bi-lateral and tri-lateral 
format with the Russian Federation and the United States of 
America were initiated by us to implement the Supreme Council 
resolution. As a result of intense talks in Kiev, Washington 
and Moscow, a tri-lateral statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States and Russia was elaborated, which was 
signed in Moscow on 14 January of this year. The text of the 
statement and the appendix to it contain clauses going in the 
direction of implementing the issues noted in the resolution. 
In particular the accords reached in Moscow envisage granting 
Ukraine guarantees of its national security after the START-I 
Treaty comes into force and Ukraine accedes to the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. They contain pledges regarding 
confirming independence, sovereignty, and existing borders and 
refraining from threats of force or using force or measures of 
economic pressure; a pledge by the United States to grant 
Ukraine a minimum of 170 million dollars for the dismantlement 
of nuclear weapons with the possibility of the size of this 
assistance being increased; moving all nuclear warheads in 
Ukraine to Russia for their dismantlement with simultaneous 
compensation being granted in the form of deliveries of fuel 
assemblies to Ukraine for the needs of its nuclear power 
engineering. 
  In addition, and this is of especial political significance, 
it was confirmed that Ukraine, the United States and Russia will 
cooperate with each other as fully-fledged and equal partners 
and that relations between them should be developed on the 
principles of respect for the independence, sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of every state. 
  The United States also stated its readiness to render 
assistance to Ukraine in creating a market economy in Ukraine. 
In this way the tri-lateral statement and the appendix to it, 
and also their implementation, meet the demands set forth in the 
resolution of the Supreme Council of 18 November 1993. In 
connection with this, in accordance with an article of the 
constitution of Ukraine, by way of a legislative initiative I am 
submitting proposals to remove the reservations contained in the 
resolution of the Supreme Council of 18 November 1993 concerning 
article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol and Ukraine's accession to the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. A draft of a corresponding 
resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine is appended." 
  Appended to the document is the Supreme Council's draft 
resolution on this issue of the following contents: 
  "The Supreme Council's resolution on the implementation by 
the Ukrainian president and the Ukrainian government of 
recommendations contained in Paragraph 11 of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council's resolution on the ratification of the Treaty 
between the USSR and the U.S. on the Reduction and Limitation of 
Strategic Nuclear Offensive Weapons, signed in Moscow on 31 July 
1991, and the protocol to it, signed in Lisbon on behalf of 
Ukraine on 23 May 1992; 
  Taking account of the specific steps that were taken by the 
Ukrainian president and government in the period from November 
1993 to January 1994, in respect of the implementation of the 
provisions of the Supreme Council's resolution of 18 November 
1993; 
  Proceeding from the results of the meeting between the 
Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian Federation presidents in Moscow on 
14 January 1994 and the trilateral statement and appendix to it, 
singed by them; 
  Taking account of the fact that it was confirmed to Ukraine 
by the U.S. and Russian presidents that they were ready to 
extend to Ukraine national security guarantees after the START-1 
treaty is brought into effect and the Nuclear Non-proliferation 
Treaty is acceded to by Ukraine as a nuclear-free state; 
  As well as taking account of the obligations by the United 
States, Russia, and Great Britain relating to Ukraine, to 
respect its independence, sovereignty and existing borders, 
refrain from the threat or use of force against its territorial 
integrity or political independence, as well as refraining from 
economic pressure, and [taking account of] their obligation not 
to use any weapons against Ukraine; 
  In view of the confirmation from the Ukrainian, American, 
and 
Russian presidents that they will build their relations on the 
basis of respect for the independence, sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of each of the states, as well as the 
confirmation of their readiness to assist Ukraine in setting up 
an effective market economy; and 
  Acknowledging the fact that the United States assured 
Ukraine 
of providing technical and financial assistance to dismantle 
nuclear weapons securely and safely and preserve fissionable 
material, as well as of promoting the speedy implementation of 
the agreements on this assistance, that are already in 
existence, the Supreme Council of Ukraine resolves:" 
  1. Taking into account the specific measures taken by the 
president and Government of Ukraine regarding implementation of 
the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 18 November 
1993 and the steps on the part of the United States and Russia 
to meet Ukraine half way, to remove the reservations regarding 
Article 5 of the Protocol to the START-1 Treaty signed in Lisbon 
on 23 May 1992. 
  2. To charge the Government of Ukraine to exchange 
instruments of ratification of the START-1 Treaty. 
  3. To accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty of 1 
July 
1968, which will henceforth be called the Treaty, as a state not 
owning nuclear weapons, with the following statement: 
  1) Ukraine owns the components of the nuclear weapons that 
it 
inherited from the former USSR. After the weapons are 
dismantled and destroyed under its control and in accordance 
with a procedure that will rule out the possibility of reusing 
these weapons' components for the original purpose, Ukraine 
intends to use the material extracted from them exclusively for 
civilian purposes, as fuel for Ukrainian AES [nuclear electric 
power station]'s in particular, or receive compensation for them; 
  2) The Treaty does not fully cover the unique situation that 
arose as a result of the disintegration of nuclear power of the 
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The presence of nuclear 
weapons on the territory of Ukraine until they are eliminated 
entirely, as well as appropriate activity to maintain, service, 
and eliminate them, does not contravene Articles 1 and 2 of the 
Treaty. 
  3) Ukraine will hold talks with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency with the aim of concluding agreements regarding 
the guarantees envisaged by the Treaty; 
  4) The violation of the territorial integrity or 
inviolability of Ukraine's borders on the part of any nuclear 
state will be viewed by Ukraine as a violation of the Treaty.

  [Text] Kiev -- Asked by a UNIAN correspondent today to 
comment on the documents signed by the Ukrainian, Russian, and 
U.S. Presidents on removing nuclear weapons from Ukraine to 
Russia with the aim of dismantling them, Ihor Derkach, people's 
deputy of Ukraine and a member of the Supreme Council Committee 
for Defense and State Security Issues, stated: "This is yet 
another political step by Leonid Kravchuk who is unable to 
pursue any other policy. I cannot see any security guarantees 
from Russia and America. This simply is intended to deceive 
Ukraine with Kravchuk's help. As for the $155 million allocated 
to Ukraine by Bill Clinton, this is the money that has been paid 
to American specialists who were on assignment in Ukraine." 
  Mykola Shulha, chairman of the Supreme Council Committee for 
Issues of State Sovereignty and Inter-Republican and 
Inter-ethnic Relations: "If after signing the documents Russia 
does not comply with the obligations assumed, this could 
undermine the global authority of such an influential state as 
America, and would have negative consequences for the whole 
world. As for the trilateral agreement, I shall endeavour to 
convince the Supreme Council to ratify this document. I believe 
that a compromise solution can also be found in settling the 
issues of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol. Policy should be 
made through understanding and respect for the interests of our 
states." 
  Volodymyr Filenko, people's deputy of Ukraine and chairman 
of 
the Party of the Democratic Revival of Ukraine: "I expressed my 
opinion even before the documents were signed and can confirm 
that my assessment is positive. First, Ukraine today is 
economically unable to maintain this nuclear potential. Second, 
as a result of signing the agreement it will be provided with 
fuel for its nuclear electric stations, which will partly 
resolve the energy problem. Third, it will become possible to 
set up a certain stabilization fund to introduce the hryvnya 
[new national currency]. However, this is Ukraine's last 
reserve, and political and economic reforms are now badly 
needed." 
  Volodmyr Klymchuk, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Ukraine: "I assess the signing of the Moscow agreement to be 
a Ukrainian diplomatic success, implementing the Declaration on 
the Independence of Ukraine. At last its primary provision on 
non- nuclear status is being realized and Ukraine will receive 
certain benefits which are badly needed. As for comments to the 
effect that nuclear weapons will be handed to Zhirinovskiy, I 
would like to stress that this figure is no doubt dangerous. 
However, hidden national communists and national fascists are 
an even greater danger." 
  Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, chairman of the secretariat of the 
People's Movement of Ukraine: "What happened in Moscow is a 
total betrayal of the Ukrainian people, and is bad enough to 
stand trial for." 
  Mykola Bahrov, chairman of the Supreme Council of the 
Republic of the Crimea: "My assessment of the Moscow agreement 
between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on the 
elimination of Ukrainian nuclear weapons is positive. In 
general, President Leonid Kravchuk's assets are the 
international recognition of Ukraine. His liabilities are what 
has happened to the Ukrainian economy."

  [Text] Kiev, Jan 14 (AFP) -- Leading Ukrainian lawmakers 
sharply criticized the treaty on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament 
signed in Moscow Friday, with several calling it "treason" and 
demanding that President Leonid Kravchuk step down. 
  "It is national treason," Vyacheslav Chornovyl, leader of 
the 
nationalist opposition movement Rukh, told AFP. "The United 
States and Russia have brought Ukraine to its knees." 
  The treaty, under which Ukraine pledged to get rid of all 
the 
nuclear weapons on its territory, was signed at the Kremlin by 
Kravchuk, US President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin.

  [Text] Kiev -- Rukh-Press reported on 13 January that 
People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh] Chairman Vyacheslav 
Chornovil has described Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's 
signing of the treaty on removing Ukraine's 176 nuclear missiles 
as a national betrayal. "This treaty will mean the full nuclear 
disarmament of Ukraine in as far as it embraces not only liquid 
fuel missiles, but also modern solid fuel missiles, which do not 
come under the 'START- I' Treaty, the Rukh chairman emphasized. 
[no closing quotation mark as received] 
  This is a shameful capitulation, for Ukraine will receive 
neither a single guarantee of its security, nor serious 
compensation. Two world superpowers -- the United States and 
Russia -- have combined their efforts in order to bring Ukraine 
to its knees. And this is easy for them to do because, having 
plundered the state, the rotten Communist regime headed by 
Kravchuk is prepared for any kind of betrayal as long an 
economic catastrophe is averted and they hold on to power at the 
expense of American and Russian handouts. Evidently Kravchuk 
expects the nomenclature to win in the March elections and the 
Supreme Council to ratify this shameful treaty. If we do not 
remove the traitors from power, Vyacheslav Chornovil warned, 
then that is the end of Ukraine. They will not stop for 
anything -- they will give up nuclear weapons, the Black Sea 
Fleet, the Crimea, and then even Ukraine itself. Then, I fear 
that Ukraine will for the second time this century lose a 
God-given chance to consolidate its statehood." [no opening

<F P=106> [Interview with UN expert Professor Volodymyr Butkevych, by </F>
Oksana Hutsul; place and date not given: "The President Says 
It's an Advantage. Time Will Tell"] 
  [Text] Hutsul: What consequences will Ukraine 
face after the signing of the tripartite Moscow accord? 
  Butkevych: In my opinion, Ukraine's prestige in 
the world community will increase. Everybody understands that 
Ukraine is the first owner of nuclear arms that has decided to 
get rid of them serving as an example to others. It is evident 
that we will pursue the declared policy. What will other states 
gain? Ukraine's decision will reduce the number of nuclear 
states and strengthen world security. 
  However, I want to avoid pompous phrases like "historic 
stage 
in the development of international relations." I only want to 
say that this is the first step taken by a nuclear state toward 
implementing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. By the 
way, this is quite a complicated document. We have gained by 
joining the treaty, although many problems remain unresolved. 
Our joining the treaty will raise the issue of peaceful nuclear 
explosions currently used for building deep underground 
reservoirs for gas and oil. Experts cite at least 20 examples 
of when nuclear explosions are indispensable. There will be 
questions concerning the development and use of new nuclear 
technologies for peaceful purposes, nuclear fuel production, 
and, -- the most important -- security assurances for Ukraine. 
There have been positive changes with regard to the latter. 
You probably remember that some time ago, we faced an 
ultimatum: There can be no security assurances prior to signing 
the treaty. Yet, it is clear that one cannot make another state 
eliminate its nuclear arms without granting this state's 
security. As of today, we are the first country to receive 
security assurances in the form of a treaty. However, our 
diplomacy and the legislature will have to resolve a number of 
issues. The Supreme Council will have to ratify certain 
international agreements which will probably put forth new 
questions. We have to understand that compliance with our 
commitments will lead us to adopting a series of legal acts 
concerning the nonnuclear status, nuclear power engineering, and 
technologies. We need our legislature's goodwill and readiness 
to proceed in the same direction. 
  Hutsul: History is history, and international 
prestige, too, is a factor of importance. Still, what if our 
disarmament exposes us to "harsh treatment" from our northern 
neighbor? 
  Butkevych: Five or six years ago, a Swedish 
scientist conducted research and reached the conclusion that a 
nonnuclear state gains much more than it loses with regard to 
its national security. 
  Hutsul: However, there are trends in the world 
to acquire nuclear arms.... 
  Butkevych: These are different processes, 
although I must admit that the NPT is not flawless. The treaty 
does not equally distribute the commitments of nuclear and 
nonnuclear states. The imperfect wording of articles leads to a 
situation when nonnuclear states have the same commitments as 
their nuclear counterparts. The treaty deals with proliferation 
of nuclear arms from the latter to the former and does not 
mention an opposite process. Nor does it resolve the issue of 
transporting nuclear arms via territories of nonnuclear 
countries, while Ukraine's geopolitical situation does not 
permit any other solution. The resolution of this issue is 
vitally important to us. In other words, a new stage of nuclear 
disarmament has begun, not experienced by any other country, and 
Ukraine is going to play a leading role in it. 
  Hutsul: Suppose the Supreme Council does not 
ratify the treaty. What will happen then? 
  Butkevych: If the parliament does not ratify the 
NPT in the form advocated by Ukraine and finally accepted by the 
world community, this will be viewed as a challenge. This 
undiplomatic stubbornness may cost our nation a high price. I 
believe that the legislature will ratify the treaty after a 
detailed analysis of all the clauses. Only if they find the 
treaty to contain some discriminating articles, will the 
legislature have the moral right to impose a ban on it. 
However, after analyzing all the circumstances I am still 
optimistic with regard to ratification.

  [Text] The trilateral statement by the Ukrainian, U.S., and 
Russian presidents on the elimination of nuclear weapons on the 
territory of our state remains at the center of attention. So 
today we continue the topic of a nuclear-free Ukraine. 
  Talking with our correspondent Vitaliy Lytvynov, Colonel 
General Ivan Oliynyk, deputy defense minister for arms issues, 
speaks on the military, scientific, and technological aspects of 
the implementation of the trilateral statement and an appendix 
to it on the elimination of nuclear weapons on the territory of 
Ukraine: 
  Oliynyk, in Russian with superimposed Ukrainian 
translation: "The atmosphere at the meeting between the 
three presidents on 14 January 1994 was exceptionally friendly 
and benevolent. It was one of respect. The timing of the 
meeting was no accident. It had been predetermined by a number 
of factors which need airing and explaining today. Factor 1 is 
the technical condition of the nuclear warheads in Ukraine 
today. Factor 2 is our difficult economic situation. And, 
finally, Factor 3 is that both the president and government had 
to implement the decisions taken by the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council." 
  Lytvynov: The world has reacted to this in a very 
positive manner. The interpretation of this issue here in 
Ukraine, however, is not uniform, in particular because the 
people are concerned about us actually becoming defenseless 
should we rid ourselves of our nuclear forces. This is how our 
collocutor answered this question: 
  Oliynyk: "The condition of the arms and the 
purpose of their use in Ukraine (?did not have any bearing) on 
the issues of our security. We do not control these weapons, we 
cannot maintain them in the technically perfect condition and we 
cannot but implement the decision taken by our state to become 
non-nuclear in future." 
  "With regard to our security, it can be viewed from two 
standpoints. That is, relying on our own forces and creating 
non- nuclear weapons that can enable us to ensure the protection 
of our state; after all, we are a great rocket and space power. 
It should also be said that we hope the pledges that were given 
by the United States, the Russian Federation, and Great Britain 
will be carried into effect both in respect of our state and the 
international community." 
  Correspondent: Answering the question on how long, 
what is the duration of the process of nuclear disarmament the 
Ukrainian deputy defense minister said: 
  Oliynyk: "This is a lengthy process which is to 
be determined by the technical condition and the possibility to 
safely move these weapons over a long distance by transporting 
them. Everybody today wants to hear when the first and the last 
weapon will be removed. The state must have its own state 
secrets, for these are very dangerous and unusual weapons. That 
is why to advertise today when a train will cross Ukraine by 
railway over a distance of over 700 km to our western borders is 
unnecessary and risky. We must keep this transport a secret, to 
ensure safe transportation."

  [Text] Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaly Radetsky has 
assessed the trilateral agreement on nuclear disarmament signed 
by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in Moscow on January 14 
as "timely." "Ukraine has been and will be a great missile and 
space power regardless of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from 
our territory," he told a meeting with the heads of the mass 
media in Kiev. "We have everything necessary to build missiles 
and fly into space," he added. 
  Speaking on his attitude to the presidential elections in 
Crimea, Radetsky pointed out that as defense minister he 
regarded this event "normally." "But as a citizen of Ukraine, I 
am confident that there must be only one president in the 
republic," he said. 
  The minister also said an inspection of the Black Sea Fleet 
will be carried out in the near future. He said it was "costly" 
for both Russia and Ukraine to maintain the Black Sea Fleet. 
  Summing up the results of the first two years since the 
creation of the Ukrainian army, Radetsky said that during this 
time Ukraine concluded bilateral agreements on military 
cooperation with 19 states. During Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's visit to Kiev scheduled for January 20-21, such an 
agreement is expected to be signed with Kazakhstan, too. 
  According to Radetsky, by now the Ukrainian army has been 
reduced by over 200,000 troops compared to last year. By the 
end of 1995, the republican armed forces will have 450,000 
personnel.

<F P=106> [Article by Olena Lisnycha: "What Will Ukraine Get From the </F>
Nuclear Deal?"] 
  [Text] At first, it should be emphasized that terms and 
figures included in the agreement by the three presidents and in 
an appendix to it are suspended in a volatile imbalance, because 
that document does not have the force of a concrete 
international legal document, reflecting simply formal political 
obligations assumed by all sides. If that document had the form 
of an agreement or treaty, it would certainly affect our 
internal law, which would enable the parliament to resort to its 
favorite weapon, impeachment. 
  "I have no doubts whatsoever about the legitimacy of what 
was 
done by the executive branch. However, it is up to the Supreme 
Council to examine how this was done," said Mr. Chalyy, chief of 
the legal department at the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. Thus, 
the Ukrainian parliament will have to ratify START I with no 
reservations and join the nonproliferation treaty to implement 
the agreement. Ideally, the legislature should endorse START 2, 
that is, to give the go-ahead regarding the destruction of 
nuclear arsenals so that the Moscow agreement is legally 
binding. Silenced by top officials of our state, this question 
somehow remains nothing more than rhetoric. 
  It is strange that the agreement's appendix provides for the 
decommissioning of most of the modern SS-24 missiles within 10 
months and not the SS-19's whose short expiration terms cause 
much concern. 
  The agreement signed in Moscow will surely be extended by a 
long chain of negotiations, and its contours -- now pretty vague 
-- will have to become more specific. 
<H5>  Nuclear Fuel </H5>
  "Enriched uranium contained in nuclear arms is a matter of a 
purely commercial nature," said Bill Clinton at a press 
conference at the Boryspil Airport. It was agreed that within 
seven years, Russia would process -- at our expense -- highly 
enriched uranium into fuel for atomic power stations, one 
portion of which will be immediately shipped to Ukraine (100 
tonnes of low-activated uranium in the first 10 months), while 
another part will be sold to the United States for $1 billion. 
Ideally, Washington should send this billion to Kiev. However, 
Russia also claims its portion of the nuclear pie as a country 
tasked with processing the uranium. So far, details regarding 
the division of this billion-dollar tidbit are inaccessible. 
<H5>  Debts for Energy Sources </H5>
  The information that came in last Friday [14 January] about 
Moscow's pledges of fair play in negotiating the $2-billion 
indebtness with Kiev have not borne out entirely. Looming ahead 
is the perspective of endless blanket-pulling and difficult 
inter-governmental talks. According to a dark vision by 
government officials, instead of the entire debt, Russia will 
agree to forgive only its small portion. The point is that 
structures with looser dependence from the state, such as the 
"Gazprom," were also engaged in energy supplies. This kind of 
"debt canceling" is more profitable for them. 
<H5>  Support of International Financial Organizations </H5>
  This support is possible only when Ukraine devises clear-cut 
plans for getting out of an economic crisis. In other words, 
only staunch optimists can count on it at the present time. For 
example, propped up by the United States, Russia is expecting 
$1.5 billion from the International Monetary Fund and $500 
billion from the World Bank. This is a modest sum considering 
the size of Russia, and would remain so if allocated to Ukraine. 
Hypothetically, even with credits on hand, Ukraine should be 
prepared for high interest rates. 
<H5>  Tactical Weapons </H5>
  This appears to be the biggest "white spot" in all this 
nuclear business. The agreement does not offer a clear 
statement on compensation for tactical weapons removed from the 
three ex-Soviet republics to Russia. Officials warily say that 
"experts are now working on this issue." 
<H5>  Support for Weapons Destruction Process </H5>
  This support was offered by the Nunn-Lugar plan initiated in 
December 1991 and will be financed by U.S. Defense Department 
resources. The plan's basic provisions envisioned for 1993 
fiscal year spendings for dismantling and destruction of nuclear 
weapons, establishing aid funds for disarming CIS countries, and 
humanitarian aid, which is $800 million, $100 million, and $410 
million, respectively, for all nuclear successors of the Soviet 
Union. Of this amount, $175 million for technical assistance in 
weapons destruction was promised to Leonid Kravchuk by 
then-President Bush in December 1992. This promise was also 
confirmed by Bill Clinton at the meeting with the Ukrainian 
president in Kiev. The American side is relying on its 
experience of scraping similar 300-missile complexes in 1992 
that needed $300 billion for destruction. Foreign Ministry 
officials claim that if the process "gets rolling," Americans 
are ready to provide additional funds to Ukraine. On the other 
hand, the Nunn-Lugar program contains quite a few discriminative 
limitations. One of them, for instance, says that the CIS 
country receiving this aid should also put in its own money to 
finance the destruction of nuclear weapons. So disarmament will 
definitely put a squeeze on the more than meager Ukrainian 
budget. In addition, Ukraine will be able to use the $175 
billion only for U.S. and Ukrainian (practically nonexistent) 
technologies and experts. 
  The United States will definitely reap most of the profits 
coming from the nuclear deal. Bill Clinton returned to the 
White House with another victory. The United States will cash 
in on buying cheap fuel for atomic power stations practically 
without spending their budget dollars for the important cause of 
"peace in all the world." Ex-Soviet republics safeguard the 
quiet sleep of Americans because the spread of nuclear 
technologies and weapons to unreliable Asian regimes -- so much 
feared by America shortly before the collapse of the Soviet 
Union -- appears to be unrealistic now. Russia, America's 
strategic partner, achieved its goals by bashing Ukraine on the 
nuclear issue. The issue of energy debts -- one of the 
leverages over Ukraine -- remains unsolved; now even fuel 
supplies to Ukrainian atomic power plants depend on Russia. 
  So what has Ukraine gotten from the deal except for 
international acknowledgment? For now, we can definitely point 
to a great relief for our state budget from a huge burden 
imposed by servicing nuclear complexes. In addition, 
preliminary estimates show that the 100 tonnes of fuel for 
atomic stations, due within 10 months, will keep our plants 
going for two years.

  [Text] The trilateral statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on the elimination of 
nuclear weapons on the territory of our state remains the focus 
of attention. If, in the world as a whole this move is 
supported on a mass scale, in Ukraine attitudes toward this 
statement and its assessments are ambiguous. Our correspondent 
Petro Ostapenko met Oleksandr Tarasenko, the deputy chairman of 
the Supreme Council of Ukraine's Commission for Issues of 
Defense and State Security, and asked him to express his 
attitude toward the trilateral statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia. 
  [Begin recording] Ostapenko: Ukraine's President 
Leonid Kravchuk and representatives of the executive bodies of 
power are saying today that the trilateral statement is the 
result and continuation, let us say, of the decisions by the 
Supreme Council on nuclear weapons. Oleksandr, what is your 
opinion? Is this true? 
  Tarasenko: Well, this document still needs 
in-depth comprehension. First, it is called a statement, a 
trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United 
States, and Russia. How should we assess it today? Does it 
have a legal force as an international document and as an 
agreement, or is this just a statement? Upon studying it 
profoundly -- yesterday our commission was considering this 
document -- upon studying it profoundly, it can, in the long 
run, be qualified as an international agreement. In compliance 
with our current legislation -- the Constitution first and 
foremost -- and in compliance with the law on the president, on 
his plenary powers, the international agreements that Ukraine -- 
that is, the executive power, concludes in the field of defense, 
military construction, military relations with neighboring and 
other states, are subject to mandatory ratification by the 
Supreme Council. 
  Why did I say that this document is an agreement and not a 
statement? Because, there is a supplement to the trilateral 
statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and 
Russia as of 14 January, and this supplement provides specific 
dates, the terms in which our strategic nuclear weapons should 
be fully deactivated, their number, and so on. This goes beyond 
the limits of the resolution that was adopted by the Supreme 
Council. What does this supplement stipulate? This supplement 
gives, for example, such parameters: Ukraine ensures the 
elimination of all nuclear weapons, including strategic 
offensive weapons -- that is, strategic air force, TU-160 and 
other aircraft carrying nuclear missiles, located on its 
territory, in compliance with its relevant agreements within the 
term of seven years as is envisaged by the START I Treaty and 
within the context of the statement by the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine on Ukraine's non-nuclear status, all the RS-22 missiles 
-- to be more specific they are called SS-24 -- on Ukraine's 
territory will be deactivated within 10 months by means of 
removing their warheads. What does it mean? 
  You know that in two thirds of our silos launcher vehicles 
are filled with liquid fuel -- that is, heptyl. The entire 
world already knows what kind of a liquid fuel this is. This 
heptyl is a super poisonous substance, and the launcher vehicle 
itself is even a bigger powder keg than the launcher vehicle and 
the warhead as a whole. Proceeding from this, Ukraine and its 
plenary bodies and persons must take into account their own 
interests, first and foremost, and not the interests of those 
who benefit from this unilaterally. I believe that the Supreme 
Council, either the present or the future one, should seriously 
ponder over this document, and it can be ratified only after its 
parameters are specified. 
  Ostapenko: I am sorry to interrupt you. You have 
just read out the item that has to do with all sides without 
exception. But nothing is said here about the Supreme Council 
resolution on the ratification of START I with reservations. It 
clearly stipulates that 36 percent of launcher vehicles and 42 
percent of warheads are subject to elimination today. That is 
to say, these parameters have been extended to all nuclear [word 
indistinct]. 
  Tarasenko: Absolutely. They run contrary to the 
Supreme Council resolution. The Supreme Council resolution and 
START I envisage percentage and here is says about the complete 
elimination. 
  In this connection I would like to say the following, so 
that 
our radio listeners and our compatriots, our half-brothers, as 
they say, would know it: All those strategic nuclear systems 
located on the territory of Ukraine are targeted at certain 
objectives in the United States of America and relevant bases 
beyond the borders of the U.S. Correspondingly, approximately 
the same number of nuclear weapons are targeted at our 
territory. Well, this is military strategy and tactics and 
there is nothing incomprehensible here. Everybody understands 
this: If you target me, then I target you. But this document 
should also envisage adequate moves on the part of the United 
States of America, and our control over this, because everyone 
will control us, control how we eliminate nuclear weapons, 
remove nuclear warheads, transfer them from Ukraine to Russia. 
The only thing envisaged here is that Ukraine will have the 
possibility to control Russia neutralizing the nuclear warheads. 
However, this agreement does not envisage what the United 
States will do with that quantity of strategic nuclear weapons 
that are targeted at us, and what will be Ukraine's role in 
carrying out control over this process, as far as the actions of 
the United States are concerned. 
  Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin declared that they would 
decode their missiles, which would then be retargetted at some 
deserted islands, or something like that. Ukraine's 
participation here is not envisaged, is that right? 
  Tarasenko: Ukraine's participation here is not 
envisaged. Moreover, I disagree with such a stand, just as a 
citizen and just as an inhabitant of this planet Earth. If 
Ukraine eliminates these weapons, the former weapons of the 
Soviet Union, as is known, then the United States of America 
should eliminate and neutralize the same quantity of weapons. 
This is what we are talking about, not about retargetting at 
some other states, and so on. That is to say, there is no 
alternative in the world to universal nuclear disarmament and 
appropriate actions by all nuclear states. This is what our 
politicians should insist on, and at this point I again repeat 
and emphasize that the given document needs in-depth 
comprehension in legal terms, in terms of international law. 
What obligations, what guarantees can we talk about? Because, 
they already guaranteed us something to a certain extent. Let 
us not mention any names today, because there has already been 
enough talk about this. Who is to blame and who, let us say, 
ordered the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons from the 
territory of Ukraine? Those are our weapons. They would have 
been of paramount importance for the defense capacity of 
Ukraine. However, we transferred those weapons and could not 
cope with these ones. Here we outwitted ourselves. 
  Ostapenko: I know, Oleksandr, that you are 
familiar with the technical condition of the strategic nuclear 
weapons, missiles, and warheads located on Ukraine's territory. 
Today, in numerous interviews, the military say that it is 
difficult for Ukraine to service them, that Ukraine will be 
unable to service them, therefore, the sooner we deactivate and 
transfer these weapons, the better for Ukraine. What do you 
think about it, please. 
  Tarasenko: You, Petro, probably touched upon a 
very important aspect of this problem. It is quite clear that 
nuclear warheads and their systems are the most sophisticated 
systems because they should be sophisticated as they guarantee 
the safety of a nuclear warhead itself and a silo as a whole. 
This is why there exists a practice in the world according to 
which the given warheads are serviced by the authors who 
manufactured them. The authors themselves can destroy them. 
There is no other process, as they say. In this respect, we 
could find a state that would do this [word indistinct] but we 
cannot do this without Russia because the one who will have 
access there should know what it is, and so on. Therefore, every 
launching system and, moreover, nuclear warhead has relevant 
terms which guarantee their safety, and systems. We cannot do 
this without Russia. Therefore, it is necessary either to have 
very specific, responsible bilateral agreements toward that end 
with Russia on ensuring periodic servicing of the warheads and 
the silos as a whole or to neutralize and transfer them after 
their guaranteed service life expires. There is no other way 
around. Also, it could be possible to do as follows: A certain 
number of warheads and silos could be dismantled without their 
periodic servicing after their guaranteed service life expires. 
This is the way to follow. This would be the most correct, most 
appropriate way. Following it, one should move from the 
warhead, from the head, as they say, to the tail. That is to 
say, to dismantle the entire silo and not just remove the 
warheads and leave the rest with ourselves. It would be the 
same kind of a powder keg. Therefore, the most correct way is 
to act in line with a stage-by-stage, unit-by-unit principle. 
Both the warhead and the launcher vehicle should be dismantled 
completely. This would ensure the highest level of security to 
our state. 
  Ostapenko: One more, very important aspect, as 
far as this problem is concerned. Did you see the guarantees of 
Ukraine's national security in this statement and in the 
supplement, the guarantees that Ukraine and the Supreme Council 
were striving for and which all those living in Ukraine wish to 
have. 
  Tarasenko: Undoubtedly, there are certain aspects 
and elements of security here. There are such provisions, and 
so on. But, as they say, history and mankind know instances 
when such guarantees were given, when there were agreements, but 
there was the Second World War despite these bilateral and 
multilateral agreements, and 22 million people died and the 
economies in a whole number of countries were destroyed. This 
is why one should rely on God but have his own mind, as they 
say. Both our military and scientific potentials should work 
toward ensuring our state security -- not at the expense of 
nuclear weapons now but at the expense of other highly effective 
means. Such measures are being taken today. This is why, 
simultaneously with the reduction and elimination of nuclear 
weapons, fulfilling that resolution by the Supreme Council, we 
should work concurrently toward ensuring the combat readiness of 
our Armed Forces. Our commission, together with military 
departments, is carrying out this work. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Such is the attitude of people's deputy, deputy 
chairman of the Supreme Council Commission for Issues of Defense 
and State Security Oleksandr Tarasenko toward the trilateral 
statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and 
Russia on the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yefim Shvartsman] </F>
  [Text] Kiev January 24 TASS -- Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy, 
Ukrainian ambassador to Russia, has described the tripartite 
Moscow agreement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament as a great 
breakthrough not only for Ukranian, but also for Russian 
diplomacy. He took part in the Perekryostok programme, 
broadcast by Ukrainian TV on Sunday, which highlighted the 
forthcoming discussion of the agreement by the Ukrainian 
parliament, due to take place on January 25. 
  The Ukrainian ambassador stressed that Russia had approached 
the tripartite Moscow agreement realistically, acting as an 
equal and not senior partner during the settlement of the 
complicated problem. Kryzhanovskiy said that he supported the 
tripartite Moscow agreement on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament 
both as a diplomat and a Ukrainian citizen. "Nuclear weapons 
are not what our people need today. The problem for them is 
survival. If nuclear disarmament even involves compensation, 
the Ukrainian parliament should support the Moscow agreement," 
he said. 
  The same idea was expressed by Ukrainian Deputy Defence 
Minister Colonel General Ivan Bizhan, who also took part in the 
Perekryostok programme. He stressed that President Kravchuk had 
acted in Moscow on the basis of the resolution of the Ukrainian 
parliament in the part, dealing with the ratification of the 
START-1 Treaty. He pointed out that the participation of the 
United States in the Moscow treaty is a positive factor and a 
guarantee, and called attention to the importance for Ukraine of 
the fact that Russia agreed to provide maintenance to the 
nuclear warheads, deployed in Ukraine.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet will consider the 
parliamentary commissions' resolution on the joint statement 
signed by the Ukrainian, Russian and U.S. presidents in Moscow 
on January 25. 
  The Supreme Soviet's presidium discussed this issue in Kiev 
on Monday. 
  Leader of the Ukrainian parliament's working group on 
preparations for ratification of the START-1 treaty, Environment 
Minister Yuriy Kostenko, said on Monday that he saw neither 
economic and military "interests of Ukraine" nor guarantees for 
security in the statement. 
  He believes that "due to this the Moscow statement should be 
considered properly and receive a juridical evaluation." 
  Kostenko explained the fact that the document was signed in 
a 
form of a statement requiring no ratification by the parliament 
as "juridical intriguing" and demanded that deputies determine 
"whether the Moscow statement was useful for Ukraine." 
  He added that the Moscow trilateral statement proposed "in 
fact a new scheme for Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, which 
differs from the one worked out by the parliament." 
  "We are moving towards a non-nuclear status. However, we do 
this in conformity with the interests of Ukraine. The events in 
Moscow represent not only a military but also an economic and 
political split within the country rather than nuclear 
disarmament," the minister believes. 
  He also stated that Ukraine had already withdrawn to Russia 
tactical nuclear weapons together with approximately 10 tons of 
high enriched plutonium and 90 tons of high enriched uranium. 
In his words, 1 kilogram of plutonium will cost about $1 Mn and 
1 kilogram of uranium up to $100,000 on the world market. 
  "This means that today Russia is Ukraine's debtor and not 
vice versa. Russia must compensate Ukraine for the tactical 
nuclear weapons with account taken of the equivalent exchange of 
the cost of uranium for oil and gas."

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Kostenko, Ukrainian environment </F>
minister and head of a parliamentary working group on START I 
and nuclear disarmament, by Vladimir Skachko: "This Is Not 
Disarmament but Disrobing (razdevaniye, also meaning `robbing') 
of the State. The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet Can Give a Legal 
Assessment of the Moscow Statement by the Three Presidents" -- 
first paragraph is introduction; place, date not given] 
  [Text] Ivan Plyushch, speaker of the Ukrainian Supreme 
Soviet, has stated that the Supreme Soviet must decide on the 
question of compatibility of Ukraine's national interests with 
the statement signed by presidents of the United States, 
Ukraine, and Russia on the future of the Ukrainian strategic 
missiles and also consider a draft resolution on Ukraine's 
accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. According to 
Ivan Plyushch, because the resolution on joining the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty was prepared by the presidential 
services, the report on this matter should be made by President 
Leonid Kravchuk. Yuriy Kostenko, head of a special working 
deputies group on preparing the START I Treaty and on Ukraine's 
acquiring a nonnuclear status, and minister for environmental 
protection, commented for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the deputies' 
decision to return to these matters. 
  Kostenko: The Moscow tripartite statement has 
actually offered quite a different scheme of nuclear disarmament 
for Ukraine than what was decided on this score by our Supreme 
Soviet. This scheme does not take many aspects into account 
either from the viewpoint of national security or from the 
viewpoint of our economic interests. Therefore the Moscow 
statement must be considered in full as a separate agreement and 
be given an appropriate legal assessment. 
  Skachko: But this is a statement, not an 
agreement. The parliament may neither ratify it, nor fail to 
ratify it. 
  Kostenko: I understand this. The statement has 
been made in such a way that it could not be submitted to the 
consideration of the Supreme Soviet. This is so-called legal 
chicanery. Now, Ukraine's supreme legislative body adopts one 
scheme of nuclear disarmament while the executive branch, 
contrary to this, proposes a totally different one. Therefore 
the Supreme Soviet, in line with the current constitution and 
entitled to consider all international agreements, is also to 
consider this document as well as give it a proper legal 
appraisal and establish whether it is good for Ukraine. 
Possibly, it will have to be vetoed as a document which 
contradicts Ukraine's national interests. 
  Skachko: And presumably the parliament 
resolution on this question must be enforced? 
  Kostenko: This is undoubtedly the power of the 
Supreme Soviet. Moreover, I would like to point out that the 
work conducted by the Supreme Soviet will allow, in my opinion, 
more or less to balance Ukraine's interests with the interests 
of those who insist that Ukraine become nuclear-free. In the 
Moscow document I do not see either the economic interests or 
guarantees of Ukraine's security that many are talking about so 
much. 
  Skachko: How would you comment on the view that 
neither the statement nor the appendix to it contains a word on 
compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons evacuated to 
Russia? 
  Kostenko: This only shows once again that there 
is a certain contradiction between what our Supreme Soviet has 
adopted and what our president has signed. The parliament 
resolution clearly says that compensation must be made also for 
the tactical nuclear weapons, while the Moscow statement does 
not say anything about this separately. As far as I know, 
Russia apparently promises to consider this issue and provide 
some compensation after all. 
Skachko: In other words, compensation for 
tactical nuclear weapons is a subject of separate talks between 
Ukraine and Russia? 
  Kostenko: Yes, talks on this issue have been 
going on, but it has not been settled conclusively yet because 
experts have been tasked to consider it and establish how 
exactly compensation will be made. 
  Skachko: Has any time frame been defined for 
making compensation to Ukraine for the tactical nuclear weapons? 
  Kostenko: No, no term has been established. 
This is very difficult to do because no one knows with what 
funds compensation will be made. If from the proceeds of the 
500 tonnes of enriched uranium that Russia is to sell to the 
United States, then this can happen only after this uranium has 
been sold on the world market. Only then will Russia start 
partially to receive real money and, naturally, will be able to 
make some compensation to Ukraine. At present, however, no such 
funds are available. True, there is also another option (which, 
incidentally, would be the most adequate for Ukraine): to 
evaluate the cost of each warhead. This is possible because it 
is known how much uranium and plutonium there is in each 
warhead. Therefore, using an equivalent, one could estimate the 
value of the tactical nuclear weapons that we have transferred 
to Russia. According to our preliminary estimates, the value is 
$10 billion. Assuming this sum, Russia is already in debt to 
Ukraine -- not the other way around, as some are trying to have 
us believe today. And if we talk about energy, then, given that 
uranium and plutonium are very valuable energy carriers, an 
equivalent exchange scheme could be used: We deliver highly 
enriched uranium and plutonium to them, and they supply us with 
oil and gas. But unfortunately this option has not been used; 
moreover, during the talks the subject of "plutonium" was 
somehow lost altogether. And it is a very costly element: one 
kilogram of enriched plutonium, according to various estimates, 
can cost up to $1 million, and one kilogram of enriched uranium 
up to $100,000. Now you can imagine the value of the material 
assets that we have already transferred to Russia. 
  Skachko: How much uranium and plutonium have you 
transferred to Russia? 
  Kostenko: Approximately 10 tonnes of enriched 
plutonium and more than 90 tonnes of enriched uranium. 
  Skachko: What is the correlation in parliament 
of people who advocate a solution of the problem of Ukraine's 
nuclear weapons on terms favorable for it and those who are 
ready to give the missiles away? 
  Kostenko: Judging by the results of voting 
during the ratification of START I, it can said that the 
majority of parliament members are inclined toward organizing a 
normal nuclear disarmament of Ukraine. But what has happened in 
Moscow is not nuclear disarmament but the disrobing of the 
state. In the military, economic, and political sense.

  [Text] The Ukrainian parliament's presidium did not pass 
any resolutions on the Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. presidents' 
Moscow statement on nuclear disarmament. 
  What the three presidents discussed and documented in Moscow 
is not an agreement, Chairman of the parliamentary Commission 
for International Affairs Dmitri Pavlychko told journalists. 
"Therefore, for the moment we can only state our attitude to 
this document," he said. 
  Pavlychko believes that the Moscow statement cannot replace 
the Ukrainian parliament's resolution. Such a resolution can 
only be replaced by an agreement, not by a protocol of intent, 
he said. "We can only ratify an agreement," he added. 
  Pavlychko also believes that the final decision on the 
problem will be made by a new parliament. He said that Leonid 
Kravchuk shared this belief.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ihor Nedyukha, candidate of technological </F>
sciences: "Once Again About the `Shield' and `Sword'"] 
  [Text] According to the press, the Ukrainian Nationalist 
Assembly [UNA] has sent the chairman of Ukraine's Security 
Service, Ye. Marchuk, a statement (the text was supplied), 
containing a request to evaluate President L. Kravchuk's 
activity during the negotiations with the presidents of the 
United States and Russia on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. This 
statement, in fact, accuses the Ukrainian president of 
violations of the law to the extent of high treason. 
  However, the impression arises that the UNA leadership had 
not read Marchuk in HOLOS UKRAYINY 12 December 1992 where he 
insisted on the expediency of Ukraine's staying under the 
"nuclear shield of Russia," in other words, on the current 
policy of the total nuclear disarmament of Ukraine. 
  For that reason, I find it inappropriate to demand that 
Marchuk does the evaluation. This conclusion does not only 
apply to the UNA appeal, but also to the analogous statement by 
the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party [UKRP]. 
  The validity of the above interpretation is confirmed, at 
least, by the fact that the transfer to Russia of the "Sword" -- 
the tactical nuclear weapons -- is known to have been completed 
on the night of 5 and 6 May 1992. 
  It remains to be hoped that opponents of the Ukrainian 
president in the ranks of the UNA and UKRP will also agree that 
the same people must be among those who have planned and those 
who are implementing the measures for withdrawing the entire 
"Sword" and "Shield" (strategic nuclear weapons) complex from 
Ukraine.

  [Text] The Moscow declaration on denuclearizing Ukraine 
signed by the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United 
States does not meet the republic's interests in full, deputy 
head of the international affairs commission Bogdan Goryn told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  In his words, the Supreme Soviet is now discussing the 
points 
that are out of line with the country's national interests. 
  In the meantime, Goryn says it is up to a new parliament, to 
be elected on March 27, to consider the ratification of the 
Moscow declaration because of inability by the Supreme Soviet to 
take a measured resolution on the issue. He said the parliament 
would adopt a resolution, but with some strings attached. 
  Last November, the parliament ratified the Start-I agreement 
and the Lisbon protocol, but conditioned that to economic aid 
and security guarantees to Ukraine. The Lisbon protocol was 
ratified without its article 5 which provided for Kiev's 
adherence to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a nuclear 
free state. 
  President Kravchuk on Tuesday called on parliament to 
approve 
the protocol in full, arguing that the tripartite Moscow 
agreement met all of the parliament's stipulations for ratifying 
the paper. 
  However, Goryn said the President's statement "goes beyond 
the framework of the parliamentary resolution."

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Kostenko, Ukraine's minister of </F>
environmental protection, head of the deputies' working group 
for issues of nuclear disarmament: "We Have Given Away $10 
Billion to Russia; This Time, It Will Be Even More" -- first 
paragraph published in boldface; passage between slantlines also 
published in boldface] 
  [Text] On 12 January, U.S. president Bill Clinton's 
aircraft touched down at Boryspil Airport. According to 
numerous preliminary tatements by presidential aides and 
advisers, as well as by the U.S. press, the visit had not been 
planned. The press hailed Bill Clinton's intention to visit 
Minsk and Moscow and asserted that he was not going to visit 
Kiev because Ukraine was not behaving properly on the nuclear 
issue. They said that Ukraine would later be summoned to Moscow 
for negotiations. However, the boss of the White House changed 
his decision -- Kiev's airport was the first of those of the 
former Soviet republics to receive him. The president took a 
step backward, but now he wants to take two, three, or four 
steps forward. 
  Against the background of the victory of Zhirinovskiy's 
party 
in Russia, the sensational reports on the total elimination of 
nuclear weapons in Ukraine do not only give rise to a series of 
questions, but also to the feeling of anxiety and uncertainty 
among the citizens of our, and not only our, state. 
  One cannot fail to see the perfectly obvious contradictions 
between the decisions adopted by the Supreme Council on the 
reduction of nuclear weapons deployed on Ukrainian land and some 
statements in the agreement about to be signed by the presidents 
of the three states. For example, in accordance with the 
Supreme Council decree on the ratification of START-1, Ukraine 
takes upon itself an obligation to destroy 42 percent of its 
nuclear warheads over seven years. Before he arrived in Kiev, 
Clinton declared in Brussels that all the warheads would be 
removed from our territory in the coming two or three years. 
Therefore, if such an agreement is signed, a quite logical 
question arises: "Why should Ukraine fulfill all those 
extremely unprofitable procedures for destroying strategic 
offensive weapons as envisaged by START-1? It is known that its 
theses were elaborated more than 10 years ago, when the USSR, 
which manufactured nuclear weapons, was still in existence." 
  The absence at that time of the effective mechanisms for 
control over the manufacture of nuclear warheads led to the 
elaboration of such operations for destroying strategic nuclear 
forces, which could be clearly pinpointed and controlled. It is 
precisely for that reason that, in accordance with the 
agreement, the account for destroyed strategic weapons is made 
in terms of dismantled launch vehicles and destroyed launch 
silos and not in terms of destroyed nuclear warheads. 
  Incidentally, with regard to the latter, the practice of 
dismantling a training launch silo in Pervomaysk showed that the 
real economic and ecological losses exceeded the worst 
predictions. All those who saw the photographic illustration of 
this barbaric action in IZVESTIYA of 11 January 1994 could judge 
for themselves. 
  Well, in view of the fact that Ukraine does not manufacture 
its own nuclear warheads, the removal of nuclear warheads from 
our territory also automatically signifies the elimination of 
the strategic offensive weapons. Even if entire strategic 
missiles remained in complete launch silos, with such a missile 
we would, perhaps, be able to launch, instead of a nuclear 
warhead, nothing more than nuclear waste from the Chernobyl 
sarcophagus. 
  However, here a clear position is necessary -- either we 
pursue a stage-by-stage reduction of our nuclear arsenals in 
accordance with previous terms, or destroy nuclear warheads 
alone without ruining those things that may still serve our 
state, namely the launch vehicles and the launch silos. 
Yet another important issue with regard to new initiatives is 
the problem of compensation for nuclear disarmament. The sum of 
material assistance promised by Mr. Clinton cannot be compared 
to the losses that Ukraine has sustained. I will analyze just 
one aspect of this problem. The highly enriched uranium and 
weapons-grade plutonium are the most valuable materials of the 
nuclear warhead. It is impossible to determine the market price 
of these materials, because their sale is forbidden by the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. At the same time, in 
accordance with some estimates, the known expenditure on the 
production of highly enriched uranium and plutonium are, 
respectively, up to $100,000 and up to $1 million per kilogram. 
Together with the tactical weapons, Ukraine has already handed 
over to Russia more than 50 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium, 
which, according to the minimum estimate, /is worth over $10 
billion. This indebtedness of Russia to Ukraine would be enough 
to compensate for the deliveries of energy resources to us for 
more than a year./ 
  As regards the new agreement, the proposals that the highly 
enriched uranium from the strategic missile warheads be 
processed at Russian enterprises and that Ukraine be repaid with 
low-grade uranium in the form of fuel for nuclear power stations 
are economically unprofitable for Ukraine. The low-grade 
uranium is worth about a hundredth of the highly-enriched 
uranium. On the other hand, in accordance with the concept of 
the development of nuclear power engineering in Ukraine, it 
would be economically expedient to manufacture our own fuel 
cartridges for the nuclear power stations. It would, therefore, 
be best to process highly enriched uranium in Ukraine. This is 
corroborated by the proposals from the well-known U.S. General 
Atomic Company, which proposed that a joint enterprise on 
manufacturing fuel for nuclear power stations be organized in 
Ukraine. 
  The cost of such an enterprise would be just $30 million. 
Besides, after completing the program for processing the highly- 
enriched uranium into low-grade uranium, this enterprise might 
be used within the technological cycle of our own capacities for 
manufacturing fuel for nuclear power stations. Unfortunately, 
the leadership of our state ignored these proposals. It is 
necessary to return to this issue. 
  One more commentary on the new initiatives. The fact that 
Ukraine is presently in a certain degree of international 
isolation is not due to nuclear weapons, as some people are 
trying to prove, but to the absence of any reforms. That is 
why, had there been conditions in Ukraine favorable for 
efficient entrepreneur activity and not stagnation with 
corruption and bribery, there would not have been such a thing 
as the so-called "Ukrainian syndrome," which allegedly scares 
away investors. 
  Speaking about the nuclear weapons of the former USSR, 
Western entrepreneurs and politicians are not so much concerned 
about the availability of nuclear weapons, as about the possible 
coming to power in Russia of Mr. Zhirinovskiy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anton Buteyko, Ukrainian presidential </F>
adviser, by Francoise Delstanche in Brussels on 18 January: 
"Kiev Expresses Its Faith in the Face of the Agreement on 
Denuclearization"; first four paragraphs are L'ECHO introduction] 
  [Text] Anton Buteyko believes that the West is focusing too 
much attention on nuclear affairs. Moderately optimistic about 
the nuclear agreement for the future since, according to him, 
the president has met Parliament's demands, Kravtchuk's adviser 
sees no progress being made on the dossier regarding the Black 
Sea fleet. 
  The tripartite agreement between the United States, Russia, 
and Ukraine, signed last Friday in Moscow, was saluted yesterday 
by the European Union as "an important contribution to 
international security and stability," albeit on condition that 
it be implemented rapidly, failing which any delay would be 
considered with great anxiety. 
  The practical implementation of the agreement effectively 
depends on the backing of the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev. Not 
directly, but with respect to the conditions that it imposed on 
the ratification of the Start I agreement on the reduction of 
strategic nuclear arms, and on the ratification of the treaty on 
nuclear non-proliferation, both of which Washington had laid 
down as preconditions. However, the Ukrainian leaders are 
proving relatively confident on these points. That is what was 
explained to us yesterday by Anton Buteyko in an interview given 
while passing through Brussels. However, he believes that the 
West is focussing too much attention on the nuclear problem and 
forgetting that other elements are emerging as definitely just 
as important. Consequently, he argues, the development of equal 
relations with the European Union would contribute to the 
stability of the region. 
  Moreover, in his opinion, only Ukraine can check the 
pressure 
in Russia caused by new political forces like that of 
Zhirinovskiy. For, in his view, the renaissance of these fascist 
movements is a menace not only to Ukraine, but also to Europe as 
a whole. 
  Delstanche: Do you think it will be easy to obtain 
the Ukrainian Parliament's support for the tripartite agreement 
on denuclearization? 
  Buteyko: The agreement does not formally require 
ratification. On the other hand, when Parliament ratified the 
Start I treaty, it voiced a certain number of reservations, in 
particular concerning the security guarantee for Ukraine, and 
the provision of technological and financial assistance in the 
context of disarmament. In fact, it must be clear that when 
Start I was negotiated, all the arms to be destroyed had to be 
eliminated using the combined economic resources of the USSR as 
a whole, whereas now we would have to destroy them using our own 
resources. That, however, is impossible in view of the economic 
crisis ravaging our country. Furthermore, the destruction of 
this arsenal will benefit the Western nations at which the arms 
in question were aimed. Therefore, it is logical that they 
should contribute to that process, for we are contributing to 
their security. Then again, Parliament has asked for 
compensation for the material contained in the tactical and 
strategic arms handed over to Russia. 
  In addition, it must be remembered that the negotiations 
were 
launched at the initiative of Ukraine, but that neither the 
United States nor Russia took our interests into account. It 
was Parliament's decision regarding the Start I treaty that 
provided a positive impulse in the negotiations. All the more 
so since we also understood that it was impossible to resolve 
certain matters on a bilateral basis. 
Horyn: Well, this high-ranking German official 
explained his idea in approximately this way. Ukraine is 
presently in a state of crisis. We do not have enough food. 
However, some 10 years will pass, and our state will finally be 
standing on its own two feet. It will be a competitor on 
European agricultural markets. At the same time, traditional 
exporters, such as Germany and France, will find themselves in a 
difficult situation.... 
  I replied to those arguments by saying that had Ukraine 
remained within the empire, the entire Europe would have been 
compelled to spend huge amounts of money on armaments in order 
to insure themselves against the imperial threat. Europe would 
have trembled before the Moscow empire as it did after World War 
II. 
  Ukraine is not only a dream of the people and the form of 
their survival. Ukraine is a factor of stability, peace, and 
de- imperialization in Europe. Ukraine must become a therapist 
of the imperial moods that prevail among the Russian people. 
The recent elections in Russia are disturbing. 
  Pasichnyy: After all, the consequences of the 
recent elections in Russia have again placed before the world a 
threat of direct invasion from Moscow. Chauvinism is still 
alive, and it has now acquired features of communo-fascism.... 
  Horyn: Yes, they showed that it is not only the 
ruling circles in the Kremlin that are infected with the virus 
of imperialism. Many Russians display deep nostalgia for the 
empire, because its very existence raised our neighbors in their 
own eyes. 
  The results of the elections in Russia have also contributed 
to a change in orientations in the West's attitude toward 
Ukraine. Instead of diktat, we see a striving for a dialogue. 
  Pasichnyy: Pan Mykhaylo, you, as chairman of 
Ukraine's Republican Party, are a candidate for deputy of the 
Supreme Council at the coming elections. What is the attitude 
of the Republicans toward Ukraine's nuclear status? 
  Horyn: We believe that the very fact of nuclear 
missiles in Ukraine is a guarantee for us and a warning for all 
of our neighbors that they should refrain from playing with 
fire. We are not opponents of disarmament and we are not 
against dismantling those missiles whose service life has 
expired. However, in our opinion, 46 missiles must be left and 
dismantled only after all nuclear powers make identical steps. 
  One more thing. Russia, after it received from us a large 
number of medium-range missiles, has not to this day paid us for 
the nuclear fuel -- this sum constitutes several billions of 
U.S. dollars. 
  I, for example, do not agree that, while dismantling the 
nuclear warheads, we should also be compelled to dismantle the 
missiles themselves. They are our separate property -- they 
were built at our factories. We will be able to use them to 
protect ourselves from territorial encroachments by aggressors. 
  I hope that the president will not hasten to sign the 
necessary documents that would fully disarm Ukraine. It would 
be an irreparable blunder.

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Not Everyone in Ukrainian Missile </F>
Forces Agrees With President Kravchuk"] 
  [Text] There is growing opposition within the Ukrainian 
Army -- as there is within parliament -- to the tripartite 
statement signed in Moscow by President Leonid Kravchuk, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  This IZVESTIYA correspondent has learned that, at a 
Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry Collegium session 21 January devoted to the 
training of military personnel in the country's higher 
educational establishments and the strengthening of discipline 
among the troops, Lieutenant General Vladimir Mikhtyuk, 
commander of the Strategic Missile Forces 43d Missile Army 
stationed in Vinnitsa, and Major General Nikolay Filatov, 
commander of the 46th Missile Division from Pervomaysk in 
Nikolayev Oblast, unexpectedly and without prior arrangement 
took the Ukrainian military oath. 
  Major General Rustam Karimov, commander of the 19th Missile 
Division stationed in Khmelnitskiy, refused to take the 
Ukrainian oath at this collegium session and stated that he 
would not even do so before his own combined unit -- where 40 
percent of the officers do not want to swear an oath of 
allegiance to a fatherland yet again. That accounts for 413 of 
the 1,017 officers in the division. Of these, 354 want to move 
to Russia for the rest of their service, while the others want 
to be discharged to the reserve and go to live back home. 
  Given that, before last Friday, the leading personnel of the 
missile army and missile divisions stationed in Ukraine as well 
as the overwhelming majority of other missile officers had not 
sworn loyalty to Ukraine, this step by the Defense Ministry 
Collegium is being seen by some observers as a direct challenge 
to the policy announced by President Leonid Kravchuk in the 
sphere of his state's nuclear missile disarmament, and as an 
attempt to complicate and delay this process as long as 
possible, to make it as unpredictable as possible, and to 
nullify cooperation with Russia in carrying out the START I and 
II treaties. 
  As is well known, there are 176 strategic RS-18 
liquid-propellant missiles (90 in Khmelnitskiy and 40 in 
Pervomaysk) and RS-22 solid-propellant (all 46 in Pervomaysk) 
launch systems with 1,250 nuclear warheads plus 650 air-launched 
cruise missile assemblies [bloki] in Ukraine. The Strategic 
Nuclear Forces Administrative Command and Control Center is 
located there, and the creation of nuclear space forces has been 
announced. 
  The elimination of the strategic nuclear complex along with 
the country's fulfillment of its commitments under the Lisbon 
Protocol to join the Nonproliferation Treaty as a nuclear-free 
state represents for many Ukrainian generals -- particularly 
those who had recently moved to top jobs in the Kiev Defense 
Ministry -- the complete end of their careers. They will 
naturally do all they can to prevent it. 
  Meanwhile the situation in the Ukrainian Missile Forces -- 
this is no secret to specialists -- remains very complex despite 
all the reassuring statements from Ukrainian generals. Many 
missile systems have come to the end of their warranty and 
inspection and maintenance [reglamentnyy] servicing period. The 
state does not have enough money to carry out the servicing. 
  In 1993 Ukrainian specialists stood down two RS-18 strategic 
missile regiments in Pervomaysk and Khmelnitskiy (10 RS-18's 
each). The nuclear warheads were dismantled and sent to 
technical storage bases, the missiles were removed from their 
silos, their oxidants and fuel were transferred to special 
tanks, and the missiles were loaded onto railcars and prepared 
for dispatch to "Yuzhmashzavod" in Dnepropetrovsk. 
But each dismantled missile still contains up to 100 kg of a 
highly toxic substance -- one of the components of the missile 
fuel. The equipment to degasify them does not exist, nor does 
the technology for processing the heptyl. The plant turned out 
not to be ready to receive these missiles. 
  It was necessary to remove them from the railcars and 
transfer the toxic liquids from the rail tanks into other 
containers. The dismantling of obsolete [vysluzhivshikh svoi 
sroki] missiles has been halted indefinitely. There are neither 
the warehouses, nor the specialized transportation, nor the 
funds to handle them. Officers are angry that they are being 
forced to do such a dangerous and senseless job. 
  Their service conditions and their pay are far lower than in 
Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces. For instance, a missile 
division commander in Ukraine earns 2.2 million 
coupons-karbovantsi a month. If this sum is expressed in 
Russian rubles [R] at the actual exchange rate (24 to 1), it 
turns out that a Ukrainian general is "valued" less than a 
Russian lieutenant -- who earned around R100,000 in December 
1993 and will have been earning 90 percent more as of January. 
Moreover, last month Ukraine's missile troops received their 
pay literally on the eve of the New Year, after major scandals 
at the Finance Ministry, and have not yet seen any money this 
January.

  [Text] The negotiations held by the U.S., Russian, and 
Ukrainian presidents in Moscow could have failed to take place 
or become an unofficial meeting if it had not been for the 
courage displayed by Bill Clinton, Boris Yeltsin, and Leonid 
Kravchuk. This particularly applies to the Ukrainian president. 
This was declared by U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Miller 
at a press conference organized today at the American House by 
the mass media. The tripartite agreement adopted in Moscow is 
an extremely important document opening broad perspectives in 
the sphere of nuclear disarmament, he emphasized. William 
Miller told the journalists about the negotiation processes that 
led up to signing this document conducted by representatives of 
the three states to coordinate nuclear disarmament efforts. The 
drive in favor of reduction and, later on, elimination of 
nuclear arsenals began in the late 1960's. Following the demise 
of the Soviet Union, this process not only continued but also 
[word indistinct]. Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan [word 
indistinct] safe regions. Of all these countries, Ukraine is 
the most central to the United States of America since almost 
all nuclear missiles stationed on its territory were targeted at 
the United States. I am happy that people who live in our 
countries can sigh with relief, because the threat that used to 
hang over our heads has blown over, the ambassador said. He 
described as very important the fact that the three presidents 
reached an agreement on procedures for transportation to Russia 
of nuclear warheads deployed in Ukraine based on compensation 
and security assurances. Ukraine will receive 100 metric tons 
of uranium for its nuclear power plants as compensation for the 
removal of the warheads.

  [Excerpts] Kiev, 25 Jan -- The Supreme Council of Ukraine 
began its session today under the chairmanship of Speaker Ivan 
Plyushch. [passage omitted] 
  With regard to the issue of Ukraine's accession to the 
nuclear arms nonproliferation treaty, Ivan Plyushch said that 
the last time parliament discussed the issue was on 18 November 
1993, when it adopted reservations concerning ratification of 
the START treaty. Since then, the president of Ukraine has 
carried out a great deal of work which resulted in the signing 
of the Moscow statement. 
  Plyushch said the president of Ukraine requested the Supreme 
Council to examine the issue of Ukraine's accession to the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty. However, the Supreme Council's 
three standing commissions which met 24 January with the 
participation of the working group dealing with ratification of 
the treaty, failed to find a common solution. 
  The parliament speaker said that this afternoon's session of 
the Supreme Council will look at the resolution on the state 
privatization program for 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmytro Ulas: "To Whom Does the Ukrainian Rocket </F>
Army Belong?" -- first paragraph published in boldface] 
  [Text] During the third year of our independence, we have 
finally learned that there are certain military units deployed 
on Ukrainian territory with servicemen who have not taken the 
oath of allegiance to the state that feeds, clothes, and 
provides housing for them. 
  In the era of the Soviet Union, communist propaganda would 
describe similar military units as occupying forces. Even if 
foreign armed forces were deployed on the territory of certain 
country, for example Germany, they were financed and provided 
with all necessities by the state that had sent them, and to 
which they had pledged allegiance. Americans have always made 
payments to the governments of those countries in which their 
Armed Forces have been deployed, even for use of the land. 
  Which military units deployed on Ukrainian soil pledged 
allegiance to the USSR, and are still living according to the 
laws of the deceased Union? No, this is not the Black Sea Fleet 
which has been proclaimed Ukraine's property following Russia's 
example, which has appropriated all former fleets of the USSR 
and property of units that were deployed outside the borders of 
the former Soviet Union. God bless the fleet, if no responsible 
official in Ukraine wants to even hear about its problems. 
  Yet, the subject of this article is different. This is the 
Vinnytsya Rocket Army, the weapons and property of which belong 
to Ukraine according to agreements between Russia and Ukraine, 
which have also been recognized by the international community. 
The paradox of the situation lies in the fact that missiles 
with nuclear warheads remain in the hands of those who continue 
to serve the nonexisting totalitarian state. 
  This can be confirmed by the fact that military leaders of 
the Army refuse to make officers and warrant officers take the 
oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people, and fail to sign 
contracts with those who consider themselves servicemen of the 
Russian Army. Even today, symbols of the former Soviet Union 
remain on the headquarters and barracks of certain units, and 
officers and warrant officers wear uniforms with emblems of the 
nonexistent Soviet Army. Perhaps they all expect that the past 
will return? Exactly the opposite. 
  This refuge of communist ideology is preserved thanks to the 
political speculations and intrigues of the Army leaders and top 
officials in divisions. They slyly gamble on today's hardships 
of officers and warrant officers, comparing Russians and 
Ukrainians. 
  Each time the issue of administering the oath of allegiance 
to Ukraine arises, insinuations of violating the rights of 
Russian servicemen appear, and rumors are spread that as soon as 
they take the oath they will have to return to Russia. 
  As a matter of fact, Russian troops are not going to leave 
until they sell the apartments provided them by the Defense 
Ministry. They are not pricing them too low, either: A 
one-bedroom apartment costs no less than $5,000. Let us figure 
the losses for our state. They curse Ukraine and threaten to 
drop from service, they do not leave their apartments, and they 
continue to consume their food rations and buy dollars with the 
money they receive from the Defense Ministry of Ukraine. This 
is the life of Russian soldiers according to the oath of 
allegiance to the Soviet Union, and nobody knows exactly who 
they serve. 
  However, the last statement is not completely true, since at 
the beginning of November, the defense minister of the Russian 
Federation inspected the combat readiness of the units and 
conducted a training exercise for commanders of the Rocket Army 
of Ukraine. How can one understand this? What will the 
commander in chief of the Ukraine's Armed Forces say on this 
occasion?

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Martsynovskyy: "Missiles on Target. </F>
Ukrainian Nuclear Weapons Are Among the Main Objectives in 
Moscow's Offensive External Policy" -- first paragraph published 
in boldface] 
  [Text] It would be naive to believe that our missiles 
constitute a military threat for Russia. These missiles are 
under the operational control of Russia's Strategic Missile 
Troops headquarters; they are serviced by Russian specialists 
alongside Ukrainian ones; our military doctrine does not 
envisage first nuclear strike, and so forth. Notwithstanding 
this, Russia seeks Ukraine's nuclear disarmament as soon as 
possible and the "missiles issue" remains a stumbling-block in 
relations between Ukraine and Russia. 
  Moscow is developing vigorous activity. Taking advantage of 
its prestige (more specifically, our lack of prestige) in the 
world, it does everything it can to continue playing the role of 
a big brother who holds the younger brother's hand and keeps 
pointing at him: "A naughty boy!" This negative image of 
Ukraine, the image of a minor nuclear aggressor is also steadily 
being created by the Russian mass media, which are readily 
quoted by the West. The world community is being encouraged to 
put pressure upon Ukraine. An appeal was recently issued by 
Russian designers, scientists, and specialists of the Atomic 
Energy Ministry [Minatom] to citizens and governments of world 
states, in which the Russians intimidated those governments with 
the dangerous state of Ukrainian nuclear warheads. All the 
numerous statements by high-ranking Ukrainian politicians and 
military figures on the groundlessness of such assertions do not 
produce any special effect and constitute, figuratively 
speaking, whispers against a background of Russian loudspeakers. 
  Russia's official argument in this political struggle is the 
dangerous state of our missiles. Having pointed out that our 
politicians (people's deputy Serhiy Semenets, co-chairman of the 
group for studying aspects of ratifying START-1: "Emergency 
Situations Are Impossible") and military figures (Minister of 
Defense Vitaliy Radetskyy: "The State of Missile Facilities Is 
Satisfactory") have a different opinion, we will proceed to some 
other, more spontaneous, methods resorted to by Moscow for 
attaining Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. 
  If Ukraine gets rid of its missiles, Russia will become the 
only nuclear power in the region of Central and Eastern Europe. 
This will also give it the traditional and desired possibility 
to be at the top. The Russian desire to be in control is more 
than obvious: For example, Russia's nervous reaction to plans by 
Poland, Hungary, and Czechia to join NATO was very revealing. 
If such plans are implemented, the alignment of forces promoted 
in the region will not be in Russia's best interests. At a 
recent (1 December 1993) CSCE conference in Rome, Russia 
demanded that the mandate of a peacekeeper in CIS countries be 
given to it -- not a single country supported that initiative. 
Fortunately for us, because that mandate, alongside statements 
by Russian politicians, in particular, Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Andrey Kozyrev ("Russia must actively defend the rights 
of the Russian-speaking population, using rapid- deployment 
forces for the purpose"), would give our neighbors an 
opportunity for large-scale activities, since (again, from 
Moscow's point of view) that "Russian-speaking population" is 
abused in almost every former Union republic. Thus, Russia is 
clearly striving to gain control of the region, and Ukrainian 
missiles, which are presently a real factor of deterrence, do 
not in any way suit its "far-reaching" plans. 
  Another factor of Russian impatience is totally prosaic -- 
the cost of the content of the Ukrainian warheads. This amounts 
to billions of U.S. dollars. That is why Russia demands that 
the warheads be transferred precisely to it. Kazakhstan, which 
had hitherto been "quiet," played a dirty trick on Moscow: On 
13 December, an American-Kazakhstan agreement was signed -- the 
Americans want to buy the entire uranium content of Kazakhstan's 
missiles. That uranium is worth about $1 billion; therefore, 
this money is flowing under Russia's nose into Kazakhstan's 
treasury. Moscow newspapers immediately called Kazakhstan's 
missiles "in fact, Russian property" and regretted that 
Ukraine's uncompromising position is having such a bad influence 
upon Kazakhstan's behavior. Therefore, Russia's striving to get 
hold of Ukrainian warheads is perfectly understandable, as is 
also Moscow's anxiety on this point: There is no agreement 
between Ukraine and Russia on transferring warheads to Russian 
plants. 
  Russia's reaction to our parliament's decree on ratifying 
START-1 was all the more negative. At that time, Moscow 
resembled a furious fisherman looking at yet another empty hook. 
Kozyrev demonstratively refused to receive our Ambassador 
Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy. The aforementioned appeal by Russian 
scientists to the world was quickly arranged. The Moscow press, 
having stopped pouring dirt by buckets, opened all the taps on 
the tank. 
  A few words on the decree itself. It is quite obvious that 
this document cannot be assessed in a simple way. Yes, despite 
previous promises, we have actually become a nuclear power, 
although temporarily so; yes, the decree is at variance with 
some articles of the Lisbon Protocol under which our president's 
signature appears; yes, the document itself, from the point of 
view of politicians, contains rather naive points regarding 
security guarantees for Ukraine. However, it is pointless to 
assert either the wisdom or worthlessness of that document, 
proceeding from immediate considerations alone: Doubtless the 
future, perhaps, not so distant, will provide such an 
assessment. Let me remind you that the deputies almost 
unanimously (what a surprise!) approved the reduction, over 
seven years, of 36 percent of launch vehicles and 42 percent of 
warheads. They [the deputies] advanced conditions to the world: 
Never use nuclear weapons against Ukraine; do not use 
conventional armed forces against it, and do not resort to the 
threat of force; refrain from exerting economic pressure for the 
purpose of resolving any disputes; respect Ukraine's territorial 
integrity and inviolability of borders. By the time the decree 
was adopted, Ukraine had 176 vertical-launch installations with 
1,240 nuclear warheads and 43 heavy bombers with 372 nuclear 
warheads. 
  That the position of the Ukrainian parliament should not be 
characterized in categorically negative terms was soon confirmed 
by the Russian elections in which Zhirinovskiy, a "sincere 
friend" of the former imperial colonies, triumphed. 
Anti-Ukrainian articles on nuclear topics immediately 
disappeared from Moscow newspapers (apparently, not for long). 
The world became concerned and a question arose: Is it 
generally safe to transfer the Union's nuclear weapons to 
Russia? At any rate, the warheads of 17 missiles that were 
deactivated by Ukraine at the end of December have remained "at 
home." At other times, this would have given rise to certain 
emotions in Russia. Now, there is complete tranquility. Maybe, 
the United States will also revise its policy with regard to 
Ukraine. So far, it only listened to what Russia was saying. 
  According to [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine 
will continue to adhere to its decision to become a nuclear-free 
state, but we will demand that a tripartite agreement be 
concluded with Russia and the United States. Meanwhile, an 
opinion is being formed among Ukrainian parliamentarians on the 
need for Ukraine to gain full control of its missiles: Such 
control on the part of Russia is dangerous for our country. It 
is significant that there is no nonaggression agreement between 
the two states. Besides, Russia's military doctrine envisages a 
preventive nuclear strike against nuclear countries. 
Technically speaking, according to specialists, it is not a 
major problem for Ukraine to gain positive control over the 
missiles. The problem is, rather, a political one. 
  Without doubt, we are in favor of a nuclear-free world. 
However, at present, a number of political and economic 
considerations prompt us to refrain from hasty steps, such as 
was the proclamation of the country's nuclear-free status at the 
dawn of our independence. At any rate, the fulfillment of the 
parliament's decree has already started, and this is a specific 
step toward a nuclear-free Ukraine.

  [Text] Nuclear weapons, whose shelf life is reaching its 
upper limit, can now pose a threat to Ukraine. Kostyantyn 
Hryshchenko, head of the directorate of control over armaments 
and disarmament of Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
stressed this during a meeting with journalists on 18 January. 
He emphasized that all components necessary for the safe 
storage of nuclear weapons, hydrogen absorbers in particular, 
are manufactured in Russia and until recently were not being 
supplied to Ukraine. Hryshchenko noted that this led to the 
storage of nuclear weapons becoming increasingly unstable. The 
threat was gradually increasing and demanded a resolution. In 
the opinion of the representative from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, after Ukraine's experience with Chernobyl it would be 
extremely irresponsible not to take this situation into account.

scientific products to be traded abroad. Recently, we have 
learned why "Konza" protected itself from excessive public 
scrutiny. After its inception, "Konza" created a territorial 
innovation center called "Agrotekhnopark" in Brody, Lvov Oblast. 
This center was established at a former missile base with an 
area of 320 hectares. The base is located in a fenced-in patch 
of forest and includes a three-story former command post, a 
two-story former headquarters building, two-story hotel, seven 
military barracks, privates' and officers' canteens, a medical 
center, enormous depots, a sauna, garages, and other facilities 
which can ensure maintenance of this huge military center. 
[passage omitted] 
  A document was signed to hand over this former military base 
to "Konza" and the site is currently protected by some 40 
guards. In the opinion of People's Deputy Chobit, Ukrainian 
President Kravchuk should initiate an official investigation 
into this case because, at the beginning, it was presumed that 
the base would be turned over to the National Guard of Ukraine. 
So, why has "Konza" become the proprietor of this facility? 
Why has the former military base not been sold at auction? Why 
has "Konza" completed this deal so hastily?

  [Text] Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis 
proposed the establishment of an arms-control system for the 
Mediterranean. Arsenis outlined his proposal during an address 
at an international seminar titled "Armament Limitation and 
Security in the Middle East," which was held in Athens by the 
International Relations Institute of Pandion University of 
Athens and the University of California's Institute of 
International Conflict and Cooperation. 
  Arsenis said that this arms-control system could be based on 
the principle of territorial integrity, inviolate borders, the 
peaceful settlement of disputes, and not using force. Greece, 
he added, is particularly worried about the issue of nuclear 
weapons in Central Asia and the Middle East and Turkey's 
interest in these weapons, given that, since the breakup of the 
Soviet Union, the possibilities for nuclear proliferation have 
increased, as have the possibilities for the spread of nuclear 
technology and know-how to unstable regions.

  [Text] New details have been revealed today of Bonn's 
efforts to change the guidelines on German arms exports. 
According to these details, the government, too, is seeking to 
make arms exports easier. According to information obtained by 
our Bonn office, talks on this have been conducted between the 
Defense, Economics, and Foreign Ministries. Yesterday the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] 
parliamentary group spoke in favor of easing the export 
provisions. The Social Democratic Party [SPD] announced its 
resistance to this. Gerd H. Pelletier reports. 
  Pelletier: One day after the move forward by CDU 
deputies toward relaxing the arms export provisions, today it 
was revealed that the ministries concerned -- defense, 
economics, and foreign -- have been dealing with the European 
harmonization of the tricky issue for weeks already. The 
confidential file has lain at the Federal Chancellery since 
before the Christmas period. It says that a ruling on dual-use 
exports is urgent. For example, we have the case of the Libyan 
toxic gas factory in Rabta, which the German company Imhausen 
Chemie claimed was a fertilizer plant. When the deal was 
uncovered, company head Hippenstiel was sentenced and 
regulations on granting export permits were tightened 
drastically. All-European guidelines are being called for in 
this area. But Ruehe's Defense Ministry also wants to make it 
easier for the arms industry to export. 
  Kinkel's Foreign ministry, however, would prefer to adhere 
to 
the Arms Export Control Act of 1982. For example, if the 
British partners require the future Eurofighter to be 
desertworthy, the German manufacturing partners will know that 
it was to be sold outside the NATO area. Must our arms export 
restrictions be relaxed for that reason? 
  [Begin Kinkel recording] For some time we have been 
considering in the responsible ministries -- in cooperation 
between the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry -- how we 
can deal with this sticky issue. We mustn't rush at it. We 
will look at the CDU/CSU proposals, which have now been 
submitted, in addition to our own ideas, and then decide in good 
time. [end recording] 
  Pelletier: The arms industry does not want to wait 
that long. European reality: The company Eurocopter is a DASA 
enterprise with French majority ownership. The German partners 
cannot and do not want to know where the French parent company, 
Aerospatiale, is selling the combat helicopters. Whatever 
happens, it is thought less likely that the European partners 
will give in to the cautious German arms export restrictions in 
the short or long term. It is more likely that the compromise 
will lie in the gradual relaxing of these German provisions.

<F P=106> ["K.B." report: "Unexpected Protest Against Easier Arms </F>
Exports"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 5 January -- Several leading members of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] 
Bundestag group have criticized foreign policy spokesman Lamers 
for his statements on arms export controls. Lamers had demanded 
the establishment of common European export rules. This would 
make arms exports easier than they are in line with the current 
German regulations. The Federal Government, too, is skeptical 
about this suggestion. So far, it has been assumed that a 
memorandum of the Foreign Policy Working Group, headlined 
"Common European Defense -- Common Arms Market -- Common Arms 
Export Policy," which was drawn up with Lamers' participation, 
meets with approval by the Bundestag group. This memorandum, 
which was published at the end of November, is now causing 
excitement with some delay. On Wednesday deputy group chairman 
Gerster came out against loosening the German export rules. 
Before one can think of approving regulated arms exports along 
broader lines and for larger areas, one must emphatically 
counteract excessive illegal deliveries of armament materiel in 
an internationally coordinated action. CDU Deputy Eppelmann, 
the former GDR defense minister, thinks that it is rather 
necessary to tighten the arms export rules instead of loosening 
them. 
  In order to combat illegal arms trade, Gerster demands 
additional legal regulations. It must be possible to use 
findings by the Federal Intelligence Office [BND] gained from 
monitoring against German arms dealers in court. Germany must 
not become the turntable for weapons from the former East Bloc. 
Therefore, checks at the borders must be tightened not only by 
the Customs Administration and the Federal Border Police, but 
also with the help of the Bundeswehr. 
  Eppelmann criticized the proposal by Lamers and the Foreign 
Policy Working Group for not aiming at solving conflicts. 
Lamers does not speak of disarmament. The working group seems 
to want to resign itself to the current conditions. 
  As was confirmed on Wednesday, the Federal Government does 
not intend to follow the demand for loosening the export 
guidelines and export control regulations. However, there are 
indications of considerations to change the examination and 
licensing procedures with the final decision in the Federal 
Security Council. This is aimed at making the German armament 
industry more able to cooperate in Europe. This would be a 
reaction to complaints from the armament industry that purely 
private cooperation projects between German and European 
companies are delayed so much by the licensing procedures that 
German companies are on the brink of becoming incapable of 
cooperation. The procedures should be made equal to those for 
the smoother official cooperation projects initiated by the 
state. 
  In the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] it has been 
confirmed that it opposes any loosening of regulations both for 
arms exports as well as for civilian supplies that can be used 
for armament. SPD economic expert Schwanhold said that the 
Military Materiel Control Law and the Foreign Trade Law must 
continue to be handled strictly. The strict German rules 
should, if possible, become the standard for harmonization in 
the European Union. The goal of German policy in the new role 
of the country must be worldwide disarmament and the conversion 
of armament industries to civilian production facilities. 
Deputy SPD Chairwoman Wieczorek- Zeul said that arms exports 
cannot safeguard Germany as an industrial location. Arms 
exports would only hurt Germany's reputation in the world.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Geneva January 25 TASS -- Will nuclear weapons 
testing grounds be finally closed? The solution of this 
problem, on which politicians, military leaders and diplomats 
have been racking their brains for several past decades, may be 
brought closer by the annual session of the UN disarmament 
conference, which opened here today. 
  Having completed in 1992 the elaboration of a convention to 
ban chemical weapons, it is now getting down to the discussion 
of the problem of an all-embracing ban on nuclear tests. The 
session is being attended by delegations from 37 states-members 
of the conference, including Russia. 
  "The banning of tests is a very important measure, primarily 
from the viewpoint of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," 
Grigoriy Berdennikov, Russia's permanent representative, told 
ITAR-TASS. "It is not a matter of concluding a treaty among the 
nuclear powers alone, but a matter of complete and universal 
prohibition of tests in all the countries of the world. This 
will guarantee us against the emergence of a new possessor of 
nuclear weapons." 
  The Geneva session is particularly important in light of 
current preparations for a conference of signatories of the 
nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty, scheduled for 1995. 
This conference may adopt a decision to prolong the treaty 
forever. 
  "The idea of fully banning nuclear tests was advanced by 
Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954. We have traditionally backed this 
initiative," Berdennikov added. "The treaty to ban tests in 
three media was concluded in 1963. We have also signed a treaty 
with the Americans to restrict the yield of nuclear tests. We 
are observing a moratorium on tests for several years now. 
Everybody admits that it has created a good background for 
talks in Geneva." 
  "The main problem after the end of the `Cold War' is to save 
the world from the `spreading' of mass destruction weapons and 
means for their delivery," the Russian representative said. "It 
is very important to reach agreement on security guarantees to 
non-nuclear state and on stopping the output of fissionable 
materials. The current session of the conference will also 
focus its attention on these problems."

  [Text] Geneva, Jan 25 (AFP) -- The 39-nation UN Conference 
on Disarmament opened here Tuesday with French Ambassador Gerard 
Errera denouncing North Korea's refusal to allow international 
inspections of its nuclear sites. 
  Errera, chairman of the conference, said Pyongyang's refusal 
cannot be "treated as only a regional issue." 
  He said the world's major nuclear powers -- the United 
States, Russia, France, Britain and China -- could not "accept 
to impose nuclear constraints on themselves if other countries 
continue to secretly develop nuclear weapons programs." 
  North Korea suspended inspections of its nuclear sites by 
the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in January 1993 and 
three months later threatened to pull-out of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, sparking fears that it was developing 
or had already developed a nuclear bomb. 
  Errera added that Iraq had also raised fears within the 
international community that it was developing its nuclear 
capability and that the breakup of the Soviet Union was 
threatening the implementation of the non-proliferation treaty. 
  There are fears that stocks of fissionable material have 
been 
sold or otherwise channelled from former Soviet bloc countries 
to countries secretly engaged in nuclear research. 
  The UN conference here, aimed at securing pledges from the 
nuclear powers for a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT), is to 
set up an ad-hoc committee to negotiate the treaty. 
  The United States has already expressed reservations about 
Iraq being a member. 
  UN representative Vladimir Petrovskiy said Tuesday that he 
would be in favor of enlarging the committee to include 
additional members. 
  Errera, in his opening statement, also said that "today's 
reality does not reflect the past where two superpowers could 
negotiate between themselves a disarmament treaty and then 
present it for ratification by the international community." 
  The five nuclear powers nevertheless have their own 
reservations about a CTBT. 
  The United States, Russia, France and Britain have for 
example suspended their tests, whereas China carried out an 
explosion as recently as last October and appears in no hurry to 
conclude testing. 
  In any event, signing a test ban treaty would in no way 
imply 
that the nuclear five were ready to give up their nuclear 
stockpiles or abandon the doctrine of nuclear deterrence. 
  Errera said he could not predict how long the conference 
would last. "The main thing is that the talks should be taken 
seriously so that we can work towards a treaty acceptable to 
everybody." 
  It appeared unlikely that they would conclude before the 
1995 
expiry date of the current Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) which the western powers wish to extend for a period of 
several years.

  [Text] Geneva, Jan. 25 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
appeared at odds Tuesday [25 January] over whether to include 
North Korea, Iraq and 21 other nations in an expanded conference 
on disarmament. 
  The United Nations-backed conference opened Tuesday to 
discuss a total ban on nuclear weapons tests, while suggestions 
of expanding the 37-member conference to 60 divided the meeting. 
  John Holum, director of the U.S. Arms Control and 
Disarmament 
Agency, said it would be important for an expanded conference to 
include the nations that are suspected of trying to develop 
nuclear weapons. 
  Japanese Government sources, without specifically mentioning 
North Korea, said Japan cannot agree to allowing into the 
conference nations with which there are problems with the 
inspections of nuclear facilities by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) and problems with executing disarmament 
related treaties. 
  North Korea has repeatedly denied that it is attempting to 
develop an atomic bomb, but its refusal to permit IAEA and 
inter-Korean inspections of its facilities has aroused suspicion 
about its motives. 
  While the U.S. was apparently indicating no objection to 
adding North Korea to the conference, it did indicate that it 
would be opposed to including Iraq, against which the U.S. led a 
multinational coalition against [as received] in the 1991 
Persian Gulf war.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, 24 Jan -- The Japanese Government expects to 
conclude by March this year outline agreements with three 
republics of the former Soviet Union, excluding Russia, on 
assistance in scrapping the nuclear weapons they have inherited 
after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The ITAR-TASS 
correspondent learned this today at the Japanese Foreign 
Ministry. 
  In the words of a member of the disarmament section at the 
Japanese Foreign Ministry, diplomats from Tokyo are conducting 
talks in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to decide what share 
each of the three republic is to receive of the $100 million 
Japan allocated to the CIS in April 1993 to facilitate the 
scrapping of nuclear weapons and the utilization of radioactive 
waste. 
  The Japanese assistance is to be directed toward 
facilitating 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections at 
military and civilian nuclear facilities in these countries, and 
toward ensuring the safe storage of fissile materials. Specific 
programs will also envisage sending to the spot Japanese 
specialists from nuclear power stations and nuclear waste 
depositories, as well as teaching Japanese experience to local 
staff. 
  Tokyo has decided to expedite the process of drafting 
outline 
agreements in view of the fact that Ukraine and Kazakhstan have 
recently adopted a constructive stand concerning accession to 
the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty, and that Kiev has 
guaranteed the withdrawal of this type of weapons from its 
territory.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginia Silveira: "Resumption of Space Program"] </F>
  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos--The Brazilian space program has 
received incentives this year [1993] for speeding its 
development of satellites through the use of funds from the 
Federal Government's privatization program. The China-Brazil 
Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) project and the Complete 
Brazilian Space Mission (MECB) have a guaranteed appropriation 
of $85 million for the coming two years. 
  Of that total, about $21 million is already available this 
year for the Chinese-Brazilian project, and another $15 million 
will be available for the period from 1994 to 1996. The first 
portion of the money was advanced by the Bank of Brazil at the 
end of October. The funds were obtained from an agreement signed 
between the Bank of Brazil, the Ministry of Science and 
Technology, and the Funding Authority for Studies and Projects 
(Finep). 
  According to Carlos Santana, manager of the CBERS, release 
of 
the $21 million will make it possible to resume the program by 
contracting with firms to supply the electronic and mechanical 
equipment for the satellites. The National Institute of Space 
Research (INPE), which is developing one-third of the project in 
cooperation with China, has already issued seven invitations to 
bid in order to put together the group of firms that will 
participate in the program. 
  At present, eight firms are working with the INPE on the 
Chinese-Brazilian project. They are: Tecnasa Professional 
Electronics, Elebra Defense and Control Systems, Esca 
Telecommunications, Composite Technology, Aeroelectronics, 
Brazilian Nuclear Industries, Digicon, and Embraer. 
  According to Santana, the new contracts being worked out 
with 
the other firms are concerned with electronic and mechanical 
equipment for the following satellite subsystems: power supply, 
mechanical structure, image transmitter, data collection 
transmitter, antennas, and UHF transmitter. 
  According to manager Santana, Brazilian countertrade in 
connection with the Chinese-Brazilian program this year has made 
it easier to expand the space agreement with China. In the first 
week of November, the two countries signed a new memorandum of 
intent to carry out a joint study of the feasibility of 
communications satellites. 
  According to Santana, the new technological cooperation 
agreement with China also calls for launching a scientific 
satellite, to be built by the INPE, in conjunction with the 
first satellite in the CBERS series in October 1996. The 
Brazilian share of the launching is budgeted at $15 million. 
  The launch contract was signed early this month between the 
INPE, Finep, and China's Great Wall firm. It also includes an 
offset agreement ensuring Brazil of exports in the same amount 
as the deal reached with China. The remote sensing satellites 
will be launched using Great Wall's Long March IV rocket. The 
satellite weighs 1,500 kg and has an estimated useful life of 10 
years. 
  Construction of the scientific satellite, which will be 
carried on board SSR-1, will be financed by Finep and will cost 
a total of $4 million. According to Santana, the satellite will 
use the same technology as that developed for the data 
collection satellite, and its mission will be to conduct 
research in the electromagnetic field of the ionosphere and 
X-rays and gamma rays. 
  Under the terms of the agreement signed with China in 1988, 
Brazil's share of the CBERS program amounts to $50 million, or 
30 percent of the project. It will be up to the INPE to develop 
one of the cameras for the satellite's observation system, the 
flight structure, the mechanical model, and the telemetry and 
communications transponder. 
  The mission of the remote sensing satellites will be to 
photograph the planet for the purpose of observing land use and 
mapping the soil's natural and mineral resources and also to 
sense climatic changes in specific areas. The satellites will 
also make it possible to improve agricultural activities by the 
use of space technology to forecast harvests and planting. 
  The INPE's program to develop satellites is also supported 
by 
a $24.7 million line of credit extended by Finep. That financing 
will be used to pay the firms participating in the satellite 
program, with the funds to be released over the next two years, 
according to Marcio Nogueira Barbosa, director of the INPE. 
  The INPE expects at least 13 contracts to be covered by 
Finep 
financing. According to the timetable for releasing funds from 
that line of credit, the firms already hired and those approved 
in future bidding will receive $7.5 million this year. Another 
$11.1 million is expected in 1994, followed by $6 million in 
1995. 
  According to Barbosa, the funds from Finep will make it 
possible to complete part of the work planned in connection with 
the MECB and the CBERS, which have experienced constant setbacks 
because of delays in paying the firms involved.

  [Text] The Chilean Government has become a full member of 
the Tlatelolco Treaty that proscribes nuclear weapons in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. Ambassador Carlos Portales signed the 
document for the president of the Republic. 
  The Chilean Government also has joined the organization 
supervising the treaty -- the Organization to Ban Nuclear 
Weapons in Latin America, OPANAL. The ceremony took place in 
Mexico City. Argentina joined the treaty during the same 
ceremony. 
  Portales said on the occasion that Chile emphasizes its 
complete renunciation and repudiation of the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, adding that the country will 
contribute with initiatives seeking to prevent the proliferation 
of these types of weapons. 
  Chile ratified the Tlatelolco Treaty in October 1974, seven 
years after signing it. Its implementation, however, was 
suspended because Chile considered that all countries with 
nuclear programs in the region had to become an effective part 
of the agreement.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Jan (MENA)--AL-AHRAM writes that the 
United Nations' efforts to disarm Iraq, which are part of the 
preparations to implement long-term monitoring of Iraq's 
armament, again raise the issue of controlling nuclear, 
conventional, and nonconventional armaments in the Middle East. 
  The paper recalls the Security Council resolutions that said 
disarming Iraq should be part of a process to rid the Middle 
East of all weapons of mass destruction and to establish a new 
security order in the region. 
  While acknowledging that the effort to control armaments in 
the region is primarily linked with an Arab-Israeli settlement, 
the paper, in its editorial today, adds that the part of these 
resolutions that has been implemented involves Iraq alone. 
  AL-AHRAM stresses that the Iraqi threat, which some parties 
used as an excuse in the past, no longer exists. It adds: 
Further, achieving progress in the efforts to control armaments 
will necessarily create a better climate for boosting the 
overall settlement process.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Engineer Muhammad al-Ghamrawi, </F>
minister of state for war production, by Jamal Kamal; place and 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Kamal: Why is there interest in 
developing and enhancing the war industry when Egypt, the 
region, and the world are embarking on a new stage of peace in 
which certain restrictions are being imposed to control 
armaments and producing countries that monopolize on weapons 
production are calling for restrictions on the transfer of arms 
production technology? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: I have been asked these questions 
many times, even by people working in war production. I always 
answered with another question: Why should the Armed Forces be 
maintained and why should there be a constant call for 
developing and upgrading these forces? 
  If peace is the goal a state seeks to achieve and maintain 
to 
curb political and military tension and therefore provide more 
favorable conditions for best use of its resources to enhance 
the state's strength and enable it to continue its march toward 
progress, there must be a power to protect that peace. A 
general rule in the military, though, says that if you want 
peace you should be ready for war. Whoever advocates peace and 
tries to protect it through his own weakness would be signing 
his own death warrant. It is wrong to think that peace means 
doing away with or reducing the numbers of the armed forces 
because they are no longer needed for pursuing the state's 
national interests. The truth is that the lack of power makes 
the state a prey for ambitious persons and vulnerable to various 
risks at all times. This creates domestic instability and 
directly affects development plans. [passage omitted] 
  Kamal: But there are international calls to 
control armaments and curb the expansion of war production. 
Steps have actually been taken to prevent the export of arms 
production technology. 
  Al-Ghamrawi: What is being said about controlling 
armaments or curbing expansion in military production is meant 
to make the various forms of war production exclusive to a group 
of states that monopolize it and control its prices. 
  The best evidence of this can be found in the fact that the 
major states' arms exports to the Third World in two years alone 
exceeded arms exports for 10 years. Besides, what does armament 
control have to do with developing your military industry, if 
your goal is to satisfy the needs of your Armed Forces and 
develop the equipment they already have? Developing the 
military industry does not mean exporting it or trading in it in 
a way that undermines stability. [passage omitted] 
  Kamal: What is the major goal behind the 
development of the Egyptian military industry? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: The goal is to enhance the ties 
between the Ministry of War Production and the Ministry of 
Defense, which is the main user of military products. In other 
words, we want to provide for the needs of the Armed Forces and 
to link our plan for production to the Armed Forces' armament 
plan. [passage omitted] 
  Kamal: How can Egyptian military production be 
developed while there are restrictions on the transfer of arms 
production technology? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: This is an important issue that forms 
a large part of the new development strategy. This strategy is 
based on a new reading of the actual situation and on developing 
a new vision to cope with that situation. 
  Egypt's moderate policy and its belief in mutual interests 
and interrelation has helped it acquire many technologies 
without fear of abusing them. Egypt succeeded in acquiring the 
latest technologies from the United States, France, and some 
East European states. Our moderation provides us with the 
needed grounds to obtain what we want. 
  As for our vision, it is based on two main factors: 
  1. To utilize what we already have. 
  2. To develop and update what we already have and conduct 
further research. [passage omitted] 
Kamal: What are the markets for Egyptian weapons 
under the current international competition? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: The Arab and African states. I think 
that with some political effort we can find the best marketing 
formula so that the revenue can be spent on developing the 
weapons. 
  Kamal: Do you think it is possible in the current 
situation in the Arab world to establish an Arab military 
industry? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: I still believe that Arab states have 
many capabilities to cooperate in military industry without 
fear. We are capable of entering the sphere of military 
production with products that meet international levels. 
  Kamal: Why do foreign papers attack the M-1 tank 
factory every now and then? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: The Egyptian factory for the 
production and repair of armored vehicles-which began with the 
production of the U.S. M-1 tank--was a considerable addition to 
the power of Egyptian military production. It is one of the 
most modern military factories built in the world recently. 
Military industries are always questioned and are subjected to 
attacks every now and then. It seems that Egypt's and its 
workers' success in building the factory and absorbing the tank 
manufacturing technology, the peak of military technologies, 
frightens some people. But we will go on with the project 
according to plan. 
  Kamal: But the project will be completed in 1997. 
Does this mean that the production license will be withdrawn 
and the factory closed? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: There is no such thing as withdrawing 
a production license. The hypothetical shelf life of the tank 
is 20 to 25 years. Tanks in general need overhauls, 
maintenance, and development. The M-1 tank we are manufacturing 
is only a developed version of the M-60-A-3. There is also the 
M-1-A-2. Moreover, can anyone take back from you the technology 
you have learned? 
  We started the overhauling of the M-60-A-3 in the factory 
and 
we will start the overhauling of the M-1. We are studying how 
to meet new demands. A joint study is under way with the Armed 
Forces to select an armored combat vehicle to be manufactured in 
the factory. 
  Kamal: Since the 122-mm and 130-mm guns were 
manufactured, the Egyptian artillery factory has not produced 
new pieces of artillery. Why? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: We obtained a license to manufacture 
the 120-mm barrel of the M-1 tank in the artillery factory. 
This is one of the latest technologies in the world and it is 
different from that of ordinary artillery. There is also a 
project to produce the strategic steel needed for the artillery 
industry in the factory. 
  Kamal: Some foreign newspapers once in a while 
report that Egypt is producing chemical weapons. 
  Al-Ghamrawi: We have an established and unchanging 
principle: We do not manufacture any type of chemical weapons. 
We only manufacture the equipment needed to protect ourselves 
against these weapons. 
  Kamal: Some people talk about the need to 
privatize military production. 
  Al-Ghamrawi: Privatizing the war industry is out 
of the question. Like the Armed Forces, war production is one 
of the elements of Egyptian power and national security. If it 
is not possible to buy security from any state, then war 
production cannot be sold. Privatization is unsuitable for war 
production. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement by Russia's President Boris Yeltsin at news </F>
conference in Moscow -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, I shall come to the 
main point straight away. U.S. President Clinton's first visit 
to Russia has passed off very fruitfully. It could not have 
been otherwise: we know one another too well, there was too much 
that had to be done, and our peoples too were expecting much of 
us. This visit is based upon the realities of today, and at the 
same time looks to the future. As regards the difficult past, 
the U.S. President and I closed that book very firmly back in 
Vancouver. 
  The work in Moscow proceeded at a tense pace, and 
purposefully. Specific accords and agreements have been reached 
which are important both for Russia and for the United 
States--and for the whole world. The negotiations took place at 
a crucial time for our country. The old habits and stereotypes 
are crumbling, an active search for something new is under way 
both in our country and in the United States. 
  We could be said to be in the throes of a common 
Russo-American revolution. The citizens of the Russian 
Federation approved a new constitution at free and democratic 
elections, and for the first time elected their own parliament 
without duress. I do not agree with those who think that our 
first attempt was a flop. If one looks deeper than the 
individual names and popularist slogans, then all in all, the 
people have opted for a better life, for legality, and for 
predictability. 
  This is a lesson which we all still have to learn from in 
order to prevent mistakes being repeated. I confirmed quite 
definitely to the U.S. President that our course is aimed at the 
development and deepening of the reforms, and with stepping up 
social orientation. I am sure that the country will gain more 
stability and a sound social peace. Bill Clinton has expressed 
a subtle understanding of the peculiarities of our situation. 
You see, the Americans have experienced and are experiencing 
quite a lot, too. We can count on complete support for the 
reforms being carried out by the Russian president, the 
Government, and the reformers in the new parliament. 
  I have talked about both the problems in our economy, about 
the positive changes in it, and about the elements of 
stabilization. I stressed that at the present time it is not 
humanitarian aid that we need but full-blooded cooperation, 
taking into account the transitional nature of the young market 
economy of Russia. 
  Specifically I find that, together with the Tokyo package 
and 
with Clinton's package in Vancouver, that the most tangible 
support for Russia would be for the American market to open up 
to our exports, be it raw materials or machines. I am very 
content that today an agreement on uranium has at last been 
signed after two years of talks. 
  Cold war restriction must be removed altogether, 
restrictions 
like the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Artificial barriers imposed 
under the pretext that Russia is dumping should be removed. And 
let's just say that the case with our uranium is more likely 
just fear of competition from more advanced technology and 
cheaper material. 
  Bill Clinton has done much since Vancouver. He has kept his 
word as regards dismantling the economic obstructions of the 
cold war. Discriminatory restrictions have been removed from 
U.S. internal legislation, or most of them. About 5,000 types 
of Russian goods are no longer subject to increased taxes. The 
U.S. President has done much to introduce Russia into 
international financial and economic organizations. I do not 
think it will be long before the G-7 becomes the G-8. 
  Russo-American relations have finally moved into the phase 
of 
mature, strategic, global partnership in all spheres during 
these talks. The partnership has opened the way to general 
understanding, both of the new prospects ahead and of the new 
problems. We are both convinced that the modern world should be 
democratic, open, and integrated. 
As regards equality, mutual benefit, and accounting for each 
others' interests, there is no need to talk about this anymore, 
it goes without saying. This principle vector of our 
partnership is set out in the Moscow declaration which we have 
signed. It reflects and reinforces the historical improvement 
in Russian-American relations in Eurasia and the world as a 
whole. 
  Our mutual activities aimed at strengthening strategic 
stability and security are taking on new substance. Thanks to 
them, in the last few months alone the world and our countries 
have avoided many traps and errors. There is also an evident 
positive result--the strengthening of cooperation in the sphere 
of security and disarmament, peace-keeping, cooperation, and 
economic openness. 
  The ground-breaking step which has finally been taken in 
Moscow is a denouement in documents leading to the elimination 
of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. I consider the document which 
was signed today by the three presidents to be historical. 
Everyone wins from this, first and foremost the Ukrainian 
people themselves. The agreements reached at our trilateral 
summit meeting save resources, get rid of disagreement, and give 
a good example to other countries. They are reinforced by the 
Russian-American statement on strengthening all regimes for the 
non-proliferation of weaponry of mass destruction. And the 
durability of non-proliferation is at present, as is well known, 
being seriously tested. 
  The U.S. President brought us right up to date on the 
'Partnership for Peace' concept adopted in Brussels. The idea 
is seemingly from NATO, but it contains a primordial element of 
Russian-U.S. joint creative work. This concept is an important 
step in the creation of a security system from Vancouver to 
Vladivostok, which rules out the formation of new divisive lines 
or zones of unequal security. 
  We see in this idea one of the options for building a new 
Europe -- one of them, but not the only one, of course. We 
shall put specific content into this channel of cooperation, 
including in the military sphere. And in doing so we shall not, 
of course, forget the other collective security structures in 
Europe, above all the well-tried institutions of the United 
Nations and CSCE. 
  I briefed the President in detail about the integrationary 
processes that have got under way on the territory of the former 
Soviet Union, and in particular about the latest summit meetings 
within the context of the CIS. There need be no fear of any 
neo-imperialist lust here--Russia's only interest is in 
stability. It is undertaking honest mediatory efforts to 
extinguish the hotbeds of conflicts on the perimeters of its new 
borders. We are ready to cooperate widely and even to 
coordinate our actions here with the United Nations, the CSCE, 
and with the entire international community. Unfortunately, the 
international community itself has not as yet shown a great deal 
of enthusiasm. There has been a wary reaction to our specific 
proposals, whether in Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, or in 
Tajikistan. 
  I think that the United States and ourselves will now have a 
greater understanding on this very important question. 
  I firmly raised the question of human rights violations 
among 
national minorities, especially in the Baltic area. There 
should be no double standards here, whether it is taking place 
in Haiti or in the Baltic area. As a result we adopted a 
statement with teeth on ensuring human rights, and the President 
confirmed that he personally would adopt corresponding measures 
on contacts with the Baltic countries, so that discrimination 
against the Russian- speaking population there will ultimately 
be abandoned. 
  I do not want things to sound too upbeat. That does not 
reflect the nature of our frank and businesslike conversations. 
There were, and will be, disagreements. But the main thing is 
the desire to seek understandings, which is later embodied in 
specific policies. Such is the flight assignment for the 
Russian-American partnership. It will be a good replacement for 
the flight assignment for strategic missiles, which will now not 
be aimed at one another. Thank you.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Ukraine cannot resolve 
the problem of manufacturing fuel for atomic power stations from 
highly-enriched uranium contained in nuclear weapons on its own. 
It is also inexpedient to set up such production processes. 
This conclusion was reached by the bureau of the Commission for 
Issues of Nuclear Policy under the president of Ukraine, which 
examined this issue at a meeting chaired by Academician Viktor 
Baryahtar [name as received] of Ukraine's Academy of Sciences. 
  In the opinion of the meeting's participants Ukraine does 
not 
have any possibility for extracting highly-enriched uranium and 
processing it and this is why they support the decision to 
transfer nuclear warheads to Russia in return for fuel for 
nuclear power stations. According to experts' calculations, the 
construction of new production processes for reprocessing 
highly-enriched uranium from nuclear warheads will not 
strategically solve the problem because there is not enough of 
it. Moreover, in general these production processes are 
ecologically dangerous. 
  The commission's bureau has resolved to support the activity 
of the president in up drawing appropriate agreements with 
Russia and the United States that would suit the national 
interests of the state. [signed] The press service of the 
president and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.

  [Text] Indonesia plans to ratify the Convention on the 
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons by the end of 1994. Hassan 
Wirayuda, director for international organizations in the 
Department of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Jakarta 
yesterday that the plan will be brought before the House of 
Representatives. This is because deliberations on the matter -- 
which are very delicate and will have a far-reaching impact -- 
will take a long time. 
  Meanwhile, Ian Kenyon, executive director of the 
Organization 
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, welcomed the Indonesian 
plan. Only four of the 154 countries that signed the convention 
have ratified it. He expressed his hope that more countries 
will ratify the convention. The four countries are Sweden, 
Fiji, Mauritius, and Seychelles.

<F P=106> [Article by Nick Rufford, Far East correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Japan has acquired all the parts necessary for a 
nuclear weapon and may even have built a bomb which requires 
only enriched plutonium for completion, according to a secret 
government report. 
  The Ministry of Defence has warned Downing Street that the 
crisis over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes is 
threatening to force Japan to abandon its non-nuclear stance. 
The risks are detailed in a paper to the Joint Intelligence 
Committee, Whitehall's main security body, which advises the 
cabinet and the prime minister. 
  The report, sent last month, reveals that Japan has key 
bomb-making components, including plutonium and electronic 
triggers, and has the expertise to "go nuclear" very quickly. 
  One expert who has seen the report said: "They (the 
Japanese) 
could have acquired all the expertise for imploding a weapon 
without breaking safeguards. All they would need to do is 
select adequate amounts of plutonium for the core." 
  American intelligence officials said President Bill Clinton 
has given up hope of stopping North Korea getting nuclear 
weapons, a setback which is likely to spark a regional arms 
race. The Pyongyang government still refuses to allow full 
inspections of two disputed nuclear sites. 
  Tension increased last week when America announced it would 
deploy the Patriot antimissile system in South Korea. North 
Korea described the move as an "unpardonable grave military 
challenge." 
  The Patriots are supposed to help reassure South Korea and 
Japan by providing a first-line defence. But they will not 
prevent Japan developing a nuclear deterrent if it fears a 
surprise attack, intelligence sources said. 
  The turning point would come if North Korea improves the 
accuracy and range of its Nodong missile. The weapon, a version 
of the Iraqi Scud, can carry a nuclear or chemical payload; last 
May it landed a test flight in the Sea of Japan. 
  The Whitehall report emphasises there is no evidence yet 
that 
Japan has taken the decision to proceed with a nuclear bomb 
programme, or that it has strayed from its commitments to the 
international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  Japan has its own reprocessing plant for producing plutonium 
and has also contracted Britain and France to supply several 
tonnes of plutonium from Japanese spent reactor fuel. It also 
has sophisticated rockets for launching space satellites that 
could be converted to intermediate or long-range missiles. 
  Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, recently 
confirmed 
that he was "very strongly concerned" by North Korea's growing 
military strength. "The missile North Korea is developing has a 
range of 1,000km and could hit much of Japan eight minutes after 
it is launched," he said. "How to develop a defence against 
that is a matter of great concern to Japan." 
  North Korea is growing increasingly unstable as food 
shortages and electricity blackouts blight the bankrupt nation. 
Kim Il Sung, the 81-year-old dictator, warned in a New Year 
address that any effort to pressure his country into reforms 
"may invite catastrophe." 
  The Central Intelligence Agency last week repeated its 
warning that North Korea probably had enough plutonium for one 
or two nuclear bombs. It also warned of its "heightened state 
of military readiness" and the deployment of rocket launchers 
and artillery close to the demilitarized zone. 
  America has threatened economic sanctions if North Korea 
fails to agree by February 22 to allow inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. North Korea replied it 
would suspend the armistice on the Korean Peninsula if Clinton 
pushed for sanctions.

  [Editorial report] Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 
31 January morning edition received via Nikkei Telecom Database, 
carries a 200-character report noting THE SUNDAY TIMES article 
on Japan's possession of nuclear weapons cited in second ref. 
The text of the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN report, filed by London 
correspondent Yuzo Waki, is as follows: 
  "The 30 January edition of THE SUNDAY TIMES, an influential 
British Sunday paper, frontpages a report saying `Japan is going 
nuclear under the arms expansion race in Asia.' The report 
says: 1) The British Defense Ministry conveyed to the British 
Prime Minister's Office its concern over `Japan being forced to 
abandon its non-nuclear stance'; 2) a document submitted in 
January to the joint Intelligence Committee, the British 
Government's main security body, notes Japan has all the 
equipment and technology necessary for an early deployment of 
nuclear weapons; and 3) an expert who read the document said 
`Japan could have already acquired its own nuclear bombs, and 
all they would need to do is to select adequate amounts of 
plutonium.'"

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan 31 KYODO -- Japan on Monday [31 January] 
denied allegations by a British newspaper report that it may 
abandon its nonnuclear stance and chose to possess nuclear 
weapons. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference 
that Japan maintains its three-point nonnuclear principle of not 
possessing, producing or allowing nuclear weapons into Japan so 
that developing nuclear weapons is "impossible." 
  Saito said the ministry is investigating whether the British 
Ministry of Defense has compiled a report on the possibility of 
Japan's development of nuclear weapons, as was reported by the 
SUNDAY TIMES. 
  The SUNDAY TIMES said the Ministry of Defense has warned 
Prime Minister John Major that North Korea's nuclear program may 
force Japan to abandon its nonnuclear stance. 
  The paper said Japan has acquired all the parts needed to 
make a nuclear weapon and may have built a bomb which requires 
only plutonium to be completed and that the risks were detailed 
in a paper to the Joint Intelligence Committee, the government's 
main security adviser to the cabinet. 
  Saito said the option to possess nuclear weapons would only 
contribute to the instability of the international environment 
surrounding Japan and that it runs counter to Japan's peace and 
prosperity. 
  "So it is totally impossible that Japan will change the 
three-point nonnuclear principle," he said. 
  He added that Japan is a member of the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty and that it also supports the indefinite 
extension of the treaty when it is reviewed in 1995. 
  If such a British Government report exists, Japan will have 
to once again make clear that it is impossible that Japan will 
opt to possess nuclear weapons and seek understanding from 
Britain and the international community, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 1 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
Tuesday [1 February] brushed aside a reported move toward the 
possession of nuclear weapons and renewed a commitment to its 
long-held nonnuclear policy. 
  "Our country has been maintaining three nonnuclear 
principles 
and our use of nuclear energy is limited to peaceful purposes," 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference. 
  "It is impossible for us to develop nuclear weapons," the 
top 
government spokesman said. 
  Japan has long adhered to a policy of not possessing or 
producing nuclear weapons or allowing them into Japan. 
  Takemura's comment was intended to refute reports by a 
British newspaper that Tokyo might alter its nonnuclear policy 
and opt to possess nuclear weapons. 
  The SUNDAY TIMES reported Sunday that Britain's Defense 
Ministry has warned Prime Minister John Major that North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons development program may compel Japan 
to give up its nonnuclear policy. 
  Takemura said the British Government has acknowledged it has 
no reason to doubt Japan's nonnuclear stand. 
  He also denied a report carried Monday by another British 
paper, the independent, that Tokyo plans to develop 
intercontinental ballistic missiles in connection with its 
imminent launching of the first all-Japanese satellite-launch 
rocket. 
  "I want to emphasize our nation's space development 
activities are strictly limited to peaceful purposes," Takemura 
noted.

  [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, Feb 1 (AFP) -- A deadly 
Russian secret "laser" weapon which zaps its victims' brains 
will be tested Wednesday [2 February] in Serb-held northern 
Bosnia, Russian ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
said Tuesday [1 February]. 
  Zhirinovskiy told journalists in the Montenegrin capital 
that 
"my officers (soldiers of the Russian army close to 
Zhirinovskiy's party) will carry out a test of the weapon 
tomorrow in a confined space in Brcko." 
  Speaking after a meeting here with Svetozar Marovic, 
secretary general of the governing ex-communist Socialist 
Democratic Party, Zhirinovskiy said: "Russia has several types 
of secret weapon. Their two-pronged effect is impossible to 
survive." 
  The weapon to be tested Wednesday "acts directly on the 
brain, has the power of a laser and is not radioactive but 
ecological," he added. 
  The announcement echoed claims made by the leader of the 
Liberal Democratic Party in December that Russia possessed a 
secret weapon called the "Elipton" that was more powerful than a 
nuclear bomb and could wipe out the whole of humanity. 
  The claim was dismissed at the end of December by Russian 
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. 
  News of the test raised eyebrows in Belgrade as even if the 
weapon existed, the Russian volunteers known to be fighting in 
the former Yugoslavia are generally young men rather than 
officers or technicians. 
  Zhirinovskiy later told a crowd of several thousand people 
gathered in the centre of Podgorica that "Russians and Serbs 
have two enemies, the Catholic religion in the west and Islam in 
the east." 
  Russia had therefore to "play the major role in liberating 
the Slav peoples who are under threat of being converted to 
Catholicism." 
  Zhirinovskiy, who is on a whirlwind tour of republics of the 
former Yugoslavia, was also due to meet with Montenegrin 
opposition representatives here. 
  He visited Serb-held regions of Croatia and Bosnia Monday 
and 
was expected to return to Trebinje, in the self-declared Bosnian 
Serb republic, later Tuesday. 
  Montenegro and Serbia, which form the present rump 
Yugoslavia, are subject to UN-imposed international sanctions 
for backing Serb forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> ["S. Etr." report: "Serbian Secret Weapon, According to </F>
Zhirinovskiy"] 
  [Text] The "secret weapon" given to the Bosnian Serbs is 
apparently called Elipton and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the Russian 
extreme nationalist leader, on a visit to the former Yugoslavia 
until yesterday, states that it is not a joke: "Russian 
counterespionage officers used it on Wednesday against a Muslim 
military unit, killing 12 enemy soldiers. Their bodies bore no 
trace of firearm injury and the neighboring buildings were not 
damaged." 
  The Elipton apparently kills by some kind of ultrasound. The 
story may seem crazy and some close aides of Zhirinovskiy are 
playing down these remarks. But the latter insists and 
denounces skeptics and "all those who are afraid of the strength 
of his party and the new Russia." A section of the Serb press 
goes further, citing academicians with very grand-sounding 
titles who maintain that the principle behind this revolutionary 
weapon, capable of reversing the balance of forces with the 
West, is based on the work of Eugene Mathieu, a French 
mathematician of the last century.

  [Text] Pristina, 10 Feb (TANJUG) -- Borislav Prelevic, the 
vice president of the Party of Serbian Unity [Stranka Srpskog 
Jedinstva -- SSJ], said in Pristina today he demanded that 
Ibrahim Rugova, the president of the Democratic Alliance of 
Kosovo [Demokratski Savez Kosova -- DSK], be arrested in, as he 
put it, "his capacity as the leader of an enemy terrorist 
organization." 
  At a news conference, Prelevic said that Rugova and his 
aides 
were explicitly working on dismantling the Serbian state in this 
area. He also warned that they [SSJ] themselves would bring 
Rugova to court if official organs failed to arrest him. 
  Borislav Prelevic told the press about a recent meeting 
between Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia, and SSJ President Zeljko Raznjatovic 
Arkan, saying that on an that occasion Arkan had been given a 
secret weapon. This is a solar and laser weapon tested in 
real-life conditions, called "Elipton," Prelevic explained. 
  According to Prelevic, Zhirinovskiy and Arkan signed a 
treaty 
on military cooperation that envisages, among other things, that 
in "the event of foreign aggression against any Serbian land 
dozens of thousands of Kozaks will come to their aid."

  [Text] Kuwait City, Feb 7 (AFP) -- UN disarmament chief 
Rolf Ekeus said here Monday [7 February] he was not convinced 
that Iraq had provided full details about its chemical weapons. 
  "We feel quite satisfied, but not fully satisfied," the head 
of the UN Special Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) told 
reporters, following his four-day mission to Baghdad. 
  "In the chemical area we are not satisfied that Iraq has 
given us full, detailed information necessary for us to be 
definite that all these weapons have been taken away," Ekeus 
said. 
  The Swedish UN official on Sunday ended a visit to Iraq 
saying Baghdad and the United Nations still disagreed over 
certain aspects of the long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons 
programmes, despite their determination to implement the 
surveillance measures quickly. 
  Ekeus said Monday he was confident that all Iraq's 
long-range 
missiles had been destroyed, along with the production 
facilities. 
  "We have the satisfactory feeling that most of the Iraqi 
capabilities have now been destroyed and eliminated," Ekeus 
said, referring to the dismantling of Iraqi weapons programmes 
in line with the 1991 Gulf war ceasefire conditions. 
  In a joint statement issued in Baghdad Sunday, Ekeus and 
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz said both sides 
"expressed their readiness to expedite the process of 
establishing ongoing monitoring and verification in a spirit of 
goodwill." 
  They said their aim was to enable the International Atomic 
Energy Agency to report to the UN Security Council "that, in 
their view, Iraq had taken all the actions called for by 
paragraph 22 of Resolution 687." 
  The clause provides for the lifting of the international oil 
embargo against Iraq once Baghdad has honoured UN resolutions 
calling for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed four 
days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. 
  Ekeus was due to leave Kuwait for New York Monday, Kuwaiti 
officials said.

<F P=106> [By Faruq Choukri] </F>
  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 6 (AFP) -- A senior UN official said 
here Sunday the United Nations and Baghdad still disagreed over 
certain aspects of the long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons 
programmes, despite their pledge to implement the measures 
quickly. 
  Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special Commission on disarming 
Iraq, told reporters after talks with senior Iraqi officials 
that "there are definitely different assessments" concerning the 
surveillance programme. 
  "There are still some question marks, and we have been 
working on them with some, but not complete, success during 
these talks," Ekeus said before leaving for Kuwait. 
  Ekeus, who arrived in Baghdad Wednesday, held talks with 
Deputy Foreign Minister Tariq 'Aziz, Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Sa'id al-Sahhaf and General 'Amir Muhammad Rashid, head of the 
military industrialization organization. 
  In a joint statement, Ekeus and Aziz said both sides 
"expressed their readiness to expedite the process of 
establishing ongoing monitoring and verification in a spirit of 
goodwill." 
  They said their aim was to enable the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) to report to the UN Security Council "that, 
in their view, Iraq had taken all the actions called for by 
paragraph 22 of Resolution 687." 
  The clause provides for the lifting of the international oil 
embargo against Iraq once Baghdad has honoured UN resolutions 
calling for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  Ekeus said he tried to emphasise in his talks with Iraqi 
leaders the "political ambiance" surrounding the clause. 
  He was referring to the position of certain UN Security 
Council members, notably the United States, which oppose any 
lifting of the oil embargo until Baghdad recognises the 
sovereignty of Kuwait and improves its policy toward the Moslem 
Shiite and Kurdish minorities in Iraq. 
  Iraqi Foreign Ministry Under-Secretary Riyad al-Qaysi, who 
spoke at a news conference with Ekeus Sunday, said Iraq had 
"implemented all that is required" under the clause. 
  However, last week U.S. President Bill Clinton said Iraq 
still had a long way to go toward compliance with the Gulf war 
ceasefire conditions, despite Baghdad's acceptance of UN 
Security Council Resolution 715 in November, which called for 
long-term weapons monitoring. 
  The joint statement issued by Ekeus and 'Aziz said the 
"intense phase" of UN inspections would continue, and Iraq had 
"indicated that it would welcome all such inspection teams and 
facilitate their tasks." 
  The two sides discussed technical matters in a "professional 
and business-like manner," the statement said, and their talks 
"yielded positive results." 
  They agreed to hold a further round of talks in the first 
half of March to maintain the momentum in the disarmament 
process. 
  In the hope of obtaining an end to the embargo, Baghdad is 
cooperating with efforts to dismantle programmes for nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons, which are banned under the UN 
resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf war. 
  UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed four 
days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. 
  On Friday, IAEA officials said they would remove the last 
batch of Iraq's irradiated fuel next week and start setting up 
cameras at former nuclear sites. 
  The joint statement said Iraq and the United Nations had 
"built on the significant progress" made since last July, when 
the two sides discussed the possibility of lifting the oil 
embargo. 
  Iraq meanwhile reiterated its rejection of a plan to sell 
some of its oil under UN control. 
  Under UN Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712, Iraq is 
allowed to sell up to 1.6 billion dollars' worth of oil for six 
months under international supervision. The proceeds must be 
used to buy food and medical supplies, fund UN activities in 
Iraq, and pay war damages.

  [Text] Manama, Jan 30 (AFP) -- The head of a 16-member UN 
arms inspection team said here Sunday his just-ended mission to 
Iraq was a success, adding that Iraqi officials had promised to 
cooperate in setting up a monitoring system. 
  "We achieved all objectives," said Russian team leader 
Nikita 
Smidovitch, who told reporters his 10-day mission to Iraq had 
been "successful." 
  Smidovitch was inspecting Iraq's military arsenal under UN 
Security Council Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. 
  "The Iraqis had a forthcoming attitude," Smidovitch said. 
"Iraq has promised to cooperate and said they will do what they 
can to shorten the period" needed to set the monitoring process 
in motion. 
  He was to leave Manama, the United Nations' base for Iraqi 
missions, late Sunday. 
  The long-term monitoring of the Iraqi arms program is 
critcial to Baghdad's hopes for an end to the embargo imposed 
after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. By accepting 
Security Council Resolution 715, Iraq hopes to at least have UN 
sanctions on its oil exports lifted. 
  Asked how many missions were still needed before long-term 
monitoring could begin, Smidovitch replied? "Quite frankly, it 
will take time. We need more activities to set up the 
monitoring process." 
  The surveillance program is the next UN step following the 
destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf 
war of January-February 1991. 
  Iraq agreed to the surveillance in November after rejecting 
it for three years and has been lobbying hard for an end to the 
embargo. 
  On Wednesday, the UN's deputy disarmament chief said 
long-term monitoring of Baghdad's weapons program was still some 
way off despite Iraq's efforts to have sanctions lifted. 
  American Charles Duelfer, deputy head of the UN Special 
Commission (UNSCOM) disarming Iraq under the Gulf war ceasefire 
resolutions, spent five days in Iraq preparing a visit there 
this week by his boss Rolf Ekeus. 
  Ekeus is due to arrive in Baghdad on Tuesday to discuss 
monitoring, but has said he is unlikely to recommend a lifting 
of sanctions before the end of the year.

"As of February, Ukraine Will Begin To Remove 490 Warheads to 
Its Own Bases. The Russian Army Is Preparing To Evacuate 
Missile Troop Officers"] 
  [Text] The joint Russian-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement of 14 
January on the terms for the abolition of the "Ukrainian" 
nuclear weapons, signed in Moscow by the three presidents, has 
apparently proved not more long-lasting than previous such 
accords. A week after the ink had dried on the Moscow 
declaration, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry began, without any 
coordination with Moscow, an operation of actually seizing the 
strategic nuclear weapons. 
  On 21 January Army General Lieutenant Vladimir Mikhtyuk, 
commander of the 43d Missile Army, and also the commanders of 
the 46th (Pervomayskaya) and 19th (Khmelnitskaya) missile 
divisions were summoned to Kiev to a session of the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry Collegium "on matters of military discipline 
and training." The army commander reported this to Moscow, to 
the Main Command of the Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF), because 
under an order that has been in effect for 33 years, the SRF 
army or division commander may not leave his unit without 
permission from the SRF commander in chief. In Kiev, however, 
the generals were suddenly ordered to swear the Ukrainian oath 
of allegiance. Gen. Mikhtyuk and Nikolay Filatov, commander of 
the 46th Division, under what one of the participants in the 
conference described as tough pressure, swore the Ukrainian 
oath. Rustam Karimov, commander of the 19th division, refused. 
  After that the 43d Missile Army was actually placed outside 
the SRF Main Command's operational control. General Karimov has 
been removed from the post of division commander and is to fly 
to Moscow within the next few days. Today or tomorrow a new, 
"Ukrainian" commander will arrive at the 19th Missile Division 
who will be appointed by the Ukrainian defense minister without 
any coordination with Moscow. The SRF Command stated that they 
do not even know the new commander's name. Prior to that, 
during the last two years, all cadre reshuffles in the missile 
troops in Ukraine were made only by a joint order after they 
were coordinated in Moscow and Kiev. 
  On 22 January the Ukrainian defense minister signed Order 
001 
(classified as top secret) whereby the troops of the 43d Army 
must be prepared as of 1 February to begin removing the nuclear 
ammunition from the depots of the 19th and 46th divisions (all 
in all, 490 units) to "S" installations, from where Russian 
specialists were withdrawn last year and where the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry has deployed its own nuclear units, manned 
partly by officers of the 12th Main Directorate of the Russian 
Defense Ministry who stayed in Ukraine and partly by reserve 
officers. Colonel General Igor Smirnov, SRF commander in chief, 
sent a coded telegram to the Ukrainian defense minister 
expressing in a polite form his professional concern over the 
situation, but has not received any answer yet. 
  The SRF Main Command is currently making preparations for an 
urgent evacuation to Russia of all missile officers who refuse 
to swear the Ukrainian oath. According to SRF Main Command 
estimates, between 40 and 50 percent of the officers will leave. 
The divisions will become combat-incapable, the combat duty 
system will be disrupted, and political confrontation in missile 
unit crews between "pro-Ukrainian" and "pro-Russian" officers is 
possible. 
  Up until now Russia has been rendering the 43d Army 
technical 
assistance in maintaining its entire extremely complex strategic 
missile systems while officers have been undergoing regular 
retraining within the SRF framework. Now supplies and technical 
assistance for the army have been stopped. The Russian military 
is no longer in control of the situation. It believes that it 
has done everything possible within its jurisdiction and that 
now the problem of the Ukrainian nuclear weapons will again have 
to be decided by politicians in Moscow, Kiev, and Washington.

  [Text] A senior Russian Defence Ministry official believes 
that the Ukrainian military department's latest steps can wreck 
the Russo-American-Ukrainian agreements signed in Moscow on 
January 14. The accords aim at scrapping the nuclear weapons 
deployed in Ukraine. 
  A Russian military spokesman has told Interfax that 
Ukraine's 
Defence Ministry has warned the strategic missile forces 
personnel that the officers refusing to swear allegiance to 
Ukraine will be dismissed. 
  The spokesman described these Ukrainian actions as the start 
of a seizure of strategic nuclear weapons. He stressed that in 
these conditions the Russian military could not bear 
responsibility for the nuclear ammunition's control and service. 
He did not rule out that pressed by Kiev, quite a few missile 
forces officers would have to leave Ukraine with "unpredictable 
consequences." 
  He is convinced that the fate of the nuclear weapons in 
Ukraine must concern primarily Kiev and western countries. "The 
loss of proper control over nuclear weapons may be disastrous," 
he stressed.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, 4 Feb -- The Russian Foreign Ministry 
welcomes the steps taken by the Ukrainian parliament, which 
ratified two of six points in the START I treaty. An official 
from the Russian Foreign Ministry stated this in a conversation 
with an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. In his opinion, this was 
made possible by an accord reached during the January trilateral 
summit between delegations from Russia, the United States, and 
Ukraine in Moscow. A mechanism for implementing Ukraine's 
decision on the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its 
territory was drawn up at the meeting. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The works to destroy chemical weapons on the test 
site in Shikhany, Saratov region, seriously damage the health of 
people who live there, according to the former senior research 
official of the Volsk Scientific and Research Institute of 
Organic Chemistry, Vladimir Uglyov. 
  The town of Volsk is situated a few dozen kilometers away 
from Shikhany, which hosts a test site of the Defense Ministry. 
At the moment, the Moscow city court is conducting closed 
hearings of the case of another former employee of the same 
institute, Vil Mirzayanov, accused of revealing confidential 
information on the production of chemical weapons in Russia. 
  Uglyov said the weapons were destroyed in Shikhany by 
burying 
in the ground. Substances containing arsenic, in particular 
lewisite, were simply dumped into pits dug especially for this 
purpose. Such substances are supposed to lose their poisonous 
features in a short period of time. 
  "However, the background level of arsenic in the region 
exceeds the maximum limit three times," Uglyov said. From 
August 1992 to August 1993, the number of illnesses went up by 
1.8 times in the region, he said. Uglyov pointed out that the 
test site was situated not far from the river Volga and did not 
rule out the possibility of the poisonous substances' leakages 
into the water. 
  The scientist said he had never received a response to his 
repeated appeals to the president and government to take 
measures to improve the ecological situation in the region. He 
pointed out that he had worked on the development of chemical 
weapons for 15 years. 
  "If the detrimental consequences of the destruction of 
chemical weapons remain ignored, I will make public the 
poisonous substances' formulas and names, sources of raw 
materials, techniques of their manufacturing and combat use," 
Uglyov said. He said he was doing that only to draw everyone's 
attention to the health of people residing in the Saratov region.

<F P=106> [From the "Itogi" program -- passages within slantlines </F>
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev] Since the latest 
attempt to reform the security bodies is again in the public 
eye, the case of the chemical scientist Vil Mirzayanov is very 
relevant. He was accused by the investigating bodies of the 
former Russian Security Ministry of disclosing state secrets 
regarding production of chemical weapons. Although the 
president issued a decree in December closing the Security 
Ministry and creating the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, 
what used to be the Security Ministry investigation arm does not 
form part of the new security authorities but falls within the 
procuracy's jurisdiction. Many people see the fact that the 
Mirzayanov case has been brought back to life just when the 
process of reforming the former Interior Ministry [as heard] is 
under way is no mere coincidence, and many even doubt the 
sincerity of the authorities' stated intention to truly remove 
the Security Ministry as a political secret police. Reporting 
on all this and on the past week's new twists in the Mirzoyanov 
case is Vladimir Lenskiy. 
  Lenskiy: The Mirzayanov case has been in train 
since last October when the scientist published an article 
called "The Poisoning of Politics" in MOSCOW NEWS. In the 
article he said that despite Gorbachev and Yeltsin's 
declarations, Russia is continuing to create chemical weapons. 
More than that, a toxic substance called Novichok-5, a binary 
weapon component, has been synthesized. Mirzayanov was charged 
with disclosing state secrets and his trial began on 6 January 
1994, even though many lawyers and human-rights activists 
consider that he has no case to answer. [passage omitted -- 
background, international organizations defend Miraoyanov, 
Mirzayanov arrested and incarcerated] 
  Mirzayanov's lawyer (Aleksandr Asnis) thought it necessary 
to 
meet with Russian Procurator General Kazannik, but not only this 
meeting ought to have an impact on the secrets trial. 
  A colleage of Mirzayanov, (Vladimir Uglev), yesterday 
managed 
to obtain a meeting with Yuriy Baturin, the president's national 
security adviser. (Vladimir Uglev's) fight to see someone from 
the presidential entourage nearly led to a real disclosure of 
state secrets. 
  Uglev: On the afternoon of the fourth [month not 
specified], I will turn over to the Russian and foreign mass 
media data on a new type of Soviet chemical weapon, of which I 
am one of the developers. I want to talk about its chemical 
formulae, its chemical ingredients, some ways of obtaining it, 
its military application, and the raw materials from which it is 
made. 
  Lenskiy: The gamble paid off. Uglev was not only 
given a whole hour of the Kremlin's time, but Yuriy Baturin even 
assured him that the Mirzayanov case would soon be resolved. 
The scientist used his meeting with the national security 
adviser to draw the authorities' attention to certain aspects of 
the destruction of chemical weapons in Russia. 
  Uglev: According to our figures and calculations, 
there are far more chemical weapons in this country than the 
declared 40,000 tonnes. At present, the military persons 
responsible, the highest-ranking officials, the Defense 
Ministry's chemical weapons forces directorate, which at some 
point provided that figure, are now apparently trying to fit the 
country's security into it [podognat pod etu tsifru]. 
  Lenskiy: According to Uglev, explosions at the 
Shikhany range are slowing killing everything that lives nearby. 
  Uglev: In Volskiy Rayon, Voskresenskiy Rayon, and 
those that surround the range there has been an outbreak of skin 
diseases. A military institute, under instructions from the 
town authorities, carried out an investigation, but it tried to 
make its investigation prove that cow parsnip was to blame, 
which does not grow at all in Volskiy Rayon. And details that 
objectively, so to speak -- the clinical features of these skin 
diseases as shown by a skin clinic -- have an extraordinary 
external similarity to those of mustard gas [iprit ilyuzit] are 
virtually sweeping the town. That is, there is a large number 
of sick children. Worse, it is growing stronger every year, it 
is very serious. That is, there is obviously a sufficient 
concentration of these substances in the environment so that any 
more could lead to really tragic consequences./ 
  Lenskiy: In the opinion of Mirzayanov, Uglev, and 
their colleagues all this means that Russia is not ready for 
chemical disarmament, neither technologically nor economically. 
The cost of the American program to destroy chemical weapons 
has already reached tens of billions of dollars. The Russian 
program, Vladimir Uglev thinks, will cost even more. 
  Kiselev: By way of conclusion, let me add that I 
was speaking to a highly-placed member of the presidential 
staff, who requested anonymity, today. He confirmed the 
information in the report that you have just seen, namely that 
the absurd and ambivalent situation of the Russian authorities 
over the Mirzayanov case could be resolved some time this week.

"`Mirzayanov Case' To Be Dismissed"] 
  [Text] The trial of chemist Vil Mirzayanov will likely be 
dismissed in the coming days. According to some information, 
Yuriy Baturin, the Russian president's national security 
adviser, has reported in detail to Boris Yeltsin the 
circumstances of the criminal case against the scientist who had 
allegedly revealed a state secret about the development in 
Russia of new types of chemical weapons, and the president 
"adequately reacted to the prosecution's being 
unconstitutional." Yuriy Baturin explained that a criminal case 
under Article 6 of the Criminal Procedure Code may be dismissed 
in connection with changed circumstances. He regards as such 
"changed circumstances" the adoption of the new Russian 
Federation Constitution under which "everyone has the right to 
freely look for, receive, pass on, produce, and distribute 
information by any legal means. The list of information 
constituting a state secret is determined by a federal law." 
Since no open list of information about state secrets has been 
published, this circumstance may be cause for dismissing the 
case against the scientist, something Russian human rights 
activists and the liberal press insist on.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Uglev, associate at the State </F>
Institute for Organic Synthesis Technologies, by Andrey 
Zhdankin, place and date not given: "Everyone Will Know the 
Formula for Binary Death"] 
  [Text] Last week the press was following development 
of the affair involving Vil Mirzayanov, a doctor of chemical 
sciences accused of divulging state secrets. Together with Lvov 
Fedorov, Mirzayanov informed the world that in violation of 
every agreement, our country was until recently producing the 
newest types of chemical weapons. The situation exploded when 
his colleague Vladimir Uglev, an associate at the State 
Institute for Organic Synthesis Technologies--the leading 
institute in the sphere of chemical weapons development, stated 
in an open letter that unless he was given an audience with the 
president so that he could convey his point of view on 
"implementation of the Convention on the Banning of Chemical 
Weapons and problems regarding chemical weapons destruction," he 
would be compelled on 4 February to reveal the formulas of these 
weapons to the press. 
  The ultimatum did not have a chance to expire since by 
hook or by crook, V. Uglev succeeded in securing a meeting with 
Yuriy Baturin, presidential adviser on security matters. Our 
correspondent met with Vladimir Uglev immediately following this 
meeting. 
  Zhdankin: What is your relationship to chemical 
weapons? 
  Uglev: I have been involved in their development 
over the course of 15 years. I wound up in a group generating 
the newest developments, and headed this group. Substance A-232, 
based upon which our country's latest binary device was 
manufactured (code name "Novice"--Ed.), came out of my flask. I 
have gone through all the stages--from synthesis to military 
testing of chemical weapons. 
  Zhdankin: What is the essence of our problems 
related to chemical weapons destruction? 
  Uglev: The main problem is the fact that a 
realistic assessment must be made of the extent of their 
stockpiles, because in actuality they significantly exceed the 
declared amount of 40,000 tonnes. "Excess" stores are being 
hurriedly destroyed right now using barbaric methods at various 
testing facilities, including the Shikhany Testing Grounds. 
Specialists who are working there confirm this. In addition, I 
observed such detonations myself. The unit commander (of the 
testing grounds--Ed.), General Danilkin, asserts that 
conventional, nonchemical charges are being detonated. This does 
not conform to reality. There is a certain cloud that forms 
following the detonation of chemical ammunition--I saw this 
myself. In addition, there is the testimony of officers who 
attest that over the course of recent years toxic substances 
have systematically been simply poured out onto the ground, or 
mixed with fuel and burned. These methods present a horrible 
danger to all life in the district, primarily to people. 
  Zhdankin: Why did you select such an inflexible 
form of conversation with the leadership of the country? 
  Uglev: This was an act of desperation. I had no 
other means available to attract the attention of the 
authorities. The judicial persecution of Vil Mirzayanov 
continues. I believe these proceedings are unjust--they trample 
upon the Constitution and human rights. 
  Zhdankin: You have just met with Yuriy Baturin in 
the Kremlin. Did you reach any understanding? 
  Uglev: I am satisfied with the meeting, but I do 
not know how things will go from here. I hope Vil Sultanovich 
will be released in the near future. At my meeting with Yuriy 
Mikhaylovich we reached an understanding that the problem of 
chemical weapons is exceedingly serious and that resolving it 
will require methods other than those being proposed by the 
Convention Committee and directorate headed by the chief of 
Chemical Troops. The problem hinges primarily on social 
questions. I am referring to the mood of the population in those 
regions where destruction is planned. The populace will not 
allow plants to be built. The Chapayevsk experience shows this. 
  Zhdankin: Can it be that chemical weapons are now 
simply unnecessary trash? 
  Uglev: Chemical weapons have a short shelf life. 
They can be used when combat operations are actually underway or 
preparations for them are being made. But time is required to 
accumulate them [as published]. After five or 10 years they turn 
into dust subject to destruction. They become simply a poison, 
dangerous only to whoever possesses them. 
  Zhdankin: You have manufactured this poison with 
your own hands for 15 years, and now you are complicating things 
in your life and the lives of those near and dear to you? 
  Uglev: As one of the developers, I consider it a 
crime to remain silent any longer. I see those circles that used 
to fight in support of chemical weapons--and today they have 
become the ones fighting just as energetically for their swift 
destruction. Obtaining tremendous amounts of money for weapons 
destruction, they are spending it quite unwisely, like always, 
and causing the greatest detriment to the ecology. These are 
extremely dishonorable people accustomed to telling lies under 
any regime. And they are lying now. They have just one 
desire--to stay afloat at any price.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginie Coulloudon in Moscow: "Russia: </F>
Chemical Threat: The Terrible Secret"] 
  [Text] Is the Russian chemical bomb a state secret or is it 
an open secret? In Moscow, professor Vil Mirzayanov is paying 
with his freedom his attempt to break the sacrosanct laws of 
secrecy and reveal to the general public what the experts have 
known for a long time. This is a curious fate for this Doctor 
Strangelove-type character, yesterday an honored scientist and 
today sharing his cell with common murderers! 
  The scandal came from where it was least expected. For 
decades, a handful of scientists have been working to develop 
the most lethal neuroparalysis gases that boast an effectiveness 
greater than that achieved by American experts. Guardians of 
the destructive formulae, they are now however threatening to 
reveal all in response to a sudden philanthropic impulse and the 
feeling that they have been conned and exploited by their 
superiors. The first revelation is that Russia has many more 
toxic substances than it officially admits to. At the Paris 
convention on chemical weapons signed last year, the Kremlin 
undertook to release the figures for its arsenal. It admitted to 
storing 40,000 tonnes of various substances, 32,000 tonnes of 
which were neuroparalytic. Vladimir Uglev, one of the three 
protesting scientists and one of the fathers of the binary bomb, 
states, however, that Moscow has already produced 80,000 tonnes 
of mustard gas alone -- the gas used for the first time at Ypres 
in Belgium and which was the terror of the infantrymen gassed by 
the Germans. 
  For these dissidents of military chemistry, the proof that 
Russia lied about the amount of chemical weapons it has is to be 
found at Chikhaniy, in the Saratov region not far from the 
Volga. Away from prying eyes, a constant stream of explosions 
releases thick clouds of toxic substances into the atmosphere. 
It is here that the army destroys its excess of chemical 
weapons before Western observers can notice the deception. All 
this occurs to the detriment of the most basic safety rules. 
  It is claimed that whole vats of toxic substances are buried 
or burned without any safety measures taken whatsoever. No 
surprise then, that it is at Chikhaniy that the highest number 
of ophthalmic lesions and eye cancers are recorded -- twice as 
many as in the rest of the country. 
  State secrecy means that medical information for the regions 
concerned also remains a closely guarded secret. However, we do 
know that a number of soldiers who took part in the destruction 
of mustard gas at the Kambark base in the sixties have since 
died of cancer. Near the Novocheboksariy region of central 
Russia, almost 90 percent of the population suffers from various 
types of pathological illness. In 1993, the 12,000 children of 
Chikhaniy developed twice as many respiratory illnesses as in 
the previous year while the number of complications 
quadrupled.... 
  In the east, the largest threat posed by the military 
chemical industry does not, however, lie simply in this 
half-truth. Russia has two powerful binary weapons capable of 
wiping out entire populations when their internal membrane 
splits to mix two individually inoffensive gases. The first of 
these weapons, named VX, is produced using chemical substances 
that are banned by the Paris convention and which should soon be 
destroyed. The second weapon, on the other hand, is the most 
fearful arm ever dreamed up in this domain -- fearful because it 
is untouchable. 
  According to Vladimir Uglev, the developer of the gas 
code-named A-232, the weapon's originality lies in the 
simplicity of its components which are used in civilian industry 
and which cannot therefore be regulated by international 
experts. "We know that the chemical parameters of such a weapon 
cannot escape the clutches of the generals or terrorists for 
long," Vladimir Uglev accepts. "The question is whether to make 
its composition public knowledge and so demand strict 
international control, or else wait for a `leak' to occur, 
despite our vigilance." 
  By concealing the results obtained during the A-232 research 
and accusing the developers of these weapons of "violating state 
secrecy," the Kremlin seems to have opted for the latter 
solution.

  [Text] The United States will provide nearly $30 million 
to set up a research center in Russia which would devise the 
most effective methods of monitoring the destruction of chemical 
weapons. 
  Accord on this subject was finally reached during U.S. 
President Clinton's recent visit to Moscow and was formalized by 
a protocol which is confidential at the moment. According to 
informed sources, the center will be based at Moscow's 
Vernadskiy Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry. 
Over one-half of the sum promised by the Americans will go on 
instruments and equipment.

  [Text] Lexington, Massachusetts February 3 (NEWSWIRE-TASS) 
-- The U.S. Raytheon engineers and constructors has announced 
that, as a participant in the German-American consortium 
established to build enterprises in Russia for the elimination 
of chemical weapons, it is taking part in working out a 
conceptual framework for designing and building one such 
enterprise near Saratov. 
  Raytheon engineers and constructors is a member of the U.S.- 
German consortium controlled by Lurgi environmental 
Participating Organisation Ltd (Lub/Lurgi Umweltbeteiligungs 
Geselschaft), which was awarded a contract by the Russian 
government to build a plant for the elimination of chemical 
weapons. 
  Other members of the consortium are German firms Uhde GMBH, 
a 
branch of Hoechst AG, Entsorgungs und Sanierungstechnik (EST), 
and a subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace. 
  As one of 130 consignees of the Paris convention banning 
chemical weapons, Russia, which joined it in January 1993, is 
obliged to eliminate all its materials designed for conducting 
chemical warfare before the year 2005. Russia has officially 
admitted that it has 40,000 tonnes of such materials. 
  The consortium brings together the world's two companies 
which have experience of operating chemical weapon elimination 
installations. Raytheon engineers and constructors installed 
and networked equipment for the single operating plant for the 
elimination of chemical weapons of the U.S. Army. It is located 
in the Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The plant, operated 
by the same company, can destroy up to 1,000 tonnes of chemical 
agents annually. 
  Lurgi has been running and maintaining a similar plant for 
the German government in Lower Saxony since it was established 
in 1982. 
  The German Foreign Ministry in October 1993 allocated 3.2 
million DM (about two million U.S. dollars) to finance the phase 
of the development of the conceptual framework for the 
Lub/Saratov project. The working out of the conceptual framework 
is scheduled to be completed in March 1994. 
  Raytheon engineers and constructors is one of the major 
machine-building and construction companies in the world. This 
is one of the four spheres in which Raytheon (Nyse code rtn) is 
doing business. It specialises in various technologies, 
including production of electronic, aircraft and basic electric 
equipment. The company's capital totals nine billion U.S. 
dollars. 
  For more information please contact Raytheon agent Ed Powers 
at (617) 860-2415.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Umnov: "The Bomb for the Poor"; first </F>
two paragraphs are introductory paragraphs] 
  [Text] In 1973 Soviet scientists sharply intensified their 
work on bacteriological weapons which Western politicians have 
called "the atom bomb for poor states." 
  To this day Western experts fear that Russia may have 
preserved its biological-weapons potential. 
  Such apprehensions are voiced despite the fact that Boris 
Yeltsin more than a year and a half ago issued a decree banning 
such work. In addition, several visits to our biological 
facilities by foreign experts, did not uncover anything 
resembling a Soviet bacteriological programme. 
  What is more, mistrust is infectious, and today we begin to 
suspect, along with the Americans, that the "bomb for the poor" 
may surface in Saddam Hussein's Iraq or in China. 
  It is indeed impossible to answer these questions once and 
for all. 
<H5>  100 Tons of Potassium Cyanide in a Bottle </H5>
  The production of a biological bomb does not require 
expensive equipment. It is enough to have a small laboratory, 
such as any medical college has, and hermetically sealed boxes 
in order to build up within a short time a "biomass" necessary 
for several shells. 
  In view of their destructive power poor states should lose 
all interest in superexpensive nuclear weapons. The Soviet 
Union, for instance, had to dismantle and remove from combat 
duty between two and three thousand warheads whose guaranteed 
service life ended and to manufacture as many new ones. Add to 
this the cost of personnel and maintenance work... Isn't it 
cheaper to withdraw from the "nuclear club" and receive a round 
sum for disarmament from the United States? 
  This sum would be hardly enough to buy and conceal in a 
closed town a costly nuclear physicist familiar with atomic 
technology, but its small fraction would be sufficient to find a 
specialist versed in the technology of building up a "biological 
product" and assembling and filling biological munitions. I know 
several cases where scientists, who had taken part in the "5th 
problem," as it was called, came to American laboratories and 
began to work there without a single unclassified publication to 
their credit. The situation now is such that many military 
biologists go in search of work. 
  The "bomb for the poor," a jar with the plague hidden in a 
refrigerator, or another "asymmetric version" inspires no less 
confidence than a nuclear arsenal costing billions and therefore 
calls into question the expediency of preserving on Earth 
weapons of mass destruction as a deterrence factor. 
  MN File: "...A couple of glasses with 
bacteria are comparable in destructive force to 5 tons of a 
nerve gas or 100 tons of potassium cyanide. They do not require 
for storage spacious warehouses that can be detected with the 
help of satellites." Pravda, April 11, 
1989 
<H5>  Biological Weapons as a Primemover of Progress </H5>
  Our century has produced the idea that scientific and 
technological progress is mainly advanced by military research. 
One can already hear it said in Russia that trade in arms can 
become the country's second money earner after raw materials. 
For some reason, however, no one has calculated the cost of a 
single bacteriological programme. 
  In view of the USSR's lag in the sphere of molecular 
biology, 
genetics, and gene engineering, the CPSU Central Committee and 
the Council of Ministers passed a decision in 1973 on the 
accelerated development of these branches of biology and the 
application of their achievements in the national economy. Such 
is the official version which, as it often happens, is only a 
half-truth. 
  It is a fact that the 1948 session of the Lenin All-Union 
Academy of Agricultural Sciences wreaked such havoc on Soviet 
genetics, that many biologists could not recover from the shock 
until recently. By the beginning of the 70s Western scientists 
began gene-engineering work with DNA and were able actively to 
influence the genome and obtained changed forms of bacteria and 
viruses, while Soviet microbiologists continued to work in the 
same old way. 
  It was at that time that a group of well-known scientists 
("civilian" scholars of world renown, some of whom are still 
working) appealed to Brezhnev pointing out that progress in the 
military sphere was impossible without the use of biological 
achievements. As a result the General Secretary personally 
adopted the necessary decision but almost simultaneously signed 
a convention banning such work. 
  Bacteriological weapons are thus probably the only type of 
new arms whose development was conducted at the initiative of 
civilian scientists, which is, in my view, most deplorable. 
These people must have understood that biology was doomed 
without employing the funds and facilities of the 
military-industrial complex. Private interests were also 
involved: many biologists became academicians, state prize 
winners, heroes of socialist labour and were given honoured 
places in the Academy of Sciences. 
  As a result the Soviet Union could have begun within a few 
months large-scale production of bacteriological weapons (which 
was never started, therefore there were no stocks of them and 
there was consequently no problem of destruction, as different 
from nuclear and chemical weapons). But the main thing is that 
the money that was officially invested in biology was aimlessly 
wasted. 
  MN File: In 1946 work on the bacteriological 
bomb began within the system of the USSR Ministry of 
Defence. 
  In 1972 the USSR signed the convention banning 
biological weapons. 
  In 1973 the USSR Council of Ministers placed the 
development of biological weapons under the civilian "cover" of 
the Main Department of Microbiological Industry. 
  In 1975 the convention entered into force. 
  In 1982-83 studies of dangerous pathogens began in 
Koltsovo, Obolensk, Chekhov and Leningrad. 
  In April 1992 this work was prohibited on Russian 
territory by a presidential decree. 
<H5>  A Bomb for `Peaceful Purposes' </H5>
  After Yeltsin's decree the military bacteriological 
programme 
had to be converted. Although a year and a half is hardly 
enough, let us try to sum up some results. 
  The successes of some basic research (which was certainly 
conducted even within the military programme) will probably 
finally be used for peaceful purposes. As for applied research, 
most of it will have to be forgotten because of its destructive 
purpose. 
  During the 20 years of its existence the system ate up money 
that could be better invested in biology, pharmaceuticals and 
medicine and did not produce anything principally new. Meanwhile 
whole institutes of the Pushchino biological centre of the 
Academy of Sciences are being closed for lack of funds. The 
country's pharmaceutical industry is going to pieces. What is 
more, ties between biologists have been broken, and virologists 
and geneticians of the Biopreparat Association often have no 
idea of what their colleagues from the Ministry of Defence work 
on. Military biologists have been left without money and hopes 
for the future. 
  It may be recalled that, while physics is known to have 
prevailed in the 20th century, most experts call biology the 
science of the 21st century. But Russian biology can hardly be 
expected to live that long.

<F P=106> [Unattributed reply to reader's letter under the "Briefing </F>
for the Readers" rubric: "The 1,641th Underground Hiroshima"] 
  [Text] Will China's recent underground nuclear explosion 
not encourage Russia and the United States to carry out new 
nuclear tests? 
  [Signed] S. Boychenko, Lipetsk 
  The underground test in the PRC of a nuclear explosive 
device 
with a yield of 80-90 kilotonnes carried out 5 October last year 
has indeed complicated the situation. So far the leading 
nuclear powers have abided by their voluntary unilateral 
commitments to refrain from such actions ideally until the 
signing in 1996 of an agreement on a complete ban on underground 
nuclear explosions. Tests in the atmosphere, in space, and under 
water were banned earlier by the international treaty of 1963. 
  However, the members of the "nuclear club" decided not to 
follow China's example and will continue to observe the 
moratorium on underground explosions although both Russia and 
the United States proclaimed a little over four months ago their 
readiness not to hold such tests only so long as the other great 
powers refrained from them. So far only the leadership of 
France has expressed the theoretical possibility of staging a 
series of tests in the period up to 1996. 
  As of now the nuclear powers have officially given notice of 
2,166 nuclear test explosions (954 by the United States, 936 by 
the USSR, 192 by France, 44 by Britain, 39 by China, and one by 
India). Of that number the 1,641th nuclear device has now been 
detonated underground at the test sites shown on the attached 
map. [Note: A map accompanies the article showing test sites at 
Nevada, Mururoa, Novaya Zemlya, Semipalatinsk, Lopnor, and the 
Tar desert] 
  As far as is known, neither Russia nor Britain intends to 
detonate even those test charges that they have stored in 
underground galleries: In Russia's case at the test site in 
Semipalatinsk, in Britain's at the U.S. site in Nevada. So let 
us hope that 1994 becomes nuclear-free at least on the territory 
of the main nuclear countries.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>
  [Text] Geneva February 2 TASS -- Now it is important to 
give a good and energetic start to the U.N. disarmament 
conference, which is encountering new difficult problems, above 
all, the task of working out an international treaty on a 
universal ban on nuclear tests, Russia's permanent 
representative in the conference Grigoriy Berdennikov said in an 
interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. 
  Berdennikov noted Russia's principle readiness to go in for 
concluding at present such a treaty, which can be subjected to 
checking, and emphasised that Russia will construct its stand at 
the talks in such a way that they are mainly completed, possibly 
by the spring of 1995. 
  The Russian delegation attaches top priority to the nuclear 
test ban talks in 1994, Berdennikov said. According to him, the 
question of the scope of the treaty should be decided on the 
basis of already existing international accords, above all, the 
Moscow treaty of 1963, which bans nuclear tests in three 
mediums, of course, with the inclusion of a ban on underground 
tests. Russia advocates an unlimited and non-discriminatory 
character of the treaty and equal rights and responsibilities of 
all its participants, he said. 
  The agreement should apply not only to nuclear states, but 
also to those which are capable of making nuclear weapons. The 
treaty should come into force after the submission of 
ratification deeds, provided they include deeds of all states, 
which possess nuclear power plants and research reactors at the 
time of signing the document. There is a need to impose the 
strictest sanctions on participating countries which violate its 
main statutes, right up to imposing economic or other measures 
of compulsions stipulated by the UN Charter. 
  The delegation also favours working out a multilateral 
agreement on guarantees of the security of non-nuclear states.

<F P=106> [Interview with S.N. Voronin, Chief Designer of Nuclear </F>
Charges and Munitions of the Russian Federal Nuclear Center, by 
Aleksandr Nezhnyy, date and place not given: "The Bomb" -- 
first two paragraphs are editorial introduction] 
  [Excerpt] In 1927 Soviet power sealed the Sarov monastery, 
renowned for the spiritual deeds of the venerable Serafim, once 
and for all. One year later an NKVD child labor colony was 
housed in the monastery buildings. In 1933 the colony was 
replaced by a camp where not only criminals but also Article 58 
victims served their time. In 1938 a small plant was built 
there which produced iron bedsteads, kitchen utensils, and 
skates, and it was from this latter product that the plant 
derived its nickname. During the war the "skate" plant 
manufactured howitzer shells and later produced Katyusha 
rockets. On 8 April 1946 a three-man commission arrived at 
Sarov: One member of that commission was Yu.B. Khariton, now a 
successful academician and three times a Hero. Within a year a 
special secrecy regime was introduced here and the city 
disappeared from the maps. 
  In present-day Arzamas-16 little remains of the Sarov 
monastery. Only the bell tower and the guest buildings escaped 
destruction.... In addition to the municipal museum and the 
"Sarov Monastery" museum, founded by local history enthusiasts, 
the city also has a most unique museum of nuclear weapons. Here 
you can touch the first Soviet atomic bomb with your own hands, 
reel in horror at the appalling dimensions of the thermonuclear 
bomb, see fragments of once top-secret films on atomic and 
hydrogen bomb tests, and hear the stern but, at the same time, 
exultant voice of the announcer saying: "A blinding flash! The 
raging elements destroy all the test installations within a 
radius of 4 km." When describing the super-bomb tests a kindly 
woman says, not without a note of pride, that the explosion 
produced a shock wave of such force that it would have gone 
round the globe three times. There used to be a monastery here 
-- it became a vast workshop producing weapons of awesome force. 
That is one image of the 20th century. 
  Nezhnyy: Stanislav Nikolayevich, a man in your 
post is something of an unknown quantity in a society like ours. 
So would you be so kind as to tell us a little about yourself. 
  Voronin: With pleasure. I am 63 years old, I was 
born in Yaroslavl, and in 1942 my brother and I were left 
without a father, our mother without a husband. It was wartime. 
After secondary school in Yaroslavl I studied at the weapons 
department of the Leningrad shipbuilding institute, where I 
received my diploma in 1954, specializing in torpedoes. I came 
to Arzamas-16 right away in order to make the bomb. As you can 
see, I am still here. I got married here and our children were 
born here... I have met and worked with some very interesting 
people here and learned a lot from them. Let me mention two 
names: Igor Vasilyevich Kurchatov and Yuliy Borisovich 
Khariton. Yuliy Borisovich is 90 years old but he is still 
working hard; you can find him at the institute on weekends and 
late in the evening. 
  Nezhnyy: What does it mean to create a nuclear 
weapon? 
  Voronin: First of all it is a very complex 
process. We are dealing with the very small segments of time in 
which the high precision mechanism of the charge and the 
munition operates, very high temperatures and very high 
pressures, which do not exist in practice in laboratory 
conditions. That is why experiments are very important for 
us.... 
  Nezhnyy: Nuclear tests? 
  Voronin: Yes. The magnitudes which we work in 
can only be calibrated by experiment. 
  Nezhnyy: Otherwise, the result is failure? 
  Voronin: We may not achieve the expected result. 
There were quite a few instances of that kind, and this makes 
us come back to the question of nuclear tests. Without them we 
cannot improve our weaponry. We can make minor improvements but 
there will be no major progress. 
  Nezhnyy: You say that tests are necessary, but 
the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of our planet would 
say if asked: To hell with you and all your explosions! Isn't 
that so? 
  Voronin: Do not portray us as some kind of 
monsters burning with a desire to carry out one test after 
another, ad infintum. No! Nevertheless, since life has forced 
the country to equip itself with its own nuclear weapons and 
since we have had to constantly improve them, they must be under 
reliable control. Control is all the more necessary in the 
conditions of our industry today, with its severed production 
ties and changes of suppliers and materials. After all, the 
replacement of materials could influence the characteristics of 
our product. Meanwhile we give a guarantee for the whole 
sequence of operations, as it were. That is why we simply have 
to check the condition that the products are in, whether they 
are still in a high state of readiness and reliability, and so 
forth. Otherwise they could become a threat to their owners. 
It is not only our specialists who adhere to that view but the 
Americans, too. We believe that as long as nuclear weapons 
exist they must be tested. In limited quantities and with very 
rigorous conditions regarding ecological cleanliness and safety 
-- but they must be tested. There is no other way. 
  Nezhnyy: So the aim is, on the one hand, to 
guarantee the reliability of the existing nuclear weapons 
arsenals and, on the other, to make progress in improving them. 
Is that why tests are necessary? 
  Voronin: Yes. 
  Nezhnyy: You have undoubtedly been present at 
nuclear tests? 
  Voronin: I went to Novaya Zemlya virtually every 
year from 1969 through 1989. Since 1963, as you know, testing 
has taken place exclusively underground. This costs more than 
testing in the atmosphere, of course, but it is ecologically 
cleaner and safer. They drill a well or, in mountainous 
locations, they cut a gallery, lower the charge into it... 
  Nezhnyy: Deep down? 
  Voronin: That depends on the yield. But as a 
rule it is usually deeper than 500 meters -- to prevent any 
discharges. 
  Nezhnyy: How do you feel during all this? 
  Voronin: Please do not think that I am saying 
this for effect, but you await an explosion with a tension which 
is really hard to describe. And then.... Then the ground 
begins to move under your feet -- and we are 10 km from the site 
of the explosion, sometimes closer. A roar begins. It is 
probably somewhat like an earthquake. 
  Nezhnyy: Does your institute conduct tests here 
around Arzamas-16? 
  Voronin: Yes. At sites a long way from the city. 
This is essential. Then you need a conventional explosive. We 
do not work with fissile materials here. 
  Nezhnyy: So the talk that everything here in this 
district is contaminated with radiation is.... 
  Voronin: Nonsense. We have a special service 
which monitors the air and the water. They are cleaner here 
than in Moscow. 
  Nezhnyy: That is fine. But then what you call a 
new product is created here. How long does that take? 
  Voronin: From conception to the completion of 
research work -- 5-8 years. The product contains the 
achievements of virtually all sectors of science and technology. 
Our institute is a multidisciplinary scientific center where 
all the spheres of physics, mechanics, mathematics, physical 
metallurgy, chemistry, and electronics are represented... It 
has one of the most powerful computer centers in the country. 
  Nezhnyy: Is the quantity determined by the state 
order? 
  Voronin: We have nothing to do with that. The 
client orders as much as he needs. For our part we monitor 
every product from beginning to end: manufacture, operation, 
dismantling, and recycling. 
[passage omitted] 
  Voronin: You want to ask me what my feelings are? 
  Nezhnyy: Yes. 
  Voronin: I always tell my colleagues: We make 
our weapons so as not to go to war with them. I do not think 
that intelligent people can ever use them. My whole life I have 
worked to ensure that this weapon makes it impossible even to 
contemplate the idea of beginning a war! In 1945 the Americans 
were able to drop "Little Boy" and "Fat Boy," but very soon even 
they had to think about the possibility of a retaliatory strike. 
Since then the task has been to preserve a balance of forces 
which makes it impossible to use nuclear weapons under any 
conditions. In this regard, admittedly, we and the United 
States overdid it and stockpiled vast nuclear arsenals. Now it 
is time to sort things out. Living alongside yields of this 
magnitude is inconceivable! Reduction is a noble cause. 
Nevertheless I do not think that the 20th century will see a 
final end to these weapons. Our children will still have to 
rack their brains to decide how to get rid of these weapons once 
and for all. 
  Nezhnyy: Stanislav Nikolayevich, what is the 
average age of staff at the All-Russia Experimental Physics 
Scientific Research Institute? 
  Voronin: Forty-two. 
  Nezhnyy: Is that high? 
  Voronin: Yes. But the average age of workers in 
science is 46. That is really high. The problem is that now we 
have virtually no young specialists coming through to replace 
them. In the past our work had prestige, and here at Arzamas-16 
the young specialist could enjoy a series of social benefits 
that were difficult to obtain back in European Russia, such as 
apartments, good medical services, recreation -- but now things 
are not only no better here than elsewhere, they are even worse. 
So no one comes out here to join us. 
  Nezhnyy: Yet the Federal Nuclear Center is 
Russia's national asset. Does the government really not 
understand that, does the president not realize it? 
  Voronin: Destroying a center is easy, creating 
one is incredibly difficult and nowadays I think that it is 
simply impossible. Just recently, it is true, things do seem to 
have happened. I told you that it takes us eight years to 
create a new product. That means that it needs a program. We 
proposed such programs long ago but they were ignored. Now 
interest has been shown in them, the government is creating the 
corresponding structures, and I am confident that in the end 
everything will work out right, these political games will end, 
and people will get down to work. 
  Nezhnyy: Does the brain drain not worry you any 
more? 
  Voronin: There are people who worked with us and 
who left for other republics of the CIS. They number just a 
few. No one, as far as I am aware, has yet gone further afield 
than that. In the main this brain drain is toward commercial 
structures, and these are good people who are leaving. 
Generally speaking if the economic situation gets worse the 
danger of the proliferation of nuclear technologies will 
increase. The state's duty and paramount obligation is to do 
everything it can to prevent this.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 0700 GMT on 30 January a 29-minute 
Test Range program devoted to nuclear disarmament. Reception is 
good. 
  The first segment is a brief satirical look at problems in 
the military. In particular, drug abuse in the Army is noted. 
An increase from 3,000 addicts in 1991 to over 9,000 in 1992 is 
noted. 
  The second segment of the show is of an undated three-minute 
interview between Air Marshal Yevgenniy Shaposhnikov and 
military commentator Aleksandr Zhilin. The interview covers the 
situation in the Crimea. Zhilin suggests that the Crimea may 
become a Karabakh between Russia and Ukraine. Shaposhnikov asks 
if the whole Black Sea Fleet, however glorious and grand, is 
worth creating a bloody situation between two great, fraternal 
peoples, linked together by centuries. He then notes that there 
will be no fighting between Russia and Ukraine. He says if 
someone thinks there will be, then that person should be put 
away somewhere safe, where he can rest with his Napoleonic 
visions. 
  The third segment deals with implementing provisions of the 
START treaties. Uragan transporters, fitted with specialized 
equipment, are seen arriving at the site of one or more missile 
shafts. Military personnel are seen putting on protective 
clothing. 
  There is a brief interview with an engineer familiar with 
the 
deactivation process. The process is described as a closed 
system, preventing any contact between fuel components in the 
missile and the atmosphere; an operation that guarantees 
ecological safety. 
  Footage from a helicopter over a testing range is shown 
next. 
Assorted debris from explosions or launchings is shown. 
  A narrator recalls that Russia is ill-equipped to either 
scrap its missiles, let alone clean up the single testing range 
of its strategic missile troops, which occupies an area of 
175,000 hectares. 
  During a brief interview with a junior officer, it is stated 
that 16,000 tonnes of detachable parts have accumulated from 
falls over the range during 35 years of its existence. The 
officer says four operations are now under way: 1) to reduce the 
guaranteed residue in the fuel supplies in missile boosters and 
to reduce the number of component fall areas; 2) to assess 
ecological situation in fall areas; 3) to clear up the fall 
areas; and 4) to keep the local population informed. 
  Dangers that Russia faces from aging nuclear weapons is 
highlighted next: over 30 percent of Russian warheads on standby 
will be in a dangerous condition in two years' time. 
  Footage of the (?Surovatikha) deactivation base is next 
shown. The camera pans around parked missiles which appear to be 
encased in tubular containers. An announcer notes that the 
Pebonzhur and Surovatikha facilities are the first Russian bases 
for liquidating intercontinental missiles. 
  The liquidation process is detailed next. Each SS-17 or 
SS-18 missile is first cleaned of dangerous fuel components, 
then painstakingly divided into separate fragments. The base 
can liquidate over 40 heavy missiles a year, freeing up to 1,000 
tonnes of expensive metals and alloys for industry. 
  Past methods of liquidation--via explosions--are noted. The 
problem of funding for new more efficient bases is mentioned. 
  Russian intentions to create a missile based on the SS-25 
are 
next described. It is stated that this new missile will be more 
vulnerable than the SS-18 as it will not be able to release up 
to 1,000 false targets to fool enemy antimissile defenses. 
Fiscal problems are again mentioned as an impediment in the 
design process. 
  The 29-minute program ends with the narrator expressing his 
hope for world nuclear disarmament.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1920 GMT on 29 January carries the regularly 
scheduled Top Secret program presented by Arten Borovik. 
Reception is good. 
  Today's program--The Nuclear Button--is devoted to nuclear 
weapons in Russia and the United States. Borovik starts the 
program by saying the nuclear threat still exists: the video 
shows a button on which is written "To execute the launch" 
[Russian: proizvesti pusk]. Borovik continues, noting that 
several weeks ago he visited a Russian nuclear missile base 
located not far from Moscow. The video show a rocket launcher 
aimed at the (?Warren) missile base in Wyoming. Borovik notes 
that in 30 minutes Russian missiles could reach the Wyoming 
missile facility. 
  At this point one General Gribov is identified as the 
commander of this particular Russian missile division. Borovik 
says that all officers and soldiers who work at the Russian base 
are regularly examined by doctors because the fate of out planet 
is in their hands. Borovik notes that none of the personnel 
know what the targets are for the Russian missiles; however, 
they know exactly whether a particular order is a training or an 
operational order. 
  The video continues with Borovik noting that there are many 
such nuclear missile bases throughout Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, 
and Kazakhstan. He notes that all these facilities are united 
in one single nuclear command center located approximately 25 
minutes driving distance from Triumfalnaya Arka in western 
Moscow, in a place identified as Vlasikha. 
  At this point in the show, Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev is 
identified by caption as the commander of this enormous nuclear 
facility, itself a legacy of the former Soviet Union. Col-Gen 
Sergeyev is cited as the commander in chief of the strategic 
missile troops. Borovik notes that Sergeyev was born in 1938 
and has been in missile troops since the initial days of 
inception. 
  At this point in the show, Borovik has a few comments about 
the nuclear weapons program in the United States. In 
particular, he notes the recent visit by a top Russian military 
delegation, led by Col-Gen Sergeyev. Borovik says this was the 
first meeting of professionals in this field. He goes on to 
describe in detail key aspects of the meeting: the video shows 
Col-Gen Sergeyev with other members of the Russian military 
delegation in the Pentagon. 
  Next in the program, Borovik incorporates an interview with 
scientist Aleksey Arbatov, identified as an expert for the Top 
Secret program. Arbatov is heard making several remarks 
regarding different aspects of nuclear weapons in Russia as well 
as in the United States. 
  Borovik then is seen asking Col-Gen Sergeyev about the 
position of the Russian nuclear missile troops during the coup 
in 1993. Col-Gen Sergeyev says: "I can only say that this was a 
very difficult time for everybody, including us. Our main task, 
whatever was happening, was to continue our guard duty, to be 
completely prepared, to professionally inspect operational 
posts, and to carry out measures for increasing protection and 
defense of operational launching positions in order to avoid the 
situation in which nuclear weapons become a card which somebody 
suddenly would like to play. This was out of the question: not 
because we are so good but because our lifestyle, our 
understanding of the dangerous and destructive weapons in our 
hands, our sense of responsibility in this difficult situation 
with respect to the fate of our people, for nuclear security, 
for strategic stability--I think all of these issues ensured 
that our missile specialist, as he is now and who, in these 
difficult conditions, is continuing to fulfill his duties." 
  Throughout the program, Borovik touches upon a very 
important 
question: who will give an order to push the nuclear button in 
case of war? Col-Gen Sergeyev states: "The command will be 
given in the established order. It must come only from the 
president." At this point, scientist Arbatov states: "According 
to our constitution, in the case of the incapability of the 
president, all his functions revert to the head of the 
government or the prime minister. Thus, this button, or better 
to say this difficult mechanism, will go to his legal successor." 
  Concluding the 50-minute program Borovik expresses his 
gratitude to the leadership of both the Russian and American 
Defense ministries for their help in preparing the program.

Nuclear Button" by Artem Borovik, identified by caption; figures 
in brackets denote broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and 
seconds] 
  [Excerpts] [192245 thru 192420 -- introductory passage 
omitted] 
  [192420] [Borovik over video of himself accompanied by two 
others, one in uniform, arriving at missile base] A few weeks 
ago our camera crew visited a Russian nuclear missile base 
located a few hours' traveling time from Moscow. We traveled 
first by train and then by military helicopter, and finally we 
arrived at the launch site, where an SS-17 missile with a 
multiple warhead is concealed in a silo. It is targeted on the 
Warren U.S. nuclear missile base located near the city of 
Cheyenne in Wyoming State -- the headquarters of (Dirk 
Jamieson), a U.S. 3-star general who commands land-based 
strategic missile forces. This missile would take 30 minutes to 
reach Warren base. 
  General Gribov, commander of this Russian missile division, 
descended with our camera crew to his underground labyrinth, 
which is well protected against the consequences of a nuclear 
explosion. It is possible to descend even further to reach the 
combat control console, from which 10 missiles can be launched, 
one of which we have just seen. [video shows Borovik proceeding 
along an underground corridor. An overhead inscription reads: 
"Command Post of Military Unit No. 14264"] The officers on 
duty here spend hundreds of hours a year in these nuclear 
underground corridors. Every time before they come on duty they 
have to pass a test to demonstrate their precise knowledge of 
the functioning of this equipment and the sequence of all their 
actions. They also have to undergo thorough medical and 
psychiatric tests several times a year, and routine checks prior 
to every duty tour. The fate of our planet is in these people's 
hands. They are not told where their missiles are targeted. 
Division Commander General Gribov also prefers not to know, 
although he is fully entitled to this knowledge. When a launch 
command goes out, our missile men know exactly how to 
distinguish between a training command and a combat command, 
while U.S. officers on duty at similar consoles are not told by 
their commanders which is a training command and which is for 
real. 
  Such missile army divisions are scattered throughout Russia 
and also Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Invisible nerves 
link them to a single nuclear center which is located a 
25-minute drive from the Triumphal Arch [video show arch) to the 
west of Moscow at a place called Vlasikha. The missile men told 
us that in the last century there was an estate here whose owner 
was popularly known as "Vlasikha." Only a few years ago these 
roads and traffic along them were controlled by our 
counterintelligence. Outsiders could not pass here without 
being stopped. 
  This whole vast nuclear mechanism of the former Soviet Union 
comprising many thousands of land-based missiles is under the 
command of Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief of 
the Strategic Missile Forces. [192700] [video shows missile 
site, silo, underground bunkers, commander saluting departing 
television crew, triumphal arch, road to Vlasikha, Sergeyev

  [192701 thru 200800 -- passage omitted consisting of brief 
biographical data of Igor Sergeyev; explanation of the 
differences between Russian and U.S. strategic missile forces; 
interview with Sergeyev interspersed with highlights of his 
recent visit to the United States where he was met by General 
Butler, hosted in the Pentagon, and shown Strategic Command

<F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "New Nuclear Missile Program: In </F>
10 Years' Time Russia Will Be Defended by Topols" -- first 
paragraph is editorial introduction; paragraph within slantlines 
published in boldface] 
  [Text] An arms development program has been drawn up for 
Russia's strategic nuclear forces through the year 2005. In an 
exclusive interview Lev Volkov, full member of the International 
and Russian Engineering Academies and corresponding member of 
the Russian Academy of Sciences, who was involved in drawing up 
the program, told IZVESTIYA's military correspondent about its 
contents. 
  Under the Treaty on the Reduction of Strategic Offensive 
Arms, Volkov said, the Strategic Missile Forces, which perform 
the role of chief deterrent force, may comprise 1,300 launchers 
with single-warhead ICBM's by the set deadline. But the 
country's actual economic potential will allow us to possess 
just 900 launchers. Which missile is to be chosen for this? 
  A number of Russian scientific collectives, independent ones 
included, have researched possible scenarios for strategic 
nuclear forces operations, modeled their dynamics, and come to 
the conclusion that the prospective Strategic Missile Forces 
grouping must comprise a standardized solid-fuel missile like 
the modernized SS-25 ICBM with two basing options: stationary, 
in launch silos; and mobile, on self-propelled launchers with a 
wheeled chassis. 
  /IZVESTIYA information: The SS-25 ICBM (in Russia it is 
called the Topol RS-12M) is considered one of the most 
successful off-road mobile missile systems. The missile is made 
in Votkinsk. It weighs 45 tonnes, and its throw-weight is 
equivalent to one tonne. It has been on alert duty in the 
Strategic Missile Forces since 1985. The general designer is 
Boris Lagutin./ 
  Why has the SS-25 been chosen from among the six existing 
types of missiles? In Lev Volkov's opinion, there are several 
reasons for this. First, it uses solid fuel, which is safe in 
operation, and this in itself provides a substantial gain. 
Second, it is very economical. Given our infrastructure of 
existing and possible position areas, the road network in them, 
special geological features, the cost of capital construction, 
and the availability of housing for officers and their families, 
such a missile will be most affordable. 
  At the same time the optimum ratio of stationary and mobile 
missile systems has also been established: 60-70 to 40-30. 
  Specialists proceeded from an assessment of their combat 
efficiency and cost. It transpired that the average expenditure 
per warhead whose delivery to target can be guaranteed is for 
mobile-based single-warhead missiles practically coincident with 
the expenditure for stationary launchers with the now accepted 
degree of protection. If the silos' degree of protection is 
increased, their cost could end up almost twice that of mobile 
systems. 
  Incidentally, Lev Volkov said, it is known that there have 
been eight disasters involving the operation of nuclear-powered 
submarines with nuclear missiles on board in the naval strategic 
nuclear forces of our country and the United States. Nuclear 
munitions have been lost, and people have died. There have been 
similar occurrences with aircraft. But God has spared the 
Strategic Missile Forces. According to specialists' 
calculations, the probability of an incident involving a mobile 
launcher is estimated at one in 100,000 in the course of a year. 
That is, if 500 SPU's [?self-propelled launchers] are operated 
for 10 years, there could be a 5-percent probability of an 
incident involving one of them. 
  In industry such a probability is considered safe. 
  I asked Lev Ivanovich why the Americans abandoned the 
Midgetman land-based mobile system if they are so efficient and 
safe to operate. The reason is simple: By the year 2005 the 
United States will have 18 nuclear-powered submarines with 
powerful and highly accurate Trident-2 missiles (1,728 warheads 
in all) capable of hitting both pinpoint and area targets. This 
is more than enough for a deterrent. They have no need to spend 
money on new development. 
  We will not do this either.

<F P=106> [Ruslan Ignatyev report under the "Only in ROSSIYSKAYA </F>
GAZETA" rubric: "Sarcophagus for Submarine Komsomolets"] 
  [Text] Russian specialists and scientists have proposed a 
unique method of preserving the submarine Komsomolets which sank 
7 April 1989 in the Norwegian Sea approximately 180 miles 
southeast of Bear Island. Studies have been going on for 
several years, expeditions have been organized, and hundreds of 
options have been examined. As a result one option has been 
selected -- the best one. It involves the construction of a 
sort of sarcophagus. The Committee for Carrying Out 
Special-Purpose Underwater Operations has been tasked with 
coordinating the project. Its Chairman Tengiz Borisov 
familiarized the editorial office with this unusual project. 
  The nuclear submarine Komsomolets has now been lying on the 
bottom of the Norwegian Sea for almost five years. Today we can 
say that it was the pride of the former Soviet Union's Armed 
Forces. It was the only submarine of its kind in the world: 
The most up-to-date and most deep-water. The Komsomolets could 
dive to 1,000 meters, whereas an ordinary submarine could only 
go as far as 400 to 600 meters. The vessel had a multipurpose 
design. To use the language of military pilots, it could be 
deployed as a fighter and a ground-attack aircraft. The 
Komsomolets was to have destroyed missile-armed submarines and 
carrier strike groups composed of aircraft carriers and escort 
ships, and it could also direct long-range fire against onshore 
targets.... 
  This supersubmarine cost our state over 1 billion rubles at 
old prices (in present-day prices this is approximately 1 
trillion). However, the Komsomolets was in fact unable to serve 
the Motherland. During a routine patrol it caught fire and 
sank. A total of 20 conventional torpedoes and two fitted with 
nuclear warheads went down with it. The latter gave cause for 
concern because there was a danger they would contaminate the 
environment with radioactive substances. 
  The very first expeditions to the accident site confirmed 
the 
specialists' fears. The radiation situation in the vicinity was 
not good. A second set of studies backed up the previous 
findings with new information. In the final analysis, the 
situation at the site of the Komsomol wreck was such that all 
permissible norms had been exceeded many times over. This 
provoked a negative reaction from a number of countries. The 
decision was then made to raise the Komsomol. 
  A number of countries offered to help in formulating a plan 
to raise the submarine from the bottom of the Norwegian Sea. 
They included states such as the United States, France, Italy, 
and Sweden. Dozens of proposals were also put forward by our 
own scientists and designers. The special commission received 
plenty of interesting and promising options. For example, some 
specialists suggested using cryogenic technology. That is to 
say they planned to freeze the submarine and lift it in the form 
of a block of ice. Others insisted on dismembering the 
Komsomolets with a view to coaxing each part out of the watery 
depths separately. Still others sought a way out of the problem 
by using an enormous overhead crane. There were also, to put it 
mildly, one or two quite unrealistic plans. Thus some people 
tried to demonstrate that the vessel could be pumped full of a 
special foaming material which would turn into foam rubber and 
ensure the buoyancy of the submarine, which would then float to 
the surface of its own accord. Another very simple method would 
be to latch onto the Komsomolets with a kind of lasso and tow it 
toward the shore.... 
  Meanwhile the former USSR party leadership issued a decree 
tasking the appropriate organizations and departments with 
carrying out the work necessary to raise the sunken submarine. 
The aim was to establish the real reason for the wreck of the 
Komsomolets and to remove the torpedoes with nuclear charges. 
But there was a hitch, because the state lacked the funds to 
carry out an operation of this sort (at the time about $300 
million were needed). 
  However, expeditions to the bottom of the Norwegian Sea 
showed that it has also become impossible to raise the submarine 
from the technical point of view. This is why. 
  Using the manned deep-sea submersibles Mir-1 and Mir-2, it 
has proved possible to descend to the site of the sunken 
submarine. Here, at a depth of 1,700 meters, it is pitch black. 
The searchlights shining out of the portholes picked out a wall 
of "snow." It seemed as if a blizzard was raging at the bottom 
of the Norwegian Sea. Apparently there is a large accumulation 
of plankton in precisely this area. It hampered attempts to 
follow the planned route. The submersibles encountered a number 
of small and medium-sized fish along the way. 
  The specialists were able to determine the exact position of 
the submarine. It is lying atop a 40-meter-thick silt incline. 
Further on there is a precipice and an increase in depth. The 
Komsomolets is lying level on an even keel. The submarine's 
position encouraged the specialists to think that they could 
execute their plan to raise the vessel. 
  After a thorough examination of the submarine it became 
apparent that the inner hull was badly damaged. It has 
practically been blown in two in the vicinity of the forward 
compartment, even though the fire occurred in the stern. A 
study of video materials and a comparison of information 
obtained during the expedition showed that a powerful explosion 
had occurred on the vessel. This could have happened during the 
depressurization and flooding of the submarine or at the moment 
when it hit the bottom. This explosion damaged the submarine. 
  For the first time our specialists were able to go inside 
the 
Komsomolets using remote-control robots. A terrible picture 
unfolded before the investigators: Smashed flooring, decks, and 
all sorts of structures had formed massive obstructions. The 
submarine's systems, instruments, and equipment had been 
transformed into scrap metal. They were unable to find the 
bodies of any sailors. 
  Robots the size of large vacuum cleaners entered the 
Komsomolets through gaps in the hull and two open portholes. 
They reached the torpedo apparatus. They not only examined the 
forward cover assemblies enclosing the warheads, but also the 
tail sections of the torpedoes. The conclusions drawn by the 
specialists were very sorry indeed; the beryllium screens -- the 
neutron deflectors which are a design feature of the warheads 
and which prevent the plutonium from spreading -- were heavily 
corroded and partially destroyed. In the scientists' opinion, 
these screens will only last until the end of this year or the 
middle of 1995. They will no longer be in any state to hold 
back the radioactive material inside. As a result, a total of 
400 curies -- an extremely dangerous dose -- will leak into the 
environment. For the purposes of comparison, a total of 0.38 
curies was discharged into the water in the Far East. This led 
to an international outcry. Here, however, we are talking about 
a discharge 1,200 times more potent! 
  Basically, with every day that passes the nuclear warheads 
aboard the sunken submarine are being destroyed as a result of 
electrochemical corrosion on a large scale. While the 
Komsomolets was ablaze on the surface, military pilots 
photographed it from the air. These photographs show that the 
water around the submarine was literally boiling. These high 
temperatures caused the submarine's special coating to peel off. 
And owing to the difference in temperature between the inside 
and outside of the submarine, the vessel basically exploded. 
  Naturally, it is quite impossible to disturb or manipulate a 
heavy, cumbersome object weighing almost 10,000 tonnes and 
measuring 117 meters in length (with a diameter of approximately 
10 meters) in such a condition. Otherwise the hull would split 
in two and the protective structures of the torpedo apparatus 
would fall apart. It is impossible to guess in advance what the 
consequences of such an environmental disaster might be. This 
is why specialists have started to look for a way of 
neutralizing the Komsomolets that avoids having to bring it to 
the surface. 
Of all the suggestions they have received, the specialists 
from Arzamas-16, the "Rubin" Central Design Bureau, and the 
Committee for Carrying Out Special-Purpose Underwater Operations 
under the Russian Federation Government have picked the safest 
-- constructing a kind of sarcophagus in the submarine's nose 
section. Work on this project has been completed. It has been 
coordinated with a dozen ministries and departments and handed 
over to the State Environmental Expert Committee. 
  The initial plan was to construct an external sarcophagus. 
In other words, the intention is to cover the submarine's nose 
cone with concrete at a depth of 1,700 meters. But calculations 
have shown that on soft ground with a density of just 1.8, the 
Komsomolets could break up. It was then decided to construct an 
internal sarcophagus. But in this case it was assumed that 
special substances would be used -- sorbents capable of 
absorbing any plutonium that escapes. Eight such sealants were 
approved in a test during the latest expedition. They performed 
well. But specialists have chosen the very best. At the moment 
they are running them through yet more tests. 
  This summer a new expedition will set off for the sunken 
Komsomolets. Some 100 kg of sorbent will be pumped into the 
interior [mezhbortnoye prostranstvo]. After this all the 
hatches and cabins will be sealed. Constant environmental 
monitoring will be organized in the area. 
  The operation to construct the sarcophagus at the site of 
the 
accident and the wreck of the nuclear submarine Komsomolets is 
slated to take two months. The work will be financed by the 
Russian Federation Government.

  [Text] On 3 February, the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs held a news conference concerning the results of Deputy 
Foreign Minister Alyaksandr Sychow's visit to Great Britain, 
France, and Germany, which was devoted to the resolution of 
issues concerning assistance to Belarus in dismantling its 
conventional arms. 
  According to the agreement on reducing conventional arms, 
Belarus has to destroy 10 times as many tanks as Great Britain, 
50 times as many as France, and 1.7 times as many as the United 
States. The first stage of this agreement has already been 
carried out; however, some difficulties are expected in the 
implementation of future stages. According to Alyaksandr 
Sychow, the aggravating economic situation in Belarus draws on 
the increase in expenses for the dismantling of military 
equipment. According to economic expert evaluations, Belarusian 
expenditures will amount to about $8 million. According to 
provisions for the first stage [of reductions], Belarus has 
destroyed 645 tanks, 658 armored combat vehicles, and 50 
aircraft. It is still necessary to destroy 1,212 tanks, 566 
combat vehicles, and 80 aircraft. Due to the difficult economic 
situation, the Republic of Belarus is not able to finance these 
projects. Yet, as stated at the news conference, during its 
visit, the Belarusian delegation did not receive any support for 
the resolution of financial problems threatening the dismantling 
of military equipment. The Belarusian delegation informed the 
participants in the agreement on the reduction of conventional 
arms in Europe that the term of this agreement may be broken by 
the Belarusian side. 
  In the near future, a delegation of British, French, and 
German experts is expected to arrive to Belarus to examine the 
situation firsthand.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>
  [Text] Leninsk February 10 TASS -- During his official 
visit to Kazakhstan, which ended today, Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev had talks with Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev on the Baykonur cosmodrome. It was agreed to set up 
a special working team to study the problem. It is to draw up a 
draft agreement on this unique scientific complex for the 
Russo-Kazakh summit, scheduled for the end of March. 
  Kozyrev visited the Baykonur cosmodrome on the last day of 
his official visit. He was accompanied by Kazakh Foreign 
Minister Tuleutay Suleymenov. 
  Baykonur holds pride of place in the history of world 
science, especially cosmonautics. This is from where mankind 
had for the first time ventured into outer space, turning a new 
page in the history of civilisation. The world's first 
artificial earth satellite was orbited from Baykonur in October 
1957. The first cosmonaut, Yuriy Gagarin, was launched into 
outer space from there in April 1961. 
  The first "Buran" reusable vehicle was launched from 
Baykonur 
in 1988. The international space observatory "Granat," orbited 
from there in December 1989, is still functioning in outer 
space. It is designed to carry out strategic observations and 
to study cosmic, roentgen and gamma rays. Russia, France, 
Bulgaria and Denmark are taking part in the project. 
  A spaceship, carrying a Soviet-Australian expedition, 
including a representative of Kazakhstan, was launched from 
Baykonur for the first time in the 40-year-long history of the 
space centre, on October 2, 1991. The next stage of the 
cosmodrome's history was marked by the launching of a Soyuz 
TM-13 rocket. This event ushered in a new era in the 
cosmodrome's history. 
  Kozyrev overflew the installations of the cosmodrome and 
talked to the heads of Baykonur's military and civilian 
personnels. Taking part in the talk was Colonel-General 
Vladimir Ivanov, commander of the Military Space Forces of the 
Russian Defence Ministry, Acting Chief of the Baykonur 
Cosmodrome Major-General Viktor Grafinin, and head of the 
Leninsk Administration Vitaliy Brynkin. 
  In accordance with a decree signed by the Kazakh president 
in 
1991, all the enterprises, organisations and institutions on the 
territory of Kazakhstan were declared Kazakh state property, 
including the Baykonur cosmodrome. Naturally, this posed new 
difficult problems before the complex. It will not be an 
exaggeration to say that Kazakhstan is unable to cope with all 
the problems linked with the exploitation of this unique space 
complex. Suffice it to say that Russia had spent 47 billion 
roubles to keep Baykonur going in 1993 alone. Ninety-four per 
cent of all the spendings on the complex are borne by Russia and 
only six per cent by Kazakhstan in accordance with an agreement 
concluded between the two countries. As much as 259 billion 
roubles will be required to finance Baykonur in 1994. 
  During the meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Chief 
of the Cosmodrome Viktor Grafinin said that 22 launchings of 
different space vehicles, both military and civilian, were 
effected from Baykonur in 1992, and four in 1994, including one 
piloted vehicle. Dwelling on problems facing the cosmodrome 
today, he laid accent on two main problems -- determination of 
the cosmodrome's status and solution of tasks linked with the 
social protection of its personnel. 
  Kozyrev flew to Moscow right after his tour of Baykonur 
installations.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>
  [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev told Interfax that a 
military cooperation treaty with Russia would be signed shortly. 
He had sent a draft of the treaty to Russia's Boris Yeltsin 
"back in March," following which the two governments were told 
to finalize the document. 
  The document "tackles the issues of military cooperation and 
use of testing grounds in Kazakhstan and the Baykonur space 
launch pad." Nazarbayev explained that the treaty also provided 
for training of Kazakh officers in Russia, cooperation in 
manufacture of weapons and coordination in drafting a common 
military doctrine. 
  "If we are to create a common defense space, which is what 
Kazakhstan wants, we have to cooperate very closely in border 
protection, personnel training, military doctrine and other 
areas," the president said. 
  In his view, the Russian army would have to spend huge sums 
of money to build new testing grounds if it ceased to use those 
in Kazakhstan. Over 32.5 Mn hectares were in the past used for 
testing grounds while making such large areas available for 
military needs is out of the question now. Kazakhstan is 
prepared to lease the installations there on mutually beneficial 
conditions. 
  The Kazakh president dismissed the reports that Almaty had 
demanded that Russia pay $7 Bn yearly rent for the Baykonur 
launch pad. He emphasized, however, that Russia was not the 
sole country that kept Baykonur in working order. Kazakhstan 
supplied 1 Bn kW hrs of energy yearly to Baykonur which also 
used underground water, which "is in short supply in the 
Syr-Daria River." New buildings in Baykonur were constructed of 
Kazakh materials. "For this reason, the expenses of renting 
Baykonur for joint operation by Ukrainian, Russian and Kazakh 
rocketry are being computed," Nazarbayev said. 
  (Interfax Note: Russian and Kazakh negotiating teams in the 
talks which started in Moscow Monday are discussing the text of 
a new agreement on the status and operation of the launch pad 
and the town of Leninsk. According to a spokesman for the 
Russian Space Agency, the treaty on the lease of Baykonur and 
the issue of which legislation would be in existence in the 
areas rented from Kazakhstan are issues that will be discussed 
shortly.) 
  The president thinks that discussion of the status of 
Russian 
troops in Kazakhstan would be premature at this stage. He said 
that he had an understanding with Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, with whom he had met in Davos, Switzerland, during 
the World Economic Forum, on having experts to meet in early 
February in order to hammer out an agreement on the issues 
involved. 
  Nazarbayev rejected accusations of conservative thinking 
leveled at Chernomyrdin and his new government by the Russian 
press and recalled that Chernomyrdin's activities during the 
Moscow events of October 3 and 4, when he was unambiguously on 
President Yeltsin's side, had been welcomed by the mass media. 
Now it is wrong to describe him as a hardliner even before the 
government has announced its program, the Kazakh president said. 
  Currently any Russian government "will have to stay on the 
course of reform," Nazarbayev thinks.

  [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- Kazakhstan does not 
recognize the Baykonur space launching grounds as a Russian 
military base and demands its demilitarization, as the Kazakh 
Constitution proclaims the absence of foreign military bases on 
republican territory, Kazakh state adviser Tulegen Zhukeyev told 
a meeting of Russian and Kazakh experts here today. 
  A Russian-Kazakh intergovernment memorandum on "Mutual 
Understanding in Maintenance of the Baykonur Space Launching 
Grounds" was signed a month ago and membership of an 
intergovernment commission for Baykonur has been confirmed. The 
commission is expected to prepare draft bilateral documents on 
status and conditions of the use of Baykonur and the town of 
Leninsk and rent of Baykonur and Leninsk facilities within two 
months. 
  Under the memorandum, Russian military units were to 
temporarily stay on Baykonur territory and the launching grounds 
themselves were to be rented by Russia. However, the Kazakh 
side continues to insist on Baykonur demilitarization, meanwhile 
preparations and launches of rocket boosters and spacecraft are 
so far impossible without servicemen of the Russian aero-space 
forces. The Russian side wants to rent Baykonur which is in 
principle supported by Kazakhstan. 
  The rent term is so far unclear (a rent period of less than 
30 years is inefficient for Russia). Kazakhstan has its own 
notion of the rent and it will be the most difficult to agree on 
the rent amount. Thus, Russia may have to boost the creation of 
its own launching grounds (a project of the sort is already 
available) to include defence and security tasks now solved only 
in Baykonur. 
  Another acute question is the Kazakh demand for compensation 
for the damage done by Russian organizations at Baykonur space 
launching grounds and other three testing grounds located on 
Kazakh territory. According to estimations, the full cost of 
restoration of basic assets and Russian compensation for 
1992-1993 maintenance and use of Baykonur and the testing 
grounds exceeds seven billion U.S. dollars. 
  Baykonur seems to be used for bargaining and pressure on 
Russia. It has been established that the population was harmed 
only by nuclear tests in Semipalatinsk, and not a single nuclear 
explosion was registered there since the moment Russia 
proclaimed sovereignty. Thus, Russia cannot be responsible for 
damage done to the population in the past.

<F P=106> [Article by Baykonur Cosmodrome Chief Aleksandr Shumilin </F>
under the "Space" rubric: "Rockets Still Blast Off. What Lies 
in Store for Baykonur?"] 
  [Text] The mass media of many countries readily publish 
materials on the fate of Baykonur Cosmodrome. The business, 
scientific, and political world is concerned about the problem 
of preserving this unique creation of human hands. 
  "Farewell, Baykonur," "The Destruction of Baykonur Is the 
Tragedy of the Century," "Nightmare at the Cosmodrome" -- this 
is a far from complete list of the headlines in Russian and 
foreign newspapers and magazines. 
  But what is the true state of affairs? In an attempt to 
answer this question, representatives of the U.S. firm of Anser 
[name as transliterated] -- Messrs. R. Dalby and B. Alexander -- 
visited Baykonur last year. After spending less than two days 
at the cosmodrome and viewing the launch and technical complexes 
of the Soyuz, Proton, and Energiya carrier rockets (30 minutes 
at each complex), the guests happily set off home. Not even a 
high-class specialist is able to assess the technical condition 
of very complex systems in such a short space of time, apart 
from forming an impression of their outward appearance. But the 
U.S. experts drew hasty conclusions without a moment's 
hesitation: "The breakup of the USSR has not affected 
Baykonur's potential." In their haste the gentlemen from across 
the ocean did not attach any significance to the following 
"trifle": Of the 40 major organizations involved in 
implementing space programs in past years, just over 10 are left 
today. The test cosmodrome now functions only thanks to 
military specialists carrying out their official duty in bleak 
climatic conditions and in the humiliating position of an 
indeterminate legal status. The potential of the military 
contingent, which is fatigued as a result of everyday troubles, 
is not infinite, however. Meanwhile, the U.S. experts maintain 
that the tragic situation in which the servicemen find 
themselves has been "greatly and deliberately" exaggerated. 
This is allegedly being done for the sole purpose of 
"squeezing" more money out of the government. 
  But why did the Americans need to "put a gloss" on the 
situation? It is no secret that a worldwide struggle is being 
waged for a place in the "space Klondyke." And anything goes in 
this struggle, as the saying goes. Baykonur really is in need 
of serious assistance to maintain impeccable technical 
readiness. One or two glitches in carrying out international 
programs, and it would mean the end of the world reputation of 
the unique complex. Is this not the version that the gentlemen 
from Anser had in mind? 
  P. Berlin, another U.S. expert, is still more subtly cunning 
when he concludes: "The risk in contracts for commercial 
launches appears insignificant." In short, the cosmodrome is in 
full order, with the exception that there is "no comfort" at 
Leninsk. Not that this will hamper commercial launches in any 
way. And yet Mr. Berlin must know that it is only possible to 
win the competition for a commercial satellite launch by giving 
the client solid service, including a high-class hotel, "car 
keys," excellent roads to the launch site, and so on. Leninsk 
is not ready for this today. Additional capital investments are 
also needed, otherwise Russia will quit the space market 
empty-handed. 
  More than 20 delegations from the United States, France, 
Germany, India, Turkey, and other countries have visited the 
cosmodrome recently. Guests arrive at the invitation and under 
the patronage of Russian firms such as the "Energiya" Science 
and Production Association, the M.V. Khrunichev Association, the 
Space Research Institute, the Russian Space Agency, and the 
National Aerospace Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The 
delegations are different, but they are all united by one thing: 
Not once has anyone deemed it necessary to notify the 
cosmodrome's command of their visit. 
  On the other hand, both the Kazakhstani press and Russian 
newspapers keep "chewing" over an old story with a persistence 
worthy of better application -- the cosmodrome's servicemen want 
to create a military space base on the republic's territory. 
The local newspaper altogether accuses us of wishing to 
"militarize space." 
  The most popular "refrain" in numerous local press 
statements 
is the assertion that the Republic of Kazakhstan is the 
cosmodrome's master. Askar Nurmanov, a specialist of the 
Kazakhstani Aerospace Agency, declared: "We unexpectedly found 
ourselves the possessors of such a structure and were not ready 
to exploit it." I will comment that considerable funds, in 
addition to high-class specialists (whom Kazakhstan does not 
have today), are needed for the normal "exploitation" of the 
cosmodrome. According to last year's estimates, 38 billion 
rubles are needed annually. 
  Until this year, however, this sum was distributed between 
Russia and Kazakhstan in the following proportion: Russia paid 
94 percent, and Kazakhstan just 6 percent. Since Baykonur is 
located on Kazakhstani soil, this implied that the rest was 
covered by leasing the land allocated to the cosmodrome and the 
landing zone. 
  As far as this is legitimate, let the economists and 
financiers -- in short, those whose job it is -- resolve 
matters. To date a whole package of documents regulating many 
questions has already been adopted. There is the creation of an 
open-type joint-stock company at the cosmodrome. The granting 
of privileges to all specialists who come to us to work. 
Finally, a memorandum has been signed which attempts to 
regulate the interests of all the sides involved in fulfilling 
space programs. 
  Unfortunately, as practice has shown, many documents do not 
entirely remove the tension. But the main point is that efforts 
are being made to this end. 
  We are prepared to meet journalists and experts, specialists 
and dilettantes, to show and tell them everything the way it is. 
Our only request is one which Mikhail Bulgakov expressed 
exhaustively on addressing young litterateurs: "Write what you 
see, and do not write what you do not see!"

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Vinogradov: "Almaty Demands Billion </F>
Dollars for Its Uranium"] 
  [Text] Kazakhstan intends to get the full amount [poluchit 
spolna] for the uranium contained in the warheads of the 104 
SS-18 missiles located on its territory. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev said this in Kiev, where he is on an 
official visit. The Kazakh president pointed out that he is 
ready to sign a new agreement with Russia either on a bilateral 
basis or on a quadrilateral basis involving Ukraine and Belarus. 
In the next few days he will be going to Washington to discuss 
these problems with Bill Clinton. 
  Russia believed that the matter of compensation for the 
nuclear material in the strategic missiles due for removal from 
Kazakhstan was in principle closed. There are agreements on 
this point. Almaty, like Kiev and Minsk, should receive its 
share after deduction of expenditure on the reprocessing of 
highly enriched uranium and its transportation and storage at 
Russian plants. 
  However, all the indications are that the method of 
calculation adopted earlier does not suit the Kazakh side. It 
intends to follow the example of Ukraine, which succeeded a week 
ago in obtaining $1 billion on signing the trilateral agreement 
with Russia and the United States in Moscow. This money is 
being given to Ukraine out of the sum appropriated by the U.S. 
Congress for the nuclear disarmament of the CIS countries under 
the START I treaty. It has become known that Almaty is hoping 
for similar compensation. 
  In other words, Kazakhstan, like Ukraine, has decided not to 
wait for funds to come into its account from the sale of uranium 
by its Russian partners, whom it is not inclined to trust very 
much. It is obviously safer to get insurance now, in the form of 
a guaranteed billion out of the U.S. quota. 
  Experts believe that in that event Russia will have to take 
on additional expenditure for the safe dismantling of nuclear 
warheads in the possession of its CIS neighbors. It cannot be 
rule out that Belarus will demand its share in the same way, 
although some of the uranium has already been shipped out of its 
territory to Russia for reprocessing. When it hosted Bill 
Clinton recently, Minsk received $100 million from this same 
package. But now, REUTER reports, Belarus is laying claim to a 
further $500 million.

  [Text] Tehran January 28 TASS -- "Kazakhstan bears 
responsibility for its nuclear weapons itself. It does not 
intend to eliminate them or transfer them to other places until 
the non-use of such weapons is guaranteed at the world level and 
the planet gets rid of them," Ambassador of Kazakhstan in Iran

  [Text] Moscow, 28 January -- In an interview with an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent, a highly placed representative of the 
leadership of Kazakhstan today categorically rejected a report 
that appeared in the Iranian newspaper `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' about 
a special position that Kazakhstan was supposed to have adopted 
over the nuclear weapons in its possession. 
  The report, he stressed, had nothing in common with 
Kazakhstan's position, which was confirmed during the December 
visit to Almaty by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
and by the forthcoming signing of an agreement with Russia on 
the strategic nuclear forces temporarily stationed on the 
territory of Kazakhstan. 
  In response to a request from an ITAR-TASS correspondent to 
comment on the Iranian newspaper report, a high-ranking Russian 
diplomat said that, if it were true, it required "careful and 
urgent verification, primarily by Kazakhstan."

  [Excerpt] Rome, 28 Jan -- Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of 
the Russian Government, who is on a visit, acquainted himself 
today with the report from Tehran that Kazakhstan is changing 
its stance on the elimination of the nuclear weapons on its 
territory. Valentin Sergeyev, head of the Russian Government's 
press service, said this in an exclusive interview with the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  V. Sergeyev said that "the Russian premier expresses his 
doubts that the statement made by the Kazakhstan ambassador to 
Iran reflects the official position of Almaty. All the more so 
since Kazakhstan has not informed the Russian Government about 
such a change in its position. Viktor Chernomyrdin will have 
the opportunity to meet Nursultan Nazarbayev at the World 
Economic Forum in Davos, to which they have both been invited. 
Anyway, such issues should be resolved through talks with all 
the interested parties participating, including Russia, and not 
in a unilateral manner." [passage omitted: recap of Kazakhstan's

Pribytkov] 
  [Text] Davos (Switzerland), 29 Jan -- Kazakhstan's official 
position on the problem of nuclear weapons is determined by the 
agreements that were signed by us, Kazakhstan's President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev stated in an interview given to the 
ITAR-TASS correspondents. Kazakhstan's head of state is in 
Davos to take part in the world economic forum that is being 
held here. 
  "In December last year Kazakhstan acceded to the Treaty on 
the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and ratified it," he 
said. "My official visit to the United States will take place 
in mid-February and there we will exchange ratification 
instruments. The Supreme Council of Kazakhstan has also 
ratified the START I Treaty. True, we did carry out a great 
deal of work before that." This was completed during the 
meeting in Moscow of the presidents of Russia, the United 
States, and Ukraine; and Belarus made a contribution to this, 
too. 
  There were several points at issue. "The first was the 
guarantee by the nuclear states that there will be no nuclear 
attack on Kazakhstan," Nursultan Nazarbayev continued. "We now 
have this guarantee, including from China. The second point was 
that the cost of the enriched uranium in the nuclear warheads 
should be returned. An agreement on this has been reached with 
the United States. The third point was economic matters, 
investment in Kazakhstan, and economic integration with the 
Western states, including the United States. When agreement was 
reached on these three issues, we went ahead with the 
ratification of the treaties on nuclear problems." 
  The president stressed that "Kazakhstan has never wanted to 
be a nuclear power, if only because 500 nuclear charges were 
exploded on the territory of Semipalatinsk Oblast, including 87 
in the air and 107 on the surface. Hundreds of thousands of 
people are still suffering and Kazakhstan was left to face their 
problem alone. I closed down that test site by decree. From 
this everyone will understand Kazakhstan's striving to rid 
itself of these weapons and not have them on its territory."

  [Text] A delegation from the Latvian Saeima, consisting of 
representatives of all the groups, has returned from a visit to 
the United States of America. Deputy Andrejs Pantelejevs today 
told a news conference that the aim of the visit was to discuss 
the issues of Latvian national security. 
  The delegation was also received by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. It became 
clear during the talks that the United States of America viewed 
the withdrawal of the Russian Army not only as Latvia's internal 
issue, but rather as a problem of all-European and American 
security systems. 
  One of the most complicated issues is the fate of the 
Skrunda 
radar station. Russia has expressed the wish to use it for 
another four years and after that, it will scrap it within 18 
months. In that case, Russia would withdraw all the troops from 
Latvia by 31 August this year. That is the best option which 
Latvia would have to accept, said Deputy Jevgenijs Zoscerinskis. 
Such a compromise would satisfy all the European countries. 
  Deputy Maris Grinblats for his part assessed the results of 
the visit very briefly -- they tried to persuade us that the 
world would be glad if we give in on this issue.

<F P=106> [Address by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at a Supreme </F>
Council session in Kiev -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Esteemed Ivan Stepanovych, esteemed people's 
deputies. The issues that have been submitted for your 
consideration are of an exceptionally important significance. 
Without exaggeration, the future of Ukraine as an independent 
state depends to a large extent on the the decision you will 
adopt today. As you know, on 18 November 1993, the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine adopted a resolution on the ratification of 
the START Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol, with certain 
reservations. Among other things, it also contained an 
instruction to the president of Ukraine and the government to 
hold appropriate negotiations between interested states and 
international organizations with the aim of due protection of 
both Ukraine's security and its material interests, which would 
open possibilities for the START I Treaty to enter into force 
and would initiate the process of genuine international nuclear 
disarmament. 
  You are aware of the world's reaction to the adopted 
resolution. After this decision made by the parliament, Ukraine 
stood before the threat of full isolation, and the negative 
image we earned for our state because of this began to intensify 
to a level which opened the possibility of imposing more than 
just economic forms of pressure. [passage omitted] 
  The nuclear weapons inherited by Ukraine from the former 
USSR 
not only cannot be used to support Ukraine's security, but are a 
threat to it. We do not have the appropriate scientific nor the 
manufacturing infrastructure -- for which tens of billions of 
dollars are needed -- to independently manufacture new nuclear 
weapons, nor do we have a place where such weapons could be 
tested. I hope that the majority of people and people's deputies 
of Ukraine had the possibility to see and hear the opinions of 
leading Ukrainian scientists on this issue, which was shown on 
Ukrainian television. If we cannot be a true nuclear state and 
gain something positive from this, then why not accede to the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, along with the other 180 world 
states? [passage omitted] 
  Ukraine is now being accused of something very serious: If 
we 
do not act in accordance with the position we announced earlier, 
we are halting further world disarmament. START II comes under 
threat, and it is this for which Ukraine is being accused. 
Although the state of our economy and the possibility of 
reforming it depends in the first instance on us -- and this is 
true -- without support from international financial 
institutions, leading Western states, and not only with money 
but also with experience, private investments, and the granting 
of access to their markets, we will not manage. Certainly we 
would not be able to manage without the Russian market. 
  Can we really expect the development of normal, I stress, 
normal relations with Russia without deciding this painful 
problem? If someone thinks we can then he is deeply mistaken.

<F P=106> [Address by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at a Supreme </F>
Council session in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed Ivan Stepanovych, esteemed people's 
deputies! The issues that have been submitted for your 
consideration are of an exceptionally important significance. 
Without exaggeration, the future of Ukraine as an independent 
state depends to a large extent on the decision you will adopt 
today. As you know, on 18 November 1993, the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine adopted a resolution on the ratification of the START 
Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol with certain reservations. Among 
other things, it also contained an instruction to the president 
of Ukraine and the government to hold appropriate negotiations 
between interested states and international organizations with 
the aim of due protection of both Ukraine's security and its 
material interests, which would open the possibilities of the 
START I treaty entering into force and would initiate the 
process of genuine nuclear disarmament in the world. 
  You are aware of the world's reaction to the adopted 
resolution. After this decision of the Supreme Council, Ukraine 
stood before the threat of full isolation, and the negative 
image that our state earned because of this, began to intensify 
to a level that opened the possibility of imposing more than 
just economic forms of pressure. 
  In the present economic crisis situation, this has already 
concealed a threat to the very existence of the Ukrainian state. 
It is precisely to avoid this danger that, in accordance with 
my instruction, trilateral negotiations were held with the 
United States and Russia, with the aim of justly resolving the 
problems of nuclear weapons, to drag Ukraine away from the 
interminable conflicts with Russia and the world community, and 
to concentrate our international efforts on the creation of 
favorable external conditions for carrying out deep reforms in 
Ukraine's economy. 
  The statement and appendix signed in Moscow, even though 
they 
are not international agreements, define the political 
obligations of the three presidents within the framework of 
compromise reached between the three states in resolving the 
problems of nuclear weapons that Ukraine inherited from the 
former USSR. The text of the statement and the appendix are 
proof of the realization of Ukraine's strategic policy in 
acquiring nonnuclear status that was defined in the declaration 
on state sovereignty, in Supreme Council statements on Ukraine's 
nonnuclear status, and parliamentary resolutions on additional 
measures to guarantee that Ukraine acquires nonnuclear status. 
None of the resolutions adopted by the Supreme Council has cast 
doubt on this policy. 
  In particular, the accords achieved in Moscow envisage -- 
after the START I Treaty comes into force and Ukraine accedes to 
the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty] -- the granting to 
Ukraine of guarantees for its national security, which include 
pledges regarding confirmation, concerning Ukraine, of its 
independence, sovereignty and existing borders, and refraining 
from threats of force or the use of force or measures of 
economic pressure. 
  The next thing envisaged is the pledge by the United States 
of America to grant Ukraine the appropriate funds for the 
dismantlement of nuclear weapons, with the possibility of 
increasing the volume of such assistance in the future. 
  The withdrawal of all nuclear warheads from Ukraine to 
Russia 
for their dismantlement is envisaged with the concurrent 
granting of compensation in the form of deliveries of fuel 
assemblies to Ukraine for its nuclear power engineering 
requirements. 
  Apart from that, and this is of especial political 
significance, it was confirmed that Ukraine, the United States, 
and Russia will cooperate between themselves as equal partners, 
and that relations between them should be developed on 
principles of respect for the independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity of each state. The United States also 
stated its readiness to render assistance to Ukraine in creating 
a market economy in Ukraine. 
  Some people say that the text of the statement does not 
fully 
correspond to the reservations formulated by the Supreme Council 
because it supposedly departs from specific figures of 
limitations regarding elimination of warheads and carriers 
[nosiyi] fixed in Point 6 of the 17 November resolution. 
  But this same article says that this same point makes it 
possible to destroy nuclear weapons in excess of the established 
limitations. That is, the executive power received the authority 
to agree on the dismantlement of warheads, the process (?of 
destruction) of which should take place in compliance with 
procedures, which have not been established by the START I 
Treaty. 
  That is, the point is that we strove to carry out those 
maximum possibilities laid down in the Supreme Council 
resolution, but naturally certain compromises are inevitable in 
these cases. Thus, the tripartite statement and the appendix to 
it, and also their implementation, in our opinion, and this is 
true, meet the demands set forth in the resolution of the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine of 18 November 1993. 
I emphasize, the principle reservations, principle 
reservations by the Supreme Council have been carried out by the 
executive power. This is a reply to our just doubts and the 
reservations with regard to the resolution by our Supreme 
Council. In connection with this, I introduced a proposal 
through a legislative initiative in accordance with Article 103 
of the Ukrainian Constitution, on the removal of the 
reservations contained in the Supreme Council resolutions dated 
18 November 1993 regarding Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, and 
Ukraine's accession to the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons. 
  It seems that the issue of the need for Ukraine to accede to 
the NPT that was at the center of attention not only here in 
Ukraine, but also in the whole international community, should 
be obvious and understood by everyone who lives in the real 
world. This corresponds to Ukraine's long-term national 
interests, including the interests of guaranteeing our national 
security. It is true that some either consciously or 
subconsciously are twisting the facts, attempting to prove that 
Ukraine could become a nuclear state; that because of this its 
security would supposedly increase and its importance in 
international relations would grow, and that we could defend our 
independence, territorial integrity, and the future flourishing 
of the Ukrainian people with nuclear weapons. I repeat, data 
about the real state of affairs demonstrate that it is simply 
impossible to defend this thesis if one knows and listens and 
take these realities into account. 
  The situation for our military men, leading scientists and 
nuclear workers, and other experts who are involved with this 
affair is absolutely clear. I remind you of some irrefutable 
facts. First, the nuclear button, i.e. the entire command 
infrastructure necessary for the targeting and launching of 
missiles is located, as before, in Moscow. Nobody, and this 
must be taken into account, will allow us to take over this 
control without unforeseen consequences as some people naively 
suggest. Such actions could only provoke the emergence of an 
acute military danger for Ukraine. I repeat, it will not protect 
Ukraine's security, but will provoke the emergence of a danger. 
  Since nuclear weapons located in Ukraine are not controlled 
by us, they cannot play the role of a factor restraining a 
potential aggressor. They cannot. As it is known, strategic 
missiles that are on combat duty in Ukraine today are a threat 
only to the United States. And it seems that everyone 
understands it is not preparing to attack us. But there is also 
a danger for us through the dangerous condition of the missiles 
because of the lack of supplies of vital components, first of 
all from Russia. Beginning from this year, the guarantee 
period, not only of combat capability, but simply of safe 
storage of a considerable number of warheads, is being 
terminated. In 1995 this process will take on a catastrophic 
nature. Specific calculations and data are proof of this. But 
the moment that the nuclear warhead guarantee period is 
exhausted, it becomes a danger for others and a danger for us, 
i.e. for those on whose territory they are based. Such nuclear 
warheads must be taken away to be dismantled and reprocessed 
since, as you know, we do not have the appropriate factories. 
But the weapons' manufacturers are in Russia. If we do not do 
this, then there could be a danger of a new tragedy, this is a 
reality. I think that it is a great responsibility for us all. 
Through our Defense Ministry, I received an appropriate 
decision from the chief designers of the nuclear warheads. I 
would like you to know about this and probably there is now no 
need to conceal it from the Ukrainian people. 
  Now I will read this in the original. In connection with the 
fact that the service life of certain warheads expired, we moved 
them out [of Ukraine] at the end of December to be dismantled. 
Designers provide us with the following data: [switches to 
Russian] I inform you about the decision by the chief designers, 
developers of nuclear warheads, coordinated with the 
interdepartmental commission of the Ministry of Nuclear Power 
Engineering and the Ministry of Defense of Russia, on the 
results of the defect-finding inspection [defektatsiya] of the 
three combat units whose term of technical servicing expired and 
which were delivered from Ukraine. 
  During the visual inspection of the combat units, the 
commission members found corrosive products on the surfaces of 
the uranium parts that are the source of heightened toxic and 
radiological danger. Proceeding from the results of the work 
done by the commission, the chief designers arrived at a 
conclusion that the violation of the rules of technical 
servicing of nuclear warheads leads to the emergence of 
irreversible processes of aging in them, to the changes in 
physical and chemical properties of dangerously explosive and 
radioactive materials. The above phenomena increase the danger 
during the nuclear warheads' dismantling. Further use and 
storage of these warheads aggravates the processes taking place 
in them, which may lead to the formation of dangerously 
explosive mixtures within their hermetic capacities. [back to 
Ukrainian] 
  Here is such a piece of information. I would like to tell 
you that my consultations with relevant scientific institutions 
in Ukraine and the scientists who are involved in this, confirm 
this assessment and this danger. 
  So, the nuclear weapons inherited by Ukraine from the former 
USSR not only cannot be used to support Ukraine's security, but 
are a threat to it. We do not have the appropriate scientific 
nor the manufacturing infrastructure -- for which tens of 
billions of dollars are needed -- to independently manufacture 
new nuclear weapons, nor do we have a place where such weapons 
could be tested. I hope that the majority of people and people's 
deputies of Ukraine had the possibility to see and hear the 
opinions of leading Ukrainian scientists on this issue, which 
was on Ukrainian television. If we cannot be a true nuclear 
state and gain something positive from this, then why not accede 
to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, along with the other 180 
world states? 
  Why should we insist on preserving the situation as it is, 
whereas at the meetings between the president or other leaders 
of Ukraine and world leaders, or at the diplomatic talks, or at 
any other meetings, those with ordinary people and the mass 
media, they always begin the talk with one and the same thing: 
People just do not understand why we are insisting on exactly 
such a stand. 
  Though some people believe that the world's concern about 
Ukraine's attitude toward nuclear weapons is for the benefit of 
Ukraine, that this adds to our state's authority. Well, at this 
point they somehow forget that before the signing of the 
trilateral statement, Ukraine had increasingly often been placed 
in one group of states that have an unequivocally negative 
reputation throughout the world. I felt this personally, and 
the foreign minister who was taking part, as they say, from the 
Rome to the Brussels meetings, and who is present here, will 
have a chance to share his impressions with you. 
  The fact that the problem of nuclear arms stationed in 
Ukraine remained in suspense had, until recently, been one of 
the main obstacles in the way toward a full-blooded development 
of mutually advantageous cooperation with foreign countries. 
After the Supreme Council had adopted the resolution on the 
START ratification, they were emphasizing it straightforwardly 
and unequivocally at all levels, that until Ukraine ratified the 
Lisbon Protocol in full volume and joined the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, the rendering of effective aid toward 
building a market economy would be just impossible. 
  Moreover, it was difficult to hope for a normal attitude 
toward us on the part of many countries of the world. They say 
that this is the dictate. One can agree with this. We, they 
say, must show our protest. But to do this we should act in 
compliance with the obligations that we assumed and not ruin the 
situation that took shape. 
  Ukraine now is being accused of something very serious: If 
we 
do not act in accordance with the position we announced earlier, 
we are stopping further world disarmament. START II comes under 
threat, and it is this for which Ukraine is being accused. 
Although the state of our economy and the possibility of 
reforming it depends in the first instance on us -- and this is 
true -- without support from international financial 
institutions, leading Western states, and not only with money 
but also with experience, private investments, and the granting 
of access to their markets, we will not manage. Certainly we 
would not be able to do without the Russian market. 
  Can we really expect the development of normal, I stress, 
normal relations with Russia without deciding this painful 
problem? If someone thinks we can then he is deeply mistaken. 
  In this connection, I would like to say this: It is exactly 
now that we have almost managed to completely reach an 
understanding of our problems, the main one of which being the 
readiness to assist us in the complicated matter of reforming 
the economy on the part of leading Western countries and 
international institutions. Our nearest neighbors' attitude to 
us is also different now. 
  Just now, we have received a statement on behalf of the 
chairman of the European Union, saying that the trilateral 
accords, reached in Moscow, open the way for the development of 
full-scale, fruitful relations and cooperation between Ukraine 
and the European Union. During his stay in Kiev, U.S. President 
Bill Clinton assured us that the United States had made use of 
their ability to influence leading international financial 
organizations in order to provide the assistance we need. 
  The delegation that held negotiations in Washington last 
week 
reports that we have already seen a fundamental change in the 
attitude toward Ukraine of both the United States and the 
international community, the International Monetary Fund, and 
the World Bank. They are ready to provide our state with 
considerable financial and technological assistance and credit. 
A mechanism has been initiated to realize this assistance in 
all-sided economic cooperation. The details of this are known 
to you, I hope, from the joint statement that has been made 
public. These, strictly speaking, are some of the first 
reactions and proposals. I am sure there will be others that 
will be no less serious. 
  Everything will now depend on us alone and our readiness to 
make use of this moment and these possibilities, and to unite in 
performing our most important task today, which task, in my 
view, is to curb the crisis trends in our economy and carry out 
serious reforms in the direction of creating a democratic state 
and a socially-oriented market economy. 
  I would once again like to emphasize this: Today, the future 
of Ukraine as an independent, influential and -- in the future 
-- a prosperous European state, does not depend on nuclear 
weapons. The former USSR had more than enough of them, but 
however, did not come to its rescue. The future of Ukraine 
depends on the economic well-being and social stability of our 
society. If we do overcome the current economic crisis, we will 
be able to safeguard our independence and inviolability of our 
borders. Nor will we -- once again with the help from 
international organizations -- allow anyone to interfere in our 
internal affairs. 
  I think the time has come -- and a decisive time it is too 
-- 
for every one of us present in this hall, to once and for all 
understand that in order to make a realistic policy, really 
aimed to protect our vital national interests and those of all 
ordinary people, one should first of all conscientiously look to 
reality, weigh up the possibilities, and finally be ready to 
take serious and responsible decisions. I am (?more than) 
convinced that it is exactly this decision that Ukraine needs to 
make today. 
  Thank you for your attention.

<F P=106> [Question and answer session with Ukrainian President Leonid </F>
Kravchuk by deputies, following speech by Kravchuk on nuclear 
issues at Supreme Council session in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] [Dorohuntsov, not further identified] Esteemed 
Leonid Makarovych, I know that you signed the statement and an 
appendix to this statement, which is not very simple and is not 
very easy for Ukraine. I believe that you were forced to do so. 
That was a political decision which will have very important 
consequences for Ukraine, and you have probably assessed these 
consequences. I support your stand and I will vote in its 
favor. Unfortunately, I believe that we do not have an 
alternative. 
  However, I have the following question for you. As is known, 
our disarmament -- the technical details are up to specialists 
and we are not specialists -- requires significant expenditures. 
What will Ukraine's share -- if there is no possibility to 
express it in absolute figures -- of these expenditures be, and 
what will the share of the so-called world community be? This 
is a very serious question for us. I think here we could do our 
best to take as much as possible; unfortunately, it is not us 
who make these decisions unilaterally. So, I would only like 
you to express your opinion on this matter. In addition, it 
would possibly be good if this brief discussion of ours is 
broadcast in full. Thanks for your reply. 
  Kravchuk: True, when a resolution is being adopted 
in this hall, or some law, we try to write down in it our 
maximum needs and our maximum benefits, and this can be 
understood. And when the law or some resolution is implemented, 
and when more than one country -- and here three or four 
countries are involved -- compromises are inevitable, otherwise 
one would never adopt anything. Not to adopt a decision at a 
time when there is a Supreme Council resolution and to drive 
this problem into a blind corner would mean extremely grave 
consequences and a threat to the security of Ukraine, and not 
only Ukraine. 
  I underscore that I was guided by the reservations, which is 
the main thing. Second, in order for you to understand, I was 
guided not by the pressure which was applied and which always 
exists, but by the realities facing Ukraine. And the realities, 
which I have already told you about, are these: Today Ukraine 
cannot safely maintain and service the nuclear weapons which we 
inherited. These weapons are becoming obsolete and pose a 
threat to us. If one fails to understand this, the rest is 
derivative. If we act appropriately, others will adopt an 
appropriate attitude toward us. As far as specific expenditures 
are concerned, relevant calculations are already available. 
Both the United States and the European community already say 
that the financial aid figures for dismantling the nuclear 
weapons will be doubled. 
  Second [as heard], the warheads will be dismantled in 
Russia, 
and Ukraine will be compensated for them according to world 
prices, less the expenditure for their dismantling. 
  The next steps connected with silos and launcher vehicles 
will be agreed upon on the basis of other agreements to be 
worked out on the basis of the resolution. This is because 
there are problems here. We cannot blow up the silos because 
they are located in densely populated areas. However, these 
issues will be stipulated in other agreements. Today the talk 
is about the fundamental decisions and about those fundamental 
decisions which the Supreme Council reservations dealt with, and 
we are trying to implement them. 
  Yakheyeva: Tetyana Yakheyeva, Electoral District 
No. 438. First, I have a procedural comment to make on the 
president's legislative initiative. This probably relates to 
the lawyers that he consulted. Leonid Makarovych said that he 
submitted to the Supreme Council a draft resolution on the 
accession of Ukraine to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. 
The treaty itself, however, was not submitted to the Supreme 
Council. I would like everyone to know about this. This is 
like adopting a resolution bringing a law into effect, with the 
law itself having not been under consideration. 
  Second, esteemed Leonid Makarovych, I have several very 
short 
questions. The following situation has arisen on the issue of 
nuclear weapons: Our executive power is governed exclusively by 
statements and declarations, being purely political documents, 
and pays no heed whatsoever to resolutions and laws adopted in 
Ukraine, or to its military doctrine or foreign policy. This is 
why I have this question to you: Do you think the implementation 
of this trilateral statement is obligatory for executive power? 
  The second question is this: What agreements were concluded 
during the negotiations on the fulfilment of the reservations? 
For example, was any agreement concluded on the civilian use of 
silo launchers, compensation, or anything else? Was it or was 
it not? 
  Finally, the last question: According to the foreign media, 
which writes in the words of members of the American delegation, 
some secret accords were reached during these negotiations, the 
contents of which will forever remain unknown to anyone. Were 
such accords reached or is it untrue? Thank you. 
  Kravchuk: ned&gt;  I would like to start from the end. A 
package of all the documents which were signed was published. 
Other protocol records related to purely technical matters 
rather than, shall we say, any issues of principle, because it 
is about elimination, withdrawal, their procedure, character, 
the timetable, and so on, and not about political documents, 
which would be of an obligatory nature and which were published 
in the press. In other words, what you are probably referring 
to is these protocol records. I cannot say anything else, I 
have not read it, so unfortunately I do not know what the press 
writes about. 
  Is the statement of an obligatory nature? The statement is 
of an obligatory nature in that we now -- except, shall we say, 
that we, on the basis of existing reservations and of the 
Supreme Council's resolution -- can act accordingly, having 
implemented these reservations with regard to 36 and 42 percent 
of the missiles subject to elimination and reduction. We can 
act right now. So in this sense it is of an obligatory nature, 
because it corresponds with the Supreme Council's resolutions. 
It does correspond with it. 
  As for what you are saying about other agreements, I have 
already said that these issues are settled after decisions of 
principle are made. Then the issues of specific agreements, 
specific issues, are settled. They by all means will be made at 
governmental and inter-governmental level after being worked on 
by experts. This is a whole number of documents rather than one 
document.

<F P=106> ["Concluding" address by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk </F>
at a Supreme Council session in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] To begin with, I shall answer some of the comments 
made and questions asked here. First of all, about a legally 
binding document on compensation to Ukraine for nuclear weapons. 
As for strategic nuclear weapons, such a document was signed 
with Russia and it is legally binding. It was signed by the 
Russian and Ukrainian premiers, [Viktor] Chernomyrdin and the 
then [Ukrainian prime minister Leonid] Kuchma. As for 
compensation for tactical nuclear weapons, by all means there 
will be this compensation. As early as this month experts will 
begin to work on determining the value of these weapons. They 
are experts from Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. Thus, 
on the main issue on the agenda here, that is, on compensation 
for nuclear weapons to Ukraine, one part of it was legally 
settled and the other will be settled after the evaluation of 
these nuclear weapons. 
  This, I tell you, is what it is in reality. There is an 
absolutely specific accord on the part of Ukraine: Should one of 
the sides fail to fulfill its obligations, Ukraine for its part 
will stop actions. 
  Next, there is no agreement -- and I do not know where what 
was said here comes from -- on the destruction of missiles, 
including SS-24's. There is no such a thing, I emphasize this. 
What it is about is lowering the combat status of missiles, not 
destroying SS-24's. This is quite another matter. It is about 
lowering their combat status. As for withdrawing them, we shall 
determine what warheads will be withdrawn and not the 
destruction of missiles, as was said here. Not a single 
document mentions this. Why distort facts? This is a question 
of principle. 
  I emphasize -- please do not interrupt me -- it is 
specifically about lowering their combat status and withdrawing 
200 warheads within 10 months, without specifying what warheads 
and from what missiles. 
  Next, I have nowhere and never said that I will withdraw 
[nuclear warheads] independently from the Supreme Council 
decision. I address this reply to Mr. Hudyma. The talk was 
about the following: When the nuclear warhead becomes physically 
obsolete and when Ukraine faces danger, then irrespective of the 
decision, whether taken by the president or the Supreme Council 
-- and the defense minister was saying about this, by the way, 
people will not say this is not true -- then the [nuclear 
warheads] will have to be withdrawn. Because there will be a 
dilemma: Either danger or nuclear warheads. I have said this 
and I am saying this to you. As for everything else, the 
president's actions will be adequate to the Supreme Council 
decision. 
  Another question arises. I want to tell you about this 
sincerely. If we withdraw the warheads according to an 
agreement, this is an appropriate legal document and a process 
of compensation. If we withdraw in the face of danger, then the 
question will be put in a different manner by those who accept 
[the nuclear warheads]. It is not by chance that I read the 
message from the chief designer, or, [to be more precise], a 
group of chief designers. This is a question of principle and 
one must take it into account. 
  I can fully support those deputies who are saying that not 
everything has been done neatly over this time, both on the part 
of the president and on the part of the government, that we have 
made many mistakes and that it is really true that we have been 
put in complicated economic, political, and international 
situations and that these situations require appropriate 
actions. And if someone has other possibilities for such 
actions, then let him offer them. I have been acting in line 
with the decisions of the Supreme Council and I was striving to 
achieve the fulfillment of those decisions. 
  One more thing: Not a single country can ever claim that all 
agreements should be concluded with it in advance, before it 
determines its final status. We have to determine our status. 
If we are a nonnuclear state, then we have to exercise this 
status consistently. And after that the agreements are 
concluded -- both the defense minister and Vasyl Vasyloyvych 
Durdynets [deputy chairman of the Supreme Council] have partly 
enumerated those agreements which are envisioned for signing: On 
the value of compensation, on silos, on withdrawal, on schedules 
-- everything will be done without fail. Not a single move can 
be made without such agreements because it would be dangerous to 
make such moves and nobody would do this. 
  I understand that today it is difficult to make decisions, 
there are political problems, there is pressure applied on 
Ukraine. They are right who say that Russia should abandon its 
claims to Ukraine. But these claims were made by that Supreme 
Soviet which no longer exists. There is another Supreme Soviet. 
Now that country must determine itself and I support those who 
raise this question, but you must understand that there are 
relevant procedures and a relevant order. I cannot force the 
Duma or the Federal Assembly of Russia to cancel these 
reservations, as far as the former Supreme Soviet is concerned. 
Russia itself will determine whether or not thse [reservations] 
are legal. And, in the long run, this is the legal and 
constitutional right of the Duma and the Federal Assembly. We 
can only propose that such steps should be taken. 
  We are facing economic problems which must be solved. And if 
we stop or block, as People's Deputy Haysynskyy said, this 
process in the presence of all those economic difficulties and 
absence of possibilities to act, both in relation to power 
engineering, nuclear power stations, and fuel elements, then we 
shall have to face the dilemma: Either [to be] or [not to be]. 
  I would like to assure you, esteemed people's deputies, that 
Ukraine will be compensated for both tactical and strategic 
nuclear weapons. I would like to tell you that today, at 
lunchtime, I received a letter from U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
in which he gave his consent to double economic aid to Ukraine 
-- specific figures, serious figures are mentioned [in the 
letter], to provide assistance in eliminating nuclear weapons 
and to provide aid to those officers who need social protection, 
including housing. 
  As a matter of fact, I was acting in a situation which took 
shape, I was acting so as not to do harm to Ukraine, so as to 
preserve the state. Maybe, someone else can do it better. Now 
it is up to the Supreme Council. I would only like to say that 
we must take steps consistently. And this consistency was 
initiated by the Supreme Council and I believe that this Supreme 
Council must also say its final word, [to finish] what it once 
began. 
  Thank you for your attention.

<F P=106> [Speech by Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy to the Supreme </F>
Council in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed Leonid Makarovich [Kravchuk], Ivan 
Stepanovich [Plyushch], esteemed people's deputies: The degree 
of confidence which you showed in me when you confirmed me in 
the post of minister of defense of Ukraine, and those tasks 
which you set me, oblige me to report to you in an honest and 
dignified manner, not on the basis of instructions and requests, 
attuned to someone's orders, but proceeding from the point of 
view of military and technical reasons supported by our 
scientists -- Ukraine is a state with rocket and space 
capability [raketno-kosmichna derzhava]. We have virtually 
everything for this. We only need to discard the nuclear 
symbolism for the sake of the economy. I am quite certain of 
this. 
  Analyzing our steps on the whole of the complex path to the 
resolution of the nuclear problem in Ukraine, we consider that 
this path has been consistent and on the whole right. This work 
was conducted under the leadership of the Supreme Council. All 
of the legislative acts which were adopted by the Supreme 
Council regarding the nuclear problem show that Ukraine has 
gradually been moving toward a non-nuclear status. 
  I have already reported in detail on all of these steps and 
resolutions at a joint session of the relevant Supreme Council 
commissions. Taking all of this into account, and also the fact 
that strategic nuclear weapons located in Ukraine are not a 
factor deterring an attack by an aggressor on our state nor a 
guarantee of its security, we consider that the next step of the 
Supreme Council of ratifying the START I Treaty on 19 November 
1993 was entirely proper and logical. 
  Esteemed deputies, at the same time you know that the 
relevant reservations in the ratification of the START I Treaty 
by the Supreme Council of Ukraine unfortunately did not diminish 
international tension, but on the contrary complicated the 
problem of strategic nuclear weapons located in Ukraine even 
more, and especially where Russia was concerned. In such a 
situation it was necessary to act in a very considered way. We 
believed that, to the extent that we could convincingly show the 
world and our people the rightness of our legal and other 
actions regarding nuclear weapons, both the international 
prestige of Ukraine and the domestic situation in the state 
would depend on this, and so would the strategic prospect of our 
national security to a considerable extent. 
  Therefore we at the Ministry of Defense believed that of the 
whole set of nuclear issues our main task was to define our 
stance above all on the technical state of the nuclear weapons 
deployed in Ukraine. In the implementation of the resolution on 
ratification of the START I Treaty and the instruction of the 
president of Ukraine by the Ministry of Defense and myself 
personally, the state of nuclear weapons of the 43d missile army 
and (?the) long-range air force was thoroughly analyzed. 
Together with leading specialists and scientists of Ukraine, I 
personally inspected the situation at all nuclear facilities. 
  The work which was carried out allows me to report to you, 
esteemed deputies, the following conclusions, which from the 
point of view of military and technical reasons determine the 
necessity of a gradual withdrawal of nuclear warheads [yaderni 
boyeprypasy], which in accordance with their technical state 
have gone beyond the guarantee service period. 
  I consider that the main thing is that the nuclear warheads, 
with which intercontinental ballistic missiles are equipped, 
constitute very complex technical apparatus, for the creation of 
which a lengthy and extremely expensive process of design, 
testing, and production is needed. To date Ukraine has not had 
the possibility of resolving these tasks. Nor will it have in 
the near future. There is no scientific and production base for 
creating nuclear weapons in our state. There are no ranges to 
test them on, nor specialists in recycling nuclear warheads. 
  And the main thing, esteemed deputies, is the economic 
condition of our state. To continue, one should also take 
account of the fact that a tough and obligatory condition of the 
safe maintenance of nuclear weapons is the uninterrupted 
scientific and technical accompaniment to its operation, which 
consists of constant supervision [kontrol] and regular 
inspection of the state of nuclear warheads (?and of elaborated) 
scientifically grounded technical decisions regarding the 
possibility and conditions for further operation of nuclear 
warheads [yaderni boyevi bloky]. From the practical aspect, the 
design offices and plants, manufacturers of nuclear weapons 
located in Russia, are obliged to carry out such scientific and 
technical accompaniment. But today they are not carrying out 
these measures, and on the contrary are blocking them. 
  It is also necessary to emphasize that the guaranteed 
service 
periods of a considerable number of nuclear warheads located in 
Ukraine are expiring or have already expired. It could happen 
that unsupervised [nekontrolyovanyy] physical processes which 
are occurring in nuclear warheads will be unforeseen, and the 
state of nuclear weapons will become critical. 
  The impossibility of replacing gas reactors, whose guarantee 
service periods have already expired, in nuclear warheads causes 
especial concern. The said reactors are produced in Russia and 
are not arriving in Ukraine. To date more than 300 (?nuclear) 
reactors have accumulated in our state, which need urgent 
replacement. 
  In addition, the storage of nuclear weapons in repositories 
remains a complex problem. Thus, when a large number of nuclear 
warheads are located in nuclear technical units, the level of 
their nuclear safety is lowered and leads to the loss of the 
guarantee of the chief designer. That which is in the 
repositories of the nuclear technical units of the 46th missile 
division consists, together with SS-24 missiles, (?of) 60 
nuclear warheads, the investigation of three of which showed, 
which our president spoke about, that irreversible physical and 
chemical processes are occurring. The extent of the (?danger of 
explosion) of radioactive materials of the warheads is 
increasing drastically. 
  The list of violations determining a critical state of 
nuclear and ecological safety could be continued. Taken all 
together, they could lead to an accident, the consequent scale 
of which could potentially exceed the Chernobyl disaster. 
Esteemed deputies, I pray to God not to let this happen. 
  One cannot not emphasize that the state of nuclear safety is 
also affected by the condition of missiles, the servicing of 
which is also not fully carried out and with violations of the 
operational demands and normative documents, I (?do not) have in 
mind specialists from Russia. The conclusion is that proceeding 
from what has been set forth above, the further maintenance of 
nuclear warheads [yaderni boyeprypasy] on the territory of 
Ukraine presents a danger not just for Ukraine and Russia, but 
also for our other neighboring states in Europe and the Near 
East; in the event of an accident, they will find themselves in 
the zone of radioactive contamination. 
  Thus because of the circumstances of the necessity of 
implementing the demands in the resolution of the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine on ratification of the START I Treaty 
concerning conducting further talks, meetings, and accords -- as 
a result of this the trilateral statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, and the appendix to it, 
are a necessary and logical step in the matter of Ukraine 
acquiring a nonnuclear status, and on the whole resolve 
positively all military-technical issues of nuclear weapons in 
Ukraine. 
  We believe that with the aim of guaranteed implementation of 
the demands of the trilateral statement and the appendix to it 
it is necessary during further talks with the Russian Federation 
to elaborate and sign a number of documents to determine the 
time periods, procedure, and conditions for the transfer of 
Russian nuclear warheads. The following should be included in 
these documents: a schedule for dispatching the first group of 
nuclear warheads over 10 months; an agreement regarding the 
procedure and conditions for supervision on the part of Ukraine 
over the dismantlement and recycling of nuclear warheads at 
enterprises of the industry of the Russian Federation; an 
agreement on compensation to Ukraine on the part of the Russian 
Federation for the value of the transferred warheads; an 
agreement on warranty inspection and servicing by the 
manufacturer of the state of nuclear warheads over the whole 
period of their being in Ukraine, including the process of 
transportation to Ukrainian facilities and to bases at plants of 
Russia's industrial enterprises; a protocol on the mutual 
obligations of Ukraine and the Russian Federation regarding the 
grouping of strategic nuclear forces in Ukraine and conditions 
of joint supervision over the state of nuclear missile weapons. 
  (?As regards) equal relations over the period of the 
reduction of nuclear weapons with states of the nuclear club, 
including with the United States, and after the START I Treaty 
comes into force and Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty of 1 July 1968, they should be 
equivalent to those measures which are taken concerning 
supervision of the reduction of nuclear armaments by every 
state, and incidentally under the supervision of our specialists. 
  I consider, esteemed deputies, that I should draw your 
attention to another aspect of the nuclear problem. This is 
about the fact that, notwithstanding the reduction of strategic 
nuclear weapons, we will have a very careful attitude to keeping 
the personnel and infrastructure of the 43d missile army. This 
is in general of great value, I mean both the specialists and 
the material base. All of this can in the very near future be 
successfully used, not just in the interests of the state's 
military security, but also for civilian needs. 
  I believe that the accords achieved by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia in Moscow on 14 January 
of this year on the whole resolve positively virtually all 
military-technical issues of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which 
satisfies the conditions of nuclear disarmament determined in 
the resolution of the Supreme Council of Ukraine of 18 July [as 
heard] 1993. And I would ask you, esteemed deputies, to support 
the proposals of our president. Thank you for your attention.

<F P=106> [Olga Musafirova report: "May We Join?.. The Ukrainian </F>
Parliament Will No Longer Stymie the Nuclear Disarmament of the 
State"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- It was simply a crushing victory for Leonid 
Kravchuk. Once again he mixed his supporters and opponents 
together in the Supreme Council to produce new political loaves 
in the way that a good housewife kneads dough. Leonid 
Makarovich listened carefully first to the microphone on the 
left which promised him the Nobel Peace Prize and then to the 
microphone on the right which threatened him with Article 56 of 
the Criminal Code for treason on a specially large scale. And 
all this for a three-page statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia delivered in Moscow on 14 
January. 
  Meanwhile the stove had been lit and the loaves knew that 
they would have to leap into it. Ukraine's nuclear weapons are 
-- thanks to the economic policy of the last two years -- the 
only commodity which the West has dreamed of buying here, buying 
in order to destroy them. 
  However, the Supreme Council was required not to sign but, 
on 
the contrary, to erase something, to strike out its so-called 
"warnings" over an article in Protocol Five of the START Treaty 
as enshrined by decree in November 1993 so that the document was 
not at odds with the three-page statement of the presidents 
which had already been agreed upon. 
  The situation was lent special piquancy by the fact that the 
"Moscow pact" -- neither the statement itself nor the appendices 
to it containing specific figures and deadlines for Ukraine's 
nuclear disarmament -- did not need ratification at all. And 
the debates in parliament guaranteed their participants profound 
moral satisfaction only. 
  Leonid Makarovich bore the blows of fate in worthy fashion. 
He forgave his attackers: "I understand it is a difficult 
decision for you to make..." He encouraged those who thought 
like him: "I received a letter from Clinton at lunchtime. He 
writes that he is doubling economic aid to Ukraine." True, the 
real issues remained off stage: The questions of interest to 
the technicians and professionals like Kuchma of how modern 
solid-fuel SS-24 missiles are going to be scrapped if the 
technology for recycling them does not yet exist in the world; 
who will solve the problem of utilizing weapons-grade plutonium; 
what to do with the abandoned missile silos, and so forth. A 
purely political rather than a comprehensive approach to nuclear 
disarmament can only result in either blatant deception of the 
whole world or upheaval within the Ukrainian state system. But 
the president was as good as his word: He exerted his influence 
and led people toward a compromise. 
  With just a couple of minutes to go before the end of the 
working day parliament was persuaded that it was being taken 
into account, established a quorum, and pushed the "yes" button. 
Unconditional ratification of START I was carried. The new 
decree was prepared by the president himself as a legislative 
initiative. True, during voting the third paragraph -- on 
accession to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons of 1 July 1968 -- got unexpectedly dropped: Someone 
remembered that deputies had not actually seen the document 
themselves, which was inconvenient.... Therefore Ukraine has not 
subscribed to it, although it now wished to!

  [Text] The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet today ratified the 
START-I treaty leaving out all stipulations regarding guarantees 
of the republic's security that it introduced during the 
consideration of the issue on November 18, 1993. A resolution 
made today instructs the government to carry out the exchange of 
ratification letters to the treaty. 
  The stipulations related to guarantees of Ukraine's 
territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and protection 
from aggression by nuclear states as well as compensations for 
Ukrainian nuclear warheads withdrawn from the republic. 
  At present, the stipulations are lifted since the deputies 
believe that Kiev's conditions have been met. 
  The resolution was passed by a majority of 260 votes, with 3 
votes against. Five deputies abstained and 21 failed to take 
part in the voting. 
  The parliament also decided to join the Lisbon protocol to 
the START-I treaty, including article 5. According to the 
article, Ukraine will join the nonproliferation treaty as a 
non-nuclear state in the near future. However, the parliament 
rejected the proposal to immediately join the treaty. 
  A total of 193 deputies voted for joining the treaty, 27 
against. Eleven deputies abstained and 58 failed to take part in 
the voting. 
  Speaking before the session, Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk said that the republic will necessarily receive the 
compensation for the nuclear weapons destroyed. He said 
Ukrainian, Russian and American experts will start work on 
determining the size of the compensation in February. 
  "If only one of the sides fails to fulfil its obligations, 
Ukraine will suspend the activities on its part," Kravchuk said, 
meaning the withdrawal of warheads of strategic nuclear missiles.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Kiev UNIAR in Ukrainian at 1730 GMT on 3 
February carries a 350-word Ukraine Supreme Council resolution 
on the START I Treaty as follows: 
  "The Supreme Council of Ukraine has resolved:" 
  "1. Taking into account the specific measures taken by the 
president and Government of Ukraine regarding the implementation 
of the provisions of the Supreme Council resolution dated 18 
November 1993, and the steps to meet Ukraine half-way on the 
part of the United States and Russia, in order to remove the 
reservations regarding the article of the Protocol to the START 
Treaty signed in Lisbon on 23 May 1992." 
  "2. To charge the Government of Ukraine with carrying out 
the exchange of instruments of ratification of the START Treaty." 
  "3. To accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty dated 
1 July 1968, which will hereafter be termed the Treaty, as a 
state not owning nuclear weapons, with the following statement:" 
  "1) Ukraine owns the components of the nuclear weapons that 
it inherited from the former USSR, and after the weapons have 
been dismantled and destroyed under its control, and in 
accordance with procedures that will rule out the possibility of 
reusing these weapons' components for the original purpose, 
Ukraine intends to use the material extracted from them 
exclusively for civilian purposes, in particular as fuel for 
Ukrainian AES [nuclear electric power station], or receive 
compensation for them;" 
  "2) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] does not 
fully 
cover the unique situation that arose as a result of the 
disintegration of the USSR as a nuclear state. The presence of 
nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine until they are 
eliminated entirely, as well as appropriate activity to 
maintain, service, and eliminate them, does not contravene the 
provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty." 
  "3) Ukraine will hold talks with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency with the aim of concluding agreements regarding 
the guarantees envisaged by the Treaty." 
  "4) The violation of the territorial integrity or 
inviolability of Ukraine's borders on the part of any nuclear 
state will be viewed by Ukraine as a violation of the Treaty." 
  Kiev UNIAR in Ukrainian at 1900 GMT on 3 February then 
carried the following service message: 
  "The news agency RESPUBLIKA [UNIAR] apologizes for the 
incorrect information about the approval by the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council of the resolution on the fulfilment by Ukraine's 
president of the Supreme Council of Ukraine recommendations made 
during the ratification of the START I Treaty. The Supreme 
Council approved a resolution of two items:" 
  "1. Taking into account the specific measures taken by the 
president and Government of Ukraine regarding the implementation 
of the provisions of the Supreme Council resolution dated 18 
November 1993, and the steps to meet Ukraine half-way on the 
part of the United States and Russia, in order to remove the 
reservations regarding article of the Protocol to the START 
Treaty signed in Lisbon on 23 May 1992." 
  "2. To charge the Government of Ukraine with carrying out 
the exchange of instruments of ratification of the START Treaty. 
With this aim to step up the activity of the Government on 
concluding specific international agreements stemming from the 
reservations of the Supreme Council resolution on the 
ratification of the START I Treaty." 
  "Item 3 on Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty was excluded from the resolution due to 
the fact that it was not discussed in Parliament. Deputy Sergey 
Golovatyy made a remark to the effect that Ukraine could not 
announce itself simultaneously a nuclear state while acceding to 
START I and a non-nuclear state while participating in the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Issues of compensation for 
the nuclear weapon components were touched upon with regard to 
the difference in prices for the fuel uranium on the U.S. 
internal and external market, etc. Deputies Sergey Golovatyy, 
Tetyana Yakheyeva, and Sergey Semenets proposed to discuss this 
in the standing commissions, and to then submit it for the 
consideration of the Supreme Council. After this the issue on 
accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will be 
solved."

  [Text] If the Ukrainian parliament refuses to join the 
treaty on nonproliferation of nuclear weapons [NPT], this may 
lead to a conflict between the republic's legislative and 
executive branches of power. This was said to Interfax by a 
high-ranking official from the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. 
  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk called upon the 
parliament to ratify the START I and to sign the treaty on 
nonproliferation on January 24. 
  According to the diplomat, the parliament's plenary session 
may finish on Monday with no decision made on the president's 
proposal. This will mean that the settlement of the issue will 
be deferred for an undetermined period of time. 
  "The Russian president suspended the Supreme Soviet's powers 
and assumed its authority for the period of transition," the 
diplomat remarked. "However, the Ukrainian constitution does not 
mention the right of the president to sign documents on joining 
international treaties in the period of parliamentary 
elections," he emphasized. 
  Deputy Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris Tarasuk said that 
the 
withdrawal of nuclear military charge from Ukrainian territory 
would continue until the guaranteed terms for their utilization 
expired.

  [Text] Kiev, 4 Feb -- Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko spoke at a news conference in the Foreign 
Affairs Ministry on the attitude of the world community to the 
trilateral agreement on nuclear disarmament signed in Moscow. 
This attitude, he said, was absolutely positive, showing the 
world community's appreciation of the historic step taken by 
Ukraine. The minister noted that the resolution adopted by the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine yesterday [3 February] was especially 
significant, in that the Supreme Council appreciated the steps 
made by the president and the government to follow the Supreme 
Council's recommendations contained in the 18 November 1993 
resolution. 
  "It is worth stressing," Anatoliy Zlenko said, "that the 
Supreme Council, having withdrawn its reservations on Article 5 
of the Lisbon Protocol, thus confirmed Ukraine's intention to 
join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as soon as 
possible, as a state that does not possess nuclear arms. This 
way, failure to take a decision on joining the NPT in 
[yesterday's] resolution should not be regarded as the Supreme 
Council's negative stand on the treaty, but only as the Supreme 
Council's intention to examine this issue at a separate Supreme 
Council session." 
  The minister then said that the Supreme Council's decision 
clears the way for exchanging instruments of ratification and 
thus completing the process of the ratification of the START 
Treaty. 
  Anatoliy Zlenko told journalists that bilateral and 
trilateral talks between experts will be held in the near future 
with regard to the practical implementation of the principles 
laid down in the trilateral statement and its appendix signed on 
14 January in Moscow. In the minister's view, the Supreme 
Council's decision makes it possible to speed up talks with 
international financial organizations, the European Union, and 
the leading Western states on the granting of effective aid to 
Ukraine for its economic reform. 
  In reply to journalists' questions, the foreign minister 
said 
that only three nuclear warheads had been transferred from 
Ukraine to Russia so far, due to their unsatisfactory technical 
condition.

  [Excerpts] Kiev , 4 Feb -- At a news conference on 4 
February, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and Boris 
Tarasyuk, his deputy, discussed the Ukrainian parliament's 
approval of the trilateral statement by the Presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on Ukraine's nuclear 
disarmament. [passage omitted] 
  Anatoliy Zlenko said that Ukraine expects $4 billion worth 
of 
aid as a result of its disarmament. As regards nuclear arms 
withdrawal which, according to Ukrainian People's Deputy 
Valentin Lemish, seems to have started already, Tarasyuk said: 
"I declare with all due responsibility that no warhead has 
crossed the borders of Ukraine as yet. Indeed, three warheads 
have been transferred to Russia for dismantling, but only 
because of their disastrous condition and in response to 
experts' demands."

  [Text] Russia hopes that the talks on the nuclear problem 
to begin in Kiev on Tuesday will clarify all issues pertaining 
to nuclear weapons, leader of the Russian delegation Yuriy 
Dubinin told Interfax. 
  He believes that the Ukrainian parliament's resolution on 
the 
ratification of the START-I treaty, passed on February 4, 1994, 
has many "ambiguous places." It does not say, for instance, 
what percentage of nuclear weapons is to be eliminated. 
  Dubinin said that on November 18, 1993, the Ukrainian 
parliament passed the resolution on the ratification of the 
START-I treaty, according to which only 36% of the 
Ukrainian 
missiles and 42% of the warheads were to be eliminated. 
"This 
goes against both the START-I treaty and the Lisbon agreements. 
It's still unclear whether Ukraine intends to eliminate 
100% 
of the nuclear weapons located on its territory in strict 
accordance with the START-I treaty and the Lisbon protocol," he 
said. 
  According to Dubinin, neither is it clear whether Ukraine 
will join the nonproliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state. 
  Speaking about Ukraine's participation in NATO's Partnership 
for Peace program, he said that Russia is approaching this issue 
calmly. "Russia has already supported the partnership concept. 
Why should Ukraine not join it?" he said. 
<H3>  ...AND UKRAINE WILL SOON JOIN NONPROLIFERATION TREATY, 
AMBASSADOR SAYS </H3>
  Ukraine will be a non-nuclear state and will "shortly" join 
the Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968, the Ukrainian ambassador to 
Russia said. 
  Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy told a news conference in Moscow on 
Monday that the Ukrainian parliament had now approved all the 
points of Article Five of the Lisbon Protocol. "This eliminates 
the main problem, and now everything is ready for joining the 
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the 
immediate future," he said. All nuclear arms will be removed 
from Ukraine, he said. 
  Kryzhanovskiy said the Ukrainian legislature had charged the 
government with the exchanging of the START-I ratification 
instruments and instructed it to take more efforts to enter into 
relevant international agreements. 
  The ambassador did not rule out that Ukraine's membership in 
the Nonproliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state would be 
approved by the present parliament, but said this was most 
likely to be done by the next legislature, to be elected on 
March 27. 
  Commenting on Ukraine's relations with Russia, Kryzhanovskiy 
said there was some friction but that it had set off no 
conflicts between the two nations. As for the idea of the 
incorporation of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea 
into Russia through a Crimean referendum, he said it would be 
the same as the incorporation of Russia's Kuril Islands into 
Japan on the basis of the results of a referendum by the Kurile 
population. "That's not serious," he said. 
  He said none of the former Soviet republics, including 
Russia, "has given a kopeck" to return Crimean Tatars to Crimea.

  [Text] Chairman of the Ukrainian parliament's Commission on 
Legislation and Law, a leader of the Ukrainian Communist Party, 
Aleksandr Kotsuba, doubted that the ratification of the Moscow 
statement of the three presidents (U.S.A., Russia and Ukraine -- 
IF) could "guarantee the total security of Ukraine." 
  He said in an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine that it was 
necessary to consider some provisions of the trilateral 
statement in the parliament. In his words, it was hard to 
understand "why primarily the SS-24 missiles controlled by us 
must be withdrawn from Ukrainian territory and not the obsolete 
SS-19 which we do not control and cannot launch." 
  In his opinion, "it was necessary to demand the 
states-parties to the Helsinki, Paris, Vienna and Lisbon 
agreements and the UN member-states to participate in the 
agreement of the three presidents. It is necessary that not 
only Ukraine give up its missiles but that the other parties 
also reduce their numbers," Kotsuba pointed out.

<F P=106> [Report by N. Vasylyuk: "Moscow Statement Is a Compromise" </F>
-- first paragraph is KYYIVSKA PRAVDA introduction published in 
boldface] 
  [Text] Last weeks' equivocal events in the life of 
Ukraine's foreign policy have elicited many doubts, 
controversies, and hopes. It is hard to comprehend all the 
subtleties of politics and understand the official position of 
Kiev regarding these events without comments by a government 
official or diplomat. This fact prompted a meeting between 
Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk and journalists. The 
conversation went beyond the protocol, and therefore, responding 
to numerous questions, Mr. Tarasyuk briefed us about: 
<H3>  ...The Meeting Between the Ukrainian and Kazakhstani 
Presidents </H3>
  Unfortunately, due to the intensity of the latest events, 
the 
first official visit to Ukraine by Kazakhstani President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev went almost unnoticed. This was a very 
important event, since the visit become the first step toward 
rapprochement of both presidents' positions on cooperation 
between Ukraine and Kazakhstan in the framework of the CIS and 
beyond this structure. It is not a secret that Leonid Kravchuk 
and Nursultan Nazarbayev had differing viewpoints on an economic 
union among former USSR republics and the CIS in general. After 
the visit, the emphasis will apparently be placed on bilateral 
relations. 
  It is hard not to appreciate future cooperation between 
Ukraine, one of the key countries in Central-Eastern Europe, and 
Kazakhstan, a leading state in Central Eurasia. 
  Borys Tarasyuk emphasized that this visit initiated a new 
stage in Ukrainian-Kazakhstani relations. The presidents signed 
a new interstate agreement. A declaration signed by the two 
presidents became a milestone for bilateral relations between 
our countries. The declaration emphasizes, in particular, the 
necessity of establishing a universal interregional security 
system "from Vancouver to Vladivostok," which would include all 
countries without exception, as well as preventing the 
establishment of new blocs on the territory of new independent 
states which have ended up in a "security vacuum." 
  The presidents reached an agreement as to concrete fields of 
cooperation such as, for example, space exploration. Although 
Ukraine's contribution to the development of space exploration 
amounted to 40 percent of the total share during the USSR era, 
the country does not have capabilities of using such a great 
potential. Kazakhstan possesses testing ranges and launching 
facilities. 
<H3>  ...The Tripartite Statement [as published] by the Ukrainian, 
U.S., and Russian Presidents Signed in Moscow on 14 January </H3>
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine is convinced that 
the signing of the statement conforms to the vital interests of 
Ukraine. Regarding the compensation for nuclear weapons, the 
statement envisions such compensation for Kazakhstan, Belarus, 
and Ukraine in exchange for highly enriched uranium from nuclear 
warheads. 
  The statement is not an international agreement and it must 
be ratified by the legislatures of the three countries. 
Although it is important to know what is the attitude of the 
Ukrainian legislature toward the statement, this document acts 
as a response to the reservations expressed by the Ukrainian 
legislature toward the signing of the agreement on nuclear 
weapons. The Moscow statement was signed by the presidents of 
three states, and this fact put it beyond the framework of a 
political statement, said Mr. Tarasyuk. It provides for concrete 
actions. Each one of the three states made certain concessions. 
This is a compromise among the three presidents. Ukraine 
obtained a response to the question concerning security 
guarantees, material and technical assistance in disarmament, 
and compensation. The participants in the negotiations reached 
an accord that, in case Ukraine signs documents on nuclear 
weapons, a multilateral document will be signed -- Great Britain 
also is willing to sign such a document. 
  What is the deadline for dismantling nuclear weapons 
deployed 
in Ukraine? This is a technical condition of nuclear warheads. 
The predetermined shelf life of many nuclear warheads will 
expire as early as this year, and next year this process will 
have an avalanche effect. 
<H5>  ...The Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet </H5>
  Asked by journalists whether the complex economic situation 
will lead to a partition of Ukraine into separate territories, 
particularly with regard to the Crimea, Borys Tarasyuk replied 
that the international community, including Russia, recognized 
Ukraine as an independent state with defined borders in 1991. 
The UN Security Council recognized as groundless the 9 July 
statement issued by the Russian legislature on the status of 
Sevastopol. The tripartite statement signed by the Ukrainian, 
U.S., and Russian presidents says that the United States and 
Russia respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and existing 
borders. 
  Speaking about the prospects for the withdrawal of the 
Russian part of the Black Sea Fleet from Ukraine, the Ukrainian 
Deputy Foreign Minister stated that the Black Sea Fleet, de 
jure, remains under the authority of the Ukrainian and Russian 
presidents. The political atmosphere between our countries has 
improved, following the Moscow summit. There are certain 
grounds to expect that the Black Sea Fleet issue will be 
resolved already this year. 
  Certain political leaders of the Crimea, noted Mr. Tarasyuk, 
were looking for Russia's support. Nevertheless, we do not have 
any evidence to claim that Russia's Government rendered any help 
to political forces in the Crimea. 
  The issue of leasing by Russia certain onshore facilities 
located on Ukrainian territory still remains on the agenda. 
However, this does not concern the city of Sevastopol but only 
several facilities. 
<H3>  ...The Nonbloc Status Proclaimed by Ukraine and Perspectives 
for Cooperation With NATO </H3>
  Ukraine announced its nonbloc status in the 1990 declaration 
on state sovereignty. Since then, the geopolitical situation 
has changed. Although the Warsaw Pact does not exist, there 
still is NATO, and new military-political alliances have 
appeared on Asian territories. Given these circumstances, 
Ukraine could end up between two military blocs. Today, we 
remain in the so-called "security vacuum." Cooperation with 
NATO, CSCE, and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, does not 
contradict our main goals. 
  The authors of the U.S. initiative "Partnership for Peace" 
believe that such cooperation does not mean membership in NATO 
but rather bilateral cooperation. Security guarantees, 
essential for every country, should include our own armed 
forces, cooperation with neighboring states, and participation 
in international security systems or military-political 
organizations. 
  Providing these explanations, Borys Tarasyuk recalled 
consultations with government experts from all East and Central 
European countries conducted at a meeting devoted to 
establishing a security system, which was held in Pushcha-Ozerna 
in the vicinity of Kiev. The experts met to find ways of 
implementing Leonid Kravchuk's initiative for establishing a 
stability zone in Central-Eastern Europe and the U.S. initiative 
"Partnership for Peace." The main goal of the consultations was 
the rapprochement of positions, searching for compromises and 
common approaches to security issues. There will be another 
round of such consultations, which are eventually aimed at 
signing a multilateral agreement on the security system in 
Central and Eastern Europe. In the best case, noted Borys 
Tarasyuk, such an agreement should be signed already this year.

<F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Smetanin: "Ukrainian Rocket Troops Want </F>
Transfers to Russia"] 
  [Text] Prompted by the agreement on scrapping Ukrainian 
nuclear weapons signed by the three presidents [of Ukraine, 
Russia, and the United States], foreign media -- Russian among 
them -- have launched another spiral of speculations on this 
issue. In particular, the "Radio-ROX" station and IZVESTIYA 
reported that several dozen officers from a rocket division 
stationed in the town of Pervomaysk, concerned about their fate, 
allegedly applied for transfers to the Russian rocket forces. 
  Although our Russian colleagues could not be rebuked for 
being incorrect, the timing of their report deserves closer 
attention. What they tried to pitch as a sensation is actually a 
commonplace event in the Army's everyday life. We should rather 
listen to the opinion of a man who knows everything about this 
problem and who heard nothing about the dozens of reports. Here 
is what Lieutenant General Aleksey Kryzhko, head of the 
Administration Center of the Ukrainian Nuclear Forces, told us. 
  Facts reported by the radio station and newspaper are in 
fact 
part of the implementation of agreements reached by the 
Ukrainian and Russian Defense Ministries back in 1992. 
According those agreements, we are to facilitate in all 
possible ways the movement of servicemen from Strategic Rocket 
Forces -- both to Ukraine and from Ukraine. This is a natural 
process caused by many reasons which are different in each 
individual case. We cannot stand in the way of people's wishes. 
Last year, more than 300 servicemen came to Ukraine from 
Russia, and there were at least as many that we peacefully sent 
to our neighbors. 
  Let me repeat that all these actions are agreed-upon by 
personnel departments of our ministries and raise no particular 
concerns on the part of either side. Your wrote that some 50 
rocket servicemen suddenly applied for a transfer. I would have 
known about this in the first place, and IZVESTIYA should have 
turned directly to the primary source of information. As it is, 
they offered only part of the truth, making a "sensation" out of 
it. 
  It was hard not to agree with Aleksey Kryzhko that any kind 
of information is more valuable when obtained from competent 
officials. But one more thing is also clear -- if our state is 
not capable of ensuring decent standards for officers of the 
43th Rocket Army, which is destined to cease its existence, we 
will definitely have to grapple with the problem of who is 
supposed to take the rockets off combat readiness, drain the 
fuel, dismantle main components, perform a partial 
neutralization of the rockets, send them for recycling... The 
information disseminated by IZVESTIYA and "Radio-ROX" about 
officers starting to write reports requesting transfers should 
give our leadership a lot of food for thought. If we do not 
immediately address this problem -- after all, it is always the 
best people who leave -- will we be able to fulfill obligations 
assumed under agreements and destroy nuclear weapons without 
damaging society and the environment. However, this is a topic 
for a separate discussion, and we will definitely return to it.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Kostenko, Ukraine's people's deputy, head </F>
of the deputies working group for nuclear disarmament issues, 
and minister of environmental protection: "`General Atomics' Is 
Precisely What Ukraine Urgently Needs"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  At the Request of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA, a True Specialist Shows 
How To Make Proper Calculations With Pencil in Hand </H3>
  1. Among the possible variants for utilizing the 
highly-enriched uranium removed from nuclear warheads, the 
proposal by the American "General Atomics" company was the most 
acceptable. The contract provided for creating in Ukraine a 
joint enterprise to process highly-enriched uranium and 
transform it into nuclear fuel for atomic electric power plants 
[AES's]. 
  The following are the advantages of this variant: 
  -- no expenditure associated with the transportation of 
highly-enriched uranium; 
  -- with the help of contemporary ecologically safe 
technologies, highly-enriched uranium may be effectively 
transformed into fuel; 
  -- conditions are created for Ukraine to earn hard currency 
rapidly; 
  -- Ukraine's long-term technological cooperation with the 
world's advanced companies in the sphere of nuclear power 
engineering. 
  An enterprise, more specifically a small production unit, 
may 
be built within one or two years. The cost of the construction 
is $30 million. After the fulfillment of the program for 
processing the highly-enriched uranium, the production may be 
reprofiled for the needs of Ukraine's nuclear-fuel cycle. 
  2. The transfer of nuclear warheads to Russia is stipulated 
by interstate documents "The Main Principles of the Utilization 
of Nuclear Charges of the Strategic Nuclear Forces Deployed in 
Ukraine" and "The Agreement Between the Ukrainian Government and 
the Government of the Russian Federation on the Utilization of 
Nuclear Warheads," which were signed on 3 September 1993 in 
Massandra [in the Crimea] during the meetings of presidents L.M. 
Kravchuk and B.N. Yeltsin. In accordance with the clauses of 
the aforementioned agreements, Ukraine committed itself to 
transferring to Russia all types of nuclear warheads of 
intercontinental nuclear missiles and air-launched cruise 
missiles for them to be dismantled and utilized. 
  No other possible variants of dismantling nuclear warheads 
were considered. 
  3. On the world market, the price of nuclear fuel, which is 
supplied in accordance with long-term contracts, amounts to 
between $1,000 and $1,400 per kilogram. One-time agreements on 
fuel supply are somewhat cheaper -- between $600 and $700 per 
kilogram. 
  Ukraine receives all its fuel for atomic plants from Russian 
enterprises at prices close to world prices. However, practice 
shows that the majority of world countries with nuclear power 
engineering have their own enterprises that manufacture fuel 
cartridges because it is economically rational. Ukraine has 
large deposits of uranium ore and some functioning enterprises 
of the nuclear-fuel cycle -- the enrichment of crude uranium, 
production of zirconium for heat-generating elements, absorbing 
materials, and so on. That is why it would be much more 
profitable for Ukraine to manufacture our own fuel cartridges 
than to purchase them from Russia. The cost of constructing 
such an enterprise is about $500 million; it could be built 
within two or three years; in the conditions prevailing in 
Ukraine, the period of recoupment would be three years. 
  4. If we proceed from the assumption that capacities for the 
production of nuclear fuel are created in Ukraine, something 
upon which Ukrainian nuclear specialists and scientists insist, 
then it is most expedient to use nuclear materials from the 
warheads for the needs of our own power engineering. 
  If nuclear warheads are transferred to Russia, it is much 
more profitable for Ukraine to receive compensation for the 
nuclear materials, and not compensation in the form of nuclear 
fuel. For example, in accordance with some estimates, the cost 
of highly-enriched uranium is 100 times that of the price of 
low-grade uranium contained in the fuel cartridge, and 
weapons-grade plutonium costs between five and 10 times that of 
the highly-enriched uranium. That is why Ukraine is entitled to 
compensation of $10 billion for the nuclear materials from 
tactical weapons alone. The cost of all those fuel cartridges, 
which Russia promises to supply in exchange for Ukraine's 
nuclear weapons will only constitute between $1 billion and $2 
billion. 
  5. The problem here lies not so much in the inability of 
scientific collectives as in the absence of desire on the part 
of our leadership to do something. 
  6. In accordance with Ukraine's Supreme Council decree "On 
Additional Measures for Ensuring Ukraine's Nonnuclear Status," 
which was adopted in April 1992, the government had to take 
urgent measures to establish effective technological control 
over the nonuse of the nuclear weapons located on the territory 
of Ukraine. It was planned to have this work fulfilled by one of 
the Kharkiv Institutes which developed practically all systems 
of control over the former USSR's strategic offensive weapons. 
  The Supreme Council's decisions have not been fulfilled to 
this day and, for that reason, it is, probably, appropriate to 
speak about seven to 10 years, in order not to do anything at 
all. 
  Partnership for Peace is the attempt, on the part of the 
United States, without entering into a conflict with Russia, to 
fill in that vacuum of security that resulted from the 
disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the USSR. However, in 
conditions of political instability and expansion of the 
revanchist moods in Russia, the West's indecisiveness in 
creating effective security systems in Europe may lead to yet 
another redivision of the spheres of influence and to a 
restoration of Russian hegemony within the CIS or Eastern Europe.

<F P=106> [Konstantin Parishkura report from Kiev under the "SALT" </F>
rubric: "Ukrainian Parliament Concerned Over Compensation for 
Nuclear Bomb. Defense Minister Warns About Possible Catastrophe"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the Ukrainian Supreme Council tasked the 
Council of Ministers with "stepping up efforts" to sign specific 
treaties on compensation for the nuclear weapons to be removed 
from Ukraine. As for Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, it was decided to consider the question 
at a separate Supreme Council meeting. Foreign Minister 
Anatoliy Zlenko said that "Ukraine has considerably tarnished 
its image as an international partner by reneging on its 
promises." Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskiy sweetened the 
pill by saying that Ukraine is a powerful space state that will 
in time be capable of manufacturing delivery vehicles and 
weapons on its own. But later he said that the storage time of 
the combat nuclear blocs, where uncontrollable physical 
processes may begin, is drawing to an end and that "the 
Chernobyl catastrophe would pale beside what might happen." 
  Mr. Kravchuk, on his part, said that he received a telegram 
from U.S. President Clinton on 3 February saying that the United 
States plans to double its aid for dismantling nuclear weapons 
in Ukraine.

Shmarov by Olena Lisychna; place and date not given: "Ukraine's 
Last Nuclear Season" -- first two paragraphs are UKRAYINA MOLODA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who headed 
Ukraine's delegation to negotiations in Washington on the eve of 
the Moscow meeting, has indeed become a hero of Ukraine's last 
"nuclear" season. 
  For a while, the legislature has put aside discussion of the 
"nuclear" agreement. If the Supreme Council does not support 
the Moscow agreement, Ukraine will experience "hard days," 
claims Valeriy Shamarov. At the same time, Valeriy Shamarov 
does not support illusions that Ukraine will receive weighty 
credits and investments. However, he believes that even "small 
sums are better than nothing." 
  Lisychna: This "nuclear" history still has many 
white spots, and the issue of compensation for our tactical 
nuclear weapons is of extreme interest. 
  Shmarov: Indeed, for quite a long time, Russia did 
not agree to our demands for compensation. However, at the last 
stage of the negotiations, Russia recognized our ownership of 
the tactical nuclear weapons and we discussed, in general, forms 
of holding our mutual accounts. We will cancel part of our 
debts for energy resources by transferring these tactical 
nuclear weapons to Russia. In the first place, in my opinion, 
this is better than nothing. In the second place, Ukraine 
cannot enjoy equal partnership because it has amassed enormous 
debts to Russia. 
  Lisychna: Valeriy Mykolayovych, what part of our 
debt could be canceled? 
  Shmarov: The more the better. I estimate our 1993 
debts to Russia at $1 billion, while 1992 debts -- at $2.5 
billion. In my opinion, we could settle 50 percent of our 1993 
debts. 
  Well, the issue of strategic nuclear weapons is also very 
complicated. Economic calculations were based on data drawn 
from the worldwide uranium trade. The U.S. side will be a 
guarantor of the fulfillment of this agreement by the Russian 
party. A tripartite commission will draft the contract on this 
agreement in three-months time. 
  Lisychna: Who will pay for the processing of 
uranium in Russia? 
  Shmarov: This expense is included in the costs of 
Ukrainian deliveries to Russia. One more positive moment for 
Russia: Russia will be paid by the United States for each 
weapon dismantled on the territory of Ukraine. 
  Lisychna: Is this payment for work or a kind of 
moral support? 
  Shmarov: This moral support means big money. In 
general, the United States is deeply interested in the 
dismantlement of nuclear weapons because the missiles are still 
directed at the United States, despite the fact that the button 
is in Moscow. 
  Lisychna: For how long can our nuclear power 
plants work on the fuel which we are going to receive from 
Russia as part of our compensation? 
  Shmarov: Yearly, we require 100 tonnes of nuclear 
fuel. Currently, we are short of nuclear fuel. Our nuclear 
power plants could work for five to seven years on the fuel 
which will be delivered under the Moscow agreement. 
  Lisychna: Our legislature must adopt the START I 
and START II Treaties and Ukraine should sign the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty before the Moscow agreements can start 
being implemented.... 
  Shmarov: If these agreements are not implemented, 
Ukraine will experience hard times. We have held a series of 
consultations in the Supreme Council. The deputies understand 
the importance of these agreements. In addition, after the 
Supreme Council says "yes" or "no," we will have to draft nine 
agreements on compensation issues. I hope that the Supreme 
Council's decision on the issue will be positive. 
  Lisychna: On 25 January, IZVESTIYA published this 
report: "The second Chernobyl is under way. The dismantlement 
of old missiles in Ukraine has been stopped for an indefinite 
period due to the lack of military storage bases, transport, and 
material assets." Is this report true? 
  Shmarov: These facts are partially true. 
Currently, we lack containers and means of transport. However, 
the Moscow agreements foresee that Russia will provide us with 
equipment and means of transportation.... The Russian Defense 
Ministry will deliver everything on time.... In general, our 
agreement with Russia is based on mutual relations: We also 
deal with servicing of nuclear-armed SS-24 rocket launchers in 
Russia because they were produced in Ukraine. 
  Lisychna: Valeriy Mykolayovych, what about the sum 
of $2.8 billion? In late 1993, Ukraine demanded that this sum 
be earmarked for the dismantlement of its nuclear weapons. 
However, it turned out that this figure was also false. So, 
what sum does Ukraine currently require? 
  Shmarov: The figure of $2.8 billion is likely to 
be too big. In my opinion, we require more than $175 million or 
even $1.75 billion. Well, concerning the so-called U.S. 
financial aid, I insisted (even during my stay in Washington) 
that the United States should increase its aid within the 
framework of the Nunn-Lugar program. The U.S. side has promised 
this. It is more important for us to not receive consultations 
(we have our own experts) or a system of satellite 
communications, but modern equipment, diesel fuel, assets for 
social protection of servicemen, etc.... Or, simply put, our 
requirements are more practical. 
  Lisychna: Bill Clinton said at the Boryspil 
airport that Ukraine can use funds from the Nunn-Lugar program 
for purposes of conversion and defense.... 
  Shmarov: These means are miserable. As for 
conversion, we have signed an agreement between the Pentagon and 
the Ukrainian Ministry of Machine Building on the issue of 
cooperation in the sphere of conversion. This could be one more 
source of financial resources because we could draft projects in 
which Americans could become interested. 
  One more positive element of the Moscow agreement is the 
extension of our relations. Currently, our government 
delegation is working in the United States. Our economic 
cooperation with the United States currently stands at $500 
million. 
  Lisychna: Valeriy Mykolayovych, how can you 
predict that investments and credits will flow to a 
denuclearized Ukraine? Our economic reforms are at a standstill. 
  Shmarov: This is a difficult question. U.S. 
business circles are dissatisfied with the course of reforms in 
Ukraine. However, they consider our issue of denuclearization 
to be of key importance, and the issue of economic reforms is of 
secondary interest to them. 
  In my opinion, the United States will not force us with the 
implementation of these reforms. Though, some people think this 
way.

  In compliance with the treaty on conventional armed forces 
in 
Europe, Ukraine continues to reduce its conventional armaments. 
Since the beginning of this year, four international inspection 
groups have already visited our state. They familiarized 
themselves with the practical implementation of the treaty 
provisions. They visited the Lvov, Nikolayev, Kiev, and 
Zhitomir armored vehicle repair plants. In the near future, 100 
tanks and 60 armored fighting vehicles will be liquidated at 
these enterprises.

is the result of the first stage of reductions completed by the 
Ukrainian Army in accordance with the agreement on Conventional

Nikolayev, Kiev, and Zhytomyr armor plants, at which 100 tanks 
and 60 armored combat vehicles will be eliminated in the very 
near future. Altogether, during this new stage of reductions, 
more than 600 tanks and more than 300 armored combat vehicles 
will have to be destroyed.

Building, Although It Is Possible To Make Use of the Scrap"] 
  [Text] Despite the image Ukraine has acquired as an 
unpredictable state because of its nuclear missiles, it is 
precisely Ukraine that strictly adheres to the agreement on the 
Reduction of Conventional Weapons in Europe. The photograph 
below shows how MiG-21's and MiG-23's are being destroyed. In 
accordance with the agreement, the destruction of the technology 
must be completed within three years, although 115 aircraft have 
already been eliminated. One circumstance is alarming: Since 
the technology is being dismantled at military units, what 
control over its utilization can one talk about? It is a pity. 
We have repeatedly witnessed how numerous commercial 
structures, which took advantage of the alleged secrecy of the 
operations, made good profits even on this valuable metal scrap. 
They turned over very small amounts of it, if at all, to the 
state treasury. What is going to happen now?

  [Text] Kiev, 8 Feb -- "Officials from Ukraine's leadership 
circles have falsified the Ukrainian Supreme Council's 
resolution of 3 February 1994 [ratifying the START I Treaty]," 
People's Deputy Serhiy Holovatyy claims. 
  During the debate on a draft resolution on the trilateral 
statement by the Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian presidents, Deputy 
Serhiy Holovatyy put forward an amendment to Paragraph 2, as 
follows: "To this end (in order to exchange ratification 
certificates), government activity should be stepped up to 
conclude specific international agreements that follow from the 
reservations in the Supreme Council's resolution on the 
ratification of the START I Treaty [the resolution now in 
question is that of 18 November 1993]." 
  This version of the resolution was approved by the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine. In the official text of the resolution, 
however, a different version of Paragraph 2 was presented. 
Namely, the words "to this end" were excluded. Thus, the 
contents of the Supreme Council's decision on this issue were 
essentially altered. The text of Paragraph 2 in its amended 
version makes provision for the following sequence of the 
Ukrainian Government's actions relating to the START I Treaty: 
First, concluding international agreements that proceed from 
the Supreme Council resolution and, in particular on granting 
Ukraine security guarantees, followed by an exchange of 
ratification certificates. 
  Such a sequence does not exist in the falsified text and 
this 
is why Mr. Holovatyy considers that it was stated that Ukraine 
lifted all reservations relating to the START I Treaty, also 
including security guarantees. In fact, this does conform with 
reality.

  [Excerpts] Officials from Ukraine's leadership circles have 
falsified the Ukrainian Supreme Council's resolution of 3 
February 1994 [ratifying the START I Treaty]. This was a 
statement made by People's Deputy of Ukraine Serhiy Holovatyy at 
a news conference held in Kiev. [passage omitted] 
  [Holovatyy] My opinion is that officials from Ukraine's 
leadership circles have falsified the Ukrainian Supreme 
Council's resolution of 3 February 1994 [ratifying the START I 
Treaty]. These actions fall within those provided by the 
Criminal Code of Ukraine with regard to the crime under the name 
of falsification when in [civil] service. 
  The matter here is this. The initial version of Paragraph 2 
of the draft of this resolution submitted by the Ukrainian 
president, was as follows: The Government of Ukraine will be 
instructed to exchange the ratification certificates relating to 
the START Treaty. 
  During the discussion of this paragraph, I put forward an 
amendment, the essence of which was as follows: The sentence in 
the president's draft is to be augmented as follows: And to 
this end the government will step up its activity to conclude 
specific international agreements that follow from the 
reservations in the Supreme Council's resolution on the 
ratification of the START I Treaty [the resolution in question 
now is the original one of 18 November 1993]. 
  The second paragraph of the resolution, with my amendment in 
it, was put to the vote and adopted. 
  However, the official text of the Supreme Council's 
resolution, printed in government newspapers, offers a different 
version. It reads as follows: The Government of Ukraine will 
be instructed to exchange the certificates on the ratification 
of the START Treaty and will step up its activity to conclude 
specific international agreements that follow from the 
reservations in the Ukrainian Supreme Council's resolution on 
the ratification of the START I Treaty. 
  The words -- to this end -- have been excluded from my 
amendment. I regard this as a correction that has essentially 
altered the text of the decision, rather than linguistically 
correcting or editing it. This is because the three words -- to 
this end -- and the sentence, or the decision, in Paragraph 2 
with these three words, envisage that the sequence of the 
government's actions relating to the START I will be as follows: 
First, concluding international agreements that follow from the 
resolution of 18 November [1993] -- when putting forward this 
amendment, in particular, I primarily had in mind security 
guarantees -- and then exchanging the ratification certificates. 
  The falsified text lacks this sequence. The conjunction -- 
and -- enabled the government to make a statement that Ukraine 
had lifted all reservations concerning the START I Treaty and, 
accordingly, security guarantees. So, I cannot interpret the 
lack of correspondence between the text of the shorthand record 
and the text of the official document published in the press, as 
anything other than a crime when in [public] service. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Own correspondent Boris Sverdlov report: "Ukraine: Deputy </F>
Khmara Does Not Want To Give Up the Nuclear Bomb"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- The election campaign is gathering momentum 
in Ukraine. An average of five or six candidates per Supreme 
Council seat has already been registered in many electoral 
districts. The leaders of parties and movements are not 
stinting on interviews in the mass media, are proposing various 
scenarios for emerging from economic collapse, and are analyzing 
the present blunders in detail. 
  But everyone is expressing his attitude toward the recent 
agreement on nuclear-free status for Ukraine. Some are 
unconditionally supporting L. Kravchuk, while others are 
accusing him of betraying national interests. 
  The latter people mostly represent national-radical parties. 
Judging by their speeches, you get the impression that they 
missed the press conference by the foreign minister and defense 
minister, which has been repeatedly shown on republic 
television. At the press conference the department heads 
explained in detail that implementation of the agreement 
entirely accords with the state's interests, that Russia and the 
United States have given Ukraine clear national security 
guarantees, and that machinery for immediate compensation for 
each nuclear missile that is removed has been enumerated. 
  A recent speech by Stepan Khmara stands out. Accusing the 
United States and Russia of imperial ways, he painted a black 
picture of the "humiliating agreement" signed by Leonid 
Kravchuk, who, according to him, should be immediately relieved 
of the presidency. He called on parliament to block the 
"adventure by the head of state." 
  At the present stage the sharp attacks by opponents of the 
agreement pursue a single aim -- to influence the course of 
parliament's discussion of nuclear status. 
  The "New Ukraine," Ukrainian Civic Congress, and Slavic 
Unity 
Party movements have spoken out against the wholesale criticism 
of the president.... 
  Former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma declared that in Ukraine 
there are many "patriotic" politicians who were at first all in 
favor of nuclear-free status, but now are campaigning equally 
insistently on the other side. When were they being sincere? 
  Nevertheless, most observers are hopefully awaiting the 
discussion of the agreement between the three presidents in the 
Supreme Council. In their view, only a positive result will 
enable the young state to strengthen its independence and 
stabilize the economy with the help of long-term large-scale 
credits.

  [Text] Chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council I. Plyushch 
has received Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the 
Argentinian Republic in Ukraine L. Baqueriza. A friendly 
conversation took place. The ambassador asked about the course 
of discussion by the Ukrainian parliament of the Tripartite 
Agreement signed by the presidents of Ukraine, the United 
States, and Russia and of the supplement on the elimination of 
nuclear weapons on the territory of our state. In the 
ambassador's opinion, these documents themselves and the 
decisions adopted by the Ukrainian parliament are historic. 
They, Baqueriza emphasized, have generated a lot of interest in 
Argentina. 
  Plyushch pointed out that we regard the Tripartite Statement 
and the supplement to it as a step of good will and as a step of 
good intentions on the part of Russia and the United States with 
regard to resolving this problem. All the more so since, in the 
course of preparing, signing, and adopting these documents, 
Ukrainian President L. Kravchuk acted decisively and correctly. 
  Touching upon bilateral Ukrainian-Argentinian ties, the two 
parties pointed out with satisfaction that the Argentinian 
president is expected to come to Ukraine on an official visit.

Defense and UKRINFORM: "Ukraine Does Not Trade in the Fleet"] 
  [Text] Some mass media have echoed the information carried 
by the Saudi Arabian newspaper ASH-SHARK AL-AUSAT [name as 
transliterated] about Ukraine's intention to sell "a 
considerable part of its share of the former Soviet naval fleet" 
to Persian Gulf countries. Referring to "sources in 
Washington," the newspaper maintains that rapid assault crafts, 
torpedo boats, destroyers, and minelayers are up for sale. Iran 
has allegedly been offered a submarine. 
  This is obvious misinformation aimed at undermining 
Ukraine's 
prestige and compromising it in the eyes of the world community. 
As of today, Ukraine does not own any part of the former USSR's 
naval fleet, and, therefore, there can be no talk of it selling 
warships.

Operational Administration chief of staff, by Mariya Bazelyuk;

  [Text] Bazelyuk: What role do you think the 
Ukrainian Officers' Association [SOU] should play in building 
the state? 
  Rol: The association's chief goal is to promote 
consolidation of the Armed Forces and therefore strengthen the 
Ukrainian state, because the Army is one of the fundamental 
institutions of its protection. As everyone knows, the SOU is a 
public organization including officers in active service as well 
as those discharged into the reserve or retired. The 
association is experiencing hard times because of an ambiguous 
attitude to it on the part of the Defense Ministry. Obviously, 
there were some mistakes made by its leadership -- and therefore 
by myself since I belonged to it. One of them is preoccupation 
with political activities while the association's main goal is 
the consolidation of the Armed Forces. Also, issuing various 
declarations criticizing the commander in chief does not seem to 
make much sense. This is exactly what triggered a negative 
attitude among high-ranking officials. 
  No doubt, the SOU needs no help from the Armed Forces. On 
the contrary, the association itself morally supports the 
military. How? We consider it our obligation to instill the 
spirit of Ukrainian patriotism and the glorious traditions of 
the Ukrainian Army in the military personnel. The SOU sees this 
as its main thrust of activities, maintaining close contacts 
with many public organizations and participants of the 
national-liberation struggle, who can have a strong impact on 
education of the personnel. 
  Another aspect of our activities is the social protection of 
servicemen and members of their families as well as assisting 
the command in establishing a strict order in military units and 
components. 
  Today, we have to clearly define and adjust methods of 
restoring the SOU, and this is also a goal of its leadership. 
At the end of last year, SOU leaders met with Lieutenant 
General Kobzar, chief of the Main Education Administration and 
head of the Socio- Psychological Service at the Ukrainian 
Defense Administration. During the conversation, we found out 
that our positions regarding SOU's role in strengthening the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces are the same. As General Kobzar stated, 
the Ukrainian Defense Ministry will support all organizations 
that contribute to the Ukrainian Army's combat readiness, and 
said he would like to see the SOU playing a greater role in the 
consolidation of officers and cultivating the best military 
traditions. We talked about involving more amateur groups, 
professional artists, and simply interesting people in 
performing in military units. 
  In other words, the general and I had a very businesslike 
conversation, which he promised to communicate to the defense 
minister. I think we will soon meet with the latter. The 
Officers' Association ought to work in close collaboration with 
the Defense Ministry and all state structures in charge of 
protecting the independence of our state. After all, the SOU 
and the Defense Ministry fulfill that same task of state 
importance. 
  Bazelyuk: What is your attitude to Ukraine's 
nuclear disarmament? 
  Rol: Since 1991, I have repeatedly spoken through 
various media, maintaining that Ukraine must have nuclear 
weapons until any state that could become our potential 
adversary gets rid of its own nuclear arsenal. This is what I 
think. Whatever large army we have, it would be nothing 
compared to the nuclear potential, which is a means of 
protection for Ukraine. 
  The position of our political leadership has caused a number 
of negative processes. Back in the days when Ukraine was moving 
toward independence, it hastily proclaimed its intention to 
become a nonnuclear state. Here is another example. They ask: 
Why should Ukraine have the Black Sea Fleet since it declared 
that it needs the fleet only for local purposes? This is how 
the Black Sea Fleet arose with all its consequences. It is too 
bad that we so hurriedly gave up tactical weapons that could 
defend Ukraine better than even the strongest Army. You cannot 
guarantee national security without modern weapons. 
  Ukraine must proceed from the fact that it is impossible to 
ensure protection of the state against an enemy's armed assault, 
relying on other countries' guarantees only. In terms of combat 
readiness and national security of Ukraine, we should count only 
on our own strength. 
  Why does the West help Russia in all possible ways? Just 
because it has the powerful nuclear potential and is a strong 
state in this sense. 
  Bazelyuk: Is there anything one could do to retain 
the nuclear status? 
  Rol: In my opinion, the question "Should Ukraine 
be a nuclear state?" should be put to a nationwide referendum. 
I am outraged when some state lays down the law to us: "You 
must get rid of nuclear weapons." Who would dare to tell this 
to China, Great Britain, or France? 
  Bazelyuk: What do you think about the fact that 
the 43d Rocket Army personnel has not yet pledged allegiance to 
Ukraine? 
  Rol: I will look into this as the head of the 
Ukrainian Officers' Association. 
  Bazelyuk: You were proposed as a candidate to the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council. You have accepted the nomination... 
  Rol: Yes, I have. First of all, because I have a 
clear notion of what I would be doing in the Ukrainian 
legislature. If people trust me, I will press for strong 
political power that would introduce and maintain legal order in 
the country. After all, a political crisis is a power crisis. 
I will stand for a balanced implementation of reform based on 
all forms of ownership. In my opinion, state property should 
cover those industries and enterprises upon which the protection 
of our country's independence and national interests depends. I 
will demand the buildup of a national Ukrainian Army -- a 
guarantor of independence -- equipped with modern weapons.

<F P=106> [Ross Tieman report: "MPs Warn Over 18 Billion Pounds </F>
Nuclear Clean-Up Cost"] 
  [Text] Deep disquiet over the estimated 18 billion pounds 
cost of decommissioning Britain's nuclear power plants has been 
voiced by the powerful cross-party Commons Public Accounts 
Committee. 
  ln a hard-hitting review of the industry's provisions, the 
committee calls for a "visible, guaranteed fund to provide for 
decommissioning." Members suggest that the non-fossil fuel 
obligation, a 1 billion-pound-a-year levy on consumers' bills 
intended to fund decommissioning in England and Wales, is little 
more than a tax on consumers. 
  They say that while Nuclear Electric, the biggest 
state-owned 
atomic generator, seems confident that it can meet its 
obligations, Scottish Nuclear will become technically insolvent 
in the next financial year without further government 
intervention. 
  Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West and a member of 
the 
committee, said: "The Government is clearly charging a 10 per 
cent tax on electricity to pay for decommissioning nuclear power 
stations. It is costing the consumer 1 billion pounds a year. 
Until 1998, when this levy effectively ends, the consumer will 
pay this plus 17.5 per cent VAT (value added tax], leading to 
soaring bills." 
  The committee's report, The Cost of Decommissioning Nuclear 
Facilities, will increase pressure on the Government to draw up 
a broad brief for its overdue review of the nuclear industry's 
future. It will also add to the difficulties Nuclear Electric 
faces in its efforts to win planning consent to build a 
pressurised water plant in Suffolk, alongside the Sizewell B 
plant now nearing completion. 
  The two leading nuclear power companies last night defended 
themselves vigorously. John Collier, the chairman of Nuclear 
Electric, said: "We know exactly how to decommission all Nuclear 
Electric's power stations." The company's total decommissioning 
liability, in real terms, was 2.7 billion pounds, he said. 
"We're right on track to meet that bill without any need for 
subsidy or extension of the levy." 
  Robin Jeffrey, the chief executive of Scottish Nuclear, 
confirmed that his company would become technically insolvent if 
it failed to tackle its problems. But he added: "We have every 
confidence that cost-saving projects, which include the dry 
storage of spent fuel and a new approach to decommissioning 
known as Safestore, will ensure that the question of technical 
insolvency will not arise." 
  The Public Accounts Committee looked at decommissioning 
costs 
right across the industry. Its report notes that accounting 
provisions in the nuclear generating industry rose from 1.1 
billion pounds in 1987 to 3.76 billion pounds in 1989. Planned 
privatisation was subsequently abandoned because investors were 
worried about the industry's liabilities, including 
decommissioning. By 1992, the total cost of closing and removing 
civil nuclear plants and cleaning up associated radioactive 
contamination was estimated at 18 billion pounds for the four 
companies--Nuclear Electric, Scottish Nuclear, British Nuclear 
Fuels and AEA, the former Atomic Energy Authority. 
  The process involves removal of fuel and ancillary plant, 
followed a century later by dismantling and burial elsewhere of 
the reactor. 
  MPs are concerned that although Nuclear Electric says it has 
about 1.5 billion pounds of deposits for decommissioning with 
the National Loans Fund, some of the provisions have been used 
to fund construction of Sizewell B. The company insists that 
revenues from Sizewell will be used to top up the provisions.

<F P=106> [Due to copyright or other restrictions, the following is </F>
intended for use only by U.S. Government consumers. It is based 
on foreign media content and behavior and is issued without 
coordination with other U.S. Government components.] 
  [Analysis Note] In anticipation of a showdown with 
the Ukrainian parliament following the recent signing of the 
trilateral U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement on nuclear weapons, 
Ukrainian government officials have mounted a campaign to win 
parliament's acquiescence in the agreement, arguing that 
Ukraine's refusal to bend under Russian and world pressure has 
led to an agreement that meets the conditions laid down in the 
parliament's 18 November 1993 resolution on the START-I Treaty. 
In contrast, Russian officials--in a strategy Ukrainian 
opponents of the deal are likely to use against it--have 
suggested just the reverse, portraying the agreement as a 
vindication of their own strategy of marshaling international 
pressure on Ukraine to relinquish the nuclear arsenal deployed 
on its territory. Meanwhile, in a development likely to further 
diminish chances that the current Ukrainian parliament will go 
along with the deal, Russian and Ukrainian officials have 
expressed differing interpretations of a key provision of the 
accord on relief of Ukraine's energy debt to Russia. 
  The Ukrainian government has begun an uncharacteristically 
agressive battle with opponents in the Rada to win the 
parliament's acquiescence in the trilateral agreement signed by 
Presidents Clinton, Yeltsin, and Kravchuk on 14 January. Since 
returning to Kiev following the signing ceremony in Moscow, 
Kravchuk and other key Ukrainian government and military 
officials have mounted an offensive stressing that the agreement 
will provide security and economic benefits to Ukraine and 
enhance the country's international stature as well. 
<H5>  Kravchuk on the Offensive </H5>
  Both Kravchuk and the cabinet appear to be committed to 
defending the agreement. Kravchuk, en route to Moscow on 13 
January, suggested willingness to risk his political career by 
signing the accord, saying the "career of a politician cannot 
compare with the global problem we are solving" (Interfax, 13 
January). At a press conference held on his return to Kiev, 
Kravchuk lambasted domestic critics of the agreement who, he 
said, had accused the government of buckling under pressure from 
Russia and the United States and bringing Ukraine "to its 
knees." Calling such statements "absurd," Kravchuk claimed that 
the critics are "a minority" and "demonstrate their total 
ignorance." He took pains to dispel any impression that Ukraine 
had yielded to Russian or U.S. pressure, asserting that the 
agreement resulted from an understanding by Russia and the 
United States of Kiev's problems rather than "pressure or arm 
twisting" (Interfax, 14 January). Ukraine's negotiators, 
Kravchuk said, had remained steadfast in promoting the country's 
interests, thereby raising Ukraine's political prestige and 
image as a nation whose "policies are predictable" (Kiev radio, 
14 January). Kravchuk and other officials used the same 
argument in winning the endorsement of the Ukrainian Cabinet of 
Ministers on the eve of the signing, suggesting that the 
government will maintain a united front on the issue. According 
to Kiev radio (13 January), the government leaders praised "the 
active stand of Ukraine's representatives" in the trilateral 
negotiations in December and January, saying it produced "the 
essential progress" toward the agreement which would "guarantee 
our state's security and promise it considerable economic 
benefits." 
<H5>  Economic Benefits </H5>
  In an apparent effort to gain maximum leverage from the 
economic benefits of the agreement, Ukrainian officials have 
played up not only the benefits specified in the agreement, such 
as fuel rods for Ukrainian power reactors, but others they argue 
will accrue from improved relations with the United States, 
Russia, and the West resulting from the agreement: 
  -- Kravchuk, in his 14 January press conference in Kiev, 
said 
the agreement opens the way for expanded economic assistance 
from the United States, "international financial organizations, 
and Russia" (Kiev radio, 14 January). 
  -- In a roundtable discussion broadcast on Kiev radio (15 
January), Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko cited the U.S. 
commitment to establish a foundation for small businesses, a 
$155 million allocation to Ukraine by the United States for 
"economic reform," and "a whole series of specific projects and 
programs"--including, according to Defense Minister Vitaliy 
Radetskyy, U.S. assistance in providing housing for 
servicemen--expected to result from the pending visit to the 
United States of a Ukrainian economic delegation. Zlenko also 
hinted that the United States would increase the $175 million in 
dismantlement assistance it has promised Ukraine. "We know what 
other reserves they are talking about and, of course, we will be 
able to get access to those reserves so as to increase this 
sum," Zlenko said without elaboration. 
  -- In a similar vein, Deputy Prime Minister Deputy Shmarov, 
in remarks paraphrased by Kiev radio on 17 January, said 
Ukraine's denuclearization "will enable Ukraine to receive 
international financial aid, including much needed investment to 
help resolve defense conversion issues, overcome the economic 
crisis, and provide for the social protection of our people" 
(Kiev radio, 17 January). 
<H5>  Security Guarantees </H5>
  Government officials evidently feel that the issue of 
security guarantees presents the greatest challenge in their 
efforts to sell the agreement at home. They indirectly 
acknowledged that Ukraine had failed in its effort to obtain 
legally binding security guarantees from the United States and 
Russia, and highlighted instead the multilateral security 
guarantees accruing to nonnuclear parties to the 
Nonproliferation Treaty and emphasized Russia's pledge not to 
use economic pressure against Ukraine: 
  -- Clearly uncomfortable when asked repeatedly about 
security 
guarantees for Ukraine, Kravchuk, in his 14 January press 
conference, responded vaguely, at one point suggesting that 
security guarantees are not very meaningful. "Security does not 
mean signed documents," Kravchuk said, stressing instead that 
the road to security begins with "civilized" policies. When 
pressed further, Kravchuk cited the tripartite agreement's 
pledge to "respect the territorial integrity, inviolability of 
borders, sovereignty, and independence of Ukraine." Kravchuk 
added that by joining the NPT, "those security guarantees will 
acquire a more specific, precise nature." And he noted that 
Russia had pledged not to use "economic pressure" against 
Ukraine. 
  -- Zlenko, in contrast, was more self-assured on the issue 
of 
security guarantees in the 15 January roundtable discussion on 
Kiev radio, asserting that Ukraine had successfully won 
"multilateral" assurances of security through the NPT process 
rather than mere "bilateral" assurances and adding that France 
had also offered security guarantees. Underscoring his point, 
Zlenko asked, "Do you understand what we are talking about? 
What does it mean for our state, which is still unsteady on its 
feet of independence, to receive political guarantees from 
leading nuclear states? It is a guarantee protecting Ukraine's 
political sovereignty." 
<H5>  Military Endorsements </H5>
  Ukrainian military officials also gave their stamp of 
approval to the agreement affirming that the agreement 
adequately protects Ukraine's security, and pointing out that 
since Kiev does not control the nuclear weapons on its soil, 
they afford Ukraine no real security: 
  -- In an 18 January press conference, Radetskyy said he 
"fully supports" the agreement, adding, according to paraphrased 
remarks, that Ukraine "is incapable of maintaining its own 
nuclear weapons at the moment and would have to get rid of them 
sooner or later" (Kiev UNIAN, 18 January). Earlier, Radetskyy 
said "high-precision" conventional weapons are more valuable for 
Ukraine's security and that he plans to report "in the near 
future" to the defense Council on plans to "compensate for the 
withdrawal of the nuclear weapons" (Kiev radio, 15 January). 
  -- In a similar vein, Deputy Defense Minister Col. Gen. Ivan 
Oliynik said the nuclear arms in Ukraine had no bearing "on the 
issues of our security. We do not control these weapons, we 
cannot maintain them.... and we cannot but implement the 
decision taken by our state to become non-nuclear in the 
future." He also said Ukraine would "have to rely on our own 
forces [and] create nonnuclear forces that can enable us to 
ensure the protection of our state" (Kiev radio, 18 January). 
<H5>  Safety Issue Played Up </H5>
  In an unusual twist to support their efforts to sell the 
agreement, Ukrainian officials have also adopted a Russian 
argument, which until recently they had heatedly rebutted, that 
the current physical condition of nuclear warheads in Ukraine is 
deteriorating dangerously. In his 14 January news conference, 
Kravchuk himself raised the prospect--often used by Russian 
military officials--of a nuclear nightmare on Ukrainian soil, 
saying Ukraine is "obliged to remove [the weapons] because they 
are more dreadful than all the Chernobyl-type accidents taken 
together," adding, "we cannot maintain them with due 
responsibility for our future" (Kiev radio, 14 January). At an 
18 January press conference, Kostyantyn Hryhschenko, chief of 
disarmament for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reportedly said 
warheads stored in Ukraine are increasingly unstable and pose a 
serious environmental threat to Ukraine (UNIAR, Kiev radio, 18 
January). 
<H5>  Party and Legislative Reaction </H5>
  Although some Ukrainian opposition leaders condemned the 
agreement even before it had been signed and released, a number 
of key legislators adopted a wait-and-see attitude while others 
expressed support. Meanwhile, at a parliamentary meeting on 20 
January, several relevant committees (foreign affairs, defense 
and security, and legislation and legality) were instructed to 
prepare by 25 January a "resolution" on the "compatibility" of 
the trilateral agreement with the parliament's 18 November 
resolution (UNIAN, 20 January). 
  Legislative Opponents. Some leaders of the main 
opposition party People's Movement of Ukraine (Rukh) 
vituperatively opposed the agreement, although some other 
leading members took a more moderate stand. Rukh Chairman 
Vyacheslav Chornovil called the agreement "a national betrayal," 
and Les Tanyuk, a Rukh leader and member of the parliament's 
presidium, asserted Ukraine had been brought "to its knees" 
(UNIAN, AFP, 14 January; Interfax, 18 January). However, 
another Rukh leader, Volodymyr Chernyak, was less harsh, 
praising the agreement for opening possibilities for economic 
cooperation and compensation, but faulting it for being short on 
security guarantees (UNIAN, 13 January). Similarly, a statement 
issued by the Conservative Republican Party, headed by the 
well-known radical nationalist Stepan Khmara, reportedly claimed 
that Kravchuk had "acted contrary to Ukraine's national 
interests" in signing the agreement (Krasnaya Zvezda, 19 
January). Mykhaylo Horyn, leader of the Ukrainian Republican 
Party, keyed on Ukraine's national security interests, asserting 
in an interview published on 12 January that Ukraine should 
retain indefinitely the 46 SS-24 ICBMs deployed on Ukrainian 
soil. Horyn urged Kravchuk not to sign the agreement, saying it 
would be an "irreparable blunder" (Za Vilnu Ukrayinu). 
  Undecided Legislators. A number of key 
legislators said that they needed to study the document before 
taking a stand and claimed that if the accord did not meet the 
conditions set out in parliament's 18 November resolution on 
START-I they would oppose it. According to the Ukrainian news 
agency UNIAR, parliament speaker Ivan Plyushch was "refraining 
from comment" until the "relevant documents are studied" (15 
January). Yuriy Kostenko, Minister of Environmental Protection 
and head of the parliamentary commission on ratification of 
START-I, was similarly cited by Russian media as saying that he 
would "like to read the text" of the agreement before drawing 
any "conclusions" about whether it conforms to the parliament's 
conditions (ITAR-TASS, Moscow radio, 16 January). In April 
1993, Kostenko was widely reported to have claimed that the 
nuclear weapons on its territory made Ukraine a "nuclear state" 
(Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 27 April 1993; Kiev radio, 28 April 1993). 
According to the Russian news agency Interfax, Yevgeniy 
Marmazov, deputy head of the parliament's foreign affairs 
commission, told an interviewer that the legislature would "not 
ratify the deal unless the conditions it had set" were met, but 
he apparently did not draw any preliminary conclusion as to 
whether the agreement met this test (14 January). 
  Supportive Legislators. Some legislative leaders 
have reacted positively to the agreement, some citing the 
participation of the United States in the accord and some the 
economic benefits to Ukraine. Mykola Shulha, chairman of the 
parliamentary committee for issues of state sovereignty and 
inter-republic and inter-ethnic relations, told a Ukrainian 
interviewer that he would "endeavor to convince" parliament to 
support the agreement, arguing that Russian adherence to the 
terms of the agreement was guaranteed by the "global authority 
of such an influential state as America" (UNIAN, 14 January). 
Vladimir Grinyev, former deputy head of parliament and leader 
of the New Ukraine Movement, reportedly said that he is 
"supportive" of the agreement and that Ukraine will "reap 
economic dividends" from it (Interfax, 18 January). 
<H5>  Russian Reaction </H5>
  While Ukrainian officials have stressed the benefits of the 
agreement to Ukraine, Russian officials have let it be known 
that they view the agreement as the fruit of their and U.S. 
efforts to pressure Ukraine to relinquish the nuclear arsenal on 
its territory: 
  -- During in a joint press conference with President Clinton 
on 14 January, Yeltsin did not demur when an ITAR-TASS 
correspondent spoke of Russian efforts during Yeltsin's recent 
visit to Brussels to get the United States and NATO "to exert 
more influence" on Ukraine. Asked if his "hopes" on this score 
had been justified, Yeltsin replied, "I think our hopes have 
been justified extremely quickly" (Russian TV, 14 January). 
  -- An unnamed "senior official" of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs reportedly told Interfax that the "extremely negative 
reaction" by the world community--above all Russia and the 
United States--to Kiev's earlier hesitant stand on the nuclear 
question "was understood by Leonid Kravchuk" (1O January). 
  -- In a 12 January article in the government newspaper 
Rossiyskaya Gazeta, commentator Vladimir Kuznechevskiy wrote 
that Kravchuk was "unable to withstand the combined pressure of 
the U.S. and Russian presidents" and had therefore "agreed" to 
sign the document giving up nuclear weapons. 
  Russian officials may also view the trilateral signing as 
evidence of tacit U.S. acknowledgment of the primacy of Russia's 
role among states of the former Soviet Union. Member of the 
Presidential Council Andranik Migranyan, in 17 January remarks 
disseminated by ITAR-TASS, said that with the trilateral 
agreement the United States had confirmed "Russia's special role 
in maintaining stability on the territory of the post-Soviet 
space." The same sentiment was expressed in a Nezavisimaya 
Gazeta commentary on the trilateral talks (13 January), which 
asserted that Yeltsin "managed to demonstrate the role his 
country is playing in the former Soviet Union: Leonid Kravchuk 
and Bill Clinton will negotiate on his territory and he himself 
will be involved in the talks." 
<H5>  Disagreement Over Compensation </H5>
  A controversy over the possibility of debt relief for 
Ukraine 
as part of the trilateral agreement demonstrates a serious 
divergence in the two sides' interpretation of the agreement. 
Although it has been widely reported that Russia agreed in the 
tripartite talks to write off all or part of Ukraine's energy 
debt as compensation for tactical nuclear weapons removed from 
Ukraine in 1992, (Interfax, 12 January; Moscow radio, 14 
January), some Russian officials have denied such a possibility, 
thereby angering Ukrainian officials who are trying to sell the 
agreement on its economic merits. Kozyrev, in remarks on 14 
January, said that "any write-off of the Ukrainian debt is out 
of the question" (Interfax, 14 January). In addition, a senior 
official of Gosprom, a leading Russian gas producer, said the 
Russian government would "never" agree to compensate Ukraine for 
denuclearization by writing off its energy debt (Interfax, 12 
January). Zlenko reportedly reacted with "surprise and 
disagreement" to Kozyrev's statement, saying, in remarks 
paraphrased 14 January by Interfax, that a Ukrainian debt relief 
"formula" was "laid down in the agreement." In a 14 January 
press conference at the Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow, Kravchuk 
said the "amount and form" of compensation for tactical nuclear 
weapons removed from Ukraine in 1992 was yet to be determined, 
but that "one option" was debt relief for Ukrainian energy 
imports. 
<H5>  Outlook </H5>
  The number of Ukrainian legislators reserving judgement on 
the agreement offers some hope that Kravchuk may be able to sway 
the parliament's final reaction to the agreement, and Kravchuk 
and the Ukrainian Government appear to be forcefully pushing the 
agreement now. But in the past, Kravchuk has backed away from 
controversial decisions, such as the signing of the Massandra 
agreement with Russia, when the political heat rose. Moscow's 
view of the trilateral agreement, which surely will not go 
unnoticed in Ukraine, may raise the heat for Kravchuk by 
undermining his strongest selling points: enhanced 
international prestige and economic benefits. Kravchuk's 
domestic opponents will likely use the Russians' statements that 
the agreement was the product of pressure on Ukraine against 
him, particularly as the campaign for Ukraine's 27 March 
legislative election gets into full swing. The apparent 
disagreement over debt relief to Ukraine is also likely to 
complicate Kravchuk's effort to sell the agreement on its 
economic merits and may raise additional difficulties when the 
parties attempt to resolve outstanding issues of implementation.

<F P=106> [By reporter Gao Jian (7559 1017)] </F>
  [Text] United Nations, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- A Chinese 
representative said here today that only by making a definite 
commitment to the complete prohibition and thorough destruction 
of nuclear weapons and by adopting appropriate and resolute 
steps to that end will the measures of nuclear states to prevent 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons have a genuine significance. 
  The second session of the preparatory committee for the 1995 
conference of parties to the Treaty on Nonproliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons was convened this week at the United Nations 
Headquarters in New York. Sha Zukang, head of the Chinese 
delegation to the session expounded China's views on how to 
effectively prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  Sha Zukang said China recognizes the importance of the 
prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons as well as 
the maintenance of an effective international legal mechanism 
for that purpose. At the same time, China also believes that 
nonproliferation by itself is not the ultimate goal that the 
mankind should pursue, and that the real objective should be 
complete prohibition, thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, 
and realization of a nuclear-free world. 
  Sha Zukang believes that only by making a definite 
commitment 
and by adopting appropriate and resolute steps to that end will 
the measures of nuclear states to prevent the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons have a genuine significance. He said failure to 
do that will perpetuate the defect of the existing imbalance in 
the treaty in the rights and obligations between the nuclear and 
nonnuclear states. To realize quickly the objective of the 
total prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, a 
large number of nonnuclear countries have given up the option of 
acquiring and developing nuclear weapons; however, their demand 
for security guarantees has not been fundamentally satisfied. 
  Sha Zukang said the Chinese Government believes that 
conditions are ripe for all nuclear states to make the 
commitment of not being the first to use nuclear weapons and not 
to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear 
states and nuclear free zones. 
  Sha Zukang criticized some big nuclear powers for a lack of 
sincerity for peace in this respect. He said if nuclear states, 
particularly the big nuclear powers with global nuclear attack 
capability, are unable to take even the limited step of 
guaranteeing that they will not be the first to use nuclear 
weapons and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons 
against nonnuclear states and nuclear free zones, how can they 
expect the large number of nonnuclear states to trust their 
sincerity for peace. 
  He pointed out that it will be difficult to ensure 
universality and enduring effectiveness for the international 
nuclear nonproliferation mechanism if nuclear states only make 
one-sided emphasis on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons 
and if they only emphasize their own absolute security to the 
neglect of the nonnuclear states' legitimate security concerns.

  [Text] United Nations, January 21 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese 
representative today called for "all nuclear states to undertake 
not to be the first to use nuclear weapons and not to use or 
threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states and 
nuclear free zones." 
  Sha Zukang, head of the Chinese delegation to the session, 
expounded on how to effectively prevent the spread of nuclear 
weapons at the second session of the preparatory committee for 
the 1995 conference of parties to the treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which was held this week 
and concluded today. 
  Sha said "China attaches great importance to the prevention 
of nuclear weapons proliferation and the maintenance of an 
effective international legal mechanism for that purpose." 
  "At the same time, China also believes that 
non-proliferation 
by itself is not the ultimate goal for mankind, and that the 
objective must be complete prohibition and thorough destruction 
of nuclear weapons." 
  As the nuclear countries fail to agree to ban and destroy 
nuclear weapons, "the imbalance inherent in the treaty in the 
rights and obligations between the nuclear and non-nuclear 
states is perpetuated and the security demand by many 
non-nuclear states cannot be genuinely assured." 
  So, people should put emphasis on the commitment by the 
nuclear nations to non-first-use and non-use of nuclear weapons, 
Sha stressed. 
  "The Chinese Government believes that conditions are now 
ripe" for making that commitment, Sha said. 
  The reason, he went on, is that with the ending of the Cold 
War era, the first-use defense doctrines of the East and West 
based on a balance of nuclear terror and nuclear deterrence 
against conventional supremacy have lost their validity and 
pretext. 
  Sha criticized some big super nuclear powers for lack of 
sincerity for peace. 
  "Should the nuclear states, the largest nuclear states with 
global nuclear attack capabilities in particular, emphasize only 
non-proliferation and their own absolute security to the neglect 
of the legitimate concerns of the non-nuclear states,... how can 
they expect the large number of non-nuclear states trust their 
sincerity for peace," he said.

  [Text] Ukraine's Ambassador to China Anatoliy Plyushko, 
presented Dzhou Syau Pey, deputy director of the Eastern Europe 
and Central Asia department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
of the People's Republic of China, with the resolution of the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine of 3 February 1994 regarding 
ratification of the START I Treaty. 
  During the conversation, the ambassador emphasized that when 
adopting this resolution, the successful specific measures taken 
by the president and government of Ukraine in resolving the 
problems, which had been the cause of a number of important 
reservations on the part of the Supreme Council when ratifying 
START I in November of last year, (?had come to the fore) in 
parliament. 
  In this context it was emphasized that the accords achieved 
by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States of America, and 
Russia in Moscow, and recorded in the trilateral statement and 
appendix to it, had created objective conditions for the Supreme 
Council to withdraw its reservations. It was stressed that the 
Supreme Council resolution shows the consistency of Ukraine's 
foreign policy course and its faithfulness to its declared 
intention to become a non-nuclear state in the future. This 
peace-loving step by Ukraine will undoubtedly have a positive 
influence on the whole process of nuclear disarmament. 
  Dzhou Syau Pey stated that China has an understanding 
attitude to Ukraine's foreign policy and fully approves of its 
desire and readiness to eliminate the nuclear weapons located on 
its territory. He noted that the Chinese side highly evaluated 
the documents signed by the three presidents in Moscow and 
considers that the resolution adopted by Ukraine's Parliament on 
3 February opens the way to implementing the accords reached by 
them. Dzhou Syau Pey was also acquainted in detail with 
Ukraine's proposal to conduct a world peace conference in 1995 
within the framework of the UN's 50th anniversary celebrations, 
and a memorandum on this issue was also presented.

<F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko at the Supreme </F>
Council session in Kiev on 3 February -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Esteemed deputies, esteemed president, esteemed 
Ivan Stepanovych. You understand that the question or the whole 
problem of nuclear weapons that are located in Ukraine remains, 
for the moment, the most important problem. I would like to 
begin by saying that after the Supreme Council's ratification of 
START I, neither Russia nor the United States recognized the act 
of ratification as though it had taken place. Obviously, this 
is why we were forced to deal with an extraordinary situation 
and forced to resolve, in a short period of time, exceptionally 
complex issues. I would like to say that the situation 
developed in a very complicated way. Since the first days of 
Ukraine's independence we had never felt such intense 
international pressure, the main aim of which was to isolate us 
as quickly and as broadly as possible internationally. The main 
thing that is almost completely unacceptable and was 
unacceptable and which provoked the toughest reaction was the 
refusal by Ukraine to accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT]. On this issue I would like to assure you that 
there is an absolute consensus by CSCE member countries. The 
treaty should be universal and undoubtedly extended for an 
unspecified period. We have been given to understand that by 
refusing to accede to the NPT, Ukraine is joining a group of 
states that do not have a very high rating in the world and many 
of the world's democratic countries are talking about this. The 
second thing is that doubt was cast on the very fact that 
Ukraine would ratify the START treaty and a rumor was spread 
that Ukraine was reviewing its policy of attaining nonnuclear 
status as set out in its basic foreign policy documents. 
Obviously great harm was inflicted on Ukraine's international 
image. I will be frank. To achieve glory as an unreliable 
international partner that fails to abide by its promises -- 
moreover a country that is only two years old -- is a very 
disadvantageous and I would even say almost hopeless situation. 
To remain without support in the world community, even if one 
thinks one is right, is a losing game. You do not have to go 
far for examples. 
  I would like to note separately that President Leonid 
Makarovych Kravchuk's position on this, which he announced in a 
speech soon after the ratification of the START treaty, is 
exceptionally important. It was really an important political 
and diplomatic step. Thanks to it we managed to avoid, without 
any exaggeration, serious complications. Such a position left 
the doors open for us for contacts and for future work. How did 
our foreign policy department act under these conditions? I 
would like to tell you, esteemed people's deputies, that 
practically in the first hours following the ratification of the 
START treaty, the ministry began work on explaining the content 
of the Supreme Council's resolutions and the motives that caused 
it to raise the reservations at the time of ratification. 
[Passage omitted: explains the mechanism by which Ukrainian 
embassies informed foreign ministries of other states and how 
Ukraine's foreign minister personally wrote to all the world's 
leading states, including the UN and NATO general secretaries, 
explaining the Ukrainian position on the ratification of START; 
Kravchuk's 30-minute telephone conversation with President 
Clinton and his telegrams to Russian President Boris Yeltsin; 
explanatory work carried out at the CSCE conference in Rome; 
Ukraine's negative image reflected in various publications] 
  You recall the phrase spoken by our president, Leonid 
Makarovych: It is the first time that I am experiencing such a 
difficult situation that Ukraine was fated to endure at the 
beginning of December 1993. We did not broadcast this widely. 
We could not do this because we understood that the nation 
might not be able to withstand all this. We dealt with this and 
worked on it calmly and took it to its conclusion. Esteemed 
deputies, international isolation -- and I would like to place 
particular emphasize on this -- creates such an attitude in the 
world toward an isolated country that any kind of forced methods 
against it are received as a naturally forced reaction to its 
behavior. As an example, I would like to remind you of the 
course of events on the eve of the war in the Persian Gulf. 
Then the United States and its allies made use of the full 
isolation of Iraq almost six months before the military 
operation, to find support for its actions throughout the entire 
world community. It was a great mistake not to take into 
account Russia's reactions on the possible transformation of 
Ukraine into a nuclear state. You are aware that such an option 
is not only unacceptable to the political and military 
leadership of that country but also plays the role of a popular 
slogan for those like one of the winners in the recent elections 
who support the transformation of Ukraine into a new Russian 
province [huberniya]. In this connection I would like to return 
to the key issues for our security and future as an independent 
state, the value of nuclear weapons as a restraining factor. 
Foreign experts and the overwhelming majority of those who 
understand these things tell us that the only weapon capable of 
halting aggression is the one that can be put to real use by 
inflicting unacceptable harm on the aggressor. Not only us, but 
all nuclear state know that Ukraine does not have operational 
control over the nuclear weapons located on our territory. 
[Passage omitted: repeats Kravchuk's statements about not being 
able to service the weapons and that they are a threat to 
Ukraine's own security] 
  I would also like to dwell on safeguarding Ukraine's 
interests and above all the national security of our state. It 
seems that the state of our economy clearly underlines an 
obvious and undeniable truth or thesis that is only too obvious 
today: that the main component of any state's security is a 
healthy economy and socio-political stability in society. If 
this does not exist, no kind of nuclear weapon, even if it is 
controlled and reliable, will help. The example of the former 
USSR serves as an example, and Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] 
spoke about this. We must consider whether we can preserve 
independence achieved at this price if, having found ourselves 
in isolation and without friends in the world, we encounter a 
situation where supplies of energy sources and in particular of 
nuclear fuel, are completely cut off and every kind of economic 
cooperation is frozen. Could we survive for long? [Passage 
omitted: speaks about the problems of Ukraine's nuclear power 
industry, the trilateral talks in Moscow, the foreign ministry's 
utmost attempts to defend Ukraine's position at the talks; the 
need for compromise; the agreement fulfils the conditions set 
out by the Supreme Council on 18 November 1993; sums up the 
arguments in favor of Ukraine getting rid of nuclear weapons 
including the end of Ukraine's isolation] 
  We will be frank, esteemed deputies. It is a serious and 
difficult political decision but I am certain that it is the 
only one possible under the present conditions. It is about 
preserving not only Ukraine's positive image in international 
relations but about the very survival of our state. Thank you 
for your attention.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--An Arab diplomatic source has 
said that the Working Group on Arms Control and Regional 
Security, emanating from the multilateral talks on peace in the 
Middle East and now meeting in Cairo, has not yet reached an 
agreement on arms control because the Israelis are expressing 
reservations at conducting a detailed discussion of the subject. 
  The source told MENA today that the Israelis are mainly 
concentrating on the first part--arrangements for regional 
security with a view toward breaking the Arab wall around Israel. 
  The source said the Israeli delegation wants to finish 
promptly with security arrangements, as this would mean an 
implicit recognition of Israel by the region's states, while it 
refrains from entering into a detailed discussion of arms 
control. 
  It should be noted that the prevailing view among the 
delegates is that the two subjects must be discussed together 
without focusing on one to the exclusion of the other.

  [Text] Jakarta, Feb 3 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Indonesia is 
planning to ratify the prohibition of chemical weapons 
convention by the end of 1994, a senior Foreign Ministry 
official announced. 
  Hasan Wirayuda, the ministry's director of International 
Organization Affairs, told a press conference here Wednesday: 
"The House of Representatives will have to discuss this matter 
before okaying the plan and hopefully the discussion can be 
completed by the end of this year." 
  Wirayuda said that Indonesia had taken part in tough 
international negotiations on the phasing out of chemical 
weapons since they began in 1980 up to their conclusion in 1992 
although Indonesia did not possess chemical weapons. 
  He added that Indonesia's participation, which manifested 
the 
country's concern for national and regional security, was 
significant because it was the largest country in Southeast Asia 
and now chairing the Non-Aligned Movement. 
  Vested with such national, regional, and global 
responsibilities Indonesia had no option but become a party to 
the convention, a position enabling it along with the 
international community to strive after the abolition of 
chemical weapons, and supervise the ban on their proliferation 
through the convention's system of verification, he said. 
  He added that Indonesia had formed an interdepartmental 
committee assigned to prepare for the ratification. 
  The committee was made up of representatives of the 
Ministries of Industry, Defence and Security, Trade, and Health, 
the Armed Forces Headquarters, the Agency for the Assessment and 
Application of Technology (BPPT) and the surveyor company 
Surveyor Indonesia Co. Ltd. 
  The visiting executive secretary of the Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat, Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical 
Weapons (PTS-OPCW), Ian Kenyon, meanwhile has welcomed 
Indonesia's plan to ratify the convention. 
  At present, only four of its 154 signatory countries had 
ratified it. 
  Signatories to the convention to date were the United 
States, 
Russia, all Western European countries, all former socialist 
counrties in Eastern Europe, and a number of Latin American and 
Asian countries, Wirayuda said.

  [Excerpts] La Paz, 26 Jan (EFE) -- The newspaper LA RAZON 
reported today that alleged Bolivian drug "kingpin" Isaac 
Chavarria was arrested by the Special Antinarcotics Force 
(FELCN) during a vast operation that included the arrests of 
another 43 "important" drug traffickers. 
  According to LA RAZON, Chavarria's arrest was announced by a 
"source close to the U.S. Embassy in La Paz." 
  The Interior Ministry announced that it will summon a news 
conference within the next few hours to provide details about 
the antidrug operation that led to Chavarria's arrest. 
  The Santa Cruz police department has reported that 18 
persons 
have been arrested over the last few hours in antidrug 
operations conducted in Cochabamba and Santa Cruz Departments. 
  During these operations the police confiscated several of 
Chavarria's properties in Okinawa, a town settled by Japanese 
immigrants located 40 km from Cochabamba. 
  Chavarria, a private pilot who is around 45 years old, was 
involved in the "narcopictures" and "narcovideos" political 
scandal that occurred at the end of the 1980's, which compelled 
political parties to achieve agreements and bury investigations 
on the alleged connections between political leaders and drug 
traffickers. [passage omitted] 
  According to U.S. Embassy sources in La Paz cited by LA 
RAZON, Chavarria became one of the largest drug traffickers 
after Carmelo "Meco" Dominguez was arrested, and is presumably 
one of the main suppliers of cocaine to the Colombian cartels.

<F P=106> [Report from Santa Cruz de la Sierra] </F>
  [Excerpts] Government Minister German Quiroga today held a 
news conference to inform the public about the arrest of Isaac 
Chavarria Diez de Medina during a special operation by the 
Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) on 25 and 26 January. 
Quiroga also reported that 21 other people, who allegedly are 
members of one of the largest drug trafficking rings in the 
country, also were taken into custody as a result of this drug 
enforcement operation. The minister noted that this constitutes 
a mortal blow to a gang that has been operating in Bolivia and 
other countries since the mid-70's thanks to the support of 
Colombian drug cartels. The gang led by Chavarria was not only 
engaged in selling thousands of kilograms of illegal drugs but 
also the laundering of millions of U.S. dollars. 
  Moreover, Meco Domingez' cooperation with police since he 
was 
arrested by police last December on drug trafficking charges 
played a decisive role as it enabled police to arrest these 22 
people. [passage omitted] 
  Chavarria's gang turned over 500 kg of drugs every 
fortnight. 
It is believed that the drug was processed in sophisticated 
laboratories located in some forested regions in El Beni 
Department. [passage omitted] 
  During this operation--called Endless--the FELCN conducted a 
mass roundup of alleged drug traffickers and seized 14 
properties and a large number of weapons, including rifles, 
shotguns, machine guns, grenades, and three radio transmitters.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos MacArthur: "DPF Beats Records in Drug </F>
Seizures"] 
  [Text] For the Federal Police Department [DPF], 1993 was 
the year of drugs. The volume of drugs seized between January 
and November was three times higher than in all of 1992. And the 
big champion was cocaine at 8,000 kg. The biggest cocaine 
seizure occurred in Rio Grande do Sul when a single operation by 
the Drug Enforcement Division (DRE) took two metric tons of the 
drug out of circulation. 
  According to the DRE's director, Sergio Sakon, the increase 
in drug seizures results from the fact that Brazil has become 
the main exit route for cocaine produced by the Colombian and 
Bolivian cartels. Sakon points out that Brazil has a very wide 
range of ports through which 95 percent of Brazil's exports 
pass. The traffickers take advantage of that to conceal the drug 
in logs and even in electrical transformers. Moreover, many 
ships wait outside Brazil's territorial waters for small boats 
or helicopters to bring them the merchandise, which will then be 
sold on the U.S. or European market. 
  Brazil's neighbors in South America are Peru, the largest 
producer of coca base; Colombia, the biggest refiner; and 
Bolivia, a big producer. All of them take advantage of the lack 
of surveillance and of border posts, especially in the Amazon 
Region, to transport the coca base. 
  In 1993, the DRE intensified its cooperation with 
international organizations and foreign governments for the 
purpose of controlling drugs. Thanks to exchanges with Germany, 
Great Britain, and the United States, Federal Police agents have 
been attending advanced training courses abroad, and foreign 
experts have visited our country. In Sergio Sakon's opinion, the 
results are visible in the considerable number of 
"mules"--independent couriers--arrested in 1993 before they 
boarded aircraft at the international airports in Rio de Janeiro 
and Sao Paulo. 
<H5>  Operations Cover Entire Country </H5>
  Inroads into gangs of drug traffickers in 1993 were not 
restricted to just one region. The various operations resulted 
in the seizure of coca base and cocaine from north to south: two 
metric tons in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul), 90 kg in Mato 
Grosso, 1,100 kg in Belem (Para), 220 kg in Fortaleza, 550 in 
Manaus, and 200 kg in the Mato Grosso town of Nova Olimpia. 
  And in Amazonas, Federal Police destroyed 80,000 epadu 
(Brazilian coca) plants growing on four plantations. The choice 
of Amazonas for planting Brazilian coca is explained by the 
region's climatic conditions and the area's large expanse, which 
makes access and policing difficult. 
  The various operations taking place in 1993 included the 
destruction of 2,139,000 marijuana plants in the Sao Francisco 
Valley and the Pernambuco back country--the equivalent of a 
little over two metric tons of the drug. Those operations, known 
as "Monte Santo," "Ouricuri," and "Independence," took place 
with the cooperation of the Army, whose troops helped eradicate 
the plantings discovered in the Northeast Region. 
<H5>  Amphetamines Gaining Ground </H5>
  A growing concern among authorities in 1993 was the 
appearance of large amounts of amphetamines in the drug market. 
Although centers of use were detected in most regions of the 
country, the southern states seem to have the largest number of 
laboratories. Following an exhaustive investigation lasting more 
than three months, the Federal Police succeeded in closing two 
illegal laboratories, one in Campinas in Sao Paulo State and the 
other in Florianopolis. 
  The largest seizure of amphetamines involved 300 kg of MDA, 
whose effects are not well known but which can be manufactured 
on a large scale at a reasonably low cost. Closing down the 
laboratory in the capital of Santa Catarina put an end to a gang 
with branches in the states of Mato Grosso, Para, and Rio Grande 
do Sul and left hanging the suspicion that there has been a new 
escalation of drugs in our country. 
<H5>  Battle Against Illegal Prospecting </H5>
  The Operations Department of the Federal Police took action 
in the Amazon Region in 1993 to combat more than the drug 
traffic. At the very start of the year, Operation "Catrimani" 
arrived in the Ianomami area to evict prospectors and conduct a 
survey for the purpose of beginning Operation "Free Forest," 
which removed more than 4,000 prospectors from the reservations 
beginning in February. The result was the seizure of three 
aircraft and a large quantity of fuel. 
  The work continued when the Mato Grosso superintendency 
stepped in to evict lumbermen and prospectors from Nambiquara 
Indian reservations. The greatest destruction there was in the 
protected areas of valuable timber species such as mahogany and 
cherry wood. Many weapons and large amounts of ammunition were 
seized. 
  In southern Para, two operations took up a good part of the 
year as agents looked for clandestine radio stations used in the 
drug traffic and investigated slavery, chiefly involving 
underage girls forced into prostitution.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos MacArthur: "PF Lacks Money for Monitoring </F>
Amazon Region"] 
  [Text] The Federal Police [PF] need $248 million with which 
to carry out protective actions and stimulate sustainable 
development in the Amazon Region. The program's objectives 
include combating conflicts with Indians, land conflicts, the 
drug traffic, smuggling, and illegal mining. Since repression of 
those crimes is the exclusive duty of the Federal Police, that 
force's leadership is seeking external funds. 
  The Amazon Region is currently a genuine open border, 
according to Superintendent Mauro Sposito, because the PF's 
activity in the region is totally impaired by the lack of a 
surveillance, inspection, and monitoring system. For that 
reason, the superintendent points out, agents are being trained 
to work with experts from the Ministry of Communications in 
operating mobile radio stations that can trace conversations 
taking place in the region's isolated locations between the 
Colombian and Bolivian drug cartels. 
  The Federal Police are aware that the Amazon Region is 
currently the gateway through which drugs enter Brazil. The fact 
is that since the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1990, Brazil has 
become the preferred route for traffickers who once used the 
"Caribbean route." The lack of suitable equipment puts the PF at 
a disadvantage, and seizures do not exceed 5 percent of the 
total volume moving through the country. Sposito points out that 
in a survey by Interpol, it is estimated that the drug 
traffickers have annual revenues of $500 billion just from the 
sale of cocaine all over the world. 
  Because of the high prices generated by cocaine, the product 
has created a real chain of crime all around it, the 
superintendent explains. It is money from drug trafficking that 
finances kidnappings, auto thefts, smuggling, and even bank 
holdups. On that subject, the Federal Police draw a parallel by 
emphasizing that when an operation to repress key points in the 
drug traffic is intensified, the response by the gangs is almost 
immediate in the form of an increased number of bank holdups. 
"All one need do is remember that case in Rio de Janeiro where a 
joint operation was mounted by the PF and the Army. News of 
those operations and two raids by the Army in one of the 
shantytowns harmed the drug traffic, and two banks were held up 
right after that." 
  Federal Police officials say that the PF now has a wealth of 
information and maps concerning the activity of drug traffickers 
in the Amazon Region and even of illegal gold mines and other 
mines. 
<H5>  Tracking Crime </H5>
  Mapping work has made it possible to identify operators of 
illegal mines who join with drug traffickers to invade Indian 
lands. Once the Indians are evicted, both sides profit from the 
mining of minerals and the construction of clandestine landing 
strips. Approximately 90 percent of the gold produced in Brazil 
is smuggled out. 
  Pro-Amazon Region: By implementing the project scheduled for 
the start of 1994, Federal Police hope to reduce those crime 
levels considerably. The project calls for opening 54 police 
stations in the region over the next four years, hiring new 
agents, and providing the units with suitable equipment, as well 
as cooperating with international scientific communities in the 
fields of chemistry, biochemistry, botany, and animal husbandry. 
Beginning in January, the Advanced Training, Study, and Research 
Center in Manaus will receive 160 agents for training. 
  To speed up and debureaucratize its activities, the PF is 
going to divide the Amazon Region into three sections. One of 
the operational centers--in Manaus--will cover the states of 
Amazonas and Roraima. The center in Belem will be responsible 
for the states of Amapa and Maranhao, and the third center, in 
Porto Velho, will take care of Acre, Mato Grosso, and Rondonia. 
The PF's operations will also involve Ibama [Brazilian Institute 
for the Environment], Funai [National Indian Foundation], and 
Incra [National Land Reform and Settlement Institute].

<F P=106> [Article by Deuza Lopes: "Confen Lacks Funds for Combating </F>
Drugs"] 
  [Text] Even though President Itamar Franco has designated 
1993 the International Year of Struggle Against the Drug 
Traffic, the Federal Council on Narcotics (Confen)--the agency 
responsible for policy in that sector--has run out of money with 
which to implement drug prevention campaigns. The council will 
end 1993 with 22 million [cruzeiros] in cash that it has 
collected from the auctioning off of property confiscated from 
the drug traffic and from payments by agencies preparing 
educational campaigns with money obtained through budget 
amendments submitted by congressmen. 
  The shortage of funds has led the council's president, Isaac 
Barreto, to reject practically all requests to finance video 
clips, since the budget has been too tight to produce even one. 
The advertising campaigns against drug use in the Federal 
District and the states of Rio de Janeiro, Rondonia, and Parana 
were produced with funds obtained by congressmen through budget 
amendments. 
  Confen has distributed social subsidies totaling 39.7 
million 
cruzeiros (at April values) to 120 welfare agencies, most of 
them therapy groups. To gain access to those subsidies this 
year, the institutions will have to submit a new statement of 
assets to the National Social Welfare Council, an agency of the 
Ministry of Health. The reason is that the council does not want 
to run the risk of handing out money to agencies that are 
cheating the federal administration. 
  Despite the shortage of money, something unprecedented 
happened this year at Confen. Four institutions linked to 
congressmen, including one institute belonging to Federal Deputy 
Raquel Candido (no party, Rondonia), returned about 11 million 
cruzeiros that had not been used in the prevention campaigns. 
<H5>  Secretariat Will Support Council </H5>
  The National Narcotics Secretariat, which was recently 
approved by President Itamar Franco, is going to help the 
National Council on Narcotics (Confen) implement national policy 
in that area. Auctions of property seized from drug traffickers 
will be held by the secretariat, which will also administer the 
money collected in that way. 
  At the beginning of December, Confen held a meeting to 
prepare for the one that will be held in January. Its purpose 
was to decide how to spend the small amount of funds available. 
The council's president, Isaac Barreto, said that the work of 
preventing drug use would continue to occupy a prominent place 
through the encouragement of regional campaigns like those 
organized in the Federal District, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, and 
Rondonia. The National Narcotics Secretariat will be given the 
funds from the Fund for Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Combat 
Against Drugs (Funcab) that currently belong to Confen. Funcab's 
funds consist of federal appropriations, gifts from domestic and 
international agencies, auction proceeds, and the proceeds of 
fines levied in connection with the control and supervision of 
controlled drugs and medicines and of chemicals used to 
manufacture and process drugs. 
  Funcab's entire budget for 1994 will be devoted to programs 
to provide vocational training concerned with education, 
prevention, treatment, repression, control, and supervision in 
connection with drug use and drug trafficking. Carrying out 
campaigns and modernizing repression activities will also be 
priority activities for the new secretariat. Forty percent of 
Funcab's funds will go to the Federal Police. 
  The National Narcotics Secretariat will have a slim 
structure, with only two departments and nine commissioned 
positions. Still to be named is its secretary, who will face 
strong resistance on the part of the Federal Police. Sectors in 
the Federal Police believe that the new agency is going to 
dilute the duties currently assigned to that police force.

<F P=106> [Article: "PF Seizes 51 Kilos of Cocaine Paste"] </F>
  [Text] The Federal District Regional Superintendency of the 
Federal Police Department [DPF] yesterday reported the results 
of the work done by the Drug Enforcement Headquarters to seize 
51 kg of coca base and a number of packages of the starch that 
is used to adulterate--"step on"--the drug. Adulteration 
increases the weight of the drug and, consequently, its value. 
The seizure took place on the ranch owned by trafficker Antonio 
Alde Paiva ("Chimarrao"), who got away. The ranch is located 
near the municipality of Santo Antonio do Descoberto in Goias. 
Three traffickers were arrested. 
  Investigation of the trafficker intensified when Federal 
Police agents obtained information that Antonio Alves--a 
trafficker well known to the DPF--would be receiving a large 
shipment of cocaine from Bolivia. The Federal Police discovered 
that "Chimarrao" owned some rural property in the municipality 
of Santo Antonio do Descoberto on the banks of the Areias River 
and that the drugs would probably be hidden there. By 
maintaining surveillance on the trafficker, police were able to 
dismantle part of that drug connection by arresting three 
members of the gang. 
  During their investigation, the Federal Police learned that 
"Chimarrao" had frequent contacts in Goiania, Cuiaba, and 
Abadiania in Goias. It was discovered that Edison de Abreu Gama, 
Agenor Jose Alves, and Jose Lima Rodrigues had arrived in 
Abadiania with some large casks, and that was when the Federal 
Police Superintendency in the Federal District decided to start 
its operation. 
  Arrest--The DPF agents arrested Edison de Abreu Gama, Agenor 
Jose Alves, and Jose Lima Rodrigues at Kilometer 13 on Highway 
BR-060. They were in a white Niva automobile with Sao Paulo 
license number SZ-4772. Found in the vehicle were a radio 
communications set and a .38 caliber revolver. The three men 
confessed that they had left the drugs on the side of Highway 
BR-060 near Abadiania, the place where they had been the night 
before. 
  Carrying a search and arrest warrant and aided by 
drug-sniffing dogs, the federal agents were able to seize not 
only the drugs but also three shotguns, eight cartridges, and a 
number of blank documents--dummies for printing--belonging to 
the Federal District Traffic Department. The seizure occurred at 
the home of "Chimarrao," who owns the ranch alongside Highway 
BR-060. 
  After the drugs were seized, Agenor confessed that his job 
in 
the gang was to accompany a truck driver named Mauro to the town 
of Abadiania and that the drugs were taken from a false bottom 
in the fuel tank of a truck--the license number of which is 
being kept secret by the Federal Police so as not to jeopardize 
the rest of the investigation that is now under way. Agenor also 
said that seven days earlier, he had brought 35 kg of coca base 
to "Chimarrao," who is a now a fugitive. 
  Edison de Abreu Gama was the escort while the drug was being 
transported--that is, he drove ahead of the truck in the car 
with the radio set so as to warn truck driver Mauro of possible 
problems. The gang members were arrested and are being held at 
the DPF jail in the Federal District, where they have been 
charged with the commission of a crime under Article 12 of Law 
No. 6368.

  [Text] George Town, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, Jan 30, 
CANA -- The Cayman Islands have become a major trans-shipment 
point for drugs headed to North America, Police Commissioner 
Alan Ratcliffe and drugs squad superintendent, Trevor Cutts, 
have reported. 
  Speaking at a press conference where they discussed this 
normally quiet British territory's 7.8 percent increase in crime 
from 1992, Ratcliffe said, "There is evidence drugs are shipped 
here to go to north. Some do find the local market but it's 
impossible that all seized drugs are for the domestic market." 
  Ratcliffe said the 4,330 pounds of marijuana and 52 pounds 
of 
cocaine seized by police in 1992 would represent a major 
consumption by all of the islands 27, 000 residents if it stayed 
in the Cayman Islands. 
  He said he believed the amounts seized represent only 10 
percent of all drugs reaching the Cayman Islands. And he added 
these figures were only what police seized, not what customs 
officers confiscated in 1993. 1993 customs seizures were not 
available. 
  Cutts said Cayman "is like a giant warehouse" for the 
trans-shipment of drugs from Jamaica and Honduras. He said most 
of the marijuana and cocaine come in boats under cover of night. 
  The Cayman Islands has no coast guard or navy and only one 
police patrol boat for approxiamately 300 miles of coast line. 
Ratcliffe said the 7.8-percent rise in crime was directly 
attributable to drug arrests and offences. 
  "There is evidence there are far more drugs on Grand Cayman 
than have ever been here before," he said. Drug-related arrests 
jumped from 606 in 1992 to 894 in 1993, a rise of 47.5 percent. 
There were 3,298 crime reports in 1993 compared with 3058 in 
1993, Ratcliffe said. 
  The number of burglaries in the territory fell in 1993 from 
765 to 680. The solution rate on those crimes was 36 percent, up 
12 percent from 1992, said Ratcliffe. 
  Drugs are an increasing problem in the Cayman Islands. A 
local high court judge recently said 80 percent of all inmates 
at the local prison were convicted on drug or drug related 
offences. 
  Ratcliffe said he believed more than 80 percent of property 
crimes--burglary and theft--were done to obtain property or 
money to trade for drugs. 
  For 1994, Cayman has already had its first ever armed 
robbery 
of a tourist. Two local men have been arrested in connection 
with the incident and are currently awaiting trial.

  [Text] Police seized in Arica 52 kg of cocaine today, the 
largest shipment seized so far this year. The drug was to be 
distributed in the main resort areas of northern and central 
Chile. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] The drug was 
detected by police in the high plateau region when it was being 
brought into the country by two Bolivian drug traffickers who 
had been followed by investigative police for the last two 
weeks. The drug traffickers are cousins David Encina and Jose 
Encina. They brought the drug in knapsacks adapted for the long 
walk from Cochabamba. Narcotics agents said the 52 kg of cocaine 
were to be distributed outside the Arica region too. 
  [Narcotics agent Jose Miguel Vallejos] The drug was also 
going to be distributed in the Fourth Region, where cocaine is 
being sold to foreign tourists, and the Fifth Region. 
  [Reporter] Vallejo said this shipment of cocaine is the most 
important seized so far this year, equal to 263,000 doses of 
cocaine. Police have seized 94 kg of cocaine so far this month, 
double the amount seized during the same period last year. [end

  [Text] [EL TIEMPO] The Council of State, through its new 
president, Magistrate Amado Gutierrez Velasquez, sent you a 
letter on Wednesday 19 January in which it requested information 
regarding the constitutional and legal reasons behind the 
presence of U.S. troops in different parts of our country. Is 
the president willing to give out that information? 
  [Gaviria] More than that. I have given instructions for the 
Defense Ministry to give out all the information it has on the 
temporary presence of U.S. troops in the country. The 
government is willing, as it has always been, to fully cooperate 
with the Council of State, not only by turning over documents 
but also by making the necessary explanations to clear up this 
matter. 
  [EL TIEMPO] As for the presence of U.S. troops in Juanchaco, 
why did the government not ask the Senate or the Council of 
State for authorization as the National Constitution requires? 
  [Gaviria] It is clear that the government believes the 
presence of U.S. troops or those of other countries that enter 
Colombian territory to provide technical and training assistance 
and that observe international agreements does not violate the 
Constitution. 
  The legal base for this type of exercise is the 
Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty (TIAR) which is 
currently in effect. It was signed by Colombia and approved by 
the Congress of the Republic in 1947. This treaty was followed 
by the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement signed on 17 April 
1952. These types of military missions are carried out in 
Colombia based on legal documents that have been in effect since 
the middle of the century. 
  As for the joint military engineering exercise taking place 
in Juanchaco--in which neither military personnel [as published] 
nor warships are participating--there is a memorandum of 
understanding and an agreement signed by Defense Minister Rafael 
Pardo and U.S. Ambassador Morris Busby on 29 October 1993. 
These instruments lie within the framework of, among others, 
the TIAR. They specify that the missions will be joint military 
engineering exercises for training purposes, which will lead to 
the construction of various projects for community use. Other 
similar agreements exist. One of them has to do with the 
exchange of military personnel, another has to do with the 
integration of the radar network located in the Caribbean, and 
another is aimed at expanding the naval river fleet. 
  Moreover, within the same framework of the TIAR, there have 
been various joint exercises with military units from various 
Latin American countries. We can mention the well-known naval 
operations called Unitas, 34 of which have already been held. 
They have been held every year since 1959 in Colombian 
territorial waters, as well as in other countries. Naval units 
from various countries are trained with regard to the joint 
procedures that would be followed in case of an attack from 
outside the continent. A landing exercise has taken place each 
year since 1962 at a place known as La Cangrejera on the 
Atlantic coast. In 1983 two exercises took place: one in Tumaco 
and another in San Andres. In 1991 and 1992 exercises took 
place in the vicinity of the Bahia Malaga Naval Base. They were 
joint exercises with the participation of U.S. and Colombian 
soldiers among others. 
  Therefore, by virtue of the fact that at the time TIAR was 
approved by the Congress, the Defense Ministry, and all 
exercises have been carried out on these same legal assumptions 
and never has anyone objected, I do not consider it necessary to 
request authorization from the Senate, or request the opinion of 
the Council of State, or inform any other authority, the same 
way it was not done in the past with Unitas and other similar 
exercises. 
  [EL TIEMPO] But do you believe Mr. President that the 
country 
is so naive as to believe that 150 men from the United States 
are needed to build a small school? 
  [Gaviria] Of course not; all these projects can be done by 
the Colombian State. But here lies the mistake. These 
gentlemen are military engineers and have come here to carry out 
joint exercises with Colombian military forces. The idea is to 
teach and practice, to share technical experiences, to solve 
logistical and communications problems, which eventually our men 
would meet in a situation of war. Instead of expending energy 
building or making useless things, they dedicate their energy to 
civic and solidarity objectives. The idea is to take advantage 
of the joint military engineering training and at the same time 
benefit the area and the community. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Does the presence of U.S. soldiers in Juanchaco 
violate Colombian sovereignty? 
  [Gaviria] The president does not see it that way. The U.S. 
military engineers are in an area totally under the control of 
the Colombian Navy and carry out their work under the 
supervision of the Armed Forces. I must also insist that the 
presence of military missions, doing civilian work, is covered 
by international agreements that are currently in force. 
  The problem is that many stories have been weaved around 
this. In fact, the EL TIEMPO Sunday edition highlighted the lies 
that have been used to attack the people's good faith. I have 
even heard that a U.S. base will be built in Juanchaco to 
replace the ones in Panama, or worse yet, that a new 
transoceanic canal is being designed. Good gracious! One needs 
to be very naive or very ill-intentioned to spread stories such 
as these that make no sense. 
  All this uproar leads me to wonder that once studies are 
completed, which both the Council of State and the Prosecutor 
General's Office are doing, the country must reflect and decide 
whether or not it wants this type of assistance in the future. 
My personal opinion is that if one believes that this type of 
assistance is an affront to our sovereignty, one is closing the 
door on something that is basic to making our Armed Forces more 
professional. Not only that, but we would end cooperation, 
equipment supply, maintenance, and intelligence that allow us to 
fight crime. 
  [EL TIEMPO] President, but Juanchaco is not the only case. 
What were the U.S. planes that overflew Barranquilla this 
weekend up to? 
  [Gaviria] According to what the Military Forces General 
Command and the FAC [Colombian Air Force] reported to me, the 
weekend Barranquilla overflights had been legally authorized 
earlier. The Civil Aeronautics Board, through the Directorate 
of Air Operations, had information on the Atlantic coast areas 
that this type of aircraft was going to overfly. 
  Colombia, in its fight against drug trafficking, receives 
support from the United States and other countries. We do not 
have all the equipment or the required technology to support 
with technical intelligence the struggle against drug 
trafficking. On the basis of current agreements that seek to 
repress illegal drug trafficking, the Defense Ministry requests, 
when conditions warrant, the support of U.S. planes that are 
specially equipped to detect airplanes that have not filed a 
flight plan. It is worth mentioning that overflights by U.S. 
airplanes are authorized by Decree No. 1692 of 1992. The 
overflights are to inform the Colombian authorities on the 
presence of unauthorized planes and that any other measure, such 
as chasing these airplanes, is exclusively the responsibility of 
the FAC and other national authorities. 
  You might be asking yourselves why the air traffic 
controllers did not know? Because there are ongoing 
investigations of air controllers involved in drug trafficking. 
There are also people who are interested in stirring up false 
sovereignty debates, encouraged by a dark sponsor. 
  If we are concerned about defending our air space 
sovereignty, the true threat does not lie in joint operations 
with the help of friendly countries. Danger to sovereignty, to 
Colombian society, and air security arise with the hundreds of 
illegal flights, without flight plans, and with perverse 
motivations, carried out by gun runners and drug traffickers 
over our territory. The authorized overflights are precisely an 
act of sovereignty to prevent our air space from being used with 
impunity by Colombia's true enemies. 
  [EL TIEMPO] How many air surveillance radars has the United 
States installed in Colombia? Who operates them and who uses the 
information they collect? 
  [Gaviria] Currently, the United States has installed four 
radars. The locations, facilities, and equipment are under the 
command, operation, and responsibility of Colombian military 
authorities. Some operate with the technical assistance of U.S. 
civilian organizations, and others with the technical assistance 
of U.S. military personnel. The radars' purpose is precisely 
what I talked to you about earlier--that is, to use technical 
means to enforce control, surveillance, and sovereignty. The 
information gathered is at the disposal of the Colombian Armed 
Forces, which uses it to plan operations. Colombia has always 
pressed the international community to obtain more equipment, 
which serves to enhance our intelligence work. I wish we had 
more radars and more technical assistance in these matters. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Some days ago, you said the U.S. military 
operation in Juanchaco was "humanitarian" in nature. Do you 
still feel that way? 
  [Gaviria] To be precise, I would be more accurate to talk of 
it as a solidarity or civic operation. I feel that building a 
hospital or a school, like the U.S. military engineers are 
doing, as a by-product of the joint exercise is a task that 
entails goodwill, and as the Juanchaco residents have said, it 
benefits the people of the zone where it occurs. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Is there any relation between the war against 
the 
Cali Cartel and the Juanchaco operation? Do the military 
operations in Juanchaco include building and operating radio 
beacons that seek to control drug trafficking? 
  [Gaviria] I believe I have stated with sufficient clarity 
that the Juanchaco activities, which stem from the memoranda of 
agreement and understanding signed between Defense Minister 
Rafael Pardo and U.S. Ambassador Busby, have no other purpose 
than the one announced: the joint implementation of military 
engineering projects based on reciprocal assistance treaties. 
Moreover, in view of the evident needs of the people of that 
area of the country, the Defense Ministry and the Valle 
Department Governor's Office signed a contract last December to 
build a landing strip in Juanchaco. The Codazzi Military 
Engineers Battalion is implementing that project. Although this 
project is being carried out simultaneously with the ones 
mentioned earlier, it has no connection with the project the 
U.S. soldiers are implementing. 
  All of this falls within the framework of the Colombian 
Constitution and laws. Some people, who are doubtful, have 
legitimate concerns. Others, who vehemently defend the notion of 
a U.S. invasion, are espousing a false nationalism that comes 
from bad information or shady interests. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Why have there been so many contradictions, so 
much secrecy, so much mystery in the handling of this case? 
  [Gaviria] No. There has not been any of that. From the 
start, 
I reported the activities going on in Juanchaco. If you compare 
the information the government issued in December to current 
information, it is exactly the same. The public is aware of the 
scope of the operation. Armed Forces officers have been ready to 
speak with reporters, and some reporters have even visited the 
site. As I said, I think it is legitimate that doubts and 
questions are expressed at political and public opinion levels, 
and the government has the obligation to answer them. I also 
think, however, the country is the victim of an exacerbated and 
ill-intended distortion of events. I am not ruling out the 
existence of a misinformation campaign aimed at creating 
sentiment against international cooperation in the struggle 
against drug trafficking. 
  In the past, drug traffickers have manipulated a false sense 
of nationalism to undermine the nation's purpose of ridding 
itself from the slavery that criminal organizations have tried 
to impose on it. We cannot be stooges for those who hide behind 
our flag to evade the law and protect their illicit businesses. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Last week's issue of SEMANA referred to a 
conversation with Prosecutor Gustavo de Greiff and U.S. Attorney 
General Janet Reno, in which the possibility of pardoning the 
members of the Cali Cartel was mentioned. How do you feel about 
it? 
  [Gaviria] Regarding your question, the country knows we are 
studying the topic either through consultations between 
presidents or contacts the foreign minister has made. We will 
make a decision at an opportune time. A decision will respond to 
the interests of Colombia and America. 
  Concerning the private conversation between the prosecutor 
general and Ms. Reno, I must inform you that the information I 
have is quite different from that published in the weekly in 
question. Never, for example, was there any mention of the word 
pardon. A pardon is a moral and legal impossibility of which 
neither the president nor the prosecutor could approve under any 
circumstance. 
  For obvious reasons the president of the Republic cannot 
expand on the issues discussed in that private meeting, but he 
is convinced that the terms of the conversation differ from the 
reports that were published. 
  What must be stressed is that after that conversation 
Prosecutor General De Greiff and the U.S. Justice Department 
managed to settle most of the differences that had emerged 
during the process of legal cooperation, whereby the proof 
gathered in the United States against drug traffickers was 
collected for the Colombian courts. 
  Nevertheless, because I am already discussing this topic, 
allow me to tell you that the president of the Republic has a 
high opinion of the prosecutor general, who has become one of 
the moral pillars of our society. With his legal wisdom and 
administrative skills he has built the Prosecutor General's 
Office, which was created by the 1991 Constitution to establish 
system of litigation in our country. 
  Moreover, he has done much more than this. He has bravely 
confronted the threats of criminals who see in the prosecutor 
general a respresentative of Colombians who refused to allow 
themselves to be defeated and were not frightened by the 
onslaught of violence. The prosecutor works shoulder to 
shoulder with the president of the Republic and his staff to 
develop and consolidate policies, such as the policy of 
submission to justice, which has allowed a tangible reduction of 
the terrorist phenomena associated with drug trafficking. More 
recently, the prosecutor has made progress in bringing to trial, 
sentencing, and jailing several criminals. 
  Of course, there have been times when we held different 
points of view--in short, different opinions concerning the way 
to handle particular cases. Because of the good relationship 
that exists between the president and the prosecutor, and 
because of the need, which is acknowledged by everyone, to work 
as a team, these differences have been eliminated for the good 
of the country. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Are the differences the public perceives between 
the Presidency and the Attorney General's Office concerning the 
surrender process for the Cali Cartel real or imagined? 
  [Gaviria] They are normal within the sphere of 
responsibility of each of the institutions. The Attorney 
General's Office, on one hand, strictly fulfills the dictates of 
the Penal Code as it pertains to the rights of defendants. The 
government, on the other hand, also insists on implementing 
strict penalties and on granting the necessary guarantees of 
security to those people who surrender to justice. 
  I believe I share the prosecutor's views concerning the drug 
lords' eventual surrender to justice. Moreover, if one member 
of the drug trafficking hierarchy wants to adhere to this 
policy, he must be sent to a top security jail. Also, if he 
wants to obtain from the government the implicit benefits of the 
submission policy, he must cooperate with the authorities and 
confess. 
  [EL TIEMPO] The way these drug traffickers are being held in 
custody seems to be one of the reasons for disagreement. To 
what extent is the government's severity due to what could be 
described as "La Catedral Syndrome" [reference to Envigado 
maximum security prison in Medellin, also known as La Catedral, 
considered to be one of the most secure prisons in Latin 
America]? 
  [Gaviria] The government has learned from past experiences, 
good and bad. In turn, the government must make sure that 
members of society who surrender to the authorities do not mock 
the administration of justice. The only way to control eventual 
abuses is to keep the inmates in high security prisons, 
protecting their rights and giving them all proper guarantees, 
but also having them do their duties as inmates. 
  [EL TIEMPO] The U.S. Government reportedly has made 
statements and applied pressure regarding the Cali Cartel. It 
has also been said that a certain indulgence of yours toward 
Washington is linked to your campaign for the post of OAS 
secretary general. What have you to say about this? 
  [Gaviria] The United States is not the only one that wants 
us 
to work with the same zeal with which we defeated the now 
virtually extinct Medellin Cartel. Colombian society is also 
committed to this effort, with or without the international 
community's requests. Colombia must continue to firmly combat 
drug trafficking. Colombia must wage a life-or-death struggle 
against drug trafficking with tools such as surrender. I am 
firmly determined to maintain this policy. I have stood firmly 
against drug trafficking throughout my public life, when I was a 
congressman, during my campaign for president, when I took up 
Luis Carlos Galan's banner, and as president of the Republic. 
The suggestion that the president of the Republic's view of 
this problem is influenced by Cesar Gaviria's eventually running 
as candidate for the post of OAS secretary general is evil and 
ill-intentioned. The country is familiar with my position 
regarding drug trafficking. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Behind the probable surrender of the topmost 
leaders of the Cali Cartel and other drug trafficking 
organizations lies the offer of those who control a large part 
of the drug supply to the United States to dismantle the 
business. Apart from putting a few drug traffickers behind bars, 
is it not important for the government to dismantle a business, 
whose profits can run in the millions, and the country's most 
complex criminal organization? 
  [Gaviria] It is the duty of this government, the Prosecutor 
General's Office, and the Attorney General's Office to find a 
good judicial solution to break impunity and to have the leaders 
of criminal organizations cooperate with justice, go to prison, 
and serve sentences that serve as deterrents. If, in addition, 
their illegal activities are dismantled, I am sure the Attorney 
General's Office can negotiate sentences in accordance with the 
Penal Procedure Code. 
  In due time, the Prosecutor General's Office itself will be 
able to assess the cooperation of those who submit themselves to 
justice. This policy must be accompanied by the combined actions 
of the intelligence services, the public forces, the Prosecutor 
General's Office, and the Attorney General's Office against 
criminal organizations--actions that will make it possible to 
dismantle their illegal activities and build up legally sound 
cases. 
  I want to go further, however. It must be crystal clear to 
the country that it is impossible to coexist with the mafias, 
either those that perpetrate terrorist actions or those that 
hide beneath a peaceful appearance. Every Colombian must be 
watchful to prevent a climate of relative complacency toward 
drug trafficking from leading us to painful situations like the 
ones we experienced in the past. I am sure this view is shared 
by the Prosecutor General and the Attorney General. Our shared 
objective is to rid Colombia of the criminal drug trafficking 
organizations. 
  [EL TIEMPO] In Thursday's "Counterescape" column, and in 
relation to the attempt on the finance minister's life and 
renewed guerrilla activity, journalist Enrique Santos Calderon 
questioned the military intelligence services' efficiency and 
the Armed Forces' capability to counter these attacks. What do 
you have to say about this? 
  [Gaviria] The Armed Forces have substantially improved their 
ability to deal with organized crime. In fact, we can say 
Colombian society and the Armed Forces are on the offensive and 
have been defeating subversion and violence. 
  A great effort has been made to improve the operational 
facilities of the Army and the police. Their numbers have been 
increased, and their members have become more professional and 
been given better equipment. In addition, the resources at the 
disposal of the state's security and intelligence services have 
increased in number and been reinforced. The results have been 
overwhelming. The guerrillas' military actions have decreased in 
number, their power to undermine the national wealth has 
decreased, and the number of kidnappings have decreased, among 
other significant variations in the guerrillas' behavior. 
  The dismantling of the Escobar cartel and the elimination of 
its leader, the world's most notorious criminal and drug 
trafficker, demonstrate the Colombian Armed Forces' ability to 
deal with organized crime. 
  As a result of the public force's permanent activities and 
the results obtained in the struggle against subversion, 
subversive organizations have been perpetrating terrorist 
actions to cast a false image of their armed power. In 
addition, in view of their complete political isolation, in this 
pre-electoral time they can do nothing other than perpetrate 
terrorist actions to make themselves known as an active 
organization. Nevertheless, and despite the serious events of 
this week, the guerrillas are clearly losing their emphasis on 
politics, and their actions are becoming more and more like 
those of a mafia or organized crime. 
  The attempt on the finance minister's life and the use of 
terrorism indicate the guerrillas' military weakness. We 
coincide with columnist Santos Calderon in that, to deal with 
these people in this new way, it is mandatory to keep 
reinforcing the intelligence services' work and, of course, to 
seek greater support for the authorities among the people. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Mr. President, when will the candidacy for the 
OAS secretary general be decided? 
  [Gaviria] Colombia's eventual candidacy for the OAS 
secretary 
general must be explained as a consequence of the reality of our 
international relations and our incorporation into the world 
community of nations, not as an expression of a president's 
personal aspiration. 
  As for your question, we are considering the subject, either 
through consultations among presidents or the foreign ministers' 
contacts, and the country knows this. We will make a decision 
when the times comes. Such a decision will respond to the 
interests of Colombia and all of America.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Antonio Urdinola: "The Wealth of the </F>
Colombian Mafia"] 
  [Text] Nearly all the studies made regarding the drug 
traffic's economic impact on Colombia have been focused on the 
issue of the foreign currency entering the country through that 
activity, and its effects on monetary management and the balance 
of payments. Nevertheless, these criteria are insufficient for 
assessing the real dimensions of the business and, hence, its 
social and economic implications. 
  Last week, it was stated in this column that drug 
traffickers 
are currently accumulating assets in Colombia at an annual rate 
of approximately $2.5 billion. This figure was reached through a 
series of rather elementary considerations. In the first place, 
it is well known that most of the contraband entering the 
country is financed with Mafia dollars. It is paid for in pesos 
once the merchandise has been sold. The same device is used in 
the case of underbilling imports, especially consumer goods. 
  It has been estimated very conservatively that, for every 
$4.00 worth of legal imports, another dollar is now entering 
through contraband or underbilling, taking advantage of the 
indiscriminate commercial openness practiced by this 
administration. This means that, through such expedients, drug 
traffickers are accruing income in the country that could be 
estimated at $1.5 billion per year. 
  To be added to this are the dollars of illegal origin 
arriving as direct transfers from abroad, in banknotes from 
dealings such as fictitious tourism, or from overbilling of 
exports, which could amount to another $600 million annually. 
  Finally, we should remember that much of the acquisition of 
assets in the country is being done by drug traffickers through 
the purchase of properties paid for abroad. Through this device, 
large sums of illegal origin have been accumulated, and are in 
the hands of Colombian citizens completely dissociated from the 
drug business. 
  If we assume that the total value of the nation's material 
wealth (natural resources, including land, construction, and 
equipment) is four times the value of the GDP [gross domestic 
product], estimated at nearly $60 billion for 1993, we would 
find that, at the current rate, drug traffickers are acquiring 
one percent of that material wealth annually. Recalling that we 
have had 20 years of that business in Colombia, it does not seem 
absurd to think that the Mafia probably now owns 10 percent of 
the country's goods, as well as a similar volume abroad. The 
latter is disguised in a thousand different ways, through the 52 
notorious tax havens. 
  Fortunately for Colombia, that 10 percent of the national 
wealth is distributed among the 10 or 15 drug cartels, with 
their several thousand members. This causes the political power 
generated by that wealth to be established primarily on the 
regional level. 
  So long as drug consumption and trafficking continue to be 
illegal internationally, the Colombian drug traffickers will 
inevitably keep on accruing enormous earnings abroad. They will 
be brought into the country on a large scale if future 
governments do not change the extremely lax and indiscriminate 
commercial and exchange policies existing at present, and if tax 
amnesties as extensive as the previous ones continue to be 
enacted.

<F P=106> [Article by Camilo Chaparro; first paragraph is EL TIEMPO </F>
introduction] 
  [Text] In 12,000 early sentencing hearings, the 
prosecutor's office has sentenced nearly 9,000 people. Of those 
investigated, 60 percent were charged with crimes related to 
drug trafficking, terrorism, and kidnapping. 
  The Office of the Prosecutor General has developed legal 
procedures for the early termination of criminal proceedings and 
penalty negotiations, and in this way has put an end to crimes 
going unpunished and delays in nearly 9,000 investigations. 
  In just 18 months the Office of the Prosecutor General has 
held approximately 12,000 special early verdict hearings and has 
sentenced almost 9,000 accused persons. 
  According to Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose 
Sintura, the use of penalty negotiations is increasing, and is 
having a direct impact on unclogging the judicial backlog and 
preventing crimes from going unpunished. 
  Sintura told EL TIEMPO that even though most of the 
negotiations (60 percent of the hearings) were held for persons 
charged with crimes in the jurisdiction of regional or special 
prosecutors, the use of early verdict hearings is rising for 
ordinary crimes. 
  "Of the 12,000 early verdict hearings the Office of the 
Prosecutor General has held, most are related to crimes handled 
by regional judicial officials--drug trafficking, extortion, 
terrorism, homicide for the purposes of terrorism, and 
kidnapping--but we are also beginning to see a significant 
increase in the negotiation of penalties for ordinary crimes 
like petty theft, personal injuries, embezzlement, etc." 
  Only 30 percent of the 12,000 settlements of negotiated 
penalties reached in the last 18 months by regional or special 
prosecutors and sectional or ordinary prosecutors have been 
overturned by judges. 
  Sintura stated that negotiated settlements are rejected 
basically because of judges being overly legalistic. "For 
example, there are cases," he said, "in which a judge annuls a 
settlement reached between the accused and the prosecutor's 
office because a member of our staff forgot to list the penalty 
of a fine, which in any event is clearly stipulated in the law." 
  Sintura admits, though, that on other occasions prosecutors 
have made mistakes that lead judges to annul the settlements. 
"In some cases they do not properly support the charges, or they 
poorly describe the crime or seek inappropriate penalties," he 
added. 
  The deputy prosecutor general believes that with last 
November's reform of the Criminal Procedures Code, negotiated 
penalties are going to increase considerably, for now they will 
be easier to use. 
  "With these new amendments," said Sintura, "this type of 
settlement will be reached directly between the accused and the 
prosecutor. After the hearing a document will be sent to the 
judge so the judge can verify its legality. That will make the 
negotiations smoother, as the judge's intervention will not be 
as direct." 
  According to Sintura, the early verdict procedure has 
enabled 
society to convict a number of criminals against whom the state 
had no evidence. 
<H5>  The Ochoas and Urdinola </H5>
  Of the 12,000 hearings held by the Office of the Prosecutor 
General, the deputy prosecutor's office has handled the eight 
most sensitive cases. Sintura conducted the sentence negotiation 
procedures with Ivan Urdinola Grajales, Gonzalo Mejia Sanin, 
Fabio and Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez, and some others as well. 
  "In some of these cases we had no solid evidence, and if not 
for the criminals' confession, which grants them some benefits, 
it would not have been possible to win a conviction," said the 
official. 
  "This office has conducted eight early verdict hearings. The 
most difficult to date was Urdinola's case, as we knew that the 
automatic sentence reductions provided by the law would not let 
us put him away for many years, and second, because the evidence 
we had against this man was quite rudimentary," added Sintura. 
  Sintura says that the sentence of four years and seven 
months 
(the actual time) that Urdinola has to serve was "essentially 
based on his own confession and on some documents U.S. officials 
provided. If we had taken this case to court without his 
confession, we could not have gotten a verdict." 
  He explained that a negotiated penalty also offers the 
prosecutor's office the advantage of the possibility of 
conducting other investigations against persons with whom 
penalties are being or have been negotiated. 
  "We conduct very specific negotiations with very 
well-circumscribed charges so that we can pursue other 
investigations; for example, Jorge Luis and Fabio Ochoa 
confessed to cocaine trafficking between 1974 and 1990." 
  "If the prosecutor's office demonstrates that between 1991 
and 1993 they distributed more cocaine, we can bring another 
case against them that has nothing to do with the negotiated 
penalty," says Sintura. 
  "In Urdinola's case," he added, "charges and penalties were 
arranged for drug trafficking, and he was told that a homicide 
charge against him was not included in this negotiation." 
  "He obviously always wanted the homicide charge to be 
included in the negotiation. But the position of the Office of 
the Prosecutor General was clear: homicide charges were not 
negotiable unless he made a confession; as he did not confess to 
the homicide charges and claimed to be innocent, we are now 
moving forward with that case," said the deputy prosecutor 
general.

  [Text] Eduardo Luis Gonzalez, director of international 
affairs of the Secretariat for Drug Addiction Prevention of the 
Argentine Presidency, is in Cuba to discuss with members of the 
Cuban Committee Against Drug Trafficking the signing of an 
accord for the fight against drugs. This accord may be finalized 
within two months. 
  [Begin Gonzalez recording] I believe that it will be 
completed before the year is over. We expect to complete this 
accord in a couple of months. We are aware that Cuba does not 
have a drug problem on the scale of Argentina's but we believe 
it will be useful since the world is growing smaller; 
international tourism brings both advantages and disadvantages. 
The accord is a contribution we will like to fulfill. [end 
recording] 
  Cuba has signed similar agreements with 21 countries and the 
accord with the Argentine Presidency Secretariat for Drug 
Addiction Prevention and Fight Against Drug Trafficking is 
another effort of the Cuban Government to join international 
programs against drugs.

  [Text] Quito, 27 Jan (AFP) -- The United States has 
confirmed it "will do all that is necessary" to help Ecuador in 
its struggle against drug trafficking, Foreign Minister Diego 
Paredes reported today. He added that it was this fight that 
prompted guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia (FARC) to kill 11 Ecuadoran policemen and soldiers. 
  The Ecuadoran official announced that U.S. Secretary of 
State 
Warren Christopher sent a note to Ecuadoran President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen lamenting the death of the 11 uniformed men during 
a FARC ambush. The 11 men were involved in a narcotics 
operation in the area of the Putumayo River, at the Colombian 
border, in December 1993. 
  The U.S. Government "realizes these personnel were killed 
while courageously confronting and combating the threat of 
international drug trafficking, and it values the sacrifices 
made by the national government in this struggle," Christopher 
stated. 
  The note from the United States also "guarantees that its 
government will do everything it can to help Ecuador in this 
effort," Paredes pointed out. 
  The foreign minister added that Ecuador will not budge in 
its 
struggle against drug trafficking and terrorism through the 
application of the law without having second thoughts, and by 
respecting human rights and the country's institutional system.

  [Text] Quito, 27 Jan (AFP) -- Colombia's Cali Cartel has 
expanded its operations into Ecuador, Colonel Telmo Erazo, 
director of investigations and Interpol liaison for the 
Ecuadoran police, stated here today. According to Erazo, 
Colombian narcotraffickers are using Ecuador as a bridge to ship 
cocaine into the international market. 
  "There are clues that the cartel is exerting influence in 
our 
country, and we are working to combat this," Erazo told newsmen. 
  The head of the counternarcotics squad does not dismiss that 
after the death of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, head of the Medellin 
Cartel, Cali's criminal organization has gained control of the 
drug business worldwide. 
  DEA reports indicate that the Cali Cartel is supplied with 
Peruvian and Bolivian cocaine paste, which is later processed in 
laboratories located in jungle regions of southern Colombia, 
especially in the Putumayo region along the Ecuadoran border. 
  The organization is also conducting large money laundering 
operations in Ecuador and in Venezuela, Chile, and Argentina, 
according to police spokesmen. 
  Over the past few days Ecuadoran, authorities have seized 
cocaine paste and cocaine hydrochloride, which were camouflaged 
in shipments bound for the United States and Europe. Several 
Spanish passengers, as well as passengers of other 
nationalities, presumably linked with drug trafficking, have 
been arrested in operations staged at the Guayaquil and Quito 
international airports.

  [Text] Mexico City--The director of the Federal Judicial 
Police [PJF] counternarcotics division assigned to the National 
Institute To Combat Drugs, Jose Luis Lagunes Lopez, has been 
dismissed; and Carlos Santibanez Ramos, ex-general director of 
Interpol in Mexico, has been named to replace him. This 
announcement was made unofficially yesterday. 
  Although the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic] did not publicize the appointment of the new director, 
Lagunes Lopez held a long meeting yesterday with Jorge Tello 
Peon, commissioner of the National Institute To Combat Drugs. 
Upon its conclusion, he refused to make any statement. 
  The National Institute To Combat Drugs was created at the 
president's proposal on 17 June of this year. Its purpose is to 
curb drug use effectively, and to prevent Mexico from serving as 
the site of drug production or trafficking. 
  The agency replaced the Drug Control Planning Center created 
by the ex-attorney general, Ignacio Morales Lechuga, in June of 
last year. 
  Commander Emilio Islas Rangel was named as Santibanez 
Ramos's 
substitute at Interpol of Mexico, an appointment made official 
by the Attorney General's Office yesterday. 
  At the instruction of the attorney general of the republic, 
Jorge Carpizo, the assistant attorney for local offices and 
inspections, Mario Ruiz Massieu, administered the oath for the 
Interpol post to Islas Rangel. He had previously served as 
director of the PGR's Kidnapping Investigations Unit, a position 
now to be filled by Juan Jose Valdemar Escalona. 
  A PGR communique states: "Commander Islas Rangel's new 
appointment is an acknowledgment of his considerable merits in 
his previous position as director of the same institution's 
Kidnapping Investigations Unit, where he achieved great success 
in solving these crimes." 
  Islas Rangel previously served as security chief for the 
United States Ambassador to Mexico, and representative of the 
Secretariat of Government in Guanajuato. 
  The PGR reported that he was also deputy director of 
operations for the Judicial Police in Guanajuato, and 
coordinator of the Federal District Judicial Police northern 
zone.

  [Text] Federal District--Jorge Carpizo's disputes with 
members of the Federal Judicial Branch have exceeded the bounds 
of legality and entered the realm of confrontation. 
  Such was his reaction to the decisions of a couple of judges 
and a magistrate who considered bills of indictment submitted by 
the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] 
inadmissible. Claiming that these decisions had caused the 
release of "dangerous drug traffickers," Carpizo exploded, 
resorting to a verbal and even incriminating attack. 
  Also exhibiting alleged errors made by judges and 
magistrates 
in their action, he publicly accused them of "negating the PGR's 
efforts in the battle against drug traffic." 
  Within the next few days, the PGR will file an 
administrative 
complaint in the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) 
against Olga Sanchez Contreras, the third district judge of 
criminal proceedings, for having released two presumed 
participants in the 24 November shooting at the Ochoa Bali-Hai 
restaurant. The judge maintained that the PGR is attempting to 
conceal its own mistakes by accusing the Judicial Branch. 
  She declared that, in fact, the PGR has compiled its 
preliminary investigations poorly, and that its charges are 
groundless. 
  The clashes between Jorge Carpizo, head of the Executive 
Branch's juridical division, and "certain" representatives of 
the Federal Judicial Branch, of which Carpizo was a member 
before joining the Executive Branch, are nothing new. 
  According to sources close to the PGR, during recent months 
it has been common practice for judges to refuse, or to declare 
themselves disqualified, to hear cases remanded by that 
department, particularly those associated with drug traffic. On 
other occasions, they have refrained from issuing arrest 
warrants or orders for the formal imprisonment of presumed 
criminals.

  [Text] Jorge Tello Peon, commissioner of the National 
Institute To Combat Drugs [INCD], revealed that high-ranking 
officials from that agency are conducting investigations 
throughout the country to locate "high crime areas," and thereby 
effectively attack organized crime. He announced the dispatch of 
15 special groups from the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] 
Narcotics Division to hunt and capture the drug trafficking 
"capos," so as to dismantle the drug dealing rings. 
  He added that those units, assigned primarily to the 
northern 
part of the country, consist of 40 graduates of the Training 
Institute run by the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic [PGR]. That department is backing their training to 
combat the "narcos" presumed to have connections with those in 
the United States and in Central and South America. 
  He claimed that the principal goals of those groups are to 
capture, among others, Benjamin, Javier, and Ramon Arellano 
Felix, the presumed material perpetrators of Cardinal Posadas 
Ocampo's assassination; Luis Hector Palma Salazar, alias "El 
Guero"; and Amado Carrillo Fuentes and Juan Garcia Abrego. There 
are apparently clues leading to these subjects, and "their 
operating methods are now known." 
  According to Tello Peon, the INCD's first commissioner, this 
year the activities of the agency headed by him will be 
consolidated. It has approximately 800 police agents trained in 
63 subjects. The topics include antiterrorism, constitutional 
law and, particularly, respect for human rights and guarantees. 
  He added that the graduates have been prepared also for air, 
land, and sea interception, noting that the training in 
investigation is to be reinforced this year. 
  An effort has been made to devise data processing and 
communication systems, and to obtain equipment and technology. 
The high-ranking commissioner also claimed that great progress 
has been made in locating crime areas, indicating that the 
narcotics agents' effort would be focused on these areas. 
  He added that the police agents and those from the Federal 
Public Prosecutor's Office assigned to the INCD would work 
jointly and cooperatively with the PGR's circuit 
representatives, and with military, state, and municipal 
authorities. 
  He observed that, last year, the Attorney General's Office, 
specifically, the Federal Judicial Police, headed by Rodolfo 
Leon Aragon, confiscated over 44 tons of cocaine base, and made 
"arrests of prominent persons associated with the drug traffic." 
He remarked that "members of the INCD also participated in these 
operations."

  [Text] Fewer than 48 hours after having regained his 
freedom, and at the request of the United States Embassy in 
Mexico, Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents recaptured the 
Spanish drug trafficker, Jose Luis Sierra Rodriguez, a Cali 
Cartel member, in Mexico City. He could be turned over to U.S. 
authorities within the next few days, to be tried for crimes 
against health and for the laundering of money originating in 
narcotics sales. 
  The PGR [Office of the Attorney General of the Republic] 
stressed: "Sierra Rodriguez's capture, based on a provisional 
arrest warrant for extradition purposes, represents a highly 
significant achievement in the battle against the drug traffic. 
This is particularly true because information has been inferred 
from this subject's statements making it possible to capture 10 
members of his organization in Ecuador, as well as several drug 
dealers in the United States." 
  It added that the Spaniard, whose criminal organization is 
headed by the Colombian, Antonio Bermudez and operates in 
Mexico, as well as in Colombia, Ecuador, and the neighboring 
country to the north, was first apprehended in Cancun, Quintana 
Roo. Although over a ton of cocaine base was seized from him in 
that town, a Campeche State federal judge released him two days 
later. 
  The PGR explained that on 18 December of last year, Sierra 
Rodriguez and four other persons, including these two 
Colombians, were captured in Cancun because of their connections 
with the smuggling of narcotics (cocaine) into the country. 
Although there was evidence attesting to the Spaniard's presumed 
guilt, the second district court of criminal proceedings in 
Campeche State freed him. 
  Indicating that Sierra Rodriguez must answer for crimes 
against health, money laundering, and violation of the General 
Law on Population in our country, the PGR noted that he is 
wanted by the U.S. authorities, accused of crimes of drug 
trafficking and laundering funds from the marketing of drugs. He 
was using the name Luis Cohen for those purposes. 
  The PGR added: "When the foregoing information was 
confirmed, 
the U.S. Embassy in Mexico requested this subject's extradition 
through official channels. As a result, the pertinent order for 
his provisional arrest for extradition purposes was sought from 
the Eighth District Court of Criminal Proceedings in the Federal 
District. It was granted and implemented by the Federal Judicial 
Police," under orders from Commander Adrian Carrera Fuentes. 
  On the same occasion, the institution emphasized that the 
capture of the Spaniard and the other members of Antonio 
Bermudez's ring by personnel from the PJF operational 
directorate, headed by Commander Victor Patino Esquivel, is one 
of the most severe blows dealt to the international drug 
traffic. It indicated that its battle against this social cancer 
will have to be intensified.

  [Excerpt] During an operation carried out in Guanajuato 
State, Federal Judicial Police forces seized 255 kg of cocaine 
base, with a commercial value of over 600 million new pesos on 
the drug black market. The narcotic was discovered in special 
compartments of a transformer stored in the packing department 
of a well-known freight shipping company. 
  In making the foregoing announcement, the Office of the 
Attorney General of the Republic added that the consignees of 
the drugs would soon be arrested. It is believed that this will 
have ramifications on the country's northern border, because the 
alkaloid presumably was to be sent to a construction firm with 
headquarters in that area. It was intended for subsequent 
shipment to the United States for sale and consumption. [passage

  [Excerpt] Through detection, reconnaissance, and inspection 
flights, Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents, campaign 
personnel, and the air team from the Office of the Attorney 
General of the Republic [PGR] discovered 25 marijuana and poppy 
plantations in Sinaloa State yesterday, on an area of 
approximately 200,000 square meters. There, over 900,000 of 
those drug plants were destroyed manually and through 
incineration and fumigation. It was noted that no incidents nor 
confrontations occurred between the criminals and 
representatives of the law during the operations. 
  According to reports provided by the PGR, the destruction of 
22 cannabis indica plantations, and three poppy plantations 
(from which opium gum is obtained) took place in the 
municipalities of Culiacan, Mocorito, Ocoroni, San Ignacio, and 
El Fuerte. The forces also confiscated fertilizers and several 
plastic bags containing large amounts of marijuana seed, also 
presumed to be for marketing. 
  The discovery and eradication of those crops, on an area of 
178,887 square meters, caused the criminals large financial 
losses, since all of them, including the poppy plants, were 
ready for harvesting. If that had occurred, the public poisoners 
would have accrued about 30 tons of drugs, as the investigating 
agents explained. 
  Based on the reports reaching the headquarters of the Office 
of the Attorney General of the Republic, it was learned that, on 
the banks of the Evora River in the municipality of Mocorito, 10 
drug crops (three consisting of poppies) were discovered on an 
area of 116,212 square meters. The authorities revealed: "There, 
the drug dealers had planted approximately 500,000 cannabis 
bushes and over 165,000 poppy plants. No incidents occurred 
during their destruction." 
  The report added that, through reconnaissance flights in the 
settlements of Salsipuedes and La Noria, in the municipality of 
Ocoroni, the forces managed to locate and destroy six more 
cannabis indica plantations, on an area of 2,773 square meters. 
On that site, over 11,000 bushes were incinerated. It indicated 
that, in the same locality, the federal agents deactivated a 
drug dryer, seizing fertilizer and seed of the same drug.

  [Text] Tomas Colsa McGregor, one of the most wanted drug 
traffickers, and an ex-assistant to the Arellano Felix brothers, 
was captured yesterday in Jalisco by agents from the Office of 
the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR]. The federal 
detectives also arrested four accomplices of the Arellano Felix 
brothers. 
  Through an operation concluding an exhaustive investigation, 
the elusive gangster was caught in a safe house located in the 
town of Zapopan, where he was hiding. When arrested, he had 360 
grams of cocaine in his possession. 
  According to the authorities themselves, Jalisco, Yucatan, 
Quintana Roo, and Sinaloa States were the main areas for this 
criminal group's activities. They stressed that the 
investigations are being continued to establish the 
ramifications of these activities, thought to extend not only to 
the United States, but also to Central and South America. 
  Based on Colsa McGregor's criminal record, he was engaged 
for 
several years in drug dealing operations with various 
organizations and individuals involved in that activity. The 
records underscore his links with the Arellano Felix brothers 
and, previously, with Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo himself, the 
drug "capo" currently confined at the high security prison of 
Almoloya de Juarez, Mexico State. 
  According to the PJF [Federal Judicial Police] report, after 
completing the investigation that uncovered the drug trafficker, 
they set up an operation resulting in his capture, through the 
respective search warrant for entering the premises where he was 
hiding. They were located at 41 Circuito de San Bernardino 
Street, in the Colinas de San Javier subdivision. 
  Also captured with Tomas Colsa McGregor were Jose Angulo 
Hernandez, Jesus Porfirio Diaz Medina, Sergio Edmundo Gomez 
Partida, and Salim Hamden Cano. All were placed at the disposal 
of the agent of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office. 
  The PGR announced that the investigation would be continued 
to probe the ramifications of the criminal organization headed 
by Tomas Colsa McGregor.

<F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz and Roberto Melendez] </F>
  [Text] Through special operations conducted in Campeche, 
Quintana Roo, and Yucatan States, Federal Judicial Police [PJF] 
agents captured 21 members of the Cali Cartel in the 
municipalities of Chetumal, Cancun, Escarcega, and Merida. This 
cartel is considered one of the world's most notorious criminal 
groups. Cocaine base worth over 3 billion new pesos was 
confiscated from those arrested. According to the Office of the 
Attorney General of the Republic [PGR], some of the drugs were 
found in special compartments of a bus, on the sides and front 
of which the mafiosi had affixed the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party [PRI] logo. 
  "The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic expects 
the (federal) judges to act according to law. The release of 
dangerous drug traffickers is detrimental to the country's 
interests," the department stressed. It noted that those now 
indicted, including one Spaniard and two Colombians, were 
members of the criminal organization headed by Antonio Bermudez, 
also a Colombian, residing in that country. The PGR added: 
"Bermudez was distributing large amounts of cocaine from 
southeastern Mexico, with the assistance of those now in 
custody." 
  The PGR categorically asserted that, with the arrest and 
remand of the 21 presumed drug dealers, "one of the leading drug 
trafficking organizations operating in the country" has been 
virtually disbanded. It also revealed that the investigation of 
the case is continuing, not only in the aforementioned 
federative states, but also in the northern part of the country. 
The mafiosi have been discovered to be connected with criminal 
groups operating in both Sinaloa and Baja California, as well as 
in the United States. 
  The department explained that, during the past few hours, in 
the city of Merida, Yucatan, federal agents, pursuing the 
investigation of the seizure of nearly 600 kg of pure cocaine in 
Campeche, succeeded in arresting nine presumed members of that 
criminal group. They had in their possession approximately 400 
kg more of the aforementioned alkaloid, which they had packed in 
199 "bricks." 
  According to the reports submitted by the PJF deputy 
representative in Yucatan, Dariela Zepeda Fuentes, to the 
force's general and operational directors, Adrian Carrera 
Fuentes and Victor Patino Esquivel, respectively, the drugs were 
concealed in special compartments of a bus to which the 
criminals had affixed the PRI emblems (to avoid being discovered 
and arrested). They add that it was a vehicle with Federal 
District registration, supposedly owned by the Autobuses de los 
Mochis Company, a firm that is now under investigation. 
  Those captured in Merida, Gustavo Adolfo Ayala Ramos, Jorge 
Alonso Uranga Paez, Manuel Olmeda Gutierrez, Luis Vega Rivas, 
Alberto Vega Rivas, Jorge Peraza Bernal, Jose Espinosa 
Dominguez, Cipriano Beltran Madueno, and Hernan Valdes Apodaca, 
made statements to the federal public prosecutor. They revealed 
that the shipment of cocaine, with a high degree of purity, was 
owned by the Cali Cartel, and was part of a larger consignment 
received several days earlier in the town of Chetumal, Quintana 
Roo. 
  They added that they had been instructed to take the drugs 
to 
the city of Culiacan, Sinaloa, for subsequent removal to 
Mexicali, Baja California. From that town, they were intended to 
be smuggled into the state of California, in the United States 
(to be "inserted in envelopes," sold, and consumed). This 
organization is presumed to have "contacts" there, as well as in 
other federative states of the country's northern region. 
  The federal agents also seized from the aforementioned 
subjects a pickup truck and a compact car, which were to be used 
to escort the bus. It was learned that there were no incidents 
nor confrontations between the police and the presumed drug 
traffickers during the operation, despite the sizable shipment 
intercepted. 
  Moreover, the department noted that, in another operation 
conducted during the special investigations, on 18 December, in 
the municipality of Escarcega, Campeche, Gilberto Eric Gomez 
Ortega, Felipe Corro Alcantara, Daniel Soto Vargas, and Antonio 
Reyes Cabanas were captured. They had concealed 600 kg of pure 
cocaine in 22 gas cylinders carried on a tank truck. The drugs 
were also presumed to be intended for shipment to the northern 
part of the country. 
  Based on these individuals' statements to the federal public 
prosecutor, those heading the investigations managed to capture 
Dionisio Reyes Cabanas, Gregorio Barradas Montero, and Antonio 
Ordonez Rodriguez in Chetumal, Quintana Roo. They had been 
assigned to receive the drug shipment worth many millions that 
was arriving from the island of San Andres, in Colombia. 
  Subsequently, in the town of Cancun, the authorities 
arrested 
the Mexicans, Benjamin Reyes Cabanas and Mario Fuentes Perez; as 
well as the Spaniard, Jose Luis Sierra Rodriguez, and the 
Colombians, Luis Carlos Pinto Camacho (alias "Ramiro Sierra 
Rodriguez") and Humberto Segundo Montenegro Freyre, who was also 
using the names Alberto Garcia Aleman or Alberto Rodriguez 
Garcia. The PGR confirmed the fact that "they are all members of 
the organization headed by Antonio Bermudez." 
  The department stressed: "In all cases, the agent from the 
Federal Public Prosecutor's Office completed the pertinent 
investigation and, within the constitutional period, both those 
implicated and the individuals using them to commit their crimes 
against health were placed at the disposal of the competent 
judge. The PGR is waiting for the judges to take action 
according to law."

<F P=106> [Report by Fabio Agrana] </F>
  [Text] Panama City, 20 Jan (EFE) -- Panamanian President 
Guillermo Endara told EFE that Panamanian authorities were 
informed and "indirectly" assisted Italian police in dismantling 
one of the main money laundering networks of the Cali Cartel. 
  However, the Panamanian head of state denied Italian reports 
that arrests were made in his country in connection with the 
"Unigold" operation, which on Wednesday destroyed a network that 
laundered $100 million monthly from the sale of Colombian 
cocaine in the United States through large amounts of gold sent 
to Panama. 
  In statements to EFE, Endara said that according to the 
security reports he has received, an international operation was 
conducted with the participation of Italian police, and although 
Panama "was not directly involved, it was kept informed of the 
situation by other agencies." 
  The cooperation, Endara added, was "at the level of 
information," which the Italians did not request directly but 
received through unidentified organizations. 
  Endara said he does not believe that these kinds of 
drug-related activities affect the international image of 
Panama, whose international banking system and Free Trade Zone 
have been considered by U.S. counternarcotics experts as "very 
vulnerable" to money laundering. 
  "This happens in all countries, and we always cooperate when 
asked," the president stressed. 
  According to reports by authorities, the network dismantled 
in Italy was led by Colombian citizen Gustavo Jesus Upegui 
Delgado, former accountant of late Medellin Cartel chief Pablo 
Escobar and currently one of the main financial leaders of the 
"Cali Cartel." Upegui has been arrested in Vicenza (northeast 
part of the country). Seven Italian businessmen were arrested in 
Vicenza and Arezzo on charges of participating in the money 
"laundering" network. 
  Reports from Italy said that four other unidentified people 
were arrested in Panama, but Endara asserted that no arrests had 
been made in his country in connection with the "Unigold" 
operation. 
  Italian authorities began the investigation last June after 
receiving a lead from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
(DEA). 
  According to reports from Italy, the dismantled gang used 
"narcodollars" to buy some 1,000 kg of gold bars per month, 
which were sent to Panama, where they were resold and the 
"laundered" money wired to the Cali Cartel in Colombia. 
  Alessandro Pansa, director of the operation and one of the 
individuals responsible for the Central Operation Center of 
Italy's Criminal Police, said in his country that the 
trafficking operations were so large that they threatened to 
alter the gold market. 
  Endara said that unlike other countries, Panama does not 
control the sale of gold, which "comes and goes without a 
problem." 
  Italian investigators identified three corporations, all 
based in Arezzo, as the owners of bank accounts where the 
"narcodollars" were sent. The corporations are Simar Joyeros 
Mayoristas, which has an outlet in Panama, Aurea Trading 
International, and Eurocatene. 
  Panamanian sources at Simar Joyeros Mayoristas told EFE that 
their corporation had not participated in any drug money 
laundering operation, that no employee had been arrested, and 
that last year an investigation conducted by the Panamanian 
Customs Directorate cast no doubts on the corporation's 
activities. 
  According to government sources, the jewelry corporation in 
Panama is owned by Saul Schwartz, a Jewish businessman who on 1 
June was kidnapped under strange circumstances by unidentified 
individuals who released him uninjured after an unspecified 
ransom was paid through a rabbi.

  [Text] General Ramon Rosa Rodriguez, retired, the new 
executive secretary of the National Antinarcotics Secretariat 
(Senad), has said the resources available to the agency for 
repressing drug trafficking are "infinitely less" than the 
resources available to traffickers. Rodriguez said if he finds 
any military officer or influential person involved in the 
illegal trade he will arrest him or resign from his post. 
  "We have a limited amount of money available, while drug 
traffickers have large amounts. For this reason we have 
infinitely less resources than those available to traffickers. 
It is very difficult to be even in this respect," Rodriguez 
said. 
  Gen. Rodriguez was appointed to the post in a surprise move. 
His name was not mentioned as a candidate for the post and his 
designation was therefore a surprise. 
  Gen. Rodriguez told us that he was first in his class at the 
Military School promotion of 1955. He then entered the Military 
College. He went to Panama where he took infantry training 
courses at a U.S. instruction center. He then travelled to the 
United States to take general staff training courses. 
  He retired in December 1992 when he was 3d Corps general 
staff chief. He confirmed that he worked for the candidacy of 
the present head of state in the Colorado Party primaries and 
the presidential race. 
  As an example of the need to have the means to fight drug 
trafficking, Rodriguez said: "If I am the cook and someone wants 
to eat a steak, I have to get meat. If that person wants a 
steak and I only have rice and noodles, he will not get a steak 
from me." 
  What Rodriguez means is that in his short time as Senad 
secretary he was able to see the need for improvements knowing 
that the resources are limited. He talked about the lack of 
radar and interceptor planes to fight trafficking by air in the 
Chaco. 
  He indicated that trafficking by land in the Chaco is 
controlled by the military units in that zone, but even so more 
personnel are required. 
  Asked about the possibility that a high-ranking military man 
or an influential individual in the government try to get his 
complicity, Gen. Rodriguez said he will have two options. 
First, resort to the president to implement sanctions, and 
second resign. 
  "I am the boss" said Rodriguez, who pointed out that he will 
not allow another individual to run the institution at his will. 
He reiterated the support he received from the president. 
  Previous Senad administrators said they were seriously 
investigating money laundering in our country. Rodriguez said 
the work started by the previous team continues. He was not 
able, however, to give details of the investigation because he 
did not have the information. 
  He emphasized that for the time being he will not replace 
the 
men working with him. He indicated there may be changes in the 
future. 
  Regarding drug addiction in our country, Rodriguez said this 
problem is not yet that serious but it could get worse if 
corrective measures are not taken on time.

  [Text] Demetrio Chavez Pena Herrera, 40, alias El Vaticano 
or Loco Limoniel, the country's most wanted drug trafficker was 
briefly presented today to the media at the Dincote [National 
Counterterrorism Directorate] headquarters in Lima. Chavez, who 
during the presentation was wearing a striped prison suit 
bearing the number 1891 on the back, has been charged with 
narco-terrorism and treason. 
  [Begin unidentified Dincote spokesman recording] According 
to 
preliminary investigations carried out by DINAN [National Police 
Intelligence Narcotics Department] in accordance with police 
report no. 45 of 23 January, evidence was found linking Demetrio 
Chavez Pena Herrera to narco-terrorism activities. [end 
recording] 
  As has already been established, initial DINAN 
investigations 
have uncovered links between El Vaticano and subversive groups 
operating in the Alto Huallaga region. This connection has been 
verified by several former terrorists who decided to surrender 
to the authorities. 
  The charges were acknowledged by El Vaticano to a military 
prosecutor as well as his defense attorney Juan Lazarte Luna. 
  [Begin unidentified Dincote spokesman recording, in 
progress] 
...alias El Vaticano or Loco Limoniel, used them as links to 
ensure their support and cooperation which has been corroborated 
in affidavits by several former terrorists who decided to 
surrender. In turn, the charges have been acknowledged by the 
accused in the presence of his defense attorney as well as the 
corresponding prosecutor. [end recording] 
  The drug trafficker would resort to the services of a few 
terrorists known as Artemio, Clae, Manzini, James, and Liborio 
to transfer protection money [cupos] to the PCP [Peruvian 
Communist Party], Shining Path, as well as MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Party] military and political leaders. 
  Intelligence service investigations have established that El 
Vaticano repaired back roads in the Provinces of San Martin and 
Mariscal Caceres and used them as clandestine helicopter landing 
sites to transport drugs. 
  [Begin unidentified Dincote official recording, in progress] 
...could rely on the protection and support of terrorist 
criminals whom he would pay $5,000 for each flight. In addition 
to that, he would also pay $2 for each kilo of basic cocaine 
paste, and $6 for each kilo of clean basic cocaine paste. [end 
recording] 
  Once Dincote investigations have concluded, El Vaticano will 
be turned over to the Special Army War Council [Consejo de 
Guerra Especial del Ejercito]. On the other hand, the Dirandro 
[General Narcotics Directorate] will continue with its 
independent investigations into drug trafficking and money 
laundering.

<F P=106> [From the "Newspaper of the Airwaves, Second Edition" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The National Counterterrorism Directorate [Dincote] 
has discovered links between drug-trafficker Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera and subversive organizations in Alto Huallaga. 
  Chavez, alias El Vaticano, was presented to the local and 
foreign media a few minutes ago wearing the characteristic 
striped attire in which terrorists are presented. Chavez' shirt 
had the number 1891 and he appeared very briefly--10 
seconds--before the media. 
  Dincote Commander Hugo Sayers Calderon illustrated the links 
between the drug trafficker and the subversive organizations. 
He reported that Chavez had provided weapons to the terrorists 
and had built a rural road at Campanilla. 
  Juan Lazarte Luna, who was Chavez's lawyer until noon today, 
formally announced that he would not defend the drug trafficker 
because, he said, he has too much work. He declared, however, 
that he will continue to defend Demetrio Chavez' sister, Berta 
Chavez, who is scheduled to be released tomorrow. Lazarte also 
reported that Fausto Parra will continue the drug terrorist's 
defense for all pending charges against him. 
  Television host Susan Leon, who is being held at the police 
station women's section for her alleged involvement in the El 
Vaticano case, will be released in the coming hours. Her 
lawyer, Mario Rodriguez Hurtado, presented a habeas corpus 
appeal, which the 5th Arraignment Court has to respond to within 
24 hours. Upon receiving the habeas corpus, 5th Arraignment 
Court Judge Carmen Rojari visited Susan Leon in jail where she 
has been held for the last four days. 
  Also, hair stylist Segundo Gonzales, alias Chocco, who has 
been held at the Dirandro [General Narcotics Directorate] 
headquarters for the last five days, will be released today or 
tomorrow. His lawyer, Rosa del Corral, reported that El 
Vaticano himself had testified that his friendship with the hair 
stylist was only based on the latter's profession. 
  Former Miss World Lucila Boggiano de Zoeger's situation, 
however, is still unknown. She is currently at the Estela Maris 
Clinic where she had to be admitted last Monday. Comedian 
Andres Hurtado, alias Chibolin, and his wife, Marilu Montiel, 
are also under arrest on charges of alleged links to the El 
Vaticano case.

  [Text] Following a drop in drug prices in the Huallaga 
region, coca may soon cease to be the queen of the jungle and 
Huallaga may no longer be a coca paradise. 
  What was until recently the symbol of prosperity and good 
fortune, coca is today associated with poverty and desperation. 
Abandoned towns, empty shops, unfinished buildings, houses for 
sale, and impoverished farmers are now the new image in the 
Huallaga region. In the old coca towns, which have become 
virtual ghost towns, trade is scarce and the economy is shaky. 
The entire region is facing a serious crisis because of a 
shortage of the dollars that came from narcotrafficking and the 
resultant drop in trafficking in the Huallaga area. 
  A Juanjui peasant told EXPRESO: "We used to make money from 
coca, now we lose. Months go by without selling any coca and 
when we do we sell it at below its market value." 
  Last year, cocaine paste sold for $1,500 per kilogram, today 
it is worth $200. 
  The drastic drop in prices follows the strict military 
control of the Huallaga region, which has forced traffickers to 
transfer their main operation centers to the northern and 
southern regions of the country. It seems to herald the end of 
the coca boom in the region. 
  Alto Bravo Mayor Tenazoa Ushinahui said: "Selling coca is 
not 
a lucrative trade anymore. The strict control has caused prices 
to plummet." 
  The decrease in narcotrafficking activities in this, the 
largest coca-producing region in the world, has brought changes 
to Huallaga. 
  Settlers and officials of the region are not the only ones 
to 
express concern over the critical situation affecting the 
region. Even a local beauty queen expressed her opinion during a 
recent beauty pageant in a San Martin district. In an outburst 
of sincerity when the jury asked her about trafficking "Miss 
Chazuta" bitterly complained about "low drug prices." She 
subsequently did not win the contest. 
  Despite its limitations, the military control established in 
the region since the middle of 1993 is the main reason why 
prices have dropped and trafficking activity has decreased. 
  Huallaga settlers believe the Peruvian Air Force [FAP] is 
mainly responsible for the change in trafficking activities. 
This has been achieved even though the FAP's antinarcotics 
struggle faces serious difficulties: It has almost inoperative 
radar and less sophisticated planes than those used by the 
traffickers. The proficiency of the FAP's Tucano [T-27] planes 
to intercept traffickers' planes in the region is acknowledged 
but not always welcomed. One Tarapoto settler complained: 
"Because of the Tucano planes, there are no more `trafficking 
flights' like before." The reputation of the T-27's in the 
region is such that a local orchestra named themselves "The 
Night Toucans." 
  Police operations and the downing of several planes have 
forced traffickers to transfer their operation centers to other 
regions where there is no control, and to change their flight 
routes and schedules to avoid repressive actions. These actions 
have forced Colombian pilots to increase their fees; they now 
charge $100,000 per flight, before they charged only $20,000. 
  Military and police activities have been unable, however, to 
stop an increase in trafficking activities in other regions. 
  The number of trafficking interdiction operations by the 
police rose in 1993 by over 20 percent compared to 1992. The 
figure rose from 3,180 to 3,938 in just one year. 
  Although slightly above that of 1992, the volume of drugs 
seized in 1993, over 8.5 tonnes, is notably less than the years 
when there was no military control. 
  The coca farming areas and the production of cocaine base 
have increased throughout the Upper and Lower Huallaga region, 
and the Udcayali, Ene, Apurimac, and Pichis Palcazu areas. 
  The Center of Development and Research of the Upper Jungle 
[Centro de Desarrollo e Investigacion de la Selva Alta] 
(Cedisa), has stated that coca is farmed in the 200 sub-basins 
of the rivers of San Martin. Biavo, Ponaza, Mishiquiyacu, 
Huayabamba, Saposoa, Sisa, Mayo, Sauce, Aibsea and Cumbaza are 
among the most important. 
  In the Upper Cumbaza region, just 600 km from Tarapoto, 
Cedisa experts have detected at least 600 hectares of coca 
plantations. Thus, trafficking has not been eradicated from the 
entire Huallaga region. Even when there is a shortage of 
flights and dollars, traffickers continue to operate in coca 
producing area villages. 
  The price of white coca paste surged from $220 to $330 per 
kilogram last September just because two flights were made to 
the region. This caused such excitement among Huallaga 
residents that, in their eagerness to sell the devalued white 
powder, residents of Shamboyacu--an eight-block hamlet in the 
Ponzaza valley of the San Martin forest--grabbed the drug they 
had stored and went to sell it in the middle of the street. The 
"coke balls"--of processed cocaine--were sold to the highest 
bidder. 
  Each flight seems to reawaken the villages of the region 
from 
the inactivity imposed by the shortage of dollars. Tarapoto, 
the capital of San Martin region, is by no means an exception. 
Following a flight, customers crowd discotheques, like 
"Papillon" and "Tropicana," where "middlemen" (drug stockists), 
policemen, and many pretentious local ladies mingle. 
  Despite the sharp decline in trafficking in the Huallaga 
region, it is too early to shout victory. The appearance of 
poppy fields in the region and peasants' avowed willingness to 
replace coca with poppies makes one to agree with Juanji Deputy 
Prefect Eduardo Maldonado, who contends that "drugs will remain 
the most profitable business of the region for a long time."

<F P=106> [Interview with Eduardo Ishii Ito, executive secretary of </F>
the Ministry of the Presidency's International Technical 
Cooperation, CTI, agency, by unidentified EL PERUANO reporter; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [EL PERUANO] What is CTI's 
situation in Peru now that conversations with the U.S. 
Government have resumed? 
  [Ishii] Our International Technical Cooperation is going 
through a process of growth and clear evolution at a time when 
we are resuming full diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial 
level. 
  [EL PERUANO] Regarding the national drug prevention and 
control plan, what agreements have been reached with U.S. 
Ambassador Alvin Adams? What is the implementation schedule? 
  [Ishii] The U.S. ambassador met the president of the 
commission responsible for drawing up the drug control and 
prevention master plan. He offered his cooperation, in the 
methodological aspect, for writing the draft of the document 
that will be presented at the end of February in accordance with 
deadlines established by law. [passage omitted] 
  [EL PERUANO] What agreements are being implemented and what 
ones are in a process of approval by the CTI in Peru? 
  [Ishii] During 1993 we created joint commissions to 
negotiate 
and program important projects for the country's development. We 
arranged intergovernmental meetings with Germany, Spain, the 
Netherlands, and the EEC. We also arranged other preparatory 
meetings for negotiating diverse projects. This year we will 
have joint commissions with Switzerland, Great Britain, Spain, 
the Netherlands, and other countries. [passage omitted] 
  [EL PERUANO] Is there a certain method or system developed 
by 
the CTI in Peru that is being copied by other countries? How 
does that system operate? 
  [Ishii] Technical cooperation in Peru has developed and 
implemented diverse ways of implementing projects, particularly 
in emergency zones. The implementation of small social interest 
projects (Pepicos) and the creation of cooperation funds, which 
gather and convert donations of food, equipment, and machinery 
into cash, are important. We have used those funds to implement 
sustainable development projects in areas where the government 
has very little influence. We also must stress that project 
implementation is direct, that is, it is carried out by those 
will benefit from the program. 
  [EL PERUANO] How large is U.S. participation in the fight 
against drugs? 
  [Ishii] There are U.S. personnel in the country. They are 
deployed in the Upper Huallaga region. This support is in answer 
to bilateral agreements between the United States and Peru. 
  [EL PERUANO] Are there any suggestions for Peru and other 
countries to form a common strategy at the world or hemispheric 
level within the new guidelines established by the United States 
to fight drug trafficking? 
  [Ishii] The Peruvian Government has a defined position 
regarding the fight against drugs because it is a problem 
affecting all countries, consumers and producers alike, one way 
or another. This means that we must form a common strategy to 
fight drug trafficking. 
  [EL PERUANO] How much did the CTI receive during 1993? How 
much does it expect to receive during 1994? 
  [Ishii] During 1993 the CTI received nearly $400 million. 
This year we expect to receive approximately $500 million.

  [Text] Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santa Gadea has told 
EXPRESO that the Council of Ministers has in fact approved a 
bill imposing stricter penalties on those who cultivate poppies. 
For example, first-time offenders will be sentenced to 8 year 
imprisonment terms, and will be stripped of their land. 
  He explained that this was done "for a very simple reason, 
namely the kind of product involved. Addiction to poppy heroin 
is 50 times stronger than addiction to cocaine paste. In 
addition, trafficking in opium and poppies is the most vicious 
trafficking in the world. It rules southeastern Asia, and now 
intends to colonize us. It is estimated that there are 50 
hectares of poppies in Nueva Cajamarca, in San Martin. They 
must be destroyed. If we do not do it now we will be unable to 
control it later. We still have time. And those who planted 
poppies should be jailed and their land should be transferred to 
the state." 
  President Alberto Fujimori yesterday announced that a bill 
will be submitted to Congress imposing penalties of up to 20 
years for poppy growers, who have begun to cultivate the plant 
in Cajamarca, San Martin, and Madre de Dios. Unlike coca 
growers, whose activity is not considered criminal, poppy 
growing will be strictly repressed, he said.

  [Text] The Air Force invested 3 million soles in 1993 to 
control the 17 airstrips and airports in Upper Huallaga, and in 
infrastructure and equipment for the various groups deployed in 
the area. 
  This figure does not include the allocations for flight 
hours 
and fuel used by the Air Force for interdiction operations. 
  Among the Upper Huallaga airports that the Air Force began 
to 
control in July 1992 are those in Santa Lucia, Tocache, Uchiza, 
Saposoa, Bellavista, Juanjui, Tarapoto, Yurimaguas, Sion, 
Palmapampa (Ayacucho), Izcosazin, and Caballococha (Amazonian 
Trapeze), Puerto Bermudez, and Pucallpa. 
  Concerning the Palmapampa airport, which is located in La 
Mar 
Province (Ayacucho), the Air Force has controlled it since 1 
November 1993. 
  This airport was very important for drug trafficking in the 
area, because that area had become a drug trafficking storage 
center. 
  The drugs were taken from Upper Huallaga to this area, to be 
loaded in small Colombian planes that took off in Colombia, 
crossed Brazilian airspace (Cruzeirodo Brasil zone), and arrived 
in Palmapampa.

  [Text] According to the PNP [Peruvian National Police] 
Intelligence Directorate (Dirin), a tribe of Aguarunas is 
cultivating extensive poppy farms in the area known as 
Naranjillo in Rioja Province, San Martin Department. The PNP 
reported that the natives are not allowing the police to enter 
the area. 
  It has been learned that another group of Aguarunas is 
farming poppies in the Campanilla region in Juanjui, which is 
the center of operations of the criminal gang headed by "El 
Vaticano." 
  Moreover, it has been learned that in Palmapampa, in the 
Apurimac River valley in Ayacucho, a group of settlers openly 
support drug trafficking activities. 
  Regarding poppy farming, from which opium is extracted to 
manufacture heroin, a PNP spokesman said that the Aguarunas are 
armed and do not allow the police to get near their poppy 
plantations. 
  He added: "We have to avoid a clash with the natives, 
because they are unaware that they are engaged in criminal 
activity." 
  In this regard he added that a drug trafficker operating in 
this area had won the confidence of the Aguarunas, who in 
exchange for the poppies obtain food, medicine, and some money. 
  The spokesman said that for the time being the police are 
trying to contact the Aguaruna chiefs to inform them that they 
are participating in a crime subject to drastic punishment. 
  It has been learned that residents of Palmapampa, in the 
Apurimac River valley in Ayacucho, openly support the activities 
of Peruvian drug traffickers who has previously been expelled 
from the Upper and Lower Huallaga regions. 
  A PNP officer said that a few days ago Palmapampa residents 
impeded a PNP helicopter from landing. The helicopter was 
carrying personnel to undertake an investigation into coca 
farming in the region. 
  The source added: "Local residents fired shots at the 
helicopter with weapons supplied by the drug traffickers." 
  He also said that although the helicopter did land, the 
police were not allowed to enter the village. 
  The PNP colonel commanding the police detachment was told, 
in 
explanation of this action, that the residents live from coca 
farming. 
  The PNP is also facing problems in the antidrug fight in 
Oxapampa and Caballococha. 
  In these areas drug traffickers have better means of radio 
communication than do the PNP or the Armed Forces.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich denied 
statements by Colombian authorities regarding an increase in 
coca and marijuana crops on Venezuelan territory. He considered 
them to be "a campaign to discredit Venezuela's image." 
  "I am concerned with such statements because possibly a few 
laboratories and coca crops exist in the Venezuelan border 
area--the country's most inhospitable zone (...) but to say that 
Venezuela is a country where cocaine and marijuana are 
extensively grown is to lie," the minister stated. Ochoa 
pointed out that "there has been a very conspicuous campaign of 
comments against Venezuela in the past days. As foreign 
minister, I categorically reject such comments." 
  He added that "Colombia and Venezuela, as neighboring 
countries, have to review and reevaluate our bilateral policies. 
There are sectors in both countries that sincerely want 
integration. However, there are also sectors that maintain a 
radical position against Venezuela; I will always reject them." 
  Omar Baralt, the head of the Venezuelan delegation at the 
Border Affairs Commission, also questioned Colombia's attitude 
regarding border issues and especially regarding the illegal 
trafficking of stolen vehicles. He said, "Colombia does not 
dare implement drastic measures" to stop this activity because 
"it fears the border will be paralyzed." Baralt explained that 
80 percent of the vehicles in the border area are Venezuelan. 
His statements were made after the Border Affairs Commission 
presented a final report to Venezuelan President Ramon J. 
Velasquez after four years of work. 
  Enrique Vargas, head of the Colombian delegation at the 
commission, emphasized that Colombia and Venezuela have worked 
jointly to identify more than 70 common problems. He said that 
"incidents that prompt friction are not good but they are 
inevitable."

<F P=106> [By staff reporter He Jun: "China and U.S. Join To Fight </F>
Drug Trafficking"] 
  [Text] China and the United States have agreed to 
strengthen their co-operation in the fight against drug 
trafficking and illegal immigration, said officials of the 
Ministry of Public Security. 
  The two sides reached the consensus on Tuesday [25 January] 
during talks between Bai Jingfu, Vice-Director of the National 
Narcotics Control Committee and Robert Gelbard, the U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State for international narcotics matters. 
  Bai and Gelbard exchanged views on fighting international 
narcotics crimes, especially those originating in Asia's 
notorious "Golden Triangle," the sources said. 
  The two sides agreed on the necessity of strengthening their 
efforts in fighting the drug trade. 
  The Chinese side said it hoped the U.S. would adopt measures 
to remove any barriers impeding the two nations from working 
together to stop the drug trade. 
  Gelbard was quoted by the sources as saying he would "try 
his 
best" to do so. 
  Gelbard also held talks on illegal immigration with Zhang 
Hongxi, Director of the Consular Affairs Department of the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  During their meeting Zhang outlined factors contributing to 
smuggling and illegal immigration, reiterated China's opposition 
to such activities and discussed what steps have been taken to 
combat them. 
  Zhang asked the U.S. to clamp down on the so-called 
"snakeheads"--those involved in smuggling Chinese people to the 
U.S. 
  He said that China opposes the U.S. Government offering 
political asylum to these smugglers. 
  Such people, he said, falsely claim they are fleeing 
political persecution in China. 
  And he added that China's view on granting asylum 
indiscreetly is that it encourages smuggling. 
  The Chinese officials said that normal exchanges between the 
two countries should continue and that they hoped the U.S. 
Government would help Chinese who apply for visas from the 
country. 
  Gelbard said the U.S. is formulating new laws to crack down 
on international crime organizations. 
  He also said the US is willing to strengthen co-operation 
with China to combat crime. 
  And relevant U.S. departments are ready to work with their 
Chinese counterparts, the U.S. official said. 
  At the meeting, the two sides agreed to establish an ad hoc 
consultation system, further strengthen bilateral exchanges and 
co-operation between law-enforcing departments, exchange 
information and take effective measures to punish those who 
smuggle people. 
  Describing his talks with the Chinese officials as "frank, 
friendly and productive," Gelbard told reporters that both sides 
"expect greater cooperation at all levels." 
  Gelbard left Beijing yesterday for Fujian, Guangdong and 
Yunnan provinces en route to Thailand and Hong Kong.

  [Text] Beijing, January 26 (CNS)--The public security and 
border defence forces in Yunnan and Guangxi were recently 
praised for their efforts in fighting gun and drug trafficking 
there. 
  According to the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, 324 
cases of gun trafficking had been smashed with 374 military 
firearms seized. Some 961 cases of drug trafficking had been 
dealt with the seizure of 812.3 kilograms of opium and 762.5 
kilograms of heroin. One hundred and thirty-six criminal gangs 
were broken in Yunnan and Guangxi last year. 
  The public security and border defence departments in the 
province and region had detailed a big number of its forces for 
border duty to strengthen inspection of arrivals and departures, 
having a 24-hour inspection service for both individuals and 
vehicles crossing at key points. 
  The border checks will be strengthened further this year. On 
New Year's Day this year, a gun trafficker was caught in Bose 
Prefecture in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous region close to the 
Sino-Vietnamese border and five guns and 21 bullets seized.

<H3>  Eighth Sichuan Provincial People's Congress Standing 
Committee Announcement (No. 7) </H3>
  The "Sichuan Counternarcotics Regulations" has been ratified 
by the Fifth Session of the Eighth Sichuan Provincial People's 
Congress Standing Committee on 28 Oct 1993, and its 
implementation is hereby announced. 
  Sichuan Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee 
  28 October 1993 
<H5>  Section I General Rules </H5>
  Article 1: These Regulations have been formulated based on 
the "National People's Congress Standing Committee's Decision on 
Counternarcotics" and other relevant laws, rules, and 
regulations and taking into account Sichuan's actual conditions 
to crack down on the smuggling, trafficking, transportation, and 
manufacturing of narcotics and the illegal growing of 
drug-producing plants and other criminal activities and to ban 
the taking and injection of drugs in order to protect the 
physical and mental health of the citizens and to preserve 
social order. 
  Article 2: Drugs in these Regulations refer to opium, 
heroin, 
morphine, marijuana, cocaine, amphetamine and state-controlled 
substances such as dihydrochloric AITUOFEI [1002 2094 0803] and 
DULENGDING [2629 0397 0002] and other addictive narcotic drugs 
and psychoactive drugs. 
  Article 3: To crack down on the smuggling, trafficking, 
transportation, and manufacturing of drugs and on the illegal 
growing of drug-producing plants and on other criminal 
activities and to ban the taking and injection of drugs, we must 
rely on the general principle of comprehensive treatment and the 
principle of integrating specialized agencies and the mass line

<F P=106> [By Yindee Lertcharoenchok in Rangoon] </F>
  [Text] The Burmese border minister has accused Thailand of 
being unwilling to co-operate to crush drug warlord Khun Sa and 
his Mong Tai Army, who can "dodge into Thailand whenever they 
want." 
  Lt Gen Maung Thint said Khun Sa and his followers survive 
only because they get food, arms and ammunition from sources in 
Thailand. 
  He said Burmese government forces need Thai assistance if 
they are to crush them, but he has not yet raised the issue with 
Thai officials. 
  There was no immediate urgency. Rangoon was preoccupied 
negotiating truces with other armed ethnic groups and holding 
the national convention to draft a new constitution. 
  In the meantime, the ruling State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (Slorc) would accept Khun Sa's surrender if he also 
disarmed his Mong Tai Army. However Col Kyaw Win, deputy 
director of the Directorate of Defence Services Intelligence 
(DDSI), said that even if he surrenders Khun Sa will still have 
to answer for his crimes and his narcotics activities. 
  Khun Sa, or Chang Si-fu, controls a narrow strip of 
territory 
east of the Salween River in southern Shan State, alongside the 
Thai border province of Mae Hong Son. 
  "The Thai government is not willing to co-operate with us," 
Maung Thint told The Nation. "They [Khun Sa's forces] get food, 
supplies, arms and ammunition from Thailand. That is why he 
still survives. His survival depends on Thailand." 
  "They [Thailand] never consider wiping out Khun Sa. 
Moreover, he is able to dodge into Thailand whenever he wants." 
  Maung Thint, minister for development of border areas and 
national races, said the MTA was unlike other ethnic forces, 
which are holding talks with Rangoon. Slorc considered Khun Sa 
both an insurgent and a drug baron. However the minister 
minimized the MTA's military strength, saying it has no fighting 
capability and relies on arms purchased with drug money. 
  "We are determined to fight him and wipe them [the MTA] out 
by force," he said. 
  However, "if he surrenders and disarms, the govemment will 
accept him and will let him participate in [border] development 
projects." He said it would take time to "wipe Khun Sa out 
totally." "In the meantime, we are holding the national 
convention and are inviting other insurgent groups to return to 
the legal fold. In the present circumstances it is not the time 
to get rid of him." Khun Kyaw Win was outspokenly critical of 
Thai authorities for allowing Khun Sa to "jump the fence" into 
Thailand. He said the Burmese military had no immediate plan to 
move against the MTA and was currently pursuing a "containment 
policy," trying to restrict its movement and territory. 
  The colonel said up to 50,000 troops and porters would be 
needed to bring down Khun Sa and that high government casualties 
would be unavoidable. The MTA could field an estimated 
8,000-15,000 fighters. 
  The rugged terrain posed no difficulties, he claimed, 
although air strikes were not likely due to the danger of 
accidental encroachment into Tnailand and a shortage of 
helicopters. 
  He also pointed to the likelihood a new drug kingpin 
emerging 
once Khun Sa was eliminated.

  [Text] The Agency for National Security Planning (NSP), 
the nation's top intelligence agency, has established an 
"information center for international crimes" to tackle 
increasing terror, smuggling and narcotics-related crimes, the 
NSP announced yesterday. 
  The NSP will also open offices to receive reports on such 
crimes in five major cities--Seoul and port cities of Pusan, 
Inchon, Cheju and Masan. 
  An NSP spokesman said that the agency's move is to counter 
effectively the growing number of international organized crimes 
which occurred in the country recently. It is seen as part of 
the agency's effort to suit itself to the changing political and 
economic atmosphere. 
  The NSP will fight against such crimes in the context of 
national security, said the spokesman. 
  The spokesman said the newly established information center 
absorbs the "counter-narcotics information center" initiated 
last June. Last year, the counter-narcotics center collected 
over 300 pieces of drug-related information and distributed them 
to the prosecution, police and foreign intelligence agencies, 
according to the spokesman.

Amphetamine Factory Raided, International Drug Cache Captured; 
Suspect Big Brother' Shao Yuanlai, Founding Member of Narcotics 
Mob, Distribution Network in Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, Den 
Caught in Midst of Operations"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Justice Investigations Bureau's 
Maritime Investigations Office, under the supervision of Keelung 
District Chief Inspector Kuo Wentung, uncovered and raided an 
amphetamine factory in Tucheng in Taipei County at one o'clock 
yesterday morning. At the scene trafficking in amphetamines they 
caught red handed the international drug kingpin and general 
sleaze Shao Yuanlai, along with Tang Mingkuei and Chen Chialong, 
a foreign-born laborer who was helping manufacture the 
amphetamines. They seized 150 kilograms of amphetamines and 
partially finished products and expanded the continuing 
investigation into the international amphetamine distribution 
network. 
  For the amphetamines seized by the Maritime Investigations 
Office in this raid, the raw materials had been smuggled in from 
Mainland China; the smuggling pipeline consisted of shipment by 
fishing boat to the coast of 400 kgs of raw material which could 
produce 200 kgs of amphetamines. In yesterday's raid only 150 
kgs of amphetamines and partially manufactured drugs were 
seized, so some 30 kgs [sic] had already slipped the net. Some 
of the amphetamines are sold in Taiwan, but the majority are 
sold in Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia, and the suspect Shao 
Yuanlai is one of the "founding members" of the amphetamine 
manufacturing and selling ring in this country and could have 
been engaged in such activities for a long period of time. 
  In June of this year Keelung District Investigations Office 
Deputy Prosecutor Wang Chintsung, while investigating an 
amphetamine ingestion case discovered that the amphetamine raw 
material was smuggled in by fishing boat and that the final 
amphetamine products were also smuggled abroad by fishing 
vessels, and so handed the case over to the Maritime 
Investigations Office for handling. In September the 
Investigations Office discovered that Shao Yuanlai (age 54) was 
involved in the smuggling of ephedrine hydrochloride from which 
amphetamines are produced for sale throughout the country and in 
Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia and that he had close 
connections with international underworld organizations. 
Considering the situation critical, they mobilized a stakeout 
and search for evidence against the criminals. Two nights ago 
they received information that Shao Yuanlai and T'ang Mingkuei 
(age 42) who acts as a large scale drug dealer, were to carry 
out a transaction. In a lightning swift move very early 
yesterday morning, they seized an amphetamine factory set up in 
the basement at Yungfeng Road Lane 242 Number 20 in Tucheng 
City. When the investigators on the scene entered the 
amphetamine factory, Shao Yuanlai was in the process of handing 
a case of amphetamine products to Tang Mingkuei, and although 
they tried to hide, all were captured. It was later learned that 
because Shao Yuanlai owed Tang Mingkuei a large amount of money 
for the amphetamine raw material, the amphetamine products being 
exchanged yesterday were to pay part of his debt, and they had 
no inkling it would all be seized. 
  The three men arrested by the Maritime Investigations Office 
yesterday included Shao Yuanlai, aka "Big Brother," a Korean 
born Chinese, formerly with the Hanyang Medical Academy in 
Korea, has a record of 12 violations of the narcotic drug 
control regulations and was arrested in 1991 by the Keelung 
District Courts for violating these ordinances; Tang Mingkuei, 
of Taipei, has also been in custody for violating the narcotic 
drug control regulations; Chen Chialong, (23), is from Malaysia, 
is a foreign born laborer. The Maritime Investigations Office 
has already turned the three men over to the Keelung District 
Prosecutors Office for investigation and trial for violating the 
drug control regulations.

  [Text] Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak said Thailand does 
not support drug trafficking and will cooperate with the 
international police in suppressing the trade in illegal 
narcotics. 
  The minister said if Khun Sa could stop producing heroin as 
he announced, the country's image would be indirectly improved, 
for Thailand has often been accused of being a drug trafficking 
route for the heroin produced by the drug warlord. 
  Thailand was in fact the first country in Southeast Asia to 
persuade hilltribes people to stop producing heroin, thanks to 
the initiative of His Majesty the King, noted Gen Wichit. 
  Meanwhile, Narcotics Suppression Bureau [NSB] Commissioner 
Somchai Milintharangkun announced an increase in the police 
personnel, technology, and rewards to combat drug dealers. 
  Pol Lt-Gen [Police Lieutenant General] Somchai also promised 
to take severe action against careless police who allow drug 
dealers to escape from captivity. Bad police must be ousted. 
NSB police might also be transferred because some are easily 
corrupted by drug dealers when offered money and property. 
  He also had a plan to move drug suppression offices to a 
more 
well-protected area to prevent information on confidential cases 
from being leaked.
