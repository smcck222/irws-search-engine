  [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 
0900 GMT on 20 January reports that "the Lebanese border unit of 
the Galilee District Police last night seized 10 kg of heroin 
believed to be worth over $1 million. Our correspondent in the 
north Yo'av Aviv reports that the drugs were seized from an 
Israeli drug dealer who had smuggled it from Lebanon in the 
Metulla region." 
  Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 23 January carries a report by 
Shmu'el Tagar on page 4 which states "last Friday night 10 kg of 
marijuana were seized from an apartment in one of Elat's new 
neighborhoods." The report notes that the Elat police have 
detained three persons suspected of smuggling the drugs from the 
Sinai for distribution in Elat and the rest of Israel, adding 
that "this morning the three will be brought before an Elat 
judge for extending their remand." 
  Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English on 27 January in a 
report by Raine Marcus and ITIM on page 14 reports that "a man 
and woman suspected of dealing in marijuana in Tel Aviv's 
Sheinkin area were remanded for a week by Tel Aviv Magistrates 
Court yesterday." The report notes that "detectives found two 
kilograms of marijuana in a pillowcase and an additional four 
grams elsewhere in the apartment, but both suspects deny any 
connection to the drugs." THE JERUSALEM POST adds that "after a 
period of drought Tel Aviv is now flooded with marijuana, 
according to a senior narcotics squad officer. In the last two 
months alone detectives in the greater Tel Aviv area have seized 
30 kilograms of marijuana, apparently grown in Sinai, said the 
officer." Later on in the report, the paper writes: "In Petah 
Tiqva yesterday, police acting on a tip off found 12 kilograms 
of marijuana in an abandoned building. Nobody has come forward 
to claim the drugs and police are looking for the owner." 
  "In Haifa yesterday, Egged member Aharon Zalmanovitz, 35, of 
Nahariyya, was remanded until February 6 by the Haifa 
Magistrates Court on suspicion of smuggling and dealing heroin. 
Police found 1.3 kilograms of heroin in Zalmanovitz's 
apartment."

  [Text] The Drug Enforcement Bureau of the Namibian Police 
[Nampol] last year confiscated a total of 3,262kg of Cannabis 
valued at N$[Namibian dollars]10,426,362 and arrested 366 people 
in connection with drug smuggling. The police revealed this on 
Friday following a media enquiry. 
  Apart from the massive Cannabis haul, 75,439 Mandrax tablets 
valued at N$2,263,170 were seized. 
  Nampol said most of the drugs had been confiscated through 
the "excellent assistance of the public," while others had been 
seized in joint operations with neighbouring countries. 
  In 1993 Cocaine valued at more than N$1.3 million had also 
been confiscated. 
  Overall there had been 242 cases involving drugs during 1993 
and 366 people had been arrested of whom 37 had been foreigners. 
The police again warned the public about the danger of drugs 
and urged people to report any cases of drug smuggling to the 
nearest police station.

  [Text] Lagos, 24 Jan (AFP) -- Nineteen suspected drug 
traffickers were arrested between January 1 and 17 at Lagos 
International Airport with a total of 12.88 kilograms (28 
pounds) of narcotics, an official statement said here Monday. 
All the suspects, except one, were arrested on arrival here, 
said the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in the 
statement. 
  Eleven out of the arrested suspects came on board Brazilian 
Varig Air, seven on Ethiopian Airlines and one on Egypt Air, 
said the text. All the suspects who came in on the Brazilian 
airline and Egypt Air brought in cocaine while those arrested on 
Ethiopian Airlines were found with heroin, said the statement. 
  According to the NDLEA, the arrests "have confirmed an 
earlier observation that (...) the Brazilian carrier, Varig Air 
is the worst culprit in terms of bringing drug traffickers and 
their wares into this country." 
  The Ethiopian company was another airline "with a bad 
reputation in this country" for the frequency of arrests 
regularly made on the airline, said the text. Out of the entire 
seizure, cocaine accounted for 6.6 kg and heroin 6.28 kg. 
  Last month, Africa's biggest drug haul was recorded in 
Nigeria when a suspected `drug baron' imported into the country 
248.3 kg (546 pounds) of high grade heroin. The suspect, Joe 
Brown Akubueze, who bought the drugs in Thailand, is currently 
standing trial on charges of drug trafficking before a special 
tribunal in Lagos. 
  The NDLEA was established in 1990 to fight drug trafficking 
in all its ramifications.

  [Text] Durban Jan 26 SAPA -- A 45-year-old electrician was 
arrested in Amanzimtoti near Durban on Tuesday with about 150 kg 
of dagga [marijuana] apparently destined for The Netherlands. 
Police spokesman Maj Bala Naidoo said on Wednesday the dagga 
was compressed in 127 packages hidden in two pool tables. Its 
South African street value was about R[rand]150,000, but it 
would have fetched R4 million in The Netherlands. 
  Durban Narcotics Chief Maj Piet Meyer said Tuesday's arrest 
was part of an investigation into a drug syndicate. The same 
people had been implicated in about five similar cases in the 
past three years. "We are still busy with further investigations 
to see if we can close down the syndicate once and for all," Maj 
Meyer said, adding that the organisers preyed on unsuspecting 
people, manipulating them into doing the "dirty work" for a 
portion of the profit. 
  He said South Africa's superior quality dagga was much 
sought 
after overseas. Amsterdam's got most of its dagga from South 
Africa and Morocco, but "South African dagga is more potent and 
it's in demand because the quality is better," Maj Meyer said. 
  The man is expected to appear in court this week.

  [Text] Zambia has called on the donor community for help in 
its fight against drug trafficking. The Zambian Foreign Affairs 
Minister Remmy Mushota said Zambia was committed to ridding 
itself of the scourge of drug trafficking but did not have 
adequate resources to carry out the task alone. Dr. Mushota 
told diplomats in Lusaka that while Zambia appreciated the 
concern of the donor community about drug trafficking, 
corruption, and transparency, it was also imperative that heads 
of diplomatic missions did not become over-zealous. He said 
diplomats should observe diplomatic propriety and etiquette.

<F P=106> [Article by Cees Zoon: "Mafia Exploits East European Drugs </F>
Market"] 
  [Text] Prague -- The money changers who once made the 
famous St. Wencelas Square in Prague unsafe have long found a 
new trade. The words "Wechseln?" or "Change?" no longer pass 
their lips, even though a tradition continues in their working 
methods. Passers-by who let themselves be led along to a dark 
passage or porch are not offered local money, but pure heroin or 
amphetamines. 
  The Czech capital has built up a serious drugs scene. Prague 
is home to most of the addicts in the Czech Republic, who 
according to reliable estimates have grown to number around 
30,000 people. The great majority of them use stuff made in 
local laboratories, like "brown," which contains codeine, or 
"ceko," which is sometimes called "the crack of the East." 
  But the biggest growth is to be found in the number of 
regular users of heroin and cocaine, substances which could not 
be found in communist times, but now are widely available. 
Prague is not exceptional in this respect. The same applies to 
Warsaw, where the drugs mafia is also working the market with 
verve. In Poland the number of hard drug addicts has increased 
to 40,000. 
  The fall of communism and the opening of the East European 
borders has not only created a market for Western industry, but 
also for the international mafia. Eastern Europe has become the 
most important transit region for drugs into Western Europe and 
at the same time a market with phenomenal perspectives. 
  The underworld has put down showy roots in Prague and 
Warsaw. 
The Prague police think that more than 3,000 mafiosi from 
Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, the former Yugoslavia and now Colombia 
have started to compete with local organized crime. 
  However, the Chinese (whom the police call the most 
dangerous 
group) and the camorra are increasingly reported. The Home 
Affairs Ministry said that last autumn the Italian and Russian 
mafia set up a joint venture in Prague, with the Italians 
providing the brains (specialists in laundering drugs money) and 
the Russians providing the muscles (Afghanistan veterans as 
killers). 
  The drugs route from east to west has shifted from the 
Balkans to central Europe. Yugoslavia was traditionally the 
transit route, but when war broke out the transporters found an 
alternative route. They were helped in their choice by the 
defective legislation and police equipment in countries like 
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. 
  The greater part of the drugs following this route come from 
the golden triangle in south-east Asia and the Asiatic republics 
which until recently were part of the Soviet Union. But the 
Colombian cartels also see the usefulness of a detour, as 
witnessed by the recent catches in Polish harbors. 
  The number of drugs shipments intercepted is increasing 
rapidly in every East European country. The Hungarian police 
seized 692 kg of cocaine and heroin last year, nearly 10 times 
more than the previous year. The same picture can be seen 
throughout all of eastern Europe. 
  Of course this is only a minimal part of the quantities 
which 
are passing through all the borders and reaching Western Europe. 
According to the International Drug Control Bureau in Vienna, 
just how much the supply to Western Europe is increasing can be 
seen more clearly from the market situation there: The quality 
of heroin is increasing and the price dropping significantly. 
  However, the mafia no longer sees the region as a 
straightforward transit station, but is working hard at creating 
a new market. The result is that in Prague, heroin is offered 
at a "promotion price" of around 2,500 crowns (160 guilders) per 
gram. 
  This sort of strategy will certainly encourage drug tourism. 
In nearby Bavaria, for example, five times more is paid for a 
gram of heroin. In the Bulgarian capital Sofia, users can buy a 
gram of heroin for between 800 and 2,000 leva (between 50 and 
125 guilders). In Slovakia, the police have seen dealers giving 
away their goods free of charge to secondary school pupils. 
  The Czech Republic and Poland are simultaneously producers 
and exporters of synthetic drugs. While local drug addicts 
prefer the switch to heroin and cocaine, 75 percent of the 
amphetamines consumed on the Berlin drugs scene come from 
laboratories in the Czech Republic and Poland in particular, for 
example. 
  Legislation is a problem everywhere. In most countries drug 
dealing is illegal, but the "possession of small quantities for 
personal use" is not. 
  The law is to be changed in Poland and the Czech Republic, 
but it remains questionable whether that will alter much. The 
customs authorities and police are fairly powerless against the 
gangs who deal with supply and distribution. Recently a series 
of treaties were signed by East European countries among 
themselves and with international organizations like Interpol. 
  The police in the whole region are currently no match for 
the 
mafia, which is better organized and equipped. It has the most 
modern communication equipment and a pool of fast cars. The 
police has to make do with telephone lines which hardly work and 
ramshackle cars. 
  Up to now the Polish Smuggle computer program, specially 
developed for the Central Customs Council, had no separate drugs 
category: Drugs smuggling came under the category of "others." 
It was only this month that a new program started to be used 
which includes the new headings "drugs" and "arms." 
  The police in Bulgaria, next to the border with Turkey, are 
at the forefront in the fight against drugs. But here too there 
are problems. To cut expenditure, only 240 liters of petrol is 
available every month for each police car. Once it has been 
used, the car stays in the garage.

  Tirana, January 25 (ATA) -- The Albanian prime minister, 
Meksi, met with the delegation of the Bulgarian Interior 
Ministry, led by [Interior] Minister [Viktor] Mikhaylov. 
  Mr. Meksi expressed the desire to further promote relations 
with the Bulgarian state and added that "Albania is very 
interested that the best possible relations exist among the 
Balkan states, the more so with Bulgaria with which Albania has 
joint interests both in trade and in the movement of people. 
Contacts will keep increasing," Mr. Meksi said. "But knowing 
that along [with] natural and honest circulation between the two 
countries, there is also a drug and arms trafficking, the 
bilateral agreement signed assumes a special importance." 
  Mr. Mikhaylov conveyed to Mr. Meksi the greetings of the 
Bulgarian prime minister and voiced full readiness of his 
country to cooperate in the fight against organized crime. 
  On the same day, Mr. Mikhaylov was also received by the 
public order minister, Agron Musaraj. During their talks, the 
ministers treated problems worrying their countries and 
exchanged experience. 
  "Our objective is to train a new generation of police 
officers, who are devoted and will strictly observe the laws," 
Mr. Musaraj said.

<F P=106> [Dan Damian report: "Virgil Magureanu Holds Talks With the </F>
Chinese Intelligence Service on the Asian Drug Dealer Networks"] 
  [Text] Virgil Magureanu, the director of SRI [Romanian 
Intelligence Service], has been to Beijing in China over the 
past week. Being there at the invitation of China's public 
security minister [Tao Siju], Magureanu held a series of talks 
with representatives of the Chinese intelligence service, 
intended to share information gathered by the two intelligence 
services in an effort to combat drug trafficking. 
  Another goal of the visit is related to the fact that since 
1989 Romania, like other Eastern European countries, has been 
facing a crime wave in which Asians are also involved and some 
of these violations could also threaten Romania's national 
security. 
  The SRI director, carrying a (black) Romanian diplomatic 
passport, left for Beijing on a TAROM [Romanian national 
airline] charter flight.

  [Text] Some 625 kg of powder hashish has been impounded in 
an operation carried out in Hakkari by the Directorate of Police 
in Bitlis. The Governor's Office in Bitlis has disclosed that 
the teams from the Narcotics Department contacted two persons,

  [Text] Groznyy, 31 Jan (CHECHENPRESS-TASS) -- "Anyone who 
is peddling drugs in the republic, either for profit or at the 
instructions of the secret services, must be physically 
eliminated," Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev said in Groznyy 
at a regular sitting of the republic's Security Council. 
Dudayev's statement was released today by the CHECHENPRESS 
agency. The Chechen president's opinion is that "with the 
connivance of local authorities and law enforcement bodies, drug 
addiction has reached such proportions that it threatens the 
nation's gene pool." 
  The CHECHENPRESS agency reports that the procurator general 
"has been instructed to draft a law on applying the death 
penalty to drug dealers." 
  According to Dudayev, "As a beginning, it is necessary to 
hold a few public executions," CHECHENPRESS reports.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 27/1/1994 -- In 1993 in Moldova 
265 cases of drug addiction were registered, which is 120.8 
percent more than in 1992, BASA learned from Vitalie Bruma, head 
of drug combating section of the Interior Ministry. Most 
frequent cases were registered in Balti, Soroca and Chisinau. 
Drug business is especially practiced by Gypsies from the 
republic's north, who have a special conspiratorial layout. 
According to the quoted source, drug addictions increased 
between Gypsies. Last year, 12 hectares of poppy and 120 
hectares of other plants have been discovered and liquidated. 
Moldova is especially interesting for the "Balkan way," by 
which the drug traffic is made from Asia to West Europe. 
Attempts were made as Moldovan addicts do not have the needed 
finances. Moreover, drugs produced in Moldova are of same 
quality as the Asian. According to experts, one U.S. dollar 
invested in drug business brings an annual income of $10,000. 
Presently, one glass of poppy raw material costs 5 lei, and a 
glass of acetylene used for preparing drugs costs 4 lei. The 
Ministry of Health does not have the needed finances and a 
special hospital to cure addicts. Vitalie Bruma added.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Gavrilovich Belyavskiy, doctor of </F>
medical sciences and chairman of Drug Control Committee of 
Ukrainian Ministry of Health, by Yuriy Vilenskiy; date and place 
not given: "There Will Be Drugs in Ukraine, But They Will Be 
Under Control"] 
  [Text] The drug onslaught, which is aimed primarily 
at the younger generation, has become a reality, and Ukraine's 
barriers on the fatal path have not been reliable enough to 
date. Now a subdivision of exceptional importance to public 
health is taking action. PRAVDA UKRAINY interviewed Chairman 
V.G. Belyavskiy of the Drug Control Committee of the Ukrainian 
Ministry of Health, doctor of medical sciences. We will begin 
with a few words about him. He is a well-known toxicologist and 
he heads a laboratory in the Scientific Research Institute of 
Pharmacology and Toxicology, where he has been working for 25 
years. 
  [Vilenskiy] Vladimir Gavrilovich, what is the moral and 
legal 
platform of the committee you head? 
  [Belyavskiy] The committee was established in accordance 
with 
the decision of the Ukrainian National Security Council "On the 
Status of the Struggle Against the Drug Traffic in Ukraine." No 
one is likely to disagree with the statement that an effective 
struggle against the drug menace necessitates the united efforts 
of all state and public organizations. The creation of the 
National Coordinating Council To Combat Drug Abuse could be 
viewed as the first step, and the next logical step was the 
creation of a special agency of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health 
to establish control over the production and distribution of 
medicines containing narcotic substances. That is how our 
committee came into being. 
  [Vilenskiy] How will it operate? 
  [Belyavskiy] First of all, we will be guided by the articles 
of the UN Convention on Narcotic Substances (1961) and the UN 
Convention on Psychotropic Drugs (1971) and by Ukrainian laws. 
  Now that our state is effectively on its own in the fight 
against the expanding drug traffic, we need a new and more 
responsible approach to the import and export of drugs and 
semimanufactured products containing narcotic and psychotropic 
substances. Their inclusion in legal records, the issuance of 
permits to establishments and institutions for the use of these 
substances for scientific and medical purposes, the drafting of 
drug use standards in medicine and science, and the replacement 
of those that might lead to pathological addiction are the 
responsibility of the new committee. 
  This is far from a complete list of what we plan to do. 
After 
all, there are no secondary issues in today's world of medicines 
and drugs. Incidentally, certificates of authorization to import 
and export narcotic drugs have already been approved. Now these 
regulating documents of the Drug Control Committee will be 
obligatory. 
  The statute on the committee was approved by the Ukrainian 
Ministry of Health and Ministry of Internal Affairs. The 
committee members are medical experts and pharmacologists, as 
well as representatives of the Ukrainian Supreme Court, Security 
Service, Customs Service, Ministry of Justice, and ministries of 
foreign and internal affairs. Therefore, it is an 
interdepartmental subdivision on the state level. 
  [Vilenskiy] Vladimir Gavrilovich, you have a draft of the 
law 
of Ukraine on the procedure for handling narcotic drugs, 
psychotropic substances, and precursors on your desk. Our 
readers probably have not heard anything about it.... 
  [Belyavskiy] I will begin by clarifying the terminology. 
Narcotic drugs are the plants and compounds described as such in 
international conventions and categorized as such by our 
committee. Then there are the psychotropic drugs that can be 
dangerous to human health because of their psychological 
effects. Finally, precursors are the substances and salts used 
as chemical raw material in the production of narcotic drugs and 
psychotropic substances. 
  The draft law consists of 33 sections covering this whole 
complex sphere. The passage of the law will be of inestimable 
importance to the future of Ukraine. 
  [Vilenskiy] As far as I know, the law also restricts the 
cultivation of opium poppies and several strains of hemp used as 
narcotic raw materials. 
  [Belyavskiy] Yes, and this is of vital importance. Besides 
this, it also proposes a new type of prescription for narcotic 
and psychotropic drugs. Medicine needs these drugs, but strict 
records will be kept of all prescription forms to guard against 
forgery. Each prescription will be recorded in a register, and 
receipts will confirm the legal acquisition of the drugs. In 
other words, the law will stipulate specific procedures for the 
physician and the pharmacist. It should guard us against drug 
abuse and protect the health care system from encroachments by 
the "black market."

  [Text] Lima -- The governments of Paraguay and Peru agreed 
to combat the improper use, production, and illegal trafficking 
of drugs and psychotropic substances. This agreement was signed 
on 31 January by Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez 
Boettner and his Peruvian counterpart, Efrain Goldenberg 
Schreiber. 
  The agreement's purpose is to promote cooperation between 
the 
governments of Paraguay and Peru in order to prevent and combat 
with greater efficiency the illegal trafficking and abuse of 
drugs and psychotropic substances by harmonizing their policies 
and developing coordinated actions and programs. 
  In order to fulfill the agreement's objectives, the two 
countries' pertinent services will exchange information about 
preventive measures against drug abuse in their respective 
territories. 
  They also will prepare joint strategies to prevent drug 
abuse, the illegal production of drugs, and to repress drug 
trafficking. They also will exchange information about illegal 
trafficking and the use of precursors and basic chemicals, 
illegal trafficking routes, and the modus operandi of drug 
traffickers. 
  The two countries' foreign ministers have likewise signed 
another agreement for the reciprocal protection and promotion of 
investments, wishing to intensify economic cooperation to the 
two countries' benefit. The document states that each country 
will guarantee the investments and free transfer of payments 
connected with these investments, especially profits, loan 
mortgages, and others made by the other country. 
  Ramirez Boettner and Goldenberg Schreiber also signed a 
cooperation agreement between the Diplomatic and Consular 
Academies of Asuncion and Lima. In turn, Presidents Wasmosy and 
Fujimori signed a joint declaration in which they reasserted the 
friendship between the governments and peoples of Paraguay and 
Peru.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar yesterday 
evaluated relations between Bolivia and the United States. He 
said they are "narcotized," adding that Bolivian and U.S. 
antidrug efforts have not yielded the expected results. 
  The minister examined the interdiction, prevention, and 
alternative development programs. He admitted that "they have 
had no visible effects," either in the United States or in 
Bolivia. 
  Replying to questions from reporters, he said the subject is 
"controversial" and has caused confrontations in the search for 
consensus. 
  He said the reduction of illegal coca plantations in Bolivia 
has not been reflected in the volume of drugs entering the U.S. 
market. In addition, Bolivian peasant producers "have had no 
guarantees on the sale of their products to that country." 
  The minister said the peasants have found no market for 
their 
products and, because of the economic nature of this problem, 
they do not support the bilateral antidrug effort. 
  Among the achievements he mentioned were those attained 
between 1987 and 1992, when the area of illegal coca plantations 
was reduced by 47 percent, that is, by almost half of the limit 
established. 
  He said: "This shows the Bolivian Government has made a very 
great effort to reduce the offer of cocaine by reducing the 
cultivated areas." He added: "This caused a debate on the 
benefits of the policy and on its success or failure." 
  In Bolivia there is a clear difference between the 
traditional use of coca, its cultural value and its historical 
significance, and its use for the production of narcotics, which 
is regulated by Bolivian-U.S. agreements. 
  This situation has, to a considerable extent, narcotized 
Bolivian-U.S. relations, for which reason agreements and 
exchange notes were signed each year, combining the repression 
of traffickers with alternative development.

  [Text] The police have arrested 47 more people in Beni and 
Santa Cruz Departments, 10 of them Colombians. They are members 
of the Mariposa network, linked to the Colombian drug cartels. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Amalia Pando] These youngsters 
of 
22 and 23 years of age, Eduardo Lima Lobo Dorado and Oscar Lima 
Lobo Dorado, are members of the family making up the Mariposa 
network, which exported about 1,500 kilograms of cocaine per 
month. They were arrested five days ago in San Joaquin, Beni 
Department. Two other brothers were also arrested: Joselo 
Ignacio Lima Lobo and Carmen Lima Lobo. A fifth brother, Jesus 
Einar Lima Lobo Dorado, escaped, and a sixth brother, Edwin 
Douglas Lima Lobo, has been held under arrest for one year. The 
father of these brothers, Ademar, was identified by Government 
Minister German Quiroga as the head of the Mariposa network: 
  [Quiroga] The Lima Lobo brothers are being processed for 
drug 
trafficking. The antinarcotic officials are after Jesus Einar 
Lima Lobo Dorado, who escaped during the operation in San 
Joaquin. Another brother, Edwin Douglas Lima Lobo, was arrested 
about one year ago, and is being held on charges of drug 
trafficking. The operation of the Mariposa network began in 
March 1993. The actions of antidrug agents allowed the capture 
of 47 individuals linked to this important drug trafficking 
network. In addition to the arrests, members of the Special 
Antinarcotics Force seized six light airplanes, eight ranches, 
two labs for processing drugs, and about 2,400 kg of cocaine 
base. 
  [Pando] There are 10 Colombians among the 47 arrested. The 
special force believes this network was linked to the Cali 
cartel through Celimo Andrade, who was arrested more than one 
year ago and is being held in the Chonchocoro jail. This 
network also had links with the Medellin cartel through (Omar 
Casis Candia). This is the second network of drug traffickers 
which has been dismantled within the last seven days. [end

  [Text] A Civil Police detective and an informer were caught 
red-handed by Military Police [PM] agents early this morning in 
Rio de Janeiro. They were transporting 22 kg of cocaine base 
and ammunition for smuggled weapons. Police believe it had been 
brought to the city through the Galeao International Airport. 
  Detective Luiz Eduardo Sato and police informer Luiz Etienne 
were caught red-handed by members of the PM secret service. 
They were coming down Andarai Hill, in the northern part of Rio 
de Janeiro, in a police patrol car. In the trunk, police found 
22 kg of cocaine base--the raw material to produce cocaine--and 
a large amount of ammunition. There were bullets for AR-15 
rifles--the favorite gun of traffickers and armored car 
robbers--and even shotgun shells which explode upon impact. 
These shells were unknown to the police. 
  The detective said the drugs and ammunition had been seized 
during a police operation and would have been taken to a police 
station. The PM agents also found 10 million real cruzeiros in 
the detective's car. The police said the money was probably 
part of the payment by traffickers for transporting the drugs 
and ammunition. 
  The police reported that the drugs and ammunition were to 
have been delivered to the main shantytowns to the north of Rio 
de Janeiro. It was to have been taken to the Andarai Hill slum; 
the Borel Hill slum, where the Red Command is headquartered; the 
Macacos Hill slum in Vila Isabel District; the Turano Hill slum 
in Rio Comprido District; and the Mineira Hill slum in Estacio 
de Sa District. 
  Police believe the detective is trafficker Niltinho do 
Dende's trusty. Niltinho do Dende is one of Rio de Janeiro's 
main traffickers who has distribution posts at Governor Island 
where the detective works and where the Galeao International 
Airport is located. Police believe Galeao airport is the gate 
for trafficking into Brazil and the main connection for an 
international drug and weapons distributing route. 
  [Begin Police Department Director Jorge Mario Gomes 
recording] Generally the route begins in Colombia and Bolivia 
and leads to Brazil, which is frequently used as a bridge to 
African countries and from there to Europe. This is the usual 
route. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article: "Cali Surrender Stalled"] </F>
  [Text] On Tuesday afternoon, after several high-level 
meetings, President Cesar Gaviria telephoned the DAS 
[Administrative Department of Security] director, Fernando 
Brito, to request his presence at the meeting with the attorneys 
of two presumed traffickers from Valle. It was due to be held 
the following day at the office of the prosecutor general of the 
nation, Gustavo de Greiff. 
  What the president wanted was to establish his position on 
the policy of surrender, after rumors citing previous talks in 
which the presumed drug traffickers requested house arrest 
during certain phases of the surrender process. 
  However, what most concerned Gaviria was the fact that the 
matter of confession apparently had not yet been clearly 
explained during the previous talks with the attorneys of 
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Julio Fabio Urdinola. 
  For those reasons, the president decided to send Justice 
Minister Andres Gonzalez and the DAS director to the meeting at 
the prosecutor general's office. 
  The fact is that, until that Wednesday, 12 January, the 
talks 
had been conducted through the prosecutor general and the 
attorney general of the nation, Carlos Gustavo Arrieta, who, in 
turn, were reporting to the government. Nevertheless, in 
December the president decided to take part in the matter and, 
at several meetings between De Greiff and the justice minister, 
agreement had already been reached on the government's presence 
at the meeting planned for early January. By that time, a 
tentative date had been set, but the exact day and time had not 
been decided. 
  On 11 January, Gonzalez, with the prosecutor general and 
attorney general, confirmed the date and time of the meeting: 
Wednesday, 12 January, at 1500. 
  When Brito and Gonzalez arrived, the prosecutor general and 
attorney general were already conferring with the drug 
traffickers' attorneys. Some tension was felt there, due mainly 
to the presence of the DAS director, because only the minister 
was expected. Moreover, the fact of not knowing in advance who 
was going to attend apparently annoyed the prosecutor general, 
according to one source. 
  Then, with the attorneys, the determination was made that 
this was an informal meeting, and it was agreed that, when the 
surrender processes actually began, each government department 
would play its part. In other words, they would be judicial 
proceedings that no one from the government would have any 
reason to attend. 
<H5>  The Meeting Began </H5>
  Finally, at 1510, the meeting began. 
  First, one of the lawyers took the floor, stating that it 
was 
Rodriguez's and Urdinola's desire to surrender based on the 
expedient of house arrest, in the course of a process that 
should culminate in one result, either: dismissal of all charges 
or sentencing to a prison term. 
  The next to speak was Minister Gonzalez. The official 
explained to the attorneys the design of the surrender policy, 
indicating that anyone who surrenders must have a real 
willingness to submit to a process, to collaborate effectively 
with the authorities, and to confess his criminal activities. 
  Nevertheless, the traffickers' lawyers used the argument 
that 
it was very important to their clients not to make a mandatory 
confession. They noted that it was the intention of the two 
presumed traffickers to submit to a trial without meeting that 
requirement. The justice minister, for his part, claimed that a 
surrender and repentance did not suffice. 
  The other attorney intervened, also declaring that what the 
two presumed drug traffickers wanted was to have the information 
supplied by them to break up the Medellin Cartel taken into 
account in their case. 
  However, according to sources queried by EL TIEMPO, that 
decision is incumbent solely on Prosecutor General De Greiff, 
who must assess the veracity of those reports, which could 
become a part of the government's policy on collaboration. 
  After the remarks, the DAS director spoke, claiming that the 
government did not consider house arrest part of the surrender 
policy. He added that anything other than the terms of that 
program was not associated with the state's position. 
  The two lawyers, somewhat shocked, commented that such 
blunt, 
clear talk was quite positive, making it possible to obtain 
information on the government's thinking. Furthermore, they said 
that, from this standpoint, the process could not continue until 
they first consulted with their clients. 
  Prosecutor General De Greiff then remarked that the decision 
on house arrest was a judicial determination, but the DAS 
director reaffirmed the negative position on house arrest. 
  Specifically, the official declared that the government did 
not interpret the policy of surrender in that way, and that the 
issue being treated had to be viewed clearly. 
  Gonzalez, for his part, claimed that they were not dealing 
with any criminal organization or common crimes, and that, for 
the persons under discussion and the crimes with which they were 
charged, it was impossible to seek house arrest. 
  Finally, Brito asserted that the government would not, under 
any circumstances, permit house arrest, among other reasons, 
because its implementation would have no acceptance on the 
international level. 
  After 1700, when the two government officials concluded 
their 
remarks, De Greiff declared the informal meeting adjourned, and 
remained in a hearing with the attorneys. 
  According to the government, the essence of the matter is 
that various conditions must be met for the process to continue: 
imposition and effective serving of adequate sentences in 
regular jails, and real, effective collaboration with the 
administration of justice. In other words, the state must be 
allowed to solve crimes and to sentence those judicially 
culpable. 
  Hence, in the government's opinion, the surrender of the 
Cali 
Cartel members is muddled, for the present; because it is 
assumed that they will not fully accept the surrender policy. 
However, a second meeting has already been arranged; and, as one 
government official aptly observed: "All is not lost."

<F P=106> [Report by Diego Hernan Canal from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] According to the 4th Army Division commander 
[General Carlos Julio Gil], the Cali Cartel is moving its 
cocaine processing and exporting headquarters to Vichada 
Department. The Army Division commander personally flew to the 
zone to organize the struggle against this scourge. 
  The eastern plains have become the new sanctuary for 
cocaine. 
The drug cartels, especially the Cali Cartel, have chosen this 
region as a safe haven for their laboratories. An estimated 70 
percent of the alkaloid is being produced in this zone, 
particularly in Vichada Department. 
  [Begin General Carlos Julio Gil recording] It appears that 
the country's cartels have agreed to work in the plains. [end 
recording] 
  It was learned that the Medellin and Cali drug lords decided 
to stop processing the alkaloid in their regions in order to 
negotiate with the law. The alleged Valle del Cauca drug 
leaders have reportedly set a deadline of 15 February for the 
removal of laboratories from that department. Regional 
commanders met with the Army commander at Villavicencio to 
review this new situation. 
  [Begin Army Commander Hernan Jose Guzman recording] We must 
implement new methods, new tactics to face this situation. [end 
recording] 
  Those new tactics will be determined this afternoon after 
the 
military meeting ends. In addition, steps will be taken to 
guarantee the electoral process throughout the country, 
especially in this zone, where numerous municipalities feel the 
pressure of guerrilla forces.

<F P=106> [Report by Diego Fajardo from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Italian drug trafficker Roberto Panunzzi is 
currently in a DIJIN [Judicial Police and Investigations 
Directorate] cell in Santa Fe de Bogota. He was captured in 
Medellin and will be extradited to his country in a few hours. 
Panunzzi faces two charges in Colombia: one for drug

  [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Progreso in Spanish at 
1200 GMT on 2 February reports that Cuba "enjoys international 
prestige for its policy against trafficking in and consumption 
of drugs." Cuba's Armed Forces and courts severely sanction 
anyone, Cuban or foreign, who tries to traffic in drugs in Cuba. 
The radio notes: We know that our society is not perfect; a 
number of drug-related incidents has been detected. However, 
guilty parties have had to bear the full brunt of our laws. The 
following case illustrates the effective action of our police 
agents in the systematic fight against drugs. 
  When the Special Crimes Department of the Havana City 
Province Police Operations Unit learned that "a certain amount 
of" cocaine was "going to be sold and bought" at a home in La 
Lisa Municipality, they set up an operation in which the 
Investigations Technical Unit [Unidad Tecnica Investigativa] and 
the provincial DTI [Department of Technical Research] 
participated. Four citizens were arrested and cocaine seized. 
Captain Angel Perez Ramos of the Havana City Province Police 
Operations Unit was in charge of the investigation that revealed 
that Giraldo Arzola Valdez, Aurelio Alfonso Bolanos, and Alberto 
Machado Gutierrez--all with terrible social conduct records and 
criminal records--were illegally buying and selling drugs. It 
was determined that the drugs came from one of the eastern 
provinces, where they had washed up on shore. Capt. Perez noted, 
moreover, that although the citizenry knows that trafficking in 
and using drugs is forbidden in Cuba, "there are unscrupulous 
individuals who devote themselves to buying and selling drugs, 
which is severely punished by our society." Despite this, Perez 
added, the 17 people charged in this case had engaged in the 
illegal activity without regard for the consequences. 
  Capt. Perez said that the accused in this case were tried at 
the end of 1993 and that the public prosecutor has asked for 
stiff prison sentences for them. Radio Progreso concludes: "Soon 
we will announce the sentences given the accused by the judges 
in accordance with the degree of criminal involvement of each."

  [Text] Police in Grenada last weekend made their biggest 
ever cocaine bust. 
  Some 60 kilos of the illegal drug were seized on board the 
vessel, "Let Me Live" on Sunday inside Grenada's territorial 
waters. 
  The illegal drug has a street value of around 33.3 million 
E.C. dollars. 
  "Let Me Live" was on its way from neighbouring Trinidad and 
Tobago to Union Island which is one of the Grenadine Islands 
controlled by St. Vincent when it was intercepted by the Grenada 
Coast Guard. 
  It was brought to the Coast Guard base at True Blue where 
the 
search was carried out by a joint Police and Customs party. 
  After the drug discovery was made, the six occupants of the 
boat, five Vincentian nationals, and one Trinidadian were 
arrested and subsequently charged for drug possession. 
  The Vincentians are Ishmel Hal (51), Constantine Alexander 
(25), Winston Nanton (25), Clement McIntosh (22), and Lawrence 
Alexander (48), while the Trinidadian is Sylvan Liverpool (50). 
  With the exception of Liverpool, the other five are crew 
members of "Let Me Live." 
  Liverpool has been quoted as saying that he was taking a 
ride 
on the boat in order to meet another vessel in St. Vincent on 
which he is employed as a seaman. 
  When the six accused were brought before Magistrate Patricia 
Mark on Tuesday, she remanded them to Richmond Hill prisons 
until December 1. 
  Barrister-of-law Neil Noel has been retained to represent 
four of the accused--Hall, Nanton, McIntosh and Liverpool. 
  The two Alexander's who are close relatives will be 
represented by lawyer Anslem Clouden. 
  Authoritative sources told GRENADA TODAY that the six 
suspects were arrested due to a tip-off received by Customs 
Officials. 
  A source said that when the boat was intercepted by the 
Grenada Coast Guard the search party was directed straight to 
the section where the furniture was located and told to search 
there for the illegal drugs. 
  The cocaine was discovered hidden among a number of parcels 
of black pepper among the furniture. 
  Police suspect that the drugs were placed there in an effort 
to prevent snifferdogs from detecting them in case of a search. 
  There are reports that the cocaine was intended for a 
national of Union Island. 
  Another source told this newspaper that it appears that only 
two of the six suspects are really connected to the drugs. 
  He also said that there is a "definite link" between the 
cocaine discovered and five Trinidadians freed in a Magistrate's 
court on the island recently. 
  The source stressed that all of them belong to the same drug 
trafficking ring which operates out of Port-of-Spain. 
  Prior to Sunday's haul, the biggest ever discovery of 
cocaine 
on the island was in June 1991, when 45 kilos carrying a street 
value of 25 million E.C. dollars were seized by police at a 
hotel in the south of the island. 
  Nationals Diego Peters and Spencer Drakes of LaPotrie, St. 
Andrew's were arrested and charged for possession of the drugs.

  [Text] Roatan, Islas de la Bahia--Cesar Augusto Somoza, 
spokesman for the Public Security Force, reported yesterday that 
a total of 21 kilos of cocaine, several rocks of crack, and a 
small amount of marijuana were seized over the weekend from the 
Manhatan boutique in this city. 
  The operation, carried out by antinarcotics police, resulted 
in the arrest of Jose Aristides Flores Najera, from whom the 
cocaine was seized, and his accomplice Jose Francisco Moreno 
Reyes. In Oak Ridge, in this jurisdiction, Samuel Liver and 
Edilberto Diaz del Cid were arrested after one was found with 
four ounces of marijuana and the other with a piece of crack. 
  Police also seized a boat owned by Najera, and an AK-47 
rifle 
with the necessary ammunition from Gilbert James Brook. 
  As a result of the police raid on the boutique, owned by 
Najera, additional arrests for possession of marijuana and crack 
were made. These included Helen Bush, Valentin Alvarez Amaya, 
and July Martinez Randy. 
  Somoza indicated that the cocaine that was seized is quite 
"respectable," considering that the price ranges from $25,000 to 
$30,000 per kilo. He added, however, that it is difficult to run 
police operations in this department because it requires a great 
deal of air, land, and naval resources to conduct proper patrols. 
  Following a number of complaints by citizens on the island 
and by Deputy Julio Galindo of this department that drug 
trafficking is a normal occurrence on the islands, Somoza 
explained that it takes a long time to investigate, seize drugs, 
and arrest those involved. 
  In this regard, he revealed that continued efforts will be 
made in Islas de la Bahia, vigilance will be stepped up, and the 
police force will be strengthened. 
  The police spokesman noted that many of the drugs coming to 
Islas de la Bahia are on their way to the United States, 
although some of them stay there and are consumed inside the 
country. 
  He also denied that the operation was the result of the 
constant complaints lodged by Deputy Galindo, since "the 
antinarcotics police work 365 days a year and 24 hours a day." 
  In this connection, he explained that for the past three 
months, police have been working hard to find the cocaine that 
was just seized, and there are no indications that police agents 
have received any money from drug traffickers in this area. 
  One of the persons arrested, Zenon Valentin Alvarez Amaya, 
originally from Tela, Atlantida, stated that the drugs had been 
placed in his bag without his knowledge by Denis Lino Avila, 
acting on orders from Dionisio Alvarez, who manufactures 
balconies and works in Agua Azul. 
  Francisco Moreno alleged that he had come in voluntarily 
because the police had arrested his wife, Katya Matute Moreno, 
who is being held in Guanaja. He said that he has no ties to 
drug traffickers. 
  Flores Najera, from whom 17 kilos of cocaine was seized, 
insisted that he had no middleman, and this is the first time he 
has been involved in this business. He reported that he traded 
the drug for shellfish with people in Puerto Cabezas, who would 
go out and sell it there, and said that he intended to 
distribute the drug over the next five or six months. 
  Najera, who works in the fishing industry, stated that 
sometimes "stuff can be found floating around" at sea, and that 
is how people can pick up a few kilos. 
  He denied having any connection to the police in drug 
dealing, which had been alleged by some residents of Islas de la 
Bahia. 
  The owner of the boutique stated that many people from 
Jamaica, Colombia, and Nicaragua commonly traffic in drugs on 
the high seas, and that this is another way of getting drugs. 
  All of the arrestees have been in custody since Friday, and 
will be remanded to the appropriate courts so that their cases 
can be investigated.

  [Text] Kingston (NICA)--The Customs Department and the 
Narcotics Police Division have their hands full these days 
detecting cocaine being smuggled to Jamaica from Panama, Curacao 
and Colombia by paid "mules" (female couriers). 
  The smugglers target especially, the COPA flight from 
Panama, 
ALM from Curacao, and SAM from Colombia. 
  The female cocaine smugglers, who hide the drug in body 
cavities, are reported to be paid US$200 each when they deliver 
the drug intact. On the average, each packet recovered from 
vaginal searches weigh 14 ounces. The search is always done by a 
doctor. 
  A Customs Department spokesman explains: "Once we target 
them 
and take them down to the search room, the doctor does all the 
searching. And we have all the equipment, forceps and boxes and 
boxes of sterilized gloves." The spokesman pointed out that 
although the law states that a female customs officer could 
search a female patient, the internal searches are done by 
female doctors only. 
  On being recruited here as couriers, most of the women, 
first-time travellers, claim they are higglers going to buy 
goods abroad. Their airfares are paid and they are provided with 
accommodation, food and ground transport in the country where 
they go to pick up the cocaine. Usually, they go and return on 
SAM, COPA or ALM. Usually, the recruiter travels to Jamaica on 
the return flight with them, having supplied them with the drug 
in the source country. Once they arrive here safely with the 
drug--that is they clear Customs and the Narcotics Police 
without the cocaine being discovered--they are paid. 
  Men are recruited as couriers too, their method of choice 
being swallowing balls of cocaine in condoms. Men and women 
couriers smuggle the cocaine in autoparts, and other 
merchandise, in bath soaps, in hollowed-out custom-built clothes 
hangers, in wig and sneakers or submerging it in cooking oil. 
  Of nine women targeted by Customs in September as "mules," 
six were held. But three escaped. In September, four men 
suspected of having swallowed cocaine balls in condoms escaped 
from the Cornwall Regional Hospital, Montego Bay, by jumping 
through a window. A man who arrived at Sangster International 
Airport, Montego Bay, on the SAM flight from Colombia, the same 
month, was found to have swallowed 63 pieces of crack cocaine. 
  Estimated street value of cocaine in Jamaica now is $200,000 
to $230,000 a kilo. In 1992 when cocaine was more plentiful, the 
price was $180,000 a kilo. 
  Wily cocaine smugglers change their techniques frequently, 
but the Customs Department and the Narcotics Police catch on 
just as fast. 
  Women smugglers started another trend recently--smuggling 
cocaine in lotion bottles having liquefied it. The result is 
that Customs is now giving these lotion bottles a more-than 
cursory check. 
  Then there is the "internal conspiracy" at the island's two 
international airports, the Norman Manley in Kingston, and the 
Sangster, Montego Bay, whereby the courier, by prior 
arrangement, deposits the cocaine in the female toilet or in 
flower pots, and employees there pick it up. 
  And ganja trafficking continues to be a problem, showing up 
more frequently these days in mailbags bound for the U.S.A., 
especially from the Norman Manley International Airport. Random 
probes with sharp instruments of "normally wrapped parcels" in 
mailbags have been turning up ganja. 
  Drug smuggling continues on other fronts too, targeting in 
particular legitimate exports such as ground provisions. 
  "The ganja is smuggled in every section of an empty 
container 
that you can think of--the ceiling, the floor, the walls," the 
Customs spokesman said. 
  "Then they are put in drums, labelled something else and 
shipped. But the smuggler's choice these days for getting out 
the ganja, is in scrap metal, because it is so difficult to 
handle."

<F P=106> [Article by Lloyd Williams: "Three Jamaicans Die From </F>
Cocaine Ingestion"] 
  [Text] Kingston (NICA)--Three Jamaicans have died here and 
overseas in the last few days from ingesting cocaine which they 
were smuggling in packets in their stomachs. 
  Police sources have identified them as Sonia 
Whitley-Anderson, 38, of Kendal, Hanover; Ovel Washington 
Porter, 28, a seaman of Flankers, St. James and an unidentified 
male higgler. 
  Mrs. Whitley-Anderson died in Montego Bay on Thursday on 
arriving on the SAM flight from San Andres, Colombia; Mr. Porter 
died in Bermuda on Sunday and the unidentified higgler died 
Thursday morning while he was preparing to take the COPA flight 
back to Kingston from Panama City. 
  According to Narcotics Police Division sources, Mrs. 
Whitley-Anderson went to San Andres off the Colombian coast on 
SAM flight 506 which left from Montego Bay on Sunday and 
returned on Thursday. 
  She fell ill while the plane was returning to Montego Bay 
and 
when it landed at 3 p.m., a physician who was on board, 
pronounced her dead. 
  Five small packets of cocaine were found in her brassiere 
and 
she is believed to have swallowed several more to smuggle them 
in. 
  An autopsy is to be done on her body tomorrow. 
  The unidentified male higgler was found dead in the Aruba 
hotel in Panama City on Thursday morning. 
<H5>  Sources </H5>
  Sources say he was getting ready to leave for Kingston on 
the 
COPA flight yesterday when he died from an overdose of cocaine 
which he swallowed to smuggle here. 
  Mr. Porter worked as a seaman aboard the cruise ship Song of 
America but lost his job recently. He left Jamaica on November 
23 and after travelling to Miami, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia, 
arrived in Hamilton, the capital of Bermuda, on December 4. He 
fell ill and died the following day and an autopsy done on him 
on December 6 revealed that he had in his stomach 24 packets 
with substance confirmed to be cocaine, weighing 191.99 grams. 
  Half a gram of cocaine in Bermuda sells for US$125. 
  Mr. Porter's body is to be flown to Jamaica today 
(Saturday). 
  On Thursday agents from the Narcotics Police Division 
accosted four women who had arrived at the Norman Manley 
International Airport in Kingston aboard COPA flight 4l8 from 
Panama City. They were intercepted outside the airport after 
they had cleared immigration and customs. 
  One, identified by the police as Joan Watson, 38, higgler, 
of 
11 Olympic Way, Kingston, stripped herself naked and refused to 
be searched, but the police subdued her and when she was 
searched, a packet with 1 lb. of cocaine was found in her vagina. 
  The others, Joan Watson's sister, Densetta Watson, 33, 
Maureen Patterson, 30, of 263 Amos Path, Bay Farm Villas, 
Kingston and Lavern Wilson, 38, of Chapelton Road, May Pen, 
Clarendon, were similarly searched and each was found with a 
packet with 3/4 lb of cocaine in the vagina. The cocaine was 
wrapped in masking tape. 
  All four were charged with possession of cocaine, dealing in 
cocaine and importing cocaine. They are to appear before the 
Sutton Street RM court next week.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Manuel Diaz C.] </F>
  [Text] Members of drug cartels are using the Pacific coast 
area between the Azuero Peninsula and Punta Burica, in Chiriqui 
Province, to drop packages containing drugs which are later 
transported ashore, a source at the National Air Service (SAN) 
has reported. 
  According to the source, authorities constantly receive 
reports of fishermen and residents on drug shipments that are 
brought ashore. The source added that this kind of activity has 
also been reported in several provinces, such as Chiriqui, 
Colon, and Veraguas. He said that in the Atlantic sector, boats 
are using the island of Escudo de Veraguas for illegal 
activities due to the lack of surveillance. 
  The source stated that the SAN is constantly conducting 
operations in the most vulnerable points for this kind of 
activity, but the lack of aircraft and resources prevents them 
from maintaining constant surveillance. 
  However, the source said he did not know whether the town of 
Viento Frio in Colon Province is being used for the trafficking 
of drugs. He indicated that so far SAN authorities on the 
Atlantic coast do not have reports on the use of this location 
as a point for transshipping narcotics. Recently, residents of 
this town reported the presence of boats that drop drug 
packages, which are later picked up by persons who sell 
narcotics. 
  During 1993, the authorities conducted several 
counternarcotics operations in the Provinces of Chiriqui and 
Bocas del Toro, which led to the arrest of several people 
allegedly involved in drug contraband.

  [Excerpts] Celedin -- President Alberto Fujimori denied 
meeting Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman Reinoso in his cell 
at the Callao naval base, as was reported in the media a few 
days ago. 
  The press report states that during the meeting it was 
agreed 
that from now on the government will use the criminal 
organization's financial resources for purposes other than 
subversive activities. [sentence as published] 
  Fujimori, after asserting that he has not and will not hold 
a 
meeting with Guzman, said the report was "biased and ill 
intended" but did not refer to the media. 
  Fujimori also confirmed that drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," has been placed at the disposal of 
Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate] after it was 
established he had clear connections with terrorist groups, 
especially the Shining Path. 
  He went on to immediately explain that that does not mean 
Dinandro [the Police Antidrug Division] will stop its 
investigations into drug trafficking. He said: "Investigations 
will continue simultaneously." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Undercurrent" section: "Disagreements Within the </F>
Navy"] 
  [Text] Despite efforts to keep secret a meeting that 
President Alberto Fujimori and Vladimiro Montesinos held with 
Abimael Guzman and his friends at the Callao naval base, some 
details were leaked to the Navy, where there was a strong 
quarrel between some admirals who are against these negotiations 
and the politicization to which the institution is being 
subjected. As a result of this, some changes were introduced. 
Vice Admiral Ricardo Villaran Tapia, the chief of staff, was 
transferred to a "meaningless" post in the National Defense 
Secretariat. In 1992, Villaran was in charge of the General 
Command of Naval Zones (Congezonas), a key post with command of 
troops. Villaran is the second most senior on-duty vice admiral. 
  Another Vice Admiral who protested, Luis Giampetri Rojas, 
was 
also punished. He was designated chief of staff, a bureaucratic 
post with little power. Giampietri headed Congezonas in 1993.

Ku King M. in Buenos Aires, date not given: "Drug Trafficking 
Increasing Dangerously in Peru"] 
  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires--Brigadier General Alberto 
Arciniega Huby of the Peruvian Army, considered one of the best 
military strategists in Peru's fight against terrorism and drug 
trafficking, has charged that drug trafficking is increasing 
dangerously in his country. 
  Arciniega blames President Alberto Fujimori's government 
advisers for not following through on a single strategy to 
defeat the drug trafficking that has raged in the northeastern 
jungle of Peru for several years. 
  "Those (advisers) have done us the greatest harm and are the 
best collaborators the traffickers could have had because they 
have not allowed the application of any strategy since taking 
power," he stressed. 
  Arciniega says that despite the fact that "everything was in 
place to do so," the advisers had obstructed all efforts and 
even "kept us from implementing antidrug strategies at a time 
when the American Government was willing to engage in joint 
operations." 
  The 52-year-old general has been in political exile in 
Argentina since last January, having left his country on the 
heels of a military crisis involving him, one that eventually 
turned him into an enemy of the current head of the Army, 
General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza Rios. [passage omitted] 
  General Arciniega, who faces trial in his country for the 
alleged crime of insulting a superior officer and offenses 
against the nation, is one of the two Peruvian generals now in 
exile in Argentina because of the political crisis in Peru. 
  The other is General Rodolfo Robles Espinoza, who left Peru 
in May in fear for his life after denouncing members of the Army 
as being behind the disappearance of a university professor and 
nine students. 
  Having served as an Army officer for 34 years, 9 months, and 
21 days, Arciniega has not lost hope of returning to his country 
one day "in order to cooperate wherever necessary," mainly in 
his area of expertise: the war on drug trafficking. 
  He says he bears no grudge against President Fujimori even 
though the latter publicly leveled accusations against him. 
However, he did criticize the chief of state harshly for the way 
he has governed and "for the mistakes he is making" in Peru. 
  Arciniega now spends his time with his wife studying English 
thanks to a scholarship provided by friends. He is also getting 
ready to apply to Harvard, where his well-known antidrug 
strategy and experience have been deemed worthy of study and 
made into a course: C16-91-1044.0, in the John F. Kennedy School 
of Government's catalogue. 
  Arciniega states that in 1989, while he was commanding 
officer of the Huallaga Front (the area considered the biggest 
drug trafficking factory and the strategic bastion of the 
terrorist group known as the Shining Path [SL]), a strategy was 
implemented that "enabled us to win the support of coca growers 
numbering in the thousands and thus deprive the terrorists of 
their social base." 
  "My antidrug trafficking operations enabled us to 
destabilize 
the Shining Path and led to the recovery of the Marginal 
Highway, while at the same time winning the support of the 
peasant population," Arciniega recalls. 
  He admits leading his troops into many battles against the 
terrorist groups, but "my fundamental strategy was basically to 
consider the coca growers--some 60,000 families--as peasants 
rather than drug-trafficking criminals." 
  The general also claims that when he encouraged supporting 
the peasants as they gradually replaced coca crops with other 
products, the Shining Path began to suffer a resounding 
political and social defeat. 
  "It was the peasants themselves who threw all the SL's out 
while my troops and I engaged in simultaneous actions to break 
up the Shining Path's first People's Guerrilla Army (EGP) 
between April and December of 1989," he recalls. 
  He emphasizes that it was the Army and people together who 
waged the fight against the Shining Path "until Abimael Guzman 
finally lost his will to have another army and immediately 
changed tactics." 
  He also recalls that in 1989, when a number of intelligence 
reports stated that the leader of the Shining Path was 
celebrating his birthday in a place in the jungle known as 
paradise, "I went in that day to hit him with everything I had, 
but did not find him...." 
  Arciniega admits that the first steps taken by the Fujimori 
Government were positive, but only until just before the 5 April 
1992 coup. On that date, with the support of the military, the 
chief of state dissolved Parliament and assumed 
extraconstitutional powers. 
  The former military official maintains that the drug 
traffickers are the biggest capitalists in the world and that 
they are capable of exerting their influence all over the world. 
  When asked whether he knew of the existence of a list of 
persons presumably connected with drug trafficking, a list which 
the then American undersecretary of state for Latin American 
affairs, Bernard Aronson, had brought to Peru the very day of 
the coup, Arciniega said, "I understand that that story has come 
out in a book." [passages omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Are Partners"] </F>
  [Text] When he arrived in our country Alexander Watson, the 
U.S. assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, said: "We 
have to work together, as partners, to meet the challenges 
confronting us, such as the scourge of drug trafficking." 
  This is precisely how it should be. Heroin consumption, for 
example, is on the increase in the United States. This in turn 
triggers the spread of poppy fields in Peru--in Cajamarca, 
Amazonas, part of San Martin, and Madre de Dios--thus creating 
problems that our country did not have before. 
  Despite this, rules should be set on how and where this 
joint 
collaboration is to be undertaken. With regard to coca, two 
special reports published by EXPRESO this week clearly state 
that the interdiction policy furthered by the Peruvian Armed 
Forces in the Huallaga region has been quite successful, so much 
so that it has caused the price of a kilogram of cocaine paste 
to plummet from $1,500 in 1993 to its current value of $200. 
  The cultivation of traditional crops like rice, corn, and 
cotton has been partially resumed thanks to the reopening of 
highways. This has nonetheless been a very difficult decision, 
as it entailed the impoverishment of farmers. 
  It goes without saying that the decline in the coca business 
in the Huallaga region does not necessarily mean that it has 
been reduced in the whole of Peru. It has shifted toward other 
areas, with resulting effects in terms of environmental 
devastation and corruption. The government has, however, 
already launched a thrust against drug kingpins. The capture of 
"El Vaticano" has been a great step forward. 
  What merits highlighting for the purpose of our discussion 
is 
that both the mass exodus of drug traffickers from the Huallaga 
region--the leading coca production center in Peru--and the 
arrest of "El Vaticano" took place precisely during the year in 
which the United States withdrew nearly all its aid for the 
fight against drug trafficking. The effort has, therefore, been 
made by Peru--only by Peru. This all goes to prove that, at 
least on a short term basis, one obtains better results without 
U.S. aid than with it. 
  Does this mean that all joint endeavors should be left 
aside? 
Not necessarily. It means that this concerted effort ought to 
revolve around crop substitution rather than interdiction or 
police-related considerations. Peru has managed, of late, to 
develop a relatively advanced, shrewd, and intelligent 
technology that is also respectful of human rights. In this 
area, we would rather work on our own. We do, however, need 
financial resources for crop substitution programs, especially 
as we are channeling all our resources into drug enforcement 
operations. 
  These kinds of subjects are, incidentally, what the two 
partners should today be discussing.

  [Text] Following the death of drug kingpin Pablo Escobar 
Gaviria and the arrest of Peruvian drug trafficker Demetrio 
Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," the Cali cartel's 
main cocaine base paste supplier, a new and major matter of 
concern has surfaced in the struggle against drug trafficking. 
  The discovery of poppy plantations in various areas of 
northern Peru is a warning of the serious repercussions this 
psychotropic plant can have at various national levels if it 
ever replaces coca cultivation. 
  A shift in the production line of the major drug trafficking 
mafias not only warns us about the implication this may have in 
our economy, taking into account that 15 to 25 percent of our 
currency is generated by drug trafficking, but also in the 
national pacification plan's objectives. 
  The subject is alarming for several reasons that are quite 
obvious and that place coca cultivation at a disadvantage with 
cultivation of poppy, which is a narcotic. 
  Poppy, which in the 40's was found in Bambamarca (Cajamarca 
Province) is used to produce opium, which, in turn, is used to 
produce heroin, which in clandestine markets in the United 
States and Europe is sold for prices much higher than cocaine. 
  While a kilo of this product is not worth more than $23,000 
in Miami, the same quantity of heroin costs $150,000. 
  Another reason why poppy might replace coca is the 
advantages 
it offers in its cultivation. 
  Poppy grows in the same type of soil coca does. There is 
this type of soil all along the eastern and western slopes of 
the Peruvian Andes mountain range. The Cajamarca and Amazonas 
valleys are the best areas. 
  According to technical research, while 22,000 coca plants 
grow per each cultivated hectare, 160,000 poppy plants grow in 
the same cultivated surface. 
  The significant price reduction in cocaine base paste during 
the past few years is another good reason why 120,000 coca 
growers may shift to poppy cultivation. 
  Experts on the matter such as Ricardo Soberon Garrido 
maintain that the people who promote the cultivation of poppy 
are allegedly the same people who deal with cocaine, maintaining 
the same structure and working system. In this sense, they 
assure the peasant they will buy the harvest and finance the 
sowing. 
  Soberon, member of the Andean Jurists Commission, believes 
the way to prevent the spread of poppy cultivation is by 
granting commercial aid and infrastructure to those communities 
liable to receive poppy seed, as has been detected in Upper 
Huallaga. 
  As for the government proposal to punish poppy growers with 
a 
20-year prison sentence, Soberon says the Penal Code does not 
solve the cultivation problem; quite the contrary, it increases 
the prices at the cultivation sites, the price of bribes, and 
encourages cultivation in more inhospitable and ecologically 
vulnerable regions. "This neither persuades nor dissuades the 
producer who has to survive." 
  According to Law No. 26223 (latest amendment to the Penal 
Code), whoever, by threats or for illegal purposes, forces 
another individual to grow cocaine or poppy plants will receive 
a life sentence. 
  According to Soberon, this falls within the framework of the 
"Fujimori doctrine" that regards the peasants involved in coca 
growing as victims of the social and economic circumstances in 
which they are involved and not as a level of the drug 
trafficking chain. 
  In Soberon's opinion, it is easy to predict that the new 
potential poppy growers will be the same individuals who grew 
coca. The product's price is the simple reason for this. 
  As for the reasons the government seeks to severely repress 
poppy growers, Soberon believes it is not the type of drug 
(cocaine and heroin) but rather the act of drug trafficking that 
must determine the degree of the sentence. 
  According to research by Adolfo Alcantara Vasquez, of the 
Interior Ministry Executive Agency for Drug Control (Ofecod), 
the country is at the right moment to start campaigns to prevent 
poppy cultivation. 
  Vasquez maintains that the strategy for this would be to 
develop alternative projects designed to create areas to contain 
its expansion, thus preventing the soil's deterioration. 
  He recommends that the National Police Antidrug Division, 
Dirandro, propose the creation of an office designed to spot the 
areas where poppy cultivation is developing. 
  Vasquez ended by stating that having determined that poppy 
is 
more profitable than coca cultivation and that coca farmers are 
still critically poor, the poppy cultivation problem should be 
taken seriously.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Lima EXPRESO in Spanish on 25 January 
publishes on pages A8 and A9 a 1500-word article by Liz Mineo on 
the threat of poppy crops expanding throughout Peruvian 
territory. 
  The article cites Adolfo Alcantara Vazquez, an adviser at 
the 
Executive Agency for Drug Control (Ofecod) of the Interior 
Ministry, who notes that the draft law punishing poppy growers 
with up to 20 years' imprisonment will not be a deterrent, 
because the threat will persist as long as the peasants living 
in poverty in the Sierra and Jungle regions are left unattended. 
  The author notes: "Alcantara said that the danger of 
expansion of poppy crops poses a serious challenge to the 
government, because `conditions are already ripe' for this to 
happen. He notes that the difficult situation of coca growers, 
the huge profits yielded by opium and heroin on the drug market, 
and the variety of climates existing in the Peruvian Sierra and 
Jungle regions may contribute to unleashing a poppy `boom' in 
the country." 
  The article says that the first confiscation of opium in the 
country occurred more than a month ago when the Chiclayo police 
seized 4 kg of a "strange substance" from two suspects, who 
claimed to have brought the opium from Bagua, Amazonas. 
  The article adds that, in a recent visit, EXPRESO reporters 
were able to confirm police reports that since mid-1993 
Colombian and Peruvian drug traffickers have been training 
peasants to grow poppies in some areas of Cajamarca, Amazonas, 
and San Martin Departments. 
  "It is feared that the collapse of coca crops in the 
Huallaga 
region, where nearly 200,000 farmers earn their living by 
growing coca leaves and making cocaine base, could pave the way 
for a boom in poppy growing." 
  Citing Huallaga residents, the article says that peasants 
are 
openly willing to grow poppies in light of the fact that 
Colombian traffickers "promised to pay them $1,500 per kg of 
opium, which is seven times what they would get for 1 kg of 
cocaine paste." 
  After citing the advantages of growing poppies instead of 
coca, such as the fact that poppies are easier to grow and 
harder to detect from the air, that opium requires much less 
processing than cocaine, and that heroin consumption is rising 
while cocaine consumption is declining on the U.S. market, the 
article cites experts stating that the Cajamarca, Apurimac, 
Urubamba, and Amazonas valleys would be ideal locations for 
poppy crops. By contrast, they note that poppies grow only in 
the Alto Biavo and Alto Mayo areas in San Martin Department, 
which is the largest coca production region in the country. 
  The article concludes by stating that "everything leads one 
to believe that it will be very difficult to prevent poppy crops 
from expanding in the country." Alcantara says: "We are 
already the world's leading producer of coca, and we could also 
become the leading producer of poppies."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Lima EXPRESO in Spanish on 19 January on 
pages 14 and 15 carries a 900-word article by Liz Mineo on the 
serious crisis affecting San Martin Department due to the 
reduction of drug trafficking activities in Huallaga in the last 
few months. 
  Peasants are learning a hard lesson because they cannot sell 
drugs due to the shortage of flights and low prices; therefore, 
they have discovered that "coca is no longer the remedy for all 
their ills." A peasant in the Tres Unidos settlement, 250 km 
from Tarapoto, said: "When I was growing corn or yucca I could 
eat them if I did not sell them. But if I don't sell coca I 
cannot eat it." 
  The great majority of peasants in Huallaga abandoned 
agricultural production to grow coca and make cocaine base, 
which was more profitable and easier to sell. During the 
1991-1992 agricultural season in San Martin Department, peasants 
planted 16,524 hectares of corn, which was about half the area 
planted the year before. 
  Coffee production was affected most, dropping from 3,149 
hectares in the 1990-1991 harvest to 143 hectares the year 
after. The same thing happened with beans, dropping from 3,945 
hectares in 1990-1991 to 1,388 hectares the next season. Even 
banana production dropped considerably. A Juanjui peasant said: 
"In the jungle we were eating bananas grown in the coastal 
region. We were all going crazy growing coca." 
  Although coca fever has not ended, police were able to 
reduce 
drug trafficking activities in Huallaga, thus reducing drug 
prices considerably. Tingo de Ponaza Mayor Enrique Reategui 
said: "Peasants now are more willing to grow other products 
because coca growing has become risky and not very profitable." 
  During the 1992-1993 agricultural season, peasants planted 
34,443 hectares of rice; two years ago it was only 22,723 
hectares. During the same season, peasants planted 18,753 
hectares of corn, which was 13.5 percent higher than the year 
before. Cotton production also increased considerably, going 
from only 53 hectares in 1991-1992 to 1,173 hectares. One 
Taraporo peasant said: "We will continue growing coca but we 
are back growing corn, bananas, and yucca to have something to 
eat when we are not able to sell coca." 
  Some people believe the increased rice and corn cultivation 
is a demonstration of agricultural reactivation in San Martin. 
One of the most optimistic is Gonzalo Villavicencio, president 
of the San Martin Regional Government, who said: "Agriculture 
is in full reactivation because there is greater support by the 
government and a trend by peasants to get on the legal path." 
  Many peasants have abandoned coca growing, but many more are 
willing to begin poppy growing because it is more profitable 
than traditional crops, the article concludes.

  [Text] A high-ranking officer at the Santa Lucia police 
base has reported that a group of peasant patrols located in 
Peru's coca-producing regions is offering protection to drug 
traffickers operating in these areas, in exchange for large sums 
of money. 
  The police officer, who asked not to be identified, added 
that in view of this it is very likely that the peasant patrol 
members will refuse to hand over the guns that were supplied to 
them by the government to protect their towns against terrorists. 
  He said that the Peasant Patrols have cooperated actively in 
the pacification of the country, and that through their active 
presence Shining Path and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement] lost a great deal of their prevalence. 
  He said that, unfortunately, the strong economic incentive 
offered by drug traffickers for looking after coca farms allows 
the peasant patrols to improve their standards of living, while 
no alternative development programs have been promoted for 
cultivating other products instead of coca. 
  Moreover, intelligence service reports state that there are 
bad armed forces and police officers detached in the area who 
are also offering protection to drug traffickers in exchange for 
money. 
  The staff at the Santa Lucia base, which was built with the 
DEA's support to combat drug trafficking in the Upper Huallaga 
region, is already aware of the situation. 
  As an example of these charges, the police officer said that 
the peasant patrols in Palmapampa, in La Mar Province, Ayacucho 
Department, "do not allow the police to enter the area, and 
openly support drug traffickers."

  [Text] People sentenced for drug trafficking will be able 
to get the penitentiary benefits of semi-freedom and early 
release as well as the redemption of their penalty through work 
and education "as long as it is the first sentence of a loss of 
freedom." 
  This was established in a draft law submitted by the 
executive branch to Congress for urgent discussion. The bill is 
already in the Justice Committee, whose members must meet in the 
next few days to decide on the proposal. 
  According to the bill, in the case of redemption of penalty 
through work and education, it will be at the rate of one day of 
penalty for two of effective work for those found in possession 
of up to 200 grams of cocaine or its byproducts. For those 
arrested in possession of larger quantities, it will be one day 
of penalty for five days of education or effective work. 
  The bill also considers the possibility that a process ends 
ahead of time at the initiative of the Attorney General's Office 
or the individual being processed. If the initiative comes from 
the one being processed, he will get the benefit of a one-sixth 
reduction of penalty. The benefit is an addition and will be 
added to the benefit received by confession. 
  The bill adds a clause to the Civil Code establishing that a 
"small quantity of drug" will be considered up to 200 grams of 
cocaine and its byproducts, 100 grams of cocaine hydrochloride, 
500 grams of marijuana, and 50 grams of its byproducts. 
  The bill also changes Article 299 of the Penal Code, 
allowing 
that drug addicts not be considered traffickers after a legal 
medical checkup and if they were arrested with less than five 
grams of cocaine. 
  Another draft law that also was submitted by the executive 
branch to Congress includes the cultivation of poppy as a crime 
of illegal drug trafficking, establishing severe punishment for 
those who grow it. 
  In the reasons for this bill the executive branch warns that 
the introduction of poppy in Peru is a serious threat not only 
to our institutional stability but also to the community due to 
the harm caused by the psychoactive substances derived from it. 
  Taking into account the problem's seriousness, the bill 
excludes those processed or sentenced for cultivating poppy from 
the penitentiary benefits, either early release or executive 
branch pardon. 
  The proposal only has four articles, establishing that "the 
one who cultivates poppy, and promotes, facilitates, or finances 
the cultivation of poppy will be punished with imprisonment of 
not less than 12 years and not more than 20 years." If the 
quantity of poppy plants does not exceed 100, the violator will 
be punished with not less than eight years and not more than 15 
years. 
  The bill also establishes that all poppy cultivations will 
be 
destroyed by any means in the presence of a provincial 
prosecutor, the land will be transferred to the state, and the 
equipment and other supplies used in the cultivation will be 
confiscated.

  [Text] Huanuco, 26 Jan -- General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza 
Rios, chairman of the Armed Forces Joint Command, yesterday 
revealed that 30 military officers were charged in 1993 in 
military courts for their involvement in drug trafficking. He 
noted that stiff prison sentences have already been handed down 
on 13 of these officers. 
  Gen. Hermoza made these remarks at a time when press reports 
link trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano, with 
senior Army officers assigned to the Huallaga Front. 
  Gen. Hermoza, who is also the Army commander, has flatly 
denied these reports. He did not rule out, however, the 
possibility that ongoing military court investigations may yield 
some results. 
  He said: I can tell you that 13 officers who were convicted 
for their ties with drug traffickers are currently serving stiff 
prison sentences. 
  He added that charges have been filed against 17 other 
officers for their involvement in the illegal drug trade. These 
officers are standing trial and will soon be sentenced. 
  Regarding the responsibility of the Army and the other 
services in these cases, Hermoza made it clear that these 
isolated cases will in no way tarnish the image of the Armed 
Forces because they uphold unshakeable patriotic principles. 
  He again contended that there are only isolated crimes 
committed by military personnel and that these cases do not 
undermine morale within the security forces. 
  Gen. Hermoza said this after a quick tour of Tarapoto, Tingo 
Maria, and Huanuco, where the drug trade has expanded to every 
sector. 
  Foreign and Peruvian journalists alike have repeatedly 
reported that some Army officers are collecting bribes from 
traffickers to allow them to ship their illegal merchandise. 
  General Alfredo Rodriguez Riveros, the new 
political-military 
chief of the Huallaga Front, has announced that a special 
battalion led by Peruvian Army commander "Arturo" has been 
created to fight the traffickers, "who are close allies of the 
Shining Path." 
  Gen. Rodriguez added that the Army is currently using 
electronic devices that are used in times of war to investigate, 
identify, and rigorously and forcefully bring to trial--just as 
it does with terrorists--any officers engaged in crime. 
  Gen. Rodriguez said the Army Inspector's Office is using 
taped reports and all other evidence available in intelligence 
work to identify those officers who may be involved in this 
serious crime. 
  Gen. Hermoza noted that in the past there was only one 
inspector handling this type of problem in the Huallaga Front. 
  Hermoza added: Today I have assigned four colonel-inspectors 
with their respective aides to monitor the activities of 
military personnel assigned to that zone. 
  Hermoza emphatically stated that military criminals will be 
punished as severely as common criminals. 
  Hermoza also briefly commented on a document recently 
published by LA REPUBLICA containing a message from Abimael 
Guzman to his followers. 
  Gen. Hermoza ruled out the possibility that the Shining Path 
will hold its Second National Congress. 
  Hermoza stated that when communists analyze both objective 
and subjective conditions they will realize that they have no 
chance of winning. 
  He added: Besides, they have already lost international 
support and are lacking what they call "leadership" because 
their leaders, who are imprisoned at the Callao Naval Base, now 
have no control over their followers. 
  This is why, he said, through an adequate intelligence work, 
our security forces have managed to arrest more terrorists. 
  He said the "Peace Accord" between the government and 
Shining 
Path is a political subject. 
  Hermoza added that a political war is now being waged. He 
said every sector of national life is participating in this war, 
which should be named "Pacification." 
  Hermoza reiterated that the Shining Path extremist 
organization has absolutely no chance of carrying out an 
activity like its Second National Congress. 
  Commenting on the presentation to the media of 18 "confirmed 
terrorist criminals" at the Huanuco-based "Los Avelinos" 
barracks, Hermoza emphasized that these criminals were unharmed, 
that they do not have a single scratch. 
  Raising his voice, Hermoza rhetorically asked: Where are the 
human rights organizations? Why have they not commented on the 
number of skilled terrorist criminals who have been arrested in 
the past two years without having suffered a single scratch? 
  This, he said, is one of the many indicators of the way 
human 
rights is being respected in the country.

<F P=106> [Article by Sherie-Ann de Leon] </F>
  [Text] The power to seize large sums of cash without making 
an arrest or laying a charge, is one of the main features of the 
new Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Bill 1993, laid in Parliament 
last week. 
  The proposed hard-hitting anti-drug legislation, which is 
designed to give "teeth" to the existing Dangerous Drugs Act 
1991 will give powers to Police, Customs and Coast Guard 
officers to seize cash being imported or exported; to stop, 
board, search, detain, or divert ships; to arrest without 
warrant; and to appoint civilians to assist with drug busts at 
sea. 
  The Bill was laid quietly in the Senate on Monday while the 
Upper House was engaged in debate on the Petrotrin merger and in 
the Lower House on Friday during the Budget Debate. A limited 
number of copies was distributed only to members of both Houses. 
  The Bill is closely patterned after the British Criminal 
Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990, which was 
specially drafted to enable the United Kingdom to ratify the 
1988 United Nations (Vienna) Convention Against Illicit Traffic 
in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Even so, a few 
sections which are important for the investigation of money 
laundering activities in the UK have been omitted from the local 
Bill. 
  The proposed amendments would improve on existing 
legislation 
by expressly making money laundering an offence--laundering 
one's own drug money is still legal in this country according to 
the 1991 Act. 
  The Government hopes that new laws would remove existing 
impediments to the prosecution of drug offenders, and cure 
deficiencies related to the confiscation and forfeiture (by 
local and foreign courts) of the proceeds of drug trafficking. 
  If accepted and passed by the required special majority of 
three-fifths of the members of each House, the Bill could prove 
to be a major tool in the war against financiers and 
beneficiaries of the drug trade. 
  It makes extensive provisions for the execution of 
confiscation orders, whether made by local or foreign courts. 
This is hoped to reap heavy financial benefits from nationals 
convicted of drug trafficking in foreign countries. 
  It provides for onward extradition, in which a person's 
return to a foreign territory shall not be debarred only because 
the person will be sent from that territory to another, to stand 
trial for an offence. 
  This clause attempts to rectify a deficiency in existing law 
which led to the freeing of three Trinidadians in 1986, after 
attempts to have them extradited to England failed because they 
were really wanted in connection with a heroin-trafficking 
operation in the Golden Triangle. 
  An offence of conspiracy to commit drug-related offences has 
been created under the proposed legislation. Any person who 
aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of any offence 
under the Act would also be guilty of an offence and is to be 
liable on conviction to the same penalty as the principal 
offender. 
  The proposed Bill targets those who work for drug barons by 
laundering the proceeds of drug trafficking, with intent to help 
the trafficker to elude prosecution for a drug trafficking 
offence, or avoid the enforcement of a confiscation order in 
respect of his illegally acquired proceeds. 
  It provides for the prosecution of those who conceal or 
disguise property derived from the proceeds of drug trafficking. 
Anyone who converts, transfers or disposes of that property, or 
removes it from the jurisdiction to assist the trafficker, is 
also guilty of an offence and can be fined between $50,000 and 
$100,000 and imprisoned for five to 10 years. 
  Unlike the British Act, however, the local Bill does not 
make 
the concealing of information (or providing false information) 
about money laundering an offence. Under the British Act, 
references to concealing or disguising property include 
references to concealing or disguising the nature, source, 
location, disposition, movement or ownership or any rights with 
respect to the "laundered" property. 
  The local Bill provides a kind of amnesty for professionals 
(bankers and attorneys, for example) involved in laundering 
money for traffickers if they voluntarily disclose information 
about the illegal activity. This is subject to conditions that 
the disclosure is made before the act is done and the act is 
done with the consent of a police officer, or the disclosure is 
made after he does the act, but on his initiative and as soon as 
it is reasonable for him to make it. 
  The local Bill also makes it an offence for a person to 
receive, possess or convert money or property, knowing that such 
money or property was derived from drug trafficking activities. 
This clause targets those who provide services or goods which 
are of assistance to the trafficker in his illegal activities; 
or those who knowingly purchase property for "next to nothing" 
or accept gifts from drug barons. It is a defence under the Bill 
to prove that the property was acquired for adequate 
consideration (equal to the market value of the property). 
  One of the more far-reaching clauses gives a Customs or 
Police officer the authority to seize and detain any cash being 
imported or exported, if he has reasonable grounds for 
suspecting that it directly or indirectly represents any 
person's proceeds of, or is intended to be used in any drug 
transaction. 
  This clause seeks to trap hundreds of people who pass 
through 
the airports and other ports each year, carrying large sums of 
local and foreign currency. 
  In previous years, anyone found carrying cash exceeding 
limits stipulated by Central Bank's foreign exchange policy, 
could have been arrested and charged under the Customs Act. But 
since the dollar was floated in April this year, law enforcement 
officers have had no jurisdiction to even question the origin of 
huge sums of currency. 
  Under the proposed laws, seized cash can be held for an 
initial 48-hour period, but its continued detention can be 
authorised by a magistrate. The detention order can only last 
for three months at a time, but can be renewed and have effect 
for up to two years once the magistrate is satisfied that there 
are reasonable grounds for the suspicion that the money is 
drug-related and that the detention is justified while the 
origin or derivation of the cash is further investigated.

  [Text] Witnesses in drug cases in Trinidad and Tobago are 
so easily bought off that the Ministry of National Security is 
putting focus on the seizure of drugs outside of Trinidad and 
Tobago as a deliberate policy. 
  This was stated by National Security Minister Russell 
Huggins 
in the Senate yesterday. 
  Noting that there was criticism that the big drug busts were 
not taking place in Trinidad and Tobago, but outside, Huggins 
said the seizing of drugs outside of Trinidad was "an 
intentional act." 
  "Witnesses (in Trinidad and Tobago) are being bought off as 
easy as it is to buy a soft drink in a parlour. We start a case, 
we have four state witnesses and by the time the matter comes 
up, you can't find any of them. They are in the United States 
living it up," he said. 
  He explained that as a result of this the Ministry had taken 
a particular approach to the busting of drug deals. 
  "When we find out about it (we arrange) to have it seized 
outside of Trinidad and not inside," he said, adding: 
  "We will work with agencies outside of Trinidad and Tobago 
and I can tell you that it was largely as a result of our effort 
that a drug link between this country and Venezuela was 
destroyed recently." 
  Huggins noted that one of the main perpetrators, a 
Trinidadian received a 10-year jail sentence within eight days 
of his arrest. 
  "Now that is the kind of swift justice I will like to see 
here. But we have skilled lawyers who know how to delay justice 
when it suits them," he added. 
  The Minister also referred to a recent bust "as far as 
Holland" in which both the narcotic units here and the OSS 
(Organisation of Strategic Services) played an important role in 
the discovery of shipment of drugs on board a British Airways 
craft leaving Piarco. 
  Huggins noted that the task of preventing drugs from coming 
into Trinidad and Tobago was far more difficult. Those who 
import cocaine have a lot of opportunity to do so, he said, 
adding that the south-eastern coast, given the present size of 
our Coast Guard, was impossible to patrol on a full-time basis. 
  He recalled that only recently the Coast Guard had acquired 
boats with the capability to chase the small fast boats used by 
drug traffickers. 
  Turning to the Point Lisas Port, he noted that it was 
virtually impossible to search 1,000 containers. 
  "The only way you can do it is by random checks and a 
container may slip by and the government and the security at 
Point Lisas are blamed," he noted. 
  He said that while Point Lisas had put in a very good system 
to deal with that, it was virtually impossible to completely 
eradicate the problem. 
  He stressed that good intelligence in detecting the drugs 
was 
still the best option and urged citizens to assist the 
authorities in this regard. 
  Huggins said the U.S. Government had provided govenrment 
with 
US$303,000; the Canadian Government $1 million, the French 
Government had given technical assistance as did the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police. 
  But, he stressed, foreign assistance was extremely difficult 
to access. "Although public pronouncements are made that some 
governments are providing assistance, because of the bureaucracy 
involved, that assistance is extremely difficult to get our 
hands on," he said. 
  He said on regional basis--Caribbean Financial Action Task 
Force--was established to deal with the problem of money 
laundering.

  [Text] (Sonia Ciambatti), former magistrate of the Supreme 
Court of Justice, said that the executive branch, through the 
Central Bank of Venezuela, will begin operating a data base that 
will allow the detection and neutralization of money transfers 
linked to drug trafficking activities that are coming into the 
country from overseas. (Ciambatti) made the announcement within 
the framework of a conference in Caracas on U.S. experiences in 
fighting money laundering in the United States. 
  If money laundering is not eradicated, it is capable of 
spilling over and harming the financial system of a nation, 
because people involved in money laundering take advantage of 
the system for their own benefit. According to (Ciambatti), 
Venezuela has acquired international tools, such as the Vienna 
Convention and the standard regulations on the legitimization of 
capital, that enable a country to fight the crime. Establishing 
the proposed data base, therefore, will be a smooth process. 
  [Begin (Ciambatti) recording, in progress] ... so there is a 
check to allow only banking transfers and economic situations 
that are entirely legal and which benefit the country and to 
keep Venezuela from becoming a center of operations for 
international drug trafficking activities. [end recording]

  [Summary] Yunnan's public security apparatus on 1 October 
1993 began a special effort against narcotics and weapons 
trafficking. Since October, public security components 
throughout the province have emphasized investigating and 
solving cases. By 31 October, they had solved 3358 cases of all 
types, of which 1224 were major cases, achieving a success rate 
of 76 percent and apprehending 4233 criminals. In the special 
effort, public security components have solved 463 narcotics 
cases, seizing 303.3 kg of heroin and other refined narcotics 
and 190.1 kg of opium. They have also seized 180 guns of all 
types and 663 rounds of ammunition.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN GONGAN BAO reporter Sun Baoye (1327 1405 0673), </F>
staff correspondent Li Bingtian (2621 3521 1131) and staff 
reporter Sun Chunying (1327 2504 5391): "Eradicate All Vices--a 
Record of How Guns and Drugs Are Seized in the Southwest Border 
Areas"--first three grafs are FAZHI RIBAO introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Material provided by authoritative departments 
shows that gun and drug trafficking in the southwest border 
areas has tended to become increasingly rampant. Despite a 
sustained, continuous, and severe crackdown on such activities, 
they are still spreading. 
  In 1992, the public security organs of Yunnan and Guangxi 
Provinces uncovered 36 armed drug trafficking gangs. The 
gangsters openly resisted inspection and arrest. Gun fights 
occurred on several occasions and seven policemen and officers 
died while 26 were wounded. 
  Guns and drugs originate from the same source and go side by 
side. Drug trafficking protected by gun trafficking has 
gradually become more conspicuous and there is no end of trouble 
for the future. The Ministry of Public Security has determined 
to adopt extraordinary measures and will strive to stop the 
smuggling of guns and drugs within the boundary of the southwest 
border areas within three years in a bid to provide a basic 
solution to the problem of gun and drug trafficking. 
I. [Roman one] Guns and Drugs Come From Abroad and Are 
Trafficked Everywhere in China [subhead] 
  China's southwest borders on the world's biggest source of 
drug production, the "golden triangle." In the past few years, 
the area of land growing opium poppies in the "golden triangle" 
has been enlarging. The output of opium has constantly 
increased and drug processing has developed very rapidly. In 
1992, the output of opium was already as high as 2,500 tonnes 
and there were more than 60 heroin processing plants. The 
international drug trafficking syndicates have tried by every 
means to open up a "passageway in China." Some lawbreakers in 
China have put money before everything else, colluded with drug 
lords outside our borders, taken part in the transfer of drugs, 
and aggravated the vicious development of drug trafficking. 
Armed separatist regimes in Burma regard drug trafficking as 
the main source of their operational funds and the amounts of 
drugs entering China from Vietnam and Laos are increasing. This 
has resulted in the expansion of the drug "market" and has 
abetted the development of drug trafficking in China. According 
to statistics, in the early 1980's, the number of drug 
trafficking cases cracked in China was less than 1,000 a year 
but in 1992, the number of drug trafficking cases cracked 
reached as many as 14,000. 
  Guns and drugs originate from the same source and they go 
side by side. Because of war and armed separatist regimes, a 
large number of military weapons are scattered among the people 
in Vietnam, Laos, and Burma and these guns are sold in the 
border areas of China. Some domestic criminals and criminal 
gangs in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan have tried very hard to 
obtain guns from the southwest border areas in China. According 
to statistics, 1,205 cases of gun trafficking occurred across 
the country in 1992, of which 464 were filed in Yunnan, Guangxi, 
and Hainan, accounting for 39 percent of the total. 
  According to reports, half of the military weapons seized in 
Yunnan Province in 1993 came from the Sino-Vietnamese border 
areas. [passage omitted] 
II. [Roman two] The Criminal Gangs Have Combined Supply, 
Transportation, and Sales [subhead] 
  The amount of weapons and drugs trafficked by individuals is 
far less than that by criminal gangs. At present, most gun and 
drug trafficking activities are international criminal 
activities. Domestic criminals have colluded with criminals 
outside to form professional and international syndicates and 
they have combined supply, transportation, and sales. This has 
an abominable impact on the society. 
  [Passage omitted] It is said that a considerable amount of 
drugs are sold to Taiwan via the mainland. On 13 May 1993, a 
border defense detachment in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, found 36 
kg of heroin on a Taiwan ship. The heroin originated in the 
southwest border areas. 
  The Longgang Border Defense Station in Shantou, Guangdong 
Province, unexpectedly seized during inspection 34.2 kg of drugs 
on a Taiwan fishing boat. [passage omitted] 
  In 1992, Yunnan cracked 15 major cases of heroin 
trafficking, 
in each of which over 30 kg of heroin was seized. All such 
heroin trafficking was carried out by criminal gangs. 
III. [Roman three] The Southwest Border Areas Have Become 
"Areas Seriously Infested" With Gun and Drug Trafficking: "When 
the City Gate Catches Fire, the Fish in the Moat Suffer" 
[subhead] 
  The boundary line between Yunnan and Guangxi on the one side 
and the neighboring countries on the other is very strange. A 
road, a small river, or a low bank of earth between fields can 
be a national boundary. The national boundary even passes 
through a building and one part of the building is in one 
country and the other part in the other. When the local people 
start cooking their meals and find they have no more soya sauce, 
they can go and buy soya sauce from the other country and return 
to continue their cooking. It can thus be seen that under such 
circumstances, infiltration can hardly be prevented. Much less 
is it easy to stop the activities of international criminal 
syndicates which are trying to open up a passage, an entrepot 
market, and a consumers market in China in an organized and 
premeditated manner. 
  According to reports, gun and drug trafficking in the border 
areas of Yunnan and Guangxi is very conspicuous and such areas 
have become the most seriously infested gun and drug trafficking 
areas in China at present in terms not only of the increasing 
number of gun and drug cases but also of the abrupt growth in 
the number of major cases. 
  According to reports, in 1992, the public security organs 
cracked 5,609 drug trafficking cases in Yunnan and Guangxi, 14 
percent more than the previous year and accounting for 38.2 
percent of the total number of drug trafficking cases in China; 
3,974 kg of heroin was seized, 1.5 times more than in the 
previous year and accounting for 88.5 percent of the total 
amount seized in China; and 1,190 military weapons were seized, 
1.9 times that in the previous year and accounting for 80 
percent of the total seized in China. From January to December 
1993, the number of military weapons seized by the public 
security and border defense departments in Guangxi was more than 
2 times over that for the whole of 1992. In Yunnan alone, 68 
major cases of drug trafficking involving over 10 kg of drugs 
each were cracked in 1992, 84 percent above the previous year; 
and from January to September 1993, 81 major cases of this kind 
were cracked, 20 cases more than the same period the previous 
year. [passage omitted] 
IV. [Roman four] Gun and Drug Trafficking Has Led to a Lot of 
Problems in Social Order [subhead] 
  The easy access to guns and drugs in the southwest border 
areas has led to a series of problems in social order: 
  The number of drug addicts has increased by a large amount. 
In 1992, over 40,000 drug addicts were registered in Yunnan and 
Guangxi. 
  Gun trafficking, drug trafficking, and drug abuse have 
induced a rise in various other criminal cases in the border 
areas. In 1992, the shocking number of nearly 100,000 criminal 
cases occurred in Guangxi. 
  Drug trafficking has caused serious damage to the national 
economy in the border areas. In 1992, over 100 million yuan 
flew out of the country because of drug trafficking. 
  Large stockpiles of guns held in the border areas in the 
course of drug trafficking have become an extremely important 
hidden danger to local social order. The rising prices of guns 
will also increase by a big margin the number of cases of 
illegal manufacture of guns. 
  [Passage omitted] In China, the number of criminal cases 
involving the use of guns has increased annually and the number 
of cases where guns have been used to murder or rob has 
increased by a big margin. This is directly related to the 
rampant gun trafficking activities in the southwest border 
areas. The gun used in the "1.31" case to kill a Beijing taxi 
driver in March 1993 was bought in Yunnan. In 1992, several 
hundred cases of using guns to commit crime occurred in 
Guangdong and Hainan. Of the 130 military weapons seized in 
Guangzhou City alone, 72 were bought by criminals from Guangxi, 
34 from Vietnam, and six from Yunnan. 
  At present, over 600 cities and counties have discovered 
drugs or guns trafficked from Yunnan or Guangxi. Some of them 
have gone to Hong Kong and Macao for bank robberies and 
kidnappings. This has not only adversely affected the social 
order of Hong Kong and Macao, but also seriously damaged China's 
image. 
  [Passage omitted] It is high time we resolutely made our 
minds up to thoroughly resolve the problem of gun and drug 
trafficking in the southwest border areas. At the beginning of 
1993, Tao Siju, minister of public security, chaired two 
ministerial work meetings to specially study work in this 
respect. In June 1993, the Ministry of Public Security held a 
work meeting on seizing guns and drugs in the southwest border 
areas and explicitly put forward the task of adopting an 
extraordinary attitude and measures and striving to basically 
stop guns and drugs from entering the territory within three 
years.

Gun and Drug Trafficking in Border Areas of Yunnan and Guangxi 
[subhead] 
  [passage omitted] 
VI. [Roman six] Work To Seize Guns and Drugs Develops With 
Irresistible Force [subhead] 
  In the fight against gun and drug trafficking, the public 
security and border defense departments of Yunnan and Guangxi 
Provinces have mobilized the strength of the whole society and 
have waged a people's war with great efforts. At present, a 
struggle by the masses of people to seize guns and drugs has 
been extensively launched in the southwest border areas. There 
have been numerous incidents of people reporting information 
about drug crimes and assisting public security organs to arrest 
criminals. On 31 August 1993, after a village cadre of Fengyi 
Town, Dali City, Yunnan, discovered a drug trafficker, more than 
50 common people helped the policemen to search the hills 
despite the rain. They arrested the criminal and seized 6.8 kg 
of heroin. Since June 1993, the public security and border 
defense departments have received 213 reports on gun trafficking 
made by the common people. Thanks to these reports, 12 military 
weapons and several handgrenades were seized and 15 gun 
traffickers were arrested. 
  Since the June 1993 Ministry of Public Security meeting on 
work to seize guns and drugs in the southwest borders, reports 
on victories scored by the "three defense lines" in the 
southwest border areas have come one after another: 
  On 28 June, the Dongfengqiao Checkpoint at Baoshan, Yunnan 
Province, seized 3.6 kg of opium from a car from Tengchong and 
arrested a drug trafficker. 
  On 13 July, the Longzhou Border Defense Headquarters in 
Guangxi Province cracked a gun trafficking case and seized a 
U.S. weapon, 40 rounds of ammunition, and a handgrenade. 
  In eight days from 3 to 10 August, the Nasuo Public Security 
Border Defense Checkpoint in Guangxi cracked seven gun 
trafficking cases, seized 10 military weapons and 12 antitank 
grenades, and arrested 14 gun traffickers. The checkpoint also 
cracked a drug trafficking case, seizing 360 g of heroin and 
arresting two drug traffickers. To commend the checkpoint, the 
Ministry of Public Security awarded it the Merit Citation 2d 
Class and awarded all the personnel in the checkpoint and other 
people concerned merit citation and material rewards. 
  On 25 September, the Mengdong Border Defense Substation in 
Yunnan seized a light machine gun, a heavy machine gun, and a 
"40" [as published] rocket launcher. On 27 September, the 
Dehong Border Defense Detachment cracked a major drug 
trafficking case at Jiegao, Ruili County, and seized 14.5 kg of 
drugs. 
  By the end of September, the Yunnan Border Defense 
Headquarters had cracked 501 drug trafficking cases, of which 20 
were major cases involving 10 kg of drugs each, arrested 595 
drug traffickers, and seized over 510 kg of heroin and over 550 
kg of opium. The headquarters also had cracked 57 gun 
trafficking cases, seized 75 military weapons, 12 rocket 
launchers, and 9,789 rounds of ammunition. 
  On 15 December, the Aidian Border Defense Work Station in 
Guangxi laid an ambush on the Chinese side of a certain boundary 
tablet and seized 13 military weapons and 39 rounds of 
ammunition. 
  On 24 December, the Ningming County Border Defense 
Headquarters in Guangxi cracked a major case of gun trafficking 
and seized 10 military weapons and 40 rounds of ammunition. 
  Up to December, the Guangxi Border Defense Headquarters had 
cracked over 100 gun trafficking cases, seized over 200 military 
weapons, 845 handmade guns, 5,600 rounds of ammunition, and 146 
antitank grenades, and arrested 129 criminals. The headquarters 
had also cracked 42 drug trafficking cases, seized over 3,000 kg 
of opium and 7 kg of heroin, and arrested 50 drug traffickers.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Xu Ye (1776 0396): "Yunnan, </F>
Guangxi Make Outstanding Achievements in Seizing Guns and Drugs"] 
  [Text] Kunming, 24 January (GUANGMING RIBAO)--This 
reporter has learned from today's commendation meeting on 
struggles against the smuggling of guns and drugs called by the 
Yunnan Frontier Defense Forces of the Armed Police, that 
Minister of Public Security Tao Siju recently signed a citation 
to cite both the Yunnan and Guangxi Frontier Defense 
Headquarters for their remarkable results in struggles against 
the smuggling of guns and drugs. The two frontier defense 
headquarters each gained a Collective Award of Merit. 
  Both Yunnan and Guangxi are located on China's southwestern 
border, facing a border line as long as nearly 5,000 km. 
Lawbreakers both inside and outside the country run rampant in 
these areas, engaging in the smuggling and trafficking of guns 
and drugs. In the wake of a work conference on struggles against 
the smuggling of guns and drugs, which was called by the 
Ministry of Public Security in June 1993, the public security 
and frontier defense forces in both Yunnan and Guangxi have 
carried out special-purpose campaigns against the smuggling of 
guns and drugs in an extensive and thoroughgoing way. Officers 
and men of the armed police have overcome numerous difficulties, 
carried out hard struggles, and attained remarkable results. 
According to a briefing, the Yunnan Frontier Defense 
Headquarters has cracked a total of 218 gun-smuggling cases and 
seized 119 military guns, 3,582 grenades, and 4,605 bullets, and 
cleared up 596 drug-trafficking cases and seized 427.477 kg of 
heroin and 283.77 kg of opium. The Guangxi Frontier Defense 
Headquarters solved a total of 100 gun-smuggling cases and 
captured 208 military guns, 148 grenades, and 5,722 bullets, and 
cracked 39 drug-trafficking cases and seized 4.849 kg of heroin 
and 64.537 kg of opium.

<F P=106> [By Hedley Thomas] </F>
  [Text] A Hong Kong triad syndicate allied with mainland 
criminals in the manufacture and distribution of the synthetic 
drug "ice" has been smashed in what authorities describe as a 
major coup. A makeshift laboratory used to make the haul of 
about 22 kilograms of pure ice was discovered during raids by 
more than 40 officers from the Narcotics Bureau and the 
Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Two boys aged 
about 10 were delivered into the care of the Social Welfare 
Department yesterday after officers found them living in a Sha 
Tin flat used by members of the 14K Yee triad to manufacture and 
store the drugs. 
  "This is the first ice manufacturing case in Hong Kong for 
17 
years and the second largest seizure ever made," said Detective 
Chief Inspector Yeung Tak-keung, head of the bureau's export 
section. The ice was destined for the Philippines, where it 
would have retailed for about $10 million, compared with a Hong 
Kong wholesale value of $700,000. 
  Authorities said the busts did not indicate Hong Kong was 
becoming a burgeoning market for ice. "In the Philippines and 
Japan, ice is the drug of choice. In Hong Kong, heroin remains 
the drug of choice. Ice doesn't have a market here," said ICAC 
Chief Investigator Mike Squires. Mr Squires said four people 
arrested were members of the 14K Yee triad society whose 
official meeting place above a shop in North Poin was also 
uncovered in the raids. 
  In the past, Hong Kong has been mainly used as transit point 
for ice manufactured in laboratories in southern China and 
shipped to countries including the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan, 
South Korea and Hawaii. "We believe the syndicate has been 
active in ice trafficking for some time, but we believe we broke 
it up at the beginning of their plans to manufacture it in Hong 
Kong," Chief Inspector Yeung said. 
  He said the synthetics used to make the ice had come from a 
mainland crime group operating near Guangzhou and smuggled to 
Hong Kong for final processing in the Sha Tin flat. "They were 
importing the mixture from China and then treating it and 
combining it with other liquids in Hong Kong until it 
crystallised and was in its purest form," Chief Inspector Yeung 
said. 
  The 22 kg of ice and most of the manufacturing paraphernalia 
were found in the flat with the boys' 42-year-old mother, who 
was arrested. "The children were living in a flat used as an 
ice factory, but we do not believe they were using drugs. It's 
a pity that such things happen to them at that age," Chief 
Inspector Yeung said. Three men, including the suspected 
ringleader and self-taught chemist and two would-be couriers, 
were arrested during raids on Monday night and early yesterday 
at premises in North Point. Four machete-type knives and a 
small quantity of heroin were also seized.

  [Text] It is impossible for Thailand and other foreign 
governments to respond to a call by opium warlord Khun Sa to 
extend aid and help develop Shan state. 
  This is the response of the secretary general of the 
Narcotics Control Board, Gen Chawalit Yotmani, to Khun Sa's 
promise to stop growing poppies and operating heroin refineries. 
  Khun Sa's self-proclaimed "Independent Shan State" in Burma 
is considered illegal, and Thailand cannot cooperate with him, 
Gen Chawalit said. 
  Khun Sa still produces heroin and is the key man behind the 
narcotics trade, and Thailand will continue its suppression 
policy against the drug, he said. 
  He dismissed Khun Sa's claim that heroin is refined in the 
Golden Triangle but not in areas under his control. There are 
15-25 heroin refineries in Burma, Gen Chawalit said.

  [Text] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for International 
Narcotics Matters Robert F. Gelbard, accompanied by a group, 
paid a courtesy call this morning on Deputy Prime Minister 
Amnuai Wirawan. The deputy prime minister noted the longstanding 
good relations between Thailand and the United States, 
especially their cooperation and mutual understanding in 
narcotics suppression. The Thai Government has paid special 
attention to this problem, and has been trying to get 
cooperation from its neighbors Burma, Laos, and China to wipe 
out production sources. Gelbard said that there is a trend of 
drug addiction becoming a more complicated and more serious 
problem as technology continues to advance. There is also 
growing consumer demand. He thanked the Thai Government for its 
consistent cooperation with the U.S. Government in fighting 
against narcotics.

  [Text] On the morning of 31 January, the Ministry of 
Culture and Information met with the leading representatives of 
various cultural and information offices from Nghe An province 
northward to review past activities and discuss specific ways of 
intensifying didactical propaganda aimed at persuading 
multiethnic mountain compatriots to give up their poppy growing, 
opium trafficking, and opium smoking. 
  To help various localities continue stepping up their drug 
control program, the Ministry of Culture and Information 
recently delivered an additional eight sets of television and 
video cassette players together with video films in the Mandarin 
and H'mong languages to various sensitive areas for the various 
propaganda teams to entertain the people in the mountain regions 
during the Tet new year festival. 
  During the first quarter of this year, a series of 
publications including one on paintings and photographs for 
exhibition purposes, a pamphlet with questions and answers on 
the drug issue, a book of songs and poems, and a pictoral 
pamphlet on drug control will be widely published in mountain 
regions, especially in areas where poppy growing and opium 
smoking have become traditional activities. 
  On this occasion, the participating comrades proposed that 
the government and relevant ministries and sectors make an 
appropriate investment in the information and propaganda task. 
In particular, an economic policy must be mapped out for those 
areas where the compatriots are shifting from poppy growing to 
substitute crops.

<F P=106> [By Soumya K. Ghosh] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 23 -- After a gap of a few years, 
Delhi is again becoming the hub of India's flourishing narcotics 
industry. It is also back on the world map as a major 
originating centre for heroin export. 
  Estimates suggest that of the 40 tonnes of heroin produced 
in 
this country annually, as much as 25 tonnes of this illicitly 
produced commodity passes through the Capital. 
  Anti-drug agencies say that nearly 50 kg of heroin, which is 
55 to 60 per cent pure, enters Delhi every day from the 
neighbouring States of Rajasthan, UP [Uttar Pradesh], and Madhya 
Pradesh. 
  It is clear that their tall claims notwithstanding, 
organisations like the NCB [Narcotics Control Board], DRI 
[Directorate of Revenue Intelligence], Customs and Directorate 
of Enforcement have been quite ineffective in restricting the 
trafficking in drugs. 
  Adding to the problem is a corrupt and inefficient police 
system. Together, these factors have combined to make the scale 
of drug trafficking in Delhi comparable to the other major 
narcotics capitals of the world, such as, New York, Rome, and 
Athens. 
  Delhi first witnessed a narcotics boom in the mid-198Os, 
when 
large quantities of heroin were smuggled into the Capital for 
re-export to the West. The drug was produced in the Golden 
Crescent countries to India's north-west or the Golden Triangle 
countries to the east. 
  But due to stringent enforcement of the draconian Narcotics 
and Psychotropic Substances Act, which prescribed the death 
penalty for drug trafficking in the case of second-time 
offenders, there was a marked decline in smuggling to and from 
Delhi. 
  But now India itself has become a major producer of heroin, 
although the bulk is still exported to Western countries. An 
independent survey conducted recently in Delhi and neighbouring 
States reveals that the major source of heroin production here 
is a by-product of legitimate opium cultivation. 
  The Government allows a certain quantity of opium to be 
grown 
legitimately, mainly for medicinal purposes. Clearly, some of 
this is being misused. 
  Though the bulk is smuggled out by the farmers growing the 
opium, there is evidence suggesting pilferage from Central 
Government godowns [warehouses]. The areas earmarked for 
clandestine growth of poppy include Mandsaur and Ratlam in 
Madhya Pradesh; Chittorgarh, Jhalawar, Bhawani Mandi, and Kota 
is Rajasthan; and Bareilly, Badaun, and Bara Banki in Uttar 
Pradesh. 
  The survey includes interaction with and interviews of 
several small-time traffickers, revenue officers, policemen of 
various States, private highway bus-drivers and operators, 
headmen of JJ [slum areas] clusters of north-east Delhi and a 
large number of addicts who also function as traffickers. 
  However, the most interesting "pattern" of such dope 
trafficking is the fact that the white heroin is of high grade 
of purity. Earlier, i.e., during the mid-80s, the dope used to 
come from across the border for reexport to U.S. or Europe 
through mainly foreign couriers. It was generally found that 
except the heroin coming from Burma and Thailand, the rest 
contained a lot of impurity. It was for this reason that 
international dope markets, mainly western Europe, the Pak 
variety of brown sugar [variety of heroin] was either left 
unsold or fetched a low price. 
  The drugs coming from Rajasthan, UP [Uttar Pradesh], and MP 
[Madhya Pradesh] are indigenously produced. This means that 
after smuggling out the opium from the cultivation points, it is 
converted into heroin in small makeshift laboratories. 
Explaining the system, a senior Revenue official said that the 
process of conversion, though slightly long-drawn and crude, is 
very interesting. 
  Conversions always take place in the night, mainly through 
making of a morphine base from raw opium, and then processing it 
to heroin with the help of some precursor chemicals. After 
smuggling out raw opium, it is generally stored in cool places, 
mainly near wells or sugarcane fields. Precursor chemicals 
required for the process include acetic anhydride and lime and 
potassium permanganate. The make-shift labs where the 
conversion takes place usually have a stove, filtering apparatus 
and charcoal (for purification). 
  However, the sudden rise in the price of heroin and brown 
sugar in the streets of Delhi is due to the Government's 
decision to impose a restriction on the sale and purchase of 
acetic anhydride, which is one of the most basic chemicals 
required in the textile industry. 
  The entire process of conversion takes about four to five 
hours. The manufacturers, who are mainly poor farmers working 
for some cartel, keep shifting the make-shift labs and have 
specific code words as warning signals. It generally needs two 
persons to prepare the chemicals, while a handful stands guard. 
  According to available statistics, Delhi has over 2 lakh 
addicts mainly spread out in north, north-east, and central 
districts. If 0.25 gm of heroin (that is the minimum for a 
moderate addict) is required by an addict, as a `fix' per day, 
the trafficking of dope is over 50 kg daily. In addition, 
another 10 per cent, i.e., 5 kg, goes for re-export, mainly to 
the U.S. and Europe. 
  The costing of heroin depends largely on the purity and 
quantum of delivery. The standard white heroin, available in 
the streets of the Walled City or the JJ slums of northeast 
Delhi, is about 55 to 60 per cent pure. The costing also 
depends on the conversion ratio of opium. High-grade heroin 
ratio involves 1 kg heroin from 10 kg opium. 
  The cost of high-grade heroin in Delhi is around Rs. 
[rupees] 
1 lakh a kg, though there are places in Rajasthan and interior 
Madhya Pradesh where the same grade can be obtained at Rs. 
80,000 per kilo. It is known that the price can vary if the 
delivery quantity is big. For example, the Chittorgarh and Kota 
variety has a high demand not only in Delhi but also abroad. 
  The distribution network of the dope flowing into Delhi is 
unique. The Muslim cartels, operating from within the Walled 
City have a different mode of functioning compared to the east 
UP gangs of north-east Delhi and the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled 
Tribe ganglords spread out in the Nizamuddin-Jalvayu Vihar area. 
  The dope always travels into Delhi by carriers comprising 
invalids, old women, minor children, lepers and poor people. 
They generally travel by bus or train. ISBT [inter state bus 
terminal] and the railway stations are always avoided for 
security reasons. Anything from Rs. 500 to Rs. 5,000 depending 
on the quantity the person is carrying, is the commission. In 
fact, a small advance is made initially. The final payment is 
made after delivery is made in Delhi. It was also been noticed 
that such carriers bring in other types of drugs and 
psychotropic substances. 
  The trafficking pattern is organised in such a way that each 
carrier will never carry more than 500 to 750 gm. Each of the 
traffickers has definite points to "offload the take". In the 
Walled City, such offload points are innocuous tea shanty, pan 
[betel leaf] stalls, dispensaries of "hakims" [physicians] or 
even shops selling "ittar" [perfume], "surma" [cosmetic for 
eyebrow] etc. The movement of the dope from one destination to 
the other is almost instant. 
  The JJ colonies of north-east Delhi, mainly Seemapuri, 
Yamuna 
Pushta, Yamuna Nagar, and Kalyanpuri, are notorious for storing 
dope consignments. Like the Walled City, here also the cartels 
work on a community basis. The gang members are generally 
"poorvis" from eastern Uttar Pradesh and, in several cases, 
women are noticed actively operating in transporting the 
consignment from one safe- house to another. The areas which 
are notorious for storing dope in the Walled City are 
Ballimaran, Chitli Kabar, the Jama Masjid area and Turkman Gate. 
  In addition to the regular supply there are at times 
"specific supplies" to a number of small and cheap hotels in 
Paharganj, Ram Bagh, Daryaganj, and Ara Kasha Road. These 
supplies are mostly to foreigners.

  [Text] Bombay, December 9--Customs officers of the marine 
and preventive wing yesterday arrested three Kenyan women at 
Sahar airport after nine kgs of heroin, worth about Rs 27 crore 
in international markets, was discovered in their baggage. 
  The officials said the drug had been concealed in tins of 
milk powder, coffee, mashed potato, and orange juice in the 
luggage of Victoria Muthen Katnu. The names of her companions 
were given as Hadija Ndope Saidai and Naima Nyakinywa. All three 
were scheduled to fly to Nairobi by an early morning Kenyan 
Airways flight yesterday. 
  Subsequently, the customs officers searched the Bandra 
residence of Dr Kalu Ojiewu, the alleged supplier of the heroin. 
Dr Ojiewu reportedly attempted to escape by leaping off the 
balcony of his first floor flat at plot number 51 on 29th road, 
but was overpowered and held. 
  It is believed that the narcotics were procured by Dr Ojiewu 
from a source in Rajasthan.

  [Text] Hyderabad, December 23--Illegal ganja crop with a 
potential yield of over 12 lakh kg, estimated at Rs 25 crores, 
was destroyed in the districts of Warrangal, Khamman, Karimnagar 
and Vishakapatnam in a three-day joint operation carried out by 
the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the Andhra Pradesh police 
from December 18. 
  The operation also yielded 741 kg of processed ganja, valued 
at over Rs 10 lakhs. 
  The illegal crop, regularly grown in these districts for 
many 
years, was spread over 205.63 acres in 31 villages. 
  A NCB official told TOINS [TIMES OF INDIA NEWS SERVICE] that 
in many areas it was found that the ganja crop had substituted 
cash crops like groundnut and turmeric. In other areas, the crop 
was found interspersed with regular crops. 
  The official added that cultivators who had been growing 
ganja over 1,000 acres about ten years ago had now spread out to 
about 6,000 acres. 
  One acre of crop fetched a price of as much as Rs 2 lakhs, 
thereby attracting more and more cultivators over the years. NCB 
officials found that in many cases local government officials 
were colluding with cultivators. 
  However, no arrests were made during the operations as all 
the cultivators had fled.

  [Text] Zahedan (Sistan-Baluchestan), Feb. 4, IRNA -- A 
number of armed miscreants blocked the Zahedan-Zabol road in 
Tasuki region in this southeastern province last night killing 
four passengers of a passing bus and looting other passengers. 
  According to the local IRNA correspondent the miscreants 
have 
kidnapped three soldiers retuning to Zahedan from leave. 
  The provincial law enforcement official rushing to the scene 
immediately mobilised all resources to track down the 
miscreants, resulting in the arrest of two of bandits along with 
weapons and several rounds of ammunition. 
  The panic-stricken passengers of the bus were being 
questioned on details of the attack. 
  A law enforcement official told IRNA that the miscreants 
were 
agents of a notorious drug trafficking gang leader known as 
'Hamid Nahtani. 
  Nahtani leads an international gang which uses Iran soil as 
a 
transit route to smuggle drugs to Europe. 
  At the moment, said the official, all roads leading to 
Zahedan have been reopened and the security forces are keeping a 
vigilance. A special group was also trying to track down the 
rest of the miscreants, he added. 
  The smugglers had blocked the Khash-Zahedan, Kerman-Zahedan 
and Zabol-Zahedan roads in the past weeks several times looting 
people's properties.

<F P=106> [Article by Saeed Qaisar Rizvi: "Will the New Government Be </F>
Able To Take All-Out Action Against Drug Smugglers?"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The big fish of the drug 
business were suddenly arrested in three MPOs and put in the 
Frontier Province's large jails. Our readers have read about 
them here, and we have been informing them about the activities 
of these enemies of humanity. We have been receiving letters 
from inside and outside the country complaining that we were not 
writing enough against these elements. One of these letters is 
from Mr. Manzoor who has written us from Norway. While 
governments and officials now and then proclaim their strength, 
the fact remains that these elements [drug dealers] have set up 
shadow governments in almost every part of the world, and it is 
quite easy for them to wipe out humanity from the face of the 
earth. Even today, there are individuals including members of 
legislative bodies who are engaged in drug dealing, but the 
government is powerless to bring them to justice. A former 
minister and major drug dealer, Amanullah Kandi, was convicted 
in a Karachi court, but to this day it is not clear how he was 
transferred from Karachi jail to the central jail of Dera Ismail 
Khan, his native town, and who had a hand in helping him escape 
from that prison. Recently, a journalist went to interview him, 
but the journalist's camera and the tape of the interview were 
confiscated by government officials. In spite of strong 
reassurances by the government, Kandi has eluded capture. 
  Meanwhile, Peshawar high court's full bench has thrown out 
the appeal entered against the disqualification of Rahnuma Nadir 
Khan Zaka Kheel running against National Assembly Speaker Gauhar 
Ayub Khan from Haripur precinct NA13, and the disqualification 
of Mehmand Agency's Haji Qadar Gul Mehmand (former MNA) accused 
of drug dealing, and of Khyber Agency's Haji Ibrahim Khan. These 
individuals had been barred from participating in the elections 
by the returning officials and later by the election appellate 
tribunal. Haji Qadar Gul Mehmand and Haji Ibrahim Khan were 
arrested by the local police on charge of selling drugs and 
these two individuals are still in jail. The full bench 
consisted of justice Abdul Karim Kandi; justice Sayed Ibni Ali; 
justice Abdul Rahman Khan; justice Khiar Khan and justice Mian 
Mohammad Ajmal. The candidacy papers filed by petitioner Sayed 
Sultan Shah were rejected because he did not pay the money owed. 
  The [candidacy] papers of Nadir Khan Zakha Kheel who was a 
candidate for the national assembly from Khyber Agency were 
rejected on grounds that he had fought against government 
officials during construction of Qamar road in Tirah and had 
harmed national security; he was barred from running in the 
elections. National Assembly hopeful from Mehmand Agency, Haji 
Qadar Gul Mehmand and Khyber Agency's Haji Ibrahim Khan, who 
were charged with drug dealing, had their papers rejected and 
were barred from participation in the elections. The two men 
were arrested by the local police, and they are still in jail. 
  Following the rejection of their election petitions, these 
two individuals appealed to the election tribunal, but their 
appeal was also rejected. They entered four separate writs in 
the Peshawar high court against the tribunal's decision barring 
them from election participation. On Thursday, the high court's 
full bench rejected their writs. These candidates cannot take 
part in the elections. The attorney general of Pakistan, who 
prosecuted the case for the government, took the position that 
elections did not merely imply voting on a certain date but were 
a gradual process in which it was necessary to file candidacy 
papers, assign election symbols, qualify or disqualified 
candidates to run. The attorney general said that the election 
tribunal had decided as to whether these individuals were 
qualified or not. After elections took place under article 225 
of the constitution, these individuals could challenge their 
disqualification in the next election tribunal. Consequently, it 
was not within the jurisdiction of the court to hear the 
petitions of these individuals. 
  Referring to the 1989 Javid Hashemi case in the Pakistan 
Supreme Court, the attorney general said that the Supreme Court 
had rejected Javed Hashemi's appeal and instructed him to take 
his case to the election tribunal after elections were over. 
Lawyers for petitioners Haji Ibrahim Khan and Nadir Khan Zakha 
Kheel raised the point that at that time Supreme Court Justice 
Naseem Hasan Shah's decision was contrary to the decisions of 
the rest of the justices. At this juncture, the chief justice 
said that the majority of the Supreme Court justices had 
rejected Javed Hashemi's appeal. Justice Nasim Hasan Shah said 
if the majority agreed on a decision, he would go along with it. 
The attorney general pointed out that the Sindh High Court had 
made a similar decision in the Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi case and 
ruled that the high court did not have the jurisdiction to hear 
Jatoi's appeal and that the decision could be challenged in the 
election tribunal to be set up after the elections. Haji Qadar 
Gul's lawyer said that his client's langi had been revoked. 
Langi is an honor awarded to certain prominent individuals in 
the agencies and is usually given to those favored by the 
government.

  [Excerpt] Islamabad (MASHRIQ Panel): Federal Minister of 
the Interior Nasirullah Babar has announced that, after the 
court proceedings relating to the [drug] dealers on the wanted 
list, have been completed in Pakistan, these individuals would 
be handed over to the U.S. In an interview with the MASHRIQ 
panel held in the interior minister's office in Islamabad, the 
minister said that the government was determined to establish 
the supremacy of the law at any cost. He said that the "big 
fish" of the drug dealing business, who were facing legal 
charges in the U. S. or other countries, would first have to 
complete all legal procedures in Pakistani courts, and, if found 
guilty as charged, these individuals would then be handed over 
to face court trials in other countries. He said that Pakistan 
had bilateral agreements with other countries under which 
Pakistan would have to extradite to these countries individuals 
who had committed crimes there. He said that the present 
government had no intention of shirking its international 
responsibilities. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Campaign Against Drug Smugglers"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has taken stern notice 
of the increasing drug abuse in our country and has instructed 
taking some steps against it. At the same time, she told the 
relevant government agencies to become fully active in this 
area. While chairing a high-level meeting of an antinarcotics 
task force in Islamabad on 30 November, she approved plans for a 
strong and effective operation against major smugglers and 
smuggling in this country. On this occasion, Madam Bhutto said 
that the drug smugglers must be arrested at any cost, and the 
government will not accept political pressure of any kind in 
this context so that this curse can be eradicated from our 
country. While addressing this special meeting, the prime 
minister instructed them to deal with the drug smugglers with an 
iron hand. 
  The government cannot tolerate this ugly crime and curse 
under any circumstance because this curse has ruined thousands 
of people and their families. Who does not know that production 
and smuggling of drugs in our country has caused innumerable 
social and moral ills here and many people are losing their 
health and lives. Not only this, members of their family, after 
suffering from economic and social crisis, lead impoverished 
lives. 
  If we briefly survey our recent past, we will learn that the 
drug abuse epidemic that has spread all over our country did not 
even exist 12-14 year ago. There was not even one heroin addict 
in our whole country, and now they number in the hundreds of 
thousands. The number is increasing rapidly. In addition, we are 
getting a bad name abroad, and this is not a secret. Those who 
have travelled abroad well know that every Pakistani is 
considered to be a drug dealer in Western nations although most 
of these nations suffer from this curse themselves. 
  It is our misfortune that many influential persons in our 
country are involved or they are protecting these criminals who 
are involved in this hated drug trade here or abroad. At times, 
this involvement enters into our politics because it is not 
possible to practice politics here without a lot of money, and 
there is no easier way to collect a lot of money than this 
trade. A review of the drug trade shows that it is destroying 
our society here and giving our country a bad name abroad. The 
previous governments had also announced plans of action against 
drug smugglers, and the leaders had expressed their 
determination to use an iron hand to arrest drug smugglers and 
punish them in order to rid the country of this curse. However, 
the spout continued to grow right there. The action of the 
present government to rid society of the curse of drugs and to 
take action against it is commendable. Still, we must study the 
reasons for the failure of previous governments in this area. 
Who are the people who protect these criminals? Why were not the 
operations launched in the past successful? Until these basic 
facts are analyzed, every campaign in this area will be 
unsuccessful.

<F P=106> [Article by Chaudhry M. A. Shaida Advocate: "The Spread of </F>
Drugs Is a Serious Problem."] 
  [Text] According to the national press, the drug mafia is 
buying Stinger missiles from Afghan commanders. An alleged major 
smuggler and drug king is making the Afghan commanders a better 
offer than the Americans for Stinger missiles. The Afghans and 
tribal leaders negotiate over the price of Stinger missiles 
which are stored in an unknown location in a tribal area. 
Reportedly, an armed reaction by tribal sardars cannot be ruled 
out because of the operation carried out against drug smugglers. 
In August 1993 the federal cabinet officially approved an 
administrative and budget package aimed at purging drugs from 
the country by the year 2000. The determination shown by the 
caretaker government in taking action first against those who 
are delinquent in repaying government loans and compulsory 
levies [taxes] or have had these loans forgiven, and second 
against drug smugglers, is a laudable measure and greatly 
welcomed by all patriotic and informed Pakistanis. The smuggling 
and use of drugs have not only ruined Pakistan's reputation 
internationally, but also constitute a heinous plot to poison 
and thus destroy the next generation. Heroin is sold in cities 
as well as in the streets of remote villages, and no correct 
statistics exist as to the number of drug addicts. There are 
wide divergences in the numbers of drug addicts cited 
occasionally by government officials and ministers. 
  As regards the advent of the heroin trade in Pakistan, the 
preparation and smuggling of heroin in Pakistan started after 
the Iranian revolution and the Soviet attack on Afghanistan. On 
the one hand, the Iranian Government imposed the death penalty 
on drug smugglers, and, on the other hand, during the Afghan 
jihad, certain Afghan drug smugglers obtained the cooperation of 
a number of locally influential individuals in the free tribal 
areas of Pakistan and established heroin processing laboratories 
there. Since opium is grown in the free tribal areas and 
northern regions, it was easy to obtain raw materials for the 
heroin laboratories. The trade facilities provided by Pakistan 
to Afghanistan were used for illegal purposes, and chemicals 
needed in heroin production were imported into Pakistan and sent 
to heroin laboratories in free tribal areas. Not only 
influential individuals but certain high government officials in 
agencies responsible for curbing the drug trade were involved in 
this reprehensible business. 
  You may remember that during the term of the late Zia, the 
U.S. gave substantial aid to Pakistan aimed at ending opium 
cultivation in the Gadown Amazai area by offering alternative 
means of livelihood to the opium cultivators. However, there was 
widespread corruption and theft in this aid program. Secret 
agencies reported during Zia's term that a number of National 
Assembly deputies were involved in the preparation and smuggling 
of heroin, but no steps were taken against these individuals. 
The long reach of these individuals involved in drug smuggling 
can be gauged from the fact that a former minister of the 
Northwest Frontier Province, who was jailed for heroin 
smuggling, escaped from prison. 
  An important reason for the production and smuggling of 
heroin is the high price it commands on the international 
market. We will have to accept the fact that certain influential 
Pakistanis have amassed huge fortunes by promoting the drug 
business, and their wealth has given rise to innumerable moral 
and social evils in our society. The part played by the drug 
mafia money in politics is no secret; mafia activity has changed 
the very nature of the society. The tragic situation now is that 
ladies from well-to-do families, students, and even female 
students in colleges and universities have fallen victim to this 
destructive, expensive, and lethal addiction. 
  It would be inexcusable if we did not praise here the 
efforts 
of the caretaker government to end drug abuse. All Pakistanis 
accept the fact that the caretaker government made some 
courageous decisions which a democratic or political government, 
which has many kinds of pressure on it, may not have been able 
to do. As for the drug mafia and the heroin business, thanks to 
the lack of interest, incompetence, and aloofness displayed by 
certain past governments, the drug mafia has become so 
influential and powerful in Pakistan that it has been able to 
establish close connections with the entire bureaucracy. The 
drug mafia is so influential in the political arena that several 
assembly members and ministers are accused of complicity in this 
reprehensible business. For the first time, the caretaker 
government has taken concrete and effective measures to end this 
running sore in society, and, for this effort, the caretaker 
government deserves the gratitude and prayers of the entire 
nation. Many members of the drug mafia have forsaken politics 
and elections and some have fled in fear to Afghanistan. 
Pakistan Narcotics Board has become active throughout the 
country against heroin dealers and the drug mafia.

<F P=106> [Article by Tehsimul Haq Haqi: "Need for Effective Steps To </F>
Control Drugs"] 
  [Text] A lot has been written about the abuse and ill 
effects of drugs. However, no effective steps have been taken to 
stop this curse. This has resulted in escalated abuse by the 
younger generation. According to a report issued by the director 
of intelligence, about 1.2 million people are addicted to this 
ugly habit. From among 45,000 prisoners, 12,000 were arrested 
for crimes related to the drug trade. In some areas of Punjab as 
many as 40 percent of the population is involved in the drug 
trade. According to the findings of a U.S. drug expert, drug 
traders are earning $1.22 billion from the heroin trade alone. 
The question arises: can we afford to spend that much money? The 
administration should consider how much money they spend to 
control the drug trade. The little work being done to control 
drug abuse in Pakistan is insufficient. Even now 200,000 new 
persons fall prey to drug abuse each year. If people continued 
to become drug addicts at this rate, the time is not far off 
when 15 percent of Pakistan's population will be suffering from 
this addiction. The former caretaker prime minister, Mayueen 
Qureshi, had a list of drugs smugglers which included over 160 
very influential persons from our country. Because of political 
considerations this list was neither made public nor were these 
smugglers arrested. Now after the removal of the caretaker 
government, this whole affair seems to have been totally 
ignored. It is not expected that a political government will 
touch influential persons. The second problem is that, because 
of the specific kind of government and life style in our tribal 
areas, the drug dealers move there to avoid arrest. Others get 
support from political leaders and move to Afghanistan, which is 
famous for producing and smuggling drugs all over the world. 
  According to a report issued by an international narcotics 
control agency, Afghanistan is second after Burma for exporting 
opium. The figures included in this report show that poppy 
cultivation increased by 12 percent in Afghanistan last year 
(1992), and 14,790 hectares was used for cultivating poppy. This 
will harvest 640 metric tons of opium. In Langaryar and Halmand 
provinces of Afghanistan, 75 percent of the land is used for 
growing opium. If the Afghan people want, they could take 
concrete steps to stop drug abuse. Drug abuse is extremely 
dangerous for people, and they cannot adjust themselves to their 
environments. This reduces their judgment ability. The curse of 
drug abuse cannot be controlled by rhetoric and statements given 
to the press. This curse can be ended only when concrete steps 
are taken. Not only this, strict action is necessary against 
those who are involved in this trade. Our younger generation can 
play an important role in this context if they unite and resolve 
to stop the rising tide of drug abuse and its negative effects. 
If they do that, there is no reason that we cannot rid society 
of the evils of drug dealers and drug abuse.

  [Text] According to a report published in a Lahore 
Urdu-language newspaper, General Termazi, the leader of the 
special task force appointed by the government, has sent the 
prime minister a list of 160 international drug smugglers. The 
majority are individuals who play central roles in Pakistani 
politics. According to sources, the prime minister has 
instructed General Termazi to place these "big fish" under 
immediate arrest and bring them to trial in the high courts. 
Reportedly General Termazi has met with high officials and 
informed them of the situation. Meanwhile, as a result of the 
activities of the Special Task Force, the owners of heroin 
factories on the Toor Kham Kabul border are selling their heroin 
at cheap prices. Most well-known heroin dealers have moved their 
factories and themselves to Afghanistan in order to stay beyond 
the reach of the Task Force. According to informed sources, Ayub 
Afridi, the drug king, is sending all his furniture to 
Switzerland, and has gone into hiding. Ayub Afridi is wanted by 
Interpol in several drug smuggling cases. Several other drug 
dealers, some of whom are women who observe purdah [veil], have 
ordered their agents to cease operations and to go underground 
temporarily. It has also been learned that, in its initial 
activity, the Task Force arrested a number of agents working for 
drug sellers, and is interrogating them in secret locations.

  [Text] The director general of the Narcotics Control Board 
said in a speech that all efforts to control the drug trade in 
Pakistan have been unsuccessful because some elected officials, 
high-level government administrators, members of assemblies, 
industrialists, and even some members of the Narcotics Control 
Board itself are involved in this trade. He named one assembly 
member, who was sentenced in London, but is still a member of 
the assembly. He also mentioned apprehending drugs valued at 20 
million rupees belonging to a very important person in Karachi. 
  If the Narcotics Board first removes its own corrupt 
employees, it could be successful in its mission of catching the 
`big fish' with government cooperation. What is necessary is to 
form a solid plan and then ask for cooperation from all those 
countries that have made remarkable progress in controlling this 
evil.

<F P=106> [News Report: "Number of Heroin Addicts in Pakistan Now 1.5 </F>
Million"] 
  [Text] Karachi, 22 December (Staff Report)--The number of 
heroin addicts in Pakistan now exceeds 1.5 million. These heroin 
addicts spend 43.8 billion rupees to support their habit. This 
information was revealed by a voluntary organization and based 
on findings in its latest survey. According to this survey, 
people got heroin free in 1979. In 1981 a small packet of heroin 
cost 10 rupees. Now this same packet costs 30 rupees. 
Interestingly enough, the increase in price was accompanied by 
adulteration in heroin. This is indicated by the fact that in 
1979 one could make seven to eight cigarettes from one packet of 
heroin. Now they cannot make even one loose cigarette from that. 
A heroin addict has to spent 80 to 200 rupees daily to support 
his habit. Another interesting fact learned from this survey is 
that the majority of heroin addicts are educated people. Only 17 
percent of these addicts are illiterate. These addicts include 
even those with masters degrees. The majority of these heroin 
addicts are between the ages of 21 and 30, and 25 percent of 
these addicts have been using heroin for more than 10 years. 
Seventy-five percent of these addicts go back to the habit 
because of bad company even after treatment.

  [Text] Peshawar (MASHRIQ News): The political 
administration of Karam Agency has seized 1,399 kilograms of 
heroin worth millions of rupees, as well as the pickup truck 
used to smuggle the narcotics. According to details received, 
the Agency's political agent was informed that certain 
international smugglers would smuggle a large quantity of heroin

countries. A raiding party was formed under the supervision of 
assistant political agent, Abdullah Khan. In the Khoidad Kheel 
police station area, the raiding party signalled a pickup truck,

the truck started firing on the levy force. When the levy force 
fired back, the smugglers left the truck and ran away. A search 
of the truck produced 1,399 kilograms of heroin. The political 
administration has seized the pickup and its cargo and started

<F P=106> [News Report: "Attempt To Smuggle 63 Kilograms of Heroin </F>
Foiled"] 
  [Text] Rawalpindi, 17 December (PPA)--The antinarcotics 
task force has foiled a smuggling attempt and has recovered a 
huge quantity of heroin valued at millions of rupees in the 
foreign market. According to a press release issued by the task 
force, this heroin was being smuggled from the tribal areas of 
Sarhad. The task force personnel recovered 63 kilograms of high 
grade heroin hidden in a jeep with fake license plates. This 
raid was led by Brigadier Ali Akbar, regional head in Peshawar. 
It should be remembered that the real owner of the jeep, who was 
riding in another car 30 kilometers away, was also arrested on 
identification by the driver. Investigations are going on and a 
"big fish" is believed to be behind this crime. They expect to 
unmask and arrest that person.

  [Text] Lagos, 2 Feb (AFP) -- Eight bags of heroin with an 
estimated value of 12.45 million dollars have been stolen from 
the offices of Nigeria's National Drug Law Enforcement Agency 
[NDLEA], a source close to the justice minister said Wednesday. 
Confirming press reports of the theft, the official, who asked 
not to be named, said Justice Minister Olu Onagoruwa was "very 
angry with the development and has promised to investigate it 
because of the serious implications it has for the image of the 
country abroad." 
  The heroin was part of a load of 248.3 kg (546 pounds) of 
high-grade heroin, valued at 976.5 million dollars, seized by 
narcotics agents in December in what was thought to be Africa's 
largest ever drugs haul. 
  Suspected drugs baron, Joe Brown Akubueze, is currently 
standing trial in a special court on charges of importing the 
heroin which he allegedly bought from Thailand. The heroin was 
neatly wrapped in 649 bags and concealed in water coolers. 
  Officials from the special court visited the NDLEA premises 
Tuesday, to find that eight of the packets were already missing. 
The NDLEA was established in 1990 to fight drug trafficking in 
all its ramifications.

  [Text] Lagos, 2 Feb (NAN/PANA) -- Only 641 of the 649 
heroin wraps which had been seized by the Nigerian National Drug 
Law Agency (NDLEA) last December have been accounted for in a 
court in Lagos. The seized heroin, allegedly imported by one Joe 
Brown Ekubueze, were seized by the anti-narcotics agency at 
Apapa Port and had been stored at warehouses in Buxton and Shaw 
Roads, Ikoyi in Lagos. 
  The discrepancy was raised Tuesday by an unidentified state 
witness, who claimed to be a narcotic superintendent with NDLEA. 
He said the discrepancy was only discovered when the drugs 
actually seized were counted by a team from the miscellaneous 
offences tribunal, which has started hearing the case. He 
claimed that there was overestimation of the wraps which were 
seized last December. He said the total wraps of heroin, 
excluding one wrap presented as exhibit in the court, was 289. 
  Retracting from his earlier testimony, the agent said the 
total number of seized heroin wraps was 290 and not 302 [as] 
were found by the tribunal's inspection team. He added that 
another 87 pouches of heroin were seized 30 December, each 
containing two wraps, plus the one tendered as [an] exhibit in 
the tribunal. This brought the number of wraps to 351 and not 
347, said the witness, who was only referred to as "Mr W". 
Asked by Justice Olufunmilayo One-Okpaku to explain the 
discrepancy, the agent said "I am not competent to explain the 
discrepancy in the number of wraps counted because I am not the 
exhibit keeper."

  [Text] Lagos, 31 Jan. (NAN) -- The flag officer commanding 
Western Naval Command (WNC), Rear Admiral Jibril Ayinla, has 
directed the immediate withdrawal of all naval personnel 
attached to private jetties in the areas of operation of the 
command, the NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) reports. Disclosing 
this in an interview with NAN today in Lagos, Rear Admiral 
Ayinla, said that the decision was necessitated by the need to 
re-appraise naval strategy of policing private jetties in the 
Western and Delta coastal areas to enhance effectiveness. 
  The flag officer commanding [FOC] said that the current 
practice of stationing naval personnel to police and verify 
cargoes at private jetties would be replaced with naval task 
forces, to effectively combat the menace of smugglers, illegal 
bunkerers [as received] and ferrying of hard drugs. The task 
forces, he said, would be set up at different locations in the 
areas of operations of naval units where such jetties were 
located. Members of the task forces each of which would be 
under the command of an officer, Rear Admiral Ayinla said, would 
undertake regular patrol and conduct raids and inspection of 
vessels at the private jetties. 
  The FOC said that the current move, was part of naval 
efforts 
to sustain and intensify battles against misuse of private 
jetties for economic sabotage and anti-social purposes, 
particularly as the federal government was striving to revive 
the nation's economy. He said that the Navy, had earlier 
observed that some of its personnel posted to man some private 
jetties were being corrupted, hence, the need to change 
strategy. On the state of the operational readiness of the 
ships in the arsenal of the Western Command, Rear Admiral Ayinla 
said that though most of the ships were behind in their 
maintenance programme, the command was going to "improvise, 
innovate and use initiative to make the best of a very bad 
situation." He said that ideally, naval ships should be taken 
out of water every nine months for maintenance, but pointed out 
that this had not been possible due to non-availability of funds. 
  Rear Admiral Ayinla advocated increased funding of the Navy, 
to enable the force [to] effectively discharge its duties of 
protecting the nation's coastal resources, particularly oil.

  [Text] Strasbourg, Prague Feb 4 (CTK) -- Drug-related 
crime in the Czech Republic might soon reach "European 
proportions," in spite of international cooperation in the 
struggle against it, Czech Interior Minister Jan Ruml told the 
2nd international conference on struggle against drug abuse 
today. 
  "I admit that I am really afraid of the future. This stems 
from the fact that a great number of UN conventions have been in 
force for thirty years, but the drug-related crime has not 
decreased, rather the contrary. I am concerned by the statement 
of director-general of the Interpol that the struggle against 
illegal drug trafficking has failed and legalisation of drugs is 
a possible solution for the future," Ruml noted. 
  He described his election as deputy chairman of the 
conference as an expression of the Czech Republic's effort to 
contribute to the struggle against the drug danger, Ruml said. 
  The conference was staged by the expert organisation for 
cooperation of the struggle against drug abuse and drug 
trafficking within the European Council which is known as the 
Pompidou Group.

<F P=106> [Report by Katy Turner] </F>
  [Text] Dutch Judges have been in Cyprus investigating 
allegations of drug smuggling involving offshore companies from 
Holland, it was revealed yesterday. 
  Police spokesman Savas Andoniadhis said the judges, who were 
assisted by the Cyprus force, were conducting a general inquiry 
into smuggling. 
  Narcotics and fabrics are understood to have been included 
in 
the investigations. The judges were on the island for ten days. 
  The value of the smuggled goods is believed to be thousands 
of dollars. 
  A seven-member team comprising the judges, lawyers, and tax 
inspectors investigated two unnamed Dutch offshore companies. 
  The companies are believed to have moved huge quantities of 
fabric to Lebanon and Pakistan using documents relating to 
another country. 
  According to reports, members of one offshore company were 
described as owners of boat which was bought with drugs money. 
  A Dutch judge issued a confiscation order on the unnamed 
boat 
and any property gained through smuggling.

  [Text] Rostock -- According to the Regional Finance Office

German drug trafficking center for cocaine. Since July 1992, a 
total of 240 kg of cocaine has been impounded in six operations, 
a spokesman of the authority announced today when presenting the 
annual 1993 customs report for Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. 
Thus, the situation in Rostock is worse than in Hamburg, 
Bremen, and even Antwerp. The drugs have a street value of 
approximately 80 million German marks. In the most recent 
operation this year, in November, police seized 12 kg of cocaine 
aboard the freighter Bille Trop from Columbia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Police Seize 100k of Heroin"] </F>
  [Text] Milan, 3 Feb (ANSA) -- Milan police today seized one 
quintal [100 kg] of pure heroin with a street value of close to 
five million dollars and arrested a suspected 'Ndrangheta 
organized crime figure to conclude an operation which began over 
the year-end holiday period when the automobile owned by the 
alleged courier was secretly fitted with an electronic tracking 
device. 
  Police here, who worked with the Criminalpol branch and the 
special narcotics squad, said Vincenzo Mobilio, 38, was stopped 
today at a toll booth east of Milan leading off the Venice-Milan 
expressway where they found 100k [kg] of uncut heroin in the 
boot of his car. He had been under close surveillance since 
Tuesday afternoon [1 February] when he left Milan for Venice. 
  The suspect is from a town in the southern Calabria region 
and now lives in Milan with his wife and three children. He is 
thought by investigators to be on the payroll of the 
Calabria-based 'Ndrangheta. 
  A police spokesman said the heroin had been "professionally 
packaged" in one-kilogram insulated bags "with a technique of 
great precision, something new for us." The goods could have 
been cut seven times, seven kilograms for retailing for each 
kilogram of the Turkish-produced drug. 
  Milan Police Chief Achille Serra reported that the haul was 
the biggest since November 1985 when a shipment of 114k [kg] was 
seized here. He also explained that the wholesale price of this 
type of heroin has doubled over the past year, to nearly 50,000 
dollars per kilogram, because traffickers have been experiencing 
increasing difficulty in laying hands on the Turkish goods.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans Buddingh' and Marcel Haenen: "Justice </F>
Department Unaware of DEA Infiltration"] 
  [Excerpt] During the 1980's, agents from the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) organized, from the U.S. 
Embassy in The Hague, the transport of chemicals to the 
Netherlands Antilles, Suriname, and Colombia for use in the 
manufacture of cocaine. 
  The DEA used barrels equipped with a transmitter in order to 
locate the laboratories for which the chemicals were destined. 
These activities, in 1985 and 1986, took place in the greatest 
secrecy and without the knowledge of the Netherlands Justice 
Department. The CRI [Central Information Research Agency] had 
made it known to the Americans during the preparatory stages 
that such infiltration methods were to be rejected. 
  For the deliveries, the Americans used the Netherlands 
criminal informer Dick Stotijn, who was in contact with drug 
cartels in South America. He was appointed director of a 
company, Berg Trading Services, which was based in the Belgian 
town of Putte, just over the border from the Netherlands. In 
the Netherlands Antilles Stotijn found drug dealers ready to 
take chemicals purchased from the French company Blondeau. With 
the knowledge of the French company, direction finders were 
included with the ether and acetone in the barrels. 
  According to DEA agent D. Laverty, who worked in The Hague 
in 
the 1980's, two major operations were conducted in any event via 
the export from Belgium in 1986. One shipment located a 
laboratory in Colombia which was finally put out of operation. 
The former head of the CRI narcotics bureau, G. de Gooyer, said 
that his department was not "actively involved" in the 
controlled dispatch of chemicals. He said he could not remember 
whether his American colleagues had told him what they were 
doing. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Strasbourg, Feb 4 (A.A) -- Interior Minister Nahit 
Mentese presented a file of the outlawed separatist terrorist 
PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization which included the 
organization's relations with drug traffic, it was reported on 
Friday. 
  Mentese who is currently attending a Council of Europe 
ministerial meeting on drugs said the file showed that PKK had 
links with 53 drug traffic incidents which happened between 
1990-1993 adding that nearly four tonnes of heroin were seized 
during this time. 
  Mentese said European security officials also confirmed the 
organization's activities on drug traffic. 
  The file gives the names of the terrorists from the outlawed 
separatist PKK organization who were earlier caught together 
with large quantities of narcotics in several countries of the 
world and in Turkey. 
  Meanwhile, a document published at the end of the meeting, 
with Turkey's initiatives, said "European countries strengthen 
their commitment that they will work together against terror 
organizations who have links with drug traffic."

Price of Cocaine Drops"] 
  [Text] The street price of cocaine has dropped steeply over 
the past year, indicating that it is more widely available, 
according to a survey published this morning. The report also 
highlights a big increase in home-grown cannabis. 
  The survey, produced by Release, the drugs and legal advice 
service, suggests there has been a steady resurgence in the 
popularity of LSD, thought to be partly due to a switch from 
Ecstasy because of uncertainty about its quality. 
  The price of cocaine, once as high as &pound;100 a gramme, 
now 
averages &pound;40 to &pound;60 a gramme, although there are 
regional 
variations and the price can go as low as &pound;30. The drug is 
being used most widely in London and the South-east. 
  Cannabis remains the most popular drug throughout Britain, 
with prices at &pound;25 to &pound;30 a quarter ounce for herbal 
cannabis and resin. The price has been stable for about 10 
years. However, the market for homegrown "grass" appears to be 
developing, a trend led by the Dutch, the survey said. Indoor 
growers operate under sophisticated botanical conditions 
involving high wattage halogen lightbulbs and complex water 
feeding systems. Dutch "skunk weed" can cost as much as 
&pound;60 a 
quarter ounce, while some British home grown strains sell for as 
little as &pound;15. 
  The anaesthetic drug, ketamin--associated with the dance 
scene--has become more available, selling at around &pound;15 a 
tablet. 
  Crack cocaine is most widely available in London and 
inner-city areas of the Midlands and North-west, but is rarely 
found in Scotland or rural areas. It is sold by the "rock" at 
between &pound;15 and &pound;25. 
  Mike Goodman, director of Release, said "millions" would be 
taking drugs for recreational purposes over the festive season. 
While abstinence was safest, people should be aware that it 
could be dangerous to mix some drugs and alcohol. He urged those 
taking drugs not to drive.

Cocaine Seizure: Mafia Muscles in on Britain's Drug Smuggling 
Trade"] 
  [Text] The Mafia has for the first time been directly 
linked to drug-smuggling into this country after the seizure of 
250kg of cocaine at Felixstowe, Suffolk, last week. 
  A Mafia presence had already been established in Britain, 
used as a base to launder profits from crime or as a transfer 
point for drugs being smuggled to other countries. The seizure 
will call into question the view that the Mafia would probably 
be attracted to softer targets in eastern Europe, rather than 
London, as a destination for drugs. 
  In Italy earlier this month, Paul Condon, the Metropolitan 
police commissioner, met the judge supervising the drive against 
the Mafia. Although he is understood to have been advised that 
the Italian authorities believe the Mafia was working to expand 
into Russia and Hungary rather than the UK, he was warned that 
it was using London to launder money. 
  Two years ago British embassy staff in Rome issued a warning 
that this country could become a target for the Mafia. The 
authors of the report, a senior diplomat and a Scotland Yard 
officer on secondment with the Italian police, were accused of 
exaggerating the risks. Now, with the first evidence that the 
Mafia could be targeting Britain with big drugs consignments, 
that view might have to be revised. 
  Police and Customs officers have long accepted that the 
Mafia 
has a presence in Britain but its size and influence has been 
unclear. Intelligence had also suggested this country was being 
used principally to launder profits or as a transfer point for 
drugs on their way to other countries. There were few overt 
signs of the Mafia although the death of an Italian cocaine 
dealer in west London over a decade ago raised the possibility 
of a Mafia-style killing. Investigators in another case also 
uncovered an agricultural fraud stretching from Sicily to 
Britain. 
  The first evidence that the presence might be more potent 
came in the 1980s when Customs officers broke up a heroin 
smuggling ring linked to Montreal. 
  Francesco Di Carlo, who had been living under cover in 
Surrey, was jailed for 25 years in 1987 as the head of a racket 
moving heroin worth &pound;75 million. 
  Di Carlo, who had lived undisturbed in Woking after being 
exiled from Sicily after being demoted from the island's Mafia 
leadership, had been able to build up a series of businesses and 
other smuggling interests in Britain, apart from the heroin 
trade. The investigators discovered that an even more powerful 
figure had been living in luxury in a country mansion and had 
fled before he could be arrested. 
  Police believe Di Carlo's mantle passed to another chieftain 
who remains in London. A second Mafia figure operates as a 
successful businessman and also still works in Britain. 
  The thrust of Mafia operations had hitherto been identified 
as harnessing London's huge financial markets to move or conceal 
Mafia cash. Scotland Yard recently detected what it believes are 
attempts by the Mafia to buy works of art as long-term 
investments for dirty money. 
  Earlier this year, a colonel from the anti-Mafia squad in 
Rome visited London to examine files on suspected Mafia fraud 
and laundering operations. He was sufficiently concerned by his 
findings to recommend the appointment of an Italian officer to 
work full-time with the unit in London. 
  The cocaine cache now raises new dangers. Since the 
beginning 
of the 1990s, American and European experts on the Mafia have 
been concerned that the Sicilian network of gangs which makes up 
the modern Mafia could be seeking to expand. 
  Italian investigators said that the Mafia would capitalise 
on 
the reduction of frontier controls and trade restrictions within 
the European Union. In the United States, federal agents issued 
warnings about alliances between the Mafia and the Colombian 
cartels.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Krasnoshchekov] </F>
  [Text] Strasbourg February 5 TASS--The development of 
integration processes in Europe and the active drawing into them 
of East European countries are urgently calling for the pooling 
of efforts of all countries of the continent in the struggle 
against international crime and especially drug trafficking, 
which is a serious social evil, Russian Interior Minister Viktor 
Yerin told ITAR-TASS on Friday. He summed up in the interview 
the results of the second all-European conference on the 
ministerial level on cooperation in the struggle against drug 
addiction, which came to a close here. The conference was 
attended by representatives of 32 member states of the Council 
of Europe, as well as those which have the status of specially 
invited at that organisation. "We regard the invitation of 
Russia to this forum as one more step on the way towards 
Russia's integration in the united Europe and the joining of the 
Council of Europe. This is why we are attaching special 
importance to it," Yerin stressed. 
  "In my opinion, the conference provided a good basis for the 
development of cooperation in the struggle against drug 
addiction as a social phenomenon and against drug trafficking, 
which is closer to the tasks facing law-enforcement agencies," 
he continued. According to his estimate, the Strasbourg 
conference was unanimous in the general political, social and 
professional assessment of that phenomenon. It outlined the 
main directions of work, which open up broad prospects for the 
development of cooperation both on the European level and within 
the framework of bilateral contacts, specifically, in the 
expansion of preventive work and joint actions in the spheres, 
which are within the competence of law-enforcement agencies. 
  "Such conferences are not only of major political 
importance, 
but also of much practical interest, because they make it 
possible for every country to advance, using the experience of 
other countries. We shall use international experience as much 
as we can, specifically, when coming up with legislative 
initiatives and submitting them to parliament through the 
government and the president," Yerin said.

  [Text] According to State Customs Committee data, among 
the Russian customs offices the Bryansk Customs occupies one of 
the top places in terms of the quantity of drugs detained. It 
has attained this position in a record short time: Just two 
months ago poppy straw was discovered for the first time on one 
of the trains crossing the republic's border. It was as though 
a dam had burst. By the end of the year staffers of the customs 
office's passenger department had confiscated 574 kg of poppy 
straw.

  [Text] RIGA, Feb 03, BNS - The Latvian capital, Riga, will 
host the office of the Baltic regional bureau for the control of 
narcotic drugs, U.N. expert Dagmar Thomas Halasek told reporters. 
  The bureau's activities will also embrace Lithuania and 
Estonia, Halasek said. The main office will be situated in Riga 
because of the city's advantageous geographical position and the 
successful operation of the Latvian National Drugs Control 
Commission. 
  The bureau will coordinate the efforts of police, customs 
and 
frontier guards to curb the spread of narcotic drugs. 
  Latvia reported 219 criminal cases connected with drugs' 
abuse in 1993, said Vilnis Kipens, a spokesman for the Riga 
Criminal Police Department. In 1993, 47 people died from 
overuse of drugs, the figure increased by 27 death cases 
compared with 1992. 
  Drugs are trafficked to Latvia mainly from Lithuania and the 
Kaliningrad district of Russia, Kipens said.

1961 U.N. convention on narcotic substances and the 1971 U.N. 
convention on psychotropic substances. 
  Although no specfic information is available, experts 
suppose 
that the Baltic states have become a new transit point for drugs 
smuggled to the West. 
  Ona Grimalauskiene, consultant at the Lithuanian Ministry of 
Health Care, said the step will make the struggle against drug 
abuse and drug transit through Lithuanian territory more 
efficient. The above conventions not only oblige Lithuania to 
observe international drug control standards, but also offer 
technical assistance to Lithuanian customs, police and doctors, 
she said. Lithuania can expect help in this field from both 
international organizations and European countries. 
  The Lithuanian Government intends to create a National Drug 
Control Committee that will coordinate the country's drug 
control policy. Drug abuse prophylaxis will be one of the 
committee's principal fields of activity. 
  According to a Jan. 27 government resolution, antidrug laws 
will be drafted in accordance with the two conventions by next 
fall.

The personal property of the convicts was confiscated. 
  It should be noted the operational investigation was

Paris: "The `Golden Crescent' Outstrips the `Golden Triangle' in 
Opium Production; Triangle Sides Are Afghanistan, Pakistan, and 
Iran"] 
  [Text] Where do the extremist Islamists get the money to 
cover the cost of their operations, to fund their networks 
throughout the world, and to buy their weapons? How can leading 
figures like Ayman al-Zawahiri live in Geneva, one of the 
world's most expensive cites, Rabeh Kabir in Bonn, Rachid 
Ghannouchi in London, and Anwar Haddam in Chicago--without known 
sources of income? 
  The Iranian role in funding the many fundamentalist 
movements 
no longer requires evidence: it is officially acknowledged. The 
latest information, however, indicates that Tehran, which is 
going through a severe economic crisis, has initiated a policy 
of austerity towards the support of these movements, forcing 
them to seek out financial sources besides Iranian support. 
  What are these sources? Who are the extremists' new backers? 
A few weeks ago, Western and Arab security reports spoke of 
alternative funding networks used by the fundamentalists. In 
this investigation, AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI exposes the secrets and 
details of these globally organized and coordinated networks. 
The most dangerous of these is an international fundamentalist 
network that trafficks in drugs and smuggles them, in 
cooperation with global mafias; the role of the Golden Crescent 
(Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran); of Golboddin Hekmatyar and 
American intelligence; and the evidence of a new and dangerous 
leadership for fundamentalist extremism based in Afghanistan. 
  Two months after the raid carried out by the French 
authorities against the Algerian fundamentalist network and one 
month after a similar operation on a smaller scale against the 
Tunisian fundamentalist network, French investigators uncovered 
first-hand information about the facts of the North African 
fundamentalist networks and their connections and branches. 
While Paris ended up releasing all the detainees, it confirmed 
the presence of an infrastructure for turning France into a 
terrorist base behind the lines. However, the most important 
thing the investigations have uncovered so far, and to which 
they still accord the greatest importance in following up its 
European and global tentacles, relates to the North African 
fundamentalist movements' funding networks. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI 
has learned that French security agencies discovered, during 
their raids on some of the Algerian and Tunisian Islamists' 
homes and headquarters, huge sums of money, in the millions of 
dollars, and a complex, secret, and organized movement for 
transferring funds and financing. The French were surprised by 
the fact that the money they discovered in secret hiding places 
in the homes of some of the fundamentalists was mostly in 
dollars and other foreign currencies such as Belgian francs, 
German marks, Swiss francs, and pounds sterling, in addition to 
checks drawn on international banks. In the house of an official 
of the Algerian Brotherhood group (the legal face of FIS 
[Islamic Salvation Front]), they discovered $50,000; in the home 
of one of those responsible for funding and logistics, in the 
northern city of Lille, they discovered $300,000, and $30,000 at 
the home of another finance official, who had been able to flee, 
and $54,000 at the home of one of Rabeh Kabir's confidantes. 
  The largest amount was discovered in the house of an 
official 
of the Tunisian Ennahdah movement, one Salah Karkar, who has 
been placed under house arrest. That amount was 2.7 million 
francs in checks. Besides this, the investigations into the 
secret documents discovered in the suspects' homes led to the 
discovery of statements from bank accounts opened in more than 
twenty banks in France, Switzerland, and Belgium, in addition to 
800 addresses worldwide. French authorities are still trying to 
identify some of these banks and the accounts opened with 
numbers referred to in code in the files, but so far it appears 
that Paris discovered a huge fundamentalist funding network with 
numerous branches and activities. It consisted of an 
international funding network passing through the United States, 
Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, the Comoros Islands, and 
Iran, and a very active logistical and coordinating apparatus. 
Perhaps the biggest surprise for the French authorities was that 
this was the first time they were able to expose some of the 
leaders of the North African fundamentalists' funding networks. 
The French have never discovered such large amounts of money, 
even during the investigation of the terrorist operations of 
1986. At that time, the police discovered only 140,000 francs 
(about $28,000) with the first Tunisian suspect, Fouad Ali Saleh 
and his group; then, it was known that the source of the money 
was Iran. 
  Pending the completion of the global investigation, the 
study 
of the other documents, and the monitoring of the funding 
network's tentacles, a basic question must be posed: who is 
behind the funding of the fundamentalists, and where and how did 
they gain access to this volume of money? 
<H5>  Sources of Funding </H5>
  The fact is that the French are not the only ones asking 
this 
question. American intelligence is asking it insistently, and 
has been trying to solve the puzzle since the World Trade Center 
bombing in New York. Numerous Western and Arab security agencies 
have been wondering for some time about the Islamic movements' 
actual source of funding, which plays a crucial role in 
nourishing, developing, and spreading them, and escalating their 
activities, both inside the Arab countries and abroad. In the 
last few weeks, Western security circles have received 
information about the delivery to the armed movements in Algeria 
of huge financial and military assistance that played a role in 
these groups' move to make the situation more tense and make it 
explode on a wider scale. Before that, security officials in 
some European and Western countries that have experienced 
increases in fundamentalist activities, and to which a number of 
fundamentalist leaders have fled, tried to answer similar 
questions. 
  How are the armed fundamentalist movements able to fund 
their 
military operations? How can Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of the 
Egyptian al-Jihad, live in Geneva, one of the world's most 
expensive cities? Where does he secure the funds to cover his 
minimum expenses, which include, at the least, residence in two 
or more apartments and the employment of a number of guards? 
Likewise, how can Rabeh Kebir, the chairman of the executive 
committee of the Algerian FIS abroad, afford the cost of living 
in Germany with a large group of fundamentalists? And where does 
Rachid Ghannouchi, leader of the Tunisian Ennahdah Movement, get 
his income from, while he lives in London without a known 
livelihood, working actively to lead the international Islamic 
movement with Shaykh Hasan al-Turabi? The same questions might 
be asked about FIS member Anwar Haddam, who lives in Chicago, as 
well as other fundamentalist figures scattered through the 
countries of the world. It might also be asked about their means 
of getting the funds to attract and recruit numbers of Muslim 
immigrants. 
  French investigation sources supplied part of the answer 
when 
they uncovered private sources on which the fundamentalists rely 
for funding, with which they meet their needs and purchase 
weapons. These sources represent the fundamentalist funding 
strategy in use in most countries of the world. There is the 
Islamic tax imposed on immigrant families and Arab and Muslim 
shopowners, and contributions are collected in mosques and 
outside them by charitable societies and social, cultural, and 
athletic clubs. Plus, there are Islamic bookstores, travel 
agencies, and import-export companies; there is smuggling, or 
trafficking in smuggled, stolen, or counterfeit merchandise 
(such as Lacoste shirts), the smuggling of automobiles and spare 
parts, which are sold in France, for example, or smuggled into 
Algeria for sale on the black market, in what is called 
"trabando." 
  There is, in addition, the foreign funding and assistance 
some of the fundamentalist movements receive from businessmen, 
wealthy Islamists, countries and regimes, both in cash amounts 
via trusted intermediaries, or through secret channels and 
transfers to numbered bank accounts. 
  Of course, Iran ranks first in funding the fundamentalist 
movements, something that no longer requires evidence, and which 
Tehran has never denied, especially as it has maintained its 
policy of "exporting the revolution" and set up organizations to 
support these movements, such as Bonyad-e Mostazafin, 15 
Khordad, and others, in addition to the budget for the 
Revolutionary Guards and foreign intelligence, which amounts to 
hundreds of millions of dollars. 
  But the surprising thing is that a number of Western and 
Arab 
security agencies began some months ago to start secret 
investigations of the existence of other funding channels for 
the extremist fundamentalist movements. Those who know the 
secrets of global terrorism and extremist organizations confirm 
that Tehran started decreasing its direct financial assistance 
to fundamentalist movements more than a year ago. They add that 
this does not mean Iran has stopped supporting and encouraging 
these groups; nor has it retreated from its plan to export the 
revolution and terrorism. However, its crushing economic crisis, 
austerity policy, and the Rafsanjani government's eagerness to 
improve its image by moving away from the major front for 
supporting terrorism, have all led to reducing the budget and 
financial support. Observers have seen this in Iran's way of 
dealing with its two principal allies, Sudan and Hizballah in 
Lebanon. After reducing aid to Khartoum to the point of refusing 
to supply it with free oil, the squeeze has been put on 
Hizballah in Lebanon; many of its institutions are now suffering 
from a decline in the volume of Iranian assistance. According to 
some information, Tehran now allocates less than $100 million 
annually to support these fundamentalist organizations, 
societies, and networks spread throughout the world, giving 
priority to terrorist cells. 
  What are the extremists doing, then, to cover this 
shortfall? 
Their budget requires many times what Tehran is offering, 
particularly as their activities and ambitions are constantly on 
the rise; money, too, is an important and vital resource for 
persuading the poor and deprived to join them, for building 
secret networks and training camps, arms purchases, and 
logistics. Sudan, which carries aloft the banner of 
pan-Islamism, cannot even feed itself. Some Arab regimes, such 
as Iraq and Libya, offer support, but it is conditional and 
linked to a specific tactic for a limited time, restricted to 
meager material capabilities of these two countries, bearing in 
mind that Libya recently opened a channel of aid to the 
Islamists, offering especially to the North Africans among them 
material and military support to damage the West. 
  Therefore it was necessary to find an alternative to Iranian 
funding, but in such a way as to please and placate Iran, as it 
still refuses to turn over its control of the "global Islamic 
revolution" to anyone else. Thus Iran took it upon itself to 
secure an alternative, and to help establish a new funding 
network for the fundamentalists, whose tentacles have been 
clearly exposed for months, to the surprise of many global 
observers, Arabs, and Muslims--including some of the Islamists. 
<H5>  The "Golden Triangle" Network </H5>
  What is the new network for funding the fundamentalists? How 
does it work? Who controls it? 
  The information obtained by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI was gathered 
from diverse sources, and drawn from secret reports recently 
prepared by Interpol, U.S. intelligence, the U.S. 
counter-narcotics bureau, and Arab and Western security agencies 
that have monitored this network for months. 
  These reports all agree that the principal sources of 
funding 
for the extremist Islamic movements today is drugs and 
smuggling. The information confirms that the pan-Islamist 
leadership has in the past--since the early 1970s, to be 
exact--been able to establish an international funding network 
combining terror, the drug mafia, and linked to at least one 
international mafia in relations to cooperate, coordinate, and 
swap expertise. While Peshawar today is a primary gathering 
point for the terrorists of the Muslim world, especially the 
Afghan Arabs, it is also an important center for the funding of 
this terror, and for supplying the world's fundamentalist 
networks with the funds they need for their activities. The 
information on funding sources for the extremist fundamentalists 
uncovered by the investigations of more than one Western and 
Arab security agency indicates that the Golden Crescent has 
taken Iran's place, with its approval and its active 
participation, in this funding process. The Golden Crescent is a 
term narcotics experts apply to the obscure regions of Pakistan, 
Afghanistan, and Iran, considered the world's second largest 
producer of opium--from which heroin is made--after the Golden 
Triangle (Burma, Thailand, Laos). 
  It is a known fact that all factions of the Afghan mojahedin 
have relied, and still rely, on drug revenues as a major 
resource for arms purchases, and thus a primary means of 
resuming the war among themselves. The present prime minister 
and chief of the Hezb-e Eslami, the radical Golboddin Hekmatyar, 
is considered one of the major drug traffickers in Afghanistan 
and the world; some sources describe him as being more 
important, and more dangerous, than Khun Sa, the drug lord in 
control of the Golden Triangle, and Pablo Escobar, the recently 
assassinated chief of Colombia's Medellin cartel. Hekmatyar is 
not new to the world of drug trafficking. The U.S. 
administration had prior knowledge of his activities in the 
opium world when it suggested that the CIA choose him as a 
preferred ally, above all the other mojahedin during the war 
against the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. At that time, 
Hekmatyar was able to broaden his activities and develop drug 
smuggling networks even into the United States--with the 
cooperation of senior Pakistani officers, working, in their 
turn, with some cabinet ministers, in the production and 
smuggling of opium from the Golden Crescent. 
  It is ironic that all this occurred with the active 
participation and energetic cooperation of CIA men. During the 
several years of the jihad against the Soviets and communism, 
dozens of trucks crossed the Pakistani border into Afghanistan 
every day, carrying arms guarded by Pakistani intelligence, and 
returning the following day carrying opium to be turned into 
heroin in more than 200 portable "kitchens" and secret 
laboratories all along the Pakistani frontier. All this was in 
the sight and hearing of the CIA and DEA (the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration), to the point that even some U.S. 
intelligence people joined the smuggling networks and 
facilitated the delivery of their goods to the United States in 
exchange for a percentage of the profits. There was also intense 
cooperation at the time between Hekmatyar, U.S. intelligence, 
and the Pakistani Bank of Credit and Commerce International 
network, to launder drug money and secure contact with arms 
dealers to supply the Afghan mojahedin. 
<H5>  U.S. Intelligence and Vietnamese Experts </H5>
  But it took time for the Soviets to leave Afghanistan; the 
mojahedin to triumph; Hekmatyar's coup against the United States 
and tilt towards Iran, to set up lines of close cooperation, 
some of them with extremist Islamic movements working under 
Iran's protection, for Washington and the West to feel the 
threat. They began to be wary of the dangerous relations between 
global and fundamentalist terror and drug trafficking, 
especially after the spread of the "Afghan Arabs" created and 
trained by the CIA in their home countries, and their part in 
terrorist operations against the existing regimes there. 
  In fact, the famous American lawyer Jack Blum, assigned by a 
congressional committee to study the connection between drug 
production and smuggling networks and terror funding, uncovered 
serious information that led him to direct an accusation at the 
Americans. He said, "For 10 years, we made this place one of the 
biggest international drug trafficking centers, and a major 
center for global terrorism. In plainer language, in 1979, the 
year of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Golden Triangle 
produced 200 tons of opium; production then saw a huge increase 
year after year. In years past, Hekmatyar had recourse to the 
services of Vietnamese experts who had experience in funding war 
with drugs. Experts estimate that next year the Golden 
Crescent's production will exceed that of the Golden Triangle; 
that is, more than 3,000 tons. This means that heroin revenues 
there will constitute the majority of international drug 
trafficking revenues, which are estimated at $500 billion per 
year, especially as they produce heroin, which is one of the 
most expensive drugs, with a per-kilo price ranging from $50,000 
(in Amsterdam) to $75,000 (in the U.S.)." 
  Furthermore, U.S. intelligence took part in building 
Hekmatyar's `empire' by opening large markets for the Golden 
Triangle's products, inside the United States, where the 
Pakistani-Afghani smuggling networks control the greater part of 
the U.S. heroin market, and introduced it to new and reliable 
smuggling corridors with the assistance of the CIA. 
  After the end of the Afghan jihad against the Soviets, 
Hekmatyar cooperated with Iran to build global smuggling 
networks, which were joined by a large number of Afghan Arabs 
and began to include, very gradually, extremist fundamentalist 
groups from several Arab and Islamic countries whose activities 
and distribution were prepared and coordinated to be a major 
financial resource for pan-fundamentalism. And so this network 
aimed at Europe through Iran, and thence to Turkey and Bulgaria. 
From there, they divided up among the countries of the (former) 
Eastern Bloc and Western Europe, especially Holland, Germany, 
France, and Italy. French statistics show that 70 percent of the 
heroin comes from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran. With the 
collapse of the Soviet Union, the Golden Crescent network 
expanded into these new countries, and cooperated with the 
republics of Central Asia, which in recent times have 
experienced an explosion in the cultivation of drugs with the 
cooperation of the Golden Crescent's `experts.' 
<H5>  Cooperation With the Mafia </H5>
  International reports confirm that the global fundamentalist 
drug network has succeeded in penetrating markets by close 
cooperation with the international mafias that have historically 
controlled them. Agreements were signed with the famous Sicilian 
Cosa Nostra, with many Russian mafias, and the local mafias in 
most countries. This cooperation with international mafias led 
to drugs-for-arms deals that play an important role in 
facilitating the delivery of all types of arms to extremist 
religious movements in most countries. The local networks 
introduced the extremists to secret and formerly unknown routes, 
through which they are able to infiltrate this or that country, 
and which also supply them with secret refuges to which to 
escape from the pursuit of security men. 
  The Interpol report recently revealed that a few months ago 
networks for smuggling drugs from from the Golden Crescent have 
made inroads into the dark continent, which has not been known 
for consuming drugs. According to this information, the African 
network uses Zanzibar and Mombasa (Kenya) as its two routes into 
east and west Africa. A number of Arab and African security 
reports indicate that this network belongs to the fundamentalist 
network. These markets were opened to fund the extremist Islamic 
movements active in Africa, which are based in Sudan. 
  Even more dangerous is the fact that the global 
fundamentalist funding network does not confine its activities 
to wholesale, but focuses on controlling the drug trafficking 
market with half wholesale and retail. Numerous security bureaus 
in Western Europe meet in this phenomenon, which was recently 
discovered while following and intensively monitoring the 
movements of the extremist Islamic networks in some European 
countries. French intelligence discovered that drug trafficking 
plays a major role in funding Algerian FIS cells and those of 
the Tunisian Ennahdah Movement, on its soil. They saw that there 
are complex and closely coordinated and organized networks 
controlled by Tunisians and Algerians. They have their own 
Pakistani supply network, specializing in smuggling heroin into 
Europe through Iran. The French security agencies had previously 
discovered, in investigating the backgrounds of the social and 
athletic clubs controlled by fundamentalists and pursuing drug 
dealers, that the true aim was not protecting Arab and Muslim 
immigrants from this plague, but controlling the market. The 
agencies noticed that some FIS members and some of the North 
African fundamentalists who sell smuggled and stolen goods in 
the "thieves' market" in Paris soon turn to selling drugs, as it 
gives them a bigger profit. Thus the share taken out to fund the 
Algerian fundamentalists is bigger. In Germany, Belgium, and 
Holland, the Turkish network linked to the fundamentalist 
network is in control. In most of the other European countries, 
this phenomenon has been clearly noticeable recently, without 
security agencies being able always to determine the link 
between the drug dealers and fundamentalist extremists. 
<H5>  Hekmatyar the New Leader </H5>
  Some reports go so far as to speak of a highly organized and 
prepared global fundamentalist network, assigning the tasks of 
all stages, from drug smuggling to distribution, by way of 
bartering them for arms and smuggling them to networks 
specializing in money laundering in several foreign banks in the 
Caribbean islands, the British isles, Europe, and some countries 
of Latin America, as well as banks in Los Angeles, Montreal, 
Luxembourg, Switzerland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, and Russia. 
  The information adds that every major fundamentalist 
movement 
active today in this or that Arab or Islamic country has a 
representative in charge of funding operations, securing money 
and arms, and linked to the leadership of this global network in 
the area under Hekmatyar's influence in Afghanistan. It appears 
that this network has been able to attract more Islamic factions 
than Iran, especially those that declined to announce their 
obedience to the Islamic Republic, preferring to maintain their 
independence and their ideology, opposed to Shiite 
fundamentalist hegemony. 
  For this reason, experts today agree that the primary leader 
of the new pan-Islamism is not Khamene'i, nor even Hasan 
al-Turabi, but Golboddin Hekmatyar, the main overseer of the 
drug trade in the Golden Crescent, and hence the main backer and 
"maestro" of the extremist fundamentalist movements. In the view 
of these experts, the reason that leaders of the global Islamic 
movements flock to Afghanistan--like Hasan al-Turabi, Rachid 
Ghannouchi, and others--is to coordinate with the new leader and 
seek his favor. Observers say that the recent war Hekmatyar 
waged against the group of President Rabbani and [Ahmad] Shah 
Mas'ud, with the cooperation of former American [as published] 
communist Dostam, was part of his new plan to take power in 
Afghanistan and proclaim it an Islamic republic, and the main 
base and refuge for extremist fundamentalist movements. For 
years, Hekmatyar's region has been a refuge for the Afghan Arabs 
and extremists fleeing their countries. Since Benazir Bhutto 
assumed power in Pakistan and announced her intention to expel 
the Afghan Arabs from Peshawar, Jalalabad has become the major 
alternative sanctuary for the Afghans and extremists, a 
gathering center for their leaders, such as Egyptian Shawqi 
al-Islambuli and Algerians Kamreddine Kherbane and Abdallah 
Anas, and the major planning and funding site for terrorist 
operations in the Arab and Islamic countries. 
  It is noteworthy that some religious groups tried in the 
beginning to criticize Islamists for resorting to this method of 
funding, especially as drugs are prohibited in Islam: not only 
their sale, but their cultivation, production, consumption, and 
storage. So much for the al-Turabi-Hekmatyar theory, which has 
spread through the ranks of the fundamentalists, that justifies 
this trade on the basis of waging war against the West, and the 
strategy of fragmenting its societies. This is what is generally 
claimed by some Islamic drug dealers in the streets of Paris, 
Rome, or Bonn: they say that they sell only to whites. More 
dangerous is that the promotion of this trade on a wide scale 
has led to the transformation of Third World countries, among 
them Islamic countries, from producing to consuming countries. 
It is noteworthy that Afghanistan and Pakistan have both become 
big consumers of drugs, as well as other Islamic and Arab 
countries that have recently experienced an increase in drug 
smuggling activities; there was also a strategy to corrupt Arab 
and Muslim society. It has already reached the point where some 
leaders of Islamic groups have issued religious rulings 
legitimizing drug smuggling and use as a means of mobilizing 
fighters to undertake suicide operations. This was seen in the 
Lebanese war, but with the militias of all sides; now it is seen 
in the suicide operations of some extremists in Algeria, where 
more than one report has revealed the fact that fighters were 
addicted to drugs before they took on dangerous attacks. In any 
case, drug trafficking is not the only forbidden sin committed 
by the extremists. It seems that the call of Shaykh Abdelbaki 
Sahraoui, imam of the Khalid Ibn Walid Mosque in Paris and 
co-founder of FIS, fell on deaf ears when he attacked those 
Islamists in a sermon and asked them to stop trafficking in 
smuggled goods. He reaffirmed that this was illegitimate and 
forbidden: "they would be better off selling flowers." As one 
Muslim clergyman said, "Is it not also forbidden for a Muslim to 
kill his Muslim brother?" But it appears that the extremist 
fundamentalists' new logic is that "the end justifies the 
means." The means that they recently used secures them funding 
that is comparable to the budgets of some rich countries. That 
is more important to them, even if they undertake the biggest 
defamation of the image of Islam by building mafia-style 
smuggling networks hiding behind Islamic values, without any of 
their members daring to oppose or question the health of their 
calling or their credibility.

cocaine paste, one of the biggest seizures in the past few 
years, and arrested Bolivians David Encina, 32, and Jose Encina, 
25, who introduced the drug to Chile apparently from the 
bordering township of Sajama, Cochabamba. They were about to 
deliver the drug in Arica. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 30

  Carabineros officers of Graneros today found a plantation of 
some 3,000 plants of marijuana concealed in a corn plantation in 
the Sixth Region. Carabineros confiscated an estimated 10 tons 
of marijuana. The brothers Francisco and Jose Pinilla, who 
rented the land where the plantation was found, were arrested. 
(Santiago Television Nacional de Chile Imagen Internacional in 
Spanish 0000 GMT 4 Feb 94) 
  Carabineros personnel have discovered three marijuana 
plantations in the Fifth, Sixth and Seven Regions. Carabineros 
Captain Enrique Haedo said 2,000 marijuana plants were 
discovered in San Clemente and the total weight of the crop was 
5 metric tons. Carabineros also found 95 marijuana plants, 
approximately 150 kg, in San Antonio. The (Chimbarongo) 
Carabineros detachment in San Fernando seize 50 marijuana 
plants. During the first seizure farmers Jose Domingo Amigo 
Moya,44, Juan Enrique Ramirez Avendano, 27, and Oscar Antonio 
Avendano Bustos, 46, were arrested and arraigned. According to 
Capt. Haedo a good portion of the marijuana seized was intended 
for the Vina del Mar Music Festival. (Santiago Radio Cooperativa 
Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 9 Feb 94) 
  Members of the Carabineros OS-7 antinarcotics brigade have 
discovered a plantation of 700 plants of marijuana, some 130 to 
230 centimeters tall, in Quebrada de Amolana, near Ovalle, in 
the Fourth Region. It has been determined that the plantation, 
almost ready to be harvested, weighs approximately 1.6 metric 
tons. (Santiago Radio Cooperativa in Spanish 1000 GMT 10 Feb 94)

  Dinar, National Narcotics Directorate, personnel have seized 
1,700 kg of very pure cocaine hydrochloride during a raid of a 
house on Juana de Lara and Lomas Valentina Streets in the city 
of Pedro Juan Caballero. They arrested the owner of the house 
Dora Gonzalez de Fernandez, 42, and her husband Fortunato 
Fernandez Amaral. Two cartels have appeared in Amambay 
Department and it is feared that traffickers will engage in 
bloody attacks this year. The Special Commando Force has begun 
a clean-up operation in San Pedro and Amambay Departments, where 
it destroyed six hectares of marijuana plants near the Aguaray 
River and 11 hectares in the Yby Yu district owned by drug 
trafficker Sebastian Spencer, who was arrested in Sao Paulo. 
(Asuncion NOTICIAS in Spanish 4 Feb 94 p 50) 
  Two weeks ago the Dinar Regional Office No. 1, with the 
cooperation of the Special Commando Forces, began "Operation Hot 
Summer" in San Pedro Department. The operation resulted in the 
discovery of a clandestine airstrip at Carumbe farm, which 
belongs to Elio Morinigo Gimenez, 70 km south of San Pedro city. 
So far the antinarcotics forces have destroyed 21 marijuana 
plantations, which represent some 70 tonnes of marijuana, and 
seized two vehicles, revolvers, rifles, and shotguns. The 
presence of antinarcotics forces has stopped two cartels from 
struggling for the monopoly of the traffic of cocaine, ether, 
acetone, and weapons between this city and Santa Cruz, Bolivia. 
It is believed that the powerful traffickers are building a 
bunker to prevent the cocaine from being detected by satellite.

  The Montevideo police arrested an Uruguayan drug trafficker 
and are searching for three Bolivian criminals who are members 
of the so-called "Bolivian link" that transports cocaine from 
Uruguay to Europe. The detainee received 0.5 kg of cocaine for 
each shipment he managed to send to Europe. He has already been 
arrested in Germany and in the United States on charges of 
murder and drug trafficking. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1730 GMT 5

  [Text] During a meeting in La Paz, Bolivia, to discuss the 
struggle against drug trafficking, Chilean and Bolivian 
government representatives agreed to exchange information on 
juridical affairs, customs, drug trafficking and the prevention 
of drug abuse, and social rehabilitation programs. 
  Gustavo Villalobos, secretary of the Chilean National 
Council 
for Drug Control, noted that the level of cooperation between 
the two countries is very high even though they do not maintain 
diplomatic relations. 
  Villalobos added that the bilateral cooperation efforts to 
fight trafficking also benefit other countries of the region. 
  Bolivian Social Defense Secretary Marcos Solis said the 
struggle against trafficking requires considerable international 
solidarity. 
  The two countries agreed to exchange judicial resolutions 
and 
letters rogatory. [sentence as received] The representatives 
also discussed the possibility of extraditing traffickers.

  [Editorial report] Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese, in its 7 February issue, publishes a 400-word 
article by Andre Lozano about Europeans coming to buy cocaine in 
Leticia, Colombia, on the border with Brazil, and in Tabatinga, 
in Amazonas State. 
  According to the Amazon Federal Police, the article states, 
the arrest during the past three months of four Europeans 
carrying cocaine at the Manaus International Airport "shows that 
foreign traffickers are purchasing drugs from the Leticia 
Cartel" because, "traffickers are being greatly persecuted on 
the Solimoes River" by the Floating Police Station. 
  The article describes the arrest, on different occasions, of 
Reinhard Gerush, 36, German, with 5.9 kg of cocaine; Fabrizio 
Orlandini, Italian, and Joaquim Mendoza, Spanish, with 6.8 kg of 
cocaine; and Josep Maria Boada, with 4 kg of cocaine. 
  A 200-word insert on the same page states that the Amazon 
Federal Police confiscated 800 kg of cocaine during 1993 and 
that the Floating Federal Police Station confiscated 22.4 kg of 
cocaine in December alone.

  [Text] Federal Police already know the modus operandi of 
the arms smuggling network that supplies Rio de Janeiro drug 
traffickers. Fifty people working at Rio de Janeiro's 
international airport are being checked. 
  Otto Gomes de Miranda is the man police have charged with 
leading the gang that sells arms to Rio de Janeiro drug 
traffickers. Otto might be the chief of detective (Luiz Eduardo 
Satto) and informer (Luiz Etienne), who last week was arrested 
carrying ammunition and 22 kg of cocaine, which was to have been 
delivered in Rio de Janeiro's hills. 
  Otto, who is now calmly resting at the Tijuca resort in 
western Rio de Janeiro, served a 14-month prison term in the 
United States. He denies the arms smuggling charges: 
  [Begin recording] That's a lie because everyone knows and it 
is public and noticeable that I was arrested in the United 
States with some arms. Those arms were all legal. [end recording] 
  There is something police are sure of. The arms used by the 
traffickers in the hills come from Miami and Panama, and they 
enter Brazil through the Rio de Janeiro international airport. 
  Rio de Janeiro Federal Police Superintendent Edson de 
Oliveira knows the arms are unloaded directly from the planes 
and then escorted by the gangs to ships hidden at Governador 
Island, where the airport is located. 
  According to Federal Revenue Department officials, 
supervision is precarious because of a personnel shortage. In 
days with many flights, one supervisor has to check 124 
passengers. 
  For 18 months now, Federal Police have investigated the 
people who work at Rio de Janeiro international airport. Police 
arrived at a conclusion: There are several gangs engaged in 
arms smuggling at the airport. Some of them have members from 
the Federal Police. 
  [Begin Edson de Oliveira recording] We are investigating 
approximately 50 people who probably are engaged in arms 
smuggling in that airport. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Feb (AFP) -- Colombian 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said today he was surprised 
when President Cesar Gaviria said U.S. troops are in the country 
supporting the antidrug-trafficking struggle. De Greiff added 
he opposes this help. 
  De Greiff, known for his hard position against drug 
traffickers and the strongest persecutor of Pablo Escobar, the 
dead chief of the Medellin Cartel, said: "I do not believe we 
need the help of foreign troops to fight drug trafficking; we 
have done more than any other country to fight it and have never 
needed their help." 
  De Greiff also said he "had absolutely no idea" the U.S. 
soldiers were helping the Colombian Armed Forces in the 
antidrug-trafficking struggle. "I do not like to be lied to," 
the prosecutor general added. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 7 Feb (EFE) -- The television 
newscast Q.A.P today revealed documents from the personal files 
of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the slain head of the Medellin Cartel, 
which compromise politicians, judges, officers, and other 
personalities. Included among the documents is a video that 
shows a cartel member asking Escobar not to kill him and 
reminding him of his involvement in terrorist attacks, 
kidnappings, and alleged intercessions in Cuba before someone 
identified as Raul Castro. 
  Although the video does not mention the contact's position, 
it is believed to be Raul Castro, brother of Cuban President 
Fidel Castro and commander of that country's Armed Forces. 
  It also mentions without naming them some people close to 
former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, according to 
the television newscast. 
  The documents, which include photographs, videos, and 
letters, reveal the irregularities committed at Envigado's La 
Catedral prison, where Escobar has held for almost a year with 
14 of his most sinister lieutenants, who held loud, bawdy 
parties with hundreds of persons illegally entering the 
facility. Trials were even held against members of the Medellin 
Cartel. Escobar also had secret documents belonging to the DEA 
and various Colombian state entities. He had the names, 
addresses, and telephone numbers of people who testified against 
him and reports on bribes he paid to judges and politicians. 
  The authorities also found among Escobar's possessions 
documents belonging to the Cali Cartel, but the greatest share 
of the papers consisted of letters from people and institutions 
asking him for money for different purposes, among them a letter 
from a community of nuns requesting his "good offices" for a 
social project. The father of the killer of presidential 
hopeful Bernardo Jaramillo went to La Catedral to ask for money 
to purchase a home and thus reward the "courage" of his son, who 
was barely 15 years old when he was killed in the ensuing 
reaction by bodyguards of the Patriotic Union candidate. 
  With the discovery of Escobar's personal files, the 
authorities have been able to clarify many deaths, kidnappings, 
and attacks perpetrated on the orders of this major drug 
trafficker and terrorist, who was killed in a shoot out with 
police on 2 December in Medellin.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] The Special Investigations Branch of the Attorney 
General's Office has uncovered a complex network that, in 
exchange for bribes, legalized operations by pilots working for 
drug traffickers. Nine officials of Civil Aeronautics took part 
in the illegal activities which ranged from forging logbooks to 
expunging drug trafficking records. 
  By way of a random sample survey, the Attorney General's 
Office found that over the past three years, officials under 
investigation issued at least 33 illegal licenses to private and 
commercial pilots. The Attorney General's Office then opened a 
formal investigation against the officials involved in the scam. 
  The Attorney General's Office also sent a copy of the file 
to 
the Prosecutor General's Office in order that it could begin 
criminal proceedings against Civil Aeronautics officials. The 
Attorney General's Office also requested an investigation of 
three private attorneys who collaborated with the network and 
who have been fully identified. It also requested an 
investigation of 33 pilots who, according to the office, 
received the forged documents and licenses. Aviation schools 
that reportedly participated in the scam also will be 
investigated. 
  The officials forged documents such as pilot licenses and 
flying records, certificates on drug trafficking records (that 
legally should be issued by the National Drug Directorate), high 
school diplomas, and even health certificates. According to 
what EL TIEMPO has been able to establish, initial 
investigations show that most of the "clients" of these Civil 
Aeronautics officials were pilots working for the mafia--pilots 
who otherwise could not legally obtain clean drug trafficking 
records. 
  The officials who are being investigated by the Attorney 
General's Office for their presumed links to the network include 
Ruben Dario Rios, former head of the Technical Control Division; 
Angel Mario Pinzon Melo, head of the Aeronautics Personnel 
Group; Hernando Barrera Astudillo, Jorge Enrique Diaz, Guillermo 
Fetecua Castiblanco, and Roberto Duarte of the Technical Control 
Division; Eva Bermudez, former head of the Auditor's Office; and 
Fabio Moyanp, a Civil Aeronautics detective. 
  Regarding the "sale of flying hours," the Attorney General's 
Office learned about one of the most obvious forging cases. The 
Special Investigations Branch examined the case of a pilot who 
only had 500 hours in his professional flying record, but, after 
paying a large amount of money, he obtained a certificate for 
1,800 flying hours. By paying a bribe, the pilot saved himself 
at least three years of work. In addition, a higher number of 
flying hours enables the pilot to take courses to operate larger 
planes. 
  A statement by an Aeronautics Control Division assistant 
confirmed that in order "to negotiate" an increase in flying 
hours, the pilot filed a complaint on the presumed theft of the 
logbook. Subsequently, the pilot, assisted by a corrupt 
official, recorded the number of hours he wanted to have in his 
new flying record. The scam could also work in reverse--that 
is, the pilots recorded the additional flying hours in their 
logs, and the official put them down in the Civil Aeronautics' 
registry. 
  The Special Investigations Branch proved that having pilots 
who do not have the experience they are supposed to have is a 
threat to the country's air safety. The Attorney General's 
Office said that reports of air accidents in Colombia show that, 
in many cases, the "human factor" of pilot error played a major 
role. In addition, the Special Investigations Branch found an 
administrative disorder in Civil Aeronautics that, coupled with 
the officials' dishonesty, left room for these irregularities. 
This is why the Attorney General's Office advised Civil 
Aeronautics to establish effective controls in the process of 
issuing licenses to pilots.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The military 
chiefs of the weakened Medellin Cartel in Colombia are willing 
to negotiate a peace agreement with the enemies of that dreadful 
organization to prevent their total extermination, the local 
press revealed today. 
  According to EL TIEMPO, during the past 70 days the 
survivors 
of the Medellin Cartel who are currently in jail have 
unsuccessfully sent letters to their emissaries in Cali, the 
country's third largest city, seeking a peace agreement with the 
Mafia in that region. 
  Some time ago, the clandestine group "Pepes" [Persecuted by 
Pablo Escobar], reportedly made up of members of the Cali 
Cartel, announced it would reactivate its struggle against the 
men of slain drug trafficker Pablo Escobar until all the members 
of the once powerful organization are exterminated. 
  "Afraid of what could happen to them--after Escobar's 
death--the terrorist chiefs of the Medellin Cartel have offered 
to pay their debts in jail and for the first time have 
considered the possibility of dismantling whatever is left of 
their armed redoubts," the newspaper said. "In exchange, they 
have requested respect for their relatives' lives and 
negotiations for their money and properties," with Pablo 
Escobar's widow Maria Victoria Henao. 
  Since its creation a year ago, "Pepes" has killed more than 
50 of Pablo Escobar's men and destroyed some 30 properties 
belonging to the Medellin Cartel. According to the police, the 
hunt for the survivors of the Medellin Cartel who are free has 
continued after Escobar's death and this is keeping the people 
related to this organization in a state of fear. The source 
said that "the authorities have evidence related to the killing 
of several cartel agents in Medellin one week ago." 
  One of Escobar's trusted men has said: "Either we kneel or 
they kill us all." This man has confirmed that the terrorist 
chiefs of the cartel are making efforts to secure a peace 
agreement with their enemies.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Bill Clinton has finally announced his 
counternarcotics policy. He will step up the fight against drug 
consumption in the United States and will give more economic 
support to eradication and substitution of drug cultivation in 
drug-producing countries. Miriam Ortiz has the report on what 
that program means for Colombia. 
  [Begin recording] [Ortiz] President Bill Clinton's new 
counternarcotics program has four fundamental objectives. The 
first is to reduce demand. This is the most important goal of 
the new strategy. Budgets for prevention, treatment, and 
education programs will be increased. The second objective is 
to reduce drug-related violence. The U.S. Government will 
appoint 100 policemen [as heard] to prevent crime in the streets 
and will ask Congress to pass more controls and requirements on 
gun ownership. The third objective is to reject the 
legalization and decriminalization of illegal drugs. The fourth 
is to request international cooperation. 
  According to the drug czar [Lee Brown], the U.S. Government 
will continue to be a strong ally of countries that have 
demonstrated a political willingness to fight drug trafficking. 
  [Brown, in English with superimposed translation into 
Spanish] It's very important that we do not open our borders to 
the Escobars of the world to bring drugs in at will. That is 
why we will continue our program to ban drugs. 
  [Ortiz] The U.S. Government believes that Colombia has one 
of 
the most successful counternarcotics programs, so its budget 
will not be reduced. 
  [Gabriel Silva, Colombian ambassador to Washington] In 
addition to support for efforts to reduce consumption, the new 
program includes institutional support, which will strengthen 
justice and democratic institutions. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Feb (PL) -- Carlos Lage, vice 
president of the Cuban Council of State, described reports of 
Raul Castro's alleged ties to the Medellin drug trafficking 
cartel as infamous and offensive. 
  Lage, who is on an official visit to Colombia, was 
interviewed by RCN Radio Network and the newspaper EL ESPECTADOR 
regarding reports that a videocassette showed an alleged member 
of the Cartel appearing before Pablo Escobar--who was killed 
recently--requesting his aid to contact Raul Castro, minister of 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba. 
  The morals and ethics of the Cuban revolution have been 
tested throughout its history. Neither narcotics nor corruption 
have stained it. We, therefore, do not have the slightest 
concern about that, the Cuban leader told EL ESPECTADOR. 
  He noted that Raul Castro "enjoys great prestige and the 
love 
of our people." Lage did not rule out the possibility that this 
accusation is part of "a manipulation by the enemies of the 
revolution" who have tried incessantly to involve the island in 
drug trafficking. 
  Lage told RCN that Cuba has the fewest drug problems of any 
country in the world because there is no consumption, 
corruption, or organized crime.

  [Text] Bags of cocaine that washed up on the coasts of 
Villa Clara, Ciego de Avila, Camaguey, and Guantanamo were 
incinerated by Ministry of the Interior workers and troops in 
the ovens of large industries of the country during 1993. We are 
referring to drugs that international traffickers lost during 
operations close to the territorial waters of Cuba. As on other 
occasions, members of the National Antidrug Commission, the 
Ministry of the Interior, and a representative of the Public 
Prosecutor's Office performed the analysis and certified the 
incineration of the 2.5 tons of cocaine that washed up on our 
coasts. This act affirms that Cuba's policy of confronting the 
actions of international drug trafficking remains unchanged.

  [Text] After an eight-month investigation, the National 
Police of Ecuador have broken up a powerful drug trafficking 
gang that had been operating internationally. This operation was 
coordinated with Mexican authorities who, through Operation 
"Azteca," have in recent days confiscated almost a ton of 
cocaine in Mexico. 
  The drug traffickers were illicitly sending cocaine from 
Colombia to the United States through Mexico, and a large part 
of their illegal profits were returned to Ecuador to be invested 
in real estate and luxury items. 
  On 28 December 1993 the police began the antidrug operation. 
The organization in Mexico was led by Humberto Segundo 
Montenegro Freire, a Colombian citizen now being held by the 
Mexican authorities; 20 other persons in his organization, who 
were Colombian, Mexican, and Spanish nationals, were also 
arrested. 
  A number of Humberto Montenegro's close relatives lived in 
Quito, including his mother, Clara Freire, his siblings, 
Fernando Montenegro, Cecilia Montenegro, Carlos Montenegro, and 
Liliana Montenegro, and his brother-in-law, Modesto Polo Perez. 
They received the money that Humberto Montenegro sent from 
Mexico, and invested it in real estate, luxury cars, jewels, and 
other items. These funds were brought to Ecuador by couriers who 
traveled back and forth between Mexico and Ecuador. 
  Operation "Azteca" was set up after the seizure of almost a 
ton of cocaine in Mexico on 18 and 19 December 1993, leading to 
the arrest of Humberto Montenegro and 20 of his colleagues. 
After this operation in Mexico, and with confirmation of 
intelligence reports on money transfers to Ecuador, the National 
Police initiated Operation "Azteca" in Ecuador, acting in 
coordination with Mexican authorities. This operation led to the 
arrest of 11 persons and the seizure of a number of properties, 
weapons, jewels, and numerous luxury cars. 
  After the operation, numerous bank accounts used by members 
of the organization were identified. The police, acting in 
coordination with the appropriate authorities, are investigating 
the identities and movements of these accounts. Police sources 
have said that since these inquiries have just begun, it will 
not be possible to provide further information at this time. 
  The police stated that, at the time this report was 
released, 
there were no indications that Ecuadoran banks were supporting 
or abetting these illicit activities. However, the 
investigations are continuing, and they remain in contact with 
officials from the Office of the Attorney General of Mexico, in 
order to exchange information that may aid in the investigative 
process in both countries. For that reason, an Ecuadoran 
National Police delegation will soon visit Mexico. 
  The Ecuadoran police are working every day to maintain civil 
peace in Ecuador, reported official police spokespersons.

  [Text] Quito--The family of drug money launderers arrested 
last week by Interpol agents in Operation "Azteca" handled 
considerable sums of money--over 5 billion sucres--according to 
preliminary calculations by the National Police. 
  The police report that the members of this organization of 
alleged money launderers had lived in Quito since 1987, so it is 
assumed that in the last seven years they have conducted a 
number of illicit money laundering activities, whose extent will 
be determined as the investigations progress. 
  In addition to the weapons and communications equipment 
confiscated by the police, a number of items and real estate 
properties were seized, including expensive jewelry collections 
valued at about $500,000 (approximately 1 billion sucres). 
<H5>  Seizures </H5>
  Police spokespersons reported yesterday that to date 90 
percent of the money launderers' assets have been confiscated. 
These items include the house at No. 258 Calle Hidalgo de Pinto 
y De la Alcabalas in the residential area of El Bosque which, 
the police say, with all its contents, could be worth more than 
$700,000 (over 1.4 billion sucres). 
  The Montenegro Freire family lived in this three-story house 
with a penthouse, and from here they ran their illegal 
businesses, using as a cover the luxury automobile dealership 
located at Avenida Amazonas and Santa Maria. 
  In this house the police found a collection of 28 paintings 
by a variety of artists, whose commercial value has not been 
determined; it will, however, be several billion sucres. The 
other assets, two apartments in exclusive Quito neighborhoods, 
are valued at over 1 billion sucres. 
<H5>  Bank Accounts </H5>
  According to the police, the persons arrested had numerous 
accounts in various banks in Ecuador. Huge sums in both foreign 
and national currency have been deposited in the last two years. 
  The investigations are continuing in order to determine the 
precise amount of money the Montenegro Freire family had. 
  The police have said that details on the group's financial 
movements will be released in the next few hours. Only the 8 
million sucres seized in the initial raid have now been 
reported. This amount was found in their residence. 
<H5>  Vehicles </H5>
  So far 10 vehicles of different makes and models have been 
seized, as well as three brand new motorcycles. The automobiles 
included: a dark red BMW with no license plates valued at 260 
million sucres; a red BMW with license plates PLH-058, valued at 
100 million sucres; a black Mercedes-Benz with license plates 
PLH-169, valued at 253 million sucres. 
  The other vehicles were: a Chevy van with license plates 
OBZ-014, valued at 140 million sucres; another Chevy van with 
license plates GCN-284 (same price as the first); a Chevrolet 
Swift, license plates IBL-704; a Chevrolet Vitara jeep, license 
plates PLT-922; a Lancia PKG-188; a Suzuki Forsa, license plates 
PHL-107; and another Suzuki Forsa, with plates PHL-706. 
  There were also three motorcycles valued at 51 million 
sucres: a Yamaha, a Honda, and a Suzuki.

  [Text] Quito--The chief of operations of the police, 
Colonel Telmo Erazo, revealed that two police officers were 
directly involved in the illicit activities of the Colombian 
money laundering gang that was broken up in Quito last week 
through Operation "Azteca." 
  According to EL UNIVERSO's exclusive report, Lieutenant Hugo 
Alfredo Jativa Sotomayor and Second Lieutenant Wilson Marcelo 
Salgado Guzman are cited in the preliminary police report on the 
money laundering activities conducted in Ecuador during the past 
seven years by the Colombian Montenegro Freire family. 
  The two uniformed police officers working in the Immigration 
Service (Jativa in Guayaquil and Salgado in Quito) were used to 
facilitate the entry of couriers bringing money from Mexico that 
was sent by the group's leader, Humberto Montenegro, a Colombian 
drug trafficker with ties to a well-organized drug trafficking 
cartel headed by his compatriot Antonio Bermudez. 
  The report also states that in addition to helping the 
couriers to elude customs and immigration inspections, 
Lieutenant Jativa is also charged with extortion from a member 
of the money laundering family, as he demanded $10,000 for 
supposedly diverting the police and for support activities. 
<H5>  More Officers Implicated </H5>
  Colonel Erazo did not deny that other police officers may 
also be involved indirectly with the money launderers. He said 
this will be established during the course of the investigations. 
  The police report also lists the name of Captain Fernando 
Navarro who, according to the investigation, knew of these 
illegal operations. For eight months this officer even had in 
his possession a 9-mm weapon belonging to Fernando Montenegro 
Freire, a member of the gang now broken up by the police. 
<H5>  Police Arrested </H5>
  Jativa and Salgado were arrested at the order of the General 
Command. After the investigation has been completed, the two 
officers will be turned over to the civilian courts, to be tried 
along with the gang members. Before that they will be discharged 
from the police, indicated Erazo. 
  Captain Navarro was also arrested, and his situation is 
being 
reviewed by a police tribunal. It is expected that he will also 
be discharged since, although he was not involved in the illicit 
actions conducted by the money launderers and his 
comrades-in-arms, he knew of their activities. 
<H5>  Member of Powerful Cartel </H5>
  Colombian national Humberto Segundo Montenegro Freire, the 
head of the money laundering gang broken up by the Ecuadoran 
police, is a member of one of Colombia's most powerful drug 
cartels. 
  According to media accounts in Mexico, based on 
investigations by the PGR [Office of the Attorney General] of 
Mexico, Montenegro Freire, who was also known as Alberto 
Rodriguez Garcia or Alberto Garcia Aleman, had ties to a major 
drug trafficking organization headed by another Colombian, 
Antonio Bermudez. 
  On 18 and 19 December 1993, in an operation conducted in 
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, PGR agents struck a harsh blow to 
the Bermudez gang by arresting 21 of its members, who were 
caught with 711 kilos of pure cocaine. Also seized were six 
automobiles of the latest models, a tanker type armored vehicle, 
and a passenger bus. 
  Among the persons arrested was Humberto Segundo Montenegro 
Freire, the leader of the group laundering drug money in 
Ecuador. He had been sending large amounts of money to his 
relatives in Quito, which they used to buy real estate and other 
assets as a means of laundering this dirty money. 
  In Mexico the Bermudez drug trafficking organization 
distributed Colombian drugs from the southeast to various points 
of Mexico, including well-known tourism spots like Cancun.

  [Text] Quito--Police Lieutenant Alfredo Jativa Sotomayor, 
arrested for his direct connection with the "Azteca" money 
laundering group, was paid $400 for each suitcase containing 
hundreds of thousands of drug dollars coming from Mexico and 
Colombia. This money entered Ecuador without any control, 
according to the Interpol report on the activities in Ecuador of 
the Colombian Montenegro Freire gang, which has been broken up 
by the police. 
  According to investigations into the participation of two 
police officers in the money launderers' illicit activities, 
Jativa Sotomayor not only received the "fee" listed above, which 
was arranged in advance, but every so often he also received 
special bonus payments from the leader of the criminal 
organization, Humberto Montenegro Freire, who often came to 
Ecuador to monitor his illegal business ventures, in which his 
siblings, Fernando Javier, Juan Carlos, Liana Elizabeth, and 
Maria Cecilia Montenegro Freire, were also involved. 
  To carry out his task, this officer had the services of 
Quito 
customs appraiser Victor Hugo Valdiviezo, best known by his 
nickname of "Tocayo," who was also paid large amounts of money 
in dollars to avoid customs inspections. This man is now a 
fugitive. 
<H5>  Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars </H5>
  It is estimated that in the last two years the Colombian 
drug 
dealers paid the lieutenant more than $50,000 to allow this 
dirty money to enter freely, which "was coming in growing 
amounts with great frequency. It was hundreds of thousands of 
dollars," says the police report. 
  Two months ago Jativa was paid $7,000, which he used to buy 
a 
Hyundai Pony from the "Autos y Carros" dealership owned by the 
now arrested Montenegro Freire family. 
  On an earlier occasion, drug dealer Humberto Montenegro gave 
a pistol and a collection of dollars to Jessica Menendez, the 
officer's wife. 
  Finally, Jativa somehow learned of "Operation Azteca" and 
decided to extort $10,000 from the drug dealers, supposedly to 
halt the investigation. 
<H5>  Protection </H5>
  According to the investigations, it is possible that the 
police officers who have been arrested may also have provided 
protection to the money launderers' business activities by 
passing on material intended solely for police use, for which it 
is assumed that they were paid. 
  At the "Autos y Carros" dealership the police found three 
teargas canisters of the 515 CS type, two Stun grenades, a 
Truflite carbine teargas canister, and a handgrenade simulator. 
At the house at 258 Calle Hidalgo de Pinto, where 11 of the 
persons implicated in the "Azteca" group were arrested, another 
teargas canister was found. All these items are intended solely 
for police use. 
<H5>  Accomplices </H5>
  The other officer, Second Lieutenant Wilson Marcelo Salgado 
Guzman, was apprehended during the night of Tuesday, 28 December 
at the Montenegros' residence. The report states that he was a 
close friend of the family and knew of their illegal activities. 
He was the person responsible for the removal of the suitcases 
containing dirty money. He also accompanied the local head of 
the group, Fernando Montenegro, on two trips to Colombia to 
bring in contraband merchandise. 
  When he was on guard duty, he even allowed Fernando 
Montenegro access to the San Antonio Hacienda near Santo Domingo 
de los Colorados, confiscated from Jorge Hugo Reyes Torres. 
  He also kept in his possession a 9-mm pistol that Fernando 
Montenegro gave him. 
  Captain Fernando Navarro, as a loan, received a 
chrome-plated 
9-mm Baretta from the local head of the "Azteca" group. He kept 
this weapon for nine months, and only returned it in response to 
pressure from a superior officer, whose name was not released. 
  Concerning this officer, the report says: "Navarro knew that 
Fernando Montenegro had this weapon in his possession and did 
nothing about it, thus failing to fulfill his legal obligation."

  [Text] Quito--The money laundering gang recently broken up 
by the police in Operation "Azteca" used a variety of methods to 
bring into Ecuador an amount exceeding $2.5 million the result 
of drug trafficking, according to an Interpol report. 
  One courier was Colombian national Sandra Liliana Angel 
Gutierrez, the current companion of the drug trafficker just 
arrested in Mexico. Others were her compatriots Areli Cacho, 
Nora Martinez Pelaez, Alejandro and Luis Alberto Gutierrez 
Flores, Marisol N., Marco N., and Andrea N. These persons 
frequently visited Ecuador and brought in dollars attached to 
their bodies. 
  On other occasions the money was carried in suitcases. To 
pass through customs without being checked, police officers Hugo 
Jativa and Wilson Salgado, as well as customs appraiser Victor 
Hugo Valdiviezo, worked with the gang. 
  Another method for bringing in drug money was the use of 
express delivery services like DHL, EMS, and World Courier. 
  The police report also says that another method they used 
was 
bank transfers, whose final destination was Bogota. From there, 
the foreign currency was sent to Ipiales, where exchange trader 
Gerardo Villota (currently a fugitive and closely connected with 
the criminal organization), exchanged these funds for Colombian 
pesos and deposited them in one of the many bank accounts opened 
by Modesto Polo Perez, who was arrested here on 28 December. 
  Those pesos were withdrawn in amounts that did not violate 
the legal limits set by Colombia, and were then converted into 
sucres and brought to Quito to be used to buy checks in dollars 
and to purchase assets and real estate, vehicles, and commercial 
property. 
  As the police have already reported, it is estimated that 
over $2.5 million entered Ecuador, particularly during the last 
two of the seven years during which the Montenegro Freire family 
has lived in this city. This amount does not include the money 
deposited in numerous bank accounts. These accounts have been 
frozen and are now being investigated to determine the financial 
movements of the Azteca criminal organization.

<F P=106> [Article by Hector Adorno Ruiz] </F>
  [Text] In one of the most important operations against the 
drug traffic conducted by the Office of the Attorney General of 
the Republic [PGR], Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents 
confiscated a shipment of nearly 53 kg of heroin. Worth over 200 
million new pesos on the black market, it would have been used 
to process more than 2 million doses. The operation was carried 
out in the town of Ensenada, Baja California, where the agents 
also captured four Thai, two Mexicans, and a Lao belonging to an 
international drug trafficking ring. 
  In this connection, the PGR reported: "One of the most 
severe 
blows recorded in the history of this effort was dealt to the 
heroin dealers. Therefore, the investigations will be continued, 
so as to capture all the members of the criminal group." 
  Through its representative in Baja California State, Arturo 
Ochoa Palacios, and the Federal Judicial Police deputy 
commissioner, Raul Loza Parra, the PGR announced that the 
following were captured during the operation: Seachao Vern 
Chieng, a native of Laos and resident of the United States; Phan 
Saeng Vern, a Thai naturalized as a U.S. citizen; Vang Yao Fow, 
Seaphan Sou On, and Seaphan Aecho (also from Thailand, but 
residents of the neighboring country to the north); and the 
Mexican women, Maricruz Barrera and Armida Aldaco. 
  The officials stressed that those arrested admitted their 
guilt of all the charges of crimes against health brought 
against them. Consequently, within the next few hours they will 
be remanded to the pertinent federal authorities. 
  As for the manner in which the arrests were made, the 
officials noted that a surveillance operation was implemented 
for several weeks, after the detection of two cardboard boxes 
containing heroin that had been transported by the Postal 
Service delivery unit. They had originally been sent to 
Thailand, and later returned to Mexico, for no apparent reason. 
  The sources indicated that the mailing and return operation 
took place on several occasions, attracting the detectives' 
attention. 
  They added: "At the fourth postal administrative office, 
Federal Judicial Police agents located a third cardboard box 
holding 18 bars of toilet soap. When the shipment was inspected 
in the presence of the federal public prosecutor, eight packets 
were found containing pure heroin with a gross weight of one kg 
and 726 grams." 
  "Furthermore, at the administrative office of the Mexican 
Postal Service's Francisco Zarco Branch, the Federal Judicial 
Police found two boxes with similar features that had been sent 
from Thailand. They contained several packages wrapped in 
plastic, holding heroin with a gross weight of 9.706 kg." 
  Ochoa Palacios added that the probe was continued and, as a 
result, PJF personnel, backed by the Federal Highway Police, 
intercepted the drivers of a Chevrolet sedan with Baja 
California plates. They were identified as Phan Saeng Vern, Vang 
Yao Fow, Seaphan Sou On, Seachao Vern Chieng, and Seaphan Aecho. 
A few days earlier, these individuals had attempted to retrieve 
the boxes containing the drugs at the Postal Service offices in 
Ensenada. 
  Addressing the federal public prosecutor, who opened 
preliminary investigation 19/94, the subjects stated, with the 
aid of a translator, that they had already managed to move large 
heroin shipments to the United States, using a "bridge" 
established between Asia and Mexico. 
  They revealed that they were sending boxes containing soap 
and shampoo to Thailand, and that the containers were emptied in 
that country and filled with heroin, for subsequent return to 
Mexico by air, using the "merchandise returns" service. On 
Mexican territory, they arranged to have the shipments picked up 
in the parcel post area, assigning other persons to do this, in 
order to avoid arousing suspicion. 
  With the information that they provided, the federal agents 
captured Maricruz Barrera who, upon her arrest, informed them 
that three suitcases containing drugs were at the residence of 
her friend, Armida Aldaco, located in the second section of 
Ensenada's Colonia Francisco Villa. After searching the site, 
the agents found the bags in a closet, and turned them over to 
the public prosecutor, Luis Ibanez Cornejo, who found 42 kg of 
heroin inside. 
  The PGR representative reported that the narcotics were to 
be 
sold in the towns of Visalia, Santa Ana, and Fresno, California. 
  He also noted that Alfonso Romero Verdugo, employed as head 
of the MexPost department of the Mexican Postal Service, at the 
No. 1 main post office in Ensenada, was arrested. The presumed 
drug traffickers claimed that they had given him money for his 
cooperation in receiving and sending the packages containing 
heroin.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Edmundo Gonzalez Llaca] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the Lacandona Jungle Declaration, the 
Zapatista Army of National Liberation voiced, among other 
things, its protest against "the attempts to discredit the just 
cause of our struggle, accusing it of drug trafficking, 
`narco'-guerrilla activity, and banditry, and using other labels 
that our enemies might apply." Suspicious as I am, I recalled 
the wisdom of the popular proverb: "explanation not sought, 
accusation obvious." In case there were any doubts, I decided to 
investigate the matter. [passage omitted] 
  We are talking about an austere number: 2,000 members 
carrying firearms of various types and calibers, ranging from 
pistols to military grenades. In its report, the Government 
Secretariat stresses that the weaponry "is new for the most 
part." The warring group has been training for at least a year. 
  Such an army, and its respective "training," requires 
something more than ideology and animosity. In brief, could the 
drug traffic, present in the seasoning of all stews in which 
major interests are at stake, be involved in the Chiapas affair? 
  It would be valid to agree that this state is considered a 
third-rate producing zone, because the soil on the border is 
less suitable for such activity than that in the north. 
Nevertheless, in view of this fact, it should also be noted 
that, on the one hand, a blatant increase in poppy crops has 
been observed in the border zone between Chiapas and Guatemala; 
and, on the other, the controls established to reduce the drug 
trafficking to the United States has prompted a search for new 
routes. In other words, the fact that Chiapas is not important 
as a producer does not detract from the drug traffickers' 
interest in it as a preferred corridor for drug movement. We 
should not forget that "El Chapo" Guzman was captured in 
Guatemala. 
  The reporter, Jesus Sanchez, writing in EL FINANCIERO on the 
subject, remarks: "The official reports show concern over the 
formation of the so-called Chiapas triangle, which, by May 1993, 
was being viewed from the following standpoint: It could be 
concluded that, owing to conditions of extreme poverty and 
serious sociopolitical conflicts, a corridor may have been 
established that would create an empty zone, to be converted 
into a smokescreen concealing `narco'-terrorist activities." We 
can find a similar situation in Peru, with the SL [Shining Path] 
group, which is offering protection for the growing and movement 
of drugs. 
  The data proving the zone's importance as a transit point 
are 
interesting. During 1992, 152 aircraft presumably carrying drugs 
were detected: a figure 250 percent higher than the number of 
planes discovered in 1991. All of this discounts the increase in 
drug drops made using short flights. 
  Similarly, of the total number of flights leaving South 
America with illicit cargo, 43 percent have the Central American 
isthmus as their destination. From there, a considerable number 
reach Guatemala, and their cargo is transferred by land to 
Chiapas. This is quite obvious in the trafficking of opiates, 
the seizures of which last year accounted for 97 percent of the 
total confiscated throughout the entire country. 
  Nor should we underestimate the requirements of money 
laundering and the possibilities of diverting the attention of 
the Army and the other authorities responsible for combating the 
drug traffic, which might well be discharging this function in 
other locations. This is nothing new. Perhaps the most 
enlightening experience in this respect is reflected in the link 
between the Colombian guerrillas and drug traffickers. 
  After all, behind harsh Mexico lies the Mexico of injustice 
and infamy. Nevertheless, let us hope that this obvious truth 
does not cause us to forget other factors which, albeit 
secondary, cannot fail to disturb and aggravate the situation. 
The drug traffic is, unquestionably, one of them.

  [Excerpts] In antidrug operations conducted within the past 
24 hours, agents from the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic confiscated over three tons of marijuana, 104 kg and 
180 grams of pure cocaine, and one kg and 184 grams of heroin, 
with a total black market value exceeding 315 million new pesos. 
  Reports sent to the Federal Judicial Police Directorate, 
headed by Commander Adrian Carrera, and to the force's 
operational directorate, under Victor Patino Esquivel, indicate 
that the operations took place in nine of the federation's 
states. A total of 20 presumed drug traffickers were captured, 
and nine automotive vehicles used to transport the drugs were 
seized as well. 
  The federal detectives foiled the purchase and sale 
transaction involving 104 kg and 150 grams of pure cocaine, in 
Tamaulipas State, following the arrest of Daniel Salinas 
Villarreal, who was driving a sedan type car with state of Texas 
plates. [passage omitted] 
  The department's agency in Michoacan State reported the 
largest confiscation of cannabis indica, after the capture of 
five presumed drug dealers in the town of Tepaltepec, with one 
ton and 175 kg of that drug in their possession. The marijuana 
was located in what is known as a collection center, on Jalisco 
and Felipe Carrillo Puerto Streets. Confiscated on that site 
were seven hydraulic jacks, presses, roles of plastic adhesive, 
and automotive vehicles used to transport drugs. Manuel Ramirez 
Cortes, Manuel Ramirez Barajas, Arnoldo Cortes Magana, Arturo 
Cravez Garcia, and Carlos Cruz Ruelas, found engaged in 
compacting marijuana, were arrested. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The powerful drug cartels are attempting to convert 
some of Nicaragua's Pacific coasts, primarily at Rivas, into 
"key sites" for drug trafficking. Their aim for the short term 
is to gain the market previously monopolized by the now 
dismantled Medellin Cartel. 
  Captain Gregorio Aburto, the Rivas police chief, claimed: 
"Nicaragua is the target, and, specifically, our unprotected 
Pacific coasts." 
  In fact, there are in Rivas some nearly uninhabited coasts 
offering drug traffickers terrain suited for the unloading of 
drugs (mainly cocaine) by air and sea, without being detected by 
the police, who are faced with a budget problem for keeping 
their agents in the area. 
  Along the Rivas coast there are at least 18 inlets that 
could 
prove ideal for the entry of drugs destined for northern Central 
America. These inlets are located on isolated beaches, such as 
El Conejo, Gavilan, Popoyo, Guasacate, and others surrounded by 
mountains and hills, offering a "good hideout" for the shipments. 
  Colombia's Cali Cartel is attempting to find an "ideal 
hiding 
place" for its drug shipments in that section of Rivas, so as to 
gain ground and a market for drugs formerly monopolized by the 
Medellin Cartel. The latter drug cartel was broken up after the 
death of its top-ranking chief, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, on 2 
December of last year. 
  Evidence of the Cali Cartel's intentions was the operation 
unsuccessfully attempted by the drug traffic in Popoyo and 
Guasacate on 12 January of this year. 
  In a joint operation, the National Police and the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) succeeded in confiscating 275 
kg of cocaine out of the 300 kg that the Cali Cartel was trying 
to ship to Guatemala through Nicaraguan territory. In Guatemala, 
a subordinate organization of that cartel, called the 
"Guatemalan Connection," was to be responsible for distributing 
and selling the drugs. 
  In that action, termed "Operation Ocean," six persons were 
captured: four Guatemalans and two Nicaraguans. 
  Yesterday, the National Police Counternarcotics Division 
captured Marcelo Sanchez Mejia, the presumed chief of the 
"Guatemalan Connection," in Nicaragua. Sanchez was arrested with 
an ex-lieutenant from the Sandinist People's Army (EPS) named 
Marvin Cuadra, while both were located in Las Piedrecitas. 
  According to Captain Aburto, it was after this operation 
that 
the inference was made of the drug traffickers' intention of 
devising "a possible assault by the drug cartels for control of 
Nicaragua's Pacific area. They want that market left by the 
Medellin Cartel." 
  As Captain Aburto explained, the drug dealers have 
discovered 
that sending drugs by way of the Pacific to Guatemala is "safer" 
for them than moving them on the Atlantic. 
  The police chief reported: "Those captured in this operation 
took off from Colombia in a white Cessna plane, crossing the 
island of San Andres. Then they entered Nicaraguan territory 
through Barra del Colorado, in Rio San Juan. They crossed the 
Cocibolca and the Rivas Isthmus and, upon reaching the 
Nicaraguan Pacific, they dropped the shipment into the sea." 
  "It is untrue that they took off from Panama," explained 
Captain Aburto, correcting with his assertion certain accounts 
published in other news media. 
  The "safety" offered by the Central American Pacific is 
based 
on some "technical factors" related to air and sea 
transportation. 
  For example, on the Atlantic the drug traffickers have to 
cross larger stretches of land; whereas, on the Pacific, they 
can reach Guatemala without having to touch land first. 
  Moreover, the Pacific has not been a traditional route in 
the 
drug traffic; hence, there is little surveillance: a situation 
offering them the "best opportunity." It should be added that, 
when a small plane flies "skimming water," it is not detected by 
military radar, and its passage through each country's waters 
goes unnoticed. 
  There are two advantages that the drug traffic has found in 
the Nicaraguan Pacific: The first lies in Rivas, where there are 
secluded beaches suitable for unloading drugs; and the other is 
the geographical advantage of certain beaches farther north, 
such as La Boquita, Casares, and Huehuete. 
  At these three bathing resorts there are connecting roads 
leading to different parts of the country, so that the "narcos" 
need not pass through police checkpoints. 
  For example, from Casares one can depart for San Rafael del 
Sur along a road that crosses the locality of San Pablo. It is 
also possible to leave Leon using the Carretera Vieja [Old 
Highway], going through Villa El Carmen. Finally, one can reach 
Diriamba and, from there, travel as far as El Crucero, Managua. 
All these roads offer great opportunities. 
  On a lesser scale, some small drug trafficking groups that 
have been reorganizing since the "downfall" of the Medellin 
Cartel deal in small amounts of drugs that they bring in through 
"blind spots" on Nicaragua's southern border. 
  They use the so-called "pack mules," who are persons hired 
to 
carry from one to three kg of cocaine concealed in special 
compartments of their knapsacks. 
  Another problem faced by the Rivas police is the marijuana 
growing in sections bordering Costa Rica. Captain Aburto claimed 
that some "Ticos" [Costa Ricans] are using our border land to 
grow that drug. 
  The Colon, Zapotillo, and Sardinas sections are the ones 
most 
involved. At the beginning of this year, 14,000 marijuana plants 
were discovered and destroyed in Colon.

<F P=106> [Article by Mauricio Schvartzman entitled "Computer </F>
Problems"] 
  [Text] It is said that a former president of a small and 
poor country travelled to the United States last December. 
Arriving in Miami, an immigration department agent--after 
looking through the passenger's passport and consulting the 
computer--asked him to wait, ordered a [member of] customs 
personnel to bring his suitcases and invited him to a nearby 
office. The visitor, somewhat alarmed, asked: "What is wrong?" 
The customs official explained: "Your name coincides with that 
of another person who appears on the screen. Moreover, he is 
your age--the customs official complicated matters even more 
so--and he is registered as a drug trafficker." The foreign 
visitor indignant, surprised, and desperate protested: "That 
cannot be." He complained: "I was president of the republic and 
fought drug trafficking with the U.S. Government's cooperation. 
Let me phone the U.S. ambassador in my country." 
  The former president managed to get through: "Ambassador, I 
am being delayed here in Miami because the computer registers a 
drug trafficker with my name." He explained his problem 
sounding rather terrified. The ambassador confirms: "Yes, they 
have informed me that your name appears in the computer. It is 
a computer problem." The ambassador promises to do his best, 
saying: "We will resolve the problem." 
  It is said that finally after 40 minutes, or after some 90 
minutes according to more exaggerated witness reports, the 
former president was able to comply with the immigration red 
tape and visit the United States under the uneasy impression 
that the incident, caused by who knows what, was a warning. 
  This anecdote is an example of the political language of 
"demonstrations," like military maneuvers, street 
demonstrations, cabinet changes, retirements, etc., whose 
goals--which exceed their disclosed purposes--are uncovered, 
sometimes correctly and others erroneously, through analysis or 
speculation. 
  The case of the former president delayed by an immigration 
agent reminds us of the unfulfilled promises General Andres 
Rodriguez--who perfectly fits the anti-hero in the 
anecdote--made to the U.S. Government about handing over the 
protectors of drug trafficking and dismantling their 
infrastructure. 
  If for the political process the transition meant building 
the legal framework of democracy to assure the free action of 
the political institutions and elect--based on these 
conditions--the first civilian president, for the U.S. 
Government it also meant eliminating the protection system for 
drug traffickers. 
  The United States was especially concerned about this 
because 
the transition process was begun by a totally corrupt Armed 
Forces whose rebellious commander presided over the executive 
branch. The proposal to "dignify" the Armed Forces by the 
rebels was not restricted merely, under the terms of the U.S. 
aid for the new government, to prohibiting military men from 
engaging in partisan activities, eradicating illegal activities 
in general, and controlling the misuse and draining of state 
resources, but specifically to the handing over of those who 
protect traffickers. 
  The concern was and is very logical. U.S. experts wonder if 
military men are capable of dignifying the Armed Forces. Who 
will cast the first stone? Who is clean enough of any charges, 
of any links, or of protecting anyone to cast the first stone? 
More than four years of transition government have elapsed and 
the strategists received the expected answer: The process to 
dignify the Armed Forces failed--we have the disastrous example 
of Colonel Gonzalez Rojas, or the replacement of General Bernal 
who at the time was defense minister, or the dismantling of the 
Antinarcotics Secretariat's leadership which greatly upset the 
United States; Rodriguez was supposed to have cast the first 
stone, but did not, he never did; and, finally, most of the 
members of the high command were and are trapped by links 
related to commitments and protection. 
  The responsibility for throwing the great quantity of stones 
that should have been cast was transferred to [President Juan 
Carlos] Wasmosy. Yes, to a civilian government, but under the 
vertical domain regarding military issues of a very ambitious 
general. The situation remains unchanged: The process to 
dignify the Armed Forces continues in the hands of the Armed 
Forces, but the difference is that it now has the ludicrous 
facade of a civilian government. 
  So, in view of the careful protection granted from high 
spheres to traffickers--detected and monitored by U.S. 
intelligence--it was decided to materialize a plan under which 
U.S. Southern Command servicemen based in Panama would build 
schools, water wells, health posts, and repair roads in San 
Pedro Department as "training for the shipment of construction 
material for future actions similar to the Persian Gulf War," as 
Ambassador Glassman explained on one occasion. Who says this 
project has concealed objectives? The message is clear and 
direct: One typical "demonstration" that the U.S. troops 
sometime use, when justified, is to carry out a "Persian 
Gulf-type" intervention in Paraguayan territory. 
  Everyone understood the message of the "demonstration" of 
the 
military social actions. The less discreet commented that 
"there are concealed purposes," without understanding the 
opportuneness of the maneuver. 
  "There are no concealed purposes and it will benefit the 
country," commented others with a sense of opportuneness, thus 
supporting the opportunity to pressure the protectors and 
allowing the Armed Forces to become dignified and overcome the 
dispute the opposition maintains with the ambitious general. 
For the first time most opposition legislators applauded the 
arrival of U.S. troops and were willing to grant them all the 
privileges and immunity requested, because they have interpreted 
the "demonstration." 
  Undoubtedly some ambitious general assumed the role of 
protector, took it personally, and overcame Wasmosy's first 
impression that the South Command's offer was beneficial. So, 
on Wednesday, 2 February, a letter of conditions was sent to 
Ambassador Glassman, which he was made to sign. According to 
the letter, the Paraguayan Army was to participate in the joint 
actions, that the cost of the project had to be clearly 
established--Congress having approved the project it should be 
noted that this plan affects the nation's sovereign rights--the 
operation zones must be restricted, the importation of weapons 
restricted, detailed information of the U.S. personnel to enter 
the country should be disclosed, and that it should be clearly 
established whom will be granted privileges and immunity. 
Wasmosy and his subordinates have again picked up the old 
yankee anti-imperialist wave. 
  This never crossed Southern Command's mind. Glassman, taken 
aback by the offense, commented that "similar offers to other 
Latin American countries were never rejected." General Oviedo, 
as a champion of the national liberation, on Thursday, 3 
February, asked journalists: "Do you think we would reject 
something that benefits the Armed Forces?" Military strategists 
read between lines: "The interests of the protectors?" The 
almost dramatic answer was: "We have withdrawn the draft bill, 
but beware the consequences." Watch out. 
  That same evening a cable television channel showed a 
documentary on U.S. military operations in Panama when Noriega 
was arrested. Was that mere coincidence or another 
"demonstration?" 
  One can expect anything if this relationship between the 
United States and the military leadership continues to be simply 
horrible. What other names and prospects will appear on the 
computer screens in the future?

<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez, of the Investigative Unit; first of </F>
a series on "the drug trafficking families"] 
  [Text] Intelligence reports from the National Police 
Antidrug Division note that of the 13 Chavez Penaherrera 
brothers and sisters, five have leading roles within the group 
led by their brother Demetrio, who is also known as "Loco 
Limonier." 
  The Army has similar information incriminating the Chavez 
Penaherrera brothers and sisters in the illegal trafficking of 
drugs. 
  Following a painstaking investigation conducted in the Upper 
Huallaga region in November 1991, an undercover agent named 
"Chaname" pointed out in his report No. 016-91 that in 
Campanilla, the main operations center of "Vaticano," the latter 
"is openly engaged in drug trafficking and is not intimidated by 
the presence of the FFOO (security forces) as he allegedly acts 
`in collusion' with them." The report further states that he is 
not in this business by himself "(but rather) in partnership 
with his brothers and sisters." 
  Second in importance to "Vaticano" is Jose Humberto, alias 
"Calavera" or "Colombo," born in Saposoa on 18 March 1951, a 
tropical music fan and director of the "Caribe Show" band. 
  According to police reports, "Calavera" has been in charge 
of 
the shipments of cocaine paste--which according to police 
estimates totalled 96,000 kg last year--since his brother 
Demetrio fled the country in 1992 to settle in Cali under the 
protection of his bosses Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. 
  "Calavera" was also in charge of managing drug processing 
laboratories and landing strips built by the drug mafia, 
especially that of Campanilla. 
  This village, located in the San Martin region where drug 
traffickers named "Cocinero," "Wicho Perez," "Negro Coco," 
"Nacional," "Azul," "Max," "Chirapo," and "Gustavo" worked for 
Demetrio Chavez, was raided by the police on 24 July 1990. 
During that operation 350 kg of cocaine paste, weapons, and 
communications systems were seized. 
  But the coca industry continued to prosper on account of the 
"arrangements with the forces of order" referred to by 
"Chaname," the Army intelligence agent. This information was 
confirmed by another officer, commander "Alfonso," 
political-military chief of Tocache in 1992. 
  In his "Intelligence Note" No. 32-S2-BCS26 "Alfonso" 
recounted "the illegal activities carried out by 
countersubversive base No. 30 stationed in the town of 
Campanilla." 
  "Alfonso" was precise: "It has been verified that the 
Peruvian Army men (from the countersubversive base) live in 
collusion with drug traffickers, especially with the `Limonel' 
firm. They dedicate themselves to sending airplanes full of 
coca paste to Colombia." 
  With such agreement, "Vaticano" could do what he wanted. It 
is even said that on 17 January 1991 a Colombian Air Force plane 
landed in Campanilla and loaded 3 tons of cocaine paste and that 
Demetrio and his brother "Calavera" personally supervised the 
operation without being bothered by anyone. 
  In April 1992, combined Army, National Police forces, and 
U.S. DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] members, again 
entered Campanilla. This time they confiscated 281 kg of cocaine 
paste--worth approximately $3 million--and arrested Victor Perez 
Pinedo, Luis Perez Aguilar, Esteiter Caballero Fernandez, and 
Rusbar Carbajal Gonzalez, who confessed they worked for 
"Vaticano" and acknowledged that "Calavera" was his right hand. 
  An Army officer who participated in the operation told "LA 
REPUBLICA" that "if it had not been for a leak, we would have 
captured `Vaticano.' Unfortunately there was a well paid 
informer among the people who participated in the operation." 
<H5>  Faithful Until the End </H5>
  After this operation Demetrio Chavez fled to Colombia and 
left the administration of the business to his brother Jose 
Humberto. 
  "Calavera" or "Colombo" also participated in the murder of 
Adolfo Isuiza Urquia, a journalist from the radio stations 
"Superior" in Juanjui and "Tropical" in Tarapoto. 
  In one of his last programs, on 17 July 1992, the brave 
journalist who denounced the scheme between the security forces 
and the "firm" of "Vaticano" said: "The famous `Vaticano' and 
his brother Jose Humberto do not want a centimeter of the 
landing strip they have in Campanilla District to be touched." 
[no closing quotation marks as published] 
  A few weeks later, on 23 August 1993, Isuiza was murdered by 
"Chacal" and "Lagartija," two hired killers who were also 
eliminated by order of Demetrio Limonier so as not to leave any 
evidence of his connection to the disappearance of the 
journalist. 
  On 4 December 1993 the combined forces of the National 
Police 
and the DEA again entered Campanilla and on this occasion they 
caught "Calavera" red-handed in a cocaine paste processing 
laboratory. 
  Although he attempted to escape from his captors as soon as 
he saw them arriving in a helicopter, he is now imprisoned in 
Juanjui. 
  Nearly a year earlier, on 7 January 1993, the police 
detected 
that, by order of "Vaticano," a stretch of the marginal highway 
was being repaired very near Campanilla, in Balsayacu, to turn 
it into a clandestine landing strip. The repairs were being 
supervised by none other than "Calavera." 
  Jose Humberto Chavez Penaherrera was one of the names 
mentioned by Colombian Manuel Guillermo Cruz Ayala, arrested on 
23 March 1993 during a police operation that ended with the 
destruction of a laboratory and a landing strip in the town of 
Nueva Jerusalen del Erene, Caballococha Province, near the 
Colombian border. 
  Cruz Ayala also mentioned "Vaticano" and Bertha Chavez 
Penaherrera, alias "La Calena" or "Perla Fina" arrested by the 
Antidrug Division on 24 September 1993 in her home in Surco, 
Lima. 
  At the moment of her arrest "La Calena," who was born on 30 
July 1959 in Saposoa, was accompanied by her lover Marco Ivan 
Luna Victoria Rivera, 26, summoned by El Callao Supreme Court 
for illegal drug trafficking. 
  Luna Victoria Rivera, a member of the gang of Julio Cesar 
Rodriguez Hurtado, is at large. Rodriguez Hurtado was turned in 
by Belgian citizen Michel Depoorter Decroos who was arrested in 
March 1990 at the Jorge Chavez International Airport with 10 kg 
of pure cocaine, "merchandise" he intended to transport to 
Luxembourg. 
<H5>  The Contact </H5>
  Since then, Luna Victoria Rivera has been wanted by the 
police but "La Calena" has told "LA REPUBLICA" that she did not 
know he was wanted by justice. 
  "He never told me that," she said. 
  But that was not the only amorous relationship she had with 
people linked with the drug trafficking business. According to 
the Dirandro [Antidrug Division] she also lived with Colombian 
citizen Jorge Rodriguez, a drug trafficker with whom she had two 
sons and who died as consequence of a vendetta in Cali in 1980. 
  Personal documents belonging to "Vaticano" were also found 
in 
the home of Bertha Chavez Penaherrera. These documents include 
his voting document, his birth certificate, and a false penal 
certificate in which he appears clean from any police record. 
  "La Calena" told our newspaper that she has not seen her 
brother Demetrio Limonier for 10 years and Jose Humberto for 
eight years and that a stranger had left "Vaticano's" documents 
in her house although she refused to receive them. 
  In the same Dirandro report of March 1993, Bertha Chavez is 
linked with the activities of her brother Demetrio. 
  Army sources state that she "moved nearly 500 kg of cocaine 
base every 15 days, taking the drug from one place to another, 
but within the same zone, in an operation which drug traffickers 
call `disorientation'" [trasteo]. 
  According to the same information obtained in the Upper 
Huallaga region, Saposoa was the operations center of "La 
Calena" who competed in the area with drug trafficker "Lucho 
Culon," of Cajamarca, "Nino" and "Clavo," of Pucallpa, and 
"Tolima," "Azul," and "Leo," of Colombia. 
  In a paid ad published only a few weeks ago in some Lima 
newspapers, Bertha Chavez denied any link with the drug 
trafficking business and maintained that the Dirandro had forged 
this lie about her by inventing information linking her with 
"Vaticano." 
  She said that if she were wanted by justice "I would present 
myself immediately" but "La Calena" has left Lima and her family 
will not provide any information about her current whereabouts. 
  Bertha Chavez, who upon being arrested was transferred to 
the 
Iquitos prison because she had been summoned by the court of 
Maynas, was released on 26 November 1993. Prosecutor Teresa 
Porras Carrion and Maynas Provincial Judge Jaime Cardenas 
Fonseca agreed that the testimony of Colombian citizen Cruz 
Ayala was "not enough evidence" to keep her under arrest, so she 
was released. 
  But the documents that were found with her provided the 
police with more details about the movements of "Vaticano" who 
was preparing his Colombian naturalization. 
  Another piece of information that compromises "La Calena" is 
the testimony of "Juan Pablo," an Army major who carried out 
antidrug operations in the Upper Huallaga region in 1992. 
  According to "Juan Pablo," she came to his house in Lima and 
invited him to go to a restaurant in Costa Verde for a drink. 
There, Bertha Chavez Penaherrera offered: "To move the 
helicopter (he was responsible for) and money to protect 
Campanilla. She told me: `Do not touch Campanilla and we will 
give you a monthly payment.'" 
  The officer's testimony was passed to U.S. Embassy officials 
in Lima who in turn reported it to U.S. Assistant Secretary for 
Inter-American Affairs Alexander Watson, who is visiting Peru on 
a special mission. 
  Another sister of Demetrio is Bersabe, born on 7 November 
1956, also in Saposoa, San Martin, and also a member of his drug 
trafficking gang. 
  According to police sources, she was the link between the 
coca producing zones and Lima, where she carried out financial 
duties and purchased chemical components to manufacture cocaine 
paste. 
  When asked about her sister "La Calena" she said that "she 
always visits me" and that she had told her that their brother 
"Calavera" owns "a cattle ranch and a musical band." 
  On that occasion Bertha had told "LA REPUBLICA" that 
"Vaticano" is the fourth of 13 brothers and sisters and that he 
had left home when he was 14 years old. 
  Another member of the family is Elias Chavez Penaherrera 
also 
identified as a member of the gang by the Antidrug Division. 
  Elias uses the alias "Lan Chile" and is in charge of 
stocking 
cocaine base balls. He is currently at large. 
  The Dirandro has also established that another Chavez 
Penaherrera known as "Fierro" is involved in his brother's 
organization. 
  U.S. Embassy antinarcotics officials have told LA REPUBLICA 
that they have information about the Chavez Penaherrera family's 
network but they refuse to give any details in order to 
guarantee the investigations carried out in coordination with 
the Dirandro. 
  The Chavez Penaherrera family, like many other Andean 
immigrants, was one of the first to settle in Saposoa. 
  The parents, Juan Pablo Chavez Vargas and Rosa Penaherrera 
Izquierdo, began as modest farmers and cattle raisers on a small 
plot of land. 
  Only a few of their children dedicated themselves to cattle 
raising and agriculture. Faced with the flourishing drug 
business, Demetrio Limonier, Jose Humberto, Bertha, Bersabe, 
Elias, and the "Fierro" preferred, according to the 
antinarcotics forces, to organize the most powerful drug 
trafficking gang. 
  There are still some other organizations run by families, 
like that of Waldo Simeon Vargas Arias, alias "El Ministro" and 
that of Abelardo Cachique Rivera, both as important as that of 
"Vaticano" and still untouchable.

<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez] </F>
  [Text] The "Cachique Rivera Clan" is a drug trafficking 
gang that is still free and continues to manufacture cocaine in 
Augaytia and in the Pozuzo Valley under the orders of the Cali 
Cartel. 
  None of its members have ever been arrested although the 
police have conducted several operations against it, both in the 
coca producing areas and in Lima where five stylish houses were 
searched in San Borja and La Molina. 
  The Cachique Rivera brothers, from Huanuco, is another 
family 
involved in large-scale trafficking. The Cachique Rivera family 
is perhaps the only drug gang authorized by the Cali Cartel to 
produce cocaine hydrochloride in Peru. 
  The Cachique Rivera family, originally residents of Rupa 
Rupa, Leoncio Prado Province, Huanuco Department, mainly conduct 
their operations in the Pozuzo Valley, a jungle area in Pasco. 
They work from a big abandoned ranch that has a secret landing 
strip. They also operate in Aguaytia, Padre Abad Province, 
Ucayali Department. 
  Cocaine production is a task carried out exclusively by 
Colombians in their country, but the Cachique Riveras have 
achieved such an important organizational level that the Cali 
Cartel heads have allowed them a biweekly production of between 
400 and 500 kg of cocaine. 
  Chemists from Colombia, trained by their Peruvian employers, 
are in charge of transforming the cocaine paste into cocaine. 
  In November 1991, the Cachique Rivera family received a 
harsh 
blow from the antidrug forces when their laboratory in Boca de 
Santa Ana, Ycayali, was destroyed and 250 kg of cocaine 
hydrochloride was seized. 
  About 100 kg of this seizure was "lost" in the offices of 
the 
Executive Agency for Drug Control, Ofecod. This scandal was not 
investigated and remains unpunished. 
  The Cachique Rivera family organization system is highly 
effective because none of its members were arrested during the 
police operation. Two years later they again evaded the 
security forces. 
  On 5 February 1993, the DEA invaded the Cachique Rivera 
hideout in Aguaytia and found a well-equipped laboratory, a 
sophisticated arsenal comprising UZI submachine guns, Remington 
repeater rifles, Star and Browning rifles, AKM rifles, hand 
grenades, and a highly-sophisticated communication system, 
including an Icon transceiver and Yaesu equipment. 
  Moreover, the antidrug force found 25 gallons of 100-LL type 
gasoline for small planes. 
  Three days later, and as a result of the questioning of 
those 
arrested in the operation--Marina Saavedra Ramirez, Augusto 
Figueroa Garcia and Alicia Egoavil Grandez--the police broke 
into the Cachique Rivera laboratory in Carachama, Aguaytia, on 
the Yurac River. 
  The antidrug force found 48 large containers of chemicals 
used in the manufacturing of drugs; 16 gallons of ammonia; 50 kg 
of potassium permanganate; 16 hammocks used in the drying of the 
cocaine paste; 10 zinc sheets; high-precision scales; six 
microwave ovens; a dozen generators, and even a beacon [faro]. 
  The quality of the infrastructure, which included electric 
water pumps, 50 primus stoves, metal sieves, and staples to feed 
two dozen people for three months, show the volume of the gang's 
production. 
  The Dinandro [Antidrug Division] again gave another blow to 
the Cachique Rivera family on 28 April 1993, but this time it 
was in Lima. 
  The antidrug police raided five stylish houses owned by the 
Cachique Rivera brothers. Two are located in the La Encantada 
and La Campina urban developments in Chorrillos; two on Breton 
and Tiziano Streets in San Borja; and one on Vina del Mar Street 
in the El Sol de La Molina urbanization development. They were 
valued at $500,000. 
  Other members of the gang were identified during these raids 
but they are still at large. They are: Armando Rivera Tanga, 
Maria Sanchez Rios, Isminia Espinoza Ascencia, Adrian Condor 
Meza and Gladys Escalante Aguilar. 
  Dinandro and the DEA office have reported that the chief of 
the trafficking gang is Abelardo Cachique Rivera, alias 
"Teniente" or "Negro." He was born on 20 September 1959 in 
Bagua Grande, Amazonas. 
  His second in command is Segundo Gaudencio, alias "Capitan" 
or "Guno." He was born on 3 December 1957, in Rupa Rupa, 
Leoncio Prado, Huanuco. 
  The police have also identified Adolfo, alias "Alferez," who 
was born on 20 November 1961; Nicolas, alias "Mayor," born on 30 
November 1953; Margarita, no known alias, born on 7 May 1964; 
all of whom were born in Rupa Rupa. 
  Also identified in the Dinandro files but reported as "at 
large" is the father of the clan, Gaudencio Cachique Rivera, 57 
years old, born in Lamas, San Martin. 
  A high-ranking Dinandro official said: "Cachique Rivera is a 
very well organized family gang that receives a very special 
treatment from the Cali Cartel. They produce cocaine 
hydrochloride in large quantities. They have been identified." 
  A well-informed U.S. Embassy source connected to the 
antidrug 
operation said he is aware of the activities of the Cacique 
Rivera brothers and described them as "an important trafficking 
gang that operates in Peru." 
  With the arrest of [Drug Kingpin] "Vaticano," and the damage 
to his organization with his arrest, the so-called "Cachique 
Rivera gang" has now gained a new level of importance. 
  The U.S. Embassy source said: "This gang moves a great deal 
of drugs because they are cocaine manufacturers and hoarders." 
  The Dinandro office reports that in addition to 
"manufacturing" 1,000 kg of cocaine per month, the Cachique 
Rivera gang also "exports" 20 metric tonnes of cocaine paste per 
month to Colombia. 
  The members of the Cachique Rivera gang are being sought by 
the 7th Correctional Court and by the 13th Lima Instruction 
Court on charges of drug trafficking. They will most likely be 
sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  Abelardo Caccique, alias "Teniente" or "Negro" frequently 
travels to Colombia to report on the gang's activities to its 
Cali Cartel chiefs. 
  A Dinandro officer said: "This gang is one of our immediate 
objectives. It is only a matter of time. We are working on it."

<F P=106> [Article by Perla Baca] </F>
  [Text] The Huallaga Valley, which is located in San Martin 
in the northern Peruvian jungle, is a rich farming area that 
produces fine crops of cotton, jute fiber, palm oil, coffee, 
rice, corn, and fruits. It also has outstanding forest and river 
resources, wildlife, and nonmetallic mineral deposits. 
  It is also a very beautiful valley: beautiful lagoons, 
waterfalls, and thermal water springs. Its cultural and 
archaeological past is also outstanding, as is shown by the 
ruins of the fortress of Gran Patajen and Pucullo, which can be 
used as well for promoting tourism. 
  At the international level, however, the Upper Huallaga 
Valley is not known for these beauties but, unfortunately, 
because it is known as the place that produces 60 percent of the 
coca leaves used for preparing cocaine paste and cocaine 
hydrochloride, that is, two of the narcotics that have more 
seriously damaged mankind, especially U.S. and European 
societies. 
  This paradoxical situation has brought to the once peaceful, 
beautiful, and backward, but rich, Huallaga area the repugnant 
and growing criminal activity of international and domestic drug 
traffickers. 
  The area was flooded with dollars, violence, and corruption, 
becoming the "paradise of drug trafficking." The population, 
which grew because of increasing migration, became the active or 
passive accomplice to drug trafficking. 
  International drug traffickers for years engaged in the 
trade 
of illegal drugs uninterrupted, without any major problems and 
even with some security, until the current government sent a 
signal that it had the clear intention of forcefully confronting 
drug trafficking in the area. 
<H5>  Resolute Action by the State </H5>
  In 1992, after realizing that it was practically impossible 
to control such a big area by land with such irregular 
topographic features, the government of President Alberto 
Fujimori, through Decree-Law No. 25426 promulgated on 6 April, 
ordered the Peruvian Air Force [FAP] to take direct control of 
airports and airstrips in northeastern Peru, which accounts for 
almost one-fourth of the national territory. 
  After intense work for establishing the strategy and 
logistical support, the FAP assumed this responsibility. On 13 
June, FAP took control of the airport of Uchiza, a small town in 
the middle of our big jungle, from which an average of 20 small 
planes took off every week carrying drugs for the Colombian and 
U.S. "cartels" and Peruvian "firms." 
  This airport was followed by 13 other airports and 
airstrips. 
Several illegal airstrips also were closed, and more than $2 
million was confiscated along with thousands of kilograms of 
drugs. 
  At first, FAP's intervention was not expected to yield 
favorable results, on the grounds that corruption would end up 
buying "the Blue Ones" (this is how FAP members have been 
christened in the area). But this was wrong. The tidiness, 
morality, and devotion of FAP members are obvious in each one of 
their actions in the area. In addition, the strategy and 
intelligence adopted in the area have succeeded. 
<H5>  From 100 to 0 Flights With Drugs </H5>
  The results, after almost two years of FAP control, are 
obvious: 
  At the 14 airports and airstrips controlled by FAP, not a 
single drug traffickers' light plane has taken off carrying 
drugs. Planes usually loaded an average of 600 kg drugs and 
brought precursors for the production of drug. 
  The success reached its crowning point during the first 20 
days of April 1993, in which the Yurimaguas radar and U.S. AWACS 
and Orion planes did not detect a single drug traffickers' small 
plane in Huallaga airspace searching for an illegal airstrip for 
landing. 
  It should be noted that there are some 200 airstrips in this 
jungle area, of which approximately 70 are illegal. 
  During the first months of 1992 it was estimated that drug 
traffickers' aircraft made between 70 to 100 flights per month 
in the area. This average has been reduced to almost zero in 
the airports and airstrips controlled by the FAP; however, there 
are still "mules" who transport a few kilos of drugs concealed 
in their own cargo. Currently, drug traffickers' aircraft 
cunningly fly toward clandestine airstrips. 
  FAP patrolling or surveillance of the Upper Huallaga has 
forced the narcos to change their flight routes. 
  The Apurimac Valley (Palmapampa-Ayacucho) has now become the 
drug traffickers' cocaine PBC [cocaine base paste] stocking 
center. 
  In light of this, FAP took control of Palmapampa last 
November, and the Democratic Constituent Congress stepped up the 
antidrug struggle by granting the Armed Forces the authority to 
pursue and arrest drug traffickers in areas where there are no 
police stations. This law--No. 26247--was published by EL 
PERUANO on 25 November. This law gives FAP the authority to 
arrest drug traffickers, something it did not do in the past 
because that was not its duty. In the past FAP was only in 
charge of preventing air space violations and directly 
controlling area airports and airstrips. 
  Another achievement is that the air taxi services of 
airlines 
legally operating in the area have reduced their tariffs because 
they no longer have to pay "protection fees." 
  Moreover, the locals have confidence in FAP officials. FAP 
has created a youth organization called "Los Aguilucho" 
[Eaglets] that consists of clubs devoted to sports and civic and 
patriotic teachings offered by a dozen officers to some 1,400 
children and youths. 
  It should be noted, however, that the strict control of 
airports has brought poverty to the region because the 
substantial reduction of the drug trade has cut the flow of 
dollars to the region. 
  Area peasants have repeatedly stated, even at Government 
House: "We want alternative development in a rich agricultural 
area. We want to devote our work to legal and profitable crops 
but we need help." Uncertainty currently distresses the 
region's people. 
  The control exercised by FAP also has caused the drug 
trafficker mafias to resort to more sophisticated technology and 
methods. 
  The drug traffickers now have more modern and faster 
aircraft 
than the Tucano aircraft used by FAP to fight drug trafficking. 
  Moreover, the drug traffickers seem to be hiring more 
skillful pilots capable of skimming the tops of the forest trees 
to avoid being spotted; they fly zig-zag along the rivers and 
leave in groups of three in different directions to avoid being 
intercepted. At night they also light up three or four 
airstrips at a time in various points of Huallaga to confuse FAP. 
  Besides, FAP pilots do not have radars in their aircraft. 
They depend on information supplied by U.S. air and land 
radars. This hinders their autonomy and the speed with which 
they intercept the drug traffickers. The Tucano pilots use 
night vision systems at night. 
  Experts on antidrug operations have commented that never 
before in Peru has such important progress been made in the 
interdiction of drug trafficking, despite the fact that the 
struggle is carried out with a deficient infrastructure and a 
meager budget. The tents in which FAP personnel live in the 
area are proof of this. 
  Uncertainty has spread among the drug traffickers in the 
Upper Huallaga. Even more so with the recent arrest of the 
greatest drug trafficker Peru has ever had; Demetrio Limonier 
Chavez Penaherrera, aka Vaticano. 
  The coordinated action of all the security forces, that is, 
the Army, Navy, Air Force, police, and DEA, is beginning to 
yield results in the Upper Huallaga. 
  Drug traffickers are extremely nervous. They no longer enjoy 
the influence they did in the past. During the past few months 
many drug traffickers have ended as they started: in misery. 
  The new anti-narcotics strategy in the area is proving 
fruitful. Consequently, drug traffickers are trying to use new, 
uncertain routes still not controlled properly. 
  Coca is currently planted and harvested in La Mar 
(Ayacucho), 
Andahuaylas (Apurimac) and La Convencion (Cusco) Provinces. 
<H5>  The New Map of Drug Trafficking in Peru </H5>
  The drug traffickers' "firms" operated like any enterprise 
but clandestinely; they finance the purchase in bulk of drugs 
(stock), they make cocaine base paste, and act as bridges for 
the Colombian cartels. Their hierarchy structure is vertical, 
ranging from the "patron" [boss] or "duro" [strongman] to the 
"burro" [mule] or "traquetero" [middleman]. These firms finance 
the maintenance of the clandestine airstrips. 
  Currently, about 50 "firms" operate in the Upper Huallaga. 
"Vaticano," who was arrested by Colombian police as a result of 
a coordinated effort with the national intelligence service, 
according to President Alberto Fujimori, is regarded as the most 
powerful drug trafficker Peru has ever had. His organization 
traded approximately $900 million per year with the Cali cartel 
in Colombia. Now Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera is behind 
bars in a Lima prison. 
  Vaticano operated in Uchiza until last year but had to leave 
when FAP arrived. He then went to Campanilla and then to 
Bellavista... but also had to leave when "the Blue Ones" 
arrived. Vaticano then built a clandestine airstrip in Barranca. 
  Another achievement is the blockade with concrete blocks of 
the clandestine airstrips and part of the coastal and Federio 
Basadre highways--the area's main highways. The drug 
traffickers used the straight portions of these highways as 
clandestine landing strips. 
  This has caused drug trafficking to shift toward the 
Aguaytia 
Valley, Pichis-Palcazu, Jaen-Bagua, and the Apurimac Valley 
(Palmapampa-Ayacucho). Drug traffickers' aircraft now enter 
Peruvian airspace through the Amazon Trapezium (Leticia, 
Caballococha, Tabatinga) and the Brazilian jungle on the border 
with Ucayali in order to avoid being intercepted by FAP aircraft 
and to dodge the Yurimaguas radar. 
  At least another two radars are necessary due to the new 
coca 
map in Peru and its extremely uneven geography.

  [Text] Police have reported that Demetrio Limoniel Chavez 
Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano" or "Loco Limoniel," has had direct 
contact with "Artemio" and "Clay," who are, respectively, the 
political and military chiefs of the Shining Path's Huallaga 
Regional Committee and were members of the terrorist 
organization's national board. Both Artemio and Clay were close 
to Abimael Guzman Reynoso, aka "Gonzalo." 
  Even though "Vaticano" gave the Shining Path thousands of 
dollars as "quota" or "contributions," the drug trafficker said 
he was not the only one to do so, adding that there are other 
"firms" (organizations of "drug traffickers") who have done the 
same and are still paying large amounts of money. 
  Among the firms are the groups led by "El Ministro," "Lucho 
Culon," "Cholo Claudio," and "Cachiques." 
  During a news conference at Dincote facilities on 27 
January, 
it was reported that "Vaticano" was practically the "king" of 
Uchiza in 1988 and 1989. 
  After that he moved to Campanilla, Mariscal Caceres Province 
(San Martin), where among other things he repaired a stretch of 
the Marginal Highway to use it as an airstrip. 
<H5>  Services to Other `Firms' </H5>
  This was the point of departure for not only his small 
planes, but he also used the airstrip to render services to 
other "firms," with the protection and security granted by the 
Shining Path, which was paid $5,000 per flight plus $3 per 
kilogram of basic coca paste or $6 per kilogram of washed coca 
paste. 
  Furthermore, Vaticano has supplied terrorists with war arms 
(FAL and AKM rifles, submachine guns, pistols, etc.), 
transportation services, military outfits, communications 
equipment, food, medicine, and information on the activities of 
the forces of order. 
  Repented terrorists identified by codes AIA-000083, 
AIA-000092, AIJ-O55461, and AIJ-O55463 have confirmed this 
information, positively identifying "Vaticano" as the person who 
gave money to "Artemio" and "Clay," and to other terrorist 
leaders known as "Mancini," "James," and "Liborio," whom he used 
as liaison for paying "quotas" or contributions. 
  Dincote sources said "Vaticano" has admitted before the 
special military prosecutor that he is a "narcoterrorist" and 
that when he had his operations center in Uchiza and Campanilla, 
he supplied the Shining Path with medicine, food, clothes, 
transportation, etc. 
  But he did not admit that he supplied firearms, ammunition, 
and explosives. 
  It should be noted that along with "Vaticano," Dincote also 
has pressed high treason charges against Shining Path chiefs 
"Artemio" and "Clay," who were charged "in absentia." 
<H5>  Narcoterrorism Uncovered </H5>
  Dincote sources said this is the first time police have 
arrested a drug trafficker of "Vaticano's" level who has 
cooperated with terrorism, thus confirming the existence of the 
so-called "narcoterrorism." 
  "In the past, references were made only to the union of 
terrorism and drug trafficking. Countless documents hinting at 
it were found but there was no direct evidence. Now we have it," 
the sources said. 
  One of the major documents shown at the 27 January news 
conference is the "Economic Balance of the Shining Path, 
produced by the `quotas' of (TID) [illegal drug trafficking] 
firms," which Dincote seized on 23 August 1993 in the village of 
Anda (Tingo Maria). 
  The balance book has detailed information on daily 
operations 
with income and expenses. It also clearly shows that they 
charged $3,000 to $7,000 per flight by small planes. 
  The balance book, which is dated March 1991, mentions 
"Limoniel" as a debtor for flights that were already made.

  [Text] Some 600 tons of washed cocaine paste, the 
preliminary step to conversion into cocaine hydrochloride, were 
produced in Peru's coca-growing areas in 1993, according to a 
confidential report released by the Antinarcotics Intelligence 
Division of the National Police. 
  The efforts of law enforcement agencies in prohibiting or 
fighting production of the drug resulted in seizures amounting 
to less than 1 percent of the total produced, the document 
states. 
  Peruvian drug traffickers used some 2.134 million kilos of 
raw cocaine paste [PBC] and substantial volumes of chemical 
ingredients to produce that quantity of washed PBC. 
  The source reports that logistical and financial support 
extended to law enforcement agencies in their fight against 
illegal trafficking in Alto Huallaga and the various rain basins 
of the Peruvian central mountains and jungle was inadequate. 
  In addition, the American Government has cut its funding of 
the fight against the scourge. 
  The American State Department recently ordered the transfer 
of UH-1H and Bell 212 helicopters from the Santa Lucia antidrug 
base (in the heart of Central Huallaga) to the Pucallpa Air Base 
as part of its economic measures. 
  Nevertheless, our sources have reported that since the 
transfer about a month ago, the aircraft have not been sent out 
on antidrug operations for even five minutes! 
  When the helicopters were based at Santa Lucia, they were 
used in daily police interdiction operations. 
  One fact resulting in increased PBC production is that the 
peasants who grow coca for leaves now also produce raw PBC. 
  "The peasants plant and harvest coca leaves, dry them on 
their roofs, then crush them and produce from 2 to 3 kilos of 
raw PBC. They take it to collection centers indicated by the 
Peruvian drug traffickers, whence it is sent to Colombia," the 
spokesman said. 
  There are various means of shipping the drug to Colombia, 
where it is refined in underground laboratories. 
  Small planes (twin-engine aircraft that can carry up to 2 
tons in a single trip) and boats are used. Very little is hauled 
overland due to poor roads and police control. 
  Coca growing and the production of cocaine base have spread 
to other areas besides Central Huallaga, which has lost its 
exclusivity in this illegal business. 
  It is known that cocaine is produced in the Mayo River Basin 
(Department of San Martin), Alto Maranon (Amazonas), and the 
area of the Ene and Apurimac Rivers in the Departments of 
Ayacucho, Apurimac, and Junin. 
  Another important coca-growing area is Puerto Inca and 
Puerto 
Bermudez (Oxapampa and Pozuzo) in the Department of Pasco. 
<H5>  [Box, p A8] </H5>
<H5>  Fight Continues </H5>
  Even though it lacks the economic and logistical resources 
that it needs, the National Antidrug Directorate stepped up 
drugs seizures in the coca-growing areas of Alto Huallaga in 
1993. 
  For example, between January and October of 1993 alone, 
8,301 
kilos of drugs were seized, compared with 7,775 kilos for all of 
1992. 
  The number of underground laboratories discovered and 
destroyed during the first 10 months of 1993 was 38, compared 
with 54 in 1992. 
  Last year, 15 trenches for crushing coca leaves were 
destroyed. In 1992, 315 such trenches were found and dynamited. 
  Last year, authorities discovered 88,121 kilos of chemical 
ingredients, five small planes (three of which were seized and 
two destroyed), and 48 vehicles. 
  The 8,301 kilos of drugs seized from January to October of 
1993 included 5,195 of washed cocaine paste, 2,271 of raw PBC, 
434 of cocaine chlorhydrate, and 400 of marijuana.

  [Text] Over 290 kilos of cocaine hydrochloride were seized 
in 1993 by the Antidrug and Special Operations Squad (BAOE) of 
the Callao Air Customs Intendancy, a record figure that more 
than doubled the amount seized over the past three years. 
  Customs Intendant Jose Herrera Meza also revealed that last 
year the BAOE halted the illegal shipment out of the country of 
over 436 archeological treasures, paintings, and woven items 
concealed in other goods or equipment marked for export. 
  In addition, the unit found forged bills worth some 
$113,700, 
compared with only $65,000 in 1991. 
  Concerning the drug, RAP Captain Luis Otoya Moscol, head of 
the BAOE, said that in 1992 only 38 kilos and 415 grams of 
cocaine hydrochloride had been seized by Customs at Jorge Chavez 
International Airport. In Iquitos, 50 kilos and 590 grams of the 
same drug were seized, while 59 kilos and 770 grams of PBC 
[cocaine paste], and 7 kilos and 200 grams of washed paste were 
confiscated at the rest of the country's Customs stations.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Plantations in Peru 
  It has been reported that Colombian and Mexican mafia 
members 
had entered Peru by July 1993 and distributed poppy seeds among 
the coca growers of the Amazon, San Martin, and Huanuco regions, 
among others. Some growers already have sown the seeds but 
others still have not decided whether they will do it. 
  Nonetheless, poppy already had been planted in Cajamarca and 
the Amazon region before these mafia members visited them. Poppy 
plantations can be found in San Ignacio, Jaen, and Bambamarca in 
Cajamarca; as well as in Condorcanqui and Bagua in the Amazon 
region. In Piura Department, some plantations were detected in 
the Huancabamba area. 
  Maritza Rojas, chief of the Cedro [Information and Education 
Center to Prevent Drug Abuse] investigation area, pointed out 
that members of several Cedro programs being implemented in the 
jungle have been in San Martin in the last few months and were 
told about poppy being planted in the region. 
  Rojas added that at Naranjillo, Nueva Cajamarca, Roque, 
Soritor, Tabalosos, Tingo del Ponasa, and the Sauce area--in the 
Mayo, Sisa, and Biabo valleys--there are also poppy plantations. 
  She concluded by stating the other plantations were detected 
at Sarapampa in the Ayacucho jungle.

  [Text] A worrisome fact that could be a decisive factor for 
the expansion of poppy plantations in the country is the coca 
growers' readiness to replace their traditional coca plantations 
with poppy plantations. 
  The Cedro [Information and Education Center To Prevent Drug 
Abuse] has conducted a poll among 200 peasants from various 
settlements of San Martin and Huanuco Departments. Only 12 
percent of them said they would not replace coca with poppy. 
  Another 28 percent said that they would and the remaining 60 
percent were undecided. They said that, depending on the 
circumstances, they might. 
  Considering that the price of coca is extremely low and that 
very few people are purchasing coca leaves, these "undecided" 
peasants could easily begin to plant poppies. 
<H5>  A Matter of Survival </H5>
  Our correspondent in Tarapoto talked to Jesus Rivera, leader 
of the Selva Maestra Agrarian Federation (Fasma). Rivera 
asserted that a large number of peasants were willing to plant 
poppy if they had someone to sell it to. 
  "It is a matter of survival. The peasants must survive and 
to 
be able to do so they are willing to plant poppy. They have no 
other option because they have no access to loans that would 
enable them to replace their coca plantations with subsistance 
crops or any other authorized crop," he said. 
  Rivera, who participated in the crop replacement program 
negotiations, said that a large numnber of peasants have 
threatened to begin sowing poppy seeds next month, unless the 
government grants them credit or some other sort of assistance, 
as the regional officials have promised.

<F P=106> [Report by Annerys Gonzalez; from the "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Narcotics Division of the Judicial Technical 
Police [PTJ] made the headlines this week by seizing 1.5 tons of 
very pure cocaine thanks to outstanding intelligence work. The 
seizure has alarmed all drug traffickers, mainly due to the 
large sum of money involved. The cocaine consisted of 1,771 
individual packages, which were camouflaged to resemble spools, 
and was found in a warehouse in Maracay. Another 60 kg in 48 
additional packages was found in a warehouse belonging to 
Expriven Company in Guarenas. Finally, three more kg in six 
packages were seized in an apartment in the Santa Cruz 
neighborhood in Maracay. 
  [Begin recording] [PTJ Chief Orlando Jordan Petit] There are 
some spools around which one can wrap anything, such as wires, 
paper, and so on. A number of rolls, for lack of a better 
description, of the drug were wrapped around it ... 
  [Gonzalez, interrupting] To make it resemble what, Chief? 
  [Jordan Petit] The idea is to place the drug there to make 
it pass for the content of a spool, normally something else, any 
other product. This is perhaps one method they used nationwide 
to export the drug from Colombia and to distribute it 
nationally. This was also perhaps the mechanism they were using 
to ship it to the United States. [end recording] 
  The names of the six persons who were arrested are: Agustin 
Leon, a Venezuelan businessman; (Minges de Leon Janit), an 
American citizen and manager of Baduca Company; Pedro Julian 
Rosas, a Venezuelan driver for Expriven Company; Erlis Delgado, 
a Peruvian woman in charge of that company; Pedro Jose Rosas, an 
employee; and Carlos Ordones, businessman and local drug 
distributor. 
  [Begin Narcotics Division Chief Nerio Rengifo recording] 
This 
is one of the most important cases the PTJ, specifically the 
Narcotics Division, has worked on. It is the result of long 
months of hard work and follow-up and surveillance operations by 
members of the division. Their investigation of a number of 
companies with prior drug trafficking records in the United 
States led us to identify its members, and later, led us to 
discover and seize this large amount of cocaine. [end recording] 
  Thus, the Narcotics Division of the PTJ dealt a heavy blow 
to 
international drug trafficking. To finish dismantling this 
organization four persons belonging to one family are also being 
tracked down. They are Aurelio Carmelo, Ivan Mauricio, Harold, 
and Nabal, all members of the Villamizar family. They carry 
Colombian, Venezuelan, and U.S. identification documents.

  On 24 January, the PEOPLE'S COURT NEWS reported that the PRC 
authorities have executed eight people in Guizhou and Sichuan 
Provinces for drug smuggling and train robbery. Yang Cangrong 
and Zhou Yu, both from Guizhou, were arrested in the southern 
city of Guangzhou while trying to sell 757 grams of heroin which 
they had purchased in Vietnam. Qin Changgui and Yang Lin, also 
from Guizhou, were arrested for the possession of 3.9 kg and 3.4 
kg of opium respectively, which they had purchased in Yunnan 
Province. All four were executed in Guizhou earlier this month. 
Four members of a gang implicated in 16 train robberies were 
executed in Sichuan. (Summary) (Hong Kong AFP in English 1029

  On 24 January, the Yunnan Frontier Defense Forces of the 
Armed police held a commendation meeting on the struggle against 
the smuggling of guns and drugs in Kunming. At the meeting, it 
was announced that the Yunnan and Guangxi Frontier Defense 
Forces had received a Collective Award of Merit for their 
"remarkable results" in the struggle against gun and drug 
smuggling. Since the campaign against gun and drug smuggling 
began in June 1993, the Yunnan Frontier Defense Headquarters has 
cracked a total of 218 gun- smuggling cases, seizing 119 
military guns, 3,582 grenades, and 4,605 rounds of ammunition, 
and has solved 596 drug-trafficking cases, seizing 427.477 kg of 
heroin and 283.77 kg of opium. The Guangxi Frontier Defense 
Headquarters has solved a total of 100 gun-smuggling cases,

  On 28 December, the Lanzhou Intermediate People's Court 
handed down at first hearing death sentences on two embezzlers 
and two drug traffickers and deprived them of political rights 
for the rest of their lives. The four convicts were charged for 
embezzling public funds amounting to nearly 900,000 yuan and for 
trafficking over 600 grams of heroin. (Summary) (Lanzhou GANSU

  The Guangzhou public security departments cracked over 
33,000 
criminal cases last year, of which 14,000 were major ones, 
representing increases of 24 and 45 percent respectively over 
the previous year. In 1993, the public security departments 
wiped out over 5,200 crime syndicates, rounded up over 36,000 
criminal offenders, and seized over 200 vehicles, over 1,100 
motorcycles, and 310 million yuan worth of stolen goods, 
including gold and silver ornaments and home electrical 
appliances. They also seized over 200 firearms of various 
types, over 1000 rounds of ammunition, and over 130 kg of drugs.

  Shenzhen's Wenjindu Customs cracked a drug-trafficking case 
on 11 January, the first of its kind in 1995. When conducting a 
routine border check on a Hong Kong truck bearing the name of a 
Shenzhen transportation company, customs investigators found 
that the cargo area of the truck was empty, with the exception 
of a travelling bag behind the driver's seat. When the 
officials started to examine the bag, the driver jumped out of 
the truck in an unsuccessful attempt to escape. When the bag 
was opened, 40 bricks of heroin were found inside, weighing 
approximately 14 kg. The case is still under investigation.

<H5>  Yunnan </H5>
  Kunming, January 17 (CNS) -- Police in Yunnan Province 
smashed 4,174 cases of drug trafficking last year, with 6,191 
criminals of Chinese or foreign nationality arrested. The 
official in charge of the provincial anti-narcotics office said 
that the police had seized 3,546 kg of refined drugs, including 
heroin, a rise of 11 percent, and 1,062 kg of opium, an increase 
of 57 percent over the previous year, while the number of cases 
solved last year was 14 percent up over 1992, with the number of 
suspects arrested rising by ten percent. The provincial 
authorities helped some 20,000 drug addicts get rid of their 
drug addiction. Yunnan was also involved in international 
cooperation against drug trafficking, including one supported by 
the United Nations which achieved a measure of success. The 
official added that the area under cultivation of opium poppy in 
the so-called Golden Triangle had increased in size in recent 
years. Drug trafficking from beyond the borders of Yunnan has 
imposed a direct and serious threat to the province because the 
infiltration of drugs into the province has become a serious 
problem. Yunnan will go further in strengthening its work in 
fighting drugs and will try its best to stop narcotics from 
flowing into the province. (Text) (Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "China, U.S. Team Up in Drug </F>
Control"] 
  [Text] China and the United States have agreed to join 
efforts to fight drug trafficking and illegal immigration, 
according to officials of the Ministry of Public Security. 
  The agreement was signed by Bai Jingfu, vice-minister of 
Public Security and vice-director of the National Narcotics 
Control Committee and Robert Gelbard, the US Assistant Secretary 
of State for international narcotics affairs. 
  Through their talks on January 25 in Beijing, Bai and 
Gelbard 
exchanged views on how to solve the international narcotics 
problems, especially the sources in Asia, such as the notorious 
"Golden Triangle." The two sides agreed on the need to 
strengthen their cooperation in fighting drug crimes. The 
Chinese side expressed its hope that the United States would 
remove barriers impeding the two nations from working together 
to stop the international drug trade. Gelbard said the United 
States needs to work out new laws for curbing the increasing 
drug crimes. 
  During his stay in Beijing, Gelbard also held talks with 
Zhang Hongxi, director of the Consular Affairs Department of the 
Foreign Ministry, on illegal immigration. While briefing 
Gelbard on various factors that cause smuggling and illegal 
immigration and the steps China has taken to combat these kinds 
of illegal activities, Zhang reiterated China's opposition to 
such activities. He also asked the United States to clamp down 
on the "snakeheads," who have been found to be involved in 
smuggling Chinese people to the United States. He added that 
while the United States grants asylum to these smugglers who 
falsely claim that they are fleeing political persecution in 
China, it is encouraging such kind of smuggling. 
  Gelbard said his talks with the Chinese officials on both 
problems were satisfactory, and he and his Chinese counterparts' 
opinions on the matter were "very much along the same line." 
  Gelbard also visited China's Fujian, Guangdong and Yunnan 
provinces after leaving Beijing.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter Chang Shao-wei (1728 </F>
1421 1218): "China and the United States Increase Cooperation 
in Cracking Down on Crimes"] 
  [Text] "The Chinese and U.S. Governments have clear 
differences in terms of human rights, missile proliferation, and 
trade methods and we neither deny nor ignore them. However, 
since internationalized crime poses a common threat to both our 
countries, we are making joint efforts to face squarely the 
common interests we have on this issue." 
  That is the view aired by Robert Gelbard, U.S. assistant 
secretary of state for international narcotics matters, in a 
speech in Hong Kong yesterday. It was precisely for this reason 
that Gelbard recently led a high-level delegation to China to 
seek increased cooperation in cracking down on crime. 
  Since President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton met last 
November, Sino-U.S. relations have further improved. Gelbard's 
trip proves that, as two big powers, China and the United States 
have many spheres of cooperation. With the rise in 
international organized crime, the focus of the crackdown has 
shifted to how to get more information to accurately deal a 
crushing blow from top to bottom at transnational crime 
syndicates. This makes it necessary for the law-enforcement 
departments of various countries to work with good cooperation. 
  In his speech, Gelbard described how transnational organized 
crime syndicates carry out illegal activities with advanced 
weapons, telecommunications, and transport facilities, as well 
as monetary means. He said: "If the boss of an Asian syndicate 
enterprise wants to fix up a kidnapping case in New York, he can 
order his subordinate in New Jersey by directly dialling his 
subordinate's mobile telephone number using satellite 
telecommunications equipment. Afterward, they can make contact 
again by coded fax. If funds are needed, the money can be 
remitted to the United States electronically, possibly through a 
Hong Kong bank. The ransom can also be remitted to a bank in 
the Bahamas, then sent again from there to Panama, eventually 
arriving in a numbered Swiss bank account. The entire process 
can be completed in one day." 
  This description is like the plot of a movie but it is 
really 
shocking, especially the fact that what has been revealed is 
only the tip of the iceberg. Given such modern methods of 
committing crime, it has become even more difficult to crack 
down on crime. 
  Gelbard pointed out that half the drugs on the U.S. market 
come from Asia. 
  With the opening up of the country, the economic 
development, 
and the influx of Western ideas, various different factors have 
contributed to the resurrection of drug-taking in China, where 
it had disappeared for decades. The drug-trafficking activities 
through China's long borders have also become increasingly 
rampant. The crime syndicates in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the 
United States not only smuggle drugs to other countries through 
the Chinese mainland but also smuggle "human cargo" to the 
United States in a big way, making it more urgent for China and 
the United States to jointly crack down on such organized crime. 
  As a financial and information center, Hong Kong is 
naturally 
regarded by the international crime syndicates as a paradise for 
money laundering and a supreme headquarters for mobilizing and 
organizing various criminal activities. What is needed now is 
for the world's law-enforcement authorities to make joint 
efforts to crack down on the frenzied criminal activities. It 
is gratifying that such joint efforts are being stepped up. 
Gelbard said that from his talks with Chinese officials he had 
got the impression that the Chinese side approached 
drug-trafficking and other issues very seriously and 
conscientiously and that Sino-U.S. cooperation would be further 
strengthened. His successful visit to China also shows that 
through their joint efforts China and the United States can more 
effectively crack down on crimes and safeguard people's security 
and social stability.

  [Excerpts] The inauguration ceremony for the second 
Myanmar [Burma]-Thailand-Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] 
tripartite ministerial conference on cooperation in drug abuse 
control was held at 0900 today at the conference hall of the 
International Business Center on Prome Road, Yangon [Rangoon]. 
[passage contained in referent item omitted] 
  In his opening speech, Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, 
secretary-1 of the State Law and Order Restoration Council 
[SLORC], expressed his pleasure at having the opportunity to 
open the second ministerial conference of the LPDR, Thailand, 
and the Union of Myanmar on cooperation in drug abuse control. 
He said he warmly welcomed the delegates on behalf of the 
government and the people of the Union of Myanmar. He said he 
also welcomed the observers and representatives from Bangladesh, 
the PRC, India, the United Nations Drug Control Program [UNDCP], 
WHO, UNICEF, and FAO. 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that the menace of spreading 
narcotics use is a matter of major international concern, and 
the scourge of illicit drugs trafficked across international 
borders can be successfully overcome through the strength of 
international unity. Myanmar believes that all international 
cooperation at the individual, regional, and international 
levels are necessary for this endeavor. He said Myanmar is 
simultaneously combating narcotics in a national campaign and 
cooperating fully internationally in striving to solve the 
problems of illicit use, production, and traffic in narcotic 
drugs on all fronts. 
  After his speech, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt cordially greeted 
members of the Thai delegation, led by the deputy prime 
minister; the LPDR delegation led by the Prime Minister's Office 
minister; ambassadors; and representatives from the UN agencies. 
[passage contained in referent item omitted] 
  Speaking at the meeting, Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn, leader of the 
Myanmar delegation, chairman of the Central Committee for Drug 
Abuse Control [CCDAC], and home minister, said the cooperation 
of our three countries, which form part of the infamous Golden 
Triangle, in combating the menace of narcotics will be seen as 
an important milestone in the history of the world. He said 
such an endeavor serves the interests of all humanity. 
  Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn said that the countries attending the 
current conference are part of the region known as the Golden 
Triangle. He said everyone knows who created the Golden 
Triangle and who is smearing its image with black paint. He 
said collective efforts for solution of the problem, rather than 
the practice of blaming one another, will gradually bring an end 
to the narcotics problem. 
  He said the history of the narcotics problem of our country 
was presented at the first meeting. He said remarkable efforts 
had been made by Myanmar since the first meeting. He said a 
ministry for development of border regions, where most opium is 
grown, and national races was formed on 24 September 1992 and 
that the Law on Development of Border Regions and National Races 
was enacted on 13 August 1993. He said one of the objectives of 
the law is to totally eradicate the cultivation of narcotic 
drugs by establishing economic enterprises. He said priority 
has been given to this task since May 1989 and as of the end of 
1993, the state has spent Kyat 1,512.4 million for this task. 
He said the task of eradicating opium cultivation in Kokang 
Region within six years and Wa Region within 10 years is being 
carried out in consultation with the local national leaders. 
  Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn said agreements had been signed by 
Myanmar 
and PRC and the UNDCP and Myanmar, Thailand, and the UNDCP on 12 
June 1992 under joint regional program for narcotic drug 
eradication with financial assistance from the UNDCP. 
Representatives from Laos were invited to attend the meetings 
held by Myanmar. Furthermore, an agreement was signed with 
India on cooperation in combating narcotics on 30 March 1993 and 
the first meeting was held in New Delhi on 19 October 1993. It 
is hoped that a cooperation agreement with Laos would be signed 
with assistance from UNDCP. Similar consultations will be made 
with Bangladesh. 
  Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn said cooperative efforts and common 
objectives of the neighboring countries had earned them praise 
from the 36th Conference of the Narcotic Drugs Commission held 
in 29 March-7 April 1993 in Vienna, Austria. The commission 
conference urged West Asia and other regions to take similar 
action. He said another outstanding endeavor was the signing of 
the memorandum of understanding by representatives of Myanmar, 
PRC, Laos, and Thailand on cooperation in combatting illicit 
traffic and use of narcotic drugs on 26 October 1993 at the UN 
Headquarters. 
  Continuing, Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn explained the Narcotic Drugs 
and Psychotropic Substances Law on 27 January 1993. He said this 
law was drafted and promulgated in accordance with the 
provisions of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit 
Traffice in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. He said 
the menace of narcotic drugs is growing while psychotropic 
substances are now infiltrating our countries. In addition, he 
said, the task of banning chemicals used in refining narcotic 
drugs is also very important. 
  Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn explained that there is no illicit 
production of these chemicals in Myanmar and there are strict 
restrictions on the matter and the new law contains effective 
penalites. Constant watch is maintained for illegal traffic in 
these chemicals from neighboring countries. Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn 
said that under the new law, laundering financial proceeds from 
the narcotics trade in the form of movable as well as immovable 
property and bank deposits can be investigated and they can be 
confiscated as public property. He said profit is the main 
motive behind the illicit production and trafficking of 
narcotics, and only when the proceeds can be confiscated as 
public property can its machinery be stopped. Similarly, it is 
necessary to make joint efforts to contain traffic in 
narcotics-related chemicals. 
  What is more important is that the drug traffickers can 
easily move across borders and disregard international 
boundaries. It can be seen that they are even capable of defying 
governments concerned with illegal weapons. Therefore, it is 
about time that countries producing weapons stop this illegal 
trade. Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn said the Cold War is over and all 
countries should join hands in working to combat AIDS--an 
offshoot of the menace of narcotics--in the interests of all 
humanity. Therefore, in conclusion, he urged all countries to 
continue to cooperate until success is achieved in accordance 
with the motto: Prevent and Combat the Menace of Narcotic Drugs 
Which Endanger Humanity. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Thailand yesterday agreed to set up border task 
forces with Burma and Laos to improve the efficiency of local 
officials from the three countries in their joint campaign 
against illegal drugs trade. 
  Narcotics Control Board Secretary General, Chawalit Yotmani, 
said the Thai-Burmese and Thai-Lao border task forces would 
enable anti-narcotics officials to take immediate action to 
prevent and suppress the production and trafficking of narcotics 
without having to wait for the decision of the governments of 
the respective countries. 
  The task forces would also make way for the improvement of 
intelligence operations and a better flow of information about 
drug traffickers among Thai Lao and Burmese officials, Pol Gen 
Chawalit said. [sentence as published] 
  Agreements on the border task forces were reached at 
yesterday's second ministerial-level meeting on drugs prevention 
and suppression in Rangoon which was attended by top government 
leaders and senior officials of Thailand, Laos and Burma. 
  The Thai task forces will be headed by Narcotics Suppression 
Bureau commissioner Somchai Milindarangkun. 
  Pol Lt Gen Somchai said the first meeting of Thai and 
Burmese 
officials will be held in Chiang Rai's Mae Sai District opposite 
Burma's border town of Tachilek in March, to work out joint 
drugs prevention and suppression plans. 
  The date of the meeting with Laos has not yet been scheduled 
but the venue will be in the northeastern province of Nong Khai, 
he said. 
  Pol Lt Gen Somchai conceded that coordinating efforts with 
Burma was likely to be more difficult than working with Laos as 
Thailand and Laos have already been close to one another and 
have always exchanged information. 
  He said Thailand should strengthen its cooperation with 
Burma 
so both sides can have a common understanding and trust one 
another. 
  "Trust in each other would help boost efficiency in our 
attempt to get updated information that would lead to the arrest 
of drug traffickers," he said. 
  Meanwhile, Pol Gen Chawalit said Thailand and Burma would 
also hold a discussion on problems about minority groups along 
their common border because some of these groups have been 
involved in narcotics production. 
  He said the three countries also agreed that meetings of 
their senior anti-drugs officials would be held twice a year and 
a ministerial-level meeting once every two years. 
  Cooperation would also be sought from China and Vietnam and 
these two countries will be invited to join in the next meeting, 
he said. 
  Thailand earlier pledged to provide training assistance 
under 
18 drug prevention and suppression projects to Burma and Lao 
officials between 1994 and 1996 at a cost of 8.2 million baht. 
  The meeting, which ends today, will be wrapped up with the 
signing of a joint declaration on narcotics suppression 
cooperation by Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan, Burma's 
Interior Minister Mya Than and Laotian PM's Office Minister Phao 
Bounaphon. 
  A joint declaration on the elimination of narcotics and drug 
trafficking in the region was signed at the first 
ministerial-level meeting in Bangkok in 1992.

<F P=106> [Report by Doron Me'iri] </F>
  [Excerpts] Last Thursday, 7 o'clock in the evening. 
Dozens of youngsters wearing kaffiyehs and armed with batons 
and knives flock to the headquarters of Fatah's "strike police" 
in the village of Abu-Dis in East Jerusalem for their daily 
briefing. All of them are intifadah graduates who decided to 
renounce terror and join the fight against mounting crime in 
their community. [passage omitted] 
  Fatah's "strike police" units began operating about three 
months ago. Their intentions may be good, but their methods are 
shocking. Their activities are primarily aimed at drug dealers. 
Lists of suspected drug dealers and places where deals are 
conducted can be found in its headquarters. The information is 
collected from informers and snitches. 
  "Strike police" troops raid drug-dealing areas every night. 
People caught dealing drugs face a bitter fate: They are taken 
for interrogation in the organization's dungeons where they 
undergo excruciating torture in order to extract from them 
information. A man I encountered at the "strike police" 
headquarters smilingly told me: "Believe me, I have been 
arrested many times in my life--by Israel Police and by the Shin 
Bet--but what our interrogators do to their subjects is 
absolutely terrifying." 
  Twenty-six-year-old Shakir, the commander of the "strike 
police" adds: "We interrogate them, and with our methods they 
talk, and talk fast. When the interrogation is over, we break 
one of their arms or legs, their nose, or even slightly fracture 
their skull. Then we explain to them that they are harming 
themselves and the public, and warn them that if caught again 
they will be eliminated." 
  The "strike police" opens "criminal records" for suspects, 
as 
if it were a real police force, and plays the role of 
legislator, judge, and executioner. Shakir argues that his men 
do not restrict their operations to East Jerusalem, and chase 
Arab drug dealers into the boundaries of the Green Line. At 
least on one occasion, Shakir recounts, a drug dealer from the 
territories was spotted in Elat, where he had fled to protect 
himself from the "strike police." This dealer "was arrested and 
dealt with appropriately," Shakir notes. 
  He showed us the weapons used by his men. These include 
batons, ice picks, knives, screwdrivers, ropes, and handcuffs. 
"We do not yet have firearms," he says. "Until three months 
ago our goal had been to fight you, the Israelis. However, from 
the moment 'Arafat and Rabin shook hands, our goal became to 
fight for a better and healthier society, both ours and yours." 
  Shakir argues that his methods have proved themselves, 
seeing 
that the activities of drug dealers in the area has decreased 
considerably. According to him, many of them relocated their 
business to the boundaries of the Green Line for fear of the 
"strike police." "It is important that your police deal with 
them and not let them off the hook," he says. 
  Shakir continues: "The heads of the Palestinian leadership 
apprised Abu-'Ammar (Yasir 'Arafat) of our activities, and we 
were told that he gave them his blessing and that he is pleased 
with them. I hope he will heed our request and give us 
financial aid. In future I definitely envision myself as an 
officer in the Palestinian police force, and I will be happy to 
cooperate with Israel Police to fight crime." 
  The "strike police" has also undertaken the task of dealing 
with drug addicts. Any addict caught in the act is asked to 
enter a rehabilitation center voluntarily. If he fails to do 
that, such treatment is forced on him for four months. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] After three months of extensive searching, the 
various departments of the general administration for narcotics, 
in cooperation with security officers from Bani Suwayf and 
al-Minya, succeeded in seizing 20 kilograms of heroin amounting 
to 25 million pounds. An Egyptian belonging to the 
international mafia gangs was trying to smuggle the heroin to 
flood the governorates with the white poison. The car is a 
public sector car registered to an iron-casting company in Aswan. 
  The operation to seize the vehicle took place after tracking 
and pursuing them for over 750 kilometers starting from Idfu in 
Aswan up to Cairo.

  [Text] Zahedan, Sistan-Baluchestan Prov., Feb. 5, IRNA -- 
The law enforcement forces are tracking down a group of bandits 
who killed and looted passengers in Tasuki region in this 
southeastern border province last Thursday, a law enforcement 
commander said here Saturday. 
  According to Major Mehrani, the bandits will be severely 
suppressed. 
  The bandits, involved in drug trafficking, have stepped up 
their activities since two weeks ago when the law enforcement 
forces started checking all the roads through which drugs were 
smuggled to the province and arrested two four-member gangs with 
a large quantity of drugs, he said. 
  Major Mehrani added that all the roads which used to be 
taken 
by the bandits were under full control and that bandits could no 
longer be engaged in illegal activities. 
  The drug trafficking gangs, he continued, had resorted to 
blocking several roads leading to the provincial capital and 
looting civilians and passengers after being severely confronted 
by the law enforcement forces and being entrapped in the 
province. 
  With the reinforcements sent to the region yesterday, 
security has been maintained on the roads and all the area is 
being mopped out from the bandits and corrupt elements. 
[sentence as received] 
  The operation for tracking down the bandits will be 
continued 
until full security is established in the region, Major [passage 
indistinct].

  [Text] By closing about 840 km of the country's eastern 
borders against the smugglers, routes used by the 
drug-trafficking convoys from the borders into the country are 
blocked. 
  Interior Minister ['Ali Mohammad] Besharati, in an interview 
with our correspondent, also said: The task of closing the 
borders in the vulnerable areas began from four months ago. The 
job was completed by digging canals of four meters deep and four 
meters wide, erection of many watch towers, and planting of 
mines along the routes used by the drug-trafficking convoys. At 
present there is no possibility of such convoys finding their 
way into the country. 
  About the recent disturbances in Zahedan, which took place 
with provocation of the drug-traffickers, the interior minister 
praised the Muslim and revolutionary people of Zahedan for 
staging a rally on Sunday to condemn the action of these 
saboteurs. He said: The Shiite and Sunni brothers and sisters, 
by staging a march in Zahedan to protest against the 
drug-traffickers, have once again demonstrated their support for 
the Islamic revolution, the esteemed leader, and the president, 
and they have terminated all the conspiracies spread by internal 
and foreign enemies.

  [Text] Piranshahr, W. Azarbaijan Prov., Feb. 8, IRNA -- 
There is some evidence that a large part of Dahuk Province in 
north of Iraq is under poppy cultivation. Publication of a map 
which has unveiled the activities of narcotics dealing bands in 
northern Iraq in the past three years, has caused a great 
concern among political and religious Kurdish circles whether 
the northern Iraq would be turned into a drug dealing center. 
  A 35-year old member of a Kurdish political group in 
northern 
Iraq who preferred not to be named, said that cultivation fields 
are in the areas under the control of `Guli' and `Birwari' 
tribes in Zakho. Some Iraqi military officials who have spent a 
hard life in the mountains in northern Iraq have taken advantage 
of the situation and are cooperating with the bands. 
  In view of the observers who are following developments in 
the region, if current trend is continued, northern Iraq will be 
turned into a big centre for production and distribution of 
narcotics of the `golden triangle' type.

  [Text] Lagos, 7 Feb (NAN) -- Twelve of the 14 NDLEA 
[Nigerian National Drug Law Agency] officials arrested in 
connection with the missing 12 wraps of heroin exhibits from the 
custody of the agency, were arraigned in Lagos today before the 
Justice Olufunmilayo Oni-Okpaku-led miscellaneous offences 
tribunal, the NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) reports. The 
officials included the director-general of the agency, Mr. Bappa 
Jama'are, who was represented by Dr. Yusuf Dibal, Abdulkarim 
Mohammed Bello, Steven Ogundayo and Hyeladzie Nganjiwa. The 
others are Alhaji Abdullahi Yunusa, Y. Saleh, Bala Ibn Na' 
allah, Olusegun Roland, Jacob Idowu, Y. Bayawo, Adamu Tukur, and 
A. Audu. 
  At the trial of the officials today, the prosecutor told the 
tribunal that Bappa Jama'are and his personal assistant, Jerry 
Kumbisi, could not appear before the tribunal because they are 
on an official tour abroad. The director of public prosecutions 
in the Federal Ministry of Justice, Mrs. Wonu Folami, pleaded 
for an adjournment of the trial of the NDLEA officials because 
of the ministerial enquiry set up by the Justice Ministry to 
look into the theft of the drug exhibits. However, the tribunal 
chairman, Justice Oni-Okpaku, dismissed the application saying 
the issue of the theft is of very high magnitude, the domestic 
enquiry cannot be allowed to delay proceedings. 
  She also rejected another application by the DPP to grant 
bail to the suspects. Justice Oni-Okpaku later released four of 
the officials--Steven Ogundayo, Adamu Tukur, Alhaji Y. Saleh and 
Hyeladzie Nganjiwa--who only accompanied the vehicle that 
conveyed the burnt exhibit on Thursday. In another development, 
the tribunal turned down an appeal by Joe Brown Akubueze asking 
it to grant him one week more to enable him to secure the 
services of a lawyer.

  [Text] Lagos, 9 Feb. (NAN/PANA) -- Another detained 
Nigerian national drug law enforcement agent, Audu Adams, has 
been released by the country's Miscellaneous Offences Tribunal. 
Tribunal chairman Justice Funmilayo Oni-Okpaku ordered the 
release Tuesday, in view of the appeal made by the director of 
public prosecution, Wonu Folami, that Adams never saw the drug 
exhibits till the day the tribunal went to inspect them. Folami 
also urged the tribunal to release the remaining 10 agents 
detained in order for them to continue investigations in the 
case. But the tribunal chairman declined to grant her request, 
saying that the officials were charged with interfering with the 
exhibit and, as such, would not be released, until evidence to 
the contrary was provided. 
  On the continuous silence by Joe Brown Akubueze, the man who 
imported drugs into Nigeria, Justice Oni-Okpaku ruled that it 
was clear that the accused had no intention of securing a lawyer 
and was deliberately delaying the proceedings by refusing to 
speak up in court. 
  In another development, one Oluyemi Abisayo, surety to 
socialite Jennifer Madike, was arrested Tuesday and brought to 
the tribunal because Madike, who was ordered to appear before 
the tribunal, could not be found. The tribunal ordered Abisayo 
to assist the police "in getting Jennifer" while the case was 
adjourned to 15 February.

  [Text] A task force to evolve means of eradicating all 
problem-associated hard drugs was inaugurated in Abuja today by 
the chief of general staff, Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya. He 
said the task force is in line with the promise to fight the 
menace of hard drugs contained in the head of state's maiden 
broadcast. State House correspondent Mohammed Labo reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Labo] Inaugurating the task force, Lt. 
Gen. Diya said that it is ironical that the government agency, 
created to fight drug abuse and trafficking in narcotics, has 
become prone to corrupt tendencies. He described the recent 
disappearance of some wraps [individual packages] of heroin 
seized last year from a suspected hard drug trafficker as a 
manifestation of the level of corruption and collusion that 
emasculates Nigeria's anti-narcotic efforts. The terms of 
reference given the panel include: Eradication of all problems 
associated with hard drugs in the country, enforcement of 
security checks at all ports and international routes with 
immediate effect, working in close liaison with the Armed 
Forces, police, and particularly the Ministry of Justice to 
ensure immediate arrest of culprits through investigations and 
prompt prosecution in the courts. The chief of general staff 
has the other terms of reference: 
  [Diya] [video in progress shows chief of general staff 
seated, reading out terms of reference to the task force] 
...render monthly reports to the head of state and 
commander-in-chief, through the office of the chief of general 
staff on all activities of the task force. 
  G. [As heard] Examine the capability and integrity of the 
personnel of the NDLEA [National Drug Law Enforcement Agency] as 
at presently constituted in carrying out its functions under the 
enabling law. 
  H. Examine the general structure of the NDLEA and determine 
its suitability for carrying out its functions under the 
enabling law. 
  [Labo] Members of the task force are Brigadier General Musa 
Bamayi, chairman; Group Captain William Pratt; Lieutenant 
Colonel Taicos; Commander Odigie; assistant commissioner of 
police Giade; and Mr. Adabale. The chairman of the task force, 
Brig. Gen. Bamayi, promised that the task force would try to 
accomplish its mission successfully. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Kenny Ilasha Commentary] </F>
  [Text] As part of the global effort to combat drug 
trafficking, the United Nations organized a conference in Geneva 
in 1988, at which time a resolution was adopted which made 
laundering drug money a crime. The conference called on all 
nations to enact municipal legislation against laundering. A 
year later, the Nigerian authorities promulgated Decree No.48 of 
1989 which provides a jail term of not less than 25 years as 
punishment for anyone convicted of laundering money earned from 
illegal drug trafficking. The law also stipulates a fine of 2 
million naira for a corporate body found guilty of laundering. 
This was roughly five years ago. But since then no single 
person has been prosecuted under the decree. The impression 
which one will get from this is that money laundering has not 
been going on in Nigeria. But this is most probably a wrong 
impression. Not many Nigerians are unaware of the establishment 
of large-scale ventures by proprietors whose sources of income 
are questionable. But problem really is that most Nigerians do 
not bother to ask pertinent questions about sources of income. 
And this is why the society tends to accommodate all sorts of 
characters who use money from whatever source to procure 
respectability. With law, however, it should be a different 
matter altogether. The law enforcement agencies should be 
encouraged or even compelled to trace the sources of sudden 
wealth by individuals or groups. The aim in this particular 
consideration is to prevent or stamp out money laundering which 
constitutes a serious danger to the economy. 
  There are several ways of laundering drug money. The most 
prominent is through bank transactions. The proceeds with drug 
business are lodged in a bank, particularly in a country where 
the transactions were carried out or in a neighboring state. 
The money is lodged by using fictitious business names. In 
most cases, the banks are interested in the economic gains which 
may accrue from such huge lodgement. Besides, the banks 
emphasize the need for confidentiality between them and their 
customers. The launderer then repatriates the money, sometimes 
through inter-bank transactions or through what looks like a 
legitimate business venture. That explains why such businesses 
as boutiques, supermarkets of expensive tastes, and motor 
companies parading luxury and state of the art vehicles spring 
up in parts of the country. Some of the drug traffickers import 
goods with the proceeds and these are brought into the country 
through the sea port. At the port, there is a syndicate which 
cuts across all departments which make sure that there is no 
hitch in clearing the goods and other transactions. 
  As for the economy as a whole, it is believed that the black 
or autonomous market, through which the naira is traded at very 
low rate in relations with other currencies, responded largely 
with proceeds from drug trafficking. Besides, the drug 
traffickers, through their expensive tastes, have infested the 
society with strange orientations. In a situation where money 
can be got through easily or repatriated with little effort, not 
many people would like to depend on hard work to earn their 
livelihood. They would rather join the company of drug peddlers 
to make the easy money. This is a terrible danger to the 
society. As the need to check the adverse effect of laundering 
on the nation and its economy becomes imperative, it may be 
necessary to review the relevant legislations to make it 
possible for security agents to investigate bank accounts 
without hindrance. The banks themselves should be compelled to 
inquire into the sources of huge lodgements and alert the 
appropriate authorities. In this way, the country would be put 
in a better position to protect its economy from the effects of 
money laundering.

  [Text] Police in the South African port city of Durban has 
smashed an international drug smuggling syndicate, following the 
seizure of compressed marijuana with a street value of about 2 
million dollars. A police spokesman said a team of detectives 
had swooped on a truck that had arrived from neighboring 
Swaziland earlier this week. He said the marijuana had been 
found hidden in a false compartment in the floor of the truck. 
It is believed that the marijuana was destined for The 
Netherlands.

<F P=106> [Interview with Brigo Asparukhov, director of the National </F>
Intelligence Service, by Angelina Petrova; place and date not 
given: "Secret List of Companies Belonging to State Security Was 
Openly Photocopied in Interior Ministry"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Petrova] What information 
does the NRS have about the present participation of Bulgarians 
in the narcotics trafficking that has always been routed through 
our country? 
  [Asparukhov] I am worried about the possibility that in the 
near future, narcotics money will flow into our economy during 
the forthcoming privatization. When this happens, it will 
become almost impossible to combat the narcotics trade. This 
money will then be laundered and no one will be able to prove 
its origin. The profits from narcotics trafficking worldwide 
amount to U.S.$400 billion. 
  The fight against organized crime, of which the sale of 
narcotics forms a part, requires decisive actions. This 
primarily means we need a clear program, in which the NRS and 
all the Interior Ministry organs should play a part. It is 
particularly important that the National Security Service--our 
counterintelligence--is also involved. [passage omitted] 
  [Petrova] Those who defend the protection and security 
companies claim that they have succeeded in preventing foreign 
mafias, including the Russian mafia, from establishing 
themselves in Bulgaria. Is this true? 
  [Asparukhov] There are no grounds for making such a claim. 
It is a manifest fact that foreign mafias or organized criminal 
groups from the former socialist countries, Russia included, are 
invading our country. Money, narcotics, and criminals are being 
imported to carry out special tasks for the criminal world. The 
private security firms in Bulgaria probably have their part to 
play in the future market economy, but it will hardly be within 
their powers to deal with the penetration of foreign mafias. 
This claim is frivolous. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, Feb 9 (CTK) -- Czech Police have succeeded 
in busting seven "drug labs," seizing 10 kg of narcotic 
substances worth at least 10 million korunas ($350,000), a Czech 
Police spokesman told journalists today. 
  Thirteen people involved in the production and distribution 
of the hard drugs seized--mainly pervitin and efedrin 
[ephedrine]--have been detained as a result of "Operation Wind" 
in which the drug squad of the Criminal Police Central Office 
(UKP) was joined by the Prague Investigations Office. 
  The drug haul was previously reported as having a street 
value of one million korunas ($34,000). 
  The operation, which took place on February 1-2, was the 
biggest and most successful conducted in recent years against 
drug production in Prague, the spokesman said. 
  The suspects have also been charged with illegal possession 
of weapons. 
  According to chief of the drug squad Miroslav Bornik, the 
squad launched 625 operations last year and detained a total of 
109 suspects. 
  Bornik said the raid was particularly successful because the 
police did not only find "the normal boilers" where the drugs 
are produced but also a layer of people who were concerned only 
with dealing. He added that the drug squad returned to a 
laboratory they had destroyed only a few hours earlier to find 
it completely re-equipped and operational again. 
  During the raid police also discovered a considerable sum of 
money, communications technology, and two stolen cars, he said. 
  Czech anti-drug legislation is in contradiction with the 
NATO 
agreement of 1988, Bornik said. In his view, if possession of 
drugs for personal use is legal and no quantity is specified, it 
is extremely difficult to take action against producers and 
manufacturers. Prosecution would be possible only if a dealer 
was caught in the very moment he passed drugs onto someone else, 
he said.

<F P=106> ["(hop)"-signed report: "Drugs Are Mainly Smuggled Across </F>
the Czech Republic"] 
  [Text] Prague -- "The Czech Republic is far behind 
advanced Western countries in drug use," declared Interior 
Minister Jan Ruml. "Nevertheless, we rank among the countries 
across which narcotic substances are smuggled. At the same 
time, I do not deny that, to a certain extent, we are also one 
of the target and production countries but certainly not to the 
same extent as Western European states. It is our duty to 
prevent a drug environment being created in our country." 
  This was the interior minister's reaction to the recent 
statement by Council of Europe Secretary General Catherine 
Lalumiere that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe 
provide a suitable setting for the activities of various 
narcotics mafias. 
  According to our information, 18.5 kilograms of heroin, just 
under 5.0 kilograms of cocaine, 3.0 kilograms of morphine, 7.0 
kilograms of hashish, and 7.0 kilograms of amphetamines were 
seized in our country last year. Some 149 Czech citizens and 21 
foreign nationals were arrested for producing, smuggling, and 
distributing narcotic and psychotropic substances. Operation 
Bumerang, directed against pervitin producers in the capital and 
in the Kladno region, was one of the most successful police 
interventions in 1993. 
  Some 31 Czech citizens were investigated abroad last year 
for 
drug smuggling. The largest haul--47 kilograms of heroin--was 
found on a Czech citizen in Amsterdam in May. Two Czech drug 
traffickers, who tried to smuggle high-quality Asian heroin from 
Turkey to Western Europe last year, are now awaiting trial in a 
Bulgarian prison. The payment for such a risky journey is 
between $10,000 and $20,000.

Romanian and foreign citizens, including Alexandru Sava Dogmanov 
thought to be the head of the gang, was arrested last summer

100 kilos of cocaine hidden in two statuettes coming from 
Venezuela. Police said it identified and arrested the whole

<F P=106> [Emmanuelle Peyret report: "Pan-European Conference on Drug </F>
Addiction"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg -- "Eastern Europe must, first of all, 
learn its lessons from the failures of the West in the fight 
against drug trafficking and consumption: Repression has shown 
its limitations. From now on, we must gear all our efforts 
toward prevention and education." This was how Raymond Kendall, 
the secretary general of Interpol, summed up the conclusions of 
the second pan-European conference on drug addiction, which 
brought together some 40 European health ministers at the 
Council of Europe. 
  Prevention and education: Those were the main points of the 
conference, along with an underlying current of aid to the 
countries of eastern Europe, which are, for the moment, totally 
devoid of any legislation, institutions, or specialist 
personnel. Cooperation with the governments of the countries of 
eastern Europe, which are asking for a great deal of aid to 
combat drugs, "is slowly taking shape," explained Christopher 
Luckett, head of the drug division at the Pompidou group. 
"These countries have set up government committees on drug 
trafficking with which we are working," continued Luckett. 
  Unlike our Western democracies, eastern Europe is not yet 
used to a high level of consumption of hard drugs. "In these 
countries, alcohol, solvents, and the abuse of medicines 
prevail," continued Luckett. The priority in the fight against 
drugs is therefore, as the Interpol head stressed, "to prevent 
the importation of a consumption market into eastern Europe. 
This is where prevention is essential," something which could 
be implemented through pan- European action. 
  However, eastern Europe--a drug transit region via the 
historic Balkan route, which bypasses wars like the one in 
Yugoslavia, or which finds different ways--has primarily become 
a major production area. This is what really worries most of 
the participants at the Strasbourg conference. "Indeed, our 
biggest worry today, or at least the worry of the institutions 
which are fighting drug trafficking and production, is the 
implantation of tens of thousands of hectares with poppy and 
cannabis growing in the Asiatic republics of the former USSR: 
Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan have now become 
uncontrollable areas for us, where local and ethnic conflicts 
are mixed up with arms and drug trafficking, with the one 
financing the other." Luckett concludes that Europe has no 
weapons to fight this.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Commissioner Flynn in Favor of </F>
Action Against Drugs Being Extended to Eastern Europe"; as 
released by Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] In a speech last week before the 10th ministerial 
conference of the Pompidou Group in Strasbourg, and then before 
the 2d pan-European ministerial conference on cooperation on 
illicit drug abuse problems today, Mr. Padraig Flynn, European 
Commissioner with overall responsibility for drug issues, 
stressed the European Union's commitment to making the fullest 
possible use of the new instruments of the Treaty on European 
Union to strengthen the fight against drugs. He insisted that 
any Union approach to the drugs phenomenon could only be truly 
comprehensive if it were integrated into a wider European and 
global strategy, which in turn pointed to the importance of the 
Pan-European Conference. Commissioner Flynn drew attention to 
the disturbing increase in illicit drugs activities in Central 
and Eastern Europe and asked for these countries to be assisted 
in their efforts to create an effective and multidisciplinary 
drugs strategy. The Pan-European Conference must provide the 
platform "for an ever more intense and comprehensive effort" in 
the fight against illicit drugs.

  [Text] At the end of January two suspected drug dealers 
were arrested in Vienna's 10th district carrying heroin with a 
black market value of about 1 million schillings. One of the 
suspects, a father of four from Turkey who has heavy debts, has 
admitted that he wanted to sell the drugs to an Austrian client. 
The second man vehemently denies having known this. 
  According to an official of the Vienna Security Bureau, an 
arrest warrant has been issued for the suspected mastermind of 
the drug deal, 25-year-old Turk Huseyin C.

  [Text] For some time Bratislava has been considered a 
center for drug gangs active in Western Europe. Competition is 
great, which sometimes helps the police. 
  Thus, investigators of the Vienna Security Bureau learned 
that a "large Mercedes from Slovakia" would arrive on 27 January 
to deliver heroin for a deal in a restaurant in Vienna's 15th 
district. The officials waited and pulled three "innocents" and 
1 kg of heroin out of circulation. 
  Croat Cani N., 43, who drives a Mercedes 500-SEL, had a cafe 
in Vienna some years ago, and is now operating an import-export 
company in Bratislava, claims that he only took "a package from 
A to B" to earn 6,000 German marks. Slovak Klaudia B., 25, on 
whom 35,000 marks were found, only wanted to "visit a friend in 
Vienna. The suspected main perpetrator, Vietnamese Minh Bang 
T., 30, who lives in Munich, refuses to say anything at all."

<F P=106> ["Welt-Nachrichtendienst" report: "Fewer Youths Sentenced"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- The number of minors sentenced for theft 
and embezzlement has declined by 60 percent in 10 years. In a 
response to a grand inquiry by Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and Free Democratic Party of 
Germany [FDP] on the topic "situation of Young People in 
Germany," approved by the Cabinet in Bonn yesterday, FRG Youth 
Minister Angela Merkel said that, on the one hand, this is due 
to the demographic development. On the other, the youth courts 
refrain from sentencing the culprits in particular in case of 
less serious crime and use other kinds of punishment. 
  According to the criminal prosecution statistics, the number 
of young people sentenced for theft and embezzlement declined 
from 41,809 in 1982 to 16,528 in 1991. The number of young 
people sentenced for acts of violence has also declined--from 
8,799 by one-third to 5,937. 
  FRG Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger 
(FDP) 
expressed concern about the "alarmingly high involvement of 
young people in acts of violence with right-wing extremist 
motives and xenophobic crimes." The share of young people up to 
20 years of age in acts of violence with proven or suspected 
right-wing extremist motives amounted to about 69 percent in 
1991 and 67 percent in 1992. From January 1991 to April 1992 
alone this share amounted to 75 percent, the minister reported. 
She stressed that, from the viewpoint of the Federal 
Government, the current criminal law relating to young offenders 
is sufficient also to punish right-wing extremist violent 
crimes. A general tightening of the law is not intended. For 
serious crimes committed by young people a prison term of up to 
10 years is possible. However, this statutory punishment is 
hardly ever imposed. 
  The Cabinet was also presented with figures on young drug 
addicts and alcoholics. The proportion of young alcoholics 
between 18 and 24 years of about 2.5 million alcoholics is 4.6 
percent among men and 3.7 percent among women in the old 
laender. For the new laender there is information available 
only on the proportion of male alcoholics in this age group, 
which is 3.1 percent. 
  The proportion of opiate-addicted young people in the old 
laender is 30 percent of all drug addicts among men and 4 
percent among women. For young people addicted to 
pharmaceuticals the figures are 23 and 14.7 percent respectively.

  [Text] Naples, Italy, Feb 9 (AFP) -- Police have smashed a 
drug-trafficking ring involving heroin worth 50 billion lire (30 
million dollars) and arrested 42 people, police sources said 
Tuesday [8 February]. 
  A further 28 people already serving prison sentences were 
also said to be implicated in the ring, which came to light 
following confessions by five former members of the Camorra, the 
Neapolitan Mafia. 
  According to the confessions, the drug trafficking was 
controlled by 12 Mafia families headed by boss Raffaele Ascione. 
  Up to 1,000 fixes of heroin a day were being sold by the 
gang. Police did not say if they had seized the drugs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Atlas of Crime And Extortion"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- A world atlas of criminal organizations is 
currently being prepared. It has been mapped out by the 
Interior Ministry, in cooperation with the Gino Germani Research 
Center and the Luiss independent university, and will be 
completed in June, at the close of a cycle of conferences on the 
subject of "Comparative Analysis of Criminal Systems in the 
Contemporary World." 
  In the course of the first three conferences, Interior 
Ministry and investigation department officials illustrated the 
history, current numbers, interest sectors, and the capacity to 
infiltrate institutions, of the main Mafia organizations 
operating on Italian territory. 
  Camorra--Dimensions: 107 clans; 6,000 members; approximately 
1,000 flankers; 50,000-60,000 people directly involved. 
Characteristics: horizontal, individualistic, prevalently urban 
structure; indifferent to political ideologies; maximum 
territorial control; not very prone to strategic alliances. 
Main activities: extortion, drug dealing and peddling (heroin 
and cocaine), illegal lotteries, cigarette smuggling, business 
activities, public tenders, extortion, truck robberies. New 
directions: drugs, real estate investments, joint ventures 
abroad, interest in the leisure activities market, tourism, 
lawful trading in tobacco products. 
  'Ndrangheta--Dimensions: approximately 150 criminal 
brotherhoods, comprising more than 5,500 members. 
Characteristics: vertical, family-based structure; marked 
capacity to infiltrate institutions; marked capacity to spread 
also outside the Calabria region (Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia 
Romagna, Tuscany, Lazio, Aosta Valley). Main activities: 
kidnapping, extortion, drug dealing, real estate investments; 
money-lending and usury, controlling companies. New directions: 
interest in the privatization of some national state-owned 
companies, and companies in the former communist countries. 
Antimafia measures: 12 local councils disbanded. 
  Sacra Corona Unita--Dimensions: 47 associations, 1,775 
members. Main geographical areas: Brindisi, Taranto, and 
Lecce. Main activities: close cooperation with Cosa Nostra, 
Camorra, and 'Ndrangheta in the drugs and arms sectors. 
Antimafia measures: three local councils disbanded, 13 local 
civil servants removed from office. 
  Cosa Nostra--Dimensions: 186 Mafia organizations, 5,000 
members, tens of thousands of flankers. Characteristics: 
rigidly vertical and hierarchical structure; network throughout 
the national territory and links with criminal organizations in 
other countries; marked adaptation to work within institutions; 
massive infiltration in politics, as well as in business, the 
liberal professions, the civil service, and local 
administrations. Main activities: international drug dealing, 
construction and building materials sectors, services and 
agricultural sectors, extortion. New directions: drugs, 
operational agreements with gangs in other regions and foreign 
criminal organizations; spreading the "stidde" [local Mafia 
units] (in fighting against the traditional Mafia), stronger 
presence in the business world and in the administrative fabric. 
Antimafia measures: 17 local councils disbanded, and 17 
councilors removed from office.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Akchurin: "What Is the Cost of Opium for the </F>
People Today?"] 
  [Text] Osh Oblast--A group of police officials from the CIS 
republics, Central Asian republics primarily, recently traveled 
across the ocean to visit their American colleagues. They were 
not simply guests, however, and were attending an international 
seminar organized by the United States Department of Justice on 
the war against drugs. 
  The hosts had gone to considerable expense here. And "our 
people" were curious to find out from them: Why? What is this to 
you? The answer was completely pragmatic: "It is more beneficial 
to us," the Americans explained, "to teach you how to properly 
fight this plague in your own territory, before it comes 
crashing down on us." 
  The organizers of the seminar were not exaggerating the 
scope 
of the danger. Experts have already seized narcotics prepared 
from "our" drug raw material in Washington and Los Angeles. As 
far as hemp alone is concerned--known to Americans as 
"marijuana"--there is enough in the sadly renowned Chu Valley to 
get millions of people hooked! 
  It is not for naught that the ancient healers of the East 
believed that a single herb could be both medicine and poison. 
And there is a great deal of it growing on the slopes of Pamir 
and Tian-Chan. The opium poppy is widely known, for example. Or 
the less well-known, inconspicuous grass from which drug 
specialists have recently become good at quickly and simply 
extracting narcotics with an almost instantaneous habit-forming 
effect... 
  For Tajikistan, which has suffered so much, the drug 
business 
today constitutes a "second front." And it is still not known 
which enemy is more terrible. At the very least doctors assert 
that drugs may be taking more human lives than bullets in the 
warring republic. 
  Perhaps the saddest thing is the fact that many Tajiks, 
people from Gornyy Badakhshan in particular, are entirely 
unaware that they are involved in a deadly trade. After all, 
they say, they used to smoke opium. But whereas they used to 
smoke "for pleasure," today they are engaged in the extraction 
and resale of drugs for one reason only--to make their 
livelihood. Incidentally, the highest people in the drug 
business almost never smoke themselves--a clear head is required 
to achieve their aims. Mafia groups obtain weapons, gold, and 
foodstuffs in short supply in exchange for drugs. In Khorog they 
ferry girls and sell children to mujahidin for opium from 
Afghanistan. In their pursuit of big money, the narcomafia will 
resort to anything, even including armed conflict. What was a 
small drug flow stream, alas, is gathering the force of a mud 
torrent, a very alarming phenomenon, and is pouring through a 
single mountain corridor--the Khorog-Osh road. Simple mountain 
dwellers are being dragged into the criminal trade, people who 
today do not have anything to live on. 
  "The absence of sociopolitical regulation and inability of 
the central authorities to control the situation in the 
localities are creating ideal conditions for a prosperous drug 
trade," states Colonel A. Orozov, head of the National Security 
Directorate for Osh Oblast. "Afghan peasants are refusing to 
grow anything except the opium poppy, which affords a fantastic 
profit. Understanding the danger that is emanating from its 
neighbors, Iran is prepared to build a virtual `Great Wall of 
China' along its border, and has allocated millions in 
appropriations to fight this evil. Military operations have 
impeded drug passage in the direction of Dushanbe. So there 
remains only the road to Osh for the marketing of narcotics. 
Available current-operations data indicate that along the border 
with Gornyy Badakhshan, eight tonnes of raw opium are awaiting 
transfer across the Pamirs to Osh." 
  "We must not lose sight of the premises that created the 
conditions for trade development," Colonel Orozov continues. 
"Many people in Gornyy Badakhshan have no opportunity to find 
work." 
  At the June session of the Gornyy Badakhshan Oblast Soviet, 
one woman--a people's deputy--stated from the floor of the 
chamber that she had been forced to engage in the resale of 
narcotics since she was entirely unable to feed her large 
family. Local residents buy opium at R100 per gram and sell it 
for R500. In Osh they are "driving up" the price of the 
dangerous plant to R1,500. This figure is doubled or tripled in 
the near and far abroad. Osh is being transformed into a 
powerful drug center. But the men from Khorog openly admit that 
they have lost the battle with the drug mafia and are now 
placing all their hopes in collective counteraction on the part 
of near and far neighbors. 
  Is such counteraction possible? The judgments of our recent 
past are becoming ever more unflattering. But even our former 
ideological enemies, now our partners, admit: The Soviet state 
kept its borders so tightly sealed that passage of the "white 
product" was virtually reduced to naught. Drugs used to 
circumvent one-sixth of the Earth's surface. 
  Today the situation has changed. According to Interpol data, 
Colombian drugs have already blazed a trail to Europe across the 
vital border of the CIS. And indeed, they have enough problems 
even as far as their own "home-grown" sources are concerned. At 
a regional seasonal conference of specialists in the war against 
the drug mafia and drug trade out of the Central Asian republics 
held in Dzhambul (Kazakhstan), representatives from Tajikistan 
asserted that the flow of drugs has increased through their 
sector of the border. There you get a truck load of food for 10 
kilograms of opium. And just try to interfere when 
transportation of the product across the border is carried out 
under cover of fire from arms on the other side. The bygone days 
of protection of Soviet borders was only bad in that all of us 
together and each of us individually now find ourselves 
unprepared to defend ourselves against a well organized and 
experienced enemy--the drug trade. Special subdivisions in 
Kazakhstan, for example, engaged in patrolling the 
above-mentioned Chu Valley, are suffering from elementary 
problems: insufficient supply of binoculars, night-vision 
devices, handcuffs (!), means of transportation, and fuel. 
  Worst of all is the fact that it is sometimes the law itself 
that stands in the way of safeguarding the law. Throughout the 
civilized world there exists the concept of "shipments under 
surveillance." When they obtain drug-related information, 
experts in the war against drugs do not rush to catch criminals 
red-handed. It is important to follow the entire chain of 
movement of the "white death"--to where it is headed, for whom 
it is intended. But the procuracy in Kazakhstan prohibits such 
action, considering it provocative. 
  "As a result we content ourselves with catching the little 
fish, while the sharks of the drug trade remain lurking in the 
shadows," admits A. Vyborov, chief of the department for 
fighting the illegal drug trade of the Kazakhstan Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. 
  In neighboring Kyrgyzstan, although a national program has 
been adopted to fight the drug mafia, the lack of qualified 
cadre and shortages of technical assets and financing remain a 
serious problem. 
  Perhaps only in the Republic of Uzbekistan have they been 
able to mobilize force against this phenomenon, where President 
I. Karimov has long and persistently been addressing from every 
forum--including the United Nations--the formidable danger of a 
wave of narcotics across Central Asia. 
  Those who make superficial judgments from afar as to the 
causes and consequences of the Tajik conflict should now ponder 
a response to the question: What is the cost of opium for the 
people today? After all, the Pamirs are far closer to Moscow and 
the outskirts of the CIS than they are to Los Angeles.

<F P=106> [Sergey Prokopenko article under "Postscript: Events and </F>
Commentaries" rubric: "`To Halt Criminal Aggression.' This Was 
How Viktor Yerin Described the Chief Task of the Russian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs"] 
  [Text] The thesis that the accumulation of initial capital 
has always been criminal everywhere has been proved by life. 
You have only to look at the realities of our market existence 
today: The pages of the daily papers are literally full of 
reports of thefts, robberies, and shoot-outs. 
  In the past analysts predicted that individual criminal 
groupings would start consolidating themselves, dividing up 
spheres of influence, strengthening international ties, bribing 
officials, and politicizing themselves. It is obvious now that 
this phenomenon has outgrown the criminal framework and become a 
real threat to the state's security, jeopardizing Russia's 
political and economic development. 
  There is quite a lot of evidence of this. Thus, in the 
opinion of specialists, economic elements are increasingly 
frequently entering the sphere of interests of criminal 
structures, and the credit and banking system is being 
undermined. Between 70 and 80 percent of privatized enterprises 
are already the victims of extortion, and most commercial banks 
in the capital and in Russia are under the control of criminal 
groupings. 
  Another aspect of the problem is the fact that organized 
crime poses a threat to the already weak legal policy. I have 
already spoken of the trend toward its politicization. This 
means that criminal elements are being enabled to influence the 
adoption of particular decrees and laws through corrupt 
officials and politicians. Incidentally, during the first half 
of last year alone employees of law-enforcement organs put a 
stop to 8,800 official crimes, and 40 percent more instances of 
bribery were also stopped. According to the analysts' 
conclusions, the mafia's influence over the disposition of 
political forces will increase. 
  These are the gloomy forecasts, and yet, according to the 
official data of the Russian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], 
although the crime situation remains complex and the growth of 
crime is increasing, it is already possible to speak of a 
reduction in the rate of growth. The clear-up rate for crimes, 
including economic crimes, is also improving--which has made it 
possible to return 1.688 trillion rubles to the state. 
  Army General Viktor Yerin cited these data in his report at 
the all-Russia conference-seminar of leading personnel of 
internal affairs and internal troop organs, which opened in 
Moscow 8 February. The minister of internal affairs dwelt in 
detail on the results of internal affairs organs' operational 
service activity during 1993. 
  The minister named as particularly alarming trends the 
growth 
in the dynamics of serious criminal infringements, the increase 
in drug trafficking, the growing scale of weapon thefts, and the 
unprecedented rampant corruption. 
  As though confirming his words, news came of the 7 February 
confiscation of 5.618 kg of dry opium from operators in the 
drugs business by employees of the capital's Internal Affairs 
Main Administration and the Russian MVD. 
  "We will not make progress along the path of reforms unless 
we launch a determined offensive against crime," Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Government, emphasized in 
his address to the conference. He reported that a federal 
program to combat crime in Russia in 1994-1995 has been prepared 
and will be adopted in the very near future. The head of 
government particularly noted the importance of adopting a new 
legislative base, as the previous one is obsolete and does not 
meet the demands of the times. 
  Well, can the "beloved city" now sleep tight? For the news 
is reassuring, you might say. But it is right here that a doubt 
arises. For all this is already painfully familiar: to 
"mount," "broaden," "deepen...." I recall how as long ago as 
January last year the president announced the start of a 
"frontal offensive against crime." The federal program for 
combating crime was to have been submitted to the Security 
Council for approval before 1 October 1993. But it is already 
1994.... 
  While the upper echelons are bestirring themselves, the 
lower 
echelons can no longer live in the old way. Thus, a department 
to combat racketeering has been set up under the All-Russia 
Association of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. In short, the 
"drowning" people have decided to save themselves....

<F P=106> [Article by Agita Berzina: "Number of Drug Addicts Rising in </F>
Latvia"] 
  [Text] Riga, 29 Jan -- The death rate among drug addicts in 
Latvia has increased, the number of drug-related crimes and the 
number of drug seizures have also risen, and drugs which were 
previously not available have now appeared on the streets of our 
country--such were the gloomy facts given to journalists today 
by Janis Stradins, the chief drug expert at the Health 
Department. 
  The most worrying fact--confirmed by statistical data on the 
problem of drug abuse in Latvia--is the high death rate from 
willful drug indulgence, explained J. Stradins. 
  Last year, 47 drug addicts died, in 1992--27 died, in 
1991--nine. Most of them died from drug overdoses. In 20 
cases, experts could not determine precisely which drug had 
caused death since several narcotics had been used 
simultaneously. 
  The number of crimes related to drug use, storage, and 
trafficking has also increased. In 1993, 269 people were 
prosecuted on criminal charges, in 1992--156. Last year, 320 
drug dens were discovered, in 1992--210. 
  The quantity of confiscated drugs is also rising. Last year, 
166.2 kg of poppy straw were confiscated, in 1992--114.8 kg. 
Given our circumstances, these are the most dangerous cases, 
stated J. Stradins, because addicts, by using relatively simple 
technology, can extract heroin from the straw. At present, the 
greatest share of drugs reaching Latvia come from Lithuania, 
Russia, and southern Ukraine. Thus, poppies from the south, 
containing more heroin than locally grown ones, are making their 
way into Latvia. 
  Another substance widely used by addicts is efedron, which 
is 
extracted from medicine already containing the narcotic. It is 
a very effective drug which creates distinct addiction. Heroin 
is usually injected one to three times a day, whereas it is 
necessary to inject efedron as many as 15 times a day. 
  Marijuana and hashish are being found less and less 
frequently. But, as J. Stradins stated, there is presumably 
still quite a considerable volume of trade in these substances. 
  The most alarming aspect today is the appearance of cocaine. 
The appearance of this drug is linked primarily with the 
stabilization of the lat, and there is good reason to think that 
when the lat becomes convertible, it will be possible to 
purchase any drug in any amount throughout Latvia. 
  A letter has been sent to the prime minister, in which he 
was 
asked to support the operation "Poppy," similar to one that was 
organized in 1987, when the growing of poppy was outlawed, 
reported J. Stradins. In those times, local authorities used to 
organize campaigns to destroy them. Taking into account the 
present situation in Latvia, a similar action is now being 
planned. Stradins said: We understand we cannot gain much by 
restrictions, but to some extent it is a cry of despair. 
  Data from Riga police and the Ministry of Home Affairs 
suggest that there might be between 2,500 and 6,000 drug users 
in Latvia. According to J. Stradins, these numbers are more 
close to reality than the number of addicts estimated by the 
medical service--800. 
  The most unfavorable situation is in Olaine, also in the 
district of Riga, in Riga itself (mainly in the suburb of 
Latgale), Ogre, Jurmala, and Tukums. 
  Drug abuse is widespread mostly among "Russian speakers," as 
well as among people from the Caucasus, and Gypsies. Between 80 
and 90 percent of addicts receiving medical help are Russian 
speakers. 
  The most important element in the fight against drugs is 
prevention, as was stressed by all members of the conference 
[not further identified]. It is more effective than any control. 
Therefore the news that an agreement has been reached with the 
Scandinavian organization "Parents Against Drugs" to hold their 
plenary meeting in Riga on 25 February, with the aim of 
establishing a similar organization in Latvia, is very 
encouraging. The experience of these states shows clearly that 
parents can help their children much more, if they have met, 
discussed their problems together, and exchanged experiences.

  [Text] Vilnius police detained three persons in a city 
apartment where they discovered and confiscated a kilogram of 
opium.... This is the largest amount of narcotic substances, 
worth almost $10,000, that has been detected in Lithuania. Over 
the last year, the police found 663 grams of illegally kept 
opium. According to medical people, opium is the most 
widespread drug in Lithuania. Narcotics are supposed to arrive 
in Lithuania from Asian countries. There are attempts to transit 
drugs through Lithuania as well. While inspecting a passenger 
train in Kybartai recently, customs officers confiscated five 
kilograms of ground poppy heads from three Russian citizens. 
Three Ukrainian residents were found carrying 32 kilograms of 
narcotic substances by car at the Latezeris customs house.

<H5>  Argentina </H5>
  Dangerous Drugs Superintendency agents on 11 February 
arrested five drug traffickers with 13 kg of cocaine and various 
weapons in Buenos Aires' La Paternal neighborhood. (Buenos Aires 
NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2226 GMT 11 Feb 94) 
  Federal Police arrested a drug trafficker carrying 2,000 
doses of cocaine hidden in stickers during an operation in a 
video game room in the Constitution Railway Station, Buenos 
Aires. (Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 1507 GMT 12

<H5>  Bolivia </H5>
  The Santa Cruz Special Antinarcotics Force, FELCN, regional 
command arrested former FELCN agents Walter Orellana and Freddy 
Hurtado on charges of extorting huge amounts of money from small 
drug traffickers and coca growers for more than two years. 
(Santa Cruz LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p A7) 
<H5>  Brazil </H5>
  Police reported the seizure of 45 kg of cocaine at 2 de Maio 
ranch, 30 km from Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, and the arrest 
of a Beninese citizen, who confessed that he bought the drug to 
ship it to Nigeria hidden in exhaust pipes. According to 
police, a new route is being used by the Colombian and Bolivian 
cartels to transport the drug through Brazil. The drug enters 
the country at Ponta Pora, then is transported to Dourados, 
where it is hidden in spare parts of cars. The cocaine then 
leaves Mato Grosso do Sul on the main highway to Sao Paulo. 
Police believe that drug traffickers use ELP Trade and Export 
Company, headquartered in Sao Paulo, as a front to export 
cocaine to Nigeria. (Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo Television in 
Portuguese 2200 GMT 14 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Peru </H5>

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional drug seizures and arrests related to drug 
trafficking monitored through 20 February. Source is cited in 
parentheses following each item. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  Police forces confiscated 200 kg of cocaine on 12 February 
in 
the Departments of Valle del Cauca and El Quindio. The drug was 
going to be shipped to Europe and the United States. Twelve 
suspected drug traffickers, apparently members of the Cali 
Cartel, were arrested and are under investigation. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 14 Feb 94 p 9) 
  The Colombian Army discovered a warehouse where chemicals 
used to process cocaine were stored and arrested six members of 
the Cali Cartel. The chemicals included 1,553 gallons of 
hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetone, thinner, alcohol, and 
formol, and 2.5 tons of magnesium carbonate, activated coal, 
sodium sulfate, and sodium bicarbonate. The Army estimated the 
value of the chemicals to be $1.2 million. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 1809 GMT 17 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Costa Rica </H5>
  Colombian citizen Gildardo Baquero was arrested on 9 
February 
at the Juan Santamaria Airport while trying to bring 4.5 kg of 
cocaine into the country. Baquero, 33, had arrived from San 
Andres, Colombia. (San Jose LA NACION in Spanish 10 Feb 94 p 
10A) 
<H5>  Dominican Republic </H5>
  The National Drug Control Directorate confirmed that 428.5 
kg 
of pure cocaine from Colombia were confiscated on 12 February. 
The drug was dropped from a light aircraft and was going to be 
shipped to the United States in a launch with a Puerto Rican 
registration number. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2205 GMT 16 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Guatemala </H5>
  Official sources have reported that on 16 February the 
Treasury Police destroyed a marijuana plantation in the northern 
El Peten Department valued at $4.805 million. There were no 
arrests, as the owners managed to escape. According to the same 
sources, during 1993 the Treasury Police confiscated several 
shipments of cocaine, marijuana, poppy plants, and opium worth 
$184.2 million. The report added that 7,223,988 marijuana 
plants were destroyed during that same period. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 2329 GMT 17 Feb 94) 
<H5>  Mexico </H5>
  The Attorney General's Office has reported that on 15 
February Mexican authorities destroyed 2.7 tons of marijuana, 
3,777 psychotropic pills, 8.7 kg of cocaine, 2 kg of heroin, and 
24.2 kg of opium paste. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2309 GMT 15 Feb 
94) 
<H5>  Nicaragua </H5>
  Police authorities in Puerto Cabezas have detected liquid 
cocaine in bottles of rum which are being shipped by air and 
land. According to reports, 108 kg of cocaine from Colombia were 
confiscated in January, and local authorities are worried about 
the increase in drug consumption. (Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 
4 Feb 94 pp 1, 2) 
<H5>  Panama </H5>
  Panamanian citizen Fernando de Leon Jaen was arrested five 
days ago in Anton while carrying several weapons and an 
undetermined amount of cocaine. Although it was initially 
reported that he carried 7 kg of cocaine, other sources said "he 
only had a few grams." The weapons confiscated were a 
submachine gun, one shotgun, and two revolvers. (Panama City EL 
PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 16 Feb 94 p 9A) 
<H5>  Peru </H5>
  Army patrols destroyed five cocaine labs in Campanilla, San 
Martin, 750 km northeast of Lima in the jungle area of Alto 
Huallaga, the police reported on 19 February. No one was 
arrested during the operation, as the occupants managed to flee.

the presence of U.S. military forces in Latin America by 
Bolivian Senator Andres Solis Rada in La Paz, former Venezuelan 
Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich in Caracas, retired 
Ecuadoran Division General Richelieu Levoyer in Quito, Peruvian 
General Sinecio Jarama in Lima, and Colombian General Gabriel 
Puyana in Santa Fe de Bogota, with moderator Eduardo Lozano at 
the Santa Fe de Bogota Radio Cadena Nacional studios in Santa Fe 
de Bogota--live] 
  [Text] [Lozano] Lately, agreements and pacts that 
governments have signed with the United States have basically 
allowed U.S. military forces, including military engineers and 
some technicians, to visit countries in the region to teach or 
to work on construction projects. Colombia is no exception, and 
currently the presence of U.S. military forces in this country 
has generated a strong dispute between the State Council and 
President Cesar Gaviria. What do Latin American countries think 
of the U.S. military presence in our nations? Let us recall 
that not long ago in Paraguay and Uruguay, senators reacted 
against the presence of U.S. technicians in their countries. 
Let us immediately begin to learn the viewpoint of each nation. 
Let us begin with La Paz, Bolivia. Welcome Juan Jose Hidalgo. 
  [Hidalgo] Thanks, Eduardo. Good morning, Latin America. The 
presence of U.S. troops in Latin America has raised concern and 
has prompted various responses. In Bolivia, they use the word 
technicians, even the word doctors, to avoid direct reference to 
the U.S. military regarding the presence of U.S. military units. 
To deal with this issue, we have invited Senator Andres Solis 
Rada, who is among those who have strongly criticized the U.S. 
military presence in Bolivia. Senator Solis will give us his 
opinion regarding the current situation in Bolivia. Senator, 
130 million Latin Americans are listening to you. Good morning. 
  [Solis] Good morning, and a Bolivarian greeting to my Latin 
American brothers. We believe that the systematic presence of 
the U.S. Armed Forces in our countries is the result of the 
existence of a new U.S. strategic doctrine regarding Latin 
American countries. That doctrine is called the new world order, 
and it was outlined by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan [as 
heard] immediately after the U.S. invasion of Panama on 20 
December 1989. 
  According to the new world order, concepts such as 
sovereignty, nation, armed forces, dignity, patriotism, or 
borders are obsolete terms. This doctrine comprises both a 
pretext and a practical reality. The pretext is the fight 
against drug trafficking. We believe that if the United States 
truly wants to eliminate drug trafficking, it can achieve this 
goal very in a short time--I would say two or three weeks. How? 
It can simply control the laundering of $3 or $4 billion by 
international banks. Instead of controlling the banks, however, 
the United States has opted to send military forces with the 
illusory goal of catching mosquitoes with boxing gloves. The 
biggest drug traffickers are not in the jungles, but in New 
York's skyscrapers or in the modern buildings of Latin American 
capitals. Therefore, this is all a great pretext. 
  We believe their primary objective is the occupation of the 
Amazonian region. According to the developed countries, the 
Amazonian region is one of the world's lungs, but from the 
Eurocentric viewpoint, humanity only includes Europeans and 
white North Americans. According to this outlook, the Amazonian 
region does not belong to Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Venezuela, 
Ecuador, or Colombia, but to them. They are seeking to rule the 
world with ideas that date back to 200 years ago--the ideas of 
Adam Smith or Thomas Robert Malthus. 
  To illustrate my point, I will recall that in May 1992, 400 
U.S. engineers, who were specialists in troop landings, arrived 
in Bolivia. The odd part was that to justify their presence, it 
was argued that they were coming to repair schools and dig 
latrines. These schools and latrines cost $20,000, while 
providing transportation for these 400 U.S. engineers rang in at 
$8 million. Therefore, they are clearly not coming to build 
latrines or schools; they are getting ready to occupy the 
Amazonian area, especially the Brazilian part, where there is 
the greatest opposition to this policy. 
  Their second goal is to get people used to the presence of 
foreign troops. Before I conclude, I cannot overlook the 
occupation of our countries by police forces. We have denounced 
the fact that Bolivia's major cities--La Paz, Cochabamba, and 
Santa Cruz--are patrolled 24 hours a day by agents under the 
command of Bolivian officials and who also work for the U.S. 
Government. Their vehicles have license plates that belong to 
international cooperation or intelligence services. In the end, 
if we remain passive regarding this situation, we will soon 
become colonies with a parliament and a flag, but the parliament 
and the flag will merely be a facade to cover this intervetion. 
Nevertheless, a slave who realizes his slavery begins to be 
free. Let us realize this situation of dependence to be loyal 
to Simon Bolivar's legacy and resist the very tense situation we 
are currently living. This is our viewpoint from La Paz, 
Bolivia. 
  [Hidalgo] Thank you Senator Andres Solis Rada. You have 
heard 
the senator's position, which strongly questions the U.S. 
military presence in Bolivian territory. Back to you, Eduardo 
Lozano. 
  [Lozano] Juan Jose, I really appreciate your report from La 
Paz, Bolivia. What are the thoughts in Venezuela? What are the 
Venezuelan people's ideas on whether or not they agree with the 
U.S. military presence? Caracas, welcome Elsy Verrueta: 
  [Verrueta] Many thanks, Eduardo Lozano, and good morning to 
all our Latin American listeners. The topic has been a matter of 
controversy in our country in the past. The possibility that 
U.S. military forces could come to Venezuela arose emerged and 
it became the task of Division General Fernando Ochoa Antich to 
take charge of the problem. First, he was defense minister and 
then foreign minister until 2 February. He is our guest and he 
is going to give us his opinion and how he handled the 
situation. Of course, we also want to hear his opinion about the 
possibility that U.S. troops could remain in some Latin American 
country. Go ahead Gen. Fernando Ochoa Antich, we want to hear 
your opinion. 
  [Ochoa] Many thanks. First, I want to take advantage of this 
extraordinary opportunity to send my cordial greetings to the 
Latin American people listening to us. When I was defense 
minister, I had the great responsibility of negotiating, with 
the United States, agreements for the antinarcotic radars. 
Venezuela was very firm in the position we presented to the U.S. 
negotiators, and we managed to convince them this was not 
possible in Venezuela because of a basic feeling or principle 
among Venezuelans of not accepting foreign troops under any 
circumstance, even though they were unarmed. 
  Venezuelans would not accept, under any circumstance, that 
the radars be handled by U.S. troops. If this point was not 
amendable, then these radars could simply not be located in 
Venezuela, with all the consequences this would have had for the 
struggle against drug trafficking. We managed to convince the 
United States; they understood the Venezuelan position and 
fortunately an agreement was reached whereby the radars are 
operated entirely by the Venezuelan Armed Forces. 
  This is a very strong feeling, both among Venezuelans as 
well 
as Latin Americans. I really cannot understand how Latin 
American Governments can accept foreign troops in their 
country--mainly U.S. troops--behind the back of the people, even 
though these troops need not be involved in any military 
activity. This is a problem of nationalism, which is deeply 
entrenched among Latin Americans because of our sad history of 
colonialism. That is why we and the people have always rejected 
this. This, despite the fact that current relations with the 
United States are much more constructive than relations based on 
Marine invasions. None of our people can accept the presence of 
foreign troops in our country due to our concept of liberty, 
which is so very much a part of our feeling. 
  Another very basic point, which was discussed very 
intelligently by the Bolivian senator, is the interest in the 
drug-trafficking problem. The U.S. interest toward our countries 
right now, aside from the permanent interest in raw materials, 
is simply to do with drug trafficking. There are two very 
complex problems. One, their interest that our Armed Forces 
direct the work to fight drug trafficking. I have maintained a 
doctrinal position on this. The Latin American countries' Armed 
Forces cannot be used against drug trafficking because the 
corruption capacity of drug trafficking would force the Armed 
Forces to lose their main capacity as institutions intended to 
defend our countries and sovereignty. Therefore, this is a 
position that Venezuela has also maintained very firmly by 
rejecting the idea that our Armed Forces be used to fight drug 
trafficking. 
  We accept that the National Guard, which is part of the 
Armed 
Forces but tasked mainly as an administrative police, can be 
used for this. In no way, however, will we accept the 
involvement of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force in fighting 
drug trafficking because this would change the main purpose of 
our Armed Forces. The third point, which I believe is very 
important and which I will stress, is that the struggle against 
drug trafficking cannot be successful until consumption in 
developed countries is controlled, as it should be. This is a 
fight which these countries must face because while the drug 
trafficking business remains so productive, this struggle is 
simply a loss of time, even though we are fighting. In this 
respect, I admire the people of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, who 
are waging an all-out war against drug trafficking, with a lot 
of sacrifice. 
  The fact of the matter is that until consumption is not 
checked and until money laundering is not controlled, we simply 
cannot be successful in our struggle against drug trafficking. 
  [Verrueta] Thank you Gen. Fernando Ochoa Antich for your 
valuable opinion. We return once more to Eduardo Lozano. 
  [Lozano] Thank you Gen. Ochoa for your participation in this 
special program. Now we are with Jorge Ivan Melo, in Quito. 
  [Melo] Thank you, Eduardo. Greetings to our 130 million 
listeners throughout Latin America. 
  In 1987 in Ecuador, the Ecuadoran and U.S. Armies signed an 
understanding memorandum to allow military maneuvers and works 
in support of the civilian population. This resulted in the 
construction of a road that according to budget figures should 
have been 57 km long. Only 2,200 meters were built. 
  We invited retired General Richelieu Levoyer to discuss 
this. 
He has been government minister, general commander of the Army, 
and a deputy. Currently, he is the president of Omidelac, 
Organization of Military Men for Democracy and the Integration 
of Latin America and the Caribbean. 
  General, what has been the result of the U.S. military 
presence in Ecuador? 
  [Levoyer] Thank you. First I want to cordially greet the 
Latin American community, which is very concerned about this 
very important issue. I can say the Ecuadoran people have always 
been opposed to the presence of U.S. troops in our territory. 
These troops sometimes come to build roads but the fact is we 
have excellent military and civilian engineers who can do this 
work. 
  We also find it strange that U.S. troops have to come here 
to 
build one, two, or three small schools in the countryside. This 
is something our civil engineers, who can rely on the 
cooperation of the teachers, can do perfectly well. Why then 
must troops, and not civil engineers and technicians, come here 
to build roads or schools? 
  In any event, the clearest evidence of the Ecuadoran 
people's 
position on the presence of U.S. troops in our country took 
place in 1987. I was a congressional deputy at the time. In 
March of 1987, there was a tremor that destroyed an interior 
road in our country's Amazon region, the Baeza-La Guagrio road, 
leaving approximately 100,000 people isolated. 
  The U.S. Army and our government reached an agreement called 
Opening Routes. Based on this agreement, the U.S. Army would 
open an alternate 57 km long road going through the towns of 
Ollin, Loreto, and Coca. A total of 6,000 soldiers, arriving in 
groups of 600, came to the country to do the work in six months. 
The performance of this task force, the U.S. 1169 Task Force, 
was, to say the least, lacking. As a member of the congressional 
commission charged with overseeing the work of the U.S. troops, 
I personally confirmed that they built only 2,200 km 
[measurement as heard] of road. 
  [Melo] General, the Bolivian senator and some Ecuadoran 
analysts have said the U.S. military wants to learn about Latin 
America's geography to put pressure on the jungle areas and to 
familiarize the people with U.S. troops so a future invasion is 
not seen as odd. How true could this be? 
  [Levoyer] I agree with what Bolivian Senator Andres Solis 
Rada said. The 1987 event confirms his statement. That year I 
personally spoke with Lieutenant Colonel Powell, the commander 
of the U.S. group that came to build the alternate road in the 
Amazon region, and he emphatically and carelessly told me the 
U.S. objective had been accomplished: the training of U.S. 
soldiers in a jungle area like ours. He told me the U.S. troops 
had become accustomed to performing in this type of environment. 
  Regarding the objectives of cooperation with and the 
transferal of technology to our military engineers, these 
objectives failed because equipment was lost, the soldiers did 
not know the river flow variances, their equipment sank in humid 
regions, and they could not work well. 
  [Melo] We thank retired General Levoyer for his 
participation 
in this Solar program. Now we go back to Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  [Lozano] Thank you. We will now contact Dennis Vargas, in 
Lima. What do Peruvians think about the involvement of U.S. 
military forces in aid programs? Go ahead Dennis. 
  [Vargas] Latin America's tradition has been that of 
defending 
the principles of nonintervention and sovereignty. This should 
be clearly established in international law. American or North 
American doctrine on international law better outlines these 
principles. In the specific case of drug trafficking, we would 
have to analyze the situation. Legislative Branches are always 
concerned about respect for the legal framework of fighting drug 
trafficking in the various countries, especially in Bolivia, 
Peru, and Colombia. Some concepts put international law in 
danger when there is meddling. 
  Our guest today is General Sinecio Jarama. We are asking 
him, as part of the Solar network, about the U.S. military 
presence in Peru or how much of a presence there was before and 
what can he tell us about the topic. What is the role of U.S. 
soldiers or military engineers in our countries? Over 100 
million Latin Americans are listening to you. 
  [Jarama] I would first like to thank you for this 
invitation. 
I also wish to send greetings to those 100 million Latin 
Americans listening to the Solar System. Getting into the topic 
of whether U.S. troops should be in our countries, it is worth 
noting first that this has been and remains a permanent concern 
for all Latin Americans, both civilians and military personnel. 
Second, it is also worth noting that in Peru there has been 
adamant opposition to the authorization of the presence of 
foreign troops in our territory. Whenever this has happened, or 
whenever there have been complaints about it, the people or 
various political or social sectors have reacted by demanding an 
explanation, and the appropriate authorities have explained the 
matter. Third, I also want to point out that the presence of 
foreign troops is addressed in the constitutions of all our 
countries. This is not a decision or whim on the part of the 
Pentagon or the U.S. Administration. Our constitutions give 
specific details of the measures to be followed, the steps to be 
taken, or the institutions to be consulted when a foreign 
country wants to bring its troops into our territories. This is 
also a problem that involves the exercise of our sovereignty. 
The president and his military advisers normally handle such 
matters. In addition, the respective legislatures must be asked 
for their authorization; that is, the countries' respective 
legislatures. That is where the exercise of our sovereignty 
comes in. I must also say, however, that over the past four 
decades, from the 1950's until now, the United States, through 
its military offices or military attache offices, has maintained 
relations with our military forces. These relations have 
allowed the development of cooperation programs, which are 
basically military training programs that have entailed joint 
actions by combined U.S.-Peruvian forces. There are also 
programs like Operation Unitas. There are other programs that 
are part of the training of U.S. reserve troops, which is the 
case with the troops in Panama. They come with engineer 
battalions, conduct training exercises, and leave behind some 
benefit for the community. 
  [Vargas] Thank you, Gen. Jarama, for being with us on the 
Solar network. We are returning to Santa Fe de Bogota. Eduardo. 
  [Lozano] Thanks, Denis, you are very kind. General Gabriel 
Puyana, our guest today, is a very well-known military man in 
Colombia, and although he has retired already, he is a true 
Colombian. We only have a minute, General. We would like to 
hear your opinion as a military member and a Colombian regarding 
the presence of foreign troops--in this case, U.S. soldiers--in 
Colombia. 
  [Puyana] Thanks to Radio Cadena Nacional and the Solar 
Network. Since I only have a minute, I will be clear and 
concise. I was able to hear part of what the other guests have 
said on this program, and basically I agree with them. 
  A distinction must be made, especially with the current 
controversy in Colombia, between troops being in a country on a 
temporary or permanent basis. The Inter-American Reciprocal 
Assistance Treaty signed in 1947 has been mentioned here. We 
must recall that Colombia participated in Korea. However, we 
must differentiate between technical advisers, who teach and 
help facilitate learning about new and sophisticated equipment, 
and regular troops, because the latter causes wariness and 
rejection. 
  But there are different viewpoints about this issue. People 
in those isolated areas, who have been systematically and long 
forgotten by various governments, are satisfied because their 
urgent needs are somewhat relieved. But let's not confuse the 
issue. We cannot think that a military attache in another 
country implies a foreign military presence in that territory. 
The Peruvian General has discussed this already. These are two 
different situations. 
  In addition, our histories give us certain obligations. If 
there are two countries that must assume dignified attitudes, 
setting aside the pragmatism of convenience, they are Mexico and 
Colombia. We must only recall Theodore Roosevelt and how Panama 
was taken away from Colombia. We were definitely better off, 
because it is as if one's arm is cut off [words indistinct], it 
is better to cut off the arm as it happened to Colombia. We 
were better off that another country, Panama, had to bear all 
that it has had to tolerate and will tolerate in this unending 
century. That is why I believe the presence of armed forces--to 
be specific, logistics and operational units--should not be 
accepted. 
  There is some background to this issue. For example, there 
was an operation here called America 1962. We must clarify that 
there is a difference between technicians who teach and help and 
troops who are here on a permanent basis. 
  Regarding the recent controversy, the problem arose 
basically 
due to a mishandling of information. It was very sad for 
Colombia--and I say this as a Colombian--that we had to learn 
about the entire episode through a statement by the ambassador 
as if this were a unilateral decision by the Pentagon. It was 
disgraceful. There has been a lack of information and 
misinformation. I want to reiterate that this is my personal 
opinion: I am not quoting anyone. As a Colombian, I do not 
approve of U.S. soldiers being here and doing things that we can 
do ourselves. 
  [Lozano] Many thanks, Gen. Puyana, you have been very kind.

  [Text] National Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz has 
noted that despite a huge effort by Bolivia in the field of 
interdiction of drug trafficking and eradication of coca crops, 
illegal narcotics trafficking has increased during the past few 
years. 
  During the opening ceremony of the first subregional 
cooperation meeting of representatives from Argentina, Bolivia, 
Chile, and Peru, Mario Soliz said he hopes effective policies 
for trafficking control will be established. 
  During the first session of this meeting, which will last 
until 3 February, the Bolivian Government raised two programs 
that represent the basis for the alternative development 
strategy: the opening of export markets and the establishment of 
a Subregional Fund for Alternative Development [Fondo 
Subregional Para el Desarrollo Alternativo]. National 
International Relations Secretary Jaime Aparicio said the 
Bolivian Government is committed to combating drug trafficking, 
its consequences, and one of its main causes: poverty. 
  Soliz explained that the basic task for the four cooperating 
countries is to enhance control and coordination at various 
levels within that broad area of thousands of kilometers of 
shared borders. 
  Soliz said: "There are highways, roads, railways, sea 
routes, 
and airways, which are clandestine routes for drugs, chemicals, 
and precursors. These borders are currently violated by 
criminal drug organizations." 
  In the case of Bolivia, Soliz said, this violation has a 
very 
serious cultural component because coca, a sacred element for 
Bolivians, seriously worries the world when its use does not 
conform to the traditional practices that have been a custom in 
our area for hundreds of years. 
  The social defense secretary said: "Despite efforts by the 
Bolivian Government in the field of drug enforcement, 
eradication of coca crops, and alternative development policy, 
drug trafficking activities have increased." 
  After indicating that Bolivia has achieved significant 
advancements, Soliz noted that 47 percent of the entire coca 
crops existing in 1987 have been eradicated. 
  Soliz added: "Nevertheless, while our country was conducting 
this huge task, supported by international cooperation, the 
international drug cartels attempted to increase the illegal 
crop." 
  Soliz indicated that this subregional meeting of 
representatives of the four participating countries shows the 
responsibility of establishing an alliance against the "deadly 
challenge" posed by trafficking to their governments and 
populations. He said that discussions will focus on all the 
aspects of the drug problem, including the opening of export 
markets for products yielded by the replacement of crops within 
the framework of alternative development and ways to increase 
the effectiveness of interdiction. 
  The social defense secretary said the discussions will also 
involve controls on chemicals trafficking and issues of a 
scientific, moral, and human nature, including the worrisome 
question: Why do people take drugs? 
  National International Relations Secretary Jaime Aparicio 
said the efforts made by the producing countries, like Bolivia, 
are not matched by the international community. 
  Aparicio stressed: "This meeting is part of a drug 
enforcement strategy that views with interest a solution to 
illegal drug production, trade, and abuse. Nevertheless, a 
solution to the causes encouraging these illegal actions should 
also be found."

  [Text] La Paz, 7 Feb (LOS TIEMPOS) -- The government does 
not discard the possibility of buying land off the peasants who 
grow coca in the Chapare and Yungas which are traditional coca 
zones "as a means to finally eradicate all illegal trafficking 
in Bolivia." 
  Government Ministry sources told LOS TIEMPOS on 7 February 
that the project to buy land from the peasants was proposed by 
the government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada during the 
latest meeting of the World Bank Consultative Group for Bolivia 
late last year. 
  The sources said: "This option was proposed by the 
negotiating commission that went to Washington to the 
international community as a start of the Zero Option project." 
  They said the administration is seriously studying the idea 
of buying from the thousands of peasants "their land" used for 
growing coca. 
  The sources added: "The offer of $2,000 for every hectare 
cleared of coca made by the previous government to Chapare 
peasants, with a bonus of $500 per tract of land cleared of coca 
is not an empty proposal." 
  The sources indicated that the government is willing to pay 
up to $2,500 per hectare of coca to each peasant. 
  They added: "This means a farmer with 5,000 hectare for 
example, will have the possibility of getting approximately 
$10,000 per hectare for the land he puts up for sale." [sentence 
as published] 
  President Sanchez de Lozada decided to implement this 
project 
which was labeled "Zero Option" but the project is subject to 
international financing for its implementation in the 
medium-term.

  [Excerpts] A drug trafficker's testimony is the cause of 
controversy in the political arena. The following is a report 
by Mario Espinoza, who will tell us about this and other issues 
such as the bid for the Cotapata-Santa Barbara road construction 
project and the government budget. 
  [Mario Espinoza] The testimony of drug trafficker Meco 
Dominguez, which was reported by the Fides news agency and 
carried by newspapers in La Paz and nationwide, has caused a 
true political earthquake. 
  The MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] has come out to 
defend its party members and former President Paz Zamora by 
stating that [former Interior Minister] Guillermo Capobianco has 
called a news conference this morning in Santa Cruz and is 
willing to subject himself to any investigation. 
  At any rate, we are facing a unique situation because the 
drug trafficker has caused a political earthquake by slandering 
respectable institutions such as the Bank of Santa Cruz. 
  Moreover, MIR President Oscar Eid Franco has denied 
Dominguez' charges. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified anchorwoman] As was reported by Mario 
Espinoza, 
drug trafficker Meco Dominguez has made charges against the 
private banking industry and the Armed Forces. A Fides news 
agency report reads, text, that for the first time a Bolivian 
bank has been charged in alleged involvement in money laundering 
activities. 
  The report adds that the bank, which has connections with 
U.S. and Panamanian banks, obtained the funds from the Colombian 
and Bolivian drug cartels. 
  Moreover, according to what the controversial Meco Dominguez 
told fiscal and police officials, the Monchego regiment has 
become a cocaine manufacturing center. 
  Regarding the alleged money laundering activities conducted 
by the Bank of Santa Cruz, Meco Dominguez alleges he held a 
meeting with bank officials in 1990. He added that in 1989, 
through Juan Carlos Pereira Paz, bank transactions were 
conducted with this gentleman for the cashing of six checks for 
$50,000 each for the Cali cartel.

  [Excerpt] La Paz, 10 Feb (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Army General 
Staff senior officers said on 9 February in La Paz that the 
budget cutback in the drug-trafficking interdiction programs in 
the coca-producing countries announced by the U.S. Government 
"is immaterial to the Bolivian Armed Forces." 
  The military sources told LOS TIEMPOS that this attitude is 
to be understood to the extent that "the Army, the Navy, and the 
Air Force have never actually received these funds." 
  The military sources supported their opinions by pointing 
out 
that the U.S. Army spent more than $5 million in the name of 
Bolivia under the excuse of carrying out civic actions in the 
town of Santa Ana del Yacuma in Beni Department in 1992. 
  The sources noted: "In fact, barely $250,000 was invested in 
building a school that year." 
  In the opinion of our country's military authorities, the 
cutbacks in this year's interdiction programs announced by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's administration "are a result of the 
U.S. Army's mismanagement of economic resources over the past 
few years." [passage omitted]

  [Text] La Paz, 9 Feb (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Coca peasants in 
Cochabamba's tropical region on 9 February in La Paz said 
National Social Defense Secretariat and the Special 
Antinarcotics Force personnel scared their families and 
threatened to carry out actions to eradicate coca crops. 
  Guido Tarqui, national settlers secretary from the Bolivian 
Labor Federation, said that in the past few days the narcotics 
under secretary and a Coca Reduction Directorate (Direco) 
official threatened Chapare peasants, urging them to voluntarily 
eradicate their coca crops. 
  He said the two government officials openly threatened the 
peasants by telling them that "in case they do not follow the 
coca crops eradication plan, the National Social Defense 
Secretariat will begin carrying out direct interdiction actions 
in the area." 
  Tarqui said the two officials announced that more coca 
eradication employees are being taken to Chapare for the purpose 
of eradicating coca crops "by fair means or foul." 
  Tarqui said this attitude intimidates the peasants, which 
may 
lead to "clashes and the spilling of blood." 
  "The peasants are not willing to allow their crops to be 
eradicated without any consideration," Tarqui said, adding that 
"the only means of living for the area's peasants are coca 
leaves."

<F P=106> [Reports by Nicolas Sanabria Garron from La Paz and Luis </F>
Mayan from Cochabamba] 
  [Text] [Nicolas Sanabria Garron] Coca farmers have 
declared themselves in a state of emergency. Coca farmers have 
called for active resistance to avoid the forceful eradication 
of coca farms in the region. 
  (Cibar Victoria), second secretary of the General Trade 
Union 
Confederation of Peasant Workers, reported: 
  [Begin (Cibar Victoria) recording]: In keeping with the 
government's repressive guidelines, the government's repressive 
forces--UMOPAR [Mobile Police Units for Rural Areas] and the 
DEA--on 14 February at 5 a.m. [words indistinct] eradicated five 
hectares of the sacred coca leaf. To conduct this eradication 
operation, the government forces arrested several fellow 
peasants in a violent and savage manner and are keeping them 
incommunicado. [end recording] 
  [Luis Mayan] Farmers from the (Villa Cunari) coca-producing 
farmers cooperative have decided to declare themselves in a 
state of emergency and general mobilization. The following is a 
report by peasant leader Valentin Gutierrez, who reports the 
assembly's conclusions. 
  [Begin Valentin Gutierrez recording] We have decided to put 
in force the self-defense committees and declare ourselves in a 
state of emergency and general mobilization at the grass-roots 
level. 
  This means we will not be responsible for any eventual 
conflict or clash that may be caused by the government's 
repressive forces. 
  The government will be solely responsible for any eventual 
conflict because coca producers have been willing to negotiate 
and have attended all negotiations called by the government. 
Therefore, the government is solely responsible for any 
eventual conflict. [end recording] 
  According to reports supplied to this radio station, we 
reassert that members of DiNaCo [National Coca Control 
Directorate], Direco [Coca Eradication Directorate], UMOPAR, and 
inmates from the Chimore rehabilitation center continue to 
eradicate coca farms by force. These eradication operations are 
being conducted at the (Sebastian Fundador) colony against the 
(Ibircanzana) coca farmers cooperative where, according to 
peasant leaders, there was a clash and tear gas was used.

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies President Guillermo Bedregal 
Gutierrez, who is the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] 
leader, noted yesterday that the announcement of the new U.S. 
drug enforcement strategy will cause political and social 
conflicts in our country. 
  The Chamber of Deputies president said the announcement of a 
reduction in U.S. cooperation in the field of alternative 
development will prompt "dissatisfaction" among coca producers. 
  Bedregal pondered: "We will have a very serious political 
conflict if the crops are reduced just to reduce them, without 
the proper alternative development planning. The poor coca 
producer, who is tied to the crisis in Bolivia, will be hard 
hit." 
  Bedregal wants the announcement handled "with much care," 
but 
announced that the discussions to approve the national budget 
will consider the issue when establishing our country's drug 
enforcement activities. He said the deputies may discuss this 
issue after the carnival adjournment. 
  Guillermo Richter, the Senate Government and Drug 
Trafficking 
Committee chairman, said he agrees that repression mechanisms 
should be "as efficient as possible" to prevent illegal 
activities. 
  Richter said: "I would have liked greater support in 
economic 
and financial terms--not just from the Clinton administration, 
but also from the international community--to help our country 
and other states that are troubled by this scourge promote 
alternative development." 
  The U.S. Government's announcements mainly involve countries 
that produce raw materials to process drugs--like Bolivia which 
produces coca leaves that are traditionally used for medicinal 
purposes, and cocaine. 
  While opinions on the U.S. President's announcement were 
voiced in Congress, executive branch sources linked to this 
issue--the Ministry of Government and the Social Defense 
Secretariat--did not comment. 
  Unofficial sources announced that the government will wait 
for the return of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who went 
to Oruro yesterday, before adopting a position or beginning 
discussions to establish the drug enforcement policy that will 
be implemented in our country.

  [Text] The Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] has reported 
that it has disbanded a gang of swindlers which reportedly 
earned profits totalling about $3 million. This [word 
indistinct] organization has been acting parallel to the FELCN 
for approximately the last four years. 
  This organization had its own informers and its own 
clandestine barracks. Three of the organization's informers 
were arrested. Among them are a former policeman and a former 
FELCN member who had detailed knowledge of the drug traffickers' 
activities. Those arrested have been identified as (Roger 
Gandarillas), (Felix Flores Aldin), and (Walter Orellana). 
(Roger Gandarillas) is reportedly the leader of the 
organization which allegedly was able to swindle about $3 
million from the drug traffickers. 
  This gang, organized after the Colombian drug mafias, was 
made up of people who had detailed knowledge of all drug 
trafficking activities. They had identified all persons 
involved in drug trafficking activities, and their movements. 
  The organization seized drugs but instead of delivering them 
to the proper government organizations, it kept the seized cargo 
for itself and later distributed it. 
  FELCN officials, who added that the investigations continue, 
yesterday invited reporters to one of the properties that was 
seized from this organization. The property is located on 
Francisco Mora Avenue.

<F P=106> [Article by Paulo Sotero] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- The official responsible for 
international drug trafficking control policies at the U.S. 
State Department said last week that his government "is 
seriously and extraordinarily preoccupied with the narcotics 
situation in Brazil." During an interview on 10 February, the 
day after President Bill Clinton announced his National Drug 
Control Strategy, Robert Gelbard, assistant secretary for drug 
trafficking affairs, said that despite "the dramatic increase" 
of drug trafficking activities in Brazil in the past five years 
he "is not sure there is full consciousness in the country about 
the dangerous levels the problem has reached." 
  According to the diplomat, who was the U.S. ambassador to 
Bolivia in the 1980's, Brazil today is--together with Germany, 
Switzerland, and China--one of the biggest suppliers of the 
chemicals used for manufacturing cocaine. The country also has 
become "one of the main routes for the transit of drugs, 
particularly on its way to Africa and Europe." 
  Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso Flecha de 
Lima 
was informed during a recent conversation with another 
top-ranking U.S. official that the next annual report on drug 
trafficking the State Department will publish in a couple of 
months will say that during 1993 there was "a relaxation of 
controls" on drug trafficking in the country. Last week the 
ambassador asked the Foreign Ministry to supply him with 
information to reply to these allegations as well as Gelbard's 
public declarations. 
  In Brasilia, official sources recognized that the seizure of 
an increasing volume of cocaine confirms the increase in drug 
trafficking activities in Brazil. "The state's incapacity and 
corruption and the judicial system's inefficiency also have 
limited government actions," an official explained. 
  In any case, Gelbard's remarks were not well-received. 
"These remarks fail to recognize the country's continuous 
efforts to fight drug trafficking in very adverse 
circumstances," said one of the ministers' advisers interested 
in the problem. The official recalled, for instance, that the 
federal government recently created a Special Narcotics 
Secretariat to coordinate the fight on drug trafficking. 
  The Americans should know of the difficulties we are going 
through, another top-ranking official said. He added: "Today 
our Federal Police drug trafficking control programs are almost 
entirely financed by the U.S. Government, which is shameful for 
the country." During the past three years, Washington assigned 
Brazil a yearly amount of nearly $1 million (out of a total of 
$80 million allocated for international cooperation to fight 
drug trafficking). 
  Strictly speaking, Gelbard's remarks do not add anything new 
to what we already know. For the past few years Washington has 
been expressing concern about the expansion of drug trafficking 
activities in the Brazilian and Venezuelan Amazon regions. As 
Gelbard said last week: "Just as in other aspects of its 
economy, Brazil has the capacity to produce a large-scale drug 
trafficking economy." Besides, "it is the only Latin American 
country that manufactures all the products necessary to become 
self-sufficient in narcotics production, from precursors to 
epadu [Brazilian coca plant]." 
  The fight on drug trafficking is one of the issues 
Washington 
wants to discuss during the hemispheric heads of state summit 
the Clinton administration is preparing for September.

<F P=106> [Article by Andre Lozano from Manaus Bureau] </F>
  [Text] The Coordinating Board of Brazilian Amazon Region 
Indian Organizations (Coiab) and the Ibama [Brazilian Institute 
for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources] have 
accused Colombians of fostering the smuggling of fish out of the 
Amazon region into the United States. Both agencies estimate 
that returns on the illegal business with alevins (newly-hatched 
fish) amount to $2.4 million per week. 
  The Pastoral for Indigenous Communities of the Upper 
Solimoes 
contends that former members of the gang of Colombian drug 
kingpin Pablo Escobar, who died recently, might be members of 
the band of fish smugglers. 
  According to Father Joseney Lira, the Colombians leave their 
country through the city of Leticia, enter Brazil through 
Tabatinga, and go to the cities of Atalaia do Norte and Benjamin 
Constant, Amazonas State, using the Javari River. Lira said: 
"Most smuggling occurs in these two municipal districts. The 
Colombians purchase alevins at puny prices and resell them for 
600 real cruzeiros each." 
  The smuggled fish reportedly enter Colombia through Leticia, 
are flown by airplane to Bogota, and then to Miami (United 
States of America). Amazonas PF [federal police] Superintendent 
Mauro Sposito said the smuggled fish are also used to camouflage 
cocaine shipments from Leticia to the United States.

  [Text] Brazilian Army units in the Amazon Region will take 
a more active role in combating the narcotics traffic. Measures 
toward that end are being developed by the Army General Staff. 
Possible actions include the use of Army helicopters to back up 
the work of the Federal Police. Three aircraft are already 
operating in Manaus at the Military Command of Amazonia. In the 
future, a company of those aircraft will be assigned there, as 
the embryo of a future Helicopter Battalion in that region, Army 
sources say.

  [Text] Project Hope, a preventive education program to 
discourage drug abuse developed by the Army's Center for 
Personnel Studies (CEP), has been introduced at 478 Army 
military organizations. According to its researchers, this 
undertaking has proven its viability by showing itself to be a 
program that treats drugs systematically, technically, and 
effectively. Inasmuch as the parameters of the project are still 
evolving, it is likely to propagate itself. This has led to the 
establishment of training courses in primary prevention of drug 
use among young people who are serving their obligatory military 
service in the barracks, the principal universe of their 
activities. This year, provided authorization is obtained from 
the higher echelons of the Army, the project will be introduced 
at the Army's Cadet Preparatory School, the gateway for young 
men who want to enter the Agulhas Negras Academy. In the last 
half of 1993, professors and psychologists from the CEP held a 
practicum for officers from different units of the Military 
Command of the East, in Rio de Janeiro. The purpose was to 
standardize the application of the program in all military units 
of the Army and homogenize the knowledge, procedures, and 
techniques used in primary prevention. This is the first step to 
making a reality of the CEP's proposal as regards its details 
and the positive repercussions leading to its extension into the 
military environment. According to CEP leaders, the primary 
objectives of the project in Rio de Janeiro are: to promote a 
change in young people's attitudes toward drugs, to boost 
feelings of self-esteem, to strengthen the ability to resist 
social pressures, and to help adolescents organize their scale 
of values. The young people in the units where the project has 
functioned have left the barracks armed with information against 
drug abuse. This year, the Army hopes to extend the project to 
other area commands and to the schools that are subordinate to 
the Directorate of Specialization and Extension. 
  The studies that formed that basis for Project Hope, now a 
reality, began in 1987 and ended in 1990, the year when it was 
introduced on an experimental basis, starting with units in Rio 
de Janeiro and at the Agulhas Negras Military Academy, an 
officer training school. The Army Center for Personnel Studies, 
one of the most important of its type in South America, annually 
receives dozens of officers from other countries, who take 
specialized courses in communications and other subjects of 
military interest.

  [Text] Mangueira Hill slum had a tense day on 16 February 
as a result of the war staged by drug traffickers Polegar and 
Manino. The war started while the slum's samba group was 
beginning to parade along Marques de Sapucai Avenue. So far, 
seven people have been killed--three of them belonged to 
Manino's gang and four to his rival Polegar's gang. The 
atmosphere of fear kept the Manguera Hill slum residents off 
their own samba rehearsal ground. Very few of them accompanied 
the vote counting on 16 February to choose the winner of the 
special samba group parade. 
  Some armed men freely circulated around the rehearsal ground 
and the neighboring alleys because there was no police 
patrolling of the slum. An eyewitness, whose identity is being 
kept secret, testified at the 17th Police Precinct (Sao 
Cristovao District) on the war's details. According to the 
witness, Polegar--who controls the part of the slum known as 
Chale--planned to increase his territory as soon as the 
Mangueira Samba Group began parading. He planned to invade 
Manino's area--the one known as Buraco Quente--while everyone 
was attentively watching the samba group's performance during 
the parade. 
  Early on 16 February, 20 Polegar men wearing Civil Police 
jackets invaded the Buraco Quente area and killed three members 
of the rival drug trafficking gang. Manino answered the attack 
early the following morning, when four of Polegar's men were 
found dead.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Out of Control"] </F>
  [Text] Learning of the existence of a Red Command barricade 
right in the middle of Tijuca Forest, Minister of the 
Environment Rubens Ricupero put his finger on one of the most 
serious problems in Rio today. A tree trunk lying on the ground 
near the Borel hillside marks the point beyond which no one can 
enter. This is how a physical assault on the city--i.e., its 
division into two parts, one of them controlled by criminals--is 
sanctioned. 
  For some time now, the Red Command has been establishing 
outposts in the forest reserves. After clearing trees from 
different areas, the bandits can control the entrances to the 
shantytowns [favelas] by installing observation posts 
in the trees. The clearings also serve as miniature 
concentration camps where enemies can be tortured and executed. 
A few months ago, the police broke up an encampment in Tijuca 
Forest where traffickers from the Andarai, Divineia, and Casa 
Branca hills used to meet to outline plans for distributing 
drugs. But when the police leave, the traffickers return. 
  By demarcating autonomous territories, preferably inside the 
favelas, and setting parameters for behavior, the 
outlaws have challenged this society directly. The authorities 
must not continue to stand idly by while shantytowns spread out 
in all directions and the traffickers and numbers-game tycoons 
set up shop there, creating parallel societies that are out of 
control. In the no-mans-land of a favela, the rights 
of other citizens who pay taxes and submit to social and 
economic rules are being violated. With the dizzying growth of 
the favelas, everything escapes the control of the 
authorities--from melees in broad daylight to the nightly "funk" 
[preceding word in English] dances, interspersed with the 
bloodbaths of gang warfare. The Red Command and its explosive 
offspring, the Third Command, can exist and prosper only with 
the collusion of the police, who allow themselves to be 
corrupted and even blend in with them on their extermination 
missions. 
  The gangs live outside the law because the law exists not to 
be enforced. Day after day, the outlaws advance in a sort of 
organized looting of the wealth of the State astride the 
favelas, under the eyes of compliant policemen. A survey done by 
IPLAN [Planning Institute] in 1991 listed 545 favelas 
in Rio, but now there are many more, because IPLAN's criteria 
excluded the minifavelas (not that "mini" after all) under the 
overpasses and the illegal and clandestine housing developments. 
There are also favelas that are extensions of others 
but have grown so big that their communities have started 
organizing themselves separately. 
  Favelas have existed in Rio for 101 years, but 
this does not mean they have to be considered as inevitable and 
eternal. Now they house the underground third of the city's 
population. They began modestly when the soldiers who had fought 
at Canudos came to the capital city to ask for government help 
and camped on Providencia Hill near the military headquarters. 
As promises remained unkept, the soldiers started building 
shacks. The hill came to be called "Favela Hill" (later changed 
to Providencia) because the hills that surrounded Canudos had 
been covered with a typically northeastern plant known as 
"favela." 
  A century later, the scenario is much worse. With hegemony 
between the Red Command and the Third Command at stake, the 
radius of criminal activities has expanded in the direction of 
new paiois [strongholds]. The narcotics traffic has 
now taken over Niteroi, Sao Goncalo, and a large part of the 
Western Zone, besides the hills and smaller housing projects 
downtown, in the South and North Zones, and particularly in the 
wooded areas where the military-style camps that shocked the 
environment minister are set up. Even the smaller hillsides have 
at least 15 AR-15 rifles apiece, not to mention 12-caliber 
shotguns, automatic pistols, and grenades. Most of the weapons 
in the hands of the traffickers arrive by sea. More than 
two-thirds of the ships that bring weapons to Rio fly the 
Liberian flag. Guns manufactured in different countries arrive 
via Africa, while drugs move in the opposite direction. 
  The Red Command controls 80 percent of the narcotics traffic 
in Rio, but the Third Command, although it has only the other 20 
percent, controls strategic hillsides that are coveted by the 
Red Command. The shootouts, killings, and corruption--all this 
characterizes an intolerable situation. The violence is 
insupportable, society cannot withstand such a deterioration in 
its standards of respectability, but what is worse is the 
lenience exhibited by the authorities while traffickers based in 
the favelas continue to reap profits of $100 million 
every year with impunity--a sum they split fraternally with the 
rotten portions of the police force and the political structure.

  [Text] The Rio police, schizophrenically split in two 
halves, one civilian and the other military--but both 
incompetent--work only when pressured to do so. Major crimes 
that get a lot of attention force them to take action. But with 
the passage of time, things go back to "business as usual," as 
exemplified by the gangs of drug traffickers who wallow in 
bloodbaths in the Acari shantytown, the scene of a dispute over 
drug markets. 
  Under the eyes of police who are in league with them, the 
rival bands portray the two faces of the collusion-dependent 
personality of organized crime: Parazao, the Red 
Command's enforcer, accused on one occasion of having cut up a 
10-year-old boy with a chain saw because he had been playing on 
their turf, is the bad side, the one that encourages terrorism. 
His archenemy, Jorge Luis, is worshipped as a god by the 
community for maintaining an atmosphere of tranquility, as if he 
were the good side. The shantytown is the stage where the gang 
members cavort, always with violence. 
  These gangs prosper only because there is no police 
presence. 
Filling the vacuum, the drug traffic and the numbers game lords 
take their positions, give orders, and revoke them, counting on 
the complicity of the police. In last week's bloodbath, in which 
12 people were killed after 30 traffickers arrived by truck and 
vans, armed with machine guns and grenades--there is, as always, 
a suspicion that the police were involved. Before the violence 
broke out, three [police] vehicles had driven through the 
favela, as if casing the area. Traffickers identify 
police from the Drug Enforcement Division as being associates of 
Parazao. 
  Thus accused of corruption and complicity, the Rio de 
Janeiro 
police are once again the focus of attention, in a privileged 
position alongside the traffickers in their fury. That is where 
one finds the examples of insubordination, corruption, abuse of 
power, violence, and promiscuous collusion with organized crime. 
The police complain about low wages--a pretext for 
under-the-table actions. But money is not their only problem. 
The cancer originates in poor training, of both civil and 
military police. Society itself, at the mercy of organized crime 
and corrupt policemen, has contributed to the spread of the 
outrages. 
  When the three police forces--federal, civil, and 
military--work together under pressure from public opinion, we 
get some results. But normally they are rivals, very often 
pursuing the same booty. The drug traffic should long ago have 
been made the number one priority of the police because of its 
toxic effects, the violence, its tremendous power to fragment a 
society. What characterizes the Brazilian police is precisely 
its failure to set priorities: its activities dissolve into 
indecision, into lack of purpose. The result is a disproportion 
that is less and less perceived, between the ability of the 
police to curb delinquency and the increase in the security 
crisis. 
  The Acari favela is a typical example: the police 
know the gangs are there, know who the leaders are, know their 
hideouts, and know what territories they are fighting over. But 
the police cannot manage to get organized--or do not want to 
organize--to combat them. The dispute has become so acrimonious 
that it has been suggested that the army intervene to battle the 
traffic in the shantytowns. Political considerations have killed 
that initiative. 
  After the massacre, the police visited the favela. 
Strategically, organized crime waited for them to leave before 
going back into action. It is a vicious circle. It has come to 
the point where violence not associated with any spiritual 
principle has degenerated into a gratuitous force, into satanic 
frolic, into violence for violence's sake, and it will 
ultimately destroy everything around it. Meanwhile, the police 
are still standing by, arms folded.

  [Text] After 45 days of investigation, the Civil Police 
Drugs and Narcotics Headquarters in Rio Grande do Sul State have 
broken up a ring of cocaine traffickers from Bolivia. The 
ringleader was Odamir Davi Bertuol, 28, an engineer and owner of 
the Edifa condominium management company in Porto Alegre. His 
office was used as a narcotics contact and sales point. Two 
kilograms of cocaine were seized when the five people were 
arrested. 
  Every 15 days the group brought in 10 kilos of cocaine, 
reaping a $30,000 profit on each shipment. Chief Mauricio 
Finkelstein, of the narcotics headquarters, requested and 
obtained an order for temporary detention of those involved. 
They include Almeida Faviero dos Santos and Marcos Barcelos de 
Menezes--the latter worked three years at a secret 
cocaine-refining laboratory in the Bolivian jungle.

<F P=106> [Article by Gabriel Freire] </F>
  [Excerpts] Last Tuesday the director of the Investigations 
Police, Nelson Mery, announced the formation of the National 
Financial Crimes Office. The reasons the police chief cited are 
quite simple. During 1992 the Economic Crimes Brigade received 
3,000 investigation orders and, with great efficiency, recovered 
818 million pesos. In 1993 the number of investigation orders 
issued by the courts did not change much, reaching 3,100. But 
over 2.66 billion pesos were recovered. This means that the huge 
amounts stolen through fraud had multiplied by a factor of at 
least three. 
  Not only did the numbers grow, but so did specialization and 
the use of advanced technology to falsify public documents and 
instruments, not to mention the new and infrequently reported 
cases of computer fraud. 
  In Mery's report on Tuesday, he said that Bridec [Economic 
Crimes Brigade] "is a unit that has shown a great increase in 
efficiency during this period. Crimes like robberies with 
intimidation or crimes involving bloodshed generally have a much 
greater impact on public opinion. But white-collar criminals 
cause considerable damages to the state, to development projects 
that the state has to finance, and to workers who are victims of 
fraud and swindling." [passage omitted] 
  A few years ago, Bridec operated only in Santiago. Today it 
has units in all regional headquarters, the result, a 
high-ranking police official said, of "the difficult changes in 
the Chilean economy." 
  Money laundering is always directly related to drugs, but it 
is an eminently economic crime, for this "black" money comes not 
only from drugs, but also from tax evasion, arms trafficking, 
and hundreds of lesser crimes that produce dirty money that 
needs to be laundered. 
  To counter this new scourge while waiting for Parliament to 
enact legislation, the Investigations Police began to work on it 
a year ago. 
  Police experts from the Antidrug Brigade and from Bridec who 
will be working under the coordination of a team of attorneys 
from the State Defense Council have taken courses to upgrade 
their skills in England, the United States, Germany, and Italy. 
  Six officers, including police officers with accounting 
degrees, are also in contact with foreign police agents who are 
experts in money laundering. They will also have the direct 
support of the FBI office that is to be set up in Chile, as well 
as of the U.S. DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration]. 
  Chile's prospects for preventing economic crimes seem 
favorable. This is no place for people who want to pursue their 
base designs of swindling their fellow citizens. As Nelson Mery 
said, "No matter who they may be, they will end up in jail."

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The magazine SEMANA disclosed today that Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff, acting on his own and without 
consulting anyone, has been conducting negotiations for more 
than a month with members of the Cali Cartel. According to the 
publication, the document signed by De Greiff himself reportedly 
gave a kind of safe-conduct pass to alleged Cali and Tulua drug 
traffickers to keep them from being arrested in the future. The 
names of these drug traffickers are well-known figure Pacho 
Herrera, Jose Olmedo Campo, and a man named Renteria. According 
to the magazine, the passes would clearly show Prosecutor De 
Greiff has been in direct contact with the Cali Cartel 
chieftains for more than a month, without previously consulting 
the government or informing the security corps or the Attorney 
General's Office. SEMANA said a top government source expressed 
the government's surprise about the actions taken individually 
and privately by the prosecutor, since late last year the 
government and this office agreed to keep each other informed of 
any developments. 
  According to SEMANA, the serious thing about the case is not 
the fact that the prosecutor is acting like a loose cannon, but 
that from the moment when the drug traffickers first went to his 
office--that is on 14 January--it marked the beginning of the 
preliminary investigations. In other words, this marked the 
beginning of the search for evidence that must be provided by 
the DAS [Administrative Department of Security], the Dijin 
[Judicial Police and Investigations Directorate] in Colombia, 
and Interpol. The odd thing is that the Prosecutor General's 
Office did not officially inform any of these organizations.

<F P=106> [EL TIEMPO editorial: "Hot Money"] </F>
  [Text] There has been rather frequent mention in recent 
times of the alleged link between money of dubious origin, 
generally called "hot money," and the conduct of political 
campaigns. The issue has taken on particular relevance in view 
of the fact that there will be a series of elections this year 
and the campaigns of candidates of all persuasions are in full 
swing. 
  Naturally, to prevent the use of funds and resources of 
illicit origin, provisions have been made for campaigns to be 
financed according to very explicit standards and controls. But 
the infusion of hefty sums of money into these campaigns, money 
whose origin has not really been established, has given rise to 
complaints about its use. Two specific cases have already been 
reported in the departments of Cauca and Atlantico. 
  There is no question of accepting the accusations at face 
value without conducting the necessary investigation. But it is 
appropriate, indeed imperative, that the Office of the Treasury 
Inspector, which has such a propensity to become distracted by 
other matters that appear to be an abuse of authority, devote 
its energies to the rigorous oversight that is incumbent upon it 
in these cases, as many have urged it to do. 
  Any possibility that election campaigns, and political 
campaigns in general, may be using resources of illicit 
provenance should be confronted, investigated, and stopped at 
the earliest opportunity. Radical action must be taken; there is 
no excuse for any delay whatsoever. If there are any signs 
pointing to this possibility, the situation must be clarified 
immediately to ensure that campaigns are absolutely clean. The 
Office of the Prosecutor General, for its part, should be 
equally vigilant to make sure the appropriate legal standards 
are strictly upheld, and that penalties for violations are 
imposed without leniency. 
  We understand how difficult it is to pinpoint hot money. But 
it is easy to smell it, to feel it: an excessively lavish 
campaign carried out by someone who is not that wealthy, someone 
who just manages to live on his salary or his inheritance, 
someone who is in no position to afford to spend fabulous sums 
to get elected. When that happens, "something is rotten in the 
state of Denmark." The voters can, should, and must grasp these 
subtle nuances in politics, because if the initial election is 
corrupt, what happens afterwards will definitely be harmful. The 
watchword of democracies in the world today should be to defeat 
corrupt or hot money, whatever you want to call it. Otherwise, 
democracy will have a hard time surviving.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 13 Feb (AFP) -- Colombian and 
international cocaine cartels are now resorting to using 
minisubmarines to smuggle cocaine, the Colombian police 
disclosed today. 
  Colombian police seized seven of these minisubmarines in 
1993, according to a report released by the Administrative 
Department of Security (DAS--the secret police) and published 
today by the Santa Fe de Bogota daily EL ESPECTADOR. According 
to the report, the DAS and Interpol have determined that the 
submarines used for shipping large amounts of drugs to Europe 
and the United States are manufactured in Santa Marta and 
Barraquilla, two Colombian ports on the Caribbean coast. 
  EL ESPECTADOR disclosed that these minisubmarines are five 
meters long and equipped with electronic systems that allow them 
to navigate just a few meters deep and as shallow as one meter 
below the surface of the water. Colombian authorities first 
seized submarines that were smuggling cocaine a few months ago, 
and this allowed them to determine that the shipments were 
leaving Santa Marta and Barranquilla en route to black markets 
in the United States and Europe. 
  DAS Director Fernando Brito explained that with these 
minisubmarines, drug traffickers avoid radars and naval convoys 
patrolling international waters. He said that after the use of 
these minisubmarines was discovered in 1993, authorities 
intensified their efforts in fighting drug trafficking at sea, 
which is conducted by way of cargo ships and the minisubmarines. 
The minisubmarines are made of fiberglass, which insulates them 
from the sea's temperatures. 
  Investigations by Colombian authorities warn that the 
Italian 
and Colombian drug cartels are taking advantage of the political 
turmoil in some European countries and their lack of resources 
for fighting drug trafficking. EL ESPECTADOR emphasized that 
the capos of the Cali Cartel are closely linked to the Italian 
Mafia and some Israelis, warning that their presence was 
detected in Colombia in 1993. 
  EL ESPECTADOR also pointed out that recent investigations 
have established that the Cali Cartel is using Ecuador and 
Venezuela as transshipment points. In these two nations, the 
Cali Cartel has established front companies that it uses to ship 
containers to Europe and the United States. 
  The newspaper concluded by saying the DAS will forward a 
report to the Interpol Secretariat headquartered in France with 
a description of the labels the drug traffickers use on packages 
that contain drugs. This document will be distributed in 167 
countries affiliated with Interpol, along with a list of names 
and codes used by the drug traffickers. According to a DEA 
report, the Cali Cartel is responsible for 80 percent of the 
world's cocaine trafficking.

  [Text] Starting today, a faceless judge has 10 days to 
confirm the Office of the Prosecutor General's request to 
sentence Juan David Ochoa Vasquez to a six and a half year 
prison term. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Juan Ortiz] Today, the 
Prosecutor 
General's office sentenced Medellin Cartel drug trafficker Juan 
David Ochoa Vasquez to six and a half years in prison, within 
the anticipated sentencing framework for the crimes of illicit 
enrichment, drug trafficking, and collusion. At the hearing, 
which lasted approximately four hours, Deputy Prosecutor General 
Francisco Jose Sintura defined the terms of the negotiation, 
which includes the sentence handed down and the payment of a 
multimillion bond. [Sintura] The Prosecutor General's Office 
decided to impose a sentence, after granting the reductions 
allowed by law for confessing, voluntarily surrendering to 
justice, and reaching an agreement with us. 
  [Ortiz] With this sentence, Juan David Ochoa could request 
parole in a little more than a year since by then he will have 
served 75 percent of his sentence, started on 16 February 1991. 
Today's agreement with Juan David Ochoa Vasquez concludes the 
proceedings against the Ochoa familiy, the first one to accept 
surrendering to the law. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Carlos Fazio: "Drugs: Over Those </F>
Roads in the South"] 
  [Text] On 9 February the U.S. Government disclosed part of 
its new antidrug strategy. It stressed the importance of 
treatment and prevention of drugs at home, as well as 
alternative economic development and strengthening of the 
institutions charged with combating drug trafficking abroad. 
  In theory, and regarding the international component of the 
new strategy, there seems to be a change of course. Robert 
Gelbard, U.S. assistant secretary of state for international 
drug trafficking affairs, has said that while in the past a 
special effort was made to intercept and seize drug shipments 
destined for the United States, the current plan is aimed at 
cocaine-producing countries, combining eradication of coca 
plants with self-sustained development. 
  In principle it sounds good. The only catch is that this is 
the strategy's publicity portion. During the past few years the 
drug trafficking issue has been at the core of relations between 
Washington and Latin America. In its development this issue has 
been defined by the White House as a national security problem 
and in fact has gradually become a threat to the internal and 
external security of the rest of the area's countries. 
  During the two most recent Republican administrations 
(Reagan-Bush) the concept of "drug trafficking" occupied the 
central spot in the new sociological language on drugs. Stress 
was put on the external nature of this "malignant" problem. The 
core of the problem was thought to consist of narcotics 
trafficking and transportation. 
  In other words, the danger was thought to stem from the 
supply, which the Reagan-Bush administrations regarded as a 
threat to U.S. social and even institutional structures. 
  Since the first Reagan administration, political-strategic 
logic ruled out the drug phenomenon's economic and commercial 
rationale. In the cause-effect diagnosis, ideology replaced 
pragmatism. With the hobbyhorse of "morals," the emphasis on 
solutions was expressed in words like "combat, war, and 
crusade." The Pentagon said it was necessary to combat the 
problem "at its origin"--production and processing centers--with 
highly coercive and repressive methods. 
  This argument, which failed to underline the importance of 
demand as the cause of the supply--and which therefore concealed 
the situation's commercial and financial reality--evidently had 
a political objective, that is to say, to transfer the cost of 
the fight to the producing countries. 
  Roughly, this has been the story of the failed "war on 
drugs" 
of the past three Republican administrations with three 
additions. Drugs have also invaded a very specific 
area--counterinsurgency. 
  Pentagon and Department of State publicity fanned the notion 
of "narcoterrorism" in the framework of a counterinsurgency 
policy, which has to do with the new standard that the U.S. 
Department of State seeks to impose on the subcontinent at the 
end of the Cold War. 
  During the Reagan and Bush administrations, the most 
prominent U.S. proposal to the Latin American drug-producing 
countries was to create a coercive regional counternarcotics 
force, with extraterritorial jurisdiction which could operate 
without the limitations imposed by sovereignty at local borders. 
  In view of the "coca for development" Andean 
strategy--encouraged by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori and 
Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora--Washington implemented a 
policy stressing military aspects. 
  Bush, both president of the world's largest 
narcotics-consuming country and the epitome of contradiction, 
avoided facing the problem at home and pressed to mobilize the 
Armed Forces of the "drug countries" into carrying out 
essentially police tasks. 
  In addition, the Pentagon succeeded in establishing some 
posts in area countries, particularly Peru and Colombia. Two 
examples are Santa Lucia military base in the Upper Huallaga in 
a Peruvian coca-producing zone controlled by the Shining Path, 
and a base in Leticia, Colombia in the Amazon area of the border 
with Peru, where 500 U.S. soldiers are stationed. 
  Although Bill Clinton's speech now emphasizes the antidrug 
struggle at home and the budget allocation for the external 
front has been reduced, part of what he failed to say when he 
explained his strategy makes it possible to conjecture that the 
new president will continue to apply some of the former policy's 
central components through the militarization of producing 
countries. 
  It is no mere chance that there are U. S. military engineers 
in Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Guatemala in the framework of 
the "Caminos del Sur/94" exercise. 
  Their alleged tasks hint at the nature of their specific 
assignments, such as training in Guatemala, training and radar 
site installation in Colombia, and participation in the local 
fight against drugs in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia. These are 
functions usually assigned to the police. 
  In reality, the Pentagon has spent a great deal of time and 
money on these actions and has succeeded in involving the CIA 
and DEA. 
  For this reason, we can assume that President Clinton was 
carried away by the momentum of the circumstances. While he says 
one thing in his speeches, in practice he follows and improves 
on previous strategies in Latin American countries.

<F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez: "The Island's Long-Standing War on </F>
Drugs"] 
  [Text] Havana, 10 Feb (PL) -- The recent burning of 2.5 
tons of cocaine by authorities is the latest chapter of an 
already long history of the nation's war on drug trafficking. On 
this occasion, the drug destroyed was part of shipments lost by 
international drug traffickers in their illegal operations near 
the Cuban archipelago. This situation has, on different 
occasions, even led to arrests, trials, and sanctions by local 
courts. 
  In fact, the Cuban Government's organization of the fight 
against drugs dates back many years and is even coordinated with 
international organizations and other countries interested in 
the topic. 
  Not even U.S. administrations, which Cuba has accused of 
politicizing the issue and using it as a weapon in its 
traditional conflict with the island, have been excluded from 
the cooperation Havana has proposed and is implementing to deal 
hard blows to drug traffickers. 
  A glance at the past reveals an interesting and important 
balance regarding Cuba's war on drugs. 
  In 1992, for example, Cubans seized 1,647.91 kg of cocaine 
and 2,000 kg of marijuana, captured three boats, and held 12 
drug traffickers, who were remanded to the courts. 
  In June of that same year, a national commission to combat 
drugs was created, comprised of representatives from the 
Justice, Interior, Foreign Relations, and Public Health 
Ministries, the Attorney General's Office, and General Customs. 
An earlier UN report cited Cuba among the top 10 countries of 
the continent in seizing cocaine and marijuana. An important 
thing about Cuba is that it does not produce or consume drugs. 
  In January 1993, the courts sentenced five U.S. drug 
traffickers for possession of drugs and illegal entry in Cuba, 
following contacts with U.S. authorities and the exchange of 
information on the matter. In May of last year, Cuban ovens 
incinerated almost 200 kg of cocaine found in bags that had 
drifted onto central Camaguey Province coasts as a result of 
illegal operations conducted in nearby waters. 
  In June 1993, authorities burned another 400 kg of drugs 
that 
had also drifted here through the northern keys in Camaguey and 
Ciego de Avila Provinces. In the same month, 2.5 tons 
confiscated from different points in Cuba were incinerated. 
  Last November, 10 foreigners and Cubans were tried and 
sentenced. They had been arrested when a specialized corps 
dismantled an entire network of drug traffickers, who used the 
island as a transshipment point for drugs sent from Colombia to 
Germany. 
  In a declaration by Gerd Merrem, director of the UN program 
for international control on drugs, the United Nations 
recognized Cuba's participation in the international effort 
against the drug scourge. 
  Merren praised the efficiency of Cuban authorities in 
combating drug trafficking, and he mentioned that the developed 
long-standing cooperation has left a deep mark because of the 
sincerity and professionalism of experts devoted to this task.

  [Editorial Report] Radio Progreso at 1200 on 9 February 
reports that Cuba plays an active role in the fight against drug 
trafficking. Several foreigners have been arrested transporting 
drugs within Cuban territorial waters attempting to smuggle 
drugs into U.S. territory, which were later incinerated under 
official supervision. 
  An example of the efficiency of the National Revolutionary 
Police in its fight against drugs is the case of a man in Havana 
City who was arrested for growing marijuana in his backyard. 
According to Detective Pablo Ibarra Martinez, Alejandro Valdes 
Friel from Cerro Municipality was arrested for growing 62 
marijuana plants in his backyard and for the possession of 10 
packages of the drug in his home. After being arrested, Valdes 
confessed that he had the plants for his own consumption. 
Investigators determined that he had been carrying out this 
activity for several years and had been previously arrested for 
the same crime. The suspect is currently in jail charged with 
the possession of toxic drugs. This crime can carry a sentence 
of from three to eight years in prison.

  [Text] The seven individuals captured by Interpol in Guayas 
with a half-ton shipment of cocaine are incarcerated, and are 
being subjected to intense questioning at the offices of the 
Second Guayas Regiment. They may possibly be introduced to the 
public today. 
  This disclosure was made by Lieutenant Colonel Abraham 
Correa 
L., chief of that police office, who stated categorically that 
none of those under arrest had been tortured or mistreated, as 
persons interested in procuring the captives' release are 
apparently attempting to claim. 
<H5>  Legal Arrests </H5>
  Correa declared that "Operation Nortenito" was the result of 
many investigations conducted by agents from this office for 
nearly four months. They began bringing results last Sunday, 
when several members of this drug trafficking organization were 
caught "red-handed." They had concealed the drugs inside a truck 
parked in a garage at the La Atarazana housing complex. 
  The Interpol chief remarked: "With the police intelligence 
data, the police superintendent in charge, Manuel Velez, was 
asked to issue the pertinent search and arrest warrants for the 
suspects, to prevent their possible release later on grounds 
that the proper legal procedures were not followed." 
  Abraham Correa also confirmed the fact that those in custody 
had not been mistreated. He said that, on the contrary, they are 
being visited regularly by members of the Guayas Red Cross, who 
are responsible for examining them and determining that they are 
in good condition. 
  He added that this type of procedure had been carried out in 
previous operations, in which members of the Human Rights 
Commission also verified that torture was not used to obtain 
information from the accused. 
<H5>  Operation Continuing </H5>
  He also remarked that "Operation Nortenito" is continuing, 
noting that they are now on the trail of the Colombians, 
Alejandro Castano Garcia and Agustin Rodriguez Garcia, as well 
as other persons of different nationalities involved in the drug 
traffic and who are currently fugitives at large. 
  The seven subjects under arrest are seriously implicated in 
the possession of 540 kg of cocaine hydrochloride, the 
international market value of which exceeds $10 million. 
  According to the Interpol investigations, the drugs were to 
be shipped through this city's seaport to Miami, camouflaged 
among Colombian products such as cookies, candy, and instant 
coffee.

  [Excerpt] The number of persons captured by the National 
Police in connection with "Operation Nortenito" has risen to 10. 
This operation made it possible to discover half a ton of 
cocaine ready for shipment to the United States. 
  The last three to be arrested are Hugo Segura Hurtado and 
Oswaldo William Rivera Cabezas, both corporals in the Customs 
Military Police [PMA] on active duty, and the civilian, Jaime 
Oswaldo Suarez Valencia. 
<H5>  They Were Evading Immigration Inspection </H5>
  The Interpol chief in Guayas, Lieutenant Colonel Abraham 
Correa, claimed that both Segura Hurtado and Rivera Cabezas were 
working at the Guayaquil airport, and had connections with the 
drug trafficking ring. They were linked, in particular, with 
Kleber Delgado Delgado (also in custody), who was responsible 
for delivering the drugs to them, concealed in various export 
items. 
  According to the investigations, both members of the Customs 
Military Police were assigned to prevent drug shipments from 
getting through the immigration screening process. However, they 
had managed to put shipments aboard airplanes bound for the 
United States. 
  Interpol agents, who were pursuing the drug traffickers, 
discovered Delgado delivering several packages to the corporals. 
Consequently, Interpol coordinated its action with the 
headquarters of the Customs Military Police, an agency that 
arrested Segura and Hurtado. Both were turned over to the 
National Police last Wednesday morning. 
  The two subjects in custody were moved to the Second Guayas 
Command, where they are being held along with the Colombians, 
Alfredo Arturo Benavidez Coral, Juan Carlos Gamba Garcia, and 
Mario Fernando Jurado Portilla, as well as the Ecuadorians, 
Kleber Eudoro Delgado Delgado, Ivan Gerardo Pineda Flores, Luis 
Fernando Mejia Tarupi, and Nelson Orlando Benavidez Medina. 
<H5>  Another Arrest </H5>
  Finally, last Thursday morning, the Interpol agents captured 
Jaime Oswaldo Suarez Valencia at the Guayaquil airport. In the 
statements made by several of those implicated who were 
captured, it was claimed that Suarez played a part in the drug 
trafficking crime under investigation. 
  It was also learned that the counternarcotics agents are 
tracking at least six more persons said to be seriously 
implicated in the drug traffic. 
<H5>  Confiscated Assets Shown </H5>
  Yesterday morning, the National Police organized a tour of 
the properties confiscated from the drug traffickers captured in 
"Operation Nortenito." 
  These assets include a residence in the Los Albatros housing 
complex owned by Kleber Delgado Delgado; a warehouse located at 
Km 4 of Juan Tanca Marengo Avenue, where the drug dealers had 
been storing and packing the drugs brought from Colombia; and an 
office located on the second floor of the building at 418 
Chimborazo and Clemente Ballen Streets, where the Intersis 
office, owned by Delgado, is operated. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Report on Captures 
  The report issued by the agents who participated in the 
capture of the accused indicates that, at 1630 on Saturday, 15 
January of this year, the Ecuadoran citizens, Luis Alberto Mejia 
Tarupi and Nelson Orlando Benavides Medina, were arrested. They 
had arrived in Guayaquil on Wednesday, 11 January, driving a 
white Ford 350 truck with license plates PFS-293, on which they 
were carrying 500 packages of drugs (cocaine hydrochloride), 
with a gross weight, including their wrappers, of 541,976 grams. 
The shipment was camouflaged in boxes containing Colcafe 
[Colombian coffee], cookies, candy, lollipops, chocolates, etc. 
  The report adds that, when the aforementioned vehicle 
reached 
Guayaquil, it was kept in a garage located on Nicasio Sadafi 
Avenue, at the La Atarazana housing complex. They left the truck 
in the care of those residing there who served as guards of the 
premises, several of whom were witnesses to the seizure of the 
drugs and the arrest of Mejia Tarupi and Benavidez Medina. 
<H5>  The Interrogations </H5>
  During the preliminary interrogations conducted, Luis Mejia 
Tarupi claimed that the drugs were intended for Kleber Delgado 
Delgado, following a telephone call to be made to the Hotel 
Internacional Orquideas, No. 2, room number 205. Hence, several 
agents went to the aforementioned room with the subject in 
custody, to wait for the call, which was made. During the 
conversation, an unidentified speaker told the subject to remain 
there, so that they could call him back to give him the 
respective instructions for delivering the merchandise (drugs). 
  At 1500 on Sunday, 16 January, the Colombian citizens, Juan 
Carlos Gamba Garcia, Alberto Alfredo Benavidez Coral, and Mario 
Fernando Jurado Portilla, arrived at the hotel, located on 
Olmedo Avenue between Chile and Chimborazo. They were 
accompanied by the Ecuadoran, Kleber Delgado Delgado, riding in 
a white Chevrolet Vitara without plates. 
  The report stresses that only Alfredo Benavidez got out of 
the car, heading for the room where Mejia Tarupi was waiting. He 
made contact with the latter and was arrested. 
  The police acted immediately to capture the rest of those 
implicated who were still in the vehicle. During the search of 
those arrested, Kleber Delgado was found to have a Ruger make 
pistol with two loaders and 29 9-mm caliber shells. This 
evidence was stored at the Interpol warehouses. 
  Those arrested, except for Luis Mejia Tarupi, were taken to 
the police headquarters lockup, together with the vehicles and 
the confiscated drugs. 
  Luis Mejia was detained in the hotel room, because it was 
known that he must have had other contacts, and might possibly 
be visited by other members of the "narco"-criminal organization. 
<H5>  Customs Police Captured </H5>
  As the investigations progressed, the Interpol agents 
captured two active members of the Customs Military Police who 
were participating directly in the shipment of cocaine from 
Guayaquil to the United States, through the Challenger air 
freight company. 
  Those under arrest, Corporals William Oswaldo Rivera Cabezas 
and Hugo Segura Hurtado, admitted their association with the 
drug traffickers during the preliminary interrogations. 
  Since the two PMA members were working outside Guayaquil, 
arrangements were made with that institution's general 
headquarters to have them taken into custody and sent to the 
principal port. 
<H5>  Drugs at the Airport </H5>
  As a result of these arrests, the agents determined that the 
"narco"-criminal organization was not only using this city's 
seaport for shipping out drugs, but might also have been doing 
so from the airport, thanks to the cooperation of the customs 
policemen who were captured. 
  Both Rivera and Segura, who were working at the air 
terminal, 
maintained contact with Delgado who, after packing the drugs in 
bales of T-shirts printed with Galapagos Islands tourist 
advertisements, was storing the merchandise in the Challenger 
air freight firm's warehouses. There, the dishonest policemen 
were pretending to make a counternarcotics check of the cargo to 
be put aboard the planes. For their purposes, however, they knew 
in advance which boxes contained the drugs, because the name 
Jose Heredia was being used to identify them. This made it easy 
for them to locate the boxes that they were supposed to send 
through without the checking and inspection procedure. 
  Moreover, these individuals were objecting to the 
counternarcotics check being made by the National Police, 
through their agents.

  [Text] Quito, 16 Feb (EFE) -- Ecuadoran police have 
discovered an alleged plan of the Colombian "Medellin Cartel" to 
establish a branch in Guayaquil, Ecuador's second largest city, 
from where it was going to distribute drugs to the United States 
and Europe, local media reported today, Wednesday. 
  According to the source, the arrest of Colombian drug 
trafficker Jorge Andrade Caliz during "Operation Victory" a few 
days ago allowed Ecuadoran police to discover the plan. Andrade 
Caliz, who is linked to the "Medellin Cartel," had 372 kilos of 
cocaine when he was arrested. 
  The Ecuadoran Drug Police also arrested Colombians Morlan 
Marulanda Mejia and Victoria Eugenia Hurtado and Ecuadoreans 
Telmo Iturralde Merchan and Cecilia Navarrete Munoz.

troops in Honduras for military purposes "no longer makes any 
sense" now that the Cold War is over, says Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina Idiaquez. 
  The president said this in reference to the existence in 
Honduras of the U.S. military base at Palmerola in the central 
Department of Comayagua, approximately 80 km from Tegucigalpa. 
  The air force base was installed at the beginning of the 
eighties and was used by the United States to support the 
Nicaraguan contras who were fighting against the Sandinist 
government and the Salvadoran Government which was fighting 
against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. 
  At present the U.S. Government is still conducting 
operations 
at the base with 1,200 troops, and the base also houses the 
Honduran Military Aviation Academy. 
  Reina Idiaquez said he is examining the existence of the 
Palmerola base from "another context" and hinted that he would 
like the antinarcotics forces to be more active. 
  Honduras has proposed to Washington that it convert 
Palmerola 
into the Central American headquarters of the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA). The United States already has 
two radars with which it monitors the flights and boats of South 
American drug traffickers who take advantage of the extensive 
aerial and maritime space of the Honduran Atlantic. 
  The Honduran president made the comment after a meeting 
today 
at the Government House with activists from the ruling Liberal 
Party when one of the participants asked him why he does not 
charge for the presence of foreign troops and use the money to 
amortize Honduras' foreign debt.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Yesterday, in one of his first 
acts as attorney general of the republic, Diego Valades 
initiated the preliminary phase of the Short-Term Program for 
Antidrug Action in Central America. Plans will emerge from it 
for international cooperation in the battle against this social 
cancer, as well as for prevention and rehabilitation programs. 
The topics to be analyzed will be: each country's problems, 
structures, and programs for national agencies, regional and 
subregional cooperation to curb illicit drug trafficking, 
intelligence coordinating centers, training, organization of 
statistical systems, legislative harmonization, money 
laundering, and drug prevention and rehabilitation. After 
stating that the drug problem cannot be attacked in an isolated 
manner, the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of the Republic] 
director stressed the urgent need to reinforce plans for 
cooperation among the nations of the region. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hermosillo, Sonora, 27 January--The first district 
judge, Otoniel Gomez Ayala, reported that the confrontation 
between three DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] agents and 
the Munoz Talavera brothers, accused of drug trafficking, has 
been pending since October 1993. This evidence has not been 
presented owing to the lack of a petition that must be submitted 
to U.S. authorities by the International Legal Affairs 
Directorate of the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic (PGR). 
  As he explained, the confrontation could not be held because 
the official note requesting the U.S. Government's permission 
for the DEA members to participate in this hearing was 
mistakenly turned over to the Mexican consul in El Paso, Texas, 
so that he, in turn, could attend to it. However, the PGR is the 
agency legally responsible for carrying out such procedures. 
  For this reason, the brothers Rafael and Eduardo Munoz 
Talavera have been unable to present the expert documentary 
evidence, or to hold the confrontation. Both are necessary 
conditions for judgment to be pronounced. 
  As for the action taken by the court to hold the 
confrontation between the accused and the United States 
counternarcotics agents, Gomez Ayala revealed that a second 
official note was issued, to obtain a response from the PGR's 
director of international legal affairs. However, he has not 
responded to date. 
  The first judge specifically noted that both Rafael and 
Eduardo Munoz Talavera face charges of crimes against health and 
illegal export of cocaine. He added that another person 
implicated in this case is Carlos Enrique Tapia Anchondo, 
currently serving a sentence in the high security prison at 
Almoloya de Juarez, in Mexico State. Therefore, legal 
proceedings have been instituted against him here as well.

  [Text] Based on the National Program for Updating 
Confiscated Assets, the Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic [PGR] has determined that the following confiscations 
have been made from various drug trafficking groups to date: 621 
landed properties, including residences; over 24,000 land 
vehicles, most of which were equipped to conceal and carry 
drugs; as well as 63 boats and nearly 1,000 heavy-caliber 
firearms, consisting mainly of submachineguns and pistols. 
  The department added that slightly over 32 million new pesos 
of the money was "in cash," and that the National Banking 
Commission has been asked to impound various accounts discovered 
in the names of presumed drug dealers. The latter include front 
men and accomplices of the brothers Ramon and Benjamin Arellano 
Felix. 
  The source stressed that, owing to the aforementioned 
program, the results of which were submitted to the Finance 
Secretariat and the Secretariat of the Comptroller General of 
the Federation, it was possible to acquire an updated record of 
the assets confiscated. 
  The department noted that, last year, 22 public auctions 
were 
held to sell the public poisoners' properties and assets, and 
that over 9 million new pesos were obtained from these auctions. 
Some of the money was used to give incentives and awards to PGR 
workers who have distinguished themselves in the performance of 
their duties. 
  On the same occasion, the department emphasized that each of 
the auctions was held through public bidding, and that the 
groundwork has been established for the computerized system to 
support a constant check of the material resources confiscated 
from organized crime.

  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 22 January--Today, the 
Office of the Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] and the 
Public Security Directorate of this municipality intercepted 
drugs worth $40 million on the international narcotics market. 
They consisted of 235 kg of pure cocaine and 137 kg of 
marijuana, which were seized today in two simultaneous 
operations conducted by the aforementioned forces, according to 
the Federal Judicial Police first commander, Jose Maria Barragan 
Barajas. 
  Based on the investigative report submitted to the agency of 
the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office [MPF], the first 
confiscation was made at the international bridge crossing to 
the United States, at Juarez Avenue. It occurred after three 
persons riding in separate vehicles following one another failed 
to meet their "contact," presumed to be an official of the 
neighboring northern country's government who was involved in 
the drug traffic, and who was to help them cross over to the 
United States. They decided to return with the alkaloid instead, 
prompting a pursuit by the Mexican police, who had been notified 
by the U.S. authorities. 
  Jaime Marquez, aged 18; Luis Miguel Martinez Garcia, 18; and 
Carlos Tapia Rodriguez, 19, the latter presumably related to a 
drug trafficking family of the same surname, were intercepted 
with the 235 kg of pure cocaine. They made their statements at 
the MPF, subordinate to the PGR. 
  Meanwhile, concurrently, the authorities captured a drug 
trafficker protecting himself with a reporter's credentials, who 
had managed to evade the Federal Judicial Police mobile units 
engaged in surveillance on the state's highways. This report was 
also made by Commander Jose Maria Barragan Barajas. 
  He explained that the subject under arrest, Juan Carlos 
Serafin Olvera, had identified himself with credentials of the 
newspaper DIARIO DE LA MANANA, and with a metal press badge. He 
was driving a cream-colored Ford Marquis vehicle with license 
plates DTM-1878, in which 137 kg of marijuana were found. 
  The aforementioned morning paper, which used to circulate in 
this border area and is not being published at present, was 
advertised on various parts of the confiscated vehicle. Found in 
the same car were three press credentials in the name of 
Salvador Noel Chacon Olguin, displayed in the rearview mirror 
and on the windshield so that the vehicle would not be stopped. 
  When presented to the news media, Serafin Olvera admitted 
that, after the closing of the newspaper DIARIO DE LA MANANA, 
where he had worked seven years as a police photographer, he 
began carrying marijuana from the Chihuahua capital to this 
locality. For each trip, he was being paid the sum of $1,000: 
$500 upon receiving the shipment, and another $500 when he 
delivered it. 
  The four persons arrested in the two police operations, as 
well as the cocaine and marijuana and the four luxury vehicles, 
were placed at the disposal of the acting agent of the Federal 
Public Prosecutor's Office.

  [Text] In order to improve the results of drug seizures on 
the nation's highways, consideration is being given to the 
feasibility of using "mobile units," under the supervision of an 
agent from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office. The proposal 
was made yesterday, during the first meeting held by the PGR's 
[Office of the Attorney General of the Republic] assistant 
attorney for local offices and inspections, Alfonso Cabrera 
Morales, with Federal Judicial Police [PJF] deputy commissioners 
from all parts of the country. 
  At this meeting, the official also called upon the PJF 
personnel to redouble their efforts in the battle against those 
committing federal crimes, and stressed the courage and loyalty 
of those risking their lives in every operation. He cited the 
need for more animals in the force's canine unit, engaged in 
detecting drugs, as well as an increase in the number of federal 
forces in areas requiring greater attention. 
  In the name of the attorney general of the republic, Diego 
Valades, he confirmed that the PGR had continued confidence in 
public servants, and support for their work. At the same time, 
he reminded them of their commitment to overcome the delay in 
the implementation of court orders throughout the country, to 
pursue their investigations of the drug traffic, and to 
dismantle criminal organizations operating in various villages 
and towns of the respective federative states. 
  He noted that, starting yesterday, constant patrols were 
established by air and on land to prevent the landing of planes 
on natural runways in several of the country's states. He also 
announced a heightening of the surveillance on coasts and docks, 
and at bus, air, and railroad terminals. 
  The PJF's state deputy commissioners, as well as the force's 
operational, technical, and intelligence directors, submitted 
detailed reports of their activities throughout the Mexican 
Republic. They cited the feasibility of putting the "mobile 
units" into operation. 
  It should be mentioned that this practice was discontinued 
some time ago, owing to the excesses committed at the time by 
bad members of the Federal Judicial Police. Therefore, to 
prevent abuses now, it has been proposed that these operations 
be headed by agents from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office. 
<H5>  Preventing Drug Addiction </H5>
  At the meeting, Cabrera Morales discussed the need for 
continuing talks with local and municipal authorities to prevent 
drug addiction among youth. He claimed that, to date, this has 
brought positive results in local schools and communities, 
noting that it would be advisable to promote concurrent medical 
care and treatment for drug addicts. 
  The assistant attorney for local offices and inspections 
remarked that good results could be accrued with the same 
resources available now, and called for stringent respect for 
human rights, to the maximum extent, on the part of each Federal 
Judicial Police officer and agent.

  [Text] Campeche, Camp., 26 January--The Office of the 
Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] will reinforce its 
surveillance activity along the state's highways, in order to 
curb the drug traffic and various other federal crimes. This 
announcement was made today by the agency's representative, 
Antonio Tiro Sanchez. 
  He added that, as has been announced nationally, the PGR 
plans to intensify its operations throughout the republic, and 
on the Yucatan Peninsula in particular. Its aim is to cover 
Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo States, where major federal 
crimes have occurred during recent years: in other words, drug 
trafficking. 
  He also remarked that the agency in Campeche has explained 
its needs to the central authorities, and that a response is 
expected at any moment, with reinforced action to combat the 
drug traffic and other types of crime of concern to the Campeche 
authorities. 
  He mentioned that one of the requests is for reinforcement 
of 
the surveillance along the state's federal highways being used 
to transport alkaloids. He admitted that there is, in fact, a 
highway checkpoint in Santa Adelayda, in the municipality of 
Paliza, but claimed that it has proven insufficient. 
  He later asserted that the reinforced surveillance will be a 
reality, adding that the critical sites detected by the PGR and 
the Army would be covered, so as to arrest those committing 
federal crimes. 
  He then stressed: "The PGR is continuing its various 
activities to prevent the commission of federal crimes, and is 
offering lectures to the citizens in general, and to teachers 
and professional people, seeking their support for the action 
being taken in this respect." 
  Finally, he reported that, during 1993, 711 kg of cocaine 
had 
been seized, plus another ounce, in Ciudad del Carmen. The Army 
also succeeded in confiscating 727 kg of cocaine and destroyed 
two marijuana plantations.

  [Text] As a result of the attacks by the Federal Judicial 
Police, who have dealt the drug traffic spectacular blows during 
recent months, with large seizures of marijuana, cocaine, and 
heroin, the criminal rings have opted to market synthetic drugs, 
such as "crack," "ice," and "ecstasy," which are cheaply priced. 
  Nevertheless, the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of the 
Republic] authorities warned that these chemical substances 
accelerate considerably the irreversible damage to the human 
body among persons consuming them. They are particularly harmful 
to the brain and other vital organs. 
  The office noted that the drug dealers, faced with the large 
confiscations made and the destruction of over a million 
marijuana and poppy crops, are known to have been forced to 
curtail their activities. They must now import most of their 
narcotics, including the synthetic types processed mainly in the 
United States. 
  By way of example, it mentioned the seizure of approximately 
70 kg of Thai heroin, discovered in offices of the Mexican 
Postal Service in Tijuana and Ensenada, Baja California. 
  It also gave a reminder of the interception, in the port of 
Manzanillo, Colima, of 10 tons of Colombian marijuana discovered 
in containers of vessels named Cordoba and Chimborazo. 
Furthermore, in Mazatlan, Sinaloa, the authorities confiscated a 
shipment of South American cocaine and cannabis indica worth 
millions. 
  It stressed that, because of their strong intoxicating 
power, 
the synthetic or laboratory-produced drugs cause irreversible 
damage to the human body, and that, as a rule, those using them 
become automatically addicted.

  [Excerpts] Another spectacular blow was dealt to the drug 
traffic yesterday by the PGR [Office of the Attorney General of 
the Republic] when, in antidrug operations conducted in several 
states of the Federation, it seized 4,164 kg of dried and packed 
marijuana. A gun battle occurred in one of them, without 
casualties. During the operations, Federal Judicial Police 
agents arrested 28 presumed drug traffickers. The value of the 
confiscated drugs exceeds 40 million new pesos. 
  The federal agents, under orders from Commander Adrian 
Carrera, also destroyed 90,420 marijuana plants located on five 
plantations in Sinaloa, Veracruz, and Nayarit States. 
  According to the police reports, the most significant 
operation took place in Sonora State, where federal agents 
arrested Roberto Palomera Hernandez, driver of a tractor trailer 
truck with Federal Public Service plates. Found in the vehicle, 
which had arrived from Guamuchil, Sinaloa, were 1,000 kg of 
marijuana, bound for the town of Tijuana, Baja California. 
[passage omitted] 
  One plantation was destroyed in Sinaloa State, and another 
in 
the settlement of Cospita, in the township of Baila, Culiacan.

  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 1 February--The local 
agency of the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic 
[PGR] warned teachers and parents of the presence of stickers 
impregnated with drugs and poison being offered to students. 
This announcement was made today by the head of that office, 
Arturo Ochoa Palacios. 
  He indicated that the illustrated stickers known as "Blue 
Star," pieces of paper with a blue star, were analyzed, and 
discovered to be saturated with drugs and poison. 
  He explained that they are the size of a pencil eraser, and 
that each star is permeated with lysergic acid (LSD); although 
others contain one of the most deadly poisons, strychnine. 
  The purpose of the distribution of these items among 
secondary school students is still unknown. Nevertheless, 
according to the official, "The information being given to 
students and teachers has been intensified, and flyers are being 
disseminated as well, to warn all educational establishments." 
  He noted that some teachers have notified the PGR 
authorities 
that the stickers are also being sold as tattoos, appearing on 
brightly colored paper and resembling postage stamps, with 
sketches of cartoon characters. 
  These stickers have been distributed wrapped in a fine metal 
sheet and, he added, constitute a new method of selling drugs to 
children and adolescents. 
  He said that teachers have also reported symptoms caused by 
contact with these substances, such as hallucinations, intense 
vomiting, uncontrolled laughter, mood swings, and body 
temperature changes. 
  Admitting that the distribution center is unknown, as is the 
length of time that these stickers have been circulating in Baja 
California, he concluded by saying: "The most important thing, 
however, is to advise parents and teachers to take precautions."

<F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Panamanian Government strongly rejects 
statements made by U.S. State Department official Robert Gelbard 
on drug money laundering. 
  A Foreign Ministry communique sent to the U.S. ambassador in 
Panama states that charges by the previously mentioned official 
are false, as Panama has undertaken serious and decisive actions 
to fight drug trafficking and money laundering since 1990. 
  The document, which lists in 12 points everything Panama has 
done to stamp out these crimes, says it is unacceptable for the 
United States to express criticism which does not seriously 
reflect the real position and will of the Panamanian Government. 
  Furthermore, the communique questions the U.S. Senate's 
delay 
in ratifying the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty [MLAT] for 
criminal affairs, which has already been approved by the 
Republic of Panama. 
  The Panamanian Foreign Ministry communique responds to 
statements made by Gelbard, who harshly attacked the Panamanian 
Government for what he called a lack of effort in fighting money 
laundering. 
  The State Department official's statements could stop Panama 
from achieving MLAT certification and from obtaining loans from 
Congress for the eradication of drug trafficking.

<F P=106> [By Manuel Alvarez Cedeno and Orlando Mendieta C.] </F>
  [Text] Planning Minister Delia Cardenas has said the U.S. 
State Department official who said Panama is not making enough 
effort to fight drug trafficking and money laundering "does not 
know the Panamanian situation or what the government has done" 
to fight the scourge. 
  This week, Robert Gelbard, the State Department official in 
charge of overseeing the antidrug fight, said Panama is doing 
very little to fight money laundering. Cardenas said: "I think 
he does not know the Panamanian situation or the efforts the 
government has made to fight drug trafficking and money 
laundering throughout the country.'' 
  The U.S. official's statement was also rejected by Foreign 
Minister Jose Mulino, who described it as "unacceptable and 
irresponsible." Minister Cardenas said: "We have done our part, 
but the United States still has one importance task to perform: 
to approve the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty [MLAT]." Panama 
and the United States signed MLAT in 1991, and it has been 
ratified by the Panamanian Legislative Assembly but not by the 
U.S. Congress. Cardenas described the position of the U.S. 
official as "unfortunate." 
  Gelbard said Panama "has not taken the necessary steps to 
counteract the problem of the presence of millions of dollars 
generated by drug trafficking." In a note sent by Foreign 
Minister Mulino to U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton, the Foreign 
Ministry lists twelve steps the administration of President 
Guillermo Endara has taken to fight drug trafficking and money 
laundering. 
  Gelbard's assertion came at a time when the Bill Clinton 
administration has announced a new policy for fighting drug 
trafficking. The new policy is based on the fight against the 
consumption of drugs and foresees a drop in financial aid to 
countries that do not make real efforts to fight the production 
and trafficking of drugs. 
  Hinton, who yesterday concluded his work in Panama, 
apologized to the Endara government for Gelbard's statement. "In 
my opinion," he said, "Panama has done a lot to fight drug 
trafficking and I can point to the efforts of organizations like 
the Judicial Technical Police, the National Air Service, and the 
National Maritime Service in this endeavor." 
  Meanwhile, Supreme Court President Arturo Hoyos affirmed 
that 
Panama "works seriously" to fight drug trafficking activities. 
He described the statement by the U.S. official as "improper." 
According to Hoyos, there is a "big difference" between this 
government and the past regime in matters having to do with the 
fight against drug trafficking because, in those days, drug 
trafficking was backed by important state officials. 
  He noted that although the state has limited resources, the 
government has done a lot to confront drug traffickers 
throughout the country. The justice said: "We must remember that 
this country has just signed and delivered documents ratifying 
the Vienna Convention regarding the fight against the 
trafficking of hallucinogenic and illegal drugs." Justice Hoyos 
said Panama has signed the MLAT with the United States and 
Colombia. He explained that although Panama has already ratified 
MLAT, which was signed in the United States, the United States 
has not ratified it.

<F P=106> [Article by Carmen Elida Contreras] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul 
Mulino rejected statements made in Washington by Robert Gelbard, 
U.S. assistant deputy secretary for inter-American affairs. 
Gelbard warned the United States could reduce its aid to 
countries, like Panama, which have not curbed drug trafficking. 
  "Expressing criticism that does not seriously reflect the 
true attitude and determination of the Panamanian Government in 
its fight against this powerful and international network of 
crimes is unacceptable," Mulino warned in a note sent to Deane 
Hinton, U.S. ambassador to Panama. 
  On 10 February, Gelbard told the international press that 
the 
Clinton administration is studying the possibility of cutting 
aid to countries like Panama, Bolivia, Peru, and other 
drug-producing countries or countries where drug traffickers 
operate and where they have not been punished. 
  Mulino recalled that since 1990, the Panamanian Government 
has been taking "serious and decisive" actions to fight the 
laundering of drug money. 
  "I reiterate my concern for the inexplicable delay the U.S. 
Senate has experienced in ratifying the Mutual Legal Assistance 
Treaty on penal matters, signed by the United States and Panama 
in April 1991," and which has been approved by the Panamanian 
Legislative Assembly. 
  According to the diplomat, all these years of postponements 
with respect to this important legal instrument "undermines your 
government official's authority to criticize." 
  In his letter, the foreign minister chronologically recounts 
at least 12 measures Panama has taken against drug trafficking 
as well as the agreements and treaties signed with other 
countries. 
  Mulino adds that "not even the United States, with all its 
resources, has been able to effectively control drug 
consumption. But this real impossibility is not an excuse to 
carelessly say that this government is not working to control" 
this problem.

<F P=106> [Communique on text of Note D.M. No. 158/94 dated 11 </F>
February signed by Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino 
and addressed to U.S. Ambassador Deane R. Hinton] 
  [Text] 
  Communique [subhead] 
Regarding publications by local and international news media on 
statements issued by a State Department official pronouncing the 
national government has not made efforts to fight the laundering 
of drug-trafficking money, the Foreign Ministry would like to 
make public the note sent to the U.S. ambassador by Foreign 
Minister Jose Raul Mulino, as follows: 
  Note D.M. No. 158/94 
  11 February 1994 
  Mr. Ambassador: 
  I have the honor of addressing Your Excellency in reference 
to public statements by a State Department official named Robert 
Gelbard to the effect that our government has not made any 
efforts to fight the laundering of drug-trafficking money. Our 
government rejects strongly these statements in view that 
serious and decided actions to fight these crimes have been 
taken since 1990. 
  I list hereunder the main actions our government has taken 
regarding the fight against drug trafficking. 
  1. The executive branch on 23 September 1993 presented to 
the Republic of Panama's Legislative Assembly the draft bill to 
approve the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic 
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances adopted in Vienna on 28 
December 1988, which was approved as Law No. 20 dated 7 December 
1993 and was published in Official Publication No. 22,429, dated 
9 December 1993. 
  2. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty on Drug Trafficking 
signed between the Republic of Panama and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 1 March 1993 was discussed 
by the Legislative Assembly's Foreign Relations Commission 
during a first debate. It is pending approval in the next 
session that is due to begin on 1 March. 
  3. On the occasion of the 14th Meeting of Central American 
Presidents held in Guatemala City between 28 to 29 October 1993, 
the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty for Penal Affairs between 
Central American countries and Panama was signed. In addition, 
the Constitutive Agreement of the Permanent Central American 
Commission for the Eradication of the Production, Traffic, 
Consumption, and Illicit Use of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic 
Substances was also signed. 
  4. The Republic of Panama and the Republic of Colombia 
signed the following bilateral agreements on 19 November 1993. 
  4.1 Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance and Judicial 
Cooperation. 
  4.2 Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance With Relation to 
the Illegal Trafficking of Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances. 
  4.3 Agreement on Measures to Prevent Diversion of Chemical 
Precursors and Essential Substances. 
  5. From 31 January to 4 February, Panamanian and Canadian 
delegations held talks on the projected mutual legal assistance 
treaties on drug trafficking and related crimes, treaties that 
are to be signed between the two countries. 
  6. Now that the Governments of Panama and Mexico have 
expressed their intent to conclude a mutual legal assistance 
treaty, it remains for the two governments to set a date for 
opening negotiations leading to the signing of such a treaty. 
  7. As part of the actions and goals that the Panamanian 
Government has outlined to combat drug trafficking and related 
crimes, strategies have been devised to reduce the risk of our 
economy and banking center being used for money laundering. 
National strategies have been devised for general prevention 
policies through the community, specifically, through the mass 
training of primary, secondary, and university students. In 
addition, a National Documentation Center, attached to the 
Attorney General's Office, has been created to coordinate 
general meetings on the rate and prevention of drug use. 
Specialized training programs aimed at government employees, 
civic club members, and private enterprise personnel have also 
been developed. 
  8. More and more prevention programs have been developed 
through the National Commission for the Study and Prevention of 
Drug-Related Crimes, Conapred, an interinstitutional commission 
created by Law No. 23, dated 20 December 1986. This law, better 
known as the Drug Law, also provides the necessary juridical 
structure to punish anyone who one way or another participates 
in money laundering. 
  Of a similar nature is Decree No. 41 of 1990, which 
stipulates the banks' duty to properly identify their clients 
and require that they make any necessary statements to certify 
the origin of their deposits or the destination of cash 
withdrawals exceeding $10,000. This decree has been augmented by 
National Banking Commission rulings aimed at checking the use of 
our banking center for activities related to drug trafficking. 
Furthermore, important meetings with high-level representatives 
of your government were held in our country in 1993 to devise 
joint strategies that make it possible to expand our working 
capability in this important sphere of our economic activities. 
High-level officials of the Panamanian Government have 
participated in these meetings as evidenced by our willingness 
and interest as a government. 
  9. The Attorney General's Office, in an effort to strengthen 
actions executed by the Specialized Secretariat for Drug Related 
Crimes, investigation agencies, and the Technical Judicial 
Police (PTJ), has established an office specializing in drug 
related crimes in every district. The assistant secretariat 
offices carry out raids and other proceedings as part of 
investigating drug related crimes. Their work is evident from 
one end of the country to the other. 
  10. The Attorney General's Office has also organized an 
Information and Audiovisual Resource Center for drug related 
problems; it operates under the Attorney General's Office. The 
center has the latest information on drug addiction which 
negatively affects elementary, high school, and university 
students throughout the country. The center also offers aid and 
support, with specialized audiovisual and technical material, to 
the Catholic Church and other churches established in the 
Republic of Panama that have plans for the prevention and 
eradication of drugs in our country. 
  11. Within the policy to strengthen the fight against drugs 
and drug trafficking, the Attorney General has submitted a bill 
with reforms to current legislation on drugs to the Legislative 
Assembly. The Attorney General has said the bill reorganizes 
crimes dealing with international drug trafficking; incoporates 
aggravating circumstances concerning the purchase, sale, or 
transfer of drugs; regulates surveillance procedures during drug 
deliveries and covert operations; and creates two district 
attorney's offices specialized in drug related crimes, with 
authority and jurisdiction throughout the country. 
  12. The actions carried out by government authorities in 
charge of preventing drug related crimes have resulted in the 
seizure of many thousands of kilograms of cocaine, marijuana, 
methamphetamines, and bazuko, and over $7 million in cash, 
presumably for laundering through our banking center. As a 
result of these actions, more than 400 persons of different 
nationalities have been arrested and legal action has been taken 
against them. 
  In addition, our government has agreed to continue working 
with Your Excellency's government in everything relating to 
cooperation by U.S. Government agencies to our national 
authorities so that, based on Panamanian legal procedures, the 
latter can successfully carry out operations to confiscate drugs 
in different sectors of our country. We also hope to strengthen 
our National Air Service so it can work to destroy alleged coca 
plantations in the Darien area--a necessary effort to prevent 
cocaine production in our territory. 
  I reiterate my concern for the inexplicable delay which your 
country's Senate has suffered in ratifying the Mutual Legal 
Assistance Treaty for Criminal Affairs signed by the two 
countries in April 1991 and approved by our Legislative Assembly 
in Law 20 on 22 June 1991. All these years of delay by the U.S. 
Senate in ratifying this important legal instrument, undermines 
the authority of your government officials to criticize the 
collaboration that the Government of the Republic of Panama 
undertakes with your and other countries to fight drug 
trafficking. 
  The fact that the limitations we face in fighting this 
deadly 
scourge are real and, oftentimes, affect the results surely does 
not escape Your Excellency's enlightened criteria. It is 
unacceptable, however, for U.S. officials to express criticisms 
that do not seriously reflect the real attitude and will of the 
Panamanian Government in fighting this powerful, international 
criminal network. Not even in the United States, despite all its 
resources, has the enormous consumption of drugs been 
effectively controlled; however, this real impossibility is not 
an excuse for merrily saying that the U.S. Government is not 
tirelessly working to fight the consumption and traffic of 
narcotics. 
  I hope and trust, Mr. Ambassador, that the entire contents 
of 
this letter will be conveyed to the corresponding authorities of 
your country with the aim of clarifying our position and 
expressing our strong rejection of such irresponsible statements 
which undermine the good name of our country. 
  I take advantage of this opportunity to reiterate to Your 
Excellency my highest esteem. 
  [Signed] Jose Raul Mulino, foreign relations minister 
  To Your Excellency Deane R. Hinton, ambassador of the United 
States of America.

  [Text] The executive branch yesterday released a decree 
appointing retired Police Superintendent Publio Fretes as the 
new director of the National Narcotics Directorate (Dinar). 
Fretes was the head of the Investigative Department during the 
previous government and according to the "Terror Archive," he 
was one of Pastor Coronel's [former investigative police chief 
accused of human right violations] trusted men during [Alfredo] 
Stroessner's dictatorship. 
  Presidential Decree 2325 says that Publio Fretes replaces 
Superintendent Justino Ramon Bracho "who will receive another 
assignment." 
  Surprised Dinar officials confirmed in the afternoon that 
the 
decree was released yesterday morning without them knowing that 
their director had been changed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Juan Esteban Aguirre, Paraguayan ambassador </F>
to the United States, by reporter Andres Dario Cardozo 
Hohn--place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Cardozo] Ambassador Aguirre, 
it would seem that the United States still distrusts us as far 
as drug trafficking is concerned. 
  [Aguirre] The United States has given top priority to the 
drug problem. We need a precise diagnosis of drug trafficking 
in Paraguay. There is a problem and we need to know how bad it 
is to be able to implement the appropriate corrective measures. 
  I believe that at present we do not have the diagnosis of 
the 
situation that we need. 
  As to the request to allow U.S. troops into Paraguay, I do 
not believe it has anything to do with drug trafficking. I do 
not believe the U.S. military is coming to fight drug 
trafficking in Paraguay. As far as I am concerned, the two 
issues are not connected because we handle drug trafficking at 
another level, working with the United States through the 
National Antidrug Secretariat (Senad). 
  [Cardozo] Then what would be the point of these troops 
coming 
to Paraguay? 
  [Aguirre] I believe the United States looks for friendly, 
safe countries to train their troops. 
  If we bear in mind the role the United States plays in the 
world, where they deploy and use their Armed Forces to resolve 
problems, we will realize that there are few places in the world 
where they can send their soldiers without fear that they might 
be attacked. 
  [Cardozo] Would our country benefit from the presence of 
these soldiers? 
  [Aguirre] In addition to what they are promising to build, 
we 
also would benefit from being able to watch the deployment of 
the world's most advanced military technology.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 Feb (EFE) -- Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori said in Santa Fe de Bogota today that 
the U.S. counternarcotics struggle has proved useless although 
"billions of dollars were spent." "The change in the U.S. 
counternarcotics policy confirms that this policy did not yield 
the expected results." Although "billions of dollars were 
spent, nothing was attained," he said. 
  Fujimori made the remark in a news conference at the Narino 
Presidential Palace at the end of a two-day official visit. 
Fujimori said that, in view of the failure of the U.S. 
counternarcotics policy, the governments of the coca-producing 
countries, including Peru and Colombia, should outline joint 
strategies and insist that consumption is the reason for the 
persistence of drug trafficking. 
  According to Fujimori, "it is necessary to reassess" the 
alleged reduction in drug use, a crime "that has distorted our 
economies." He insisted that the problem "should be tackled by 
everyone involved" and that "imaginative solutions" should be 
sought. He said the war on drugs as it has been waged, "should 
not continue this way without offering alternatives to coca 
planters." He also said that his country cannot repress "200,000 
poor coca planters" without offering them other ways out. 
  He pointed out that drug trafficking must be attacked by 
"hitting the big ones, not the poor ones." He insisted that 
drug trafficking could end "when there is economic development." 
  The end of drug trafficking, without setting any deadlines, 
"does not depend on us, but on consumers," Fujimori concluded.

<F P=106> [From the "Good Morning Peru" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] President Alberto Fujimori's official visit to 
Colombia has concluded. The last day of his visit was very 
important, as the Neighbors Agreement that was signed will 
increase and strengthen Colombia-Peruvian relations. Both 
presidents spoke out in favor of the defense of participative 
democracy in the hemisphere. The presidents visited the [word 
indistinct] neighborhood, one of the most poverty stricken in 
this capital. [passage omitted] 
  Subsequently, President Alberto Fujimori visited Congress 
where he met with Senate President Jorge Ramon Elias, who 
invited him to sign the book of illustrious guests. [passage 
indistinct] 
  In the afternoon, the closing ceremony was held at the 
ministers' council room with the participation of state 
ministers, congressmen, and businessmen. On this occasion 
President Cesar Gaviria and President Alberto Fujimori signed 
the document organizing the Neighbors' Commission and 
Peruvian-Colombian integration. 
  Immediately after, the joint declaration signed by the 
presidents was read. The document contains 15 points of which 
the main ones are: Make official the conversations between the 
military commands to strengthen both nations' security; 
stimulate direct investment and the flow of capital; and step up 
agreements to wipe out drug production, trafficking, and abuse. 
  In the drug struggle, Peru and Colombia will develop 
specific 
initiatives with consumer nations. The presidents reiterated 
their rejection of terrorism and agreed on prompt implementation 
of bilateral measures to wipe out this scourge. 
  To conclude, during a news conference, President Fujimori 
added that there will be greater exchange of information with 
Colombia in the struggle against drugs, the goal of which is to 
attack top drug traffickers. With regard to trade, he noted 
there is interest on the part of Colombian businessmen to invest 
in the Peruvian fishing sector. Here is what President Fujimori 
said: 
  [Begin Fujimori recording] Obviously, in the drug 
trafficking 
activity there are relations between groups who operate in Peru 
and Colombia. The arrest of the El Vaticano [Demetrio Chavez 
Penaherrera] is the best evidence of the results of this 
cooperation. We must continue on this road. Of course, there 
must be greater exchange of information; there must be extensive 
reciprocal cooperation in the investigations, in the sharing of 
experiences in the struggle against terrorism and drug 
trafficking that each country has gained in these past years. 
In my opinion, in this manner we could speed up somewhat the 
results against these social scourges. On this matter, I 
believe there is a great deal one can learn from past 
experiences, a great deal. Peru, for example has had specific 
experiences in its struggle against terrorism; its efficiency 
has been highly considered worldwide. This is an experience that 
we will gladly exchange with Colombia's experience where other 
mechanisms have also been used. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Oscar Vargas Romero] </F>
  [Text] Demetrio Limoniel Chavez Penaherrera, alias 
Vaticano, the most powerful Peruvian international drug 
trafficking kingpin, was protected by Huallaga Front's 
top-ranking military commanders for four years. He even used 
Colombian Air Force planes for his illegal and criminal 
business. It was reported that he transported 3,000 kg of drugs 
on each flight on the Campanilla-Cali route. 
  Chavez Penaherrera became a sort of king in Upper Huallaga's 
northeast jungles. He could even afford an army of hired foreign 
gunmen to fight off an attempt by the Maoist Shining Path to 
take control--at machinegun point and with dynamite--of the 
transportation of cocaine paste to Colombia 
  But the Shining Path, when confronted with Chavez 
Penaherrera's paramilitary forces, withdrew and contented itself 
with protection quotas on drug shipments from roads in 
coca-producing areas as well as from clandestine airstrips. 
  These explosive revelations were made on 6 February by 
former 
DEA agent Augusto del Rio during an extensive interview with 
journalist Alfredo Barnechea during the Channel 9 program 
"Live." An important panel of narcoterrorism experts also 
participated in the interview. 
  The interview was recorded 24 hours earlier for security 
reasons involving the former DEA agent. The program included a 
large portion of the first testimony given by Chavez Penaherrera 
to National Anti-Narcotics Directorate (Dinandro) investigators 
at 1120 on 25 January. 
  In the most important part of his declaration, Del Rio shook 
the panel when he named Generals Alberto Arciniegas Huby and 
Eduardo Bellido Mora, former Huallaga Front commanders, as 
"Vaticano" protectors. 
  Using direct language, Del Rio said Bellido forced the 
abortion of the operation code-named "Campanazo" that was 
designed to capture Chavez Penaherrera. 
  "I participated in a 45-day intelligence project. The 
operation was conceived on 6 February 1992 but implemented on 3 
March 1993. We thought we were going to hit them hard but 
everyone in Campanilla had been alerted. We thought we would 
seize between 2,500 and 3,000 kg of drug, but we were only able 
to seize 500 kg of cocaine paste. All this indicates that 
`Vaticano' was able to manipulate and give orders, but always 
under Army protection," Del Rio said without hesitating. He also 
said "Vaticano" paid his protectors between $400,000 and 
$500,000 [numbers as published] for each flight. 
  During his testimony at Dinandro, "Vaticano" contradicted 
President Alberto Fujimori's assertions that his capture was due 
to the direct work of the National Intelligence Service, which 
carried out an operation that lasted three months and included 
following a former beauty queen (Lucila Boggiano, Mrs. World). 
  Chavez Penaherrera said: "I was visiting a friend at his 
home in Cali and I was arrested because I did not carry any 
identification with me. The operation was carried out by 
Colombian Fiscal Police. When I gave them my name, when they 
learned of my name, they checked it with a list of petitions in 
Maynas, Loreto. That is why they took me to Peru." 
  The drug trafficker said no Peruvian woman, least of all a 
beauty queen, had been involved in the operation that ended with 
his detention in Cali. 
  "Vaticano" said, however, that he met Alexis Janeth Ramirez 
Perdomo, a Colombian Intercontinental de Aviacion airline flight 
attendant, when he made a trip from Bogota to Cali. 
  When learning of this, television program reporters called 
the Colombian airline offices in Cali in order to find out the 
whereabouts of Alexis Janeth, but the answer was negative. 
  "We do not have her registered here," a voice answered at 
the 
other end of the telephone line. 
  Participating in the interview were congressman Julio Castro 
Gomez, former Dincote chief PNP [Peruvian National Police] 
General John Caro, CARETAS director Enrique Zileri, and 
political analysts Carlos Tapia and Federico Prieto Celli. 
  Julio Castro Gomez, a CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress] 
Supervision Committee member, revealed that at present there are 
350 military chiefs involved in drug trafficking violations in 
Huallaga Valley, the world's main source of raw material for the 
manufacture of cocaine. 
  The legislator said the officers are under investigation for 
alleged crimes committed since 1980. 
  Castro Gomez mentioned figures released in 1991 by a former 
Central Reserve Bank president saying that drug trafficking 
moves around $1.2 billion annually, that is, more than $3 
million per day. 
  "This means that drugs' corrupting power is very important 
and it would be naive not to accept that civilian or military 
authorities, particularly officials operating in emergency 
zones, might be involved in the dirty trade," Castro Gomez said, 
adding that the officers involved in drug trafficking must by 
tried by ordinary courts and not by military courts, where 
crimes are covered up because of a false esprit de corps. 
  Former Dincote chief John Caro paid homage to the honest 
military men who fought and continue to fight this scourge. 
  In order to stress his remarks, Caro mentioned the names of 
officers Mayatoshi and Taboada [not further identified], who, 
according to him, "are examples of personal dedication and 
defense of the institutions for which they patriotically work." 
  Nevertheless, John Caro expressed his dissatisfaction by 
stating that the good name of the Armed Forces and the police 
has been tarnished since many of them are tempted and ensnared 
by the corruptive power of drug traffickers who handle huge sums 
of money and are protected by hirelings. 
  With a characteristic Loreto accent, the former DEA agent 
openly accused with names and details the high-ranking military 
officers who protected Chavez Penaherrera, who has been 
arraigned on treason charges and today will be sentenced to life 
imprisonment by a faceless military court. 
  At the beginning of his deposition, Augusto del Rio 
acknowledged that Peruvian drug traffickers have now become 
actively involved in the industry. They not only buy coca from 
peasants and soak it but also have ventured into processing 
cocaine in keen competition with Colombian cartels. 
  He then reported that "Vaticano," whom he trailed in several 
operations to capture him, gained a foothold in the 
international drug business in 1989 when he had his own landing 
strip built in the village of Campanilla. 
  Del Rio claimed that at that time, having signed contracts 
with the other "firms" (other powerful drug traffickers), 
"Vaticano" rented that airstrip for $5,000 per flight. 
  He added that "when he arrived at Campanilla in 1989, Chavez 
Penaherrera was no longer `Loco Lemonier' but `Vaticano.' Or in 
other words, he was already a drug kingpin who rubbed shoulders 
with Colombians and he had entered the big business, in which he 
succeeded thanks to his good fortune and, consequently, he 
amassed a fortune." 
  Del Rio also pointed out that by personal endeavor, 
"Vaticano" gained a foothold in the Colombian market and 
directly contacted the mafias there. This, he assured, cost 
"Vaticano" his head, as the notorious Cali cartel had a lot to 
do with his capture. 
  He further stated: "The Colombians were jealous because he 
had reached the top. Moreover, the Cali cartel had been dealt a 
severe blow with Pablo Escobar's death." Del Rio's remarks 
caused a great impact in political circles, especially military 
ones. 
  To that effect, the most revealing reports are that three 
Army captains protected "Vaticano" in exchange for large sums of 
money and that a major called "Otorongo" came especially from 
Tarapoto to Campanilla to act as link to collect the protection 
money that finally ended up in the hands of the former Huallaga 
Counter Subversive Front commander, Gen. Eduardo Bellido Mora. 
  At this point, Bernechea asked him whether he had evidence 
to 
support his statement. 
  The former DEA agent said he had participated in several 
operations in the last few years in which a total of 3,000 kg of 
drug were seized and that "I have seen with my own eyes" how 
high-ranking military officers are implicated in the protection 
of drug traffickers, especially "Vaticano." 
  He said: "Let us start with Gen. Arciniegas and finish with 
Gen. Bellido. I need only show you a photograph in which you 
could see them there. But hirelings registered everybody who 
came to the landing strips so it was impossible to take 
photographs. Those who were found in possession of a camera 
were killed." 
  When giving details about how shipments to Colombia were 
made 
under the protection of Army soldiers and officers, del Rio 
noted that at that time, all movements were timed with a 
chronometer. 
  Light aircraft, for example, stayed between 8 and 10 minutes 
on airstrips for loading shipments, which were not registered 
since "agreements between firms are to the point and highly 
respected; therefore, there is no need to check them." 
  With regard to shipments made by "Vaticano," del Rio 
commented that his hirelings controlled landing strips when 
light airplanes landed and took off, while Army patrols were in 
charge of watching the cars that transported the shipment along 
highways and roads. 
  He explained that shipments were made Monday to Saturday in 
light aircraft, the number of which ranged between four and six 
per day, and flights were scheduled from 0900 to 1700. 
  Del Rio disclosed: "I saw--on two or three occasions--that 
Colombian Air Force planes were used. They took off 
transporting 3,000 kg of cocaine paste in each plane at around 
1700." He noted that the type of aircraft was similar to the 
one used by the DEA in its operations.

<F P=106> [Article by Fernando Rospigliosi from the "Controversies" </F>
page: "`Vaticano' and the Military"] 
  [Text] The arrest of drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez, aka 
"Vaticano", seems to confirm what some have feared: the 
involvement of the military--and not only those of lower 
ranks--with drug trafficking and the existence of corruption 
within the Armed Forces. Several factors point to this. 
  First, there is the testimony of Major Evaristo Castillo 
Aste 
that was published in CARETAS issue No. 1295 and then by other 
media. He gave a precise, detailed, and brave account of the 
military's relationship with drug trafficking. 
  The fact is that Maj. Castillo's charges not only link 
subordinate officers to drug trafficking. He mentioned the 
names of generals who, through action or omission, may be 
linked: General Eduardo Bellido, head of the Huallaga front for 
two years; Interior Minister Juan Briones; and Army Commander 
General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza. 
  There is also the version of another Army officer published 
in the same issue. This information confirms many other similar 
reports. 
  Second, "Vaticano" was labeled as a narcoterrorist and was 
placed under the military court. Why should a military court 
judge a drug trafficker? Didn't [President Alberto] Fujimori 
reorganize the judicial branch and issue all the laws he wished? 
Why can't the new judicial branch judge "Vaticano"? 
  This strange behavior leads to the belief that they do not 
want "Vaticano" to talk. If he is tried by a military court, 
the trial will be secret. Nobody will know what the drug 
trafficker said. There will be no point in him telling the 
military about his contact with other military from whom they 
receive orders. 
  Moreover, by keeping him under military control they can 
negotiate with "Vaticano", without the people knowing about it 
as they have done--and continue to do--with Abimael Guzman and 
the terrorist leadership. 
  Another query that arises immediately from labeling 
"Vaticano" as a narcoterrorist is that if he only dealt with 
other terrorists and not with the military, where is the fortune 
the terrorists amassed? This raises another theory mentioned a 
few weeks ago by this column: the money that the Shining Path 
leadership keeps abroad is probably part of the negotiation 
between Abimael Guzman, Fujimori, and Montesinos. 
  When jounalists recently ago asked Fujimori about Guzman's 
money, he replied: "I don't know." Why? Didn't he have the 
world's best intelligence service? Doesn't he control 95 percent 
of the Shining Path leaders? Have the tens of millions of 
Shining Path dollars vanished? 
  Third, Fujimori, General Hermoza, and Dinandro [the National 
Police Antidrug Directorate] have refused to admit that there is 
one single authority, either civil or military, who is involved 
with "Vaticano." 
  This refusal is totally unbelievable. If Fujimori, Hermoza, 
and Dinandro had admitted the links between "Vaticano" and some 
of the military, and if they had begun impartial investigations 
within the regular jurisdiction, they could have been given some 
credibility. 
  Fourth, the distracting maneuver with the artists, which was 
so obvious and unintelligent, makes it clear that there is an 
attempt to conceal something. Otherwise, what is the explanation 
for this plot that was personally initiated by the president and 
that has led nowhere? 
  The implications of the links between drug trafficking and 
the Armed Forces are dramatic. Corruption in other institutions 
can create many problems. If the police, customs offices, or the 
judicial branch are corroded by this disease, the problem is 
serious. But if the Armed Forces contract the disease, the 
situation is much worse, for several reasons. 
  One is that the military play a decisive role in the 
government, especially since 5 April 1992. 
  Another reason is that they enjoy a privileged status within 
society, like having their own jurisdiction for trials of 
military men, even in cases of common crimes. No institution can 
make a serious investigation into the military: neither 
congress, nor the police, nor the judicial branch. 
  Still another reason is the power of arms, which can be 
illegally used with much impunity, as was disclosed by General 
Rodolfo Robles, who referred to the "gang of henchmen" made up 
of military men. 
  If drug trafficking, or another form of corruption, reaches 
a 
deep level within the Armed Forces, affecting the command level, 
there could be political complications that could produce long 
authoritarian government terms and/or very costly damage to the 
country. This occurred in Bolivia with General Garcia Meza, in 
Paraguay with Stroessner, in Panama with Manuel Antonio Noriega, 
and it is currently happening in Haiti. 
  Yet, unlike Panama, Peru does not have a strategically 
important canal, and no one will come here to take away a 
corrupt military man. We will have to solve the problem 
ourselves. Honest Armed Forces officers have a great 
responsibility in this task.

  [Text] Lima, 9 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Peruvian Interior 
Minister Juan Briones Davila rejected alleged ties between 
high-ranking Army officers and drug traffickers as claimed by a 
former DEA agent. 
  The high-ranking military officer expressed his concern that 
some press have given credence to statements "by any person 
accusing officers of having covered up activities of powerful 
drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, also known as 
`Vaticano.'" 
  "Every report is investigated, but we must treat this 
information with great care," the minister stated. 
  Chavez Penaherrera was mentioned as the connection between 
Peruvian drug traffickers and Colombia's Cali Cartel, which 
after the death of Medellin Cartel leader Pablo Escobar controls 
90 percent of drug shipments to the United States. 
  "Vaticano" was captured on 13 January in Cali and was 
deported the next day to Peru, where he is being prosecuted for 
drug trafficking offenses and ties to subversive groups. 
  Last Sunday on a Lima Channel 9 program, former DEA agent 
Augusto del Rio said "Vaticano" had the personal protection of 
Army troops deployed in the area of Alto Huallaga. 
  More than 60 percent of coca leaf produced in the Andean 
nation is grown in the region, 700 km northeast of Lima. It is 
also considered the main storage center for international drug 
trafficking. 
  Del Rio, who has infiltrated drug trafficking organizations 
since 1988, said that between February 1992 and March 1993 he 
tried to capture Chavez Penaherrera during the "Campanazo" [Toll 
of a Bell] operation, but he failed because he was protected by 
the military in the area. 
  Del Rio accused Generals Eduardo Bellido Mora and Alberto 
Arciniega Huby, former chiefs of the Huallaga Front 
political-military command in the jungle region of San Martin, 
of protecting "Vaticano" in exchange for large sums of money. 
  He said Bellido Mora foiled the "Campanazo" operation from 
which authorities hoped to seize some 3,000 kg of drug, but only 
managed to seize some 500 kg of cocaine basic paste. 
  Interior Minister Gen. Juan Briones Davila stressed that 
Bellido Mora is an "excellent officer" and as chief of the 
Huallaga Front fought "narcoterrorism" in that part of the 
Peruvian Amazon region in an efficient manner.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Drug Enforcement and International </F>
Cooperation"] 
  [Text] An important piece of news connected with drug 
enforcement has recently been revealed by our investigative 
unit, which has patiently matched information coming from the 
Attorney General's Office and the Foreign Ministry. 
  It is about the presence in Lima last December of three 
prosecutors from Naples, who came to our country to investigate 
alleged links between Peruvian drug trafficking gangs and 
criminals belonging to the sadly renowned "Camorra" of Naples. 
  Italian prosecutors Salvatore Sbrizzi, Guglielmo Palmieri, 
and Paolo Mancuso came to Peru exclusively to carry out an 
investigation that has no relation to other events of public 
domain [alleged bribes accepted by former President Alan Garcia 
from Italian companies to build a subway line in Lima] that also 
are being investigated by Peruvian and Italian courts. 
  The Italian attorneys, who are confronting an age-old 
criminal organization, are prosecuting a hundred criminals in 
Naples for crimes like "vendettas," murders, and, of course, 
drug trafficking committed on an international scale between 
1983 and 1990. 
  According to the information obtained by our newspaper, 
these 
criminal Italian organizations have contacted their Peruvian 
counterparts, which apparently include the gang headed by drug 
trafficker Reynaldo Rodriguez Lopez, known by police as "El 
Padrino." 
  The visiting prosecutors also are interested in the 
mysterious death some years ago of some Italian citizens in 
Lima. The local investigations have not found out their identity 
yet, the reason for their presence in Peru, the reason they were 
killed, or who killed them. 
  As is known, nothing concrete was found out in the official 
investigation. However, it is a well-known rumor that the 
murders were the result of a "settling of accounts" among drug 
traffickers; a rumor that no longer seems to be groundless. 
  An important detail that cannot be left out about these 
Italian prosecutors' trip to Peru is that they are here because 
they have never received a reply to rogatory letters they sent 
at the beginning of November requesting specific information 
about the crimes they are investigating. 
  Fortunately, the Peruvian Attorney General's Office seems to 
be more willing to help in the case. The Peruvian prosecutor 
assigned to the case not only accompanied them during their 
investigation but she also has prepared a long report with all 
the information requested by the visiting prosecutors. 
  It is significant to point out this aspect because 
determined 
cooperation among the police and judicial officials of the 
several countries involved in drug trafficking is an 
indispensable condition so that the struggle against these 
powerful criminal organizations that move vast resources with a 
major power of corruption will have positive and permanent 
results. 
  Our country, which for well-known reasons is assailed by 
that 
scourge in all its aspects, must be exemplary in helping and 
using this kind of cooperation.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on drug-related crimes, investigations, trials, 
sentencings, and other activities in the PRC monitored by Hong 
Kong Bureau during the period 1-14 February 1994. The source 
and mode of processing are given in parentheses at the end of 
each entry. 
<H6>  CENTRAL </H6>
  In 1993 public security forces and border guards in Yunnan 
and Guangxi took effective actions to crack down on firearms and 
drug trafficking and smuggling. In the whole year, the public 
security organs and border guards in these two provinces cracked 
324 firearms trafficking cases, seizing 374 pieces of military 
firearms. They also cracked 961 drug trafficking cases, seizing 
812.3 kg of opium and 762.5 kg of heroin. The actions totally 
destroyed 136 criminal gangs. 
  The public security organs and border guard units in these 
two provinces transferred some 500 people from commanding organs 
to replenish the troops on active duty. The border inspection 
stations were on duty 24 hours a day, and strictly examined the 
vehicles and personnel moving to the interior mainland. 
  On the afternoon of 22 December 1993, the border security 
checkpoint in Mukang of Dehong Autonomous Prefecture discovered 
46.5 kg of heroin divided among three vehicles moving through 
the border to the interior area. 
  In order to mobilize the masses, the public security and 
border guard forces in Yunnan and Guangxi also dispatched a 
large number of police officers to border villages to publicize 
the government's policy on capturing smuggled drugs and firearms 
and to build up the police-civilian security network. According 
to Yunnan's incomplete statistics, in 1993 the masses provided 
148 pieces of information for the public security organs and 
assisted the police force in 193 actions. (Summary) (Beijing

  In 1993, Fujian's public security organs cracked a total of

seized 57.2 kg of drugs, as well as over 1.5 million yuan in 
profits from drug deals. 
  Over recent years, drug-trafficking rings and lawbreakers 
outside China have opened secret sea smuggling routes into 
Fujian. Driven by high profits, some wrongdoers inside China 
are willing to risk their lives and engage in drug trafficking. 
Since the beginning of this year public security organs of all 
prefectures, cities, and major counties have stepped up efforts 
in deploying antidrug police forces and setting up special 
investigation organs for cracking drug-related cases, while 
leaders of public security organs at all levels have attached 
great importance to such investigations. 
  From May to June 1993, public security organs across the 
province carried out a joint operation and cracked six 
"ice"-manufacturing dens set up by Taiwan drug dealers in 
Fuzhou, Putian, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou. On 8 May, the Quanzhou 
public security organs cracked a drug-trafficking ring involving 
drug dealers and lawbreakers from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the 
mainland, and seized 36 kg of drugs and heroin. Meanwhile, 
public security organs in all localities have made great efforts 
to trace drug sources of drug addicts, and successfully smashed 
a number of secret dens which "used drug trafficking to finance 
drug taking." (Summary) (Fuzhou FUJIAN RIBAO in Chinese 23 Jan 
94 p 7) 
<H5>  Guizhou </H5>
  The provincial political and legal affairs committee held a 
news briefing on 31 January at which it announced that in 
January 1994, a total of 2,020 fugitives were captured and 335 
criminal cases were cracked across the province. 
  The public security organs of Guiyang City and Liupanshui 
City smashed three drug trafficking syndicates and seized more 
than 3.9 kg of heroin. 
  The Guiyang City Railroad Public Security Department also 
captured two fugitives who escaped after murdering two 
accounting clerks in Guiyang on 8 January. (Summary) (Guiyang

  Police in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province have cracked a 
major 
drug-trafficking case, seizing 325 kg of caffeine and putting 
two drug dealers under arrest. 
  The two convicts, who disguised drugs as chicken feed, 
confessed that they had trafficked drugs five times since the 
beginning of 1993. At present, the case is under further 
investigation. (Summary) (Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in

  [Text] An international narcotics trafficker, Mr. Bue Xoua, 
30, a U.S.citizen, was arrested by Lao police in Vientiane on 13 
December. He had 1.5 kilograms of refined opium which he was 
preparing to mail through the Lao postal system. 
  Following an investigation by the counternarcotics police, 
he 
confessed to officials that he had received money to buy opium 
from Mr. (Yorker), an American citizen living in California. 
  After receiving the money, on 24 November, Bue Xoua entered 
Laos under the pretext of visiting relatives for the Hmong New 
Year. On arrival, he sought to buy opium from bad elements in 
Laos. He refined it so as to decrease the volume for 
convenience in shipment. Then he hid the opium inside stuffed 
cat dolls. He then wrapped the dolls as if they were gifts, 
sending them under the name of Mr. Thongtak in Hom District. 
(This was an alias created by Bue Xoua himself.) He sent them 
to Mrs. (Fervilameui) in California.

<F P=106> [Article by Philip Sherwell in Bangkok: "Embassy Aide May </F>
Testify in Drug Case"] 
  [Text] A Thai court is calling a key member of the 
undercover narcotics team at the British Embassy in Bangkok to 
give evidence in the trial of two Britons charged with drug 
trafficking. 
  The agent, a Thai woman named in previous evidence as 
Kanchana Yoowattana, allegedly gave customs officers the tip-of 
that led to the arrests nearly a year ago of Sandra Gregory, 28, 
and Robert Lock, 30. 
  Ms Kanchana works for British drug liaison officers who 
co-operate with Thai authorities to crack down on the region's 
roaring narcotics trade. It is unclear whether she will give 
evidence. 
  Gregory and Lock appeared in court for a three-hour hearing 
yesterday. 
  The court was previously told that the British Embassy drugs 
officers told Thai customs officials to watch out for Lock, whom 
they suspected of recruiting couriers to smuggle heroin to Japan. 
  But under cross-examination by Lock's lawyer yesterday, the 
investigating police officer, Capt Noppadol Karnchanarom, 
repeatedly said he could not remember many details of the case. 
A red-eyed Gregory, who is facing a life sentence after pleading 
guilty to possessing 87 grammes of heroin valued at 
&pound;24,000, 
was barefoot and dressed in a brown prison tunic. 
  She says she was carrying the drugs for Lock, who was 
arrested with her at Bangkok airport last February, but he 
denies this. 
  Speaking earlier from a police holding cell, Gregory, from 
Sowerby Bridge, Yorks, broke down in tears as she described her 
life in jail. 
  "They've taken away nearly all the English books from the 
library. There's just a pile of Bibles and Mills and Boon 
romances there. The good stuff like the Shaw has gone," she said. 
  "They have removed our Walkmans as well because someone 
smuggled a tape recording out of the prison. I'm going out of my 
head with boredom; and it's so tiring trying to be brave all the 
time." 
  She said she had also had trouble getting medical treatment 
recently and was locked in a cell with up to 100 women for more 
than half the day. She spent the rest of her time working in the 
prison bakery. 
  Since the royal pardon last summer of Karyn Smith and 
Patricia Cahill, Gregory is the only British woman in jail in 
Bangkok. There are about 20 American women in the same jail, but 
she said many had become hostile following plans to make a 
Hollywood film about the released Britons' experiences. 
  "They all say I'll be out of here on a pardon. But it's been 
made quite clear to me that won't happen," said Gregory. 
  Lock, from Oundle, Peterborough, has pleaded not guilty to 
conspiring to export heroin with intent to sell. 
  The case is expected to continue for several months.

  [Text] An international drug trafficking ring was 
dismantled Saturday in Maghnia by elements of the Tlemcen 
regional drug enforcement service, who succeeded in arresting 
the Moroccan supplier, one of his buyers, and the Algerian 
agent, and identifying the Moroccan border runner and the second 
Algerian buyer. They also seized 40 kg of cannabis resin or 
treated kif. Drug enforcement agents patroling between the Akid 
Lotfi border control point and the town of Maghnia apprehended a 
certain "B.B.," age 27, unemployed, as he was coming from the 
border in a Peugeot 404. In the trunk of the car they found 160 
250-gram wafers of kif divided into four parcels--a total of 40 
kg coming from Morocco. 
  The Moroccan supplier, a certain "B.M.," 24, unemployed, who 
entered Algeria the same day at the Akid Lotfi border checkpoint 
on a valid passport, was arrested by elements of the regional 
service. According to the same source, this person filled orders 
for drugs in the Moroccan town of Ketama and delivered them to 
Oujda. From there, a Moroccan border runner who lives near the 
border smuggled the kif into Algeria via a circuitous route, 
deliving it to a certain "D.A.," 47, unemployed, in the 
socialist village of Akid Lotfi. 
  Other members of the drug ring had set up a rendezvous for 
the following day at the town of Akid Lotfi to conclude their 
transaction, which according to police involved at least 20 kg 
of kif, according to officials in charge of the investigation. 
  The second Algerian buyer was identified, and police were 
checking into his background and whereabouts. 
  We would note finally that the border runner charged 1,500 
Algerian dinars per kilogram for his services. The drug itself 
cost 18,500 dinars and sells for 30,000 dinars (wholesale) in 
Algeria.

  [Text] Bombay, January 4: The Narcotics Cell of the Bombay 
police arrested nine persons and seized heroin, mandrax and 
hashish worth Rs 10.50 crores and recovered a mandrax-making 
unit. 
  A police inspector, Mr Daljeet Parmar, received information 
that Mohamad Yunus (30) was bringing drugs between 4 p.m. and 
4.30 p.m. near Ganesh Bhavan, 3rd Pasta Lane, Colaba, on New 
Year's Day. 
  He was arrested by the police with 18 kg of hashish, which 
was in the shape of balls and sticks and was of Indian origin. 
  In the second case, a total of 28 kg of mandrax tablets were 
seized by another inspector, Mr Pradeep Sharma, and his staff. 
Initially, 10 kg of mandrax tablets were seized from Shaikh 
Akhtar Shaikh (32) and Sayed Javed Abdul Aziz Sayed (28). 
  They revealed that they had made the mandrax tablets at a 
factory in Khirani Road, Saki Naka. This place was raided and 18 
kg more of mandrax tablets and 10 kg of methaqulone and a 
tabletting and drying machine were seized. 
  In the third case, three alleged women drug-traffickers, 
Phullu Farida Sayyed Ahmed, (27), Akhtari Begam Mulshidas 
Parulkar (40) and Almari Marya Kajitan Denis (35) were arrested 
with Hanif Mohamed Fakir (32), and 2 kg of heroin seized.

<F P=106> [Article: "Mandrax Seizures Likely To Go Up"] </F>
  [Text] Bombay, Jan. 6. Seizures of mandrax this year are 
likely to go up in comparison to those of heroin, say the 
police, who have noted this change on the basis of records of 
the past five years. 
  The other major change in the drug-running business appears 
to be a lack of trust among gangs who have now begun to ask for 
cash first and delivery at whatever time and place that the 
buyer wants. 
  In fact, what is alarming the police here is the fall in 
drug 
seizures last year. With seizures being the only indication of 
the degree of trafficking in any area, the police and drug 
enforcement agencies in the city do not know whether to 
congratulate themselves or watch out for gangs who may be 
outsmarting them. 
  "I have a feeling they are using more sophisticated 
packaging 
at the airport these days," says Mr Rahul Rai Sur, in-charge of 
the police anti-narcotic cell. "Recently we were told about 
seizures of methaqualone in Moscow and South Africa which 
originated from Bombay airport." 
  Drugs with Pakistani marking also have been fewer since last 
year. The last seizure, five kg of heroin, was made in September 
last year. 
  On the other hand, mandrax tablets are flowing in the city. 
From only 63 kg in 1990, seizures went up to 4,300 kg in 1992, 
along with Rs 4 lakh of equipment used to manufacture them. Last 
year 809 kg of tablets were seized by the police. 
  Not only are there large quantities of tablets but the 
police 
have also begun locating small factories in and around the city. 
With no expertise needed for working the tablet manufacturing 
units, which cost Rs 2 lakh each, traffickers are turning to 
addicts and unemployed youth to run these. 
  Shaikh Akhtar Shaikh Abdulla, the Vakola resident arrested 
by 
the police recently, had put up a machine at Sakinaka and was 
running it along with Syed Javed, an addict since the last three 
years. 
  Abdulla had been arrested in a mandrax case in 1989 and was 
being supplied the stuff by one Khalil Ahmed in connection with 
another man, Shanu, whom the police are yet to arrest. Before he 
became a part of the drug racket, he was an agent sending eager 
youth to the Gulf. 
  The addict, Javed, used to get his tablets from Masjid 
Bunder, he told the police, and used up three to four vials a 
day worth Rs 10 each, it was with the help of Abdulla's 
connections that the machine was put up. 
  A recent seizure of heroin is worrying the police over its 
low price. Hanif Mohammed, one of the men arrested in the case, 
hails from Ratlam, in Madhya Pradesh. He says he bought the 
heroin from one Ramesh at Rs 40,000 a kg which is Rs 60,000 less 
than the price in Bombay or elsewhere in the country.

<F P=106> [Interview with General 'Ali Akbar Puriani, the commander of </F>
the Kerman law enforcement zone; interviewer, date, and place 
not given] 
  [Text] Kerman. JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI. General 'Ali Akbar 
Puriani, the commander of the Kerman law enforcement zone, in an 
interview announced that last week in four phases of 
intelligence operations by the personnel of the Kerman law 
enforcement zone, two narcotics trafficking gangs were destroyed. 
  He said: After several days and nights of continuous effort 
and intelligence work, the counternarcotics management personnel 
succeeded in destroying a narcotics trafficking gang that was 
active on a large scale in the city of Kerman and arrested the 
12 members of the gang. He said: Nine weapons, Combat, Klash, 
Siminof, and Colt sidearms; a significant amount of combat 
ammunition; and five sedans, trucks, and motorcycles were seized 
from them, and the accused confessed to the trafficking of nine 
tons of narcotics. 
  Gen. Puriani, the commander of the Kerman law enforcement 
zone, added: With the efforts of the personnel of the law 
enforcement zone of Kerman Airport and their expansive 
investigation, a narcotics trafficking gang was identified and 
destroyed. This gang, in which 45 non-native persons were 
active, purchased narcotics from individuals in Kerman, prepared 
them in 50-780-g packages, hid them in their bodies, and 
traveling on airplanes to the provinces in the north, west, and 
northwest transported them for sale. All 45 persons were 
captured, and on them more than 10 kg of opium were seized. The 
sellers in Kerman were also identified and arrested. 
  The commander of Kerman law enforcement added: After four 
people from Zarand were taken hostage last month by armed 
outlaws, the personnel of the Zarand law enforcement region, 
after a long period of intelligence work and surveillance, 
succeeded in capturing five of the kidnappers and contacts of 
the outlaws. 
  In conclusion, he said: After a person was kidnapped by the 
armed outlaws, with the round-the-clock efforts of the 
self-sacrificing personnel of the Jiroft law enforcement region, 
the location of the outlaws was identified, and in an armed 
skirmish, two of the outlaws were killed and seven arrested. 
Five Klash weapons, some amounts of combat ammunition, and two 
motorcycles were also seized on them.

  [Text] Esfahan. JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI. A smuggler who 
sold grease to other smugglers in place of opium residue was 
arrested. 
  According to a report by our correspondent: Following the 
reports of the Hezbollah nation to the personnel of the 
antinarcotics office of the Khomeynishahr law enforcement region 
concerning the activities of narcotics trafficking gangs, the 
law enforcement officials began surveillance of the activities 
of the two above-mentioned gangs. In this connection, the 
selling gang had specified a delivery place for the narcotics in 
Esfahan. Since these two gangs were under surveillance by 
officials, at the precise time of the delivery of the substance, 
six professional smugglers with 40 1-kg sealed packages of opium 
residue and 9 million rials in cash as well as two vehicles were 
captured. 
  According to a report by the public relations office of the 
Esfahan law enforcement zone, after the seizure of the above 
substances, while weighing and examining them, the officials in 
the antinarcotics office realized that grease had been 
substituted for the opium residue packages. In their 
confessions, the accused say that the substance was sold to them 
recently by an experienced smuggler in the east of the country 
as opium residue, and because they had bought narcotics from him 
several times, they did not suspect it. 
  Based on this report, in the continuation of the examination 
of this case, the officials identified the cheating smuggler, 
who was active in one of the border cities in the east of the 
country. After his arrest, he told the officials that he had 
done so because he is deeply in debt. 
  It is interesting that a number of grease cans were 
discovered from the hiding place of the cheating smuggler. On 
the whole, four accused persons, considering their various past 
records in the trafficking of narcotics and explicit 
confessions, were sent to judicial authorities and condemned to 
jail.

Arabia. The customs officers at the airport discovered a 
quantity of hashish carefully wrapped in nylon bags and covered 
with linen cloth at the bottom of each of four tins of cheese. 
  Three Lebanese citizens were immediately detained for 
questioning. One of them is a customs agent, the second is the 
owner of a travel agency, and the third is an employee of the 
travel agency's office in Beirut. Investigations have begun to

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jumma Khan: "Action Taken Against Delinquents </F>
and Drug Mafia; Less Drug Smuggling Increased the Number of 
Addicts in the Country; Past Governments Were Unable To Stop 
Narcotics Production; a Hundred Factories Are Producing Heroin."] 
  [Text] The caretaker government has stopped those 
individuals from participating in the October general elections 
who have incurred debts of 1 million rupees or more and those 
who have had their loans forgiven. The government has prepared a 
detailed list of individuals delinquent in repaying loans 
showing that they owe a total of 62 billion rupees. Reportedly, 
up to now 700 million rupees have been repaid to banks and other 
financial institutions. According to press reports, the 
candidacy papers of 63 individuals who wanted to run for 
National Assembly seats from various parts of the country have 
been rejected because these individuals did not repay their 
loans and their names appeared in the list of delinquents. These 
individuals will not be able to participate in the elections. 
Twenty-six of these individuals whose candidacy papers have been 
rejected because of delinquency are residents of Punjab; 
eighteen are from Sindh; six from the Frontier Province and 
twelve belong to federally administered tribal areas or "FATA" 
[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]; the candidacy papers of 
ten individuals were accepted on the condition that the 
individuals would repay their loans to the bank or financial 
institution within the legally designated time. 
  The people in general have expressed their approval of the 
actions taken to end the curse of drug addiction. These measures 
were approved in a meeting of the federal cabinet and included 
certain legal amendments which will allow the immediate arrest 
of individuals involved in drug dealing and smuggling and the 
confiscation of tbeir goods and property. Such individuals could 
also be sentenced to death. At the same time, laws enforced in 
other parts of the country would apply to federally administered 
tribal areas as well. The jurisdiction of the special court 
which hears drug smuggling cases has been extended to the FATA 
areas. In order to end the curse of drugs, the civilian control 
of the special task force has been given to the Army thus making 
the military responsible for dealing with the drug mafia. The 
government of the Frontier Province has declared a dozen 
individuals who were suspected of connections with the drug 
mafia unqualified to participate in the elections. Three of 
these twelve individuals are former members of the national 
assembly. 
  Everyone is aware of the ignominy suffered by the nation and 
the country as a result of the black drug trade. Drug addicts in 
Pakistan are the living dead whose families face great hardship; 
these pitiful families are a common sight on every street and 
alley. The black wealth of drug dealers and smugglers has 
promoted various forms of evil in the society and overwhelmed 
the respectable members of society so that now the entire 
society is a hostage to "money". No one cares whether the money 
has been acquired by putting in jeopardy someone else's honor or 
life. The merchants of evil and death are now the nouveau riche 
who, in order to ply their illicit trade, do not hesitate to 
destroy human values and the dignity of the country and the 
nation. Some of the drug dealers have acquired greater influence 
and power by marrying into prominent families, whereas others 
have tried to gain power by winning elections as the candidates 
of political parties. This time as well, merchants of evil were 
expected to use their black wealth to run in the elections; 
however, the measures taken by the caretaker government may 
prevent them from doing so. The actions of the caretaker prime 
minister and the caretaker government deserve commendation. 
  Ten or 15 years ago, there were no drug addicts in Pakistan 
nor were there any drug producers. Today, there are 2.5 or 3 
million drug addicts in Pakistan. According to a CIA report, 
over the last 15 years, Pakistan has changed from a corridor or 
way station for the drug trade into a large scale producer of 
narcotics. Obviously, when narcotics are prepared on a large 
scale, its use will increase as well; thus, the number of drug 
addicts has increased over this period. According to the 
statistics available, illegal drug trade brings an annual profit 
of $120 billion. This huge sum has strengthened to an 
overwhelming degree the power of evil. The great wealth which 
narcotics dealers have acquired now gives them the power to 
attempt everything possible to ensure the continuation of their 
business. 
  On the face of it, the cultivation and preparation of opium 
is forbidden in Pakistan, but in reality, the opium poppy is 
planted on 8170 hectares and about 100 modern factories in 
remote tribal areas produce heroin from opium. Opium grown in 
Pakistan as well as opium from Afghanistan is brought to these 
factories and a total of 70 metric tons of pure heroin is 
produced annually. Two thirds of the total heroin produced is 
used in Pakistan so that now there are 2.5 to 3 million addicts 
in this country. 
  Opium, hashish and heroin are produced in the remote areas 
of 
the Frontier Province and distributed throughout the country. 
When the drug Mafia is unable to send a shipment of heroin to 
the Middle East, Iran, Turkey, Europe or the U.S., it sells the 
entire quantity locally in Pakistan and thus keeps the domestic 
addicts supplied with heroin. Actually, one could say that the 
heroin and narcotics prepared in Pakistan pose a greater danger 
to this country than to Europe or the U. S. 
  Up to 1979, very few people in Pakistan were aware of heroin 
addiction, but, gradually, the addiction spread. Whenever 
addicts were caught, they generally told the same story to the 
effect that an individual gave them free heroin to smoke and 
when they became addicted to the narcotic, he began to charge 
them for the heroin. Such statements and stories appeared in 
many newspapers. 
  Organizations and departments formed to control drugs have 
failed to do so generally because they have seized drugs now and 
then for the sake of appearance and in order to have the 
photographs of such seizures appear in the press. The fact is 
that to be able to control narcotics, it is necessary to stop 
the cultivation of opium and the production of heroin and to 
arrest and punish the prominent drug dealers who control the 
business but these measures have not been taken. Past 
governments acting under emotional or foreign pressure prepared 
impressive plans to end the curse of drugs and made tall claims 
but did nothing. Departments in charge of drug control do exist 
but their performance is zero and one reason is the black wealth 
of drug dealers which is spent relentlessly in order to allow 
the black drug trade to continue. Departments in charge of 
controlling drugs should be made effective and active and, at 
the same time, measures should be taken to make chemicals and 
other paraphernalia used in heroin production unavailable in 
Pakistan at any price. These chemicals are imported from 
outside. More effective measures than those taken in the past 
are required to stop the cultivation of the opium poppy in the 
Frontier Province. Cultivators should be encouraged to plant 
other crops instead of opium and the government should make up 
the resulting financial loss to the cultivators. The objective 
should be to make better use of the aid Pakistan receives from 
Europe and the U. S. in this connection and to phase out the 
cultivation of the opium poppy gradually. The hundred or more 
heroin producing factories should be destroyed otherwise it will 
not be possible to eradicate drug addiction.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Betrayal of National Dignity."] </F>
  [Text] The caretaker government's announcement that it 
would hand over narcotics smugglers to the U.S. or other 
countries and the permission given to the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration to do as it pleases in Pakistan and to take 
direct action in this country has caused the flight of major 
narcotics dealers from Pakistan. Meanwhile, drug mafia leaders 
are reportedly buying Stinger missiles from Afghan commanders. 
Alleged international drug dealer Haji Ayub Afridi who is wanted 
by the U.S. is reported to have fled to Afghanistan with the 
help of the Khyber Agency political authorities. The government 
of Pakistan had reportedly issued warrants for Afridi's arrest. 
  Ayub Afridi's flight shows clearly that the administration 
did not want to arrest him; it seems that by spreading reports 
of intentions to hand him over to the U.S. and of making [other] 
arrests, a clear signal was given to major narcotics dealers to 
make suitable arrangements for themselves. If Ayub Afridi was in 
fact helped to escape by the political authorities, then these 
authorities should be placed under arrest and punished. Why was 
he allowed to escape after the government had issued orders for 
his arrest? 
  The most objectionable part of the whole affair is the 
manner 
in which a U.S. agency has been allowed to take action within 
Pakistan as though this country was not independent but an 
American colony or a helpless country like Panama whose 
president was captured by American troops. Will similar action 
be taken in the near future in Pakistan and the U.S. will be 
allowed to arrest and take away anyone it wants within Pakistan? 
American spies are already raiding Pakistani homes. One cannot 
understand how the Government of Pakistan has allowed such 
things to happen. Would the U.S. ever allow Pakistani police to 
round up and arrest criminals it seeks in the U.S.? There is not 
an elected government at present holding office in Pakistan but 
being a caretaker government does not mean that national dignity 
and pride should be sacrificed. 
  The business of narcotics undoubtedly destroys generations 
and nations but it cannot be eradicated by the measures that 
have been taken so far. Governments have repeatedly announced 
that drug dealers would be punished severely. We have repeatedly 
asked that drug dealers be put to death. But as matters now 
stand, major drug dealers do as they please but unimportant drug 
agents and sellers get caught. Powerful individuals are engaged 
in the drug business and perhaps governments are afraid of them 
or they are the government's backers. 
  These powerful drug dealers may now be buying Stinger 
missiles and getting ready for a major show-down. If the reports 
of the sale of Stinger missiles are true, then the Government of 
Pakistan should first of all seek help from the government of 
Afghanistan and ask it to dissuade Afghan commanders from 
selling their Stinger missiles and protecting drug dealers.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Refusal To Hand Over Narcotics Smugglers to the </F>
United States."] 
  [Text] According to responsible sources, the Government of 
Pakistan has informed the United States that the alleged 16 
narcotics smugglers would not be handed over to the U.S. without 
being given the opportunity to defend themselves in a court of 
law. Nowadays, reports are being published regularly in the 
national press stating that the U.S. has asked Pakistan to hand 
over 16 narcotics smugglers who are considered by U.S. 
Government departments to be major figures in the narcotics 
smuggling business. According to reports, the Government of 
Pakistan has so far arrested 11 smugglers and has speeded up 
efforts to capture the remaining escaped smugglers. We consider 
the Government of Pakistan justified in refusing to hand over 
narcotics smugglers to the U.S. The government's action was in 
line with the national priorities of an independent country. 
Undoubtedly, narcotics smugglers do not deserve any special 
treatment; these individuals have inflicted the greatest injury 
on Pakistan where the number of addicts has now reached 2 
million. The economy of the country has been undermined by the 
black wealth of the drug dealers; hence, we have always 
advocated strong action against drug smugglers. However, the 
manner in which the U.S. press has suddenly started a propaganda 
campaign against Pakistan regarding narcotics and the U.S. has 
begun to insist that smugglers be handed over shows clearly that 
interference is taking place in the affairs of an independent 
and free country; moreover, such actions imply that our laws and 
system of justice are not dependable. No country, not even a 
world power, has the right to issue directives or orders to 
another country. In regard to the U.S. demand, one should also 
remember that under the pretext of bringing these smugglers to 
justice, the U.S. could wage a propaganda campaign against 
Pakistan on the national and international level and thus 
inflict great injury on Pakistan's reputation. At any rate, if a 
criminal is a Pakistani, then Pakistan alone should have the 
right to take action against him. It would be very dangerous to 
allow a foreign country to take action against any criminal 
within Pakistan.

  [Text] Peshawar (Court Reporter): 
Accused drug dealer on an international level, Fazlur Raziq son

recorded in court, the accused said that while he was employed 
in a tea house in Mengora, he and a companion, Aqal zada, were 
brought to Peshawar by a man named Bahadur. Negotiations were 
held in Peshawar regarding drug dealing with a group consisting 
of three men from Gandhab; at first, the negotiations were 
unsuccessful but a few days later, an agreement was reached with 
a member of the group named Amanat. The accused told the court 
that under the agreement, he and his companion went to Gandhab

he was to call himself Naushad son of Mohammad Hussain and that, 
after reaching an Arab country, he was to hand over the 
briefcase to a man who would greet him with the words (Badargah 
Walah Pakhair Raghle). However, when the accused reached the

carrying the briefcase filled with heroin. In his statement, the 
accused named the members of the group but the identities of

  [Text] The relaxation of exchange control regulations and 
the liberalised economy have turned Zambia into a "laundering" 
centre for narcotic drug money. 
  Zambia Institute of Bankers (ZIB) president Mr Bill Fearon 
said in Lusaka yesterday the apparent unlimited liberalisation 
of the economy, especially on essential goods, had made Zambia a 
stepping stone through which traffickers converted "illicit 
dirty money" into hard currency. 
  The converted currency was then ploughed back into the 
illicit business which enabled traffickers to finance further 
trade and repeat the "whole horrible exercise," Mr Fearon said. 
  He was opening a Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) workshop 
on money laundering at Barclays Bank Training Centre sponsored 
by the Bankers Association of Zambia. 
  He noted that the opening of foreign exchange bureau had 
contributed to the flourishing of money laundering because there 
was "nothing to effectively prevent unscrupulous person going 
from one bureau to another externalising and cleansing dirty 
money," he said. 
  "It is obvious the use of scarce foreign currency resources 
in this way for a poor country like Zambia can only do further 
damage to the economy and eventually the living standards," said 
Mr Fearon who is African Commercial Bank managing director. 
  Although it was widely believed that Zambia was used as a 
back-door entrance to drugs to the south, there was a "high" 
possibility there were manufacturers, suppliers and even 
couriers of drugs in Zambia. 
  Such people were getting their profits back into the country 
in form of luxury cars and non-funds or under-invoiced imports. 
  "It is frankly unlikely that we as bankers can easily 
identify such persons through a routine monitoring of their 
account activity," Mr Fearon said. 
  He appealed to Government to review the Bankers Book 
Evidence 
Act because the present one did not protect banks from suit if 
they disclosed the information about customers' account without 
a court order. 
  If drug traffickers succeeded in hiding and prospering 
behind 
the free market environment, "then we need to question whether 
we have not gone too far in the quest for liberalisation." 
  Even in developed countries, monitoring and checks on money 
movement were still in force.

  [Text] Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) officers have 
picked up a Tanzanian who had swallowed 69 pellets of heroin 
worth K24m at Lusaka International Airport. 
  Commission spokesman Mr Mukutulu Sinyani said in Lusaka 
yesterday that officers pounced on Salim Ally Bakari on his 
arrival from Bombay, India. 
  Bakari was on his way to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and was to 
board a connecting flight tomorrow. 
  Mr Sinyani said Bakari had swallowed the drugs in a bid to 
evade detection but the officers arrested him after a tip-off 
from international sources. 
  The pellets of heroin with a street value of K24m were 
released in a lavatory after Bakari swallowed medicine he was 
induced to take. 
  Mr Sinyani said among the people who had been arrested for 
trafficking by swallowing heroin, Bakari had swallowed most. 
  Bakari was a courier who had been sent by a well-known drug 
baron in Tanzania and was promised a $2,000 reward.

  [Excerpt] A South African businessman was yesterday fined 
K130,000 in a Lusaka magistrates court when he pleaded guilty to 
having Mandrax worth K304,200 and cannabis. 
  Acting principal resident magistrate Mr Philip Musonda fined 
Johannes Molife Masire, 42, because he wanted him to reform 
since he was a first offender. 
  Masire's womanfriend Esther Makawala, 32, businesswoman of 
Lilanda township was acquitted after the State withdrew the case 
against her. 
  According to facts, Drug Enforcement Commission officers 
(DEC) searched Nakawala's house where they found 76 tablets of 
Mandrax hidden under a refrigerator and another 93 tablets were 
found in his car. 
  The officers also found 5.3 grammes of cannabis worth K530. 
  In mitigation Masire's defence lawyer Mr Nigel Mofya said he 
was a first offender who required counselling on the dangers of 
drugs. 
  Mr Musonda warned Masire to refrain from dealing in drugs. 
If 
he came to court again for a similar offence he risked a 10-year 
prison sentence. 
  The vehicle and the refrigerator were forfeited to the 
State. 
  In the same court, a hearing in which Lusaka businessman 
Webster Mwenso and two traders have pleaded not guilty to having 
Mandrax was adjourned for trial to January 6 because the DEC 
prosecutor Mr Lufwendo Saboi was in Livingstone. 
  Mwenso, 53, of Roma, is charged with Andreas Paraskepolous, 
43 and Joannides Axiotis, 39, for having 1,149 grammes of 
Mandrax on April 27. 
  Paraskepolous and Axiotis' application for temporary release 
of their passports was granted but they had to pay K100,000 each 
as surety. 
  Their defence lawyer Mr Victor Kamanga said his clients 
intended to travel out of Zambia during the adjournment.

tablets with a street value of $10,660 [amount as published] 
were on Wednesday convicted after their application of change of 
plea to not guilty was thrown out by regional magistrate Mr Luke 
Malaba. 
  The six went through a trial within a trial after four of 
them had applied for change of their initial plea of guilty to 
not guilty. 
  The convicted were Shelter Rebecca Ritchie (36), Lovemore 
Ndlovu (34), Cecil Matongo (33), Harry Kaliofas (22), Joshua 
Kelemera Zidala (25) and David Muchineripi (40). 
  Mr Joseph Mate for the State told the court that on an 
unknown date but before August 23 this year, Ritchie was asked 
to sell Mandrax tablets by a friend. 
  She approached Ndlovu, who later gave a sample of the 
tablets 
to Matongo. 
  A few days later Kaliofas requested for the whole packet 
after consulting Zidala who allegedly said that the tablets were 
the correct stuff. 
  On August 23, Muchineripi took the tablets and was 
approached 
by Kaliofas to discuss the price. 
  On September 23 this year, Muchineripi was arrested at a 
local hotel. 
  They were all remanded in custody to January 19 for 
sentencing after evidence is led in mitigation.

  [Text] Sofia, February 18 (BTA) -- Last year the National 
Investigative Service specialized department carried out 
investigations in 70 cases involving the trafficking and pushing 
of about 600 kg of heroin and some 80 kg of marijuana. 
According to department head Vladimir Stoykov, drug traffickers 
and pushers can hardly be convicted because under the operating 
law the harm inflicted on society is measured by the cost of the 
narcotics sold or seized. 
  In comparison to those prevailing in Western countries, the 
price of narcotic substances in Bulgaria is low. A kilogramme 
of crack sells at 260,000 leva (about U.S.$7,000), while the 
pure narcotic cost twice as much. A shot of 0.25g is sold for 
450-500 leva in the Bulgarian black market, Mr. Stoykov said. 
Given those cheap prices, in terms of value the damages caused 
by drug trafficking and pushing fall under the title of petty 
offences, and as offenders are usually careful to keep under the 
limits set by the law, it is impossible to impose harder 
punishment on them, he went on to say. Mr. Stoychev pointed out 
that traffickers smuggling 30-40 kg of heroin had received four 
or five years in prison. Stressing that courts often release 
arrested traffickers on bail, Mr. Stoykov said that the National 
Investigative Service had no information about the number of 
convicted offenders. 
  A great number of drug pushers are amateurs who cannot 
assess 
the purity of the narcotic overdosing it sometimes. Hence the 
danger of a lethal outcome drug abusers are exposed to, 
overdosing caused the death of seven drug addicts in Sofia last 
year, Mr. Stoychev said. 
  Drug abuse became a serious problem in Bulgaria two or three 
years ago. Though the drug traffic from Asia to Western Europe 
passed through Bulgaria, the cases of pushing narcotics were few 
until then. Over the last few years drug pushing in this 
country has been on the rise. The number of drug addicts on 
record has gone up from about 3,000-4,000 to more than 20,000, 
as recent statistics show. Some 25 percent of pupils in Sofia 
have tried or are taking drugs now, Minister of the Interior 
Viktor Mikhaylov told the National Assembly some time ago. 
  Starting with glue-sniffing, 13-year-old children then take 
to heroin, Col. Slava Koeva, chief inspector at the Criminal 
Police of the Sofia Directorate of the Interior, told 
headmasters of Sofia schools yesterday. In her opinion, 
homeless and stray children are most susceptible to drug abuse. 
According to a survey conducted by the Institute of Criminology 
and Criminal Law with the Interior Ministry, 21.2 percent of 
juvenile delinquents are substance abusers and 16.5 percent are 
drug addicts, Col. Koeva said.

<F P=106> [Press release from the UK Home Office: "New Europol Drugs </F>
Unit Boosts Fight Against Drug Trafficking"] 
  [Text] European action to combat the growing menace of 
organised international crime was boosted today by the opening 
in the Hague [Netherlands] of a new European drugs intelligence 
organisation--the Europol Drugs Unit [EDU]. 
  The EDU is the first step in the creation of a European 
Police Office--Europol--which will be a central coordinating 
body for the exchange and analysis of intelligence on all forms 
of serious crime. 
  The EDU and Europol will not have any operational powers. 
Home Secretary Michael Howard hailed the move as a success for 
European police cooperation. 
  He Said: [subhead] 
  "The drugs problem is an international one, and needs to be 
tackled at an international level.'' 
  "Criminals show no respect whatever for the frontiers 
between 
countries, and our efforts must be directed to the widest 
possible fields of cooperation.'' 
  "The EDU is a sign of Member States' determination to 
cooperate closely and effectively crack down on the growing 
menace of drug trafficking and organised crime in Europe.'' 
  "I believe that Europol can play an important role in 
providing information to assist national police and customs 
services in tracking down and arresting the criminals involved 
in these activities.'' 
  "The Drugs Unit is an encouraging start. We have two liaison 
officers in post, from the police and customs services who will 
be linked into the UK via the National Criminal Intelligence 
Service." 
  The EDU Will: [subhead] 
  -- exchange and analyse intelligence on drug trafficking and 
money laundering in the European Union and the criminal 
organisations involved in these activities 
  -- give national law enforcement agencies a wider, more 
coordinated view of these activities across all Member States 
  -- help these agencies target their action more effectively 
against drug traffickers and other criminals involved in serious 
organised crime. 
  National liaison officers have been posted to The Hague from 
all Member States . 
  Each Member State must set up a unit to act as a two-way 
link 
for the exchange of information between EDU and its own police 
and customs services. In the UK this will be the National 
Criminal Intelligence Service. 
  Europol was first proposed in 1991 by Chancellor Kohl. An 
existing UK-led initiative for a European Drugs Intelligence 
Unit was absorbed into the proposal. 
  Europol will be established on the basis of a full 
Convention 
signed and ratified by all Member states. The draft Convention 
is currently under negotiation, and a deadline for completion 
has been set for October 1994 by the European Council. 
  Notes To Editors [subhead] 
  1. The EDU was formally opened in the Hague by Dutch Justice 
Minister Mr Hirsch Ballin and Interior Minister Mr van Thijn. 
  2. The EDU will operate under the terms of a Ministerial 
Agreement signed by EU Interior and Justice Minsters in 
Copenhagen on 2 June 1993. Within the EDU the treatment of 
information will be governed by Member States' own national data 
protection legislation. 
  3. Europol will be an intergovernmental organisation within 
the framework of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union. Work 
towards its establishment is the responsibility of an 
intergovernmental working group under Title VI, which reports to 
the Council of Interior and Justice Ministers. The European 
Council has set a deadline of October 1994 for completion of the 
Europol Convention. 4. Formal interviews for the senior 
management of EDU will take place in Brussels on 22 February. 
Ministers of the Interior and Justice will consider 
recommendations on 23 March. The UK will be bidding for one of 
the three posts. 5. The national liaison officers will work 
under the interim management of Mr Storbeck of Germany, and 
Colonel Bruggeman of Belgium.

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Smit: "Europol To Stretch Arm of the Law </F>
Over Borders"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam -- A prototype European Community police 
force was launched yesterday, with officers from the 12 member 
states making no secret of their ambition eventually to enforce 
the law across the EC, ignoring borders. 
  In a sleek building formerly occupied by the Dutch secret 
service in The Hague, the first chief of Europol, Herr Jurgen 
Storbeck, said he hoped to move rapidly beyond mere surveillance 
of drug traffickers. 
  Task forces or even multinational police squads should be 
set 
up, he said--a scheme long demanded by Chancellor Kohl of 
Germany, but which causes shudders in London and some other 
European capitals. 
  "I think governments will agree to this federal ideal. What 
was unthinkable 10 years ago has now become thinkable," said 
Herr Storbeck, former German head of Interpol in Wiesbaden. 
  For now, British Tory nightmares of multilingual officers 
roaming the continent are some way from reality. 
  Yesterday, as a launch ceremony was held, intelligence 
officers sat at computer monitors, checking the cross-border 
activities of drugs smugglers. More direct action against crime 
will have to wait until October, while EC countries wrangle over 
the legal convention establishing the force under the Maastricht 
Treaty. 
  Herr Storbeck said the agency could gather detailed 
information on the movements and criminal records of citizens 
around Europe in less than three hours. 
  Since mid-January, 19 "liaison officers" representing the 12 
EC member states, including two Britons, have handled about 20 
cases, supplying relevant data gathered from their national 
police services. 
  This is only the first step towards the planned creation of 
Europe-wide databanks on crime and terrorism. 
  However, there could be stumbling blocks ahead over privacy 
rules and a lack of trust between national intelligence services. 
  "The national services have an obligation to provide us with 
information, but we don't have any powers to force them if they 
are reluctant," said Herr Storbeck.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interpol Director General Raymond Kendall by </F>
Vladimir Sevela in Strasbourg; date not given: "According To 
the Interpol Chief, the Drugs Mafia in Europe Is Winning"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg -- Interpol Director General Raymond 
Kendall declared in the Council of Europe last week that the 
methods employed so far to combat the organized drugs trade have 
failed. He said that, despite the efforts by police forces 
throughout the continent, the drugs mafias have become 
consolidated during the past three years and the aggression 
shown by their organizations has also increased. 
  The Interpol chief appealed to European countries to 
incorporate their security and information services into the 
struggle against international drug mafias and to utilize all 
the potential left behind in this sphere following the collapse 
of the Iron Curtain. "Let us proceed from the fact that the 
organized drugs mafia is a foreign power set against the state. 
The current deployment of forces and resources between them and 
the police is uneven; therefore, it is necessary to apply other 
courses of action," he said. 
  Kendall also said that drugs-related crime is now spreading 
dramatically throughout Eastern Europe. Russia, Poland, and the 
Baltic states have become the main European producers of 
psychotropic substances, which are beginning to be the most 
sought-after drugs. According to Interpol's figures, several 
times more heroin was seized in Bulgaria and Hungary last year 
than in the countries with a long "tradition" of using 
it--France and Belgium. 
  Because the drugs problem is affecting the Czech Republic 
increasingly, MLADA FRONTA DNES asked Raymond Kendall for an 
interview. 
  [Sevela] How are politicians responding to your appeal to 
use the intelligence services in the struggle against the drugs 
trade? 
  [Kendall] At the moment, it is too early for me to outline 
any specific reactions, because this entire idea is--in 
essence--new. First of all, it is necessary for government and 
political officials to understand the seriousness of the threat 
represented by organized crime in the drugs trade and to be 
aware of the kind of resources that it is necessary to use. I 
think, however, that they are aware of the benefit that will 
arise from combining efforts in an assault on these criminal 
organizations. Then, it is necessary to put the security 
services--this massive apparatus for acquiring and analyzing 
information--at the immediate disposal of the authorities 
involved in the struggle against drugs. 
  [Sevela] Some politicians maintain, however, that the 
security and information services are already being used for 
this purpose.... 
  [Kendall] Yes, but intelligence centers always have a 
tendency to act independently. According to my proposal, they 
should not operate separately and in isolation. They should be 
subordinate to the people supervising the struggle against 
drugs-related crime. 
  [Sevela] Is it possible somehow to prevent corruption in the 
offices intended to combat the drugs trade? 
  [Kendall] Your question touches upon one of the biggest 
problems. Organized crime is a source of huge profit and brings 
with it the possibility of corruption among officials in all 
posts, including the most senior ones. Therefore, it is 
important for all countries--but mainly those whom corruption 
most concerns--to introduce specific measures. 
  [Sevela] You yourself are an advocate of balance between 
repression and prevention in the drugs sphere. You have 
proposed orienting efforts toward restricting the demand for 
narcotics. Should Eastern Europe proceed differently from 
Western Europe? 
  [Kendall] No, this problem is the same everywhere. Despite 
this, the countries of the former Eastern bloc are--to a certain 
extent--lucky, because the majority of people there cannot 
afford the prices that the traffickers demand for drugs. 
Another aspect is that many things from Western 
Europe--including drugs--are attractive, especially to young 
people. Of course, it is possible to avoid the problems that 
afflict us by means of prevention. It is enough to learn from 
our experience, first and foremost, in restricting the demand 
for drugs and to try to stop them infiltrating into the 
country--something that is on the increase--until your economy 
improves. 
  [Sevela] In what direction should prevention be oriented? 
  [Kendall] It is simply necessary to explain to people that 
drugs are bad. It is necessary to explain the health risks from 
these dangerous toxic substances as is being done for tobacco 
and alcohol.

<F P=106> [APA Report: "Heroin Ring Smashed, Three Nigerians </F>
Arrested"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- An American drug courier was arrested 
when he entered Austria, and 4 kg of heroin was seized. 
Officials of the Schwechat drug police thought the route of the 
24-year-old U.S. citizen James R. highly unusual. The man 
arrived on Aeroflot flight SU 261 from Brazil via Moscow at 
Vienna's Schwechat Airport at noon on Wednesday [16 February]. 
During a careful check, 4 kg of heroin was discovered in the 
false bottom of his bag. 
  When he was interrogated, James R. claimed that he was only 
the courier, and that he had received the drugs in Brazil. His 
statements led to the arrest of three Nigerians in Vienna on the 
same day. For technical reasons, the police declined on 
Thursday [17 February] to disclose their names and the functions 
within the drug ring. 
  Yesterday the fingerprints of the arrested drug dealers were 
checked. Results are expected today, Friday. Moreover, an 
exact analysis of the impounded drugs is not yet available.

<F P=106> [Article by Timo Rautava: "Europe Has To Suffer More Damage </F>
From Drugs"] 
  [Excerpts] The problems are so deep-seated that a more 
permissive approach for drug-control policies is not 
anticipated. [passage omitted] 
  "Antidrug goals are so profoundly a part of UN principles 
that we will have to work at it for many years before the 
present drug control structures can be substantially changed," 
said Chief Inspector Tapani Sarvanti of the Ministry of Social 
Affairs and Health, the head of the drug policy team. He has 
participated in the planning of drug control as Finland's 
representative on the Council of Europe, in the United Nations, 
and on the Nordic Council of Ministers. 
  They began to control drugs manufactured in the developing 
countries at the start of this century, and the general 
international agreement on them goes back to 1961. In 1971 
control was extended to drugs manufactured in the industrial 
countries and in 1988 to the international trade in drugs and 
money laundering. 
  A debate on their legalization is currently in progress in 
the area covered by the former Soviet Union and the East 
European countries, Estonia and Hungary, for example. 
  "Once a debate is engaged in, control settles on some point 
or other. Under the Soviet system, the whole issue was banned. 
The socialist countries' drug problems could not be publicly 
discussed since drugs went hand in hand with capitalism and a 
bygone age. Drugs were combated with official actions kept 
concealed from the public. Nevertheless, they got better results 
with this dishonest strategy than we in the Western countries 
did. Now that capitalism is being introduced into the former 
socialist countries, drug use in them is clearly on the 
increase," Sarvanti said. 
  In Sarvanti's opinion, many symbolic values are associated 
with drugs in the Western countries. "And the more we make a 
mystique of drugs, the more they are also used as a channel for 
rebellion. The drug problem in the slums of the United States 
has gotten out of hand. There are many subcultures there that 
have gotten involved in crime." 
  "They have gotten so deeply entangled in drugs that they can 
no longer legalize them. They don't dare do anything radical 
about them since they cannot predict what that would result in," 
he said. 
<H5>  Absolute Ban or Unrestricted Use? </H5>
  In Western Europe legalization has been discussed rather 
extensively, in addition to Spain, in Switzerland, Great 
Britain, and Germany, among other countries. The problem in 
these countries is a serious one. An absolute ban and stiff 
sentences or complete permissiveness are the extreme 
alternatives. 
  In many countries the attitude toward the problem is in 
practice somewhere between these two extremes: They try to 
minimize the damage. 
  "Every country has to take this path of minimizing the 
damage. They have to turn a blind eye to minor violations for 
practical reasons. They are forced to accept the fact that 
mainliners have to be given needles and drugs. It doesn't make 
any sense to force these people to take to the streets and 
commit property crimes to get junk," Sarvanti said. 
  "Probably one of the most radical experiments is being 
conducted in Zurich. Hard drugs may be used in a certain part of 
the city under the supervision of officials. However, the area 
in which the experiment is being conducted is an intolerable 
place for ordinary people since such a filthy business goes on 
in it. The most miserable bunch of riffraff who have abandoned 
all of the society's values gathers there in the restricted 
area." 
  In the Netherlands they make a distinction between soft and 
hard drugs. In Amsterdam the use of soft drugs is permitted in 
supervised cafes. 
  "The Dutch themselves claim that in this way they have 
reduced the number of HIV cases and drug use in general. They 
emphasize that problems are created for them by those countries 
with strict drug policies. They offer proof of their claims with 
studies they have made and officials and researchers are of the 
same opinion. 
  ``The Dutch also vigorously attack hard drugs,'' Sarvanti 
noted. However, factors other than control policy guide drug 
use. In Germany, for example, according to Sarvanti, they are 
worse off in proportion to the population than in, for example, 
the Netherlands. In many German cities they have in practice had 
to adopt minimization of the damage. 
<H5>  Nordic Countries Support Tight Control </H5>
  Right after the war, the drug problem was worse in Finland 
than it is now. At that time there were many people in this 
country who had become dependent on painkillers. Drugs emerged 
again as a problem through the hippie movement in the 1960's. 
Finland did not awaken to the fact until drugs became a youth 
problem. 
  "Now the problem is very well under control," Sarvanti said. 
In Finland private use is interfered with and the European 
practice seems to be negligent as seen from here. 
  Finland recently opposed legalization of drugs in the United 
Nations and at the same time indirectly took a stand against the 
Netherlands. "The Nordic countries are drug policy hawks; they 
support tight control but, on the other hand, follow-up 
treatment as well." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, Feb 14 (AFP) -- French drug seizures rose 
sharply in 1993 over the previous year with a 50 percent 
increase in the heroin haul, government spokesman Nicolas 
Sarkozy said on Monday. 
  Sarkozy, who is also budget minister, said a total of 40 
tonnes of drugs were seized in 1993, including 38 tonnes of 
cannabis resin, 1.28 tonnes of cocaine and more than 230 
kilograms (464.6 lbs) of heroin. 
  He added that the French customs had helped the customs 
services of several foreign countries to seize more than 33 
tonnes of drugs "through intensive exchange of information and 
coordinated operations." 
  The minister said it was difficult to tell if the customs 
service was working more efficiently or whether there had been a 
rise in drug smuggling. "In any case, this demonstrates an 
extremely preoccupying situation," Sarkozy said.

<F P=106> [Article signed V.V: "Drugs and Illegal Immigration--Highly </F>
Successful Year for French Customs"] 
  [Text] Budget Minister and Government Spokesman Nicolas 
Sarkozy performed yesterday what amounted to an evaluation of 
the single market in its first year when he unveiled the amounts 
of drugs seized by French Customs in 1993. With some 38 tonnes 
of cannabis--or twice as much as was seized in the previous 
year--last year's seizures "reached an unprecedented level." 
Concurrently, 233 kilograms of heroin were seized--a 48-percent 
increase with respect to the previous year. As for cocaine, the 
increase is minimal, even though the absolute number is high: 
1,284 kilograms (1,278 in 1992). Last, in the mercifully small 
LSD market, 23 grams of lysergid were seized in a single 
operation in 1993--enough to produce 400,000 doses for the 
underground British market. Here too, these are unprecedented 
amounts. 
<H5>  New Tools [subhead] </H5>
  While record amounts of cocaine (1,400 kilograms) and heroin 
(400 kilograms) had been seized in 1990 and 1991, respectively, 
1993 saw a steady average progression. That is, "a 50-percent 
increase as compared with 1992," the minister explained, adding 
that it was difficult to determine the relative impact of better 
operation on the part of customs, and increased amounts of drugs 
smuggled into the national territory. "In any case, this 
indicates a highly alarming reality," Nicolas Sarkozy concluded, 
with new General Customs Director Jean-Luc Vialla looking on. 
  Mr. Vialla's services describe an "unprecedented level" of 
seizures for all types of drugs except opium and hemp plant and 
hemp oil. 
  Active international cooperation, selective road checks, air 
and marine monitoring are all part of the array of weapons used 
by customs, which intend to "use new tools"--that is, fighting 
smugglers of chemical products used as precursors for the 
production of drugs, promoting cooperation in the international 
trade sector to identify illegal shipments, in addition to open 
sea interceptions and increased cooperation--including with 
Eastern European countries. Since 1 January 1993, customs have 
also been very active against illegal immigration, in 
cooperation with border police. The array of possibilities and 
prerogatives of customs has been extended in view of the 
implementation of the Schengen Convention, although the latter 
remains to come into effect. Last year's results--8,729 persons 
held for questioning as compared with 5,177 in 1992 and 5,246 in 
1991--are indicative of the scope of the new measures. However, 
one must differentiate between foreign nationals in an irregular 
situation (2,907, a figure marginally higher than in previous 
years) and those turned away (5,822, or over twice as much as 
the 1991 and 1992 figures). 
  Last, Jean-Luc Vialla indicated that the Tracfin action 
group, which specializes in intelligence and operations against 
underground financial channels--used, among other things, for 
the laundering of "dirty" money--receives "50 to 60 statements 
of suspicion" a month from banks. Although none of the 40 cases 
currently processed by the courts has been judged yet due to 
their complexity, there is "no question of terminating Tracfin," 
Nicolas Sarkozy indicated.

  [Excerpts] Stuttgart -- For the first time since 1986, the 
number of drug-related deaths last year declined in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg. According to the statistics presented by 
Interior Minister Frieder Birzele (Social Democratic Party of 
Germany), 244 people died of drug consumption--35 fewer than in 
1992. Birzele cited the declining purity of heroin as the 
possible reason because it may have prevented overdosage. 
[passage omitted] 
  However, the number of registered drug-related crimes rose 
by 
over 20 percent to 20,000 offenses. The main reason is more 
intensive police investigations, Birzele pointed out. [passage

heroin and over 30,000 German marks [DM] in drug money in a 
Stuttgart apartment. An arrest warrant has been issued against 
three Turkish citizens, whom the land criminal investigation 
department considers to be "members of a Kurdish group." The 
men, who are between 19 and 30 years old, were already arrested 
in the last week of January. The heroin, packaged ready for 
sale, is estimated to be worth some DM500,000.

  [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- Two gangs of drug smugglers have 
been busted in Baden-Wuerttemberg. According to information 
released by the police on Friday, two groups with four suspects 
each were discovered in Stuttgart and Upper Swabia. All of them 
have meanwhile been arrested. 
  One gang was busted at the end of January in the 
Baden-Wuerttemberg capital. Four Turks, aged between 27 and 51, 
were arrested. They are suspected of having smuggled heroin 
from Turkey to the Netherlands and Germany for years. A mobile 
task force cracked down on them when three of the men wanted to 
sell about 12.5 of kg heroin for several 100,000 German marks 
[DM]. 
  The other group of four dealers was busted in Ravensburg 
district. According to police information, the gang consisted 
of three Turks and a German, aged between 22 and 48. They were 
considered to be the drug suppliers for all of Upper Swabia. An 
Austrian arrest warrant had been sent out for one of the 
suspects. Reportedly, he smuggled 4 kg heroin, with a 
black-market value of DM200,000 into the country at the 
beginning of 1993. Two couriers were arrested at the border 
when they wanted to bring 2.5 kg of heroin into Germany.

  [Text] A man who had &pound;50,000 worth of cocaine strapped 
to his back and two packets of 600 ecstasy tablets tied to his 
groin when he was stopped at Dublin Airport has been remanded in 
custody to February 3 next for sentence. 
  Det Sgt Tom Madden said he arrested Andrew Carass (26), 
married and an unemployed barman, of Buckingham Village, 
Summerhill, Dublin 1 on October 30, 1992. 
  Carass told gardai he was to get &pound;1,000 which he 
wanted as 
a house deposit. "I don't use drugs. It's only for fools. Jesus, 
I'm sorry for getting into this," he told gardai. 
  Det Sgt Madden told Dublin Circuit Criminal Court that the 
defendant had 98.9g of cocaine strapped to his back and 692 
ecstasy and other tablets in two packages down the front of his 
trousers. 
  Carass pleaded guilty to importing the drugs from Amsterdam. 
  Det Sgt Madden told Tom O'Connell BL, prosecuting, that the 
cocaine was 80pc pure and could have been cut two or three times 
before sale. Cocaine sold on the streets is usually 30pc pure 
and this amount would have been worth &pound;50,000. The ecstasy 
tablets had a wholesale value of &pound;4,500. 
  Carass told gardai he also owed gambling debts to drug 
dealers. He flew to Brussels and took the train to Amsterdam 
where he booked into a hotel. After receiving an early morning 
phone call he collected the drugs at a bus shelter. 
  He had no money for the return flight to Dublin and had to 
ring another man to pay for it. He didn't wish to name this man. 
  Det Gda Madden agreed with Patrick Marrinan BL, defending, 
that Carass was easily led and had been used by other 
experienced drug-dealers as a courier. 
  Father Dermot Peakin said he had known the Carass family for 
30 years. They were very respectable and hardworking. The family 
had gone through hell since the arrest.

Drugs"] 
  [Text] Some 5,000 people in the Dublin area are now 
addicted to hard drugs such as heroin, Health Minister Brendan 
Howlin disclosed in the Dail yesterday. 
  And he admitted in reply to questions from Independent TD 
Tony Gregory that the figure could be as high as 7,000. 
  "However, it's estimated that--excluding persons attending 
the community services established by the Eastern Health 
Board--approximately 1,850 persons are receiving treatment for 
drug abuse in various treatment centres." 
  A total 352 people are on the methadone and maintenance 
programmes in the satellite clinics and a number of others are 
receiving treatment from general practitioners. 
  The services now in place and those being developed have 
been 
introduced as a result of the strategies prepared by the 
National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse and the National 
AIDS Strategy Committee, explained the Minister. 
  And he told the TD: "The deputy can be assured I regard this 
area as a priority and have made provision in the 1994 estimates 
to develop these services further." 
  Mr Gregory said that in spite of very dedicated staff the 
satellite clinics provided "little more than a Band Aid service." 
  In some instances two counsellors were looking after in 
excess of 100 addicts, and a waiting list of nearly 200 others.

  [Text] Gardai believe that they are closing in a Cork drugs 
ring which uses couriers to import LSD and ecstasy tablets into 
this country. 
  Their latest success was a few days ago, when a Cork man in 
his mid-30s was arrested at Paris Airport with almost 2,000 LSD 
tablets hidden on his person. He had picked up the drugs in 
Amsterdam, a popular location for such purchases, and was en 
route to Cork when arrested by French police. 
  This is the second such courier arrested within months 
following tip-offs from customs official on the Continent. 
Another Cork man was taken into custody at Cork Airport with 350 
LSD tablets when he arrived there from Amsterdam last August. 
  The same Cork drugs ring is responsible for most of the 
imports of such hallucinogenic drugs and regularly use 
people--often young and in debt--to bring them into this country. 
  Last March another Cork man died when condoms which held 
about 300 ecstasy tablets burst inside his body. He was on a 
Ryanair flight from Stansted to London at the time. Gardai 
believe they were also bound for the Cork market. 
  Gardai said there is considerable co-operation between 
Interpol and international customs in helping to track the 
couriers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Mafia Drug Roundup in Milan and </F>
Palermo"] 
  [Text] Milan, 16 Feb (ANSA) -- Fifty people were in jail 
this afternoon after a police launched a major roundup in Milan 
and Palermo of Sicilian and Calabrian crime figures in the 
international drug trade early this morning. 
  Milan Chief Prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borrelli and Milan 
police chief Achille Serra said the operation, which they were 
calling Costanza, had identified the key underworld figures 
responsible for several hundred kilos worth of cocaine traffic 
last year. 
  Milanese investigators were able to trace the ties between 
the Palermo Mafia and Calabrian 'Ndrangheta and their Colombian 
partners in Medellin, arresting nine persons in Palermo and 41 
around Milan. Twenty-nine persons already in jail on other 
charges were served further warrants while about 30 persons 
under indictment escaped capture this morning. 
  Among those arrested in Milan, Serra said, were members of 
some of Italy's top crime clans, including Salvatore Enea, 
Guglielmo and Stefano Fidanzati and Rocco and Antonio Papalia. 
He said they shipped cocaine from Colombia to Spain, then 
brought the drug into Italy by automobile. 
  The group also imported cocaine via Amsterdam, using 
couriers 
who carried the drug in plastic capsules they swallowed, as well 
as heroin from Turkey. 
  "Clean Hands is not the only investigation underway in 
Milan," said prosecutor Borrelli, adding that his office was 
strongly committed to battling organized crime. The office of 
the district anti-Mafia prosecutor was recently strengthened for 
just that reason, he said. 
  Police in Milan discovered the cocaine ring in 1992, after 
they searched a neo-Nazi headquarters in the Lombard capital and 
discovered that the brother of one of the members of that far 
right group was working as a drug courier from Amsterdam. The 
investigation, headed by Milan assistant prosecutor Armando 
Spataro, relied on the cooperation of several veteran Mafia 
informers, along with an "independent" drug trader who supplied 
information while maintaining contacts with the Mafia.

<F P=106> [Article signed BF/SN/UC: "Drug Enforcement. Zurich Police </F>
Are Helpless"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Zurich, 15 Feb (ATS) -- According to Arthur Grob, 
head of Zurich's municipal police drug-team, increased 
repression of drug-related crime in 1993 was ineffective. On 
Tuesday at the press conference on crime statistics, he stated 
that the police are helpless, and do not know how to curb the 
overt drug scene. 
  Zurich's municipal police arrested more drug addicts and 
dealers last year than ever before--a 51 percent increase as 
compared with 1992. The police seized 30 kilograms of heroin, 
eleven kilograms of cocaine, and 1.72 million Swiss francs [SFr] 
in cash. None of this did improve the situation, Mr. Grob said. 
  He believes that repression must be supported by the 
establishment of anti-drug "closed clinics." Out of the 1,657 
persons held for questioning last year in the Letten, some 20 
percent came from Zurich. Foreigners made up 8.4 percent of the 
total figure. 
  Drug traffickers gather in one of Zurich's red-light 
districts. Out of the 1,368 persons held for questioning, 593 
were Swiss citizens. The rest were nationals from Albania, 
former Yugoslavia, Lebanon, Turkey, and North Africa. Most were 
in Switzerland illegally--a trend already noted in 1992 
according to Mr. Grob--whereas in previous years they tended to 
be registered as asylum seekers.

<F P=106> [Article by Stewart Tendler and Ronald Faux: "Operation </F>
Begonia Nets Record Haul: Customs Team Seizes &pound;50 Million 
Cocaine Cargo"] 
  [Text] Customs and police investigators yesterday seized 
250kg of cocaine worth &pound;50 million which was hidden in a 
consignment of fresh flowers. 
  In a classic "sting" operation, undercover officers are 
understood to have posed as British buyers for the drug and 
travelled to Colombia. The Colombians also sent negotiators to 
meet them in Britain. According to one report, Greater 
Manchester police borrowed &pound;2 million to show the 
Colombians 
that the undercover men were acting in good faith. 
  The cocaine arrived from Amsterdam last week and is the 
largest single importation of the drug by air. Its seizure at 
Manchester airport marked the end of a four-month customs 
operation codenamed Begonia. 
  The haul was found in six boxes among a cargo of flowers. 
Neither the exporter nor the importer of the flowers knew what 
they concealed. Once the consignment landed, armed police and 
customs officers moved in to a warehouse and arrested two 
Colombians. 
  A national intelligence drive is currently monitoring 
possible Colombian drug infiltration. The national criminal 
intelligence service in London has established a database of 
suspicious sightings in Britain with the help of local police 
forces, immigration officials and customs officials. 
  Pat Cadogan, an assistant chief investigator, said 
yesterday: 
"We have broken an attempt by a major cocaine importer to set up 
a distribution network in the North West of England. We must 
have destroyed their credibility in the UK and a seizure of this 
kind must be a major setback for them." 
  The drugs came originally from traffickers based in Cali, 
which has replaced Medellin as the powerbase of the Colombian 
cartels. Customs investigators say the consignment was intended 
to be the first shipment on a regular new route. 
  Manchester is a key market for illegal drugs in Britain. 
Police and customs officers have been warning for some time that 
the Colombian gangs are testing western Europe in search of new 
markets because the United States has become saturated with 
cheap cocaine. 
  Last night, the two arrested men were being questioned by 
police and customs officers. 
  --West Country police are hunting for the source of a batch 
of tainted heroin sold on the streets of Bristol which killed 
two men and injured another four. 
  Paul Hicks, 30, died on 27 December and Reginald Phillips, 
40, collapsed last Thursday. Both suffered agonising convulsions 
and died within minutes of injecting the drug. Last weekend, 
four more drug users were rushed to hospital.

<F P=106> [Article: "&pound;70 Million Cocaine Haul `Marks End of </F>
Territorial Policing': Ed Vulliamy on the three-nation effort 
behind a record drugs seizure"] 
  [Text] The leaders of an international operation which led 
to the seizure of a record 263 kilos of cocaine at Felixstowe on 
Christmas Eve said yesterday that it was "only the end of the 
first phase" in breaking a drugs ring tied to the highest levels 
of the mafia. 
  They said in Rome that the ring was part of a push into the 
British drugs market, where street prices are high. 
  An Italian and a British citizen have been charged in 
London, 
and another two people have been bailed. Seven men were arrested 
in Colombia and another three in Sicily, where three more men 
are being sought by police. For the first time in the campaign 
against drugs, the arrests were simultaneous. 
  Douglas Tweedle, Customs and Excise's chief investigations 
officer and leader of the British end of Operation Angel 2, said 
British street prices for hard drugs were the highest in Europe, 
making the country a prime target. 
  The Christmas Eve shipment--organised in Sicily and sent 
from 
Colombia--was worth &pound;70 million. The authorities said that 
most was for distribution in Britain, although 108 kilos was 
destined for Sicily. 
  Mr Tweedle--accompanied by senior Italian anti-mafia figures 
and the head of the Colombian anti-drugs unit, General Campo 
Gomez--said the operation set a new benchmark in co-operation 
and intelligence-sharing between countries. The agencies were 
now investigating other important international traffickers in 
the same ring and their financial havens. 
  Mr Tweedle said: "What made this special was the scale--the 
way the law enforcement agencies have come together to do 
maximum damage to these criminal organisations--and the decision 
to look at the problem with a broad view.'' 
  "There was unprecedented confidence, with the sharing of 
sensitive intelligence between Great Britain, Colombia and Italy 
which has never happened before." 
  The Palermo public prosecutor, Giancarlo Caselli, said: "For 
us in Palermo, the containment of these attacks on society is a 
matter of our survival. Any country polluted by mafia money 
which tries to go it alone from now on is committing a fatal 
error." 
  The chief of Italy's anti-drug unit, Pietro Soggiu, said the 
era of "jealously and territorial policing has ended." 
  The operation illustrates the roles of the Sicilian command, 
the South American export barons and the alleged cells of mafia 
operatives and their contacts on the ground. 
  The trail began with documents found at the Palermo home of 
an infamous and then fugitive mafia boss, Salvatore Gallina, in 
September last year. 
  Mr Gallina was arrested a month later in Venezuela, by which 
time the use of a police informer and a series of telephone taps 
had been allowing the three agencies to follow the consignment 
"every inch of the way," Mr Soggiu said. 
  If the authorities' allegations are correct, the operation 
would be the first proof of a three-cornered cartel covering 
Sicily, the Colombian barons and Britain. 
  Mr Tweedle said the cocaine had been concealed in the false 
bases of two containers full of coffee, with a layer of lead to 
prevent X-ray detection. "Without the Colombian intelligence 
work, we would not have detected the consignment." 
  In Colombia, the alleged leader of the ring is a Sicilian, 
Giuseppe "Old Man" Triolo, said to have been sent by the Cosa 
Nostra to oversee its Latin American interests after the arrest 
of the Venezuelan-based Cuntrera brothers in 1992. He was 
arrested together with a big Colombian landowner, Edgar Troquez, 
and five others. 
  Those arrested in Sicily include Francesco Maniscalo, son of 
the head of the Corso delle Mille clan in Palermo.

<F P=106> [Article by Howard Foster and Richard Palmer: "Bungled </F>
United Kingdom Trap Lets in &pound;1 Billion of Cocaine"] 
  [Text] British and American drug enforcement officers have 
allowed up to &pound;1 billion-worth of cocaine into the United 
Kingdom in a bungled operation to trap a Colombian drugs cartel. 
  The drugs, hidden in lead ingots, were brought into Britain 
in cargo ships from Venezuela by a front company, which, 
according to lawyers and customs officers, was financed by the 
CIA, the American intelligence service. 
  CIA and British police officers who monitored the shipments 
allowed the drugs in because they hoped to gain valuable 
intelligence on senior figures in the Colombian cartel. However, 
they failed to tell British Customs and the undercover operation 
was ruined when their key informant was arrested by customs 
investigators, who seized 900 kilograms of cocaine with a street 
value of &pound;200m. 
  The case raises serious doubts about a policy that appeared 
to allow criminals to profit from drug smuggling in pursuit of 
more important targets. It has since emerged that at the same 
time, the CIA in Caracas, Venezuela's capital, allowed more than 
900 kilograms of cocaine into the United States in a similar 
operation, now the subject of a US Justice Department inquiry. 
  Details of the role of the drugs enforcement agencies in the 
cocaine shipments emerged during a &pound;40m trial at Newcastle 
crown court, which ended last Thursday when Joseph Kassar, a 
Manchester businessman, was jailed for 24 years for trafficking. 
  Kassar was the only one of nine original defendants to be 
convicted for importing cocaine from Venezuela via Felixstowe 
docks in January 1992. One died in prison, four were acquitted, 
two face a retrial and another, Brian Charrington, had no 
evidence brought against him. 
  Much of the trial collapsed after it emerged that 
Charrington, a Middlesbrough garage owner, was an informant for 
the police number two regional crime squad based in Cleveland. 
Lawyers for the other defendants want an inquiry into the case. 
Kassar's solicitor, Keith Dyson, said: "The involvement of the 
number two regional crime squad and its relationship with Brian 
Charrington and his role as an informant who was allowed to 
profit from the crime must be the subject of a major 
investigation." 
  Customs investigators had decided in 1989 to target 
Charrington, 37, who was already suspected of importing large 
quantities of cannabis into Britain from Amsterdam and Morocco. 
He had become increasingly wealthy, running a Bentley, a 
Rolls-Royce, two private jets and a deep-sea diving boat while 
selling second-hand cars from a forecourt in Middlesbrough. 
  Undercover customs officers involved in Operation Fullbloom 
followed Charrington and his associates around Europe and to 
Caracas, where he was watched entering the offices of Conar 
Corporation, a small shipping agency. 
  The company sent several shipments of cocaine to Britain and 
other parts of Europe which Customs failed to find. In January 
1992, a 900-kilogram consignment of cocaine was found hidden in 
lead aboard a ship, the MV Adviser, which had sailed from 
Caracas to Felixstowe. 
  The drugs were removed and the lead allowed to travel into 
Britain to lure out the British gang members. In March 1992, 11 
men were arrested. Charrington was taken into custody in June 
when he returned in his private jet to Teesside airport from a 
trip to France. 
  During seven months in jail before his trial, Charrington 
refused to talk to investigators about his role in the cocaine 
smuggling. He also declined to comment on almost &pound;2.5m in 
banknotes discovered in the loft of his Teesside home. These had 
traces of cocaine, cannabis and heroin on them. 
  According to senior customs investigators, there was no 
evidence of police involvement on computer records held, by the 
National Drugs Information Unit. 
  But in November 1992 investigators realised their hopes of 
nailing the man known as Target One were about to sink. Two 
officers of the number two regional crime squad drugs 
wing--Detective Inspector Harry Knaggs, now retired, and 
Detective Sgt Ian Weedon--said they would give evidence that 
Charrington was a long-term informant. 
  In January 1993, the Crown Prosecution Service said it was 
offering no evidence against Charrington and he was freed. After 
celebrating his release, he disappeared. He is believed to be in 
the Far East. 
  Police and Customs blamed each other for the debacle, but 
there were further damaging disclosures about the extent of 
trafficking taking place with full police knowledge. Tim Devlin, 
Conservative MP for Stockton South and parliamentary private 
secretary to Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, revealed 
details of six other consignments of cocaine due into Britain, 
taking the street value up to &pound;1 billion. 
  Devlin said Charrington had been one of Britain's best drugs 
informants and could have closed down half the Colombian 
cartels. He said the authorities had intended to collapse the 
case against Charrington to provide him with further cover. 
  "The whole thing is a monumental cock-up," Devlin said. "It 
has all been screwed up because the jolly old Customs think they 
are cleverer than anyone else."

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Porter, chief reporter: "Drug Link as </F>
Thieves Go Overboard for Boats"] 
  [Excerpt] Behind the fanfare of the Earls Court Boat Show, 
the industry is having to combat an alarming increase in boat 
theft which has become linked with international drug 
trafficking. 
  Stolen high-speed powerboats are being used to transport 
drugs into Britain from offshore rendezvous. Police and marine 
loss adjusters also have evidence that stolen boats have been 
sent in containers to the Caribbean as a new method of 
"laundering" payment for drug consignments to this country. 
  Thefts are not confined to coastal waters. One of the 
worst-hit areas is the Midlands, where boats and trailers are 
stolen from drives on suburban housing estates. 
  Modern manufacturing techniques, in which fibreglass hulls 
are stamped out by the thousand, have brought recreational 
boating within the range of lower middle-class man. They have 
also made it very hard to identify stolen craft because so many 
look identical and registration is not compulsory. 
  "Looking at rows of these boats lined up at marinas is like 
looking at a car park full of Ford Escorts," said one theft 
investigator. "They all look exactly the same. But whereas all 
the Escorts would be on the DVLC computer in Swansea, the boats 
may have little or no means of identification." 
  As boat builders at Earls Court report new confidence in a 
reviving market, an expert in marine loss adjustment estimated 
that around 2,500 boats, worth an estimated &pound;20 million, 
are 
stolen each year in Britain, and the figure is rising. 
  Peter Clarke, head of C-Claims, leading investigators into 
small craft losses, said: "It is a steadily worsening trend. 
Every year sees an increase in the number of thefts. In the 
summer on any one day about 20 boats will be stolen around the 
country.'' 
  "My experience over 20 years in this business is that the 
level of crime rises during a recession and levels out when 
recovery comes--but it never falls." 
  Mr Clarke fears that increased links between boat thieves 
and 
drug traffickers could see an increasing element of violence 
attached to theft. In the Caribbean, families aboard expensive 
boats have been hijacked, thrown overboard and left to drown. 
  "Substantial yachts costing &pound;200,000 or more have been 
stolen and used for drug running," he said. "We came across a 
scam where containers stuffed with stolen speedboats, jet skis 
and four-wheel drive vehicles were to be despatched to Caribbean 
islands. There is no doubt this was meant as direct payment for 
drugs." 
  Peter Cranstone, runs the Personal Watercraft Association, 
which represents the one-man craft better known as jet skis--the 
brand name for the Kawasaki model. These craft, because of their 
small size and popularity, have become a major target for 
organised crime. "They were being stolen and used to pay for 
drug consignments--a new way of laundering payments," he 
explained. 
  But, thanks to an agreement with four of the biggest 
manufacturers, all new craft now carry two or three hidden 
electronic tags--transponders--which react to electronic 
scanners. According to Mr Cranstone the hidden transponders are 
already proving a deterrent. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Michael Prestage: "Police Close in on Dealers at </F>
Heart of Fatal Operation"] 
  [Text] Police believe they know the identity of the dealers 
selling a purer than usual form of heroin in the St Paul's 
district of Bristol, which may have claimed the lives of eight 
addicts. 
  A senior Avon and Somerset officer said that although the 
purer form was available from a number of sources at street 
level, it was thought that further up the drug-dealing chain one 
or two individuals were responsible for distribution. 
  He said; "We have good intelligence linking us to one or two 
names and one or two addresses. We know these dealers have been 
particularly active in recent months.'' 
  "I cannot give too much away, but it is safe to say there is 
an ongoing operation to stop them." 
  Recent high-profile police activity in the area has produced 
40 arrests in 17 days and raids on a number of drug dens. 
  In the latest raid last Thursday evening, seven people were 
arrested and released on police bail. 
  Forensic scientists are analysing 20 "wraps" of a substance 
found during the raid at a high rise flat, on an estate on the 
outskirts of Bristol. 
  The police source said officers were liaising with other 
forces. There are also links with Customs aimed at identifying 
the source of the drug. 
  The heroin trade in the city is largely handled by white 
dealers--crack is considered a black drug--but further up the 
heroin chain, there is believed to be an Asian connection. 
  In Bristol heroin is in plentiful supply, despite police 
efforts. The wholesale street price has dropped by 50 per cent, 
from &pound;32,000 a kilo to &pound;21,000. A fix can be had for 
&pound;10. 
  Heroin as pure as 80 per cent has been recovered in the Avon 
and Somerset force area in recent months. 
  Three deaths have already been confirmed as involving a form 
of the drug which has been analysed as being 63 per cent heroin, 
rather than the usual 40 per cent. 
  The death of a 17-year-old, Ross Hamblin, as well as four 
deaths last year, is also likely to be linked to the purer 
heroin. 
  There are 450 registered addicts in the Bristol area, but a 
recent survey has shown the true figure of addicts to be around 
1,500. 
  Casual users will push the number still higher.

<F P=106> [Press release from the UK Home Office: "UK; Italy Link Up </F>
To Fight"] 
  [Text] Information about illicit drug trafficking will soon 
be exchanged between the UK and Italy using Teledrug--a computer 
system developed in Italy. 
  This latest Anglo-Italian initiative follows a successful 
joint operation on Christmas Eve where 263 kg of cocaine were 
seized in Felixstowe. 
  A Memorandum of Understanding paving the way for UK/Italian 
cooperation on drug trafficking was signed today by 
Assistant-Under Secretary of State at the Police Department, 
John Warne and the Director of the Office for the Coordination 
and Planning of Italian Police, Prefetto Gaetano Piccolella. 
  The Memorandum Will: [subhead] 
  --enable the UK to join the Teledrug computer information 
system; 
  --lead to better cooperation between both countries in 
identifying and apprehending drug traffickers. 
  Home Office Minister of State, Peter Lloyd announced the 
UK's 
intention to join the Teledrug system at the Ministerial 
Conference on European Drug Trafficking Routes, held in Rome in 
May 1993. 
  The UK is the second European Union Member State to join the 
Teledrug system. Greece signed an agreement with Italy last year. 
  Notes To Editors [subhead] 
  1. The Teledrug system was developed by Italy following a 
Ministerial Meeting in Rome in 1990. Participants agreed to 
exchange information about illicit drug trafficking along the 
Balkan Route. The United Kingdom was not present. 
  2. Teledrug came into operation in September 1992, linking 
terminals in Italy and Turkey to a mainframe computer in Rome. 
  3. Teledrug offers a potentially valuable source of 
information. The UK's one year trial of Teledrug will enable an 
evaluation of the system. 
  4. HM Customs and Excise and the National Criminal 
Intelligence Service will operate Teledrug in the UK.

Kozlovskiy under the rubric "Crime Report": "A Selection of 
Poison. Is the Decision of the Former Parliament To Abolish 
Criminal Liability for Drug Use Legitimate?"] 
  [Text] Moscow Oblast--The key went into the lock, the 
lock clicked, and I found myself in a ward of a psychiatric 
hospital. Yet another key, another dry and quiet click, and the 
door closed securely behind me. If I wanted to understand even a 
little of what went on behind this closed door for two months, I 
had to stay calm and be patient for at least one day. 
  Here was a 17-year-old guy from a vocational technical 
school 
who was a roommate of mine. A 30-year-old physician, a 
cardiologist--a former physician, of course--was on another bed, 
next to a barred window. A third patient lay on a made-up bed 
next to the door. He had a most unique tattoo on his completely 
bared chest from which it would be immediately clear to a 
slammer specialist what this man has done time for and for how 
long. 
  All of these people were drug addicts with a history. I was 
"planted" there by the editorial office to write about how they 
had ended up there and how they feel in the "loony bin." 
  Why did the newspaper need this particular crime report? The 
words "drug business" are used with increasing frequency in 
presentations by lawyers and employees of the prosecutor's 
offices and the militia. Some 1.5 million Russians use narcotics 
permanently. Specialists project that this number will double in 
five to six years. The prospects are dismal, especially if we 
take into account the fact that in the last 10 years 
narcotics-related crime has increased by a factor of three. 
  So far, our situation has been different from that in the 
region of the so-called "golden triangle" (Burma, Laos, 
Vietnam). The domestic drug business is not yet on a par with 
the Medellin cartel from South America. However, there is enough 
reason to worry because on issues of crime we frequently also 
find ourselves "ahead of the entire planet." 
  What influenced my roommates in deciding "to get hooked," 
join the "sniffers," or pop "pills" and do "grass?" The 
30-year-old cardiologist injected himself with promedol while 
still a student. Why? His colleague from the institute had 
promised unheard-of bliss. Then he injected himself another 
time, and rolled downhill. He could no longer do without two 
injections a day. Meanwhile, life went on. He graduated from the 
institute and got married. However, on learning that her husband 
was a drug addict, his wife took their 1-year-old daughter along 
and left. His father got sick.... 
  The guy from the vocational technical school painted a 
generally familiar picture. Up to 20 boys got together, poured a 
solvent into plastic bags and, putting in their heads, inhaled 
for several hours until they were spaced out. None of the 
passers-by who are scared of our present-day life and who saw 
them sitting on stairways or in the hallways of homes got 
outraged, tried to stop them, or reported them to the militia. 
  The befuddled youths who inhaled poison engaged in wild 
carnage right there, in front of the houses. Their confused 
minds did not understand that they were beating to death their 
own best friend.... 
  The third one, with tattoos, looked askance at the newcomer. 
He just did not want to acknowledge me as a drug addict who was 
brought in for compulsory treatment. Likewise, I was not 
particularly eager to converse, having learned from the 
physicians the biographic details about this man who had 
repeatedly partaken of the "coziness" of prison bunk beds. After 
committing a serious crime, he was saved from the "highest 
measure" by just one factor--the state of narcotic intoxication 
in which he committed robbery and murder. 
  Finally, he started talking too. I figured out only one 
thing 
from the unintelligible stream of verbiage: he does not intend 
to get off drugs. He will fake having "kicked the habit," get 
out of hospital captivity, and shoot up right away. 
  I looked at him and thought that it would be nice to put, in 
this or another room of the psychiatric hospital, the deputies 
of the former parliament who adopted the decision to cancel 
criminal liability for drug use. I recalled a conversation with 
N. Osipov, the deputy chief of the administration for illegal 
drug trafficking of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
  Nikolay Nikolayevich was indignant: "We consulted even the 
relevant services of the United Nations on this issue. Nobody 
told us that punishing a person for using drugs amounts to an 
encroachment on his personal freedom or an infringement of human 
rights. Yet for some reason they have been persistently trying 
to deprive us of a very serious device for the prevention of 
drug addiction." 
  Meanwhile, an atmosphere of confidence prevailed in the cell 
room. As one of their own, I was already being told about a boy 
who is prepared to commit contract murder for a glass of hashish 
or marijuana. They whispered about a group of drug addicts who 
raped an 8-year-old girl. They discussed news coming in from the 
outside about the apprehension of either drug pushers or 
procurers from whom more than a quintal of "grass" was 
confiscated. 
  As I listened to these revelations, I once again recalled 
our 
conversation at the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia. 
  "If it goes on like this and they turn a blind eye to the 
reality of the drug business, I will not be surprised if they 
officially begin to offer an extensive selection of drugs for 
dessert in restaurants and cafes." Of course, Colonel N. Osipov 
was exaggerating. However, in Saratov, for example, they easily 
showed me places where poison for the soul and the body could be 
purchased without a problem. 
  Personally, I know something else, too. If you want to buy 
more "supplies," you make tracks for Saransk. If you need 
cheaper merchandise, you slip through to Almaty. 
  One in five uncovered groups dealing in drugs had 
excellently 
established interregional connections. Some groups numbered up 
to 50 members. It is only our inviolable Union that has fallen 
apart. The criminal commonwealth has only grown stronger. Here, 
"international obligations" are met precisely and on time. Some 
supply raw materials, others process them, still others sell 
them or find room to store them. 
  N. Osipov believes that "for now, we are being saved by two 
circumstances. Domestic drug addicts have not been spoiled, they 
use the simplest types of drugs, and frequently surrogates.'' 
  "The second aspect is like this. Major operators have not 
yet 
been drawn into the Russian drug trade. For now, 30-40 percent 
of drug addicts procure the poison themselves. As it were, wild 
hemp occupies more than 1 million hectares." 
  I asked Osipov: "So, it turns out that it is not too late 
yet? And there is no reason for them to intimidate the common 
citizens with the gloomy figure of a narcotics trafficker?" 
  Osipov said: "No. As the saying goes, the process has gotten 
underway here, too...." 
  Had my roommates known what kind of information I had, their 
jaws would perhaps have dropped as they listened. After all, I 
was aware of quite specific cases, rather than criminal 
gossip--the case of a dangerous repeat offender setting up an 
underground laboratory for drug production, for example. 
  The operation in St. Petersburg was even more successful. A 
highly skilled company got together there which was headed by a 
research associate of an institute on the banks of the Neva. 
They manufactured a synthetic drug of such potency that it is 
now being talked about not only on the banks of the Neva. 
  However, there was no reason for me to share this knowledge, 
nor was there any time. A nurse came and let me out.

<F P=106> [Report from the "Inform" roundup: "`Big Fish' Comes Down </F>
From a High"] 
  [Text] A targeted drug-busting operation was carried out 
last week by staff from the Moscow Internal Affairs Main 
Administration. They uncovered three opium manufacturing 
laboratories and confiscated 150 kg of poppy haulms, almost 1.5 
liters of opium solution, and a Kalashnikov rifle. The 
operatives discovered the largest haul at a house on Kerch 
Street: A certain Gubanov was found in possession of 97 kg of 
poppy haulms. 
  But it was detectives from the regional administration for 
combating organized crime who provided the high point of the 
operation. They basically brought to an end the "high" enjoyed 
by a Georgian criminal community resident in the "Rossiyanochka" 
Hotel on Leninskiy Prospekt. Seven addicts were caught 
red-handed.

"Large Drugs Syndicate `Caught'"] 
  [Text] An underground group which included students and 
even one member of the Kazan University scientific council has 
been rendered harmless by the joint efforts of the Russian and 
Tatarstan ministries of internal affairs. 
  They spent a long time preparing to catch the drugs 
manufacturers. A KRIM-PRESS correspondent was told by Vasiliy 
Varlamov, a staffer at the Tatarstan Internal Affairs Ministry 
press center, that, having developed an original method, with no 
analogue abroad, for obtaining a very powerful 
narcotic--trimetilfentonil [as transliterated] (China white), 
the criminals shipped it from Russia to Azerbaijan and beyond. 
  During the investigation new facts are continuing to be 
uncovered and additional arrests made. 
  A new type of crime is on the rise in Tatarstan: Over the 
past year 300 people have been arrested in the republic. 
Confiscated from them were 400 kg of poppy stems, 10 kg of 
grass [zelenaya massa konopli], 15 kg of marijuana, 90 kg of 
opium, and medicines containing narcotic substances. The most 
terrible aspect of crime of this type is the participation of 
juveniles, who make up one tenth of those arrested.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Grachev report under the "Crime" rubric: "`What </F>
Business of Mine Are Other People's Kids?'"] 
  [Text] Bryansk -- The Bryansk border area has become a 
reliable barrier to drugs being transported in passenger trains 
from nearby foreign countries to Moscow. 
  "A particularly large number of inhabitants of Moldova and 
Ukraine are now in pursuit of ill-gotten gains from this," 
Customhouse Chief A. Lyulin said. "Narcotic substances have 
simply been flooding in from there. Judge for yourselves: 
Whereas in the whole of last year we discovered 574 kg, this 
year we discovered 560 kg in January alone! And we are among 
the leading Russian customhouses in terms of drugs seizures..." 
  The figures, of course, are not gratifying. They transport 
narcotics even in railcar hatches and coal bunkers. 
  The customs officials' haul was the biggest yet: 360 kgs of 
poppy haulms was seized from gypsies on the Chisinau-Moscow 
train. They naturally disowned the goods and pretended to be 
illiterate to avoid reading or signing the seizure warrant. 
  But the customs officials were particularly taken aback by 
the fact that this dreadful product was being transported to the 
capital by a woman with 14 children. Brandishing her 
heroine-mother papers, she expressed loud indignation at the 
confiscation. 
  "How can you sell a substance which will kill babies and 
future mothers?"--a young customs official asked her. 
  "What business of mine are other people's kids?" she spat 
out.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] But today, the chief drug 
addiction specialist of Latvia, Janis Strazdins, acquainted the 
gathering with the situation at present in Latvia. 
  [Begin Strazdins recording] The situation in Latvia is 
becoming alarming. In January of this year our criminal police 
conducted the first cocaine inspection purchase. This means 
that they checked the information--was it true, was there indeed 
cocaine in Latvia? Yes, there is already cocaine in Latvia. It 
is the most terrible narcotic substance that one is able at all 
to imagine, which causes an exceedingly strong dependence. 
  The only, well, one must say, fortune of our poor people is 
that it is very expensive. But it is here. 
  Whereas previously we had widespread drug addiction among 
the 
criminal element, then at present narcotics has become 
especially widespread among the young people. We have such 
endemic hotbeds where it is especially widespread. These is the 
Latgale suburb of our city of Riga, the town of Olaine, to a 
certain extent also the Kurzeme suburb [of Riga], there is 
already a little in the Vidzeme suburb [of Riga]. At present, 
drug addiction is beginning to spread in Jurmala, in Tukums, in 
Rezekne, in Liepaja, and in Daugavpils. But, unfortunately, we 
do not know the true extent of drug addiction in Latvia. I 
would guess 6-10,000, which is a more or less objective data, 
because this is our criminal police data. The young people will 
be compelled to steal, to rob, and sooner or later they will be 
caught, because it is not possible to buy such expensive 
narcotic substances with one's wages. [end recording]

  [Text] Vilnius, Feb 18, BNS -- The number of registered 
drug addicts in Lithuania is 495, but police officials suppose 
that the actual figure is at least 10 times as big. 
  The most widespread narcotics in Lithuania are drugs made of 
poppy. 
  Last year, the police confiscated 963 kilograms of ground 
poppy heads but only 4.5 grams of marijuana and 1.7 grams of 
hashish. These figures do not reflect the actual situation in 
Lithuania either, experts say. 
  Drug smugglers are detained by Lithuanian border officials 
on 
extremely rare occasions. The police catches drug peddlers only 
during special operations. 
  41 citizens of Russia, 10 Azerbaijanians, 6 Ukrainians, 4 
Georgians and 4 Uzbeks were caught attempting to sell drugs in 
Lithuania last year. The RESPUBLIKA newspaper said citizens of 
Great Britain and Denmark were detained for attempting to 
smuggle drugs. 
  Opium has become a quite frequent narcotic in Lithuania 
lately. Police officials suppose that pure opium started coming 
in quite recently. As a rule, opium is delivered from 
Uzbekistan through Belarusian territory. Lithuanian authorities 
confiscated 633 grams of pure opium last year and already a 
kilogram this year. 
  According to police reports, at least 10 criminal gangs 
produced and distributed drugs in Lithuania until recently. 
Part of these gangs were eliminated with the application of the 
law on preventive detention.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Shirochenko: "The Fate of European Drug </F>
Mafia Is Being Resolved in Strasbourg"] 
  [Text] The second European Conference on Fighting the Use 
and Spread of Narcotics has taken place in Strasbourg, France. 
The conference was attended by people from 40 countries, 
including Ukraine. The Ukrainian delegation was headed by 
Militia Colonel General Valentyn Nedryhaylo, first deputy 
interior minister. There is good reason for the attention paid 
by the EC to the problem of narcotics. Today, drug lords are 
acting on a large scale, expanding their spheres of influence 
and trapping thousands of new victims in their nets. 
  According to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry, the number of 
drug addicts in Ukraine has reached 400,000. They consume five 
tonnes of deadly substances every day, spending almost 80 
billion karbovantsi. In light of the fact that the "traditional" 
routes of shipping drugs stretch close to our territory, members 
of the Italian and Colombian drug Mafia have already held 
consultations about using these channels for selling their 
products. The documents adopted, and concrete measures outlined 
by the conference will facilitate the launching of an attack 
against the drug Mafia in the very near future. However, the 
efforts of law enforcement bodies alone are not sufficient. 
That is why the participants in the forum passed a decision to 
support all public organizations in the fight against the use 
and trafficking of drugs.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan 21 KYODO -- Timber producing and 
consuming countries have basically agreed to establish a new 
fund for sustainable management of tropical forests, Japanese 
Government sources said Friday [21 January]. 
  They reached an accord during negotiations in Geneva to 
revise the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA). 
  The new agreement will place more emphasis on preservation 
of 
tropical forests than the present accord which came into effect 
in 1984 and will expire in March this year, the sources said. 
  Both sides have agreed to specify that trade of tropical 
timber be from products from forests under sustainable 
management by the year 2000, the sources said. 
  Representatives of 36 producing nations such as Indonesia 
and 
Malaysia, and 33 consuming countries, including Japan and the 
United States, have been negotiating in Geneva since January 10 
for revising the agreement. 
  The compromise has been reached as producing nations have 
withdrawn demand for consuming nations to abide by the same 
principles of sustainable management for temperate forests on 
their own land. 
  In return, consuming nations will be obliged to issue a 
joint 
statement on cutting down their own forests, with consideration 
given to the environment, as well as set up the new fund, the 
sources said. 
  Japan, whose imports of tropical forest timber are the 
world's largest at 15 million cubic meters a year, will be 
requested to take more responsibility in extending financial aid 
to developing nations through the fund, the sources said. 
  The International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), which 
is in charge of keeping the ITTA, is headquartered in Yokohama.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan 12 KYODO -- Officials of nine ministries 
and agencies met Wednesday [12 January] to begin planning 
Japan's response to the convention on biological diversity, an 
international legal instrument for the conservation and use of 
the earth's biological resources. 
  The coordinating committee will meet regularly to develop a 
national strategy to maintain biodiversity domestically and 
overseas. 
  It will also discuss proposals to take to the first 
conference of countries which are parties to the treaty 
scheduled for November. 
  That conference will consider ways to fund developing 
countries' efforts to maintain biodiversity as well as consider 
policy on the transfer of biotechnology. 
  The treaty, which came into effect last year, was drawn up 
at 
the United Nations-sponsored earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 
June, 1992. Forty-nine countries have signed the treaty. 
  Policy measures developed by the committee will be combined 
with measures adopted at the November conference for 
incorporation in an overall national strategy by the end of the 
year. 
  The treaty covers the protection of endangered species, 
access to biological resources for commercial use, and the 
maintenance of the world's species' genetic pool.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan 12 KYODO -- Japan and South Korea will 
hold a meeting in Tokyo next Monday to discuss bilateral 
cooperation to protect the environment, the Foreign Ministry 
said Wednesday [12 January]. 
  The meeting is the first to be held under a treaty on 
cooperation to preserve the environment signed between the two 
countries last June. 
  Japanese officials from the Foreign Ministry, the 
Environment 
Agency, the Science and Technology Agency and the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry will attend the meeting, the 
ministry said. 
  The South Korean delegation includes officials from the 
Foreign, Science and Technology and Environment Ministries. 
  The participants will discuss each nation's environment 
polices and bilateral and multilateral cooperation on 
environmental problems, it said. 
  Japan is expected to propose joint projects including 
monitoring acid rain, apparently caused by emissions from China, 
and research on pollution in the Sea of Japan, such as that 
caused by Russia's dumping of nuclear waste, Japanese officials 
said. 
  Tokyo and Seoul will also discuss South Korea's request for 
Japan to help in the recycling and disposal of industrial waste, 
the officials said. 
  The Japan-South Korea accord covers research on acid rain, 
air pollution, global warming, the preservation of ecosystems 
and biodiversity. 
  Under the agreement, the conference will be held annually, 
alternating between Japan and South Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan 28 KYODO -- Japan and Russia have agreed 
to cooperate on 17 projects on environmental conservation such 
as joint studies on acid rain and air pollution, Foreign 
Ministry officials said Friday [28 January]. 
  The two sides reached the agreement during a three-day 
Japan-Russia joint committee meeting on environmental 
conservation at the Foreign Ministry, the officials said. 
  They also agreed to hold a second joint committee meeting in 
Russia sometime in the first half of 1995 to review the progress 
of the projects and hammer out new ones, they said. 
  The meeting in Tokyo was the first to be held based on an 
accord in 1991 on environmental conservation between Japan and 
the then Soviet Union. 
  Moscow and Tokyo had agreed to hold the meeting annually but 
were unable to because of Russia's domestic situation, the 
officials said. 
  Issei Nomura, director general of the ministry's European 
and 
Oceanian Affairs Bureau, headed the Japanese delegation. 
  Officials from the Environment Agency, the Science and 
Technology Agency, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry and other related ministries also attended. 
  The Russian side was headed by Yuriy Kazakov, director 
general of the International Cooperation Bureau of the Ministry 
of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. 
  The joint projects to be conducted in 1994 and 1995 include 
joint studies on acid rain, the quality of water of Lake Baikal, 
the environment of the Sea of Japan, and observation of the 
greenhouse effect in Siberia. 
  The program also includes joint observation of methane gas 
from frozen land regions and exchange of information to prevent 
air pollution in both countries, the officials said. 
  Also during the meeting, the two sides discussed each 
nation's administration and policies concerning environment, as 
well as domestic and global environmental problems, they said. 
  Specifically, they discussed air and water pollution, 
disposal of wastes, global warming, and protection of 
biodiversity and the ozone layer, the officials said. 
  The two sides did not discuss Russia's dumping of nuclear 
waste into the Sea of Japan since it was not on the agenda, they 
said. 
  The Japanese and Russian officials agreed that cooperation 
between the two nations is important for environmental 
preservation and that cooperation in the field could contribute 
to the improvement of bilateral relations as a whole, the 
officials said.

  [Text] In preparation for the possibility of a large-scale 
oil spill in the territorial waters off the Korean peninsula as 
a result of the increasing amount of oil transport via the sea, 
the government has decided to make efforts to establish a 
Northeast Asian cooperative system to prevent ocean pollution. 
These Asian countries include the ROK, North Korea, Japan, 
China, and Russia. 
  The relevant ministries, including the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs and Environment and the Korea Maritime and Port 
Administration, said on 9 January that for this end, the 
government would participate in the Northwest-Pacific Ocean 
protection program, a regional cooperative system jointly led by 
the UN Environment Program and International Maritime 
Organization, and that it is positively considering signing an 
agreement to prevent ocean pollution. 
  Accordingly, the government will participate in a meeting of 
the program led by those five countries. This meeting is 
scheduled to be held in May for the first time. In the meeting, 
the government will ask other participating countries to 
establish a comprehensive information management system 
regarding the maritime environment in the Northwest-Pacific 
region, including the East Sea and the Yellow Sea, and to 
formulate an inter-state cooperative plan to prepare for a 
large-scale oil spill. It will give a high priority to this 
project. 
  Also, the government will hold the first working-level 
contact with Japan in Tokyo next month and mainly discuss plans 
to cooperate with Japan to prevent oil spills. The discussions 
will include ``the conclusion of an agreement, the exchange of 
technology and information, and the exchange of manpower and 
equipment between the ROK and Japan for the prevention of ocean 
pollution'' in case there is a large-scale oil spill on the 
waters.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan 14 (YONHAP) -- Just when the country 
appeared to have run out of hot political issues, drinking water 
contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals gushed out of faucets 
in households in Pusan and other cities along the Naktong River, 
making big waves among government leaders and politicians. 
  President Kim Yong-sam promised Friday that his 
administration will work out short- and long-term measures to 
clean up the country's water resources so that all citizens are 
able to drink safe and clean water. 
  ``Government officials should not just follow the inertia of 
the past administrations, but tell environmental and health 
problems to the citizenry,'' he said, apparently blaming 
previous administrations for today's water pollution. 
  The people, for their part, should actively contribute to 
national efforts to clean up water resources by not dumping 
garbage and liquid waste into rivers, Kim said. 
  Ruling and opposition parties, meanwhile, hastily dispatched 
fact-finding missions to South Kyongsang Province while forming 
party committees to debate the problem. 
  They sharply criticized the administration for leaving the 
state of pollution in the Naktong River as it is today. 
  Both the ruling Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] and main 
opposition Democratic Party [DP] failed, however, to come up 
with any suggestion or alternative action for the administration 
to take immediately. 
  It was the stench emanating from the tap water in homes in 
Pusan and other cities in lower South Kyongsang Province, and 
complaints by citizens that alerted government officials to look 
into the woeful state of pollution of the Naktong River earlier 
this week. 
  Showing the situation to be even worse than feared, 
government officials announced Thursday that they had found 
traces of cancer-causing benzene and other chemicals in the 
Naktong River, from which tap water is drawn, raising grave 
concern among people in the area. 
  The parties have decided that the National Assembly Health 
and Social Affairs Committee will hold a hearing Saturday to 
grill the responsible government officials and try to work out 
measures to clean up the mess. 
  The DLP convened an unscheduled meeting of party postholders 
Friday morning and discussed the problem but could not make any 
concrete suggestion to the government. 
  ``I have nothing to announce,'' DLP spokesman Ha Sun-pong 
said after the meeting. ``We just exchanged our concerns.'' 
  ``Right now, the administration is working on measures among 
the ministries concerned,'' he said. ``The party will make an 
overall and comprehensive action plan after listening to them.'' 
  DLP Secretary-general Mun Chong-su acknowledged that the 
government and ruling party should have done something about the 
Naktong River pollution three years ago, when an industrial 
company was caught dumping phenol into the river. 
  The DLP is resolved, he said, to support the government in 
its efforts to clean up pollution not only in the Naktong but 
all the rivers in the country. 
  The Democratic Party, calling the Naktong River pollution 
the 
worst man-made disaster in the nation's history, demanded that 
the government take fundamental action. 
  ``Some 10 million people in southern South Kyongsang 
Province 
have been drinking water contaminated by cancer-causing 
chemicals,'' DP spokesman Pak Chi-won said. 
  ``The government should trace those responsible for the 
contamination and arrest them immediately while making efforts 
to prevent further pollution,'' he said. 
  DP members of the Health and Social Affairs Committee will 
use the findings of a party investigation team sent down to the 
area Thursday in questioning government officials. 
  The opposition party, taking the position that the Naktong 
River ``disaster'' is a direct result of a lack of government 
environmental measures and lack of supervision, pressed again 
its demand for an extraordinary assembly session in January.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Japan have 
decided to undertake 31 cooperative projects in the 
environmental area, the Foreign Ministry reported on Tuesday. 
  A Ministry official said the decision was made at the first 
Korea-Japan joint environmental cooperation committee meeting 
held in Tokyo on Monday. 
  South Korean delegates asked Japan at the meeting to 
promote, 
among others, the exchange of water preservation experts, and 
Japan promised to favorably review it. 
  The two sides also agreed on the need for Northeast Asian 
countries to promote closer environmental cooperation in the 
region. 
  The Korean delegation to the Tokyo meeting was led by Yi 
Tae-sik, Foreign Ministry's deputy director-general for 
international economy.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan 19 (YONHAP) -- Seven in ten South Koreans 
are willing to pay an additional tax for the better preservation 
of environment, a recent opinion poll showed on Wednesday. 
  A survey held by Tongso Research Institute in a contract 
awarded by the Daewoo Economic Institute revealed that 70.1 
percent of the total respondents said they were willing to pay a 
new environment-related tax. 
  The poll was taken for three months beginning August last 
year toward 10,463 persons aged 18 or older in six major cities 
and seven provinces across the country. 
  Of the total pollees, 51.1 percent or 3,747 persons said 
they 
could pay 4,000 won or less a year for the preservation of 
environment, 29.3 percent (2,149 persons) 5,000 to 9,000 won, 
16.5 percent (1,209 persons) 10,000 to 40,000 won, 2.2 percent 
(106 persons) 50,000 to 90,000 won, and 1 percent (69 persons) 
more than 100,000 won. 
  By sex, 71.9 percent of all male respondents showed 
willingness to pay an environmental tax. When it came to women, 
the percentage was 68.5 percent, the poll showed.

<F P=106> [Report by Kim Tae-yong] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Jan 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Japan are 
studying ways to cope with acid rain and sulfurous acid gas 
coming on the wind from China, and this issue will be on the 
agenda when the Korea-Japan joint committee on environmental 
cooperation meets 17 January in Tokyo. 
  Foreign and domestic studies show that airborne pollutants 
from China account for 30 percent to 50 percent of the acid rain 
that falls upon Korea and Japan, and Seoul signed environmental 
protection pacts with Tokyo and Beijing in June and October last 
year, respectively, to improve environmental cooperation with 
its neighbors. 
  No Chae-sik, president of the Korea Environmental Technology 
Research Institute, has proposed to President Kim Yong-sam that 
there be strict examination of pollutants from China as research 
by domestic and foreign scholars shows that China accounts for 
30 percent of Korea's air pollution. 
  Sim Shang-ku, senior research scientist of the Environment 
Research Center in the Korea Institute of Science and Technology 
(KIST), says recent research by Japan's Central Research 
Institute for Electric Power Industries shows that at least 50 
percent of the materials causing acid rain in Japan are from 
China. 
  The Japanese institute published the results of its research 
on Chinese pollutants in November 1992. It traced the roots of 
sulfureted ions, which cause acid rain, observed at 20 measuring 
points in Japan and found that 50 percent of the ions were from 
China, 15 percent from South Korea and the remainder from Japan. 
  Professor Kim Chong-uk of Seoul National University's 
Graduate School of Environmental Study said in a paper last year 
that the sulfurous acid gas produced in Beijing and two other 
cities and 14 provinces on China's east coast has a great effect 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  ``About 92 percent of the sulfurous acid gas from China 
becomes acid rain while the remaining 8 percent affects the 
earth in the form of gas,'' he wrote. ``Shandong and Liaoning 
Provinces, where factories are clustered, especially affect this 
peninsula very much.'' 
  If the wind blows from China, the acidity of the rain 
falling 
on Paengnyong island off the west coast reaches PH 5.0, he said. 
  South Korea is studying exactly how much sulfurous acid gas 
and acid rain is coming from China, and how much damage they 
cause. 
  Seeking precise data, the National Institute of 
Environmental 
Research will begin a three-year examination of air pollutants 
blown from China and acid rain, using planes, from spring. 
[sentence as received] 
  Professor Yi Kyong-chae of Seoul City University says that 
acid rain appeared only in Seoul and some industrial areas until 
three to four years ago. But these days, acid rain also falls 
in rural areas, including Kwangneung in Kyonggi Province and 
west Kangwon Province. 
  ``Unless the government devises countermeasures against acid 
rain caused by pollutants coming from China as soon as possible, 
most of South Korea's pine trees will suffer irreparable 
damage,'' Yi says. 
  The reason for China's acid rain is that 76 percent of its 
total energy comes from burning coal, which contains a lot of 
sulfur. In 1991, China discharged 16.22 million tons of 
sulfurous acid gas into the atmosphere, about 15 times as much 
as South Korea. 
  China made rapid economic progress in 1992 and 1993, and the 
consumption of coal, of which it has an enormous amount, soared. 
  Seoul National University's Graduate School of Environmental 
Study expects that until 2022, when China's per capita gross 
national product (GNP) will reach 4,000 U.S. dollars, the amount 
of sulfurous acid gas will keep increasing. 
  In contrast, the sulfurous acid gas generated in Korea has 
been dropping since 1990, when desulfurization facilities and 
clean energy were introduced by industry. 
  As time passes, the damage Korea suffers from Chinese 
pollution will grow, according to researchers. 
  To reduce the pollution from China, the Environment Ministry 
has held three Northeast Asian environment conferences, but 
China appears reluctant to do anything about its emissions lest 
economic growth suffer and says that it lacks the capital and 
technology to deal with the problem. 
  In Europe, where 50 percent of airborne pollutants migrate 
across national boundaries, 33 countries signed the convention 
on transboundary air pollutants in 1979. 
  Canada and the United States concluded an agreement to 
sharply reduce air pollutants causing acid rain in 1990.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Because of the report of 
``acid rain'' in Samut Prakan Province, which lies next to 
Bangkok, there has been broad interest and many requests for 
more information from our readers. THAN SETTHAKIT correspondents 
have reported on the progress of this situation, and a source in 
the Office of the National Commission for Energy Policy (SPhCh) 
revealed that a check on large factories in Samut Prakan 
indicated that many used furnace oil with 3.5 percent sulfur. 
This was thought to be the cause for the ``acid rain'' problem. 
In addition to the Phra Nakhon Tai [South Bangkok] electrical 
plant, it was found that there were 37 factories out of the 
approximately 3,000 in Samut Prakan which released from 21.6 
tons per year to 1,720 tons per year of sulfur dioxide. The 
trend was for these factories to release more sulfur dioxide 
every year. 
  ``Those in industry still do not feel that it is important 
to 
deal with acid rain and are not prepared to switch from high- to 
low sulfur furnace oil. They generally claim that it would 
increase costs. Therefore we will probably need some procedure 
to induce these factories to change so that the problem can be 
solved,'' the source felt. 
  The same source said that at present the government did not 
have any procedures to compel them to reduce sulfur dioxide 
emissions. And the standard for sulfur dioxide of 300 micrograms 
per cubic meter was a standard for testing the atmosphere. No 
procedure had been specified for measuring the release of sulfur 
dioxide by individual facilities. Also, there was no procedure 
for punishing violators. These were the problems which made it 
difficult to avoid pollution. 
  As for the 37 large factories mentioned, these were 
generally 
in heavy industry and included the Thai-Asahi Glass Factory, the 
Ajinomoto MSG Factory, the Krungthep Steel Factory, Thai Phatana 
Steel, as well as paper mills and textile factories. Mr. Prasoet 
Bunsamphan, the Deputy Director of the Petroleum Authority of 
Thailand(PTT), made an interesting point. At the beginning of 
last October the PTT had signed a contract to sell 3,600 million 
liters of furnace oil with a sulfur content of 3.5 percent to 
the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) over 3 
years for about 10,400 million baht to supply the Phranakhon Tai 
electrical plant and the Bang Pakong electrical plant. This was 
in addition to the 28,955 million liters normally supplied to 
the KFPh. 
  According to the signed contract, the PTT is to bring in 
furnace oil with 3.5 percent sulfur content but may substitute 
furnace oil with less sulfur for an additional 30 to 35 satang 
per liter if EGAT is willing to use it. This could increae the 
price of electricity by 1 to 1.5 satang per unit. When one 
calculates the increase in expense and considers that the 
government does not have any policy of supporting this through 
reduced import duties for low-sulfur furnace oil, then one can 
see that this might be very difficult for EGAT. 
  At present the Phra Nakhon Tai electrical plant and the Phra 
Nakhon Neua [North Bangkok] electrical plant use 2,600 million 
liters per year of 3.5 percent sulfur furnace oil. The factories 
in Bangkok and Samut Prakan use 1,300 million liters per year. 
In the past the PTT imported 50 million liters of 2 percent 
sulfur furnace oil for the Phra Nakhon Tai electrical plant. 
This apparently created a burden inasmuch as the price was 
higher than the contracted price. If the government adopted 
measures to compel factories in both Bangkok and Samut Prakan to 
use low-sulfur oil, this burden would disappear because they 
would be able to shift the burden of the price of the furnace 
oil which met standards onto the factories instead. 
  ``If EGAT should import low-sulfur furnace oil, although it 
might appear that all the burden was shifted to it or the 
factories, in fact in the past the price of 3 percent sulfur 
furnace oil has been higher: U.S.$15 to U.S.$17 per barrel -- 
whereas now the price has dropped to only U.S.$11 to U.S.$12 per 
barrel. If 2 percent sulfur furnace oil were imported, the 
investment would be 30 to 35 satang per liter higher, but this 
would still be lower than when the price of furnace oil was high 
as in the past,'' Mr. Prasoet said. 
  The EGAT deputy director also said that the Commission for 
Considering a National Energy Policy, chaired by Dr. Sawit 
Phothiwihok, minister attached to the Prime Minister's Office, 
was considering making an announcement compelling factories both 
in Bangkok and Samut Prakan to use low-sulfur oil with 2 percent 
sulfur. But there was still the problem that many factories were 
not willing to use it. Nevertheless the announcement is expected 
this November. 
  Mr. Yothin Tanthansakun, the Director of the Division for 
Safety and the Environment of the Toyota Motor Company 
(Thailand) Ltd., offered information worth following up on: if 
Samut Prakan pollution damages the finish of the company's 
already assembled cars this season, the company would correct 
this by applying wax to prevent corrosion. To be sure about 
this, he said that ``Toyota officials are checking to see if 
acid rain is causing this damage.''

  [Text] The Department of Medical Sciences has checked and 
found toxic chemicals, including both lead and mercury, 
polluting the water in the area of the industrial estates. 
  Dr. Panya Sonkhom, the Director of the Department of Medical 
Sciences of the Ministry of Public Health, said that 116 water 
samples had been taken from the waterways which pass by the 
various factories in the Maptaphut and Laemchabang Industrial 
Estates and flow close to populated areas. The samples had been 
taken each month for 14 months [sic] from March 1991 to February 
1992. They were analyzed for toxic chemicals which would be 
dangerous to the health of the people in these watersheds. The 
analysis did not find any PCB's in any of the samples, but lead 
was found in 37 of the samples or 31.7 percent, and mercury was 
found in 19 of the samples or 16.4 percent. 
  Dr. Panya said that among the samples in which lead and 
mercury were found, there were samples which exceeded the 
standard for the maximum level allowed for waste water, namely, 
there was one sample with lead over 20 micrograms per deciliter, 
and there was one sample with mercury over 0.5 micrograms per 
liter. Even though this survey did not find any PCB's, a cancer 
causing substance, and found lead and mercury which exceeded the 
standards set in only one sample each, nevertheless the 
department would continue to check for toxic chemicals in the 
environment, and it had requested assistance on a continuing 
basis from other units involved to help keep track of 
environmental pollution in order to support the development of 
the eastern seaboard and to avoid health hazards for the people 
in this area in the future.

  [Text] [Letter from the Thai Ambassador to Burma, 
Wirasak Futrakun] 
  I have read the editorial column entitled, ``Burma 
[Myanmar] dams are clearly a crime against humanity,'' that 
appeared in THE NATION on 15 November 1993 with deep concern 
that your distinguished newspaper might not have been correctly 
informed about the hydroelectric projects along the Thai-Myanmar 
borders. As someone who knows something about these projects, I 
would like to clarify the status of these projects in order to 
allay some of your anxiety as follows: 
  1. It is true that seven projects have been identified for 
possible cooperation between Thailand and Myanmar since 
hydro-power is clean and renewable comparing to other sources of 
energy such as nuclear reactors or coals. It is not true that 
feasibility studies for seven of these projects have already 
been carried out. So far, only one feasibility study has been 
carried out. 
  2. At present, there exists no agreement between Thailand 
and 
Myanmar regarding the construction of the Salwin hydro-electric 
project. The decision to go ahead with the construction of this 
project must await a feasibility study which will take a few 
years and will include as part and parcel of the feasibility 
study an environmental impact assessment. Even now, there 
exists no agreement between the two countries on the 
implementation of a feasibility study of this project. 
  3. If and when there is a mutual agreement between Thailand 
and Myanmar regarding the Salwin hydroelectric project, the 
aforementioned environmental impact assessment will definitely 
take into consideration any impacts on the peoples living along 
that river, be they Karens, Shans, Paos, Was and many other 
ethnic groups. The dams, should they be built, may not even be 
located in the areas where some of the Karens are living along 
the Thai-Myanmar borders since there are several possible sites 
along this long river. 
  4. The present Government of the Union of Myanmar is just as 
environmentally conscious as the Thai Government. The decision 
of the Government of the Union of Myanmar to terminate timber 
concessions along the Thai-Myanmar border is based on its 
concern to conserve the forests along the border which happen 
also to be watersheds for several of Thailand's own rivers. 
Although this decision has caused pain to many Thai logging 
companies, the Government of Myanmar also sacrifice revenues of 
more than two hundred million dollars per year in order to 
conserve these forests. We should respect their decision and 
should realize that a government that is willing to sacrifice 
such large revenues given its relatively small foreign exchange 
reserves for the sake of preserving its environment is unlikely 
to agree to any hydroelectric projects without undertaking prior 
environmental impact assessment and securing environmental 
safeguards. 
  5. As for the Karens living along the Thai-Myanmar borders, 
their fate is not limited to being, as THE NATION puts it, 
``forced into making a terrible choice between living in Slorc 
[State Law and Order Restoration Council] concentration camps or 
Thai refugee camps.'' First of all, there are more Karens living 
in other parts of Myanmar such as the Ayeyarwaddy Division than 
along the Thai-Myanmar border and they are living not in 
``concentration camps'' but in towns and villages similar to 
other 135 ethnic groups that comprise the people of Myanmar. 
Second, they can enter into negotiations with the Government of 
the Union of Myanmar as other ethnic groups such as the Kachins, 
the Was and the Kokangs have done so successfully in securing 
their autonomous areas and their ways of life. I sincerely hope 
that they will choose this option of negotiations instead of 
prolonging the war that has gone on nearly half a century, and 
has already brought about three or four lost generations of 
Karens, who could have been devoting themselves to develop the 
Karen State in the framework of the Union of Myanmar. 
  It is in Thailand's interest that there be national 
reconciliation with dignity among all the ethnic groups in 
Myanmar because a peaceful and prosperous Myanmar will be the 
best possible neighbour for Thailand.

  [Text] Vietnam this year aims not to export wood in 
exchange for hard currency. It is trying to prevent further 
loss of forest cover. Minister of Forestry Nguyen Quang Ha 
recalled recent instructions by the prime minister banning the 
export of semi- finished materials intensive wood products. 
[sentence as heard] The minister also said the government might 
import wood in the years to come to boost local processing; this 
needs to be effectively administered and not to be an excuse for 
further deforestation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Dr. Zlatko Binenfeld, reserve </F>
Croatian Army general and adviser to Croatian Defense Minister, 
by Mate Piskor: ``Tuzla and Vitez Are Ecological Bombs''] 
  [Excerpts] Reporting from the fronts in Croatia and later 
also from those in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croatian media on 
numerous occasions has alleged that the Serbian and the Muslim 
forces have been using chemical agents banned since 1925 by 
international convention. However, there has been very little 
credible evidence and this has been the reason why the Croatian 
Army so far has not openly reported it, stresses Professor Dr. 
Zlatko Binenfeld, reserve general of the Croatian Army and the 
defense minister's adviser for research and military-technical 
development. 
  Piskor: General, your lecture on the application 
of chemical welfare in the clashes in the former Yugoslavia, 
which was given at Croatian Defense Ministry last week, has 
perplexed the public. Why did you present it to the public in 
such a shocking way and why only now? 
  Binenfeld: You see, I am a scientist and I always 
insist that each claim must be supported by the appropriate 
evidence. There had been no material evidence for the use of 
chemical agents in Croatia even though there was much talk about 
it. We have the evidence now and we are presenting it to the 
public. This involves an Oganj rocket filled with the CS 
[chlorobenzamalonitride] chemical agent, which landed near 
Pokupski a year and a half ago and a hand grenade filled with 
the same chemical agent that was recently found near Zadar. 
<H5>  Shocking Information </H5>
  Piskor: You have stated that the former Yugoslav 
National Army has approximately 100 tonnes of CS at its 
disposal. How great a danger does this represent? 
  Binenfeld: Before I give a specific answer, I must 
explain something. I have been studying the problems of 
protection from chemical agents for 42 years. I have lectured 
at the Military Medical Academy and the Military Technical 
Faculty in Zagreb, I was an adviser to the former Yugoslav 
Government on the Disarmament Committee in Geneva, and a 
participant and lecturer at numerous international conventions 
on the use of and protection from chemical agents. Despite 
this, I did not know what the Yugoslav National Army was 
manufacturing in Bijelo Polje near Mostar. I thought that that 
they were manufacturing quantities of chemical agents that were 
only sufficient for protection tests, but in fact they 
manufactured large quantities. General Tus, the commander of 
the air force of the former Yugoslav National Army in Mostar, 
was not informed either, and not even the omniscient CIA had any 
such notion. [passage omitted] 
  Piskor: There is growing evidence that chemical 
agents are being used in the clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
that the Muslim forces are using it increasingly often against 
the Croats. What is your view? 
  Binenfeld: This whole business about the use of 
chemical agents in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I consider the use of 
chlorine to be a chemical agent, started long ago with 
Silajdzic's statement that, if given no other choice, they would 
use chlorine as a weapon. He threatened to poison all Europe 
with chlorine and similar nonsense. Had he used the chlorine in 
Tuzla he would have killed his own people first, because a 
chemical agent kills unselectively, and especially pays no 
attention to ethnicity. 
  But they really do have 500 tonnes of chlorine in Tuzla and 
now comes the most dangerous bit about it. They have threatened 
to use chlorine against the Serbs and the Serbs have accused 
them of actually doing so. However, this is not certain because 
UN experts have found smoke boxes and not bombs filled with 
chlorine. However, they have used chlorine against the Croats 
several times. 
  When we started to receive the initial reports about the use 
of chlorine-filled bombs in Vitez and Busovaca, for a long time 
we would not allow this to be revealed to the public until we 
held what we considered evidence. Evidence means the name of a 
hospital, a date, the name and surname of the patient, date of 
birth, symptoms, a medical examination, therapy, and the seal 
and signature of the physician in charge. Unfortunately, there 
is plenty of such evidence published. We have not received a 
denial of a single one either from the Muslims, whom we were 
accusing, or from the UN Protection Force. [passage omitted] 
  Piskor: Grenades filled with chemical agents are 
being manufactured in Tuzla. However, is Tuzla dangerous just 
because of this? 
  Binenfeld: Precisely. The Sodaso factory in Tuzla 
is a real ecological bomb. I studied the Sodaso factory in 
autumn 1992. Bearing in mind that I obtained information about 
the exact quantities of chemicals that they possess from the 
factory itself, I informed all the important officials in the 
world about the danger. They have all acknowledged it but nobody 
has done a thing about it. I have informed the world that the 
approximately 60 tonnes of mercury in Tuzla presents a danger of 
contamination spreading via the Spreca River practically all the 
way to the Black Sea. The representative of Tuzla in Zagreb has 
openly threatened to do this. Bearing in mind that, apart from 
mercury, they have more than 150 tonnes of a chemical similar to 
the one in Bhopal, where a tenth of the quantity caused a huge 
ecological catastrophe and killed several thousands of people, 
it becomes clear why I have said that Sodaso is a real barrel of 
gunpowder. There is also a great quantity of hydrochloric acid 
and other acids. If an explosion occurred, lethal 
concentrations of acids would emerge. It is actually difficult 
to anticipate what would happen, how many people would perish, 
how many would be injured, and what the environment would be 
like afterward. It would be a catastrophe. I have proposed that 
these chemicals be transported somewhere safe, but, naturally, 
again without any success. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The residual fuel from the Kozloduy Nuclear Power 
Plant can be processed in Russia if we form a joint enterprise, 
Power Engineering Committee chief Nikita Shervashidze announced. 
  ``We will propose this to the Russians at the next talks,'' 
he explained. Bulgaria can carry out construction work in 
Russia, in return for which they could accept our waste nuclear 
fuel at a more acceptable price. 
  The Russians refused to accept radioactive waste in 1988, 
since when we have been stockpiling it in a temporary store. 
According to our contract with the former USSR, they should 
take back the fuel free of charge as long as we have nuclear 
plants. They have agreed to accept the fuel at a price of 
$1,016 per kilogram, which will cost us $22 million per year. 
  An alternative is to store the waste fuel in special 
containers near Kozloduy. These containers would cost us $20 
million until the year 2000. 
  So far, the most acceptable offer that we have received for 
storing the waste in Bulgaria is $60 million, which was offered 
by the U.S.-French consortium Framatom-Nuclear Pacific.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 Jan (EFE) -- Concern over 
conditions of human life and the consumption of earth resources 
were the main subject in the conclusions of the 19th General 
Assembly of the World Conservation Union [Union Internacional 
para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza -- UICN], which closed 
after 10 days of debate in Buenos Aires. 
  There was more interest in the sustained development of the 
planet, that is for the conditions in which human life develops 
and for the rational consumption of the earth resources, than in 
the effort to preserve animal species and ecologic systems. 
  This attitude caused discomfort among some non-government 
organizations which fear that the UICN may become a bureaucratic 
entity similar to other international forums in its efforts to 
establish a dialogue with industry and commerce. 
  The UICN considers the growing membership of indigenous, 
agricultural, and cattle farmer groups favors strong action in 
favor of the preservation of traditional resources and 
development, which should be gauged according to the capability 
of each region. 
  Experts say the industrialization process of developed 
countries should not be repeated, given that they have 
devastated most of their territories. Experts instead favor a 
development method that will protect the resources of each area 
and take advantage of the traditional knowledge of local 
inhabitants. 
  Experts from the five continents nonetheless greeted the 
unity shown by some national delegations in face of their need 
to present their proposals before the UICN as well as the 
capacity to unite like some regional blocs have done to 
strengthen their position. 
  The resolutions were presented by government and 
non-government members of the UICN. Of the 159 proposals, about 
50 were withdrawn or dismissed. 
  The Spanish delegation managed to get its proposal to 
establish the Mediterranean Regional Office headquarters in 
Spain accepted. The coordination of activities in the 
Mediterranean basin will thus be managed from the Iberian 
peninsula. 
  The UICN groups together 600 Non-Governmental Organizations 
(NGO), 100 governmental agencies, and 67 member states. For the 
voting power to be balanced, NGO's and states are granted one 
vote while agencies (on condition they do not represent a member 
state) are given two votes. 
  Experts were of one mind about the importance of UICN 
meetings in providing useful dialogue between governmental and 
nongovernmental groups, since every motion before the assembly 
must be passed by consensus following a debate. 
  The influence of the UICN over governments has enabled some 
NGO's to successfully request UICN help to urge their countries' 
authorities to abide by ecological regulations accepted by the 
international community. 
  The European group, however, was somewhat reluctant to 
discuss governmental issues that are deemed to fall under the 
jurisdiction of the European Union (UE), like questions 
pertaining to the GATT. 
  Biodiversity, the exportation of toxic waste, and 
environmental education were among the subjects mooted at the 
general assembly as well as internal issues, UICN actions before 
some governments, sustainable development, the conservation of 
different species, and the management of natural resources. 
  No agreement was reached on a resolution that sought to 
regulate UICN's action over the World Bank and other 
international financial organizations due to the amendments 
introduced by a group of NGO's. 
  Following a heated debate on the law on the hunt of large 
cetacea, two resolutions highlighting the ban on whaling were 
passed. 
  The minutes and resolutions of the 19th UICN General 
Assembly 
will soon be published and distributed among its members.

<F P=106> [Article by Delfin Arias Vargas: ``Environmental Battalion: </F>
First Step of `New' Armed Forces''] 
  [Text] On 20 December, once the final administrative and 
technical details of its mission are cleared up, the Army 
Environmental Battalion will be moved into the Ulla Ulla region. 
The Armed Forces will thus have taken the first and most 
fundamental step toward fulfilling their role in the country's 
new social and political reality. 
  After several months of study and evaluation of the 
functions 
to be performed by the Ulla Ulla headquarters, its installations 
will be inaugurated by the highest government and army 
officials. Other units similar to this battalion will 
subsequently be set up in other regions of the country, 
according to official Defense Ministry sources. 
  ``We are hopeful and that the service facilities required by 
this Ulla Ulla unit will be completed by 20 December, and are 
deeply gratified that this will enable the unit to begin its 
activities immediately,'' said Army commander in chief, General 
Reynaldo Caceres, in an upbeat tone, when asked about the matter. 
  The Ulla Ulla National Park Preserve contains within its 
territory, mainly, animals of endangered species, such as the 
vicuna, guanaco, and alpaca. These ``auquenidos'' [animals of 
genus Auchenia (synonym: Lama)] are hunted by 
poachers because of the high quality and commercial value of 
their wool. 
  This concern, and the need to make advantageous use of the 
military infrastructure and training, make the Armed Forces the 
appropriate institution to undertake the support of the 
country's integral development, as well as its defenses, and 
thus accomplish fully the Armed Forces' constitutional mission 
of safeguarding the nation's sovereignty and its natural 
resources, in accordance with guidelines laid down by the 
defense minister, Antonio Cespedes. 
  General Moises Shriqui, chief of staff of the Armed Forces, 
indicated recently that the funds the state earmarks for the 
Armed Forces will have to be reallocated to meet their highest 
priority needs, so that ``the institution does not neglect its 
constitutional mission of preserving the country's sovereignty 
and fulfills its responsibilities in support of the country's 
development.'' 
<H5>  Future Projects </H5>
  According to Defense Ministry sources, four social welfare 
projects similar to the Ulla Ulla project, to aid the 
inhabitants of the country's rural regions, and to be carried 
out by the Army, will be submitted to the Armed Forces high 
command for consideration in the coming weeks. 
  The announcement has the backing of the Army's commanding 
general, who stated that ``under our current plans, the 
environmental defense units are to be implemented gradually 
during the coming fiscal year, in accordance with the 
requirements and the missions the government may be assigning to 
us.'' 
  In keeping with this position, the Ulla Ulla headquarters is 
being established as the first military unit to assume 
responsibility for the defense of the environment, particularly 
in border regions, where, in the absence of control by the 
state, natural resources are being irrationally exploited by 
citizens of foreign countries and by Bolivians. 
<H5>  Plan for Camelidos </H5>
  In keeping with the military's new role as announced by the 
defense minister, a plan covering the breeding of ``camelidos'' 
[animals of the family Camelidae, which includes 
those of aforementioned genus Auchenia], and their 
commercial exploitation, was submitted, toward the end of last 
week, to officials of COFADENA [Armed Forces National 
Development Corporation]. This plan guarantees a rise in the 
altiplano farmers' incomes. 
  This project, like the others, will be supported by the 
participation of Army officers in a training capacity, and of 
Army draftees doing their military service. 
<H5>  Not Only Plan for Camelidos </H5>
  Sources consulted indicated that the military's new role 
will 
open the way in the valley regions for a project aimed at making 
use of hillsides to plant forage trees, which besides 
reforesting the area will supply firewood for the neighboring 
communities. 
  In the Chaco area, implementation of a plan is being 
advanced, again with military participation, calling for 
ecological management of the region, and the exploitation of its 
natural conditions of high temperature and dry climate during 
most of the year. 
  As explained by the experts whose opinion was sought and who 
work for the Defense Ministry, the planting of ``leuquena'' 
[lead tree, Leucaena glauca], a forage tree par 
excellence, which was also planted on the Abapo Izozog plains, 
although that agricultural development project was not 
completed, virtually guarantees positive results in the raising 
of goats and the production of milk. 
  Another project that will be considered by the Armed Forces 
concerns the preservation of the Moxos cattle country, in the 
Beni district, where more than 5 million hectares of cattle 
grazing land would benefit. It would include the application of 
techniques for sheltering cattle during periods of rain and the 
ensuing flooding. 
  Officials point out that, beginning in 1994, the 
above-mentioned assignments will impart to the Armed Forces the 
leading role in the nation's development.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Coca Plantations and Environmental </F>
Degradation''] 
  [Text] Between 1987 and 1991 more than 17,000 hectares of 
coca plantations were declared to have been eradicated in the 
Chapare under the Alternative Crop Planting Programs, and, until 
the end of the previous administration, it was maintained that 
the eradication program and the DESAL's [Center for Latin 
American Socioeconomic Development] operations had been a 
success. 
  Now, it is reported that satellite photographs show 47,000 
hectares under coca cultivation, hence an actual increase. The 
United States Embassy has set a 1994 deadline for completion of 
the eradication, since it has been found that only 10 percent of 
the production has a legitimate use, and that the rest is used 
for the manufacture of cocaine base. 
  The foregoing indicates the scantiness of the information 
filtering down to the public on the subject of coca cultivation. 
Since the topic is intertwined with police and diplomatic 
issues, the information being released is incomplete; and it 
still cannot be said that there is a strong current of public 
opinion in favor of replacing the coca economy. 
  The fact that has been given the least importance is that 
the 
Chapare is an ecosystem of approximately 2.5 million hectares 
that is in the process of being destroyed by coca cultivation 
and the use of chemical precursors. 
  Coca is necessary for soil preservation in the Yungas of La 
Paz, according to reports by LIDEMA [League for the Protection 
of the Environment]. But in the Chapare, farming techniques, 
lack of crop rotation, and weeding with the grubbing hoe, have 
all accelerated erosion and done away with the thin layer of 
topsoil. 
  In 1991, the degradation of the soil that was found to have 
occurred in the eradicated areas of the Chapare was such as to 
require a waiting period estimated at 10 to 15 years for its 
recovery. 
  But the problem is not only coca itself. According to data 
released to the press in 1991, the drug producers have, each 
year, been spraying between 121,000 and 127,000 tons of leaves 
with 278 tons of sulfuric acid and approximately 12 million 
liters of gasoline, kerosene, and jet fuel. Since coca 
cultivation has now expanded, it must be assumed that these 
figures have also grown. Even though not the entire measure of 
contaminants reaches the Chapare's soil or its rivers, it is 
known that lime and sulfuric acid drastically modify the pH of 
soils and waters. And the kerosene, spreading out into rivers, 
seriously contaminates the waters. Antidrug police forces have 
destroyed tens of thousands of vats and laboratories in the area. 
  The coca plant is not the only link in the chain, and, 
within 
the ambit of shared international responsibility for curtailing 
the drug traffic, the positions being taken against its 
cultivation are increasingly aggressive. This is not the case, 
however, with respect to the traffic of the chemical 
contaminants. Without coca there is no drug, but neither is 
there drug without precursors. In Bolivia alone there are four 
legally established enterprises for the manufacture of sulfuric 
acid, hydrochloric acid, and ammonia, although the industrial 
demand for these products is insignificant. 
  It seems that nations that manufacture chemicals have not 
shouldered the responsibility devolving upon them to control the 
trafficking in these products. Records show that precursors are 
arriving from Germany, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, United States, 
Holland, Peru, Switzerland, Italy, England, France, and others. 
Legally or illegally imported, they are entering through Chilean 
ports. 
  Furthermore, all production increases when demand requires 
it. And while the Alternative Crop Planting Program has been a 
failure, the campaigns to curb the dealing and use of drugs in 
consumer countries have also been a failure.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Studies Confirm River Basin </F>
Problems''] 
  [Text] For those who do not understand or do not want to 
understand the need to develop a policy of river basin 
management, there are recent studies, carried out by CIMAR 
(Center for Research and Management of Renewable Natural 
Resources; UAGRM [expansion not given]), that provide eloquent 
data on the rivers of the Sara e Ichilo province. 
  The Pirai problem area concerns national property. Reference 
must therefore be made to other basins that are also in a 
threatening situation that is the result of meddling by the hand 
of man. 
<H5>  Rio Yapacani Basin </H5>
  Originating at the Cienaga River, the Yapacani River basin 
has a steep downgrade, from 2,400 meters above sea level to 
1,500 meters above sea level, within the first 56 kilometers of 
its descent. This contributes to the natural excavation of the 
riverbed and the carrying down of sediments by the river, as 
well as the erosion of the surrounding hillsides by farming and 
overgrazing. At the tableland there is good undergrowth, which 
leads to the assumption that the input of sediment to that point 
is low. 
  This confirms that the enormous volumes of sediment arriving 
at the lowland, silting up the riverbed, and forcing its 
permanent divergence have their origin in the mesothermal 
valleys. 
  The consequences are serious problems to roads, bridges, and 
other infrastructure in the lowland. 
<H5>  Rio Surutu Subbasin </H5>
  The studies made under the SENMA-BID [expansion not given] 
project, bear out the conclusion that due to the steep downgrade 
of its subbasin and main riverbed, the Surutu River presents 
torrential characteristics and flash currents that create a high 
risk of flashfloods, and has a substantial capacity for natural 
excavation of the riverbed, and for carrying down sediments 
(gravel and sand) that are deposited beginning at the Huaytu 
area where its banks lack vegetal cover. This renders the basin 
``very frail,'' with results that are being seen around the 
mouth of the Yapacani River--where some years ago the main 
channel was two kilometers away from the bridge and where it is 
now threatening to break up the access road to the bridge--and 
at Huaytu where the ongoing natural excavation is threatening 
the rural farmlands. 
<H5>  Rio Palometilla Subbasin </H5>
  The main problem presented by this river is the high volume 
of sediments (soil and embankment) it carries down from its 
headwaters and the hillsides, owing to the farmers' clearing of 
trees and shrubs from the terrain. The original level of the 
riverbed has been raised, causing damming and flooding of 
considerable magnitude in the ``El Torrente'' sector, with 
destruction of the Montero-Yapacani road creating traffic 
problems, and the inundating of certain farming and 
cattle-raising sectors downstream in quasi-permanent form, with 
consequent losses. 
<H5>  Rio Ichilo Basin </H5>
  According to SENMA-BID researchers, this river and its 
tributaries carry sediments in suspension in considerable 
quantities, resulting from farming at the foot of the mountain 
and in the lower sector of the basin. 
<H5>  Rio Palacio Subbasin </H5>
  The damming and flooding of the Antofagasta area is 
attributable to the following causes: 
  1) Farming activities (clearing of land and trails) have 
blocked natural drainage; 
  2) When the YPFB [Bolivian Government Oil Deposits] built 
its 
seismological stations, it left embankments that actually are 
submerged dams; when the ENFE [National Railway Enterprise] 
built the railway, in 1970, crossing the area's natural drainage 
lines it caused the obstruction of the riverbed by aquatic and 
shrub-like vegetation. 
  This is a simplified summary of a wide-ranging study that 
has 
been made on the problems in the river basins, that are 
adversely affecting the farming and livestock industry, the 
transportation industry, and road infrastructure, in addition to 
damaging the environment. 
  It is recognized that substantial programs to remedy this 
situation have not been developed, but targeted efforts have 
been deployed, such as the drainage system project in San Juan 
de Yapacani (JICA [Japanese International Cooperation Agency]); 
the study and design of the drainage system in the colonia 
Antofagasta (FAO/CORDE-CRUZ [Food and Agriculture 
Organization/Santa Cruz Development Corporation]), which is to 
be financed by PRODEPA [expansion not given]; and the SEARPI 
[expansion not given] and Regional Drainage Study pilot projects 
by the CIAT [International Center for Tropical Agriculture].

sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program (PNUMA) and 
by the United Nations Commission for Trade and Development 
(UNCTAD), for 17 February in Geneva. 
  Environment and Legal Amazon Region Minister Rubens Ricupero 
was yesterday officially invited by Elizabeth Dedswell, PNUMA 
director, to preside over the Geneva meeting. The minister said 
it will be an opportunity to make an evaluation of the talks on 
the problem and on the progress made during the Uruguay Round of 
the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) talks, which 
were concluded on 15 December 1993. 
  In the opinion of Ricupero, the link between trade and 
environment and the so-called competition rules will be the two 
main topics of intenational economic discussions in the next few 
years. The Brazilian Government is getting ready to confront the 
various initiatives that are beginning to proliferate, like 
green stamps, special packaging standards, and European and U.S. 
laws aimed at preserving the environment and which affect 
Brazilian exports. 
<H5>  Interministerial Meeting </H5>
  An interministerial group headed by Winston Fritsch, the 
Finance Ministry secretary of economic policy, met at the 
ministry last week to discuss the problem of industrial policy 
from the viewpoint of Brazil's environmental commitments. Says 
Ricupero: ``We studied how the new industrial policy will have 
to adjust itself to rules such as the ISO 9000 standards, trying 
to prevent our competitiveness from being affected.'' 
  Ricupero will prepare a document outlining the Brazilian 
position. ``The Brazilian sectors with the heaviest weight 
among exports, like paper and cellulose, and iron and steel, are 
sensitive to the new requirements tied to environmental 
preservation,'' the minister said. ``We must give those sectors 
environmental standards in order to prevent them from becoming 
the victims of protectionist offensives,'' he said. 
<H5>  Coal </H5>
  The minister will go to Santa Catarina over the weekend to 
discuss the environmental impact of the coal industry. 
  According to Ricupero, in his ministry there exists the 
Pro-Vida program to help the industries of the sector recuperate 
deteriorated areas. 
  Within GATT there is a work group studying trade and its 
relationship with the environment. The group was created in 
1971. 
  The group met again only in 1991, and so far has held four 
or 
five meetings to address matters like the European Union's green 
stamp and labelling and packaging standards. ``This group will 
receive additional impulse'' in the the next few years, Ricupero 
said, because of the importance of the subject.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 29 January (DPA) -- Presidential 
Narino Palace sources reported today the Colombian Government 
had initiated the new Environment Ministry, which will watch 
over and protect the country's natural resources from now on. 
  President Cesar Gaviria has appointed Manuel Rodriguez as 
this agency's first minister. Rodriguez was director of the 
government's Institute for the Development of Renewable Natural 
Resources (Inderena), an organization that will be liquidated 
shortly. 
  The Congress of the Republic approved the creation of the 
Environment Ministry last year. The guidelines, planning, and 
implementation of this ministry will be financed by a special 
transfer of resources, Rodriguez stated when he accepted the 
position. 
  Colombia is a country rich in natural resources, but those 
resources have suffered a serious erosion during the past years 
due to the high levels of contamination and deforestation to 
allow for the emergence of ``concrete jungles.'' 
  The government has announced, however, that it will launch a 
strong environmental protection policy, which the new agency 
will coordinated.

<F P=106> [Article by Silvia Coello Q.: ``Mangrove Swamps </F>
Disappearing''] 
  [Text] Since 1987, at the start of the shrimp boom in 
Esmeraldas Province, the mangrove swamps have begun 
disappearing, to be replaced by shrimp-breeding pools. One of 
the areas hardest hit has been Muisne which, after having had 
3,500 hectares of mangrove swamps, is left with only 20 percent 
of that total. People from the island have made serious charges 
of illegal tree felling and fraudulent concessions to 
shrimp-breeding establishments. The mangrove swamp is 
disappearing, and nearly 2,000 users, such as scallop and crab 
fishermen and charcoal makers, are being hurt directly. 
  During the canoe trip that we took last week through the 
Muisne area, Nisbaldo Ortiz never stopped raising his hand to 
point to the sites where shrimp pools have supplanted what had 
previously been a mangrove swamp. We were accompanied by members 
of ecological groups, some settlers, and authorities from the 
Ecuadoran Natural Areas and Wildlife Forest Institute (INEFAN). 
  Nisbaldo is a young native of Muisne who has become the 
leader of the community's own mangrove swamp defense movement. 
Tired of complaining and appealing to the authorities to stop 
the illegal felling of mangrove trees, the community residents 
decided to create the Ecological Defense Foundation. It has its 
own surveillance committee to make constant checks of the area, 
so as to catch those felling the trees and attempt to stop them. 
  Despite the surveillance goals and action, what the 
community 
has been able to accomplish is very little or nothing. This is 
readily discernible, because shrimp-breeding establishments show 
up everywhere in this area. Some appear camouflaged. Anyone 
travelling along the Muisne River and viewing its shores, 
apparently filled with mangrove trees, would have every reason 
to think that the mangrove swamps are intact. However, one need 
only enter them a short distance to find the large 
shrimp-breeding pools. 
  The Muisne residents estimate that there must be about 250 
shrimp-breeding establishments in the area, some small and 
others covering many hectares. Added to this are the large 
expanses of now infertile mangrove land, which was once used for 
shrimp breeding and never reforested. 
  The original size of the local mangrove swamp on Muisne 
Island was 3,500 hectares, and now the largest remaining areas, 
between the localities of Bunche and Mompiche, measure 716 
hectares. In other words, approximately 80 percent of the 
mangrove swamps have been destroyed. 
  The tree felling boom began in 1987, upon completion of the 
paved road leading to Nuevo Muisne, situated opposite the 
island. With the start of the indiscriminate tree cutting, the 
shrimp boom also began in the area. Besides the threat to nature 
entailed by the disappearance of the mangrove swamp, large 
groups of humans, such as scallop, crab, and other fishermen, 
larvae collectors, and charcoal makers, are being hurt by the 
shortage of products and the deterioration in their way of life. 
Seven communities and six districts, located between Bunche and 
San Gregorio, in Muisne Canton, with approximately 1,680 
inhabitants, have been forced to seek their catch far from the 
area, or to change their mode of living. 
  Simon Vega, aged 30, claims to have been catching scallops 
and crab in the mangrove swamp all his life. 
  Now, he also has a tricycle of the type used on the island 
to 
carry tourists to the beach, ``because if I did not have another 
job I could not support my family. In the past, I used to catch 
from 300 to 400 scallops in two or three hours. Now, working 
almost all day, I can barely collect 40 or 50, and I earn only 
4,000 sucres from that.'' 
  However, the problem is not merely a financial one. Simon 
adds that anyone entering the mangrove swamp does so risking his 
life. ``They do not even let us approach the shrimp breeders' 
shores. If you go in too far, they shoot you. One day they shot 
and wounded my mother, who is 60 years old and also fishes for 
scallops.'' 
  Lourdes Proano, secretary of the canton's Civic Board, who 
is 
also fighting to defend the mangrove swamp, claims that the 
situation has worsened, particularly for poor families and 
women, most of whom are engaged in scallop fishing. ``While they 
are destroying the livelihood of the people here, the shrimp 
breeders have not generated sources of employment for the 
residents, because most of the people they hire are from other 
places.'' 
<H5>  Charges </H5>
  The Muisne mangrove swamps were one of the best reserves in 
the country. The largest one now is the reserve located in the 
northern part of Esmeraldas, between Limones and San Lorenzo, 
with approximately 40,000 hectares. However, 15 percent has been 
devastated by the shrimp breeders' intervention. In 1986, the 
mangrove swamps were declared protective woods by law; hence, 
felling them is illegal. So, what is the explanation for the 
shrimp-breeding establishments' presence in the mangrove swamps? 
  The members of Muisne's Ecological Defense Foundation show 
us 
a considerable number of charges that they have brought to the 
local and national authorities, who have not adopted any 
measures to deal with them. The Muisne residents admit that they 
are not optimistic about the type of action taken by the 
authorities. They inspect at a given time, halting the work that 
is being done on the shrimp pools. ``On those occasions, they 
stop everything, but the work is continued afterward, because 
the financial pressures are much stronger,'' remarks Lourdes 
Proano. 
  Nisbaldo Ortiz adds: ``On the other hand, a genuine black 
market for the sale of mangrove woods has become legitimized. 
Through it, the businessmen learn that they must first cut or 
destroy the mangrove swamps, and then request the concession. 
The local authorities' action has been very slight, and they act 
only when pressured.'' 
  Since 1989, the foundation has reported 37 cases of mangrove 
felling, only four of which have been handled properly. A report 
from that institution states: ``Nearly all the violators were 
reported on time, when they had just begun cutting or sawing 
mangrove thickets. Yet the vast majority managed to complete 
their shrimp pools, because the competent authorities failed to 
do their duty by stopping them permanently, confiscating tools, 
punishing the guilty ones, and forcing them to repair the damage 
they had caused. On the contrary, the collusion of bureaucrats 
on all levels in failing to take action is obvious.'' 
  The charges in each case are detailed. They note, 
chronologically, how the cutting occurred; and, insofar as land 
ownership certificates are concerned, they indicate that the 
majority of shrimp-breeding establishments have fraudulent 
ministerial decrees. 
  They also charge that, in both the Muisne area and northern 
Esmeraldas, the IERAC [Ecuadoran Institute of Agrarian Reform 
and Settlement], in a clear violation of the Forest and Wildlife 
Law, is granting permits and concessions to private individuals 
in extensive mangrove swamp areas. 
<H5>  Lack of Institutional Coordination </H5>
  Institutions such as the Merchant Marine, the 
Undersecretariat of Fisheries, the Coastal Resources Management 
Program, and the INEFAN are supposed to oversee the proper 
operation of shrimp-breeding establishments. Luis Valverde, 
national forest director, declares: ``There is, however, no 
order; rather, they just come and cut trees. The Merchant Marine 
is the one responsible for beaches and bays; it should come and 
put them in jail. But, in fact, this does not occur. Almost none 
of the certificates issued for forming shrimp-breeding 
establishments have been authorized by the Ministry of 
Agriculture through the INEFAN, at least so long as I have held 
this position.'' 
  So, what is the explanation for the shrimp breeding 
establishments' unauthorized presence? ``Because there is big 
capital here; this is achieved with banknotes here.'' 
  ``Furthermore, the INEFAN is responsible only for the trees. 
So, when they are already cut, we have to apply the law stating 
that the fine is from one to 10 minimum living wages. The forest 
law does not call for criminal type action. So, I think that the 
only way to stop the felling is to heighten the awareness of the 
citizens. Shrimp exports are the third-ranking item in the 
nation's economy; and so, these are very powerful people. It is 
not that we oppose the shrimp breeders' establishments or the 
nation's progress. They could be started, but in the upper part 
of the mangrove swamp, not in the swamp itself.'' This is 
Valverde's response. 
  By law, it is determined that the Merchant Marine has 
control 
over the beach and bay areas, and that the INEFAN can take 
action only in areas declared protective woods. Thus, in one way 
or another, the control of the mangrove swamps depends on these 
two institutions. Moreover, the Constitution of the Republic 
specifies that no institution may become involved in another's 
activities. With this situation, Jorge Barba, director of the 
INEFAN, claims that the advantage of the institute headed by him 
is that the INEFAN law stipulates that it must concern itself 
with all the marginal land not being used for agriculture or 
livestock raising, such as the mangrove swamps. ``This has 
enabled us to accomplish some work; and, for cases such as 
these, the Commission for Environmental Affairs has been 
created.'' 
  Barba adds that, since the INEFAN has just been created, 
plans and maps are yet to be made for this area, so as to study 
the problems in detail. ``We are just now meeting with 
representatives of the World Bank, and we shall request $60 
million for the renewable resources sector. We also intend to 
meet with the owners of the shrimp breeding establishments, so 
that, instead of being enemies, we can work together.'' 
  The National Campaign for Defense of the Mangrove Swamps and 
the South American Mangrove System charged that the national 
forest director, through an official memorandum dated 31 August 
of this year, set a price per pilot and per hectare of mangrove 
trees, thereby legitimizing their destruction. 
  When Barba was asked about this, he commented: ``We must 
give 
the mangrove tree a value, in any case, whether it is cut with 
or without a permit: we have to collect. It is not a sin to cut 
a mangrove tree; the sin lies in its being cut without many more 
being planted. So, the problem is not in setting a value for it, 
but rather in undervaluing it.'' 
<H5>  Use Without Destruction </H5>
  Good management of resources seeks a break-even point that 
will enable people today to meet their needs without denying 
opportunity to future generations. The mangrove swamp has done 
the country much good; but it cannot stand there untouched, 
either. It must be used, but without being destroyed. This 
statement was made by Washington Macias, director of the Pedro 
Vicente Maldonado Foundation which, together with the Coastal 
Resources Management Program (PMRC), has a management plan for 
the Muisne area, among others in the country. Macias adds that 
the break-even point in a mangrove swamp is reached when more 
than 75 percent of its trees are felled. 
  The Pedro Vicente Maldonado Foundation, jointly with the 
PMRC, is working on the process of mangrove tree regeneration. 
As Macias indicates, this means that some mangrove tree users 
could make use of part of their hectares alternately. For 
example, if they use 20 for making charcoal, immediately 
harvesting it, and do the same thing, consecutively, with the 
other hectares, when they reach 200 hectares the first 320 would 
already have been regenerated. He remarks: ``We must see to it 
that the communities have direct access to the mangrove swamp 
for activities that are not devastating, but, rather, 
productive, such as tourism.'' 
  ``In Venezuela, for example, in all their soap operas they 
show the Margarita mangrove swamps: which are rather 
insignificant from a scenic standpoint when compared with the 
mangrove swamps extending from Puerto Bolivar to Jambeli.'' This 
claim is made by Macias, who adds that, ``if concessions have 
been made to shrimp breeding establishments in mangrove areas, 
it is because the law itself is inadequate. Hence, there must be 
a heightened awareness among the shrimp breeders.'' 
  For the present, the Muisne residents have begun 
establishing 
a new strategy for themselves: speaking directly to the shrimp 
breeders. ``We think that they sometimes cut down mangrove trees 
without realizing what they could be causing. We want to enter 
into a joint system with them to save our mangrove swamps.'' 
  Nevertheless, they will demand, officially, that the State 
Comptroller General's Office form a committee to audit the 
management of the public institutions that have granted 
concessions to shrimp breeders since the date when the country's 
mangrove swamps were declared protective woods. 
<H5>  [Box, p 12] </H5>
<H5>  Particular Features of the Ecosystem </H5>
  The mangrove swamp is the perfect habitat for scallops, 
crabs, and crayfish, because it produces the detritus that is 
the food for these species. It is produced when the mangrove 
tree dumps tons of dead foliage into the water. The mangrove 
swamp is a natural element to protect against downpours and to 
prevent flooding in nearby towns and land. It prevents the winds 
blowing from the sea inland from salinizing agricultural land. 
  Generally, since mangrove trees do not have one large root, 
but rather are entangled with one another, when they are cut, 
even though it be only one tree, there is a danger that the 
others will fall. 
  The tree produces pilots, and the bark on the branches is 
useful for making a tanning substance. Other major users of the 
mangrove swamp are the charcoal makers.

  [Text] Quito, 24 Jan (EFE) -- Representatives of Ecuador's 
indigenous people today threatened to seize oil wells in the 
nation's Amazon region if the government proceeds with the 
seventh round of bids -- a bidding process for which the 
indigenous people have requested a 15-year moratorium. 
  Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of Indigenous 
Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), said the indigenous people 
are willing to take up the last resort, adding that the 
indigenous people and others residing in the Amazon region could 
even seize the wells ``to prevent additional ecological 
disaster.'' 
  The Ecuadoran Government today opened the seventh round of 
petroleum bids for the exploration and exploitation of 3.2 
million hectares in the Ecuadoran Amazon region and offshore 
areas. The indigenous people's representative said the 
petroleum companies have caused irreparable damage to the 
environment and to the life of the inhabitants of the Ecuadoran 
Amazon region. 
  Macas said, ``The Ecuadoran Government is putting the only 
green area left in the Amazon region up for bid, and this is the 
reason why we have requested a 15-year moratorium on the 
bidding.'' 
  The indigenous leader added that the exploitation of 
petroleum has been carried out in an irrational manner and 
without consulting the people who are most affected -- namely, 
the indigenous people and residents of the Ecuadoran Amazon 
region. The Conaie president noted that the indigenous people 
have filed a suit with the Human Rights Commission of the OAS, 
and he added that the international organization is waiting for 
the government to send the commission an invitation to inspect 
the oil drilling areas. 
  Ecuador's environmental and indigenous people's 
organizations 
this morning took over the Energy and Mines Ministry to pressure 
the government not to carry out the bidding. They also 
requested a meeting with President Sixto Duran-Ballen.

external harnessing of shared international water resources. 
Briefing the heads of foreign missions in Dhaka yesterday, he 
said the serious environmental problems being faced by 
Bangladesh call for urgent international attention. Some of 
these problems are within the capacity of Bangladesh to solve, 
but much of them are caused by external harnessing of shared 
international water resources. He suggested that by visiting 
the areas in April and May, the envoys could themselves see the 
impact on the environment of Bangladesh by these external 
harnessing of waters.

  [Text] Bombay, 26 Nov--The draconian anti-pollution law 
recently imposed by the U.S. on ships trading with that country 
is not fully justified as ship-source pollution only amounts to 
10 percent of the total marine pollution, Mr. P.K. Srivastava, 
director (bulk carriers and tankers), Shipping Corporation of 
India, told a seminar here on Wednesday. 
  It was revealed at the seminar, organised by Steamship 
Mutual 
Underwriting Association (Bermuda), a leading P&amp;I (protection 
and indemnity) Club, and Crowe Boda and Co, its Indian 
correspondents, that the U.S. has rejected the international 
conventions and their protocols and had its own pollution 
legislation--the Oil Pollution Act. 
  Referring to the U.S. legislation, Mr. Srivastava said such 
laws, if they are not reality-based, would act as disincentive. 
As the issue had become highly emotive, all protests about the 
perceived imbalance between the degree of the ship-generated 
pollution and the draconian nature of the law were proving to be 
a cry in the wilderness. 
  There has also been concern that the ready availability of 
ever-increasing compensation funds for marine pollution tends to 
instil a sense of complacency within the operational sector of 
the shipping industry, according to him. 
  The P&amp;I Clubs had a role in mitigating the problem as 
pollution related claims, not only accounted for a sizeable part 
of the total P&amp;I claims but also because the wide publicity 
that 
is being given to the incidents of pollution affected the 
professional image of the shipping industry, he said. 
  The clubs cover claims against their members for loss damage 
and expense arising from pollution caused by an escape or 
discharge of oil from their vessels including fines, up to a 
limit, at present, of $500 million per accident or occurrence. 
  Dr. I.C. White, managing director of the International 
Tanker 
Owners' Pollution Federation, the UK, gave details about the 
federation's computerised oil spill response database and said 
it also provided practical information on oil spill response 
techniques. 
  He said the incidence of oil spills greater than 5,000 
barrels (about 700 tonnes) from vessels had come down from an 
average a year in the 1970's to nine in 1980's, spills of the 
size resulting from recent accidents involving the Nagasaki 
Spirit, Aegean Sea, Braer and Maersk Navigator being exceptional. 
  The ``entry into force'' provisions of the conventions and 
their protocols have, therefore, been amended so that they will 
take effect without the U.S. support. One of them is the 
International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution 
Damage 1969 (CLC) and the other International Convention on the 
establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil 
Pollution Damage 1971 (the Fund Convention), established to 
provide additional compensation in cases where the damage claims 
exceeded the shipowners' liability under the CLC or where the 
case fell within one of the exceptions of defences under the CLC. 
  CLC is funded by the tanker owners through their insurers, 
where the Fund Convention is funded by contributions levied on 
crude and fuel oil cargo receivers who get more than 15,000 
million tonnes of oil by sea in any one year. 
  The main amendments to them adopted by the protocols have 
increased the limits of liability under CLC and Fund Convention, 
taken into account not only actual pollution but also pure 
threat situations, extended the geographical scope of the 
conventions and amended the definition of pollution. 
  The CLC is now applied in 79 countries, excluding the U.S., 
and 56 of them have adopted the Fund convention. The protocols 
have yet to come into force. 
  Anticipating delays in the ratification of international 
conventions, the tanker and oil industries established voluntary 
agreements such as Tanker Owners' Voluntary Agreement Concerning 
Liability for Oil Pollution (TOVALOP), supported by P&amp;I 
clubs, 
who are insurers of the tanker industry, and Contract Regarding 
a Supplement to Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution (CRISTAL), an 
agreement between oil companies anticipating the coming into 
force of the Fund Convention. 
  Limits of liability which apply under CLC and the Fund are 
exceeded by the limits under the voluntary schemes as the 
voluntary schemes have moved ahead of the international 
conventions.

  [Text] Bandar Anzali, Gilan Prov., Jan 20, IRNA -- The 
Fisheries Organization of Iran signed protocols with Russian

Iran's coastal waters of the Caspian Sea. 
  The protocols were inked at the end of a five-day session of 
fishery experts of Iran and Russia at Mirza Kuchak-Khan 
Institute of Rasht, near here. 
  Director of the Research Center of Iranian Fisheries in 
Gilan 
Province Sha'ban-'Ali Nezami told IRNA here that three 
agreements had been entered into with the Russian officials 
which aimed to determine hydrological and hydro-biological 
resources of the southern waters of the Caspian off the Iranian 
coast. 
  He said a number of Russian experts would also offer their 
expertise to their Iranian counterparts in the area of research 
on strugeon fish. In addition, he said, it was agreed that a 
group of Iranian fisheries experts would visit Russia next year 
for studies in this field. 
  The fisheries officials of the two countries have also 
agreed

  [Text] Jordan denied that it had agreed with Israel on 
measures to control marine pollution in the Gulf of Aqaba. The 
head of Jordan's delegation to the environmental multilateral 
talks, Dr. Anis al-Mu'ashshir, said no such agreement was 
reached with Israel. He told ``News at Ten'' that there had been 
a decision by the environment multilateral meeting to establish 
three units in al- 'Aqabah, Elat, and Nuwaybi'. 
  Dr. al-Mu'ashshir said the units will be established with 
the 
help of the European Union, and will combat oil spills and 
pollution as well as deal with emergency situations in the Gulf 
of Aqaba. 
  He said the Europeans will discuss the implementation of the 
decision with Jordan, Israel, and Egypt, but stressed that this 
was in no way an agreement with Israel.

  [Text] A national forest conservation plan is now being 
implemented. It provides for systematic forest management and 
reforestation. Strict penalties are to be imposed for the 
destruction of forest. In addition, the master plan for 
forestry is to be revived. 
  Sri Lanka has lost over 400,000 hectares of its forest cover 
during the last decade. The rapid deforestation has been blamed 
on the growing population and other issues. Only 20.3 percent 
of Sri Lanka's land area is under forest. The forest cover 
stood at 70 percent at the turn of this century. The declined 
forest cover has caused natural disasters such as floods, soil 
erosion, and landslide.
