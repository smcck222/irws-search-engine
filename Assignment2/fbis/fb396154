  [Text] Nukus Jan 11 TASS -- Russia and five CIS Central 
Asian states agreed on Tuesday to set up a joint fund to save 
the inland Aral Sea which is drying out and can result in a 
major ecological catastrophe. 
  At a meeting in the Uzbek city of Nukus situated in the 
delta 
of Amu Darya River flowing into the Aral Sea leaders of 
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and 
a Russian deputy premier adopted a number of agreements which 
envisage the creation of the fund, a programme of improving the 
ecological situation in the Aral Sea zone, as well as provisions 
for an interstate council on the problems of the sea. The 
executive committee of the council was created. 
  Russia was represented by Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov. 
The meeting was also attended by UN envoy in Uzbekistan Hamid 
Malik.

<F P=106> [Report by Shakhabutdin Zaynutdinov: ``Presidents Resolve </F>
Aral's Problems''] 
  [Text] Nukus -- A representative conference devoted to 
comprehensive issues of the protection of the Aral Sea ended in 
Nukus with the signing of a statute on an interstate council on 
the problems of the Aral Sea basin and the approval of a 
long-term program for the region's socioeconomic development and 
the improvement of the ecological situation in the Aral region 
in the next few years. 
  Official delegations from the following took part in the 
work 
of the conference: Kazakhstan, headed by President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev; Kyrgyzstan, headed by President Askar Akayev; 
Tajikistan, headed by Emomali Rakhmonov, chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet; Turkmenistan, headed by President Saparmurad Niyazov; 
Uzbekistan, headed by President Islam Karimov; and the Russian 
Federation, headed by Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov. Representatives 
of international organizations also took part. 
  Opening the conference, the head of Uzbekistan noted that 
much has been done to supply the inhabitants of the Aral Sea 
region with drinking water and medical supplies. Fewer 
chemicals are now being used in agriculture. Thanks to the 
efforts of the leaders of the countries of the region the 
decline in the water level in the sea has been halted but the 
tragedy of the Aral Sea is affecting the health of people far 
beyond the sea basin. All this is directly connected with the 
uneconomic use of water resources and the shortage of money. To 
rectify the situation joint efforts are needed by all Central 
Asian states with the assistance of the international community. 
  This idea was supported by Kazakhstan President N. 
Nazarbayev, chairman of the international fund to save the Aral 
Sea, who informed those present that messages of support had 
been received from the leaders of the United States, France, 
Britain, Spain, Belgium, and Turkey. Khalid Malik, Uzbekistan's 
permanent UN representative, gave an assurance that 
international organizations are prepared to render every support 
in this common cause.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Bayduzhiy: ``Live Merchandise Leaving </F>
Russia. If Barriers Are Not Placed on Its Path, the Red Book 
Could Turn Into Many Volumes''] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Sore Spot </H5>
  It seems that among the largest items of Russian 
exports--petroleum, gas, and metals--in the near future it will 
also be necessary to include trade in living merchandise. No, so 
far things have not reached the point where Russia, like Africa 
in the 18th century, has turned into a supplier of human beings 
for the slave market. It is much simpler: As in other states of 
the former USSR, illegal purchase and sale of rare kinds of 
flora and fauna has been developing more and more actively here. 
  According to information from international experts, during 
1991 in Europe alone contraband trade turnover in unique species 
of animals and plants exceeded $1 billion. Two-thirds of its 
volume was in former USSR republics. Things have certainly not 
improved on the territory of one-sixth of the earth's surface, 
but as the boundaries of the collapsing Union become 
increasingly penetrable, they leave no doubt that the scale of 
this trade has increased even more. For example, not so long ago 
a scandal broke out in the West over press reports to the effect 
that certain Russian firms had offered to let wealthy foreigners 
entertain themselves by hunting the Ussuriysk tiger, which is in 
the Red Book. A number of international organizations have 
officially expressed their concern about the increased scale of 
uncontrolled hunting in Russia. 
  It is not even that killing animals is a bad thing in 
general, and rare ones in particular. As early as 1973 Russia 
along with 120 other countries signed in Washington a Convention 
on International Trade in Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 
Threatened by Extinction. According to this document, 
international trade in all representatives of the animal and 
vegetable kingdoms included in the international Red Book shall 
be prohibited. Moreover, each country has a list of local 
species of flora and fauna whose sale abroad, although 
permitted, must be clearly restricted and controlled with the 
help of licenses. Among the domestic animals on this list, 
otters, wolves, lynx, and, of course, the symbol of Russia, the 
brown bear, are especially popular among foreigners. During 1993 
the Main Administration of Biological Resources of the Ministry 
of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources issued 1,000 
permits to various organizations for exporting, re-exporting, 
and importing 30,000 ``objects of animal and vegetable origin.'' 
However, in the opinion of specialists, this is only the tip of 
the iceberg. In reality the scale of trade in living merchandise 
and its contraband turnover is at least 10 times greater. 
  Both individual unwitting citizens and completely 
respectable 
organizations engage in this business. Quite recently in Seattle 
(United States) they confiscated a batch of lynx hides shipped 
by the Irkutsk Fur-Hide Base without any license. Domestic and 
foreign environmental protection departments are becoming more 
and more concerned about cases of commercial hunting where 
animals that are not to be used for game shooting are being 
offered as future hunting trophies to people from distant 
foreign countries who wish them. It is extremely difficult to 
control this business: Workers in the majority of customs 
offices have no idea which species of animals are banned from 
shipment out of the country. But even if each crossover point 
were provided with a detailed list of them, this would not solve 
the problem. A customs official is not a biologist, and it is an 
impossible problem for him to distinguish the horn of a Siberian 
stag, the musk of a musk deer, or a bear's gall bladder from 
other parts and preparations whose shipment is no crime at all. 
  On the other hand, even if customs were to manage to prevent 
the shipment of one rare species or another out of the country, 
there arises the problem of what to do with them after that. 
There are no customs points with especially equipped points for 
keeping confiscated animals, and if they are confiscated they 
are very frequently doomed to death. The situation is 
complicated by the fact that after the elimination of the USSR 
the majority of its former republics simply have no time for 
controlling their fauna and flora. Under these conditions, 
Russia, as successor to the Union, with the agreement of other 
republics, was forced to take charge of issuing permits for 
shipping out representatives of disappearing species of the 
animal and vegetable kingdoms from Belarus, Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine as 
well. But it will not be possible to arrange any kind of strict 
control of the situation in these countries in the near future. 
  The concern of the international community about the growing 
scale of illegal business in the former USSR developed into 
holding an international seminar on problems of illegal trade in 
representatives of wild flora and fauna at the end of last year 
in Moscow. Hot on its tracks, the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources held a meeting of the collegium 
at which they prepared a draft governmental resolution calling 
for support for Russia's fulfillment of its international 
commitments. One of the main measures of the proposed government 
decree is to instruct the Customs Committee, the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, the Russian Federation Procuracy, and other 
departments to take a number of effective measures to step up 
control over gathering rare plants and animals, trading in them, 
and allowing them to cross the border. But it is not likely that 
it will be possible to carry out what has been earmarked sooner 
than in a couple of years. For now it would be better for the 
disappearing animals in Russia to rely on their own legs and 
natural instincts in their fight with domestic businessmen and 
foreign poachers.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Zilanov, deputy chairman of the Russian </F>
Fisheries Committee: ``Caspian Dialogue''] 
  [Text] Negotiations by representatives of the 
governments of all five Caspian states: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, 
Iran, Russia, and Turkmenistan about preparation of the draft of 
an agreement on conservation and utilization of bioresources of 
the Caspian Sea took place in Ashgabat, the capital of 
Turkmenistan. Vyacheslav Zilanov comments on results of the 
Ashgabat meeting. 
  With the disintegration of the Soviet Union and formation of 
new states with access to the Caspian Sea there was not only a 
shift in the geopolitical situation here but some radical 
changes in economic ties in every sphere as well, including 
utilization of bioresources and primarily the fishing resources 
of the Caspian Sea. They have always played a significant role 
in the feeding of the population of the Caspian states, while 
the sturgeon resources also constituted a legacy of the entire 
world community. The Caspian Sea basin is a world larder of five 
main species of the sturgeon family: beluga, starred sturgeon, 
Russian sturgeon, sturgeon Acipenser, and sterlet, which account 
for up to 90 percent of the world catch. Thanks to the efforts 
of domestic scientists and practical workers a scientifically 
substantiated system was worked out for reproduction, 
conservation, and rational fishing of the sturgeon family under 
conditions of regulated rivers and a deterioration in the 
ecological condition of the water systems. It is based on 
prohibition of sea fishing, restriction of river fishing, 
controls over fishing and a complex of reproductive measures. 
  Unfortunately this system which was operating successfully 
for more than 30 years, started disintegrating. There is a 
tumultuous increase in sea poaching since funds for protection 
services are lacking in the new states, and even Russia eased 
control over its own fishing operations because of financial 
difficulties, inadequacies of the legislative basis, creation of 
numerous owners, and for other reasons. In addition to that 
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan want to fish 
independently in their fishery zones, as formerly done by Iran, 
at the same time cooperating with Russia in the conservation, 
reproduction, and rational utilization of sturgeon reserves. 
  Thus, in the past cooperation was organized between two 
states--USSR and Iran, whereas at present there is the task of 
reaching agreement on equal and mutually advantageous 
cooperation in the conservation of Caspian Sea bioresources of 
five states. It was for that purpose that the third and final 
round of negotiations took place in Ashgabat (previous talks 
were held in Astrakhan and Enzeli (Iran). 
  In the course of the Ashgabat talks (and they were 
difficult!), with the exception of two points, it was possible 
to reach agreement among all the Caspian delegations with regard 
to the text of the agreement on conservation and utilization of 
Caspian Sea bioresources. This agreement provides for the 
creation of a reliable legal basis for broad mutual cooperation 
among all Caspian Sea states in rational fishing on the Caspian 
Sea exclusively on the basis of scientific data and appropriate 
international control over fishing. It is planned to create an 
international organ--the committee for conservation and 
utilization of bioresources of the Caspian Sea, in which 
representatives of Caspian Sea states will be able to discuss 
and adopt decisions on issues of interest to them dealing with 
conservation of reserves and fishing. An international 
inspection service is also being created. 
  With respect to the sturgeon family all delegations agreed 
in 
principle to the prohibition of fishing at sea with the 
exception of special cases under the control of an international 
organ and the inspection service. Fishing for sprat, however, 
will be continued in areas of the sea traditionally used for 
that, but significant legal changes may take place in this area 
as well. The matter is that the main assimilated sprat fishing 
grounds are located close to the coasts of the Azerbaijan 
Republic and Turkmenistan whose delegations during the 
negotiations declared their intention of establishing fishing 
grounds 40 miles wide. These proposals found the support of 
delegations from Iran and Kazakhstan, which proposed narrower 
grounds of 25 to 30 miles. It should be noted that at the start 
of negotiations Turkmenistan declared the establishment of 
12-mile territorial waters which was not anticipated by our 
delegation. Russia, however, considers that under conditions for 
preserving the traditions of sprat production and creating equal 
fishing conditions for fishermen of all the Caspian Sea states 
it would be best to preserve the existing fishing ground with a 
width of 10 to 12 miles and a maximum of 15 miles. A final 
decision was not made specifically because of differences with 
regard to that issue. 
  The second matter in dispute was the site of a future 
headquarters of the committee's international organ. Two states 
are currently seeking it: Russia (Astrakhan) and Iran (Enzeli). 
I believe that in this case a decision may be reached with 
consideration of the scientific base available to each side and 
the possibilities of ensuring appropriate work by the commission 
secretariat. Our delegation, which included Anatoliy Guzhvin, 
head of administration of Astrakhan Oblast, promoted the 
selection of Astrakhan. No final decision has yet been reached. 
  After three rounds of negotiations it became absolutely 
clear 
that with any expansion of the fishing grounds losses would be 
suffered primarily by Russian fishermen from Astrakhan, 
Dagestan, and Kalmykia. With the different variants of the 
grounds of from 20 to 40 miles, these losses of the Russians 
will amount to from 40 to 100 percent of the annual catch for 
sprat. In that connection achievement of an agreement regarding 
the width of the grounds, in my opinion, is up to the 
politicians. A delay, however, could lead to the uncontrolled 
development of extensive sea fishing which poses a great threat 
primarily for the sturgeon family. It would be highly desirable 
to sign the agreement in early 1994. We are hoping that this is 
understood by all Caspian Sea states. At Ashgabat the 
delegations agreed to thoroughly study the viewpoints of the 
sides, reporting them to their governments and coordinating a 
final decision on the width of the fishing grounds and the site 
of the committee's headquarters through diplomatic channels. 
  Unfortunately there are ``underwater reefs'' confronting the 
draft fishing agreement. I have in mind the hullabaloo around 
the prospecting and extraction of oil and gas on the Caspian Sea 
shelf. In that connection some of our partners wanted to create 
wide fishing grounds for the sake of ``the black gold'' and even 
divide all of the Caspian Sea into sectors. Biological 
resources, however are indivisible, they are interrelated, while 
fish, and especially sturgeon, do not recognize any borders. I 
am assuming that the ``underwater oil and gas reefs'' can halt 
the ``fishing vessel'' of five Caspian Sea states en route to a 
common agreement only temporarily, but it is impossible to 
ground it. The fishermen know only too well that biological 
resources can benefit mankind forever only with their wise 
utilization on the basis of equal and mutually advantageous 
collaboration.

  [Text] Nikolay Shapovalenko, chief of the section to 
supervise radioactive security of defense sites, declared to 
Interfax that Russia's Defense Ministry and Navy had occupied a 
non-constructive position with respect to control over the 
storage of liquid radioactive wastes at military facilities on 
the part of the State committee on atomic supervision. 
  In his words, the Defense Ministry refers to the fact that 
civil departments abroad have never supervised such kind of 
military activity. Shapovalenko pointed out that the Defense 
Minister should issue a decree to bring into force a provision 
on the State committee on atomic supervision in the ministry's 
structure because ``it is difficult to establish a single state 
system of supervision over radioactive security on Russia's 
territory without this.'' 
  Shapovalenko declared that last December a working group of 
the Environment and Natural Resources Ministry prepared a report 
for the government to solve the problem with liquid radioactive 
wastes. In particular, it proposes to forward membrane devices 
to reprocess nuclear wastes, which have been designed by the 
association Radon, to the Pacific Fleet for test exploitation. 
  In addition, he said, ``we have accepted Japan's proposal 
which will hand over a dual-bottom tanker to Russia to store 
10,000 tons of liquid radioactive wastes. However, the 
government must consider the issue on the construction of 
facilities to reprocess liquid radioactive wastes on the 
Northern and Pacific Fleets and several regional burial places 
in order to entirely resolve this problem.'' 
  A feasibility study for a burial place on the territory of 
the former nuclear test range on Novaya Zemlya has been already 
prepared and subjected to state ecological expertise. ``The same 
burial place should be created in the Far East, but if we start 
construction this year it will be concluded not earlier than 
1997,'' said Shapovalenko. 
  He reported that a facility capable of reprocessing 8,000 
cubic meters of liquid radioactive wastes annually will be 
assembled on the Kola peninsula on the basis of the water 
purification station of the Murmansk sea steamship line. 
Shapovalenko said that the Murmansk steamship line is ready to 
accept wastes from military crafts assigned to the Northern 
Fleet on a commercial basis.

  [Text] Moscow, January 11 (TASS) -- Russia and the United 
States of America are planning to hold a joint conference on 
environmental protection in 1994. An initiative belongs to the 
Russian Space agency and the CIA. 
  The Russian Ministry of Ecology also has shown interest in 
taking part in the conference. Its experts believe that the 
forum will draft joint scientific approaches towards ecological 
problems. The two countries should coordinate methods and 
instruments for estimating the state of the environment, norms 
of top permissible concentrations of pollution, levels of 
radiation, noise, vibrations, magnetic field and other 
hazardious factors. 
  One of the tasks of the forthcoming conference is supposed 
to 
be the development of joint decisions on environment monitoring 
from the space, especially of the areas of nuclear power plants 
and other dangerous objects.

chemical disarmament in their own interests. Journalists are 
citing unverified facts, and people weighed down with science 
degrees are now trying to draw attention to themselves by making 
revelatory statements. The press increasingly often carries 
articles in which so-called chemical weapons experts who like to 
pose as major specialists try to intimidate the public with 
reports on the alleged continuation of scientific research into 
chemical weapons, their unauthorized destruction, secret burials 
on land and in water, and so forth. 
  In our view, such activity by ``experts'' and ``selfless 
campaigners'' is pursuing an unseemly aim: Using unverified and 
sometimes knowingly false statistics, they juggle this 
information around and impose on the public a distorted and 
unobjective view of the problem of the destruction of chemical 
weapons. 
  That is why I consider it expedient to examine consistently 
the basic stages in the implementation of the 1993 Convention on 
the Banning of Chemical Weapons. 
  First of all, I would recall that the state, which 
signed the Convention, is beginning work on the destruction of 
chemical weapons within a maximum of two years and will complete 
it no more than 10 years after the convention's entry into 
force. In the first stage, that is no more than two years after 
the ratification of the Convention, tests of the first facility 
for the destruction of chemical weapons will be carried out and 
then, no more than three years later, at least 1 percent of the 
stocks of these weapons is to be destroyed. In Russia's case 
this will mean 400 tonnes of toxic agents. In the subsequent 
stages, which are to be carried out no later than five, seven, 
and 10 years after the convention's entry into force, at least 
20-45 percent of the weapons are to be destroyed, as are 
eventually all the remaining stocks of chemical weapons. Each 
state will choose its own method of destruction independently. 
It should be noted that the destruction process is to 
correspond to the very latest scientific achievements and be 
carried out at specially equipped sites. Meanwhile the 
destruction of toxic agents by burial on land, underwater, or by 
incineration in the open air is not permitted. 
  According to specialists' estimates, as far as Russia is 
concerned the Convention on Banning Chemical Weapons could come 
into force in 1995 and the operation of the first facility for 
the destruction of toxic agents could begin in 1997. Russian 
President B. N. Yeltsin made a statement in spring last year in 
which he said among other things: ``The world has changed, 
Russia's position in the world has changed, and we do not intend 
to attack anyone. The time has come to get rid of chemical 
weapons -- they are the past which we have inherited.'' Let us 
note that the problem of the destruction of chemical weapons is 
of great sociopolitical and social significance for Russia, due 
first and foremost to the need to lower the level of ecological 
tension in regions where the arsenals of these weapons are 
based. The program for the destruction of chemical weapons that 
the state is elaborating gives priority to the unconditional 
guarantee of safeguarding the life and health of the population 
as well as measures to protect the environment. 
  Social protection is also envisaged for the population 
living 
in zones where enterprises for the destruction of chemical 
weapons are to be sited: The latest technologies will be used 
and the volumes of toxic substances to be shipped across 
Russia's territory will be kept to a minimum. All this will 
involve considerable material expenditure especially since there 
is no special-purpose industrial facility for the destruction of 
chemical weapons in the Russian Federation. 
  The Committee on Problems of the Chemical and Biological 
Weapons Convention has been created to coordinate the 
verification of the fulfillment of international commitments in 
the sphere of the destruction of chemical and biological 
weapons. The policy of chemical disarmament in Russia has long 
needed an agency which would be independent of such powerful 
structures as the Defense Ministry and enterprises in the 
military-industrial complex, could carry out the process of 
disarmament in our country in a highly skilled and objective 
way, and could worthily represent Russia's interests in the 
international arena. Academician A. Kuntsevich, the well known 
scientist, was appointed chairman of this committee. In the 
past a military chemist, he made a major contribution to the 
creation of decontamination procedures which render toxic 
substances harmless and he set up a scientific school. 
  ...Today all Russia's chemical weapons stocks are housed in 
special-purpose arsenals of the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry -- these are the seven chemical ``thorns'' in Russia's 
side: the city of Kambarka and the settlement of Kizner 
(Udmurtia), the settlement of Gornyy (Saratov Oblast), the city 
of Shchuchye (Kurgan Oblast), the city of Pochep (Bryansk 
Oblast), the settlement of Leonilovka (Penza Oblast), and the 
settlement of Maradykovskiy (Kirov Oblast). The total quantity 
of chemical weapons is 40,000 tonnes, made up as follows: 
organophosphorous toxic agents (sarin, zamin [as 
transliterated], and VX) -- 32,300 tonnes; mustard gas, 
lewisite, and their compounds -- 7,700 tonnes; and phosgene -- 
5,000 tonnes. If the Paris convention is ratified, the process 
of the destruction of these weapons should begin in 1997. 
  To enable the Russian Federation to fulfill its 
international 
commitments, the Committee on Problems of the Chemical and 
Biological Weapons Convention under the Russian Federation 
President, in conjunction with the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry, the Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology, the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Health, the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, and other ministries, elaborated in 1992 the draft 
first stage of the comprehensive program for the destruction of 
chemical weapons. Leaders of local administrations and 
representatives of public organizations in those regions where 
it is planned to site facilities for the destruction of chemical 
weapons took part in the discussion of this program. The draft 
was adopted after comments, amendments, and clarifications. 
  An essential condition of work on the draft is the public 
discussion of proposed decisions, a state ecological feasibility 
study of them, and the elaboration of the corresponding 
legislative acts. It is also recommended that a federal 
targeted program be elaborated to eliminate the consequences of 
the production of chemical weapons on the territory of the 
Russian Federation. 
  The chemical ``thorns'' can be removed from Russia's side 
only if there is a skilled, comprehensive, and well-balanced 
approach to the problem of the destruction of chemical weapons 
and joint efforts by scientific specialists, state and public 
organizations, and the local administration and population of 
the regions where the installations for the destruction of 
chemical weapons, one of the most treacherous types of weapon of 
mass destruction, are to be sited.

  [Text] Moscow, 13 Jan--The impact of rocket launches into 
space is most marked in the fall zones for the residue of spent 
carrier rockets. At present, 18.8 million hectares of land in 
the territory of four CIS states (Russia, Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan) are employed as fall zones, and 
the Plesetsk cosmodrome uses almost half of this--9 million 
hectares of Russian land--for this purpose. 
  The Ecos program to improve the ecological situation in the 
fall zones, which involves the cleanup of fallen spent rocket 
elements, a decrease of rocket fuel remnants from spent 
carrier-rocket stages, and a reduction in the amount and size of 
fall zones, is at present being implemented using Russian 
Defense Ministry funds. 
  The largest fall zone area--in Archangel oblast--is 3.5 
million hectares (almost 6 percent of the oblast's total area). 
Ecological cleanup subunits begin their field season there 
every July. The servicemen gather into containers the fragments 
of carrier-rocket stages, which are then taken to storage depots. 
  Almost 4.5 million hectares of land in Russia is used as 
fall 
zones for the spent parts of carrier-rockets launched from the 
Baykonur cosmodrome, over half of this land being located in 
Tomsk Oblast (about 2 million hectares) and Novosibirsk Oblast 
(almost 1 million hectares). 
  In 1993, the fall zone areas for the first stages of the 
R-7A 
family of carrier-rockets (``Soyuz'' and ``Molniya'') were 
reduced by 10 percent. This process is continuing. About 
500,000 hectares will be returned to users in Tomsk and 
Novosibirsk Oblasts because seven fall zones have ceased to be 
used. In this connection, specialists emphasize that the 
problem of reducing fall zone areas can be radically tackled 
only if one employs the controlled descent of spent 
carrier-rocket elements on aerodynamic structures that can be 
unfurled such as parachutes, paragliders, and air balloons. 
However the Russians have no money to fund this work. The 
Russian Federation Parachute-Building Research Institute has had 
to develop a gliding parachute, although it was indeed for the 
French Ariane-5 carrier-rocket.

  [Text] An official from Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry has 
denied writer Ales Adamovich's statement that a quantity of 
plutonium had been dumped into one of the Siberian lakes. 
  Vladislav Kotlov, a senior official at the Atomic Energy 
Ministry's press service, told Interfax that the statement of 
Adamovich, who said on Thursday that about a ton of plutonium 
was buried in a lake in Tomsk Region about 20 years ago, was 
absurd because a ton of that material costs billions of dollars. 
  Besides, Kotlov said, the Siberian Chemical Plant, situated 
in Tomsk Region, had been burying all its radioactive waste 
underground, though in an area with subsoil waters. This was 
confirmed by the Atomic Energy Ministry's press service, which 
said the buried waste had a total radioactivity of one billion 
curies. 
  Kotlov said laws were due to come out shortly banning the 
burial of radioactive waste underground in areas with subsoil 
waters. ``There are no guarantees that there will be no 
earthquakes in areas where burial sites are located, which may 
lead to the spread of radioactive substances,'' he said. 
  There are also underground burial sites near Krasnoyarsk 
(Siberia) and Dimitrovgrad (Ulyanovsk Region), Kotlov said. 
  Sources in the Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources, Gosatomnadzor (the State Nuclear 
Inspectorate) and the Tomsk Regional Environmental Committee 
told Interfax those bodies had no data to confirm the 
information of Adamovich, who said he had documents to prove his 
statement.

  [Text] Moscow January 20 TASS -- Russia rejected a tanker 
offered by Japan for the storage of liquid radioactive waste 
after a commission of Russian experts examined the tanker and 
came to the conclusion that it was not suitable for this purpose 
because of its characteristics and present condition, according 
to an official of the Russian Ministry for Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources. 
  When it gave up last October dumping liquid radioactive 
waste 
into the Sea of Japan, the Russian side counted on foreign 
assistance, specifically that of Japan, in building a storage 
for this waste in the Far East. However, so far Russia has not 
been rendered such assistance. For this reason, the issue of 
dumping radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan is left open. 
  According to the ministry official, Japan did not restrict 
its initiative by offering Russia one tanker only. The other 
day, two more tankers have been offered, which are to be 
examined by Russian experts in near future.

power generation concept; figures in brackets denote broadcast

  [Text] [131118] [Unidentified correspondent over 
video of exterior, interior of unidentified nuclear power 
station] As is generally known, despite all the advantages 
of electricity generation at nuclear power stations, there is 
also one great disadvantage -- the likelihood of the occurrence 
of an uncontrolled reaction, an explosion, or a meltdown of the 
active zone of the reactor. We all recall the Chernobyl tragedy 
and other similar accidents. 
  Now a new concept has been submitted to the European 
Organization for Nuclear Research -- generation of electricity 
at a nuclear power station linked with a particle accelerator. 
The new reactor will be operating in a subcritical mode which 
rules out the occurrence of a chain reaction. The electricity 
will be supplied from particle accelerators. According to 
experts the new power generation technique will be competitive 
since it does not require new technological development while at 
the same time providing an ecologically relatively clean, 
inexhaustible, and reliable source of energy. [131205]

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Kryuchkov and Gennadiy Dernovoy, </F>
leading specialists at the Institute of High Energy Physics, 
under ``Sensation!'' rubric: ``Explosive Idea, But There Will 
Be No Disaster''] 
  [Text] Protvino, Moscow Oblast -- The Chernobyl disaster 
bluntly raised the question: Should we have nuclear power or 
not? These worries are understandable. An accident whose 
probability is assessed as ``one incident in 10,000 years'' 
occurred at the initial phase of the mass operation of powerful 
nuclear reactors. Should we be surprised at the demonstrations 
by ``greens'' at AES [nuclear electric power station] units in 
operation, and the bans and all kinds of restrictions which have 
swept across the whole world? However, it is easier to impose a 
ban than to build a safe AES. Scientists from many countries 
have continued to struggle over the problem. These include 
employees of our High Energy Physics Institute. And today we 
can say: A safe method of producing nuclear power has been 
found. 
  For those who have forgotten their school physics course, we 
will remind you: A conventional nuclear reactor works on the 
principle of a self-propagating chain reaction. The operating 
regime has been selected to ensure that the number of neutrons 
is constant all the time and is strictly monitored. The balance 
is utterly precise, otherwise an explosion would ensue. 
However, even the most complex multiple backup systems for 
monitoring and automatic protection control only reduce the risk 
of an accident. 
  But we have elaborated a fundamentally different method of 
producing nuclear energy which rules out the very possibility of 
a disaster. The essence of it is that the subcritical reactor 
-- that is, one that is not operating of its own accord -- is 
illuminated by a beam of particles dispersed in an accelerator. 
Splitting the nuclei they meet in their path, they generate a 
powerful, rapidly expanding cascade of secondary particles. 
These in their turn split a large number of target nuclei. 
There takes place a complex multistage process of the birth and 
capture of the gradually decelerating particles, at the end of 
which the division of the nuclei occurs, as in a conventional 
reactor, accompanied by the release of an enormous quantity of 
energy. In other words, the process only operates when the 
accelerator is working. 
  The idea of the new energy producing system is attractive 
not 
just because it means that repetitions of disasters on the scale 
of Chernobyl are impossible. The likelihood of smaller 
accidents at AES's, caused by a leakage of the cooling agent in 
the active zone, is also decreased. Special requirements for 
the construction materials in the subcritical reactors also 
enhances its [as published] safety. Furthermore, nonenriched 
uranium can be used in them, which decreases both the cost of 
the energy obtained and the risk of the uncontrolled use of 
enriched uranium. We should add that the subcritical reactor 
produces not only energy but also the additional nuclear fuel by 
which it operates. 
  We have spoken several times about our discovery in 
scientific publications. Announcements have been made in the 
open press too. And suddenly there are ``sensational reports'' 
that in Switzerland the physicist Carlo Rubia has developed a 
new ``direction in nuclear power engineering.'' As it turned 
out, the essence of this direction coincides with what we have 
described. Truly, there is no prophet in his own land. 
However, we are prepared to argue about who should bear the 
palm. But for us, something else is far more important at the 
moment: Why has a safe reactor not yet been built? The answer 
is simple: There is no money. All the research on this topic 
in our institute has been done by a group of specialists on the 
basis of enthusiasm alone. The money allocated is not even 
enough to operate the unique accelerator. It is standing idle, 
while the construction of an accelerator-accumulator complex has 
essentially been frozen. The following question begs to be 
asked: What is more advantageous -- to find money to build safe 
AES's today, or to seek out money tomorrow to eliminate new 
Chernobyls?

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Yablokov, chairman of the Security </F>
Council Interdepartmental Commission for Environmental Safety: 
``The Ecological Condition of the Country Is Catastrophic: 
Response to the Minister of Environment and Natural Resources of 
Russia''] 
  [Text] ``In the past three years there has been no 
deterioration in the ecological situation in the country as a 
whole,'' ``...today's situation may be assessed more 
optimistically than before,'' ``...the most dangerous spheres 
... we are keeping under constant supervision.'' All these 
assessments of Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, minister of environment 
and natural resources of Russia, contained in his interview in 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (No. 251 (675) of 30 December 1993) are so 
different from what is actually happening in Russia that it is 
hard to remain silent. I cannot remain silent for the added 
reason that the gentleman minister has also appreciably 
distorted my positions in the sphere of the country's 
environmental safety. 
  In fact, the ecological state of the country is not simply 
disturbing, it is catastrophic. Russians' life expectancy is 
falling precipitously, and the number of diseases connected with 
the poor state of the environment is growing. A boy born in 1993 
has few chances of reaching retirement age. Inasmuch as the 
state of the environment is responsible for approximately 30 
percent of our health, one year out of the three years of 
decline in average life expectancy in 1993 is accounted for by 
the environment. 
  Soil-degradation processes are intensifying. The scale of 
the 
country's radiation contamination has not been reduced. Each 
year in Moscow and other large and small cities there are 
hundreds of sources of dangerous radiation. Among the reasons 
for the radiation contamination are the accidents at sites of 
radiation danger, the unthinking use of radioactive materials, 
the destabilization of the work of the radioactive waste burial 
services, and the penetration of our territory by foreign waste. 
The ozone hole over the country is getting larger. Last year it 
was the largest in all the years of observation. This means 
thousands of additional deaths and dangerous consequences for 
agriculture and live nature. 
  The expanding poaching has brought the Amur tiger and a 
whole 
number of other protected animals to the brink of extinction. 
The state of fish resources is characterized by a single word: 
plunder. The poaching of sturgeon in the Caspian and the Volga, 
which has exceeded all conceivable bounds, is making realistic 
the complete termination of their catch within two years and the 
destruction of a number of sturgeon as species within a few 
years. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources has not 
yet complied with President Yeltsin's instructions of more than 
a year ago that sturgeon be accorded the status of federal 
natural resource (some attempt at protecting them, at least!). 
  The broad-based contamination of the country as a result of 
breaks in the oil and gas pipelines continues. The area of 
forest is being reduced, and serious pollution of Baykal 
continues. The destruction of the sites of the traditional use 
of natural resources of the small peoples of the North is not 
being reduced but expanded. The scale of the rise of ground 
water on the country's territory is increasing (40 percent of 
the territory is threatened with rising ground water in Moscow). 
  I have listed far from all our ecological disasters. But 
even 
this is sufficient for evaluating the words of the gentleman 
minister quoted above as being very far from reality. 
  ``Neither I nor the Ministry of Environment and Natural 
Resources have yet been defeated on a single matter of 
principle,'' the minister maintains. How much self-deception 
there is in this claim is not that important. In actual fact, 
the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources has not won on 
a single major issue. In the two years and six months of its 
existence the ministry has not resolved one of the main problems 
of state administration in this sphere: A formula of the optimum 
combination of the need for federal regulation of the use of 
natural resources and supervision of wildlife management with 
the right of components of the Federation to use their natural 
resources has not been found. The public funding of the sector 
is such that the entire system of the Ministry of Environment 
and Natural Resources is close to collapse. The plunder of 
natural resources is not diminishing but increasing. The 
Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources has yet to devise 
all the necessary standards and rules ensuing from the law on 
environmental protection adopted more than two years ago. The 
minister, as chairman of the government commission, held up for 
more than a year the development of a system of measures ensuing 
from the decisions of the UN Conference on Stable Development 
which Russia signed in Rio de Janeiro. The ministry has on 
dozens of occasions in the past two years occupied the position 
of detached observer at the time of the government's adoption of 
decisions dangerous for the ecological state of the country. The 
principle of the separation of state administration of the use 
of natural resources from state supervision of wildlife 
management, which has been established by law, has not been put 
into practice (hunting and fishing resources, for example, are 
used and supervised by the same structures). The ministry has 
not organized the efficient work of the federal Ecology Fund. 
The system of wildlife areas, which was for a long time a model 
for other countries, is falling apart on account of a lack of 
funds. The interestingly conceived ``Environmental Safety of 
Russia'' program has one foot in the grave. The natural-resource 
bloc in the government has not succeeded in realizing the idea. 
If none of this is not called a defeat, what, then, is a defeat? 
  I shall dwell in more detail on the government's decision on 
the development of nuclear power engineering of 28 December 
1992, which the gentleman minister mentions repeatedly. I spoke 
at that session about the impermissibility of a resumption of 
the construction of nuclear electric power stations for 
ecological, legal, and economic reasons. The law does not permit 
the adoption of such decisions without the positive findings of 
expert ecological appraisal. This was confirmed at that same 
session by Justice Minister Nikolay Fedorov (today president of 
Chuvashia) also. All was decided, however, by the speech of the 
minister of environment, who supported, however monstrous, the 
position of the Ministry of Atomic Energy. Public anger at this 
decision of the government developed into an appeal to the 
Constitutional Court, which, as we know, took over this case. 
  I emphasized once again at that session that I am not an 
opponent of nuclear energy in principle (as the gentleman 
minister tries to portray me), but I am for its environmentally 
safe development. In Russia, however, the development of nuclear 
power engineering according to the proposed plans entails 
unacceptable environmental risk. It is indicative, incidentally, 
that several months later the State Expert Ecological Appraisal 
(in the absence of the gentlemen minister, it is true--perhaps 
the status of ``politician,'' as he calls himself, was reflected 
here) declined to approve the program of development of the 
country's nuclear power engineering presented by the Ministry of 
Atomic Energy. And, of course, our gentleman minister 
dissembles, to put it mildly, when he says that that ill-fated 
decree made no provision for the funding of the Ministry of 
Atomic Energy. It was merely to untie the Ministry of Atomic 
Energy's hands in the funding of the sector that this decision 
was adopted! 
  I am forced to censure the gentleman minister at least for 
incompetence for his claim that that decree contained no 
``specific projects that experts could examine.'' Both in 
accordance with the law and in accordance with IAEA rules, the 
choice of site is the first part of construction. To what expert 
ecological appraisal was the decision on the choice of sites for 
the Far East, Kostroma, and other nuclear powers stations, of 
which the government decree makes mention, put? 
  There has long been the need for public discussion of all 
problems of the development of power engineering: It first needs 
to be decided how much energy we need and where, and then we 
need to determine from which sources to obtain this energy. 
Meanwhile, however, it would seem that we do not have a shortage 
but a surplus of energy, and we should not be building up 
capacity but learning from other countries how to consume half 
as much energy per unit of manufactured product. 
  I would add that the Ministry of Environment and Natural 
Resources has done little as yet to attract attention in Russia 
to the new progressive sources of energy--steam and gas 
turbines, the technology of the combustion of coal in a 
fluidized bed, and others. Yet there are calculations showing 
that the replacement of all nuclear power station units (not 
only those being withdrawn owing to old age) by environmentally 
acceptable energy sources would be for Russia several times (!) 
cheaper than bringing the current nuclear power stations up to 
safety requirements similar to their Western counterparts. 
  Now a little about the minister as a politician (this, I 
would recall, is what he called himself). 
  It had become clear at the start of 1992 that neither the 
ministry, nor the government, nor the Supreme Soviet had the 
resources for resolving the problems of environmental 
protection. A ``mustering of all units'' was needed, and the 
First All-Russia Ecology and Environmental Protection Congress, 
which could have adopted a program of Russia's ecological 
revival, was seen as being such. Earlier such programs had been 
adopted by the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of 
Ministers, but this could no longer be done now by the competent 
structures alone without the most active participation of 
industrialists, science, the banks, and the public. All were 
agreed that such a congress needed to be prepared as a matter of 
urgency, and the corresponding action program, which had been 
discussed at the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources 
Collegium, was drawn up. But the minister personally revised the 
decision of the collegium and persuaded A. Rutskoy to head the 
organizing committee preparing the congress. The latter agreed, 
provided, it is said, that he would not be burdened with any 
congress business. This buried with full honors the whole idea 
of the congress: The minister needed not a congress but 
political proximity to Rutskoy, and Rutskoy needed a congress 
even less. So an ecology congress did not take place in 1993. 
Now the idea of the congress has been taken up by the trade 
union movement. I very much hope that such a congress will be 
held, for all that, and will assist this as best as I can. 
  And I would like to say this, further, about politics. The 
gentleman minister explains his involvement in the elections on 
the Russia's Choice platform by the fact that this movement 
``expressed interest in the development of a strong ecological 
program.'' But where is it, this strong ecological program, and 
why has our government up to now declined to develop and 
implement it? For anyone with an interest in the parties' and 
movements' ecological programs it is obvious that the Russia's 
Choice ecological program is far from the strongest. It would 
seem that it was not ecological but some other policy which 
guided the minister in this case, as in the case with A. Rutskoy 
also. 
  Not only my attention, I believe, was attracted by the 
minister's attempt to justify the combination of positions in 
the government and in parliament by an analogy with other 
countries. In other countries the situation is fundamentally 
different from ours, there the members of the party which is the 
winner at the elections become ministers. With us, on the other 
hand, ministers occupy the seats of deputies. And it is quite 
odd when a minister is elected by territorial constituency. How 
can he combine the duty of serving primarily the interests of 
his constituency with his federal obligations of not having 
``favorites'' in the regions? I would recall that our minister 
attempted to get elected from Nizhegorod Oblast (because, 
perhaps, there are many Ministry of Atomic Energy enterprises 
there) and that only after having failed there was he included 
in the extraterritorial part of the Russia's Choice federal 
slate. 
  A progressive economist who understands that a sound economy 
may exist only with a sound ecology was proposed for the 
position of minister in November 1991. It is said that Suvorov, 
shaken by the scale of the embezzlement of public funds, 
maintained that any supply officer could after a year be 
executed without trial or investigation. It would seem that the 
minister of environment, even if very good at the time of his 
appointment, needs to be removed after 18 months at the most: A 
person is incapable of resisting for any longer than this the 
pressure of his superiors, minister friends, and foreign 
companies. 
  The gentleman minister's striking super-optimism, whatever 
the subject--the efficiency of the work of the ministry or of 
himself or the quality of the environment--is helping him, 
evidently, justify his own inconsistency and indecisiveness in 
defense of the environment. But for the state and society and 
for us all this political position of the minister is simply 
dangerous. 
  P.S. As presidential adviser for the environment and health 
care in 1991-1993, I was largely responsible for the failures in 
the sphere of ecology that have been described, as also for the 
self-appointment of Professor V.I. Danilov-Danilyan as minister. 
The Statute on the Security Council of Russia Interdepartmental 
Commission for Environmental Safety, recently approved by the 
president, records: ``The commission's decisions... are to be 
examined by the organs of state power....'' If also I fail to 
achieve serious results here, I will have to move to 
nongovernment structures in order to start all over again--to 
organize public pressure on the persons adopting ecologically 
dangerous decisions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Danilov-Danilyan, Russian minister of </F>
environmental protection, conducted by Andrey Bayduzhiy under 
the heading ``Firsthand: Viktor Danilov-Danilyan: `A Minister, 
Even a Minister of Environmental Protection, Is Still a 
Political Figure'''] 
  [Text] Viktor Danilov-Danilyan was born in Moscow in 
1938. He is a 1960 graduate of Moscow State University's 
Department of Mechanics and Mathematics. He got his scientific 
training (in 1964-76) working at the USSR Academy of Sciences 
Central Institute of Economics and Mathematics, a center of 
``economic dissent'' where mathematics served as the Aesopian 
language of market-oriented economists. In the latter half of 
the 1970's he was head of a laboratory at the USSR Scientific 
Research Institute for the Study of Systems. In the 1980's he 
established and headed the Department of Ecology under the USSR 
Council of Ministers Economic Academy. He took charge of the 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources in 
late 1991. Danilov-Danilyan is a doctor of economic sciences and 
a professor. He is married and has two sons. 
  Bayduzhiy: What is your assessment of the current 
environmental situation in Russia? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: It is very alarming. Ecological 
systems are very vulnerable, and the first steps toward 
destruction of our country's environment were taken back in the 
1930's, when we began industrializing without the slightest 
regard for the environment. There was the Stalinist plan for 
transformation of nature, a plan that declared human beings to 
be nature's master. We did not renounce that concept even when 
in the late 1960's all the developed countries concluded that we 
must live in harmony with nature. 
  The current environmental situation was almost fully defined 
10-12 years ago, i.e. in the early 1980's. That applies both to 
Russia as a whole and to its individual regions. An additional 
``contribution'' was made by the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. 
Over the past three years our country's environmental situation 
has on the whole not worsened. That is due to two factors. 
Firstly, the decline in production has played a certain role, 
due to the accompanying decrease in pollutant emissions. Though 
for fairness' sake I must add that the decrease in industrial 
pollution has been smaller than the drop in production. There is 
nothing surprising about that: the first thing that enterprises 
do when they find themselves in a difficult situation is to cut 
corners on environmental protection. First they shut down 
pollution control equipment, and only after that do they shut 
down production operations. Nevertheless, the amount of 
pollutant emissions in Russia has gone down. 
  The second factor that has prevented the state of the 
environment from worsening in recent years is that beginning in 
1988 our country began taking steps to create an environmental 
protection system. 1988 was the year that a USSR environmental 
protection agency was established, followed by republic and 
local agencies. These organizational steps, accompanied by the 
introduction of an economic mechanism to regulate natural 
resource use, have definitely produced a positive effect. In 
December 1991 a law entitled ``On Environmental Protection'' was 
passed, making environmental impact assessments mandatory for 
all projects. Incidentally, that stipulation is being followed 
very strictly. In 1992 more than 55,000 project documents were 
prepared at the federal and regional levels, and nine percent of 
them were rejected in their entirety. In 1991 30 percent of all 
documents were rejected. That means that people have become 
afraid of environmental impact assessment and are no longer 
submitting outright nonsense for assessment. 
  However, not all documents undergo environmental impact 
assessment, particularly those adopted at the highest level. For 
example, when the government passes a decree regarding 
development of a system of Black Sea ports, we cannot do an 
impact assessment of that document, simply because it does not 
outline any specific projects. Hence the conclusion that we need 
to expand the range of documents that undergo assessment. It 
will be necessary to pass several legislative acts before we can 
do so, and I think those acts will pass in 1994. 
  Bayduzhiy: How is the system of pollution payments 
structured? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: At the present time those 
payments are distributed between non-budgetary environmental 
funds and the budget. Overall, 90 percent of pollution payments 
go to non-budgetary funds at the federal level, federation 
component level and local level. Those three levels receive 9, 
27, and 54 percent of the funds, respectively. That is to say, 
more than one-half of all environmental protection money remains 
directly at the local level and is used for specific 
environmental protection projects. 
  Bayduzhiy: Currently many environmentalists are 
arguing over how to assess the environmental situation in Russia 
-- as a crisis or a full-blown disaster. Which viewpoint do you 
support? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: Neither one. One can only speak 
of a crisis situation with regard to a number of urban 
agglomerations and aquatic systems. For example, a crisis 
situation exists along the Iset River, which flows through 
Yekaterinburg, and in Lake Ladoga, and thus in the Neva River as 
well. Even the situation on the Volga is still in a pre-crisis 
state, though of course that is no reason for complacency. 
  Nor should we forget that Russia has 7 million square 
kilometers of land that have not been touched by commercial 
activity in any way whatsoever. No other country in the world 
has that. Excluding Antarctica, that is only a little bit less 
than in all the rest of the world combined. Therefore, if we 
were to talk in terms of a human ecological reserve, then lands 
in Russia would comprise the largest section of it. Essentially 
this includes one-third of Russia's territory. 
  Bayduzhiy: Are you more optimistic about the 
prospects for improving our country's environmental situation 
now than you were when you became minister? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: You know, strange as it may 
seem, the answer is yes. For example, when I became minister I 
was not certain that we would be able to collect pollution 
payments the way we should. Now that is happening. Of course, 
many enterprises simply do not have the money to pay, but that 
is another problem. Their debt continues to accumulate; the 
system itself is functioning. The problem is not the system, but 
rather our country's economic situation. I also had serious 
doubts about whether we would be able to get the environmental 
assessment system going. But now it is up and running. So in 
terms of many parameters one can view the situation in a more 
optimistic light than before. 
  Bayduzhiy: What is your view of Russian Navy 
dumping of radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan and the events 
that followed? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: The problem of how to deal with 
the radioactive wastes generated by nuclear submarines and 
icebreakers has been ignored for decades. We have accumulated a 
huge quantity of liquid radioactive wastes, which we have 
traditionally dumped at sea. All this was described in detail in 
a ``white book'' published in April 1993, a report containing 
data which even Western governments, our negotiation partners, 
are not eager to release. Maybe we revealed even more than we 
should have, but that is a different topic. It is clear that the 
process of liquid radioactive waste creation cannot be halted 
all at once, even if every nuclear reactor were to be shut down. 
In late summer 1993 our eastern bases experienced a critical 
situation, with all their storage tanks filled. Unless unloaded, 
one of the tankers could have literally fallen apart, and that 
is essentially what did happen to it a short time later. The 
decision was made to dump -- there was no other choice -- 900 
cubic meters of polluted water with a total radioactivity of 
0.38 curie into the Sea of Japan. That is an insignificant 
amount of radioactivity; that much is literally flying around in 
the air. By way of comparison, a conventional coal-fired 
heat-and-power station with a capacity of one million kilowatts 
releases at least one curie each day. Large stations release 
15-20 curies into the air every day. The dumping was carried out 
in Russia's economic zone, 180 kilometers off shore, in a part 
of the sea that is more than 3,000 meters deep. In the tanker's 
wake followed a hydrographic vessel, which failed to discover 
any levels in excess of normal background radiation. Therefore 
it is frivolous to say that ecological damage was done to 
anyone. A few days ago Japan officially acknowledged that. 
Japan's discharges of industrial waste into the Sea of Japan do 
the environment incomparably greater harm. There is no way to 
describe the uproar over the Russian liquid radioactive waste as 
anything but hysteria. However, that in no way means that 
efforts should not be made to find a solution to the radioactive 
waste problem. A report has already been prepared on a whole 
range of pertinent issues. In the near future it will be 
presented to the government and to countries that have expressed 
a desire to provide Russia with technical and financial 
assistance with its radioactive waste processing. Those are the 
United States, Canada, Norway, Holland, Japan and South Korea. 
Relying on our own efforts alone, the earliest we could end 
dumping of radioactive wastes at sea would be after the end of 
1995. 
  Bayduzhiy: Each day Russia experiences two 
accidents on oil and gas pipelines, it has one train wreck a 
week, and it has a major industrial accident once a month. Do 
you have the impression that we are on the verge of another 
Chernobyl? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: Actually, no, though to make any 
promises like that would be the purest foolhardiness -- anything 
is possible. However, the most dangerous industries, those where 
a disaster could have the most serious consequences, are closely 
monitored by us. Nuclear power plant operations have become much 
more orderly. Even the International Atomic Energy Agency just 
recently, to my great surprise, acknowledged that Chernobyl-type 
reactors, the RBMK, may continue to be operated, i.e. that they 
do not significantly deviate from international safety 
standards. That also came as a surprise to many technical 
specialists. 
  Bayduzhiy: But in addition to nuclear power 
facilities we also have at least as many hazardous facilities in 
the chemical and metals industries... 
  Danilov-Danilyan: Yes, these are indeed extremely 
hazardous things. For example, chemical plants in Dzerzhinsk, or 
Aramas-16, also located in Nizhegorod Oblast, where nuclear 
warheads are being disassembled under conditions that are, quite 
frankly, not 100 percent adequate. There are plenty of problems, 
but I want to reiterate that the most dangerous areas are being 
monitored with particular vigilance by the Russian agencies for 
the oversight of atomic and industrial safety and our own 
agencies. In contrast to 1986, when the Chernobyl disaster 
occurred under circumstances of completely idiotic complacency, 
now we are already on our guard. 
  Bayduzhiy: What is your assessment of the current 
``green'' movement in this country? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: It is extremely weak and 
divided. Often there are several groups active in each local 
area, competing with one another, and each of them taken 
individually is very insignificant. I would say that the most 
solid environmental organization is the Volga parliament called 
``Revival of the Volga'' [Vozrozhdeniye Volgi]. But once again, 
the committee to save the Rhine in Germany was much stronger at 
the time when the Rhine was in the same condition that the Volga 
is today. Therefore this is all relative. It is very regrettable 
that many ``green'' groups and movements actually have purely 
commercial objectives, attempting to use environmental slogans 
as a means of attracting sponsor aid from abroad. Worse, for 
some of them this has become something of a lifestyle. A 
significant number of environmental groups are also notable for 
their very nihilistic attitude toward the law. The classic 
example of that is Greenpeace, which has chosen provocation of 
the authorities as its method of action. It is deliberately 
oriented toward confrontation. That organization often chooses 
its priorities very incorrectly, making a big deal out of 
insignificant events while overlooking real environmental 
damage. Aleksey Yablokov, the president's advisor on 
environmental affairs, recently put forward the idea that 
environmental goals are not the only reason behind that, and 
that Greenpeace's funding does not just come from members' 
contributions. I became convinced of that a long time ago. 
Greenpeace is backed by the very specific economic interests of 
structures that are not at all difficult to discern if one takes 
a close look at its activities. 
  Bayduzhiy: Some experts, among them the 
aforementioned Aleksey Yablokov, feel that the ministry you head 
has not proven able to withstand the bureaucratic pressure 
exerted on it by various other ministries and agencies. One 
example cited is that the Ministry of Environmental Protection 
and Natural Resources expressed support for a nuclear power 
development program without requiring an environmental impact 
assessment... 
  Danilov-Danilyan: Those who are of that opinion 
would like for the Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources to behave the same way the ``greens'' do at 
their rallies. We are a state organ and must operate in 
accordance with existing laws, whether those laws be good or 
bad. The ministry may take the initiative in regard to changing 
a law, but under no circumstances may it violate the law. We 
cannot demand that nuclear power stations be shut down and 
atomic industry be eliminated merely because they are atomic. If 
you will take a look at the minutes of that same government 
session which considered the aforementioned program, you will 
see that it was I and I alone who insisted that the decision 
include a requirement that environmental impact assessments be 
done on future projects. I regard as unacceptable the position 
of complete rejection of this program as taken by Mr. 
Yablokov--each year we have dozens of disasters in rail 
transportation, so why not shut down the railroads as well? 
Another problem lies in the fact that, as I have noted, under 
the law not every document may be subjected to environmental 
impact assessment, and a government decree is one such document. 
This decree does not contain any specific projects that experts 
could study from an ecological standpoint. Technical oversight 
of nuclear power plants comes under the jurisdiction of Russian 
Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, which has 
been very active of late. Funding for this decree was not 
released, only envisioned -- in the event of a positive 
environmental impact statement. 
  Bayduzhiy: But have there been cases in which you 
have had to give in and make concessions? In other words, have 
you lost the fight with various ministries and agencies? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: There has not been a single 
fundamental issue on which either I or the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources have yet suffered 
a defeat. Yes, there have been difficult situations, but we have 
managed to defend successfully all the most important points 
upon which the environmental protection system in Russia is 
currently based. 
  Bayduzhiy: What is the future of the 
``Komsomolets?'' 
  Danilov-Danilyan: A plan has been created to 
render the submarine harmless there on the sea floor. That plan 
will soon be submitted for environmental impact assessment, and 
the assessment will be a serious one. We currently have two 
forms of environmental assessment -- single-stage and two-stage. 
In the former case all that is needed is a finding by a 
commission of experts. In the latter case, when a project is 
particularly complex and ambiguous, as was the case with the 
Northern Heat and Electric Power Station, for example, the plan 
is also reviewed by the Council for State Environmental 
Assessment. So before anything is done with the ``Komsomolets'' 
each step will be strictly checked out and planned out. 
  Bayduzhiy: You were elected to the State Duma on 
the Russia's Choice slate of candidates. Why exactly did you 
choose that association and not, for instance, Cedar, which has 
made environmental demands the core of its platform? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: My economic views coincide with 
the concept of Russia's Choice, which has also expressed an 
interest in developing its own strong environmental platform, 
and I decided that there would be something for me to do in that 
bloc... In my opinion the accusations of conflict of interest 
that people are so fond of repeating will not stand up to 
criticism. In a majority of developed countries it is the rule 
rather than the exception for ministers to also serve as 
deputies in parliament. Due to the nature of my job I have to 
meet with many heads of foreign environmental protection 
agencies. For instance, in the FRG, the Netherlands, Denmark, 
Norway, France, Finland and Italy (where there have been four 
different ministers of environmental protection in the past two 
years) the ministers of environmental protection are all members 
of parliament. That is quite logical: ministers, even ministers 
of environmental protection, are political figures, and when one 
of them does not get into parliament that is seen as a scandal. 
As for Cedar, according to my observations the backbone of that 
movement is comprised of businessmen who have adopted 
environmental slogans just to win seats in the Duma. I could 
only find one respected ecologist in their entire slate of 
candidates. It is not surprising that in the acronym for Cedar 
[Kedr] the word ``ecology'' [ekologiya] was transformed into 
``yekologiya.'' 
  Bayduzhiy: Which current environmental issue do 
you regard as the most important to Russia? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: The prevailing opinion that our 
present sad environmental state is due to Russia's economic 
problems is only partially correct. Paradoxical as it may seem, 
our main environmental problems are still beyond the grasp of 
our public consciousness. The birth of a single child in a 
post-industrial country creates an environmental burden 300 
times greater than the birth of a child in a developing country. 
When asked when India could equal Great Britain's level, Mahatma 
Gandhi replied: ``In order to achieve its prosperity Britain has 
consumed the resources of half the planet. How many planets 
would it take for a country like India to achieve that level?'' 
And so the main environmental issue is human beings' 
reassessment of the entire system of values by which they live. 
And that it is not a timely issue for Russia alone.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report in ``Inform'' roundup: ``Saratov </F>
Emirates''] 
  [Text] A kerosene vein occupying 459 hectares northeast of 
the city of Engels in Saratov Oblast has been discovered near a 
military airfield. Around 467,000 tonnes of petroleum products 
have leaked out of the airbase, and the ``deposit'' lies at a 
depth of seven meters, with individual lenses of pure kerosene 
between three and five meters thick. 
  The contaminated area lies not far from the bank of the 
Volgograd reservoir and is only 500 meters from the Engels city 
water supply. Over 20 years around 60 tonnes of rocket fuel 
have also been lost from the fuels and lubricants depot. 
  The damage to the environment, according to the preliminary 
figures, is assessed at 24.5 billion rubles. Meanwhile, 
kerosene ``prospectors'' are wasting no time: Each morning they 
drive up and fill their tanks for free. One truckful of illicit 
fuel earns at least 1 million rubles.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report in ``From Our Correspondents and News </F>
Agencies'' column: ``Japan Helps Diagnosis at Russia's Atomic 
Power Stations''] 
  [Text] Russian and Japanese specialists have started 
installing a Japanese acoustic device for the detection of 
radiation leaks from nuclear power units at the Leningrad 
nuclear electric power station, which is fitted with 
(Chernobyl-type) RBMK-1000 [high-power pressure-tube] reactors. 
  The piece of equipment, worth more than $900,000, has been 
supplied by the Japanese side as part of the Russian-Japanese 
Intergovernmental Agreement on Cooperation on Safety in the 
Nuclear Power Industry, signed in 1993. According to the 
Japanese experts taking part in installing the equipment, if the 
cooperation is successful the two countries' specialists propose 
to set up within the next two to three years a uniform 
integrated diagnostic system for this type of reactor and to 
equip another two Russian nuclear power stations with it.

  [Text] [110735] [Peslyak over video of Japanese, 
Moscow street scenes, Vladivostok harbor including warships and 
port installations] We are very grateful to Japan for its 
offer to cooperate in nuclear ecology, I was told by a ranking 
official of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Unfortunately, the 
inspection of a Japanese tanker has revealed that it cannot be 
used to store liquid nuclear waste safely. And secondly, we 
fill up one tanker, and then what? So the main burden will have 
to be borne by our own resources. A Russian vessel, the 
``Pinega,'' which can take 1,000 cubic meters of liquid waste, 
has been found in the Vladivostok area. There is also a system 
for processing this waste. Allow me to remind you that 
``Vesti'' has already reported on our technologies for 
processing liquid waste from nuclear-powered vessels in the 
North. Now a similar enterprise is being built in the Far East. 
Thanks to Japanese credit, it has to be admitted. Coping with 
nuclear waste single-handedly is expensive and difficult. We 
were told at the Foreign Ministry that in the spring a Russian 
research vessel, together with Japanese and South Korean 
experts, will be studying possible dumping grounds for solid 
nuclear waste in the depths of the Pacific. This means that 
clean, economical, and long-term solutions to dirty problems can 
be found by pooling efforts. [110842] [video shows

<F P=106> [Aleksey Tarasov article: ``Krasnoyarsk-26 Threatens Global </F>
Disaster''] 
  [Text] Krasnoyarsk -- The legacy of the Cold War will not 
allow Russians to live in peace for some time to come. Quite 
recently, in 1992, progressive public opinion as a whole 
rejoiced at the closure of two industrial reactors located in 
the secret underground complex at Krasnoyarsk-26 that produced 
weapons-grade plutonium, the substance used to fill nuclear 
warheads. This event really was something to be pleased about. 
However, unresolved problems connected with radiochemical 
production and the territories contaminated by this nuclear 
production were swept under the carpet; these problems are now 
making themselves felt with increasing frequency. What is to be 
done with the accumulated plutonium and radioactive waste? And 
finally, what is to be done with the thousands of people who 
forged the nuclear shield? This entire cluster of problems has 
come to the fore in the closed city of Krasnoyarsk-26. 
<H5>  Time Bomb </H5>
  Environmental catastrophe is the natural result of the work 
carried out by the Krasnoyarsk nuclear scientists. The true 
scale of the environmental contamination is only now becoming 
apparent. For almost 30 years liquid radioactive waste from 
military production has been pumped underground -- into the 
aquiferous sand and clay strata beneath the ``Severnyy'' 
installation. Radioactive waste is still being pumped today. 
  According to data published openly in the press, the 
underground reservoir has received millions of cubic meters of 
radioactive waste with a total radioactivity level of hundreds 
of millions of curies. On the basis of its design parameters, 
this reservoir is now full to capacity. The underground 
reservoirs are infinitely expandable. Nevertheless, if an 
additional RT-2 plant is then built to reclaim the spent nuclear 
fuel, it seems likely that ``Severnyy'' will have to accept 
tritium. 
  This installation is unique in many ways. In the opinion of 
specialists, it is the only storage facility in the world that 
operates a dual system of injection and discharge wells. As 
radioactive waste is pumped in, underground stratal water is 
drawn off. These processes deep underground are monitored via a 
system of observation wells. 
  The site of the installation is also extremely interesting 
-- 
it is located in the Yenisey valley (the distance between the 
river channel and the edge of the installation is 750 meters) on 
a high terrace (100 meters above the level of water in the 
river). Experts are extremely skeptical about the impermeability 
of the screen designed to stop the radioactive waste from moving 
toward the river. And, generally speaking, ``tongues'' of 
waste, judging from geological maps of the area, can travel 
unpredictably large distances. 
  But that is not all. The installation is located in an 
extremely unfavorable site in geological-tectonic terms. 
Hydrogeologist A. Goryunov has the following to say: 
```Severnyy's' location is unique. The fact is that in zones 
where there are regional faults, the various elements of the 
earth's crust are arranged in blocks, so to speak, and this 
basically cannot ensure safe, long-term storage of nuclear 
waste. Moreover, world experience demonstrates that in 
geotectonic conditions such as these, there is an increased risk 
of seismic activity.... These processes are unpredictable. The 
installation poses a potential contaminatory threat to the 
Yenisey and the waters of the Arctic Ocean. Accidents connected 
with leakage of radioactive waste are possible and could be 
described as serious and global in their implications.'' 
  Liquid industrial waste is conveyed to the installation via 
a 
15km-long pipeline. According to V. Savelyev, director of the 
chemical isotope plant, no cases of radioactive waste leaking to 
the surface have been noted throughout the period the plant has 
been operating. 
  Meanwhile, last fall a public environmental-technical expert 
study of the installation began. A preliminary conclusion on 
the results of the investigation into the radiological condition 
of the soil along the course of the pipeline has already been 
prepared within the framework of this study. The results have 
been described as ``conflicting.'' 
  Your IZVESTIYA correspondent has met with V. Chechetkin, 
leader of the field investigation and director of the regional 
center for radioecological studies. According to him, two major 
areas of radioactive contamination and eight localized spots 
have been discovered. At the same time, a contaminated sector 
of the Yenisey floodplain not far from the river bank is causing 
particular alarm. The streams and gullies located in this 
region, and also the surface washout, create favorable 
conditions for the migration of radioisotopes into the general 
water system. The nature of the contamination leads us to 
suppose that it may be due to ``seepages'' [prolivy] of liquid 
radioactive waste. 
  Chechetkin also indicates that the site of the installation 
on the side adjacent to the village of Bolshoy Balchug is 
unguarded. There are specially-built wells that anyone can use 
located at intervals of 100-150 meters. There are also 
organizations not directly involved in nuclear production 
located in the vicinity of the pipeline. All these constitute 
additional risk factors. 
  On the whole, it is obvious to the independent investigators 
of ``Severnyy'' that it should stop operating. More up-to-date 
methods should be used to recycle radioactive waste. 
<H5>  Yenisey's Nuclear Spoor </H5>
  In a climate of absolute secrecy, the lucid minds of the 
Soviet defense industry have been destroying the mighty Yenisey 
for over 30 years. Water from the great river -- the ``hub of 
Russia'' -- was cleansed of suspended particles and used to cool 
the radioactive parts of nuclear reactors, after which it was 
returned to the Yenisey. 
  Recently a number of expeditions have studied the state of 
the river. Radioactive contamination of the Yenisey floodplain 
can be traced from the point where waste has been discharged 
along the course of the river to the Yenisey Gulf; the 
contamination occurs in patches. Plutonium-238 and -239, 
cobalt-60, cesium-134 and -137, strontium-90, and other isotopes 
have all been found in riverbed sediment, algae, sections of 
river bank washed by floodwater, shoals, sandbars, and islands. 
Fish containing man-made [tekhnogennyy] radionuclides have been 
found both downstream of Krasnoyarsk-26 -- at distances of many 
hundreds of miles -- and upstream, in the vicinity of Greater 
Krasnoyarsk. The investigators caught one fish which positively 
``glowed'' at 580 microcuries per hour. 
  The plutonium content of the soil in some areas of the 
floodplain is tens of times higher than the total level of 
contamination. According to data presented by specialists from 
the Applied Geophysics Institute and the Krasnoyarsk Scientific 
Center of the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, the concentration of plutonium in riverbed sediment 
and this sort of soil is so large that chance wind-borne 
transfer of contaminated earth and inhalation of the dust by a 
human being would be equivalent to the maximum permitted annual 
intake of plutonium into the human organism. 
  The decades of the Cold War have poisoned this mighty river 
for a long time to come: Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 
24,000 years, and according to scientists, it remains dangerous 
for 10 times the length of this half-life, that is to say for 
240,000 years. 
  It makes no sense to blame anybody for the madness that has 
occurred. But it is hard to understand why the tradition of 
secrecy is being maintained to this day. Even now it is unclear 
how many curies of long-life radionuclides the combine has 
discharged into the environment. Information about plutonium 
contamination of the air, soil, and water remains confidential, 
despite the fact that data has been published in the United 
States showing how many tonnes of this deadly substance was 
produced by the combine, despite the fact that Siberian 
ecologists know these figures, and despite the existence of 
calculations about the possible amount of plutonium lost during 
production.... The nuclear scientists are refusing to release 
essential documents to the ecologists who are currently studying 
the state of ``Severnyy.'' 
  People should know what conditions they are living in, they 
are entitled to know where and where not to gather berries, go 
fishing, and graze cattle. The most dangerous areas should be 
marked and fenced off. At the very least, we should try to 
eliminate radioactive contamination from areas along the river 
bank and close to settlements. But most important of all, 
research work is currently being carried out and amendments are 
being made to the project to build the RT-2 plant at 
Krasnoyarsk-26. It seems that for the Ministry of Atomic Energy 
and Krasnoyarsk's nuclear scientists, the question of whether or 
not to go ahead with construction is not even on the agenda. 
Apart from their natural desire to preserve their cadres, no 
other arguments are basically being advanced.

  [Text] [Shesterkina voice over video of truck 
emerging from reprocessing plant] The Russian Ministry of 
Atomic Energy, having examined the results of the operation and 
the state of all units of the complex for the vitrification of 
radioactive waste at the Mayak chemical combine, has authorized 
its continued operation. This furnace is the only one on the 
territory of the former USSR and the most efficient in the 
world, although this work is also done by Britain and France. 
Here industrial-grade plutonium for nuclear electric power 
stations is extracted from reprocessed nuclear fuel and the 
radioactive waste is vitrified and placed in storehouses. 
Beneath me are about 150 million curies of radioactivity 
rendered harmless from nuclear fuel used not only in Russia but 
also in Armenia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, 
and Finland. It is all too obvious that, having our own nuclear 
electric power stations, an inconceivable number of missiles, 
icebreakers, and submarines, we have accumulated such a quantity 
of weapons-grade and industrial-grade plutonium, whose decay 
takes 24,000 years, that we are doomed to conducting our own 
reprocessing. [video shows exterior, interior of

<F P=106> [Interview with N. Sakharnykh, chairman of the Kaliningrad </F>
Oblast Ecology and Natural Resources Committee, by S. Tribunko; 
place and date not given: ``Ground -- for Dessert to Mother 
Nature''] 
  [Excerpts] 
  Tribunko: How serious is the ecological situation 
in Chernyakhovskiy rayon? 
  Sakharnykh: The situation is very grave. The 
city's water-supply and sewage enterprise is the main polluter. 
This enterprise yearly discharges more than 6 million cubic 
meters of untreated sewage into water reservoirs, causing 2 
billion rubles [R] worth of damage in 1993 alone. 
  In 1993, the maximum acceptable level of nitrous ammonia in 
water exceeded the norm by 71 times, that of phosphorus -- by 37 
times, and of oil products -- by 100 to 300 times. 
  Tribunko: One gets the impression that there are 
no sewage treatment plants in the rayon. 
  Sakharnykh: Such plants exist, but their number is 
insufficient. For example, out of 11 treatment plants not a 
single one functions in accordance with its planned operating 
schedule. Only four plants provide the mechanical treatment of 
sewage, while the remaining seven provide no treatment at all. 
The situation is aggravated by all kinds of accidents at city 
enterprises. 
  Tribunko: Could you cite any examples? 
  Sakharnykh: I will only cite the most serious 
ones. In 1993, the engine house discharged more than a tonne of 
oil products into the Angrapa river, causing damage estimated at 
more than a R1 million. There were similar accidents 
accompanied by discharging industrial oil at joint-stock 
enterprises ``Molochnyy Zavod,'' ``Chernyakhovskmebel,'' and 
``Tekhmash.'' On 12 January, an industrial oil spill occurred 
at ``Tekhmash'' through negligence. [passage omitted] 
  Tribunko: I would like to know your opinion 
regarding the building of the facility for processing toxic 
waste. 
  Sakharnykh: This is not a bad idea. If everything 
goes according to plan, and all the technological requirements 
are observed, the functioning of the facility will not aggravate 
the ecological situation in the region. However, we cannot 
disregard the notorious ``what if'' factor which can bring about 
big trouble, including deaths. 
  Besides, I do not understand the haste with which this idea 
is being implemented. Geologic research has not been completed, 
there has been no independent experts' evaluation of the 
project, nor its technical and economic justification. Thus, I 
believe that it is too early to speak about the facility at this 
point.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>
  [Text] Vladivostok January 28 TASS -- A top official of the 
Russian Pacific Navy accused Japanase mass media of ``whipping 
up tensions'' over the waste dumping problem. 
  ``Our neighbours in the Sea of Japan, as well as other 
countries which have nuclear power-engineering, also dump 
low-radioactive waste in coastal waters. This is world practice 
and nobody, but Japan, makes so much ado about it,'' Valeriy 
Danilyan, head of the chemical service of the Pacific Fleet, 
told TASS on Friday. 
  This ``ado'' forced a tanker from the Pacific Fleet with 
nuclear waste on board to dock in the Bolshoy Kamen Bay where it 
will have to stay until spring. 
  In order to help the Pacific Fleet to cope with the 
situation, Japan offered its own tanker to be used for storing 
radioactive waste. 
  It is hard to say whether this was just a hasty decision or 
an underestimation of the experience of Russian navymen, 
according to Danilyan. 
  The Japanese tanker was worn out by 30 percent, it had no 
necessary double coating and no pumping system to load and 
unload the waste, he explained. 
  Besides, it could not solidify liquid waste and the Pacific 
Fleet had to turn down the Japanese offer. 
  Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Feliks Gromov told reporters 
during a recent visit to Vladivostok that 20 hours after dumping 
the level of radioactivity does not exceed the natural 
background in the Sea of Japan. He added that Russia is now 
designing an ecologically-safe technology to utilise radioactive 
waste.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alyaksandr Alfonsavich Matsyasovich, head of </F>
the Information and Public Relations Department within the State 
Committee for Ecological Issues, by Alyaksandr Hyerasimaw; place 
and date not given: ``Nature Cannot Wait'' -- first paragraph is 
CHYRVONAYA ZMENA introduction] 
  [Text] Within our everyday problems and sore issues, we do 
not notice the situation in which our environment has found 
itself lately. Sometimes, nature surrounding us can cause us -- 
tired and nervous with everyday complexities -- to become wild, 
and then we claim that protection of nature is not our affair. 
Our correspondent queried Alyaksandr Matsyasovich, head of the 
Information and Public Relations Department within the State 
Committee for Ecological Issues, on the pressing ecology issues 
in Belarus. 
  Matsyasovich: At the start, I would like to note 
that our Republic is characterized by an irrational use of 
natural resources. Before, we connected this fact with 
domineering economic relations: Energy and natural resources had 
to be used most effectively and no one was interested in the 
effectiveness of production [as published]. Low quality 
production brought about a lot of waste which was not processed. 
For example, yearly, around 4.5 tonnes of domestic and 
industrial waste (per capita!) is being produced in Belarus. 
Only two enterprises in Belarus -- in Minsk and Mogilev -- are 
dealing with the partial processing of waste. A powerful Minsk 
factory is processing barely 30 percent of this waste. The 
unprocessed waste is being dumped. Officially, our dumps occupy 
an area of more than 10,000 hectares. However, no one has ever 
calculated the area occupied by unofficial dumps.... 
  A second problem is the large-scale intrusion into nature. 
Many types of plants, animals, and insects have disappeared. 
  We are currently living in a situation where former wet 
regions of Polesye are suffering from lack of water, especially, 
in Gomel Oblast. 
  Hyerasimaw: Alyaksandr Alfonsavich, could you 
please remind us what natural resources we are rich in and how 
we are using them? 
  Matsyasovich: First, our water resources. Almost 
all our cities have more or less effective purifying stations. 
However, purifying stations in some of our regions are 
overloaded and overutilized. Minsk purifying stations are in 
the latter category. 
  We cannot drink water from our rivers. Due to the improper 
use of fertilizers and insecticides, the agricultural sector of 
Belarus presents the greatest danger to our rivers. However, it 
is because of the improper behavior of people that nature 
suffers most of all. The main polluter of our rivers is ... oil! 
If in southern Belarus -- where oil lies close to the surface 
-- the outer surface is polluted due to the oil's outlet to the 
surface, the oil pollution of our remaining areas is caused by 
the improper use of oil resources. 
  Our water purity records usually exceed normal levels from 
one- two to 40 points, like in Soligorsk. Verkhnedvinskiy, 
Nesvizhskiy Rayons, and some rayons of Brest and Grodno Oblasts 
suffer from a high level of water pollution as well. 
  Further, some 3 million tonnes of polluted substances are 
discharged in the air. This equals the amount of toxic 
substances polluting the air of Zaporozhie and Krivoy Rog taken 
together. Maybe this is not much, but Belarus, located in a 
specific geographical zone, is to a greater extent polluted by 
transferred air masses from other territories. If we are to 
believe West European experts, the Belarusian atmosphere is 
polluted in 18-20 percent by its own sources and in 80-82 
percent -- by someone else's. 
  From all the Belarusian cities, Novopolotsk is in an 
extremely serious ecological situation. However, in 1993, air 
pollution in Novopolotsk was decreased by 22 percent. This 
time, it is connected not to the upgrading of the production 
capacity, but to the fall of the economy. 
  The Kuybyshev factory in Mogilev is very harmful from an 
ecological standpoint. To my regret, we cannot do anything to 
improve the situation because this factory is located in the 
center of the city. We cannot move people, or this enterprise, 
or close this dangerous giant producing one of the most 
poisonous chemical substances. In addition, there is not enough 
room to build effective purifying stations. 
  Many years ago, Belarus signed a range of international 
agreements, one of which stipulates specific amounts of nitrogen 
oxides discharged into the air. These agreements hamper the 
development of our power industry. These agreements do not 
allow operating the new electric power plant No. 5 which was 
built in Minsk. At the same time, the Republic badly needs 
electric energy. We cannot afford to buy a good purifying 
installation from Japan or Germany. Power engineering in 
Belarus is going to ask the international community for 
permission to temporarily sidestep the above-mentioned 
agreements until the Republic stabilizes the work of power 
engineering. Recently, Portugal has received such permission. 
By the way, Portugal, Poland, Rumania, and Malta are leading 
polluters in the world. 
  Hyerasimaw: Our Republic should have an effective 
legal footing and appropriate state institutions and 
organizations to resolve ecology issues. Are we moving forward 
in this direction? 
  Matsyasovich: First of all, responsibility for the 
protection of nature should be carried out by environmental 
users themselves. We have the ``Law on Nature Protection.'' 
Therefore, any enterprise, including small ones, should keep to 
existing norms. It is difficult because they lack proper 
technologies and purifying equipment. Our State Committee for 
Ecological Issues controls the implementation of ecological 
laws. Violation of these laws brings about financial and 
administrative penalties. We can even close enterprises that 
violate these laws. Yes, this issue is not properly organized 
in our Republic. In my opinion, hereditary factors of the old 
administrative system still affect our actions. 
  [Matsyasovich continues] Anyway, we could improve 
the entire ecological situation, especially our specific 
institutions dealing with Chernobyl issues and following their 
own programs. We require perspective, and a scientifically 
grounded ecological policy. We require systematic monitoring, 
scientific vision, etc. We have a relatively high research 
potential. Already in the 1970's, Belarusian researchers 
conducted a scientific prognosis for the next 20 years, and they 
had prognosticated much of what we are experiencing today. 
However, nobody wanted to listen to them then. We have 
interesting research projects. It is essential to find such 
economic levers that could make our producers use natural 
resources rationally. It sounds incredible, but our legislation 
has no notion of the so-called ``ecological crime.'' Following 
is one of many examples. In Novopolotsk, around 90,000 tonnes 
of high toxic substances have been spilled into the Dvina river. 
Later, they reached the Baltic Sea and caused the death of 
fish. The operator and the security engineer were tried for 
violation of security rules but not for any serious ``ecological 
crime.'' 
  Violators of ecological laws are fined for polluting water 
or 
for poaching. So, what about the land and air? Currently, an 
ecological code of laws including 16 laws is being drafted. We 
have adopted the ``Law on the Protection of the Environment,'' 
``On Ecological Examination,'' ``On Ecological Taxation,'' ``On 
Waste.'' The laws ``On Protected Territories,'' ``On 
Ecological Education,'' and ``On Regulation of the State Control 
System'' are being drafted. 
  We should create a single system of state control. Just at 
the moment, the state control system is split. The State 
Committee for Protection of the Environment, the State Committee 
for Land Reform, the Ministry of Forestry controlling the use 
and protection of forests, the Chief Department of Belarusian 
Fish Industry, the Chief Committee for Water, Meteorology 
[Belhidramet], and various sanitary services do not cooperate. 
None of these institutions has enough powers. 
  We should also speak about the examination of projects by 
state experts, the system for the ecological education of 
experts, the ecological culture of the population, and the use 
of international experience. 
  Hyerasimaw: Yes, there are a lot of problems. 
However, can we hope that they will be resolved? 
  Matsyasovich: In my opinion, we will be able to 
resolve them. In the spring of 1993, the Belarusian Cabinet of 
Ministers adopted a decree stipulating the upgrading of the 
monitoring system. This decree will be implemented in 1994-95. 
The decree on the introduction of regular land surveys has also 
been adopted. This means that the use of all natural resources 
will be strictly controlled, and the natural resources will be 
subject to normative use. If we consider forestry, I can say 
the following. The corresponding laws that had been adopted are 
being currently implemented in this sphere. Felling does not 
exceed the growth of forests. You know, after the 1941-45 war, 
the greatest part of our forests was destroyed. Only 2.5 
percent of the mature forest is left. Currently, a third of 
Belarus is covered by forests. In other words, the program of 
use and restoration of forests is being implemented. First of 
all, we require a protection system for all our natural 
resources. Of course, if new laws are adopted they will be 
implemented and we will make progress. 
  Hyerasimaw: I wish you success. Thank you for the 
interview.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``In the Republic of Georgia Cabinet </F>
of Ministers. On the Creation of a Single State System To 
Monitor the Republic of Georgia Environment''] 
  [Text] By a decree of the Republic of Georgia Cabinet of 
Ministers, a single state system to monitor the Republic of 
Georgia environment has been created; it will observe and assess 
the state of the environment and make forecasts. 
  The creation of a single state system for ecological 
monitoring in the Republic of Georgia will make it possible to 
improve the administration of the ecological situation in 
Georgia and its operational control. Great importance is 
attached to its successful implementation from the point of view 
of the resolution of other problems connected with the national 
economy. 
  The Ministry for the Protection of the Environment has been 
entrusted with organizing a single state system to monitor the 
republic's environment and elaborating a program for 
implementing it in the republic. 
  The republic's academies of science and agriculture and a 
number of ministries, departments, and agencies have been 
entrusted with implementing individual monitoring systems. 
  The Ministry for the Protection of the Environment along 
with 
the Academy of Sciences and interested ministries and 
departments are to present within two months to the Republic of 
Georgia Cabinet of Ministers proposals for the creation of an 
interdepartmental council in the Ministry for the Protection of 
the Environment that will elaborate a program for creating a 
single state system to monitor the republic's environment. 
  On the basis of the radiation control group in the 
``Sakmtavarhidrometi'' republican center for monitoring the 
environment, the Ministry for the Protection of the Environment 
should create a service for controlling radiation safety in the 
republic by the end of January 1994. 
  A single environmental information and research system is to 
be created within the main department of hydrometeorology and 
environmental monitoring, which will unite the departmental 
banks holding statistics on monitoring on the basis of a single 
methodology and in accordance with international standards.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 18, BNS -- Latvia may face problems with 
radioactive waste because of shortfall of store containers, said 
Andrejs Salmins, a nuclear safety specialist at the 
Environmental Protection and Regional Development Ministry. 
  Financial and managing hardships hamper repairs in Latvia's 
sole nuclear waste depot in the Radons enterprise while its 
exisiting storing capacities are exhausted, Salmins said. 
  To solve the problem, the ministry will consult the Finance 
Ministry's experts to calculate the sum needed to finish the 
reconstruction and find a building organization to complete the 
works. 
  The approximate sum is 150,000 lats, but the state budget 
earmarked only 50,000 lats for the enterprise's reconstruction. 
  In addition, the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Inspectorate 
has until Jan. 24 to draft a program for ecological research in 
Radons and its vicinity. 
  The Riga Radioisotopic Research Institute also nears the 
brink of bankruptcy. This institute, like Radons, stores 
radioactive waste. The institutes' scientists are commissioned 
to forward proposals on the use and storage of radioactive 
substances. They should also determine which substances to keep 
and which to sell. 
  The National Environmental and Social Health Center will 
compile a resolution on work with radioactive waste and prepare 
a program for monitoring the residents' health in Radons' 
vicinity.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 10, BNS -- The Latvian Environmental 
Protection and Regional Development Ministry established 
successful contacts last year with Denmark and Sweden in waste 
processing and sewage treatment, spokesman Zigfrids Bruvers told 
BNS. 
  Denmark sponsored the Riga city waste processing scheme that 
also provides for sorting of nonindustrial waste. Latvia used 
Danish funding to assess the quantity of toxic waste in the 
country, Bruvers said. 
  Sweden allotted 108 million kronor to build sewage 
processors 
in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. From this, 5 million kronor 
were extended to the Riga municipal water supply and sewerage 
enterprise. 
  Another part of the Swedish Government assignation, around 
40 
million kronor, is needed to reconstruct the Liepaja city 
sewerage. Currently, Liepaja is one of the main polluters of 
Latvian waters in the Baltic Sea. 
  Another 9-million-U.S.-dollar project targets introduction 
of 
efficient and environmentally friendly heating systems in 
Latvia's small towns. The plan is based on transforming regional 
heating systems on local raw materials, like wood or peat. 
  From the project's expenses, 1 million dollars are donated 
by 
the Danish Government, the rest is the Danish Government's loan 
to Latvia. The term of the credit is 10 years, Denmark wants no 
interest from the sum. The Latvian Government, however, still 
has to extend its guarantees to insure the credit. 
  In addition, the Latvian Valmiera district and the Danish 
Velje district environmentalists started to jointly monitor the 
river basins in the Valmiera vicinity, said Bruvers. The Velje 
authorities also presented Latvia with a sea monitoring ship.

  [Text] Riga, Jan 25, BNS -- The Latvian Dangerous Waste and 
Toxic Substances Inspectorate passed the Environmental 
Protection and Regional Development Ministry a package of 
amendments to the 1993 law on toxic waste, Chief Inspector 
Andris Roska told BNS. 
  Enterprises that work with dangerous waste should register 
themselves at local governments to get licenses for its use and 
transportation, under the amendments. 
  The inspectorate established businesslike cooperation with 
the Customs Department, which is provided with the list of 
dangerous substances, Roska said. Customs officers also inform 
regional inspectors on any suspicious cargos, he said. 
  Customs officers together with the regional inspector, for 
example, recently detained 15 railway containers with phenolic 
waste, which the Belarus-based Ruta firm was sending to its 
Latvian partner Service SPB. 
  Roska said that Service SPB must have planned to sell the 
waste as cheap heating fuel. When burnt, phenolic waste 
produces toxic foul-smelling fumes that are harmful to nature 
and people's health. 
  The Basel convention also forbids interstate transportation 
of phenolic waste, Roska said. The cargo was returned to 
Belarus 6 January.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Bricag, chief specialist of the State </F>
Department for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources: 
``The Ecology. Who Is Supporting Us in International Cooperation 
for Protection of Nature''] 
  [Text] One of the priority areas of the foreign 
policy of the Republic of Moldova is international cooperation 
in the area of environmental protection. Moldova is joining in 
the activity of international environmental protection 
organizations and is participating in the implementation of the 
corresponding conventions and agreements. To do this, an 
Administration of International and Social Relations has been 
created under the State Department for Environmental Protection 
and Natural Resources, and under the National Institute of 
Ecology--a Bureau of International Programs and Projects. The 
solutions to problems of international cooperation of the 
Republic of Moldova in the area of environmental protection is 
discussed by a chief specialist of the State Department for 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, Valeriy 
Bricag. 
  The concrete results of the state department's international 
activity were the ratification by the parliament of the Republic 
of Moldova of the Biodiversity Convention and the endorsement of 
such important documents as the World Charter on Nature, the 
Convention on Crossborder Impact of Industrial Accidents, and 
the Convention on Protecting the Animal Kingdom and the Natural 
Environment in Europe. Moreover, in July 1993 the parliament 
adopted a decree on the creation of a National Autonomous Center 
of the Republic of Moldova in the International System of 
Information on the Environment (INFOTERRA), which gave us access 
to the World Environmental Data Bank. 
  It should be noted that in international cooperation in the 
area of environmental protection, preference should be given to 
concluding bilateral and regional agreements at the state level. 
The endorsement of international conventions should take into 
account, on the one hand, the republic's financial and technical 
capabilities and, on the other, the interests of the state and 
the world community. Both state and nonstate organizations can 
enter international environmental protection organizations. 
Cooperation with international funds, organizations, scientific 
centers, and financial structures should include primarily the 
development and implementation of national ecological projects. 
  As early as 1990, the State Department for Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources came out with an initiative to 
conclude agreements at the level of environmental protection 
organs of the Union republics. This activity has been 
continued--draft agreements have been sent to all the 
independent states of the former USSR. But not all of them have 
shown a readiness to cooperate at this level. Only the first 
protocol has been signed between the State Department for 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of the Republic 
of Moldova and the Ministry of Environmental Protection of 
Ukraine. 
  The Interstate Ecological Council (MES), which anticipates 
cooperation among the CIS countries, was formed in February 
1992. But the Republic of Moldova did not sign the document to 
enter the MES. Moldova has not been represented at a single 
session of the MES. But a department worker participated in the 
work of the group of experts for preparing for the first session 
of the MES, and another one participated as an observer in the 
work of the first meeting of the Coordination Group under the 
MES for cooperation with UNEP [United Nations Environment 
Program] and other international organizations. This group was 
formed by a decision of the third MES session, which took place 
in Tashkent in May 1993, and its goal is to coordinate the 
activity of the MES member countries for creating specialized 
organs for cooperation with the UNEP and other international 
organizations, and also for developing and implementing joint 
ecological projects under the aegis of the UNEP. 
  In the former USSR, the role of a specialized organ for 
cooperation with international environmental protection 
organizations, including UNEP and the World Bank, was assigned 
to the Center for International Projects (TsMP) under the Union 
State Committee for the Protection of Nature. The CIS countries 
decided to take advantage of the experience of the TsMP and, on 
its basis, to create a consultative-executive organ of the 
coordinating group under the MES. 
  Thus, the CIS countries developed their own mechanism for 
interstate and international cooperation, but it is too early to 
judge its effectiveness. In October of this year, an official 
appeal was addressed to the chairman of the parliament of the 
Republic of Moldova from the secretariat of the MES, considering 
the entry of the Republic of Moldova into this organization. I 
think we should get rid of our excessive suspicion regarding all 
structures created within the framework of the former USSR. 
  Representatives of Russia are working in many international 
organizations. The Russian lobby is very influential there. This 
could have decisive significance for us--the success of our 
cause will depend on the position of one or another 
representative of an international organization. Joint entry and 
coordination of activity will help incline international 
organizations to support our country. The TsMP is making a 
commitment to render assistance in international support for 
Moldovan ecological projects and is also prepared to help in the 
organization of a similar center in our republic. 
  We are losing a great deal as a result of delay in solving 
these problems, and we are being left out of the picture. Thus, 
the British company Alexander Jib and Company has monopolized 
the right to develop and implement the project for protecting 
the basin of the River Prut, which will enable it to dispose of 
funds allotted by the World Bank. 
  Our relations with Romania are being arranged on the basis 
of 
the Protocol on Cooperation between the State Department for 
Environmental Protection of the Republic of Moldova and the 
Ministry of the Environment of Romania. In keeping with this, a 
Romanian-Moldovan commission was formed for working together in 
the Prut basin. But there has been no marked success in this 
area. Cooperation is limited mainly to unilateral aid from 
Romania. Financial and technical aid has been rendered to the 
Moldsilva Association and the National Institute of Ecology--for 
forestry and radiological research on the territory of Moldova. 
  Following the lines of cooperation within the framework of 
international conventions, we will have to solve difficult 
financial problems. Thus, Moldova has not joined the Geneva 
Conference on Crossborder Air Pollution over Large Areas. The 
reason is the lack of hard currency to subsidize measures within 
the framework of the Convention. As for the Vienna Convention on 
Protection of the Ozone Layer, not joining it has entailed 
serious consequences for our economy. Starting in 1994, 
international sanctions and bans will be introduced on exports 
and imports of freon-emitting items. The corresponding sanctions 
will be applied to countries that have not joined the Washington 
Convention on International Trade in Species of Wild Flora and 
Fauna That Are Threatened With Extinction. 
  In this connection, it must be noted that countries of the 
former USSR have the opportunity to join these conventions by a 
simple confirmation, announcing this to the corresponding 
depository with an official government note. The same thing 
pertains to international organizations of the UN system. And if 
we are still not cooperating with such well-known organizations 
as the UN Environment Program (UNEP), the United Nations 
Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the UN Center for 
Human Population (HABITAT), the World Meteorological 
Organization (WMO), and others, this is because of our 
inefficiency and sometimes simply because of our ignorance of 
the procedures for addressing, joining, and entering them. 
  A center for international programs and projects would help 
to eliminate this information gap and establish permanent 
contacts with dozens of international funds, organizations, and 
centers that would be extremely useful to our country. For 
example, the Regional Center for Environmental Protection in 
Central and Eastern Europe (REK) in 1994 allotted $600,000 in 
financial aid to nongovernmental organizations engaged in the 
development and implementation of environmental protection 
projects. And through the DZhYeF [expansion not given] Fund of 
the World Bank, $208 million is being allotted just for projects 
within the framework of the Convention on Biodiversity. In order 
to participate in these projects, we must either make a request 
for financing our projects or submit an application to enter the 
REK, MSOP, and so on. But here, as they say, we have fallen 
slightly behind. 
  For the sake of clarity, I will give some other facts. Just 
during the past two years, Ukraine has been able to organize the 
participation of its specialists in seminars financed by the 
governments of the United States and Poland, and the World Bank, 
for training specialists in the area of ecological projects and 
programs. The United States, additionally, finances the Center 
for Ecological Education and Information formed in Kiev. Canada 
has allotted to the Ukraine $3 million for a program for saving 
the Dnieper River. The Know-How Fund from England renders the 
Department for the Introduction of International Projects 
consulting aid in the implementation of 13 projects for 
ecological restoration of Ukraine. The World Bank has already 
allotted to the country about $1 million for carrying out 
projects in the Carpathian preserves and the Danube Delta, and 
the European Community is financing the development and 
introduction of a system of monitoring, legislative acts, and 
standards. 
  Summing up what has been said, I must note that the State 
Department for Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of 
the Republic of Moldova has adopted a number of measures to work 
in the main areas in which our country should cooperate in the 
area of environmental protection. Specialists of the state 
department are participating in the implementation of a program 
for protecting the Danube River and a program for ecological 
restoration of the Black Sea basin. Materials are being prepared 
for entry into the International Union for Protection of Nature 
and Natural Resources and the Regional Center for Environmental 
Protection in Central and Eastern Europe. Negotiations are being 
conducted with representatives of international organizations to 
hold the international fair Eco-94 at the beginning of next 
year, and with representatives of the international convention 
for one called the ``Role of Information in Overcoming the 
Ecological Crisis in Countries of the Former Socialist Camp 
During the Period of Transition to a Market Economy.'' Lists of 
international conventions and agreements that are of primary 
significance to Moldova are being systematized and prepared to 
be submitted to parliament.

  [Text] The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office blames 
Vice Prime Minister Vladimir Demyanov for deliberate inflicting 
ecological damage to the republic, Deputy Prosecutor General 
Olga Kolinko told a press conference in Kiev today. She 
described Demyanov's actions as ``illegal and destructive,'' 
referring to his giving Agriculture and Food Minister Yuriy 
Karasik his personal consent to using the American chemical 
``Harness'' in the republican agriculture. 
  She said ``such a connivance allowed the American company 
`Monsanto' to fetch in 2,000 tons of this chemical which is not 
even registered in the U.S.A. and is banned for use in 
Ukraine.'' She also said a criminal case was filed against 
``state officials of the Agriculture and Health Care 
ministries'' on the fact of the acquisition of this chemical and 
production of banned chemicals in Ukraine. 
  In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine, Kolinko said 
``Ukraine 
has become a test site for foreign companies where they test 
their chemicals, and moreover, directly on the fields.'' 
  ``Monsanto'' representative in Kiev, Vladimir Kudryashov, 
told Interfax-Ukraine that ``they did sell some quantity of 
`Harness' to Ukrainian consumers.'' He said ``had the chemical 
not been used last year, Ukraine would not have had such a rich 
harvest of corn.'' At the same time, he added that the 
company's office in Kiev will sell the chemical only after its 
registration in the republic, supposedly this February or March.

  [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in 
Ukrainian at 1955 GMT on 18 January carries the program 
``Nonnuclear Ukraine'' providing scientific and ecological 
justification for the signing of the tripartite 
U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement by President Kravchuk. The 
program is attended by Ukrainian Academy of Sciences chairman 
Borys Paton, unidentified deputy chairman of the same academy, 
Viktor Zelenskyy, manager of the Academy of Sciences Institute 
of Physics, Nur Nigmatullin, first deputy chairman of the 
Nuclear Committee, Mykola Steinberg, chairman of the State 
Committee for Nuclear and Radiation Security, and Leonid Kapkan, 
head of the department at the Institute of Physical-Organic 
Chemistry. 
  Borys Paton opens the program saying that the signing of the 
treaty in Moscow by President Leonid Kravchuk is ``an event with 
a historic meaning long-awaited by mankind.'' He points out 
that the legislature should promptly ratify the agreement, 
because otherwise, Ukraine will face ``political and economic 
hardships.'' Paton underlines that the issue of security 
guarantees for Ukraine has been finally resolved, following a 
long period of ``evading'' this problem by both the United 
States and Russia. Paton believes that readiness to grant 
Ukraine security guarantees facilitated the signing of the 
agreement. He emphasizes that Ukraine has been a merely nominal 
owner of, and has not exercised control over, the nuclear 
missiles deployed on its territory due to lack of necessary 
facilities and qualified personnel. In Paton's opinion, Ukraine 
has scientists, engineers, and military experts capable of 
dismantling the missiles in Ukraine. However, he points out 
that this would take a very long time and entail huge financial 
resources. Thus, the agreement, providing for involvement of 
international funds for the elimination of Ukrainian nuclear 
arms, will enable the elimination of the latter ``with an 
advantage for Ukraine.'' Paton concludes by saying that the 
Academy of Sciences staff positively assesses the signing of the 
agreement by the Ukrainian president and believes that the 
Supreme Council will ratify it. 
  Viktor Zelenskyy enumerates the facilities and equipment 
necessary for launching nuclear missiles which are not available 
in Ukraine. These include tracking stations and tracking 
satellites. Neither does Ukraine have the software and computers 
capable of correcting missiles' flight paths. Thus, ``Ukraine 
has had a gun but has not known how to pull the trigger or where 
the bullet will fly.'' 
  Adding to the discussion, Nur Nigmatullin says that it is 
``practically impossible'' for Ukraine to create its own 
infrastructure for maintaining and servicing the missiles, and 
signing the agreement on eliminating the latter was the only 
sound resolution. 
  Speaking of Ukraine's chances to build its own nuclear arms, 
an unidentified speaker points out that Ukraine is a state with 
highly developed industries. However, to produce nuclear arms 
it would have to train qualified personnel, conduct scientific 
research in the field of splitting the isotopes of uranium-235, 
and build reactors for producing plutonium and tritium. 
Ukraine's scientific potential permits this. A nuclear warhead 
is a very hi-tech product, and Ukraine having no experience in 
this field, would have to establish a design bureau and a 
research institute in the Republic and furnish them with 
equipment. Finally, the process would involve creating entire 
new industries. However, Ukraine's lack of test-ranges would 
still be the main factor precluding the building of nuclear 
weapons in Ukraine. 
  Commenting on ecological aspects of nuclear arms stationing 
in Ukraine, Viktor Zelenskyy points out that the liquid 
propellant in Ukrainian nuclear missiles is ``enough to cover 
half of Ukraine with a 500-meter layer of a highly poisonous 
substance.'' Half of the Ukrainian population would die 
``provided there is no wind or rain.'' Zelenskyy believes that 
President Kravchuk undoubtedly took the ecological aspect into 
account when signing the Moscow agreement. 
  Adding to the discussion, Leonid Kapkan says that the 
maximum 
admissible concentration of the liquid propellant ``heptyl'' in 
the atmosphere is 1/10,000 grams per cubic meter, while 
``hundreds of tonnes'' of the substance are stored in Ukraine. 
He points out that the Institute of Physical-Organic Chemistry, 
aware of the fact that Ukraine is a ``powerful'' spacecraft 
producer has developed a technology permitting the processing of 
heptyl into a harmless salt and, if needed, back into heptyl 
with losses not exceeding 15 percent of the substance. 
According to Leonid Kapkan, the technology developed by the 
Donbass Institute of Agroindustrial Technologies brought about a 
50 percent increase in crops of wheat and barley in test-fields. 
  Answering the moderator's question on what will happen if 
the 
legislature refuses to ratify the Moscow agreement, Mykola 
Steinberg, chairman of the State Committee for Nuclear and 
Radiation Security, says that maintaining and servicing nuclear 
arms is as complicated as producing them. The processes under 
way regarding warheads will make them worthless in the future. 
On the other hand, the expiration of the missiles' warranty 
time period will make them dangerous and extremely expensive to 
dismantle. 
  According to Nur Nigmatullin, nuclear devices of 
Ukrainian-based warheads will be processed into fuel sufficient 
for six to seven years of the 10 Ukrainian reactors' operation. 
Nigmatullin points out that Ukraine will not receive this kind 
of fuel free; the costs will be some 30 percent lower than the 
current ones. Given the dramatic situation in supplies of power 
resources, including nuclear fuel, Ukraine will be able to save 
``the badly needed billions of rubles.'' As a ``future user'' 
of this fuel, Nigmatullin appeals to the legislature to ratify 
the agreement, and assist nuclear power engineering in Ukraine 
that covers 35 percent of the demand for electric power in the 
Republic.

Decontamination Method''] 
  [Text] This method was developed by scientists in Rivne. 
According to Vasyl Hurin, doctor of technological sciences and 
professor at the Ukrainian Water Management Engineers Institute, 
he, jointly with his colleagues, succeeded in developing a 
project that will make it possible to ``bind'' radionuclides 
present in the soil by natural sorbents (available in Rivne 
Oblast). As a result, the harmful elements will not be absorbed 
by plants and will not be consumed, with food, by the people. 
  The Rivne scientists are assisted by the Chernobyl Ministry 
and by corresponding oblast structures. Foreign specialists 
have also shown interest. Eric Nattall, doctor of technical and 
nuclear technologies [qualifications as translated] and New 
Mexico University professor, arrived in Rivne. The American 
expert praised the Rivne project and promised cooperation. 
Local enterprises stated that if the question of implementing 
the project arises, they would be willing to invest in this 
important undertaking.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Kobelnyuk report from Luhansk Oblast and interview </F>
with Anatoliy Savchenko, chief of the water resources department 
at the oblast state administration office for environmental 
protection, and with Lyudmyla Senchynok, associate at the 
``Luhanskheolohiya'' Geological Enterprise department for 
accounting and utilizing subsurface water reserves and studying 
their state: ``A Place in a Barrel With Brine'' -- first 
paragraph published in boldface] 
  [Text] An ecological hangover -- this is a relatively 
recent notion. Lysychansk, Siverskodonetsk, and Rubizhne, which 
constitute the notorious chemical ``Bermuda Triangle,'' also 
suffer the ``morning after the night before'' syndrome. 
However, it is precisely here that there is particularly large 
amount of brine [culinary brine is believed to bring relief 
after heavy drinking]. But this brine is also a consequence of 
the same ecological disaster. 
  Possibly everyone in Ukraine has heard about Lysychansk, 
Siverskodonetsk, or Rubizhne. No wonder, because these are 
towns of great chemistry. What harm has that chemistry done 
there? It turns out that not only has it poisoned the air, 
rivers, and soil, but even permeated the ground down to hundreds 
of meters or even kilometers! The consequences may be extremely 
serious, to the extent that these places may become totally 
deserted. The triangle expands not only horizontally, but 
vertically downward -- this is its horrifying characteristic. 
  During the times of Brezhnev, various commissions came to 
Lysychansk, among them a USSR governmental commission headed by 
[prime minister] A. Kosygin's deputy. Especially to find out 
about the specific qualities of the brine produced in large 
quantities by the local soda plant. Of course, the commissions 
did not do anything specific, but they came. Now they have 
stopped coming. Maybe they know there is not enough money to 
implement potential projects? 
  Thus, since prerevolutionary times, production waste -- 
calcium chloride solutions -- has been discharged by the 
Lysychansk Soda Plant. 
  Savchenko: These solutions don't appear to be so 
terrible. In their composition, they resemble seawater. 
However, there are huge amounts of them. They are stored in 
pits, the walls of which are not impermeable. They percolate 
into the soil and spread through aquifers. Besides that, 
overfilled reservoirs may break unreliable dams and there could 
be a catastrophe. 
  Kobelnyuk: Is it possible to neutralize such 
production waste? 
  Savchenko: Nobody in Europe knows how to do this. 
Such enterprises are located in coastal areas. The waste, as 
it is, is discharged into the water. 
  Kobelnyuk: Is it at least possible to somehow use 
the chlorides? 
  Savchenko: Prior to the disintegration of the 
USSR, the soda producers received some assistance from the 
Northern Fleet. The chlorides were used to prevent the icing 
over of ships. As a result, reservoirs were gradually emptied. 
Today, Russians in the north can do without Lysychansk. 
  Kobelnyuk: What is being done now? 
  Savchenko: Research work is under way. There are 
specific proposals, in particular from the Kharkiv Scientific 
Research Institute ``Karbonat.'' However, in addition to good 
ideas, there must also be good money. 
  Lyudmyla Senchynok, associate at the state geological 
enterprise ``Luhanskheolohiya'' department in charge of 
accounting and utilizing subsurface water reserves and of 
studying their status, does not see any reassuring prospects 
either. 
  Senchynok: The reservoirs are overfilled, that is 
why the plant's operations are on the verge of being halted. 
Besides, the first reservoir was built back in 1898. The plant 
owner poured the brine into what was then a huge pit. The 
second storage pit was dug during the first five-year plan 
period. The two have already been buried under soil. 
Currently, there are dachas there. The third storage pit was 
built in 1969. Although it is better than its predecessors, it 
is far from being brine-proof. When, in 1976, the fourth 
storage pit was built, our requirements for adhering to norms 
were taken into account, but.... The dams of the existing 
storage pits could collapse any minute, because they were built 
with God knows what. Besides, karst structures have been 
revealed in those places. The solution reaches marl soils, a 
reaction takes place, and carbon dioxide forms as a result. 
This creates an additional hazard. 
  The storage pits are overfilled, there are no new ones, and 
new construction areas are not being prepared. 
  Kobelnyuk: Besides, there is a time bomb beneath 
those dachas? 
  Senchynok: Yes, even though there have been no 
explosions yet. Subsurface waters constantly wash sites of 
waste accumulation. We suggested that the waste be processed 
and dumped on the right bank of the Siverskyy Donets River, 
where aquifers are weak. However, even in the past there was no 
money for this, not to mention the situation now. 
  Kobelnyuk: What can be done with the brine? 
  Senchynok: The solid substance within its 
composition could be used for manufacturing medicines. There 
are some not very pleasant tasting calcium chloride tablets. 
This substance could also be used as a filler in the production 
of cement. However, it must be solid. It is too expensive to 
form briquets and that is not acceptable anyway. There was also 
a plan to carry the brine to Sivash Lake. However, it was 
realized that the pipes would soon turn into salt planks. 
  Kobelnyuk: Therefore, we can only wait and see 
what happens? 
  Senchynok: As a matter of fact, yes. The brine 
spill around the storage pits of the plant has spread to 30 
square meters over the drinking water horizon. We monitor the 
water composition with the help of boreholes. There were times 
when the spill grew very quickly, but now the situation is 
changing gradually.... 
  People within the ``triangle'' are already used to the 
``reactive'' -- saturated with various reagents -- air and look 
almost without care at the small clouds that are all the colors 
of the rainbow. People get used to anything. When the brine 
gets out of control, drinking water will disappear over scores 
of square kilometers. It will be impossible to get used to 
that: People will either have to turn into fish or pack their 
belongings.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Kostenko, Minister of Environmental </F>
Protection of Ukraine: ``More Precisely Speaking, the Extinction 
of the Population Is Occurring''] 
  [Text] Who are we? What guides us? 
  1. How do you see Ukraine from the heights of your position 
at the start of the new year of 1994? 
  2. Very little time is left for you to work as part of the 
current government before the new elections in 1994. What 
concrete steps do you intend to take so as to halt the further 
fall of Ukraine into the abyss of economic crisis? 
  1. Ukraine is experiencing extraordinarily difficult times. 
A 
precipitous destruction and pollution of the natural environment 
is occurring simultaneously with the economic disarray. The 
threat to the health of people and the genetic stock of the 
nation has become real. The quantity of birth defects among 
infants is increasing every year, and a natural decline in the 
population--or, more precisely speaking, its extinction--has 
been occurring since 1991. 
  The crisis state of the environment in Ukraine is 
conditioned 
mainly by the ecologically unsafe functioning of the senseless 
economic system that we inherited from the times of 
totalitarianism. Twice as much iron ore was extracted in Ukraine 
as in the United States at the end of the 1980s, as well as 
somewhat less coal than in Great Britain, France and the FRG 
taken together; as much steel as the FRG and France taken 
together was smelted every year. We have all always taken pride 
in that, and few gave any thought to the harm being done to 
nature. 
  But here are even ``better'' data. The imperfect 
technologies 
for the production and processing of raw minerals that are used 
in Ukraine lead to losses of up to 70 percent for oil, 50 
percent for salts, 40 percent for coal, and 2--5--with some even 
10--13 times--more than is required by contemporary technologies 
for metals. Close to 1.5 billion tonnes a year of natural 
substances are involved in the process of social production 
across Ukraine as a whole. More than half are them returned to 
the natural environment in the form of wastes that poison the 
surroundings. 
  But even that is not all. 
  We are continuing to augment power capacity, in particular 
nuclear, forgetting both the lessons of Chornobyl and the fact 
that the share of this sector is reaching 30 percent of the 
total emissions of harmful substances today. At the very same 
time, the overconsumption of energy at the enterprises of 
ferrous metallurgy alone in Ukraine, owing to their technical 
backwardness, is equivalent to the quantity of electric power 
generated by all the AESs [nuclear electric-power plants] of the 
former USSR. The energy-intensiveness of our output as a whole 
is six to eight times greater than the analogous measures for 
the leading Western countries. 
  The list of this economic self-cannibalism could be 
continued 
a great deal longer. Notwithstanding this state of affairs, 
understanding of the fact that the non-ecological development of 
the national economy, with sweeping and profound negative 
effects on the environment, could surpass the consequences of 
any aggression is still lacking in our society. Backward 
ecological thinking is unfortunately being demonstrated at all 
levels of the power structures. 
  A review that was conducted recently has shown that the 
specially created extra-budgetary environmental-protection funds 
of the Soviets of People's Deputies, which are responsible under 
prevailing legislation for the state of the environment within 
the bounds of their territories, are not being used primarily 
for their intended purposes. A whole series of cities in the 
Donetsk-Dnieper region, where only 20--30 percent of the fund is 
being used for environmental-protection measures, could be a 
negative example of this. The rest goes for ``patching holes'' 
in the local budgets. All of this is occurring in a region where 
the extent of contamination of the environment is the greatest 
in Ukraine. 
  Our republic budget, however, is the most instructive 
example 
of the lack of a statewide approach to the resolution of 
ecological problems. Just 0.2 percent of the gross national 
product (GNP) was envisaged for all environmental-protection 
measures in 1993. And that is in the face of the fact that 
economic losses are reaching far beyond 10 percent of the GNP as 
a consequence of the worsening state of the natural environment. 
By way of comparison, most of the ecologically clean countries 
of the West spend 2--4 percent of their GNPs on measures to 
protect the environment. The Minpryrody [Ministry of 
Environmental Protection] monitors just 10 percent of that 
symbolic amount, with the rest of the budget appropriations, 
without regard for ecological priorities, being monitored under 
the old sector principle by Minekonomiki [Ministry of Economics] 
and Minfin [Ministry of Finance]. 
  The state of affairs is no better in the system to monitor 
the upholding of environment-protection legislation. The 
Minpryrody of Ukraine only recently obtained the right to 
subject violators to administrative liability. As for ecological 
crimes--which are being committed everywhere--some bodies of the 
procuracy have taken a crazy stance. Instead of fighting against 
these crimes, they have made the object of their vigilant 
attention... Minpryrody itself. It is, of course, far easier to 
``point out shortcomings'' than it is to bring people to 
criminal liability, as recently happened, for example, with the 
bringing of toxic substances into the city of Rivne. But perhaps 
now is not the time to just ``point out,'' we need, as we are 
fond of saying, to ``pull the plow'' together so as to survive. 
  The terrible ecological situation in which Ukraine finds 
itself today has thus been conditioned by the inability of the 
post-communist system to act effectively. So we will never 
ourselves get out of this abyss without radical economic and 
ecological reform. 
  2. The principal efforts over the time that remains will be 
directed toward completing the work on ecological reform that we 
started last year. That is, the creation of the legal, 
organizational and financial conditions for the pursuit of an 
effective ecological policy in Ukraine. The essence of the 
problems lies in the necessity of resolving them as soon as 
possible, in the creation of mechanisms that would stimulate the 
ecologization of production and energy conservation. We are 
planning, for that purpose, to institute fees for the 
utilization of natural resources, introduce tax concessions for 
resource-conserving and ecologically clean technologies, and 
employ economic sanctions for the utilization of natural 
resources above and beyond standards for or their contamination. 
  All of these measures, which have to be the basic guidelines 
for a new state policy in the realm of protecting the 
environment and utilizing natural resources, will lead to the 
fact that it will become unprofitable for an enterprise to 
pollute the environment and consume resources excessively. More 
than twenty legal-standards documents have already been adopted 
in order to realize the socio-economic reform. 
  Also to be completed, aside from that, in the first half of 
1994 are: 
  --the development of a National Program for the protection 
of 
the natural environment; 
  --the development of a mechanism to compensate for 
ecological 
losses as a consequence of the functioning of trunk oil and gas 
pipelines, electrical-transmission lines and the transport of 
freights across the territory of Ukraine; 
  --the institution of a system of ecological certification 
and 
licensing; 
  --the development of regional ecological programs for the 
Dnieper, Donbass and Polissya, along with other documents. 
  The completion of that work would make it possible to launch 
the realization of a policy resulting in the gradual 
reproduction of a clean natural environment, a halt to the 
extinction of the Ukrainian people and economic prosperity as 
early as 1994. 
  But that is a task for the next government.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Boreyko: ``Top Secret: Black Coats </F>
against the Black Sea''] 
  [Text] In the 1950's, the battleship Novorossiysk sank in a 
Crimea harbor; 2,000 sailors went down. The year 1974 marked the 
end of a cruiser of the Krest class which burned down in the 
North Sea; 450 sailors were lost. In April 1987 a small 
rocket-armed boat blew up; 39 sailors died. Tragedies on Soviet 
Navy ships were a common occurrence. In the old days, the truth 
was simply covered up. The large destroyer Otvazhnyy sank on 30 
August 1974 in the Black Sea, near Sevastopol. Ammunition stores 
blew up and fire kept rescue ships from coming close. According 
to some information, hundreds of sailors perished. 
  Some time in the 1970's, a Soviet diesel boat also went 
down. 
The helicopter carrier Moskva caught fire several times. First 
time in 1971-72, then in 1989. In 1969, it hit itself with its 
own torpedo; thank God, it failed to explode. In the winter of 
1991, the engine on board the large destroyer Admiral Zakharov 
blew up near Vladivostok. The fire burned for 31 hours. Overall, 
from 1945 to 1989, some 200 serious accidents took place in the 
Soviet Navy. 
  While the destruction of navy boats was often the result of 
general negligence, unreliability of Soviet military technology 
and simple accidents, the dumping of ammunition into the sea 
occurred deliberately and maliciously--against the people and 
against nature. 
  Until 1989, the USSR Ministry of Defense had a secret order 
which permitted the dumping of ammunition into the sea. From 
February to May 1956, chemical weapons were transported from 
Obozerskaya Station in Arkhangelsk Oblast to Severodvinsk. They 
were unloaded and dumped in the White Sea. A year later, similar 
weapons were dumped around Spitsbergen. In 1960-61, from Saratov 
Oblast to Pechenega came trainloads of bombs weighing 100 
kilograms, 250 kilograms and 500 kilograms, of the 1939 vintage. 
The bombs contained mustard gas, lysite and zarine. Later, using 
Murmansk merchant marine vessels leased by the USSR Ministry of 
Defense, those chemical weapons were sunk in the vicinity of 
Novaya Semlya. Altogether, 183 trainloads of chemical weapons 
were shipped out of Pechenega. 
  During the past 40 years, metal casings have rusted through. 
Chemical weapons, like the genie from the fairy tale, got out of 
the bottle. The star fish were first to feel it. At the Cape of 
Dvina alone, 6 million of them were washed up. Then came the 
turn of the humans. According to data provided by Correspondent 
Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences A.Yablokov, advisor to 
President B.Yeltsin on environmental issues, mortality around 
Arkhangelsk has risen since 1991 by 10 percent. 
  At the bottom of the Baltic Sea lie between 100,000 tons and 
300,000 tons of poisonous compounds, mainly zarine and mustard 
gas. The Navy began sinking containers and weapons in the late 
1940's, and continued until 1965. It was done mainly in the 
vicinity of the Kristianse island and 56 miles south-west of the 
town of Liepaja, at the depth of just a few dozen meters, in the 
area of 780 square kilometers. 
  One shot of mustard gas diluted in 50 cubic meters of salt 
water is capable of killing a horse. Specialists predict that 
if, God forbid, the gas seeps out of the rusted casings and 
shells, the total amount would be sufficient to kill the Baltic 
Sea four times over. Danger threatens the 30 million people who 
live along the shores of the Baltic. The deadline for the 
weapons is drawing near: only 10 years remain. The number of 
victims is already growing. Some 100 Danish fishermen became 
disabled after catching old chemical shells in their nets. The 
same happened to fishermen from Klaipeda. Who will be the next 
victim? The sea often washes pieces of yellow phosphorus onto 
the shore. God forbid you pick one up, mistaking it for amber. 
  Soviet strategists did not neglect other seas, either, 
namely 
the Barents and Karsk seas. Orders were issued to dump there 
nuclear waste from nuclear-powered submarines. Containers with 
liquid and solid nuclear wastes were transported on the same 
Murmansk Merchant Marine vessels and dumped into the sea; as 
they did not sink, they where blasted with assault rifles. 
Somewhere here is the final resting place of the expired engine 
from the nuclear-powered ice breaker Lenin. 
  According to Greenpeace, in the vicinity of Novaya Zemlya 
lie 
tens of thousands of containers with radioactive materials; the 
Soviet Northern Fleet annually dumped into the sea 10,000 cubic 
meters of liquid and 200,000 cubic meters of solid wastes in 
different stages of nuclear decay. In the Karsk Sea, 13 to 20 
Soviet nuclear reactors have been dumped, some still containing 
nuclear fuel. Total radioactive pollution of the northern seas 
by the Soviet Union reaches 2.2-3.2 million curie, which is 
between 2 and 4 times higher than the level of harm caused to 
the Atlantic by Western countries. 
  In May 1941, Soviet sailors dumped mustard gas, which was no 
longer needed at military bases, into the Sea of Japan, not far 
from Vladivostok, at the depth of only 1 kilometer. 
  On 9 October 1990 the Tsezar Kunikov was loaded at the port 
of the Kamish-Burunskiy iron ore complex in Kerch with unused 
ammunition. On orders from the technical administration of the 
Black Sea Fleet, it was transported to the ship from one of the 
military warehouses in Kerch. The environmental protection 
agency wanted to intervene, but it was rebuffed. The cargo was 
dumped in the Black Sea at the depth of 2 kilometers; according 
to some data, it has been done more than once. 
  What has been done cannot be undone, says ancient 
philosopher 
Theognides. But what could be done is find out what had been 
dumped, punish the guilty, forbid such actions in the future and 
raise the weapons from the bottom of the sea and discharge them. 
But the leadership of the former UkSSR State Committee on the 
Environment (V.Filonenko, chairman; I.Lyakh, first deputy; and 
V.Cherednychenko, head of the water resources protection 
department) took no steps in that direction. Only an 
investigative commission was set up, without informing either 
the government or the press. A report was sent to Moscow, to the 
USSR State Committee on the Environment, to Deputy Director 
V.Kostrin, numbered 11-S and dated 26 February 1991. But there, 
another reorganization was underway at the time and no answer 
came to Kiev. (Former Admiral Kasatonov, commander of the Black 
Sea Fleet, later officially admitted that weapons of a certain 
type were dumped into the Black Sea, quadrant 72-73, without the 
sanction of environmental protection authorities.) 
  Highly placed protectors of the environment in Ukraine 
calmed 
down. They kept their well-paid positions. For example, Lyakh 
was not only a deputy minister but also chief state inspector 
for environmental protection issues. 
  According to the Sevastopol newspaper OSTROV KRYM, in June 
1942, on orders of Commander F.Oktyabrskyy, ``poisonous 
compounds of military use''--mainly mustard gas--were dumped by 
Soviet sailors in the Black Sea, around Kazachya Bukhta, at the 
depth of up to 50 meters. 
  The terrible genie is buried at the bottom of the Black Sea. 
In the Baltic and the White Sea it will come out in 10 years. 
How long will it be for Ukraine?

and wrote down in the log: ``I was here. Very impressive. 
Nikolay Podgornyy.'' But he would have been even more impressed 
if he had stopped by the main base of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  Sevastopol harbor. Some 7,000 cubic meters of polluted water 
and 10 tons of oil flowed into it every 24 hours. Estimate 
damage: R328,000 at the prices of the time. 
  In the mid-1980s, there were 10 major oil spills. They cost 
R211,000. In 1990 the damage rose to R1 million. Pollution in 
the Sevastopol harbor surpasses the acceptable level by 30 to 
100 times. In June 1988, it was 2,000 times above normal. Add to 
this some 10 military boats and submarines, half-sunken and 
rusting there. 
  Fleet fuel base at Inkerman. Who ever said that there are 
shortages of oil in Ukraine? There is a veritable source here, a 
magic lake the size of Independence Square in Kiev. And there is 
even more under ground. 
  Where did it come from? At first, the Navy blamed the 
Romans, 
who supposedly stored the Greek fire here during the Second 
Punic War. Then they put the blame on the Nazis. But the truth 
is different. In the 1970s, some fool thought of storing oil in 
abandoned mine shafts: an inexpensive and practical solution. 
Apparently, he was even decorated for his ingenuity. But in time 
the shafts developed cracks and the oil seeped into the sea. 
  And there is more. A proposal is being discussed to turn the 
Sevastopol harbor into a terminal for shipping oil to foreign 
money bags. Not only the harbor, but Lake Donuzlav, may be 
polluted with oil. 
  The base at Inkerman has been poisoning the sea since 1904. 
Especially strongly from the mid-1950's. But environmental 
protection authorities discovered this only in the mid-1980's. 
Incidentally, the famous Central Committee and USSR Council of 
Ministers Resolution No. 42, dated 16 January 1976, ``On 
Measures to Prevent Pollution of the Black and Azov Seas'' died 
in infancy. 
  26 March 1976. The Navy supply ship Vasiliy 
Golovin, upon leaving Artbukhta, secretly dumped sewerage. This 
was noticed by some tourists who reported the incident to the 
State Inspection for the Protection of the Black Sea. The 
environmentalists confirmed: 24 kilos was dumped, and damages 
amounted to R5,000. But they were not allowed onto the military 
ship; the Navy itself wrote a report declaring the the Vasiliy 
Golovin caused no harm to the sea. 
  Early 1992. The beautiful cruiser Moskva spilled 
fuel into the sea. Fortunately, it did not form a film but 
spilled as a wave. But, once again, no one was allowed to 
investigate: the excuse of secrecy never failed. Meanwhile, the 
military prosecutor's office was asleep. Its full official name 
was the Military Prosecutor's Office of the Black Sea Fleet: 
they would not be sticking their necks out. 
  Yu. Shcherbak, the former minister of environmental 
protection of Ukraine, kept sending angry cables to the 
commander of the Black Sea, but the old salt did not even blink. 
  The state spent considerable sums to equip Navy ships with 
special containers for refuse, but the mighty Black Sea Fleet 
has virtually no ships to collect them. Ships the world over 
transfer their left-over fuel to special collection boats, but 
the admirals have few of them, as well. 
  Soviet military boats, unlike Western ones, have no 
environmental protection equipment and dump all their garbage 
into the sea. While they often drive their sailors to exhaustion 
by making them scrub the decks until they shine, mates, captains 
and admirals at the same time successfully turn the Black Sea 
into a cesspool. 
  The Sevastopol Navy Plant named after Sergo Ordzhonikidze, 
the Iron Commissar, quietly dumped sulfuric acid into the 
Chernaya river. 
  The navy wharf in Nikolaev, Plant imeni 61 Communards, was 
building the flagship Komsomolets Ukrainy, the pride of the 
Navy. The ship was not finished, but the Ingul river was 
polluted with paint, diesel and oil. 
  The well-known resort Kuyalnik is harmed by the navy 
installation in the village of Krasnosilka. The same happens in 
Yevpatoria, Kerch, Feodosia, Balaklava, Khersones, Ismail and 
Nikolaev, in short, everywhere where the Navy has a presence. 
  In the late 1980's, spurred on by perestroyka, two 
ministers--D.Protsenko, the head of the UkSSR State 
Environmental Protection Committee, and V.Tkach, the UkSSR 
minister of water resources--entered into a mild confrontation 
with Admiral Khronopulo, the commander of the Black Sea Fleet. 
Please be so kind to forgive us, respected comrade admiral, for 
disturbing you in your important work, but could you reduce just 
a little the dumping of oil into the sea? Khronopulo paid them 
no attention; on the contrary, he apparently ordered his 
assistants to telephone Kiev and to cut the ministers down to 
size. What does it matter, nature, if we are protecting the 
sacred borders of our Motherland? The ministers held their 
tongues. 
  But soon Dina Yosipivna Protsenko was caught up in the 
Golsiyskyy forest scandal and was replaced by Viktor Lazarovych 
Fidonenko, a man who had risen through the ranks of the 
republic's agricultural industry sector. A new broom sweeps in a 
new way, and the fresh minister, who had not yet suffered his 
share of hard knocks, decided to set things straight on the 
Black Sea. He sent one petition to Sevastopol, then another. He 
also ordered his services to start catching old salts on the 
spot, and fining them. This was the response he received from 
the admiral: 
  Since 1989, the Special Inspection for the Protection of the 
Black Sea, which is currently under your management, has started 
to make claims and conduct investigations of the fuel base of 
the Fleet for the purpose of extracting damages for the 
pollution of the Sevastopol harbor with oil products. 
  This year, the fuel base has already received three claims 
totaling R85,800, of which two were reviewed by the state 
arbitrage commission of the Crimea Oblast (for R9,300), and one 
by the state arbitrage commission of the UkSSR (for R76,500). 
  In September came yet another claim for the sum of R168,600; 
another, for R250,000, is being prepared even though the special 
reserve at the fuel base bears no responsibility for the 
pollution of the sea with oil products and has experienced no 
accidental spills... 
  Taking everything stated above into consideration, I request 
that you, as the head of the UkSSR State Environmental 
Protection Committee, take all objective circumstances into 
account and order the Special Inspection for the Protection of 
the Black Sea to DESIST from submitting complaints and suits 
against the fuel base of the Fleet... 
  Systematic extortion of large monetary sums from the Fleet 
for the alleged violations of water protection laws, which were 
not, objectively, the result of the Fleet's activity, 
catastrophically reduces the Fleet's ability to contribute to 
the repair and construction of capital water protection 
structures. 
  Please inform me of your decision. 
  Admiral M.Khronopulo, member of the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of Ukraine. 
  That was exactly how he signed it, member of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, without any 
``respectfully yours.'' The hint was clear. 
  To poison the life of the environmental protection minister 
further, he also complained to the Council of Ministers, to 
Anatoliy Sergeevich Statinov. Viktor Lazarovych Filonenko bit 
his tongue and began to fear Khronopulo, shifting his efforts to 
the strengthening of friendly ties with foreign countries. 
  Incidentally, under the new minister of the Environmental 
Ministry Yuriy Mykolayovych Shcherbak, the position responsible 
for the protection of the sea disappeared. Out of sight, as the 
saying goes. 
  As for Khronopulo, he began to ignore the environment 
altogether. Of the R5.2 million of capital investment funds 
allocated in 1990 to the Black Sea Fleet, he did not give a 
kopek for the environment. 
  He postponed the construction of treatment plants in many 
harbors to the period to the year 2005. At least in the past 
they used to control oil spills from aircraft, but now this 
practice was discontinued. And at Foros and other supersecret 
resorts such overflights were never allowed. 
  Khronopulo has since retired, and has become a business 
leader. Hold the flag high, Admiral. 
  March 13, 1991. In the Black Sea, at 44.08 
northern latitude and 34.37 eastern longitude a heavy oil spill 
is discovered. Apparently, it was another destoyer that got 
washed. But while flights are coordinated with the military and 
the papers signed, the spill moves into the resort area, which 
are under special security protection and where 
environmentalists are not allowed within a rifle shot. 
  Today, with the excuse of an ``unhealthy political situation 
surrounding the Fleet,'' ships have become completely off limits 
to environmental inspections; Sevastopol captains have now been 
given a unique opportunity to paint the Black Sea an oil-black 
color. 
  In the early days of the Russian Navy, legendary Admiral 
Sinyavin issued a strict order forbidding the pollution of the 
Don with refuse and sewerage. He understood that defense cannot 
be the used as an excuse for spoiling the environment. His 
modern heirs on the Black Sea, while constantly talking about 
building up the glorious traditions of the Russian Navy, in 
reality act differently. 
<H5>  Dolphins as Torpedoes </H5>
  The No.7 bus goes to Khersones, to Kazachya Bukhta. There, 
at 
the outskirts of Sevastopol, a supersecret Navy installation is 
located, a dolphin aquarium. It opened in 1966. No money was 
spared: a villa was built and imported equipment was installed. 
  The installation had two goals: two teach military science 
to 
dolphins and to entertain the powers that be. The Fleet 
commander had his private yacht and dacha here. Next door was 
the Central Committee's resort Foros. Brezhnev and Ustinov came 
regularly, with their kids, friends and grandchildren, to admire 
the dolphins. Very exotic. 
  The military goal presented greater difficulties. Dolphins 
were drafted into military service by certain fishing boats 
which received the sanction of local fishing inspections. Their 
catching methods were barbaric, causing great losses. Sometimes 
up to 80 percent of the catch was lost. 
  At the Sevastopol aquarium, some 50 dolphins, beluga whales 
and sea lions began guarding navy bases and anchorages against 
enemy commandos, clearing sea lanes of mines, searching and 
lifting weapons from the bottom of the sea, destroying ships and 
commandos and repairing river dams. The imperialist tricks had 
to be guarded against not only on the ground and in the air, but 
under water, as well. 
  The idea was as follows. Special buoys would be installed 
along the perimeter of the base. A dolphin would swim to it, 
press a button, get a fish and continue on. If it noticed enemy 
divers, it would shoot at them with an explosive packet and get 
away. An explosion--and the enemy commandos are no more. And 
what about the dolphin? 
  The idea was barbarically stupid. What if the dolphin gets 
ill or confused and blows up its own boat. Or shoots a wrong 
diver? Each action provokes counteraction. Offensive weapons 
produce defensive weapons. The enemy, suspecting a possible 
attack from dolphins, seals, sea lions, the Loch Ness monster or 
any other creature with a tail, may simply poison the given 
section of the sea. Intelligent and kind dolphins, which have 
been registered in the Red Book, and their friends would perish. 
But the admirals do not care. The goal has been set, the task 
has determined, the funds have been allocated. Let us go 
fishing, to catch more dolphins. 
  According to our information, bases where sea animals used 
to 
carry out their military service, or where they may continue to 
serve today, are spread throughout the former USSR: in the Far 
East, in Murmansk Oblast and in the town of Dalniye Zelentsy, 
where apparently experiments on seals were conducted. 
  It is sad that the evolution of our admirals' conscience 
lags 
behind the development of technology and the progress of reason. 
The Americans have long given up on Navy dolphins. But not we.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``Atomic Electric Power Plants [AES] </F>
Are Coming to Our Help''] 
  [Text] As reported by Ukraine's State Committee for Atomic 
Energy, last year, Ukrainian nuclear plants produced 75,238,900 
kilowatt/hours of electricity. This is 111 percent of what was 
planned. The energy output of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power 
station accounted for 42.76 percent of the total amount of 
electricity produced by all the nuclear power stations. 
  At the same time, the extension of the period of maintenance 
work at the Khmelnytskyy nuclear power station and individual 
faults in the operation of all of the nuclear power stations led 
to the failure to produce 8,071,110 kilowatt/hours more. Last 
year, a total of 239 accidents were recorded at nuclear power 
stations. As a result of 62 of them, power units were halted, 
and 109 led to power reductions. None of the accidents involved 
an increase in the radioactive background at the stations or 
around them. 
  In 1993, the share of the energy produced by Ukrainian 
nuclear power stations increased again. While in 1990, it 
amounted to 25.7 percent; in 1991 -- 27.1 percent; and in 1992 
-- 29.4 percent; in 1993, it reached 32.9 percent. Since 18 
January 1994, five Ukrainian nuclear power stations have been 
producing 42 percent of the total daily output of electric 
energy. Problems with deliveries of organic fuel are making 
themselves felt.

  [Text] Zaporozhye January 29 TASS--The problem of storing 
nuclear fuel waste at Ukrainian nuclear power plants will 
possibly be resolved with the help of a contract concluded 
between the Zaporozhskaya AES amalgamation and the U.S. Duke 
Power Company. 
  Ukraine has no facilities to process nuclear fuel waste. 
Earlier, processing was done in Russia. Ukrainian nuclear 
plants have stockpiled a lot of used magazines after Russia's 
refusal to receive waste for processing. They are now kept at 
``cooling'' ponds which are virtually filled up. 
  If the problem is not resolved in the next 12-18 months, 
operating power units of nuclear plants should be switched off 
one by one. 
  The UKRINFORM news agency reports that storage facilities of 
the Duke Power Company have a general licence of the U.S. 
leading control organisation and are already in operation at 
three American nuclear power plants and two nuclear laboratories. 
  The Zaporozhye nuclear power plant has already started work 
to implement the contract: an ecological and technological 
feasibility report is now being drafted. 
  If this and following work is successful, Ukraine will have 
the first stage of such a storage facility for nuclear waste by 
the end of 1995. 
  In the agency's opinion, the construction of similar 
storages 
at other nuclear stations will help stabilise the situation in 
this field and to resolve the problem of temporary storage of 
nuclear fuel waste.

<F P=106> [Article signed Patricia Labiane: ``A `MUST' For Avoiding </F>
Water Pollution''] 
  [Text] Just one storm and everything is overflowing. The 
sewers spill out onto the land, the water is full of heavy 
metals and hydrocarbons, etc. Heavy rainfall can multiply by up 
to 10 times the rate of pollution recorded during periods of dry 
weather. Water treatment stations are not capable of handling 
pollution exceeding three or four times that for dry weather 
conditions and do not perform their regulating role. The MUST 
[expansion unknown] project, launched by the Corporation for the 
Treatment and Economic Development of Water [OTV], a subsidiary 
of the Compagnie Generale des Eaux [CGE], proposes checking the 
overflow of waste water after periods of heavy rainfall. The 
European scientific research program, EUREKA [European Research 
Coordination Agency], found the scheme attractive enough to 
award it its European label last June. 
  The MUST technology will be implemented progressively over 
the next four years. Of the 96.6 million French francs [Fr] it 
will cost, France will contribute Fr32 million, Fr10 million of 
which will come from the Ministries of Industry, Post and 
Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade. 
  The project, which replies to a European directive of May 
1991, combines 10 industrial partners from four Community 
countries. In addition to OTV from France, project leaders 
include the Danish pollution removal systems engineers I. 
Kruger, the Finnish chemical reagent producers Kemira Kemwater, 
and the British modeling researcher Wallingford Software. OTV, 
the European leader in the design and production of water 
treatment plants, is the prime contractor, assisted in France by 
other CGE subsidiaries: the Anjou Research economic interest 
grouping -- which centralizes the group's research work -- and 
Cochery-Bourdin-Chausse, specializing in road infrastructures. 
<H5>  Precise Statistics </H5>
  The project corresponds to a market with local communities 
estimated to be worth several hundreds of billions of francs 
over the next 20 years, a large share of which should return to 
the Compagnie Generale des Eaux. On the practical side of 
things, the project will propose ``reservoir highways'' 
underneath roads to collect rain water, new physical-chemical 
settling techniques for treatment plants, a system for storing 
the most polluted water before treatment, treatment plant 
biofilters that are better suited to respond to large 
fluctuations in flow, sensors to inform the plant of the level 
of pollution in the water that will be arriving, etc. 
<H5>  Computerized Rain </H5>
  The project also envisages carrying out a whole series of 
statistical studies that will simplify the adaptation of water 
treatment equipment. Patrick Binot, OTV's deputy technical 
director and head of development, explains: ``For a given 
period, a rainfall curve is run through a computer model to 
determine the amount of polluting substances released in an 
average year by a given network and treatment plant, which can 
thus be minimized.'' This gives a whole armory with which to 
face up to any rain shower.

<F P=106> [``das''--signed report: ``Environment -- Winners on Both </F>
Sides''] 
  [Text] Vienna -- European Union [EU] Director-General for 
Environmental Affairs Laurens Jan Brinkhorst said in Vienna that 
it was wrong to believe that Austria could be outvoted in the 
European Union by less environment-considerate member states. 
He rejected such concerns. Environmental protection was not a 
beauty contest, he said, or a football match of everyone against 
everyone else; so there would be winners on both sides, once the 
chapter on environmental issues in the membership negotiations 
was concluded. This is what Brinkhorst and Environment Minister 
Maria Rauch-Kallat stressed, who added that she assessed the 
environment package of December as ``gratifyingly favorable.'' 
  Brinkhorst spoke about the changed significance of the 
environment, which manifested itself in the European 
Commission's Whitebook of December. According to this study, 
environmental protection was no longer considered an obstacle 
but was viewed as a condition of lasting economic development, 
as progress in the area of competition, and as a job creating 
instrument. Environmental protection in the European Union was 
a dynamic process, which in recent years had made considerable 
progress and in which the European Union needed Austria as a 
partner, said Brinkhorst. 
  The director general, who is also responsible for nuclear 
safety, said that a country's decision for or against nuclear 
energy was not influenced by the European Union, whereas nuclear 
safety was a common affair. Environment Minister Rauch-Kallat 
cited this EU task to justify the fact that any contribution 
made by Austria, which rejects nuclear power in its government 
policy, will flow into Euratom's nuclear research.

<F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: ``Finnish Forestry Acquiring </F>
an Ecological Dimension''] 
  [Text] Finnish forests are growing older all the time and 
forest growth exceeds the amount of timber that is cut. Thus 
there is no reason for concern on this score. 
  But to a large extent the aging Finnish forests are also 
so-called managed forests, forests that have already been 
affected by logging and forest management. These forests lack 
the really old trees, the dead and rotting trees and vegetation 
that many fungi, beetles, mosses, and lichens need for survival. 
  ``We have talked a lot in Finland about forestry and how to 
take care of our managed forests without paying enough attention 
to the ecological dimension and the multiplicity of species,'' 
said chief supervisor Pertti Rassi of the Environment Ministry. 
``Nor has enough research been done in the 1980's on the effect 
efficient forestry has had on the flora and fauna in our 
forests.'' 
  But now there is agreement that ecology must be taken into 
account in forest management and no irreparable damage has yet 
occurred, according to Rassi. He is also chairman of the working 
group that is making an inventory of Finland's old forests. The 
inventory of southern Finland is complete but work is still 
being done on a list of forests in Lapland. 
  There is also a political consensus on the need to protect 
our last natural forests and the government could issue a 
directive as early as next week on the preservation of around 
10,000 hectares of state-owned forestland in southern Finland. 
There is also a need to protect around 5,000 hectares of private 
land, but according to Rassi this will be an expensive operation. 
<H5>  Thickets, Scrub Growth Scarce </H5>
  Around two-thirds of Finland is covered with forests today 
and around 2 percent of the forests are part of a protected 
area. In the southern part of the country only 1 percent of the 
forests are protected; the big protected areas are north of 
Uleaborg. According to Rassi there are also gaps in the mapping 
that was done to determine the protection needs in Lapland south 
of the Arctic Circle and there is a special need for increased 
forest protection in this area. 
  ``We estimate that there are at least 65,000 hectares of 
forest worth protecting in Lapland,'' said Rassi, whose working 
group has now received an expanded mandate to inventory the 
Lapland forests. Most of the projected protection areas are 
located on state-owned land. 
  Even if regional forestry boards were reprimanded for 
logging 
and inadequate protection of their forests, there would be no 
very old forests left on privately owned land, Rassi pointed 
out. Private forests and those belonging to logging companies 
have been managed according to economic principles in order to 
produce the biggest possible yield. 
<H5>  Research Lagging Behind </H5>
  Sound forestry became a common term back in the 1980's, but 
the concept was not given much weight in Finland, according to 
the Environment Ministry supervisor. Biodiversity and the 
multiplicity of species have been lacking in forest research 
here, while in Sweden, for example, it has been included in 
research since the 1970's when they began discussing these 
issues there. 
  The endangered species in Finland that have received the 
most 
publicity and are dying out precisely because of the lack of old 
forests are the white-backed woodpecker and the flying squirrel. 
But there are also other woodpecker species and many kinds of 
beetles and fungi that do not survive in managed forests. There 
is not enough space for species that live solely in thickets or 
in old scrub growth in particular. 
  When considering which areas should be preserved and 
protected, forest age and structure are taken into account, 
Rassi noted. The idea is to make it possible to ensure the 
survival of species in these areas and to provide a sufficiently 
varied forest environment that also contains old and rotting 
trees. 
<H5>  Species Must Now Be Preserved </H5>
  The basis for forest management today, one that all sides 
are 
in relative agreement on, is to prevent other species from dying 
out in our forests, Rassi said. One problem is that as a result 
of the lack of research in the 1980's we lack a clear picture of 
what has actually been lost, he complained. 
  But if we look at research results from Sweden and try to 
apply them here, around 15 percent of Finnish forests should be 
protected to safeguard biodiversity. Preserving the animal 
species that exist today will be a very demanding task, 
according to Rassi. 
  ``To do this, approximately 1 million hectares of forest 
would have to be designated as protected areas and we are not 
yet even halfway there,'' he said. ``There are simply not enough 
economic resources to protect all the forests that should be 
included.'' 
  However, forestry can be managed differently, and in recent 
months the people in charge of practical logging operations in 
the forests have been retrained in accordance with the 
principles of sound forestry, Rassi said. There is also 
agreement on which methods are sound, he said, so these kinds of 
measures should eventually be seen in the forests. One problem 
when one discusses forests and growth is that the time 
perspective is so long that it is hard to see the results of 
various measures in the period of a single generation. 
<H5>  Forests Get Along Without Us </H5>
  ``It will be five or 10 years before we have research 
results 
that tell us what should be done in the forests, even though we 
need the results now,'' Rassi pointed out. ``Much time will be 
lost before the decisions that are made by politicians and the 
authorities get down to the concrete level in the forest, I 
fear.'' 
  The worst that could happen is a failure to prevent more 
species from becoming extinct and a continued decline in the 
number of species that cause irreparable damage. If we get into 
a situation where fungi, lichens, and beetles have disappeared 
and the forest cannot get along without human assistance and 
intervention, we will have caused irreparable damage, he pointed 
out. 
  In the past forests renewed themselves as a result of forest 
fires, for example, and Rassi thinks controlled burning is still 
a good way to renew forests. Unfortunately it is also an 
expensive method, he noted. 
  The age structure in our forests is such that the forests 
are 
now growing older, and efficient forestry and managed forests 
have not caused any damage that cannot be repaired, in Rassi's 
opinion. He is now hoping for a comprehensive inventory that 
also includes private forests. The working group that is 
currently reviewing the forests in Lapland should finish the job 
in 1995.

<F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: ``Inquiry To Polish Our </F>
Forestry Reputation''] 
  [Text] The Environment Ministry has appointed a one-man 
board of inquiry to prepare a strategy that will guarantee 
biodiversity in Finnish forests. The strategy will be ready by 
the end of February and will also be aimed at improving 
Finland's reputation in forestry circles, according to 
Environment Minister Sirpa Pietikainen. The strategy will be 
adapted to the environmental program for forestry that the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is currently drafting. 
  The forest strategy will be the Environment Ministry's 
position on how Finnish forests should be managed and protected 
and as such, according to Pietikainen, it will provide 
guidelines for both state and private forestry. She does not 
think a decision in principle at the government level is needed 
on this issue. 
  ``The Environment Ministry is the authority that is 
responsible for forest management and biodiversity, therefore 
the ministry's position is the same as Finland's position,'' 
Pietikainen said. 
  Behind the need to draw up an integrated strategy on 
forestry 
and the protection of old forests in our country lie both the 
principles Finland is committed to in accordance with the UN's 
Rio conference on the environment and development and the 
reorganization that is currently under way at both the forestry 
and environmental administrations. In addition the recent 
discussion of forest policy both in this country and abroad 
revealed a lack of knowledge that could damage Finland's 
reputation on forestry issue, the environment minister said. 
  Some 727 of the endangered species in this country, 43 
percent of the total, live in forests. To preserve the abundance 
of species it is important to also preserve the old primeval 
forests, and the working group that has reviewed the need to 
protect old forests has proposed protecting 23,000 hectares of 
forestland in all. Last Friday the first specific areas were 
protected in accordance with the group's proposal, a unified 
area in Talaskangas and scattered areas in western Finland. 
  Next year a supplemental proposal will also be presented on 
the protection of old forests south of Uleaborg on both state 
and private lands. By the end of October 1995 another proposal 
on protecting forests north of Uleaborg will be ready. 
  Currently there is a shortage of protected areas in southern 
sections of Lapland, according to the Environment Ministry. 
Kajanaland and northern Lapland have more protected forests. 
Some 30,000 hectares of old forest in southern Lapland and 
Kajanaland are protected and less than 10,000 hectares of this 
kind of forest are protected in southern Finland. Finland has 
41,500 hectares of protected forests in all, representing 2.3 
percent of the country's forest area. 
  However, the Environment Ministry points out that it is not 
enough to protect forests; scattered protection areas do not 
guarantee the survival of species. Forest management also plays 
a central role and education in sound forest management that is 
more compatible with nature is included in training programs in 
forest districts.

  [Text] The sale and use of asbestos and products containing 
asbestos will be banned in 1994. There has been a ban on 
importing and producing asbestos since the beginning of this 
year. When the new regulations go into effect, asbestos will be 
permitted only in certain special cases. 
  Chief supervisor Kirsi Makela of the Labor Ministry's Worker

<F P=106> [Article by Pasi Tuohimaa: ``Drinking Water for Hundreds of </F>
Thousands of Finns Doesn't Fulfill EEA Requirements''] 
  [Text] Stricter rules become effective at the end of the 
year. Removal of excess manganese and iron costs 2 billion 
markkas. 
  It is estimated that the drinking water used by hundreds of 
thousands of Finns will not be within legal limits at the 
beginning of next year, when new restriction become effective in 
connection with the EEA [European Economic Area] treaty. In the 
near future, 100 to 200 groundwater utility companies and about 
30 surface water utility companies will have to take measures 
concerning excess levels of iron and manganese. 
  Small water intake plants, which are located in groundwater 
areas with high iron levels, will face the toughest challenge. 
The water cleaning bill will, relatively speaking, be the 
highest for them. At the same time, pressure to increase water 
rates will grow. 
<H5>  Majority Does Not Fulfill Manganese Requirements </H5>
  A work group appointed by the National Board of Waters and 
Environment estimated that, by the year 2000, Finland must 
invest 2 billion markkas in order to bring all of the country's 
drinking water up to EC standards. 
  The new drinking water regulations apply to all water 
supplies with over 50 users. The most urgent repairs must be 
performed at water companies servicing over 5,000 people, as 
they must immediately file reports with the EU [European Union]. 
Today, almost half of the large water utility companies exceed 
the accepted limits. 
  The current target manganese level is 0.1 mg per liter, 
while 
the EU directive specifies less than .05 mg per liter. Water 
quality requirements, thus, become much more stringent. 
  Based on information from 1987, there are 60 water utility 
companies in Finland that currently are unable to reach the 
figures required by the directive, not even by considering 
annual averages. If we use as a frame of reference, as 
stipulated in the directive, the highest measured 
concentrations, most water utility companies in Finland are 
unable to satisfy the requirements. 
  The current iron target concentration of 0.2 mg per liter 
will become a requirement. Based on 1987 information, the 
average iron concentration of water treated and sent out for 
distribution exceeds the target value at approximately 50 water 
companies. When tap water is tested, 140 companies exceed the 
limit. 
  The majority of these water utility companies are located in 
the provinces of Turku, Pori, Vaasa, and Oulu. 
  The iron problem is not felt that much by water utility 
companies in larger cities, which use surface water. 
  Based on the latest information, the only ones not affected 
by the more stringent water policies of health authorities are 
households using well water. It would be a significant problem 
in Finland to monitor every well, as there are about a million 
wells that are used by individual households. According to a 
study that was completed in the summer, of these, about 750,000 
yield water of poor quality. 
<H5>  Directive Also To Apply to Dairies </H5>
  However, the new regulations would apply to all water that 
is 
used in the industrial production of foodstuffs. A conservative 
interpretation of these rules would suggest that dairy farms, at 
least, would have to bring up their water supply to EC levels. 
  In reality, it is not possible to take care of all problems 
immediately, even if required by law. According to Senior 
Engineer Leena Hiisvirta of the Ministry of Social Affairs and 
Health there will be no transfer periods; the new regulations 
will become effective immediately. 
  However, the ministry can grant special dispensation to 
water 
intake plants whose water values exceed the permissible limits, 
on a case-by-case basis. Depending on the design of the 
necessary cleaning facility, the dispensation may be granted for 
anywhere from a few months to a few years. 
  But the authorities are still not intending to get too rough 
on the water utilities. Hiisvirta, who participated in the 
negotiations in Brussels last September, said that the new 
regulations will not be printed and distributed to district 
health and water authorities until February. 
<H5>  Same Problems in All Countries </H5>
  Hiisvirta pacifies those who fear disciplinary measures by 
the EU Commission. 
  ``All European nations have experienced the same kind of 
problems. The problems with the Commission are ironed out. The 
citizens' worrying is the largest problem. We do not follow the 
letter of the law anymore as we are used to, and the Finnish 
water supply is not as good as we had thought, after all,'' she 
said. 
  ``If a water intake plant has not been granted dispensation, 
it is obligated to pay compensatory damages for, for example, 
damages caused by too high concentrations of iron,'' added 
Hiisivirta. 
  The current quality requirements for water used by 
households 
in Finland were issued in 1990. According to Environmental 
Director Pekka Jalkanen with the Finnish Federation of 
Municipalities, even at that time, close attention was paid to 
permissible concentrations according to the current EC directive. 
  ``The most significant change is that earlier quality 
targets 
or recommendations are now changing to quality requirements or 
regulations,'' he said. 
  The EU Commission does not differentiate between water 
health 
hazards and other quality requirements that, until now, have 
been the policy in Finland.

<F P=106> [Article by Pentti Laitinen: ``Mining Counselor Casimir </F>
Ehrnrooth on the Environmental Debate: `The Industry Must Take 
the Offensive'''] 
  [Text] According to Mining Counselor Casimir Ehrnrooth, the 
forestry industry has failed in bringing forth its own views in 
the environmental debate. ``It is therefore extremely disturbing 
that the public debate has sunk as low as it has today,'' noted 
Ehrnrooth during his interview with HELSINGIN SANOMAT. 
  ``It should be easy for the industry to participate in this 
debate, as it has nothing to hide,'' he noted. 
<H5>  Above the Wild Public Debate </H5>
  Ehrnrooth, chairman of the board of Kymmene Oy, emphasized 
that he is an individual thinker when it comes to current issues 
surrounding the forestry industry. 
  In his view, it is possible that even the current management 
of the Kymmene Group may have different opinions on the matters. 
Ehrnrooth has been the chairman of the Central Federation of 
Finnish Forest Industries and the Central Federation of Finnish 
Industry for many years. 
  In Ehrnrooth's view, the forestry industry should embark on 
a 
counterattack that should use an information strike based on 
scientific fact as its weapon. This endeavor would be supported 
by an international panel of scientists. 
  ``One can certainly find bad conditions in the field, but 
the 
discussion regarding them must be elevated to a higher level, 
above the wild public debate. New argumentation must be 
developed, because it has become evident that the industry is 
unable to hold its own in today's public debate,'' said 
Ehrnrooth. 
  According to Ehrnrooth, one should remember that within the 
forestry industry, significant changes have taken place by means 
of normal industrial evolution. For example, in his view, 
Greenpeace and other environmental organizations have not 
contributed to the fact that the pollution of waters has 
decreased in severity to a fraction of what it was 20 years ago. 
  Ehrnrooth would like to see all the industry in Europe 
joining forces for a counterattack, as Finland, by itself, 
cannot dictate its views on the markets. ``Precise argumentation 
is necessary, as intimations only worsen the situation,'' he 
said. 
  ``It is almost inconceivable that the industry has been 
unable, in connection with the talk about recycling, for 
example, to present its views on the burning of waste. The 
debate is conducted on the terms of Greenpeace and other 
movements, and the industry's attempts to defend itself have met 
with varied success. A large portion of fiber-based wastepaper 
lends itself to recycling, but clearly the best way of getting 
rid of bad cut is burning, at today's technology level. That is 
fire without smoke,'' said Ehrnrooth. 
  According to Ehrnrooth, the industry has been unable to 
close 
its ranks, because, in a confused situation some parties will 
experience short-term competition advantages. ``Each and every 
one may look inward and consider how to benefit from industry or 
national advantages,'' he said. 
  ``We can react with calm to the German magazine DER 
SPIEGEL's 
recent attack on Finnish forestry, at least as long as the 
information is spread through pictures taken in Canada. We have 
at our disposal some solid weapons for a counterattack, when we 
consider that hardly any other country can manage its forest 
resources with the same competence as we, and major mistakes lie 
way back in time. The national economy should be given the 
opportunity to utilize the tax funds that have systematically 
been sunk into our forestry sector,'' said Ehrnrooth. 
  In domestic raw materials policies, Ehrnrooth still sees 
remnants of a closed economy. ``Slices from the national 
economic pie were amicably cut for milk production and stumpage. 
Such an interlinkage is not allowed anymore,'' he added. 
  ``The pricing of wood raw materials is a different story, 
and 
the producers are represented on the markets by a strong 
interest organization. It makes one wonder why anyone still 
gives it any credence, considering the bad advice it has 
dispensed to its members during the last few years,'' he noted. 
  ``It is not the first time that the Forestry Association, 
which is owned by the producers, is pushing for price increases 
in the entire field of wood products. It is difficult for me to 
understand why other companies would have to follow the Forestry 
Association's lead. I would imagine that, in the future, large 
forestry companies would deal directly with the forest owners. 
When lumber prices are increasing the way they are now, it 
should also be reflected in the stumpage prices. On the other 
hand, wood pulp prices are so low that it does not make sense to 
increase fiber prices,'' said Ehrnrooth. 
  ``The dual role of the Forestry Association has been subject 
for discussions as far back as I can remember. However, the fact 
is that the interests of the industry represented by the 
Forestry Association are quite similar to the rest of the 
industry. Luckily enough, the disagreements regarding raw 
materials do not dominate the whole field,'' Ehrnrooth added. 
  ``Instead of our returning to a policy of price 
recommendations, we should find other ways to peaceful 
solutions. My opinion is that, in a way, it is in society's 
interest that the wood does not rot in the forests. If we cannot 
reach an agreement on wood prices, we should consider, for 
example, the use of arbitration,'' he concluded.

<F P=106> [Article by Jukka Perttu: ``Finland Promises To Help </F>
Estonian Oil Cleanups''] 
  [Text] A bill has still not been issued for the Kihnu 
incident. 
  Finland supports Estonian oil cleanup efforts at sea. The 
environment ministers of both countries, Andres Tarand and Sirpa 
Pietikainen, agreed last Wednesday in Helsinki that Finland 
would support Estonian oil cleanup operations by offering, among 
other things, training, equipment, and expert help. Finland also 
agreed not to charge Estonia for all the costs involved in 
cleaning up after oil spills in Estonian waters. 
  The Finnish aid is financed by, among other things, adjacent 
area cooperation funds. 
  Finland intends to continue its support during a five-year 
transitional period, but the period may be extended, if 
necessary. 
  On the other hand, the permanent agreement signed by the 
environment ministers is based on equality, as each country is 
obligated to lend assistance in case of oil spills. The 
agreement provides the basis for cooperation between 
environmental protection authorities in case an oil spill 
accident happens in the Gulf of Finland. 
  Russian oil, for example, is exported through Estonian ports 
for foreign destinations. 
  Estonia's defenses against oil spills are still quite weak. 
The country has two vessels with oil recovery equipment. In 
addition, the Estonian Board of Navigation has ordered from 
Finland two 18-meter-long workboats. There is also some other 
oil spill equipment in the country. Senior inspector Olli 
Pahkala from the Ministry of the Environment said that the oil 
companies at the new oil terminal in Tallinn had acquired their 
own oil spill equipment. 
<H5>  Cooperation and Experiences </H5>
  The cooperation between Finland and Estonia was put to the 
test last January when the coastal tanker Kihnu leaked oil into 
the waters of Tallinn. Two oil cleanup vessels and a sea rescue 
helicopter were rushed from Finland to provide help. 
  Sources at the National Board of Waters and the Environment 
told us that a bill covering the expenses had not yet been sent 
to Kihnu's owners. The board has been unable to issue a bill as 
it has not yet, in its turn, received all the outstanding bills 
from other agencies that participated in the operation. 
<H5>  Tarand Thanked for the Help </H5>
  The ministers also signed a joint planning agreement and 
program for 1994. In addition, Tarand and Pietikainen have 
conducted negotiations regarding environmental cooperation 
between the two countries . 
  Tarand thanked for the help with a pleased smile: ``Of all 
environmental aid received by Estonia, about half has come from 
Finland.'' 
  Pietikainen, on her part, praised the Estonian efforts to 
protect its shores. The country's coastline has been protected 
from builders.

<F P=106> [Article by Sauli Korpimo: ``Health of Finnish Forests </F>
Declining, Every Fifth Tree Suffers From Needle Cast''] 
  [Text] The health of Finnish forests is getting worse 
again. Needle loss came to a halt a few years ago, but during 
the last two years it has increased again. Now, 20 percent of 
all trees suffer from needle loss. In general, forest growth is 
still satisfactory, although, in more sensitive areas, one can 
see various symptoms of stress on the trees. 
  Needle loss among Finnish conifers is average, based on 
European standards. In Finland and Sweden, between 10 and 20 
percent of all trees are damaged, and, for example, in Norway, 
Estonia, Germany, and Poland, the figure is 20 percent. The 
forests in Czechoslovakia are in the worst shape: Almost 60 
percent of the trees are damaged. 
  Needle loss is used as a measure of tree vitality, or, in 
other words, their ability to survive, grow, and produce seeds. 
A tree has suffered needle loss if it has lost more than 20 
percent of its needles, and it has been damaged if it has 
dropped 25 percent. 
  Researcher Martti Lindgren does not believe that air 
pollution has any significant effect on needle loss. In the 
southern parts of Finland, nitrogen and sulfur emissions have, 
in part, caused needle loss among pines. 
  ``Aside from areas in the vicinity of emission sources, 
densely populated areas, and roadside areas, needle loss is 
primarily caused by the aging of trees and by unfavorable 
climate and weather factors,'' said Lindgren. He spoke about 
needle loss studies at a research convention arranged by the 
Forest Research Institute in Vantaa. 
  The greatest needle loss has been suffered by conifers in 
Lapland. Also, spruce forests in Kainuu suffer from needle loss. 
Pine forests on the south coast and in Ostrobothnia have 
suffered more needle loss than in other parts of southern 
Finland. 
  Needle loss has been suffered by 38.5 percent of all spruce 
and 11.5 percent of all pine. The defoliation percentage for 
deciduous trees is 18.

Mercier: ``Nanofiltration: The Future of Water"''] 
  [Text] Nanofiltration is a membrane technique complying 
with a number of limitations, such as the erosion of resources, 
increasing demand, the safety of supply networks, and drinking 
water quality, while presenting more than one advantage. A 
prototype station is supplying the inhabitants of 
Auvers-sur-Oise. They are the first people to drink water 
treated by nanofiltration which is softened and has no taste of 
chlorine. 
  The development of membrane techniques, which made their 
first appearance in water treatment some 10 years ago, is based 
on various factors. These include increasingly severe 
legislation governing the quality of drinking water, the need to 
take into account any possible side effects of treatment due to 
the addition of reagents, the erosion of resources, and the 
technological progress made to make these processes competitive. 
  Nanofiltration, which bridges the gap between 
ultrafiltration 
and reverse osmosis, complies with the new standards for 
drinking water. It gives precise control over the quality of the 
water produced. Other points in its favor are its compactness 
and the simplicity with which it can be used, checked, and 
maintained. 
<H5>  The Membrane Barrier </H5>
  The term nanofiltration is used for membranes that have a 
molecular weight removal threshold for organic compounds of 
close to 250 daltons. This corresponds to the hypothetical 
existence of pores 1 nm in diameter. These composite-type 
membranes are formed of a hydrophobic support bearing positively 
charged hydrophilic chemical groups. In this way, the 
traditional properties of an ultrafiltration membrane are 
strengthened by a repulsive force enabling the removal of 
similarly charged ionic species and their counterions. It is 
these groups that are responsible for the ionic action of the 
nanofiltration membranes -- bivalent species are held back at a 
rate varying from 70-90 percent, making it an excellent process 
for water softening (the removal of Calcium, Ca 2+ 
[superscript], and magnesium, Mg 2+ [superscript], both 
responsible for water hardness) and desulfurization (removal of 
SO4 2- [superscript]), while the retention rate for monovalent 
ions is lower (less than 60%). 
<H5>  Less Chlorine in the Networks </H5>
  These membranes are also an excellent physical barrier to 
small dissolved molecules and micropollutants such as Atrazine. 
They are particularly effective at removing trihalomethane 
precursors and humic and fulvic acids. 
  Another aspect of nanofiltration membranes is their capacity 
to retain organic matter. They remove the dissolved 
biodegradable organic carbon which is the part of dissolved 
organic carbon that feeds the bacteria in supply networks. 
Removing it avoids the development of biofilms and therefore 
reduces the final rate of chlorination normally used to 
disinfect networks. 
  Lastly, these membranes operate at pressures of less than 10 
bars. They therefore couple the ionic advantages of reverse 
osmosis with the low operating pressures and consequently 
reduced energy consumption of ultrafiltration. 
<H5>  The Mery 400,000 Project </H5>
  The Ile-de-France water syndicate [SEDIF] supplies drinking 
water to 144 communes in the Paris region, representing four 
million inhabitants. It is continuing in its efforts to counter 
the erosion of resources and to conserve the same water quality 
throughout the supply network in a region of growing demand. 
This has already been achieved for the treatment processes in 
its two largest production plants at Neuilly-sur-Marne and 
Choisy-le-Roi (800,000 m3/day). 
  The Mery 400,000 project is the opportunity to research into 
both water production and distribution. At the suggestion of 
its administrator, the Compagnie Generale des Eaux [CGE], SEDIF 
has set itself the goal of increasing the capacity of the 
Mery-sur-Oise plant from 270,000 m3 to 400,000 m3 per day. Fed 
by the river Oise, this plant now treats water for 600,000 
inhabitants. The main stages in the treatment system are: 
preozonation and storage; coagulation and settling; biological 
sand filtration; ozonation and biological filtration on granular 
activated carbon; postozonation; and finally postchlorination 
before distribution. 
<H5>  Nanofiltration At Work </H5>
  After an initial study into the different processes that 
could be used to achieve this aim, SEDIF and CGE wanted to test 
nanofiltration by building a prototype plant with a capacity of 
2,800 m3/day on the Mery-sur-Oise site. 
  The membranes in nanofiltration are packed in spiral 
modules. 
This kind of module has a small dead zone and a relatively low 
investment cost. On the other hand, it is very sensitive to 
clogging and requires quite exhaustive pretreatment. Two sheets 
of membrane are placed on either side of a spacer material. The 
three sheets are sealed along three sides to form an envelope. 
The open side is attached to a perforated tube that collects 
the treated water. The envelope is then wrapped around the tube 
with a spacer generating turbulence on the concentrate side. 
The rolls of membrane are placed inside a pressure tube with a 
system of joints at either end ensuring its watertightness. In 
normal operation, the water to be treated circulates in the 
interstices formed by the spacer. Pressure forces some of the 
water to penetrate the inside of the envelope and to collect in 
the central tube. 
<H5>  Portrait of a Treatment System </H5>
  The use of membranes, the choice of operating conditions 
(pressure, tangential velocity, temperature, conversion level, 
etc.), and the correct match of pretreatment system to modules 
are all of vital importance if system performance is to be 
maintained for as long as possible. The stages in a 
nanofiltration treatment system are: pretreatment of the raw 
water (settling, sand filtration, and 5 5m safety prefilters); 
acid conditioning of the raw water to prevent the precipitation 
of carbonates and of calcium and magnesium hydroxides; 
conditioning by chelating agent for sulfate salts (CaSO2, etc.); 
pressurization using a pump; nanofiltration; post-treatment of 
the treated water, consisting of restoring the carbonate balance 
and, if necessary, remineralizing the raw water (often a simple 
aeration is sufficient); and final chlorination. 
  With a degree of economic and technological progress, we can 
envisage the chosen solution producing water with a very low 
dissolved, biodegradable organic matter content, and that is 
free from pathogens, and softened. This solution also makes it 
possible to reduce the number of treatment stages, since water 
polishing by nanofiltration replaces the stages of ozonation and 
biological filtration on granular activated carbon. 
<H5>  The Water at Auvers-sur-Oise </H5>
  Started up in July 1992, the nanofiltration prototype has 
been supplying the commune of Auvers-sur-Oise (6,000 
inhabitants) since February 1993, with the agreement of the 
health ministry and the French council for public hygiene. 
  The water entering the prototype still contains 3.6 mg/l of 
dissolved organic carbon, approximately one third of which (1.1 
mg/l) is biodegradable and could benefit the regrowth of 
bacteria in the distribution network. Its chlorine demand, in 
the region of three mg/l may lead to the formation of byproducts 
such as chloroform (CHCL3), trihalomethanes (THM), and total 
organohalogens (TOX). One half of the organic matter in the 
water supplying the prototype is composed of humic substances. 
The other major components are hydrophilic acids (30 percent), 
carboxylic acids (five to eight percent), and carbohydrates 
(five to ten percent). In addition, 75 percent of the dissolved 
organic carbon has a molecular weight of less than 5,000 
daltons, much of which (25 percent) has a molecular weight of 
less than 500 daltons. This justifies the use of nanofiltration 
membranes with a removal threshold in the order of 250 daltons. 
  The water produced after nanofiltration is of a very high 
quality. Ninety percent of the dissolved organic carbon is 
removed and the dissolved biodegradable organic carbon 
concentration is less than the detection limit (0.1 mg/l). The 
chlorine is no longer consumed by the organic matter and remains 
at a more stable level in the network. The two effects are 
complementary: the low concentration in biodegradable organic 
matter and the chlorine stability make it easier to protect the 
network against bacterial contamination. 
  It was possible to confirm this on the Auvers-sur-Oise 
distribution network which is supplied with nanofiltered water. 
A low residual chlorine level at the plant outlet (0.1 mg/l) 
was sufficient to keep the water within the bacteriological 
standards. 
  Nanofiltration is therefore considered a leading candidate 
for doubling the Mery-sur-Oise plant's capacity. It presents a 
number of advantages: the production of water free from 
pathogenic micro- organisms, a reduced level of dissolved 
biodegradable organic carbon, the notable possibility of 
reducing the level of chlorination before distribution and thus 
the production of water free from chlorination byproducts, the 
removal of micropollutants such as pesticides, and the reduction 
of bivalent ions (hardness and sulfates). The inhabitants of 
Auvers are the first European consumers of water produced using 
this innovative process. There is no doubt that it will find 
its place in modern water treatment systems.

<F P=106> [Article by Lutz Bloos: ``Large Outfits Play Monopoly in </F>
Waste Market''; [Subhead lines: ``Federal Monopolies Commission 
Criticizes Increasing Concentration Within Waste Management 
Sector''; ``Federal Association of German Waste Management 
Willing to Withdraw Again from DSD'']] 
  [Text] Hamburg, 22 October 1993 (VDI-N)--Is waste 
management henceforth only something for large outfits? Last 
Friday in Hamburg, the yearly meeting of the Federal Association 
of German Waste Management [BDE] focused on the concentration in 
the waste management sector and energy supply firms' commitment 
to this market. 
  There is more of a market for waste than ever before. 
Hellmut 
Trienekens, president of BDE, estimates that by the year 2005 
there will be surge in Germany's market from the current 
approximately DM75 billion to nearly DM200 billion. This 
includes building rubble, crushed road surface and industrial 
waste. 
  It is large companies that are increasingly engaged in this 
lucrative business. In the past, the monopolies commission, the 
top watchdog over the market economy and competition, repeatedly 
voiced sharp criticism of the process of concentration in the 
sector. The monopolies commission's president, Dieter Wolf, did 
not even refrain from criticism in Hamburg. According to Wolf, 
it is, above all, the activity of the large energy supply firms 
in taking over the numerous small and mid-size waste companies 
that constitutes a threat to competition. In Wolf's words: 
``More and more I get the impression that monopoly yields on the 
protected energy supply markets are henceforth being applied 
profitably to other markets.'' Hence, at present, of nearly 
1,000 waste management firms, only 10 large ones are getting 
half of the turnover in the waste management sector. Nor did 
Wolf spare criticism of environmental minister, Klaus Toepfer, 
who was in attendance and who previously had eloquently 
supported his recycling model. Wolf lamented: ``As early as the 
introduction of the packaging ordinance, many of the monopolies 
commission's misgivings were not taken into consideration.'' 
Without the restrictions on competition, it is impossible to 
give practical application to the ordinance. Accordingly, the 
Dual System Germany [DSD] is a demand monopoly. 
  Wolf was unable to recognize any kind of advantage compared 
to the government waste management monopoly that prevailed 
earlier. As a consequence, business is stocking almost 
exclusively products with the green dot. That is tantamount to a 
restriction on a company's freedom of organization since no 
merchant has any other choice should he be unwilling to take 
back the packaging himself. Wolf described this situation as 
``strictly prohibited under monopoly law.'' The monopolies 
commission president expressed it quite harshly: ``This kind of 
system passed on in the guise of civil law tends to exploit the 
citizenry.'' 
  For this reason the Federal Monopolies Office wants by all 
means to prevent energy supply companies from taking over the 
DSD. Solving DSD's financial crisis through waste management 
would entail heavy influence of waste managers. Not only their 
financial commitment but also the appointment of three DSD board 
members from waste management causes the monopolies commission 
to be mistrustful. 
  In any event, the BDE does not want to take over the DSD. At 
least that is what BDE president, Trienekens remarked. He is 
willing to give back his board mandate immediately, once the DSD 
regains its financial standing and waste managers' demands are 
satisfied. Frank-Rainer Billigmann, in charge at BDE 
headquarters, argued in a similar vein. Waste management's 
stabilization of the Dual System has ``helped'' Toepfer's 
recycling model ``to survive.'' Whereas he gave the 
environmental minister a hearty welcome, he greeted Dieter Wolf 
with a frosty: ``We are interested in seeing your report.'' 
Earlier he indirectly accused the monopolies commission of 
overstepping its jurisdiction in criticizing the DSD's personnel 
policy.

  [Text] By the end of 1992, there were 1,200 wind power 
installations in Germany. Rated output: 180 MW. Since 1974, the 
Federal Ministry for Research and Technology [FMRT] has promoted 
the use of wind energy, about 30 million marks are made 
available for this purpose annually. [This makes] a total of 
about 300 million German marks thus far--120 marks for large and 
100 for small and mid-size installations, the remainder for 
R&amp;D 
projects. Goals: acceptable costs for energy production with 
wind power, a noticeable contribution to the supply of 
electricity, reduction in energy imports, a broadening of the 
foundation of the energy supply, and a search for alternatives 
for the Third World. Through continued development in the 
technology of [wind power] installation, wind power generated 
current should become competitive by the end of the millennium. 
  Improvement in the technical availability of wind power 
installations is at the heart of the federal promotional program 
offered by the FMRT since 1989--``250 MW Wind.'' A good half of 
the installations within the scope of this program are operated 
by commercial enterprises, 30% by private investors, 
almost 
15% by farmers and 3.5% by local authorities and 
associations. 
Together with a scientific measurement and evaluation program 
(SMEP), the data from the promoted installations will be 
collected for ten years and evaluated. As an incentive for their 
participation in the general test, operators of the windmills 
will receive from the FMRT a subsidy of six to eight pfennigs 
per kWh, plus 16.6 pfennigs for wind power generated current. 
Because of this promotional program, in 1992 growth in wind 
power installations was for the first time greater in Germany 
than in Denmark, the European leader (320 MW from nearly 2,300 
installations). Worldwide about 2,300 MW are currently generated 
by from wind power. The USA has 15,000 wind installations with 
1,600 MW in operation. In the EC countries the wind capacity is 
currently about 1,000 MW. The EC demonstration program 
THERMIE--which runs from 1991 to 1994--places emphasis on those 
energy technologies which would counteract the looming 
greenhouse effect through a reduction in CO[.sup]2[/] 
emissions. It is supposed to promote the market introduction of 
improved energy technologies and encourage cooperation across 
[national] borders. The energy research program JOULE II (Joint 
Opportunities for Unconventional or Long Term Energy Supply) 
also runs until the end of 1994. Within the scope [of this 
program], a new generation of large wind turbines of optimal 
size and technology is supposed to be developed. Seven projects, 
two of them German, have gearless 1 MW installations as their 
goal.

<F P=106> [Report by Andreas Forster: ``Was a Skillful Game of </F>
Confusion Staged Concerning 41 Barrels With Poison From 
Seveso?''] 
  [Text] Documents that are available to BERLINER ZEITUNG 
show that at least 47 tonnes of dioxin-containing waste from 
Seveso were stored at the special waste dump in Schoenberg in 
Mecklenburg. 
  The quarrel over the poisonous barrels from Seveso 
dramatically exacerbated once again in Schwerin last Friday [14 
January]. At a mammoth meeting, at which 20 witnesses were 
heard, the members of the Schoenberg investigation committee 
wanted to finally clarify the question as to whether dioxin 
waste from the Italian town of Seveso reached the waste dump in 
Mecklenburg or not. 
  The atmosphere became solemn when the representative of the 
Swiss chemical concern, Hoffmann LaRoche, to which the Seveso 
factory ICMESA [expansion unknown] belonged, raised his hand to 
swear an oath. The 41 barrels with the deadly poison were 
incinerated in his presence in Basel in 1985. Thus, they can 
never have been buried at the Schoenberg dump ground, Heinz 
Hollinger, who is responsible for environmental protection at 
Hoffmann LaRoche, swore. 
  Belgian member of the European Parliament Paul Staes, from 
the group of the Greens, and his aide, the spokesman of the 
Greens in Luebeck, Guenter Wosnitza, presented a chain of 
evidence based on statements of eyewitnesses and hints in 
documents. Staes remembered documents from the Environment 
Ministry of the former German Democratic Republic [GDR] that he 
saw in 1990. They showed that the dioxin-containing waste from 
Seveso really did reach Schoenberg. Yet Staes was not able to 
present a single document proving the transportation or the 
storage in Schoenberg. 
  BERLINER ZEITUNG is now able to furnish this document. It 
has received documents from the former GDR Environment Ministry 
on the basis of which it can be proven for the first time that 
poison from Seveso did arrive in Schoenberg after all and that 
even more arrived than the supposed 6.5 tonnes of reactor waste 
in 41 barrels. 
  In January 1982, the Mannesmann Italia company, a subsidiary 
of the Mannesmann concern in Germany, inquired with the German 
authorities whether it was possible to store a larger quantity 
of waste at the Mecklenburg dump. It claimed that metal parts 
contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachloride benzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 
the most poisonous dioxin, were involved. Even the smallest 
dose of TCDD may cause genetic deviations over several 
generations. 
  The inquiry from the Italian Mannesmann company was 
registered under number I (for Italy) 18/82. ``Seveso/Italy'' 
was mentioned as the producer of waste. 
  On 3 March 1982, the supervisory commission of the special 
waste dump rejected the Mannesmann inquiry I 18/82, giving the 
following reason: Waste from ``well-known poison scandals..., 
Seveso, for example,'' will not be stored in Schoenberg. Thus, 
officially, the GDR was no longer involved in the deal with the 
Seveso waste. Internally, however, order I 18/82 was carried 
out, as documents have now proven. 
  In a ``list of wastes'' that arrived at Schoenberg between 
the establishment of the waste dump and 30 September 1985, the 
rejected Mannesmann order is also mentioned. Under ``waste 
group 6 -- other wastes,'' I 18/82 mentions the delivery of 
calcium chloride residues. Total quantity: 47.482 tonnes. 
  Thus, it is clear that the Mannesmann company that was 
ordered to eliminate the hazardous waste from Seveso finally 
reached agreement on the deal with the GDR side. 
  To cover their tracks, the officials responsible for the 
waste dump simply declared the contents of the poisonous 
delivery wrongly. it is not known whether they stored the 
wrongly declared dioxin waste in a ``poison bunker'' or whether 
they simply dumped the dangerous material somewhere in the waste 
dump to cover up the affair. 
  Another suspicion has not been dispelled: More poisonous 
waste transports from Italy for which inquiries were sent as 
early as in 1982 arrived until 30 September 1985. In three 
cases, they were declared as mercury-containing by-products and 
in one case as methyl metal chrylat residues. Were these 
deliveries also declared wrongly? 
The documents from the GDR Environment Ministry available to 
BERLINER ZEITUNG also make the game of confusion concerning the 
41 Seveso barrels that has lasted for 10 years appear in a new 
light. It seems to become finally clear what the barrel 
operation really might have been -- a gigantic diversion. 
Bernard Paringaux, the French specialist for waste disposal and 
one of the key actors in the barrel comedy, confirmed the 
following to European Parliament member Staes. ``Most of the 
Seveso poison went somewhere else. The responsible officials 
wanted to direct the whole attention of the press and the public 
to the 41 barrels, which they really achieved,'' Paringaux told 
Staes. 
  The spectacle for the media had the required effect. Whereas 
the world speculated about the background to the mysterious 
story and the authenticity of the barrels that had disappeared, 
the transportation of the major part of the poisonous Seveso 
waste was arranged in Milan. 
  An internal communication from Paringaux' company Wadir to 
Mannesmann Italia reads: ``When the first part will have been 
shipped, we will meet in Milan where you can determine the 
modalities and the dates for the disassembly and the 
transportation of the last parts with Mr. Paringaux.'' The 
``final removal is estimated to involve approximately 150 
tonnes.'' 
  The question as to why the entire show concerning the Seveso 
poison was staged with international participation has not yet 
been answered. One possible reason might be that a much larger 
quantity of highly toxic substances resulted from the accident 
at the ICMESA company than has so far been admitted. 
  However, this would only be possible if something other than 
the harmless trichlorophenol was produced over the weekend 
during the mysterious special shift when the grave disaster 
occurred. 
  According to Paul Staes, reports by eyewitnesses support 
this 
theory. They mention a much higher working temperature of the 
reactor than would have been required for the production of 
trichlorophenol. A scientist who visited the factory after the 
accident discovered a second secret production room behind the 
reactor that caused the damage, in which barrels were filled 
with chemicals. 
  According to Staes' theory, a highly poisonous herbicide 
containing various dioxins was produced for military purposes in 
Seveso. Thus, a much larger quantity of toxic waste resulted 
from the accident than the officially admitted 6.5 tonnes. 
  The official quantity that was filled in 41 barrels 
according 
to the rules might have been incinerated in Switzerland in 1985 
to calm the public down. However, the scaring conclusion of 
this version might be that not only the approximately 50 tonnes 
of the deadly substances but twice as much might be stored in 
Schoenberg.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: ``Flight Reaction Indicates </F>
Impurities--Berlin Testing Procedure Uses Ciliates for Detecting 
Toxicologic Substances''] 
  [Text] Ciliates can detect and avoid toxic substances. This 
behavior called chemotaxis can be used for the detection of 
toxic substances in contaminated water. Based on this 
observation, scientists at the Free University of Berlin 
(Institut fuer Biochemie, AG Oekotoxikologie, E hrenbergstr. 
26-28, 14195 Berlin) developed a testing system for toxic 
compounds dissolved in water. Preliminary studies showed that 
the system containing the ciliate tetrahymena thermophilia is 
versatile and sensitive. 
  As the scientists in Berlin report, the toxic substances 
cause typical flight and evasive actions. The extent of the 
reaction depends on the substance concentration. Tetrahymenia is 
suitable as a testing organism because it is an intermediate 
step between bacteria and higher organisms both biologically and 
ecologically. It plays an important role in the food chains in 
water. The biochemistry and physiology of the organism has been 
studied thoroughly. 
  The ciliate is used in three different test formats in 
Berlin. The testing apparatus basically consists of an outer 
chamber, into which an internal chamber consisting of 18 
measuring tubes is inserted. The measuring tubes are connected 
with the outer chamber by fine channels. 
  In the initial test phase, the organisms are in the outer 
chamber. The test sample is in the measuring tubes. If they 
contain toxic substances, the ciliates avoid the tubes, 
otherwise they spread to both chambers. The measured value is 
the number of organisms which entered the tubes. 
  Anot her test measures how the growth of tetrahymena is 
inhibited when agents are added. However, this test is 
considerably less sensitive than the chemosensory test. The 
change in the membrane potential due to water contamination can 
be studied using fluorescent compounds; the sensitivity of this 
test is supposed to be similar to that of the chemosensory 
process. 
  In studies with chemical substances which were selected 
randomly from the ``European Inventory of Existing Chemicals'' 
the test had a broad range and high sensitivity. However, the 
method is not suitable for continuous monitoring of the water 
quality.

<F P=106> [Article by Ursula-Schiele-Trauth: ``Brussels Willing to </F>
Muddy the Water''; [Subhead lines: ``EC Anti-Pollution 
Guidelines for Water Facing Amendment''; ``In Actuality, Tighter 
Pesticide Limits for Drinking Water Hardly Observed'']] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 22 October 1993 (VDI-N)--Currently, the 
European Community's [EC] drinking water is safeguarded by quite 
stringent environmental standards. In reality, however, the 
limits on pesticides or heavy metals are observed only 
infrequently. It is the desire of the EC Commission to ease the 
requirements by amending the 1994 guidelines. The nub of the 
debate is the stringent limit on pesticides. The EC guideline 
laid down over a decade ago allows a maximum of 0.1 g (one 
microgram = one millionth of a gram) of a single pesticide per 
liter of drinking water. If a number of substances are present 
simultaneously, the total pollution should not exceed 0.5 
/l. 
In the final analysis, that value implies that should not be any 
pesticides at all in drinking water, since even using the most 
up-to-date methods, it is impossible to detect anything less. 
  Even in West Germany this stringent limit has not been 
upheld 
for a long time by all waterworks. And that is even more so the 
case in other EC countries. Additionally, Bonn's Federal 
Association of German Gas and Water Works [BGW] classifies ``as 
serious'' the number of times the limit is overstepped in the 
new federal states. DM27 billion is the estimated cost of needed 
rehabilitation measures in this area. 
  The EC is now deliberating amending the drinking water 
guideline and likewise the anti-pollution guidelines for lakes, 
rivers and canals. The controversial opinions of the different 
interest groups surfaced at an experts meeting at the end of 
September in Brussels. Environmentalist groups and broad 
segments of the water industry want not only to uphold the 
stringent limits but also to apply them to ground water and 
surface waters. Contrariwise, some member states, farmers and 
manufacturers of pesticides consider the standard unrealistic. 
  In the future, the Commission is calling for accurate cost 
estimates for safeguard measures in order to assess whether the 
expense is still in a tenable ratio to the resulting benefits. 
Dr. Hans-Gerd Nolting of the Federal Biological Institute in 
Braunschweig summarized the results of the conference thus: 
``The stringent parameters for pesticides can be altered without 
thereby scaling back health safeguards.'' 
  It is the view of a number of observers that the total 
parameter of 0.5 g/l for all pesticides will probably come 
down. The value for individual pesticides is disputed since it 
is valid only as a precautionary value. If it is overstepped, 
that still does not constitute any threat to the health of 
consumers. The EC drinking water guideline hews to the values 
proposed by the World Health Organization [WHO] for substances 
contained in water such as arsenic, chlorine or chlorinated 
hydrocarbons. This is the principle that the Frankfurt Farm 
Industry Association [IVA], representing pesticide manufacturers 
in the Federal Republic, is advocating also for pesticides. For 
the WHO's standard values are predicated on the quantities of 
each substance that pose no human health risk, based on current 
knowledge, to even infants or sick people, even if consumed 
daily for an entire lifetime. Practically speaking, that means 
different limits for individual pesticides. In the interim, the 
WHO has proposed such standard values for a number of pesticides 
that are currently in use. They are very distinct for the 
individual substances and are 10 to 20 thousand times the 
current EC rate limits. 
  In the opinion of environmentalist groups, while such WHO 
values may avoid harm to health, they still do not make any 
allowance for ecology. Peter Kleemeyer, spokesman for the WWF 
Germany environmental foundation, tosses out for consideration: 
``It is often only after many years that undesirable side 
effects show up.'' Too little is still known about the 
interactions of the by-products of the substances. Besides, 
higher limits for drinking water would inevitably facilitate an 
accumulation of pesticides in untreated waters. 
  Environmentalists are calling for an agriculture that 
systematically scales back the use of pesticides. Kleemeyer 
points to the Swedish model: ``Since 1986 they have succeeded 
there in cutting the use of substances by 65 percent and, in 
fact, without loss of yields.'' In West Germany too, the use of 
pesticides is waning, according to the IVA, by one third per 
hectare since 1989. 
  Water supply companies are calling for limits on pesticides 
in ground and surface waters. For them, it is a dilemma that, 
while there are stringent values for drinking water, there are 
only inadequate requirements for protecting rivers, lakes and 
canals. As BGW vice-president, Dr. Friedel Baurichter, remarks: 
``Pollutants have a cumulative effect on water prices.'' The 
price of water has soared by nearly 20 percent in the past three 
years in the former federal states. In the new federal states, 
meanwhile, prices have already risen tenfold because of the 
rehabilitation measures that have been introduced. 
  Also of concern to the BGW are the EC Commission's proposals 
for the authorization of pesticides. Products that have meantime 
been banned in the Federal Republic are on the list proposed for 
EC-wide marketing: Atrazin, Simazin, Lindan, etc. Supposedly 
also, approval will be given even to substances for which there 
is still no analytical method of detection. Since 1987, when the 
pesticide law took effect, that has been the pre-requirement for 
approval in the Federal Republic. Nolting observes: ``The 
Federal Biological Institute no longer gives approval for 
pesticides if values exceeding 0.1 g/l can be expected from 
the substances themselves or from problematical by-products.'' 
  The EC Commission is presently deliberating tougher limits 
for lead contents in drinking water from the current 50 g/l 
to 10 g/l. In this case it will follow the recently 
established recommendations of the WHO. At present, in the 
Federal Republic, critical lead values can still be anticipated 
only in old dwellings where no one has bothered to replace the 
lead pipes. In the meanwhile, the lead pipes up to the house 
connection have been replaced area-wide. The decisions of the EC 
Commission and the establishment of the new limits will come 
about at the start of the new year at the earliest.

  [Text] All over the world, great efforts are being made in 
various directions to make wider use of solar power. In 
addition to solar heat collectors, which are primarily used to 
heat water, solar cells also make it possible to generate 
electrical current directly from sunlight (photovoltaics). 
Photovoltaics is already being widely used to generate 
electricity in remote areas and for small- scale applications in 
appliances. Photovoltaics is also being used in numerous 
demonstration plants in conjunction with mains electricity. The 
electricity from main-connected photovoltaic systems still costs 
about 10 times as much as conventionally generated mains 
electricity. Of the several approaches being explored in an 
attempt to lower the cost of photovoltaics, it is considered 
that the scientific quest for more effective solar cell 
materials and the development of cheaper production methods hold 
out the best prospects. High-absorption thin-film solar cells 
and novel production processes involving cost-saving material 
deposition onto a substrate take on particular significance in 
this respect. The Berlin-based Hahn-Meitner Institute, working 
with the University of Stuttgart's Institute of Physical 
Electronics, has recently achieved a significant improvement in 
efficiency in a thin-film solar cell made of copper, indium, and 
sulfur. This sulfurous material is largely 
environment-compatible. The efficiency of this novel solar cell 
was raised to 10.2 percent -- in natural daylight and without 
further optimization in the form of, for example, an 
antireflection coating. 
  This material's theoretical efficiency exceeds the maximum 
performance of silicon. The thickness of the absorber layer, 
which has a direct bearing on production costs, needs to be only 
three-thousandths of a millimeter, so copper-indium disulfide 
has great development potential. It was possible to raise the 
degree of efficiency in the new cells because the vapor 
deposition process produces copper-rich photoactive material 
with a high sulfur surplus. An improved ``window material'' 
used as a transparent, conductive contact layer also contributed 
to this positive result.

  [Text] Next year the Netherlands will have a National 
Bureau for Wind Energy. This independent institution will 
promote the application of wind energy and provide scientific 
information. A location for the bureau has not yet been 
decided. The initiative comes from the Organization for Lasting 
Energy [ODE], the Netherlands Association for Wind Energy 
[Newin], and the Netherlands Energy and the Environment Company 
[Novem]. ``The Bureau should partly assume the work which was 
formerly done by Newin and ODE separately,'' says Mirjam Tielen, 
staff member from ODE. Novem, together with industry, supplies 
the funding of the bureau.

<F P=106> [Article by Theo Westerwoudt: ``Netherlands Helps Bulgaria </F>
Solve its Energy and Environmental Problems''] 
  [Excerpts] Zoetermeer -- ``The Netherlands is aiding us 
with technology and with major showcase projects that are 
helping us to solve our energy and environmental problems,'' 
says Bulgarian Deputy Environment Minister Evgeni Angelov 
enthusiastically. ``I am extremely grateful for this 
cooperation.'' 
  Angelov is visiting Energy &amp; Environment Netherlands 
(E&amp;EN) 
in Zoetermeer, the organization set up two years ago to help 
Netherlands companies secure contracts within the context of aid 
for Central and Eastern Europe. Over the past few days, he has 
established contacts for projects concerned with the improvement 
of gas supplies, the generation of electricity, coal 
vaporization, the cleaner combustion of lignite, and 
technological training in his country. 
  Bulgaria relies heavily on Russian supplies of natural gas, 
nuclear energy, and lignite for its energy requirements. 
Lignite is the only energy source that is amply available in 
Bulgaria, but the processing and combustion thereof cause 
tremendous environmental pollution, forming dust and emitting 
sulfur into the atmosphere. Consequently, Deputy Minister 
Angelov is enthusiastic about the new technology that the 
Rotterdam-based company Ecofire is implementing at a lignite 
mine to the northwest of Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, following 
arbitration by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and E&amp;EN. 
``The 
pilot project that Ecofire is putting into practice in 
conjunction with us is working superbly. I hope that it will 
rapidly be extended on a commercial scale, because we want to 
comply with Western environmental standards as soon as 
possible.'' [passage omitted] 
  Over the past few days, Angelov has also signed a contract 
with several Netherlands companies covering technological 
training for Bulgarians who are going to set up a gas 
distribution system in his country. A next step, which could 
also mean orders for the Netherlands, will involve the 
construction of pipelines, control equipment, pumps, and 
compressors. The engineer Hans de Ruiter, the CEO of E&amp;EN, 
believes that Netherlands energy companies like Gasunie, and the 
major distribution companies in this sector can do far more to 
conquer a share of the East European market. ``Look at what 
British Gas, Gaz de France, and German companies are doing in 
Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. They pay for the first 
feasibility studies and then receive contracts as a matter of 
course.'' De Ruiter believes that the shareholders of Gasunie 
-- Shell and Esso -- are clinging to the brakes. As a result, 
the ideal envisioned by Prime Minister Lubbers, who saw a 
leading role being set aside for Netherlands companies with his 
energy plan for Eastern Europe, is only materializing slowly. 
  Probably together with the Delft-based company Hagoort, 
Gasunie will advise Bulgaria on the storage of natural gas in an 
empty gas field to the north of Sofia. Bulgaria urgently needs 
a buffer of this kind, because the supply of Russian gas is 
being interrupted due to technical or political problems.

  [Text] The Hague, Jan 20 (AFP) -- A French container ship 
has been seized and its owners asked to pay $2.6 million 
compensation after thousands of sachets of toxic pesticide were 
washed up on Dutch beaches, officials said Thursday [20 January]. 
  Transport ministry officials said the French-registered 
Sherbro (eds: correct) had been docked at Amsterdam since 
Wednesday evening following the discovery of the sachets during 
the day Wednesday. 
  The sachets, which the ministry said were lost overboard in 
December, contained two highly toxic agricultural fungicides. 
The substances can be fatal if inhaled or ingested and can 
seriously damage the eyes in case of contact. 
  A ministry spokesman said the Sherbro was identified with 
the 
help of the Lloyd's register of ships. The Sherbro is owned by 
SCAC Delmas-Vieljeux, based in Dunkirk, and is insured by the 
British company P and I. 
  The Sherbro lost 88 containers containing 500,000 sachets 
last December 8 and 9, while weathering an overnight storm off 
the French coast. Thousands of sachets have already been washed 
up on French and Belgian beaches. 
  Delmas's representative here said the ministry was claiming 
five million florins (about $2.6 million) in compensation to pay 
for the clean up operation. 
  The worst of the pollution discovered Wednesday occurred 
near 
Amsterdam, the ministry said. Most beaches along the Dutch 
coast were affected but most of the sachets were found at Velsen 
and Ijmuiden near Amsterdam. 
  Police sealed off the beaches on Wednesday night and 
clean-up 
teams, equipped with protective clothing and goggles, began 
cleaning up the beaches on Thursday morning. 
  In some spots there were six sachets per square meter 
(yard), 
the ministry spokesman said. 
  Clean up work should take two days, the spokesman said, 
declining to estimate the cost. He added that two cigarette-box 
size objects had also been found near Amsterdam, also from the 
Sherbro. 
  They were being investigated to determine whether they were 
detonators, he said. 
  The Dutch subsidiary of Swiss chemicals giant Ciba-Geigy 
offered to cooperate in the operation, offering to transport the 
recovered sachets and dispose of them in a specialised plant 
near Rotterdam. 
  It said it too would seek payment for its services from the 
container ship's owners, or their insurers.

<F P=106> [Article by Bart Stam: ``Heemstede Is Experimental Garden </F>
For Biological Water Purification''] 
  [Text] Heemstede -- After three years' research, the 
Hoogheem council of the Rijnland area regards the time ripe for 
the introduction of a new water purification technology. This 
will take place in Heemstede, where phosphates will be removed 
from the water using a combination of biological 
dephosphatization and a granular reactor. The equipment will 
cost 7 million guilders to install. 
  The Heemstede Water Purification Plant (AWZI) is a 
demonstration model. Should the test unit meet expectations, 
then the Hoogheem council is considering building more of these 
dephosphatization plants. ``That depends on the experience we 
build up in Heemstede over the coming year,'' says P. Knaapen, 
head of Rijnland's purification technique department in Leiden. 
``We are checking whether it meets expectations with regard to 
phosphate purification. And we are also taking account of 
aspects like control, maintenance and the definitive size.'' 
The Heemstede unit is based on a scale model which Rijnland has 
tested since 1990 in three water purification plants. This 
mini-plant can be transported in a container. In 
Zuid-Kennemerland it is the first time that the purification 
method will be used at real size. 
<H5>  Algae Growth </H5>
  When phosphates enter water, they cause an increase in the 
number of nutrients in the water (eutrophication). This in turn 
causes a massive growth in algae, so that the amount of oxygen 
in the water declines. The main sources of phosphates in water 
are households (kitchen waste and feces) and agriculture 
(fertilizers). The contribution caused by washing powders is 
declining because many manufacturers have switched to 
phosphate-free products. 
  The AWZI in Heemstede already had a biological purification 
process. However, the equipment to remove the phosphate from 
the mass of bacteria -- the purification sediment -- is a new 
element. Its main advantage is that it does not increase the 
quantity of purification sediment. When oxygen is added, the 
micro-organisms absorb the phosphates. Rijnland continually 
separates off part of the sediment and adds acetic acid. While 
the bacteria absorb the acid as nutrients, they give off the 
phosphate again. This leads to water which is rich in 
phosphates and sediment which contains virtually none. 
  The next step is separating sediment and water. The Hoogheem 
council has chosen a centrifuge to do this. After the 
separation process, the sediment returns to its own purification 
process to once again absorb phosphates. At this stage the 
effluent contains virtually no phosphates. On the other hand 
the phosphate-rich water from the centrifuge must undergo two 
more processing stages. 
  The first processing stage is the addition of sulfuric acid 
to the water. This removes the carbonate from the water. This 
is necessary because this substance can block the following 
phase of the process, the granular reactor. The granular 
reactor was developed by the DHV engineering company in 
Amersfoort and enjoys an international reputation. 
<H5>  Large Granules </H5>
  Once the water has been pumped into the granular reactor, 
limewater is added to the centrifuge effluent. A deposit of 
calcium phosphate then forms from the limemilk and phosphate. 
The water goes from the bottom to the top of the reactor 
several times. The granular reactor contains grafting sand. 
The calcium phosphate attaches itself to the grafting sand and 
forms phosphate granules. The result is obvious: the granules 
become bigger and eventually drop to the bottom due to their 
weight. Here they are removed. The purified water is returned 
to the oxygenation tank. 
  The AWZI in Heemstede is one of 45 water purification plants 
in Rijnland. The aim of the plant is to help the Hoogheem 
council in the fight against phosphate. Rijnland calculates 
that in 1995 it will have to process some 900 tonnes of 
phosphates. This figure is based on the assumption that there 
are no increases in phosphate use.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: ``SFT Fears Hidden Environmental </F>
Catastrophe''] 
  [Text] Norway's Pollution Authority [SFT] fears that the 
tolerance threshold for environmental toxins will soon be 
reached in Norway. 
  ``We are concerned. There are enormous gaps in our knowledge 
about the effects of environmental toxins. We know they are 
extremely toxic even in small quantities and that they become 
concentrated in the food chain and in nature because they fail 
to break down,'' said SFT Director Harald Rensvik. 
  Yesterday SFT published its new comprehensive report on 
environmental toxins in Norway. The previous one came out six 
years ago. 
  The main conclusions are clear: Norwegian emissions have 
been 
radically reduced since 1985. In the case of many environmental 
toxins, industrial spillage into the waterways has been reduced 
by more than 90 percent. Nevertheless, environmental toxins 
are a greater threat to nature and the health of Norwegians than 
ever before. The problem is that, once emitted, pollutants 
remain in nature, and with the constant influx of toxins from 
abroad, environmental authorities fear that the tolerance 
threshold will soon be reached. Although unable to predict what 
will happen, where it will happen, or when, environmental 
authorities know that serious environmental problems are 
developing in the natural world around us. 
  We receive greater quantities of many of the most dangerous 
environmental toxins from abroad than we produce ourselves. The 
major portion is carried on the air and wind from power plants 
and industries on the continent. Some also come on the ocean 
currents. 
  ``Approximately four tons of cadmium is dumped on the 
Norwegian environment each year. Three of these come from other 
countries, while our own emissions account for just one ton. The 
proportions are similar for other toxins,'' said Rensvik. 
  SFT says in its report that the work of reducing Norwegian 
emissions must continue. ``We used the easiest and cheapest 
methods. The percentage that remains must also be eliminated if 
the fjords and nature areas ruined by Norwegian pollution are to 
be completely restored. There is still a long way to go before 
crabs can be fished out of the Frie Fjord. But it is entirely 
within the realm of possibility to get there,'' Rensvik said. 
  While most Norwegian toxic waste has a concrete source that 
can be identified and cleaned up, it is harder in the case of 
foreign pollutants. Norwegian pollutants harm one end of a fjord 
or the flora and fauna of a limited region. Pollutants from 
abroad are spread over the entire country by means of rain, 
wind, and ocean currents. This means that the authorities have 
limited knowledge of how long it will be until nature's 
tolerance threshold is reached: 
  ``In terms of climate, the Norwegian environment is in grave 
trouble. We fear that unforeseen harm can arise as a result of 
constantly increasing amounts of cadmium, mercury, and other 
environmental toxins that are out there,'' said Rensvik. 
  The director of SFT points out that scientists know too 
little to say what will happen on the day the tolerance 
threshold is exceeded. But Rensvik can mention several 
possibilities: severe poisoning, species that become extinct, 
species that have problems with reproduction, mutations, injury 
to the nervous system. Because substances are concentrated in 
the food chain, they can affect people through eating such 
things as reindeer meat. 
  ``We conclude that Norway must continue to work for further 
reductions both at home and abroad. Because even though our own 
emissions have been cut down, the danger to Norway's natural 
resources has not been dramatically reduced,'' said Rensvik. 
  The report reveals that scientists have discovered 
disturbing 
amounts of the environmental toxins PCB [polychlorinated 
biphenyl] and PAH [expansion unknown] in the Skagerrak trough 
and the Norwegian channels, in addition to the known quantities 
of imported pollutants. Recent investigations have also 
evidenced high concentrations of PCB's in the fatty tissues of 
polar bears and Arctic foxes on Spitzbergen. It is believed that 
PCB's can lead to a reduced capacity to breed, a weakened immune 
system, and behavioral disturbances--especially in sea mammals. 
The toxins congregate far from the source, and the effects of 
this are unclear. 
  The reason why advisories have been issued to those who eat 
fish and shellfish caught in the fjords is because of earlier 
toxin emissions from Norwegian industries. For some of these 
fjords, the restrictions have been reduced. In the meantime, 
they have been expanded somewhat in other areas because new and 
better studies have been done.

<F P=106> [Morten Fyhn report: ``Warm Defense of Whaling''] </F>
  [Text] Strasbourg -- Yesterday Gro Harlem Brundtland 
defended Norwegian whaling in a heated showdown with opponents 
in the European Parliament. 
  ``There is a logic in our arguments, and that is something 
that they must understand,'' a pugnacious Norwegian prime 
minister said after a short and intense debate with the many 
friends of the minke whale at an open meeting with the European 
Parliament. But the Members of the European Parliament [MEPs] 
did not allow themselves to be convinced in any way by Norway's 
well known scientific arguments regarding whaling. For them 
this is and remains a question of emotions and morals. 
  Whaling became a central topic when the MEPs were able to 
put 
questions. But none of them threatened to vote against 
Norwegian EU [European Union] membership if hunting of the minke 
whale continues. On the contrary, a large number of the critics 
of whaling said that they would very much like to have Norway as 
a member of the EU. 
  The parliament's criticism of whaling was chiefly voiced by 
British animal lovers -- both Conservative and socialist. 
  Norwegian seal hunting is also a popular hate issue in 
Strasbourg, and several MEP's mentioned the use of clubs on 
innocent seal cubs. Nor could they understand why Norway wants 
to sell sealskins. 
  Prime Minister Harlem Brundtland was both well prepared and 
ready for action yesterday. She lectured the gathering on what 
will happen if we start to make emotions instead of scientific 
arguments the basis for international decisions on the 
defensible management of animal species. She admitted that it 
would be much more pleasant for Norway to give in, but made it 
clear that there can be no question of this. 
  ``And why do we want to sell sealskin? Because we believe 
that we have a logical and a good ecological policy,'' she said. 
However, the prime minister seemed to be hinting that this is a 
demand that Norway could give way on in the negotiations with 
the EU: ``We will have to wait and see what we can achieve,'' 
she said. 
  In her introductory remarks to the MEP's the prime minister 
gave a detailed account of why Norway has applied for EU 
membership. She assured them that Norway is working hard to be 
able to complete the negotiations before the March deadline that 
has been set so that the European Parliament will be able to 
debate and vote on the outcome of the negotiations in May, and 
said that after that Norway will need five to six months to 
prepared a referendum.

<F P=106> [Article by Isabel Fernandez: ``Firm in Mejorada Begins </F>
Pilot Experiment To Recycle Cars''; introductory paragraph in 
boldface as published] 
  [Text] Mejorada del Campo--The municipality of 
Mejorada del Campo is home to the only firm in Spain that 
completely recycles automobiles. The pilot experiment, which 
began three months ago, consists of cannibalizing every 
component from tires to steering wheel while eliminating 
polluting materials. The firm doing the work is thereby 
achieving one of the goals of the National Automobile 
Manufacturers Association. 
  ``The experiment is turning out to be more worthwhile than 
expected and less expensive than predicted,'' says Jorge Aladro, 
coordinator of the system at the Reyfra (Recycling and Wrecking) 
firm in Mejorada del Campo (population 16,000). 
  It is estimated that from 700,000 to 800,000 vehicles are 
scrapped every year in our country. After being stripped of 
their marketable parts and components, those vehicles undergo a 
partial recycling process that leaves behind a large amount of 
scrap, with the further difficulty that since the vehicle was 
not decontaminated first, it becomes a source of pollution. 
  The complete recycling of automobiles that is now being 
offered includes the stages of collection, decontamination, 
disassembly, and crushing. Each of those stages has in view 
certain objectives which, depending on economic profitability 
and technical possibilities, may or may not be incorporated into 
future practice and habits. 
  For example, a basic feature of the first phase is the 
establishment of an automobile collection system that will 
eliminate the current practice of removing cars after they have 
been crushed, since that makes it impossible to extract various 
usable components. 
  To begin with, it will be necessary to adopt regulations 
requiring that the final owner turn in his vehicle at one of a 
number of specific locations. Those locations will be the only 
ones authorized to issue the ``delivery certificate'' enabling 
the owner to stop paying taxes on the car. 
  Aladro says that for decontamination, Reyfra ``uses a system 
never before seen in Spain: one that eliminates the pollutants 
(oils, brake fluid, CFC's, and so on) and keeps them from 
entering the atmosphere. Those pollutants are then recycled or 
processed by authorized agents.'' 
  Once decontaminated, the vehicle enters the disassembly 
phase. The glass could be reused, resulting in an estimated 
savings of 130 kg of fuel oil per metric ton of recycled glass. 
  The sulfuric acid from batteries is converted into lead-free 
calcium sulfate, thus becoming a nonpolluting waste product. 
  The scrap, with the acid removed, is broken down into its 
component parts by crushing. The final result is inert slag and 
lead that is pure enough to enter the production cycle of that 
metal. 
  Lastly, the car is broken up and the various metals are 
separated and sent to the steel industry for reuse. 
  This pilot experiment differs from those carried out in 
Europe in that it is the first to include all automobile 
manufacturers and has the cooperation of associations in that 
industry. Those associations are very necessary, since the 
networks for reuse and marketing depend upon them.

  [Excerpt] The Government is facing a testing scrutiny over 
its environmental policies with the setting up of a new 
committee by the House of Lords to monitor its strategies for 
``sustainable development,'' writes Greg Neale, 
Environment Correspondent. 
  The Lords is to set up the ad hoc committee in the New Year. 
It will have as its remit to consider the Government's report to 
the United Nations--due by the end of the year, but not now 
expected to be published until mid-January--on its strategies 
for making economic development environmentally sustainable. 
  The new Lords committee, with powers to call for evidence 
from across the range of Government departments, is likely to 
give a close scrutiny to ministers' plans. Several leading 
members of the Upper House are keenly interested in the topic 
and are expected to home in on any policy inconsistencies 
between departments. 
  The concept of sustainable development has become a 
blueprint 
in recent years in international circles. The Bruntland report, 
prepared by the 1987 World Commission on Environment and 
Development, chaired by the Norwegian Prime Minister, Mrs. Gro 
Harlem Bruntland, defined the concept as ``development that 
meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability 
of future generations to meet their own needs.'' 
  The policy attempts to integrate concern for industrial and 
economic development, particularly in the Third World, with the 
need to care for the environment. It therefore links government 
and intergovernmental strategies on such topics as economics, 
transport, trade, energy and industry with issues such as public 
health and conservation and care for the environment. 
  Britain agreed at last year's United Nations ``Earth 
Summit'' 
in Rio de Janeiro to present its strategy plans by the end of 
this year to the new UN Commission on Sustainable Development. 
Earlier this year, John Gummer, the Environment Secretary, 
published a public consultation paper on the subject, but 
officials say the Government's report has been delayed by the 
November Budget, when measures such as taxing domestic fuel 
bills were introduced. The Government hopes that such measures 
will help it meet its international treaty obligations to cut 
emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to 
changing the Earth's climate. 
  Launching his consultation document, Mr. Gummer said that 
the 
essence of sustainable economic growth was that ``we cannot pay 
for our development out of our children's purses.'' He added: 
``Sustainable development simply means growing in ways for which 
future generations will thank us. It does not mean being against 
development. That would do our grandchildren no favours. It 
means instead developing in such a way that we respect the 
delicate balances on which our lives depend.'' [Passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Charles Clover and George Jones] </F>
  [Text] Britain will be allowed to delay or relax EC 
pollution standards for drinking water, bathing beaches and 
rivers. 
  Mr. Major confirmed in the Commons last night that the 
European summit in Brussels had agreed to repeal the 10-year-old 
bathing and drinking water directives and replace them with less 
intrusive regulations, enabling ``broad, general standards'' to 
be applied at national level. 
  Seventeen EC directives have been withdrawn or amended in 
the 
purge of legislation, part of an Anglo-French initiative to 
apply the principle of ``subsidiarity'' to laws which gave 
Governments little flexibility. 
  Two key EC directives on water quality remain in force: one 
aimed at reducing pollution from nitrates and another on urban 
waste water treatment, which Mr. Clarke, Chancellor, said 
recently would cost Britain &pound;10 billion to implement 
instead 
of the original estimate of &pound;2 billion. 
  According to Mr. Yeo, Environment Minister, water 
bills--forecast to rise by up to &pound;100 by the end of the 
century in some areas--would now rise more slowly. 
  Mr. Major said other Governments were listing EC laws to 
axe. 
``We are determined to maintain high standards, but we are 
determined, too, to simplify European legislation, to make it 
less intrusive and leave more room for national choice.'' 
  However, officials stressed that the extent to which Britain 
would be allowed to relax standards for drinking water was not 
clear, as new directives had to be agreed in the spring. 
  ``We cannot repeal EC laws simply because we think the 
standards are set too high,'' said one. ``The aim is to simplify 
decision-making and meet the Maastricht Treaty requirements that 
as much legislation as possible is conducted at national level 
unless it can be shown that it would be more effective at EC 
level.'' 
  The cull of EC directives has been led by Mr. Major and Mr. 
Clarke, against the advice of Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary, 
who has said it would be politically unpopular to be seen 
dismantling EC pollution controls. 
  Ministers argued yesterday that there would not be a fall in 
Britain's standards. 
  Mr. Yeo said the Government would be using the new 
flexibility to determine its own standards for drinking water, 
incorporating the latest advice from the World Health 
Organisation on relaxing the standard for some pesticides. 
Britain provides water in excess of the present EC pesticides 
standards to 14.5 million people. The WHO recommends, however, a 
five-fold tightening of standards for lead, one of the most 
toxic substances. 
  Mr. Yeo said: ``I see it as part of my job to protect 
consumers against the extraordinary demands of some of the Green 
lobbies, who have the Brussels bureaucrats totally in their 
power and who are pressing ahead with demands for improvements 
which have no scientific or medical basis at all.'' 
  ``We do not want to waste money on things that have no 
benefit to the consumer.'' 
  Mr. Chris Smith, Labour environment spokesman, called the 
legislative changes a disaster. ``This is a smokescreen for 
saying the Government wants lower standards because they want 
lower costs. What this represents is a major step away from the 
fight against pollution.'' 
  Mr. Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, 
said: ``The idea that the British Government can be trusted on 
its own to ensure compliance with the highest standards to 
protect the quality of our rivers or drinking water is a joke.''

<F P=106> [Charles Clover article: ``Major Warns of Pain in 'Green' </F>
Plan for Britain''] 
  [Text] The Prime Minister gave warning of ``painful 
political action'' to protect the environment at the launch 
yesterday of a ``green'' action plan that promises higher fuel 
taxes and a city curb on cars. 
  The Government's followup to the Rio Earth Summit, an 
environmental action plan for the next 20 years, runs to four 
documents--nearly 600 pages, announced by nine ministers in the 
surroundings of Inigo Jones's Banqueting House in Whitehall. 
  The most controversial chapter of Britain's Sustainable 
Development Strategy, on transport, says that ``costs of travel, 
particularly costs of road travel, may well have to rise to 
reflect environmental costs and to affect levels of future 
demand for transport.'' 
  Mr. Major, launching the strategy, said: ``Sometimes quite 
painful political action may be necessary to meet environmental 
objectives.'' He admitted he ``did not expect to see people 
dancing in the street'' at the thought of road pricing. 
  He said that Britain's imposition of VAT [value-added tax] 
on 
heating and lighting, higher fuel prices and commitment to road 
pricing had already gone further than most other countries, but 
denied these would impose an intolerable burden on the economy. 
  An expansion of nuclear power might be necessary to meet 
future environmental commitments, he hinted. Alongside the 
overall environmental strategy, Major introduced the following 
documents: 
  The UK Climate Change Programme -- sets out in detail how 
Britain intends to meet its commitments to freeze carbon dioxide 
emissions by the year 2000. 
  The document shows for the first time that Britain will 
achieve a reduction in all gases that cause global 
warming--including methane and CFCs [chlorofluorocarbons]--of 
five percent. It commits Britain to setting targets after 2000 
but not what they will be. 
  The Biodiversity Action Plan--sets out 59 specific 
commitments to protecting wildlife and local distinctiveness . 
  The Forestry Action Plan--shows how Britain will increase 
forest cover. 
  Mr. Major announced a new panel of five ``wise men'' who 
will 
advise him and monitor progress on ``green issues,'' chaired by 
Sir Crispin Tickell, warden of Green College, Oxford, an 
unofficial adviser at Downing Street. 
  The others are Lord Alexander of Weedon, chairman of 
National 
Westminster Bank, Lord Selborne, chairman of the Government's 
statutory conservation watchdog, the Joint Nature Conservation 
Committee, Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission 
on Environmental Pollution and Dr. Anne Mclaren, vice-president 
of the Royal Society 
  Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary, announced that the 
Government would be setting up a Round Table on Sustainable 
Development which would bring together industry, local 
authorities and environmentalists to discuss environmental 
policies. 
  The Government also intended to stimulate a new ``citizen's 
environmental initiative'' in consultation with local 
authorities, churches and community groups. 
  Mr. Major's initiative received a chorus of criticism from 
Opposition MPs and environmental groups. Mr. Chris Smith. 
Labour spokesman for environmental protection, said the four 
reports contained ``no vision and few firm commitments to 
action.'' 
  The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Simon Hughes said 
the key Strategy document was ``full of `coulds', `ifs' and 
`maybes' when what the country needs is `whys', `whats' and 
`whens'.'' 
  The Green Party complained the Government ``lacked the 
courage of its convictions'' and the WorldWide Fund for Nature 
described the announcement as ``a lost opportunity.''

<F P=106> [Article by Jukka Perttu: ``Collaboration With Norwegians </F>
Produces Results More Quickly''] 
  [Text] Researcher Anatoly Vinogradov of the Kola Science 
Center criticizes the Finns not being action-minded when mutual 
efforts are made to solve Kola Peninsula environmental problems. 
``Working together with the Swedes, but especially the 
Norwegians, produces results much more quickly,'' compared 
Vinogradov. 
  He gave a presentation at the Foreign Policy Institute 
seminar on Friday [18 November]. The theme of the seminar was 
environmental cooperation in Finland and neighboring areas. 
Experts from Norway, Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Russia, Germany, 
and Japan had convened at the Gustavelund Convention Center in 
Tuusula. 
  Vinogradov's criticism was that much is promised at the 
government level, but then at the company level, profits are 
sought. He also presented a colorful environmental magazine that 
has been created as a joint project of Kola-Norwegian-Swedish 
cooperation. 
  Vinogradov argued that pollution in Kola does not harm the 
environment in Norway and Finland. 
  Ilkka Luotamo from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs borrowed 
Vinogradov's map and used an overhead projector to present it to 
the audience. The immense environmental problems in the St. 
Petersburg area and Karelia will also demand Finnish resources. 
Norway's interest, on the other hand is in the Kola Peninsula, 
where the boundary between the two countries is, Luotamo pointed 
out. 
  Researcher Heidi Hiltunen disputed the assertion that 
pollution coming from the Kola Peninsula would be harmless to 
Lapland. 
  According to Vinogradov, there are too many people in the 
Kola Peninsula when compared to the tolerance capacity of the 
environment--the density of population is many times greater 
than in Lapland. For that reason, relocating retirees, for 
example, in the south, in the St. Petersburg region among other 
places, has been begun. Between 10,000 and 20,000 people move 
south from the Kola Peninsula annually. 
<H5>  Finland Is Primary Source of Support for Estonia </H5>
  ``At this point Finland is the greatest provider of 
environmental support for Estonia,'' said director Tonis Kaasik 
of the Tallinn department of the Stockholm Environmental 
Institute. Almost all of the investment help in environmental 
matters has come from Finland. 
  The Nordic countries have divided the region into zones of 
responsibility, and aiding Estonia has been given to Finland. 
  Of foreign environmental aid, half has gone into protecting 
water resources, and about one-fifth into protecting the 
atmosphere. 
  When Finland, Sweden, and Denmark invest in cleaning up the 
water in Estonia, this investment reduces the pollution burden 
on the Baltic Sea more efficiently than if the same amount were 
used somewhere in the Nordic countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Johanna Mannila: ``Compensation Payment Would </F>
Improve Things in Contaminated Chelyabinsk''] 
  [Text] ``Much will be left undone in Chelyabinsk if the 
compensation being paid by Finns ceases,'' Anders Palmgren, 
director of Imatra Power, says critically about the government's 
decision last week to stop the shipment of nuclear wastes to 
Russia. 
  The spent fuel from Loviisa is taken into the southern 
Urals, 
to Chelyabinsk. The area was badly polluted during the 1950's 
when defense industry enterprises dumped nuclear wastes directly 
into a nearby river and lake. 
  Imatra Power has paid and continues to pay tens of millions 
of markkas for every shipment of fuel to Russia. ``Besides for 
the treatment of the fuel, the money is used for technical 
improvements in equipment and in cleaning up the damages to the 
environment from the military activity era,'' says Palmgren. 
<H5>  Western Equipment Cannot Be Obtained Without Foreign Currency </H5>
  ``With government decisions, Finland could stipulate that 
the 
treatment of spent fuel in foreign countries be done in a safe 
and environmentally noninjurious manner. The stipulation could 
include the provision that Finnish authorities will inspect the 
safety of the operation,'' Palmgren suggests as an alternative 
to the export ban. 
  ``Finland should have no philosophical basis for banning the 
exportation of spent fuel if Finnish authorities could inspect 
the safety of the treatment.'' 
  The leadership at the Radiation Safety Center is in 
agreement 
with this in the letter that it sent to Minister of Trade and 
Industry Seppo Kaariainen (Center Party). Head director Antti 
Vuorinen sums up the contents of the letter by stating that 
conditions at Chelyabinsk would become even worse than currently 
if the payments made by Imatra Power were to cease. ``Without 
foreign currency, Mayak, Inc., could not obtain western 
equipment.'' 
<H5>  Maintaining Collaboration Worthwhile </H5>
  In the opinion of the Radiation Safety Center, it is in 
Finland's best interests to continue and expand the well-begun 
collaboration with Russian nuclear safety authorities. ``The 
Imatra Power payments also serve to downscale the nuclear 
weapons industry in Chelyabinsk, and to transfer the personnel 
working in the area into peaceful purpose oriented jobs.'' 
  Vuorinen also reminds that civilian officials in Russia need 
Finnish support for taking care of the area and that the region 
was closed to Russian civilian officials up until last year. 
  According to the Radiation Safety Center, it is realistic 
for 
Finland to expect, over the long term, Russian technical 
competence and know-how to be able to also improve the safety of 
the burial of the Olkiluoto nuclear waste. In any case, Russia 
has to solve a much more extensive problem than Finland's in the 
ultimate storage program. 
  ``If the exporting to Russia ceases, it will mean the actual 
reduction of cooperation between our two countries in the field 
of treatment of nuclear waste. At the same time we lose our 
chance to have an impact on the safety of nuclear waste 
treatment in the Chelyabinsk region and on the environmental 
cleanup of that region,'' fears Vuorinen. 
<H5>  Efficiency Inspection in January </H5>
  Experts from the Radiation Safety Center will join Russian 
nuclear safety authorities in focusing on Chelyabinsk in 
January. During this technical visit, the radiation conditions 
of the region, as well as the safety of nuclear waste treatment 
will be mapped. 
  The agreement between Imatra Power and the Russians about 
the 
returning of fuel is in force with a noncancellability clause 
for as long as the Loviisa power plant is in use. The conditions 
of the agreement have been re-examined at five-year intervals. 
Current conditions are in force until 1996. 
  ``If no agreement on the returning of fuel is reached in 
1996, Imatra Power will continue to have the right to return 
spent fuel for three more years, but at a higher price,'' says 
Palmgren. 
  If Finland decides to not abide by the agreement, Imatra 
Power will have to pay compensation to the Russians. 
  Minister of Trade and Industry Seppo Kaariainen will soon 
decide what kind of committee will be named to study ways to 
stop exports. Jussi Manninen, the negotiating civil servant of 
the Ministry of Trade and Industry, estimates that the committee 
will arrive at a recommendation in a couple of months. 
<H5>  About Three Percent </H5>
  About 3 percent of spent fuel is of the longest lasting and 
most dangerous variety of waste, the ultra-active waste. 
  If spent fuel is placed in final storage in Finland's 
bedrock, it will all be ultra-active waste. 
  Industrial Power, Inc., intends to bury fuel from the 
Olkiluoto reactor into bedrock, and Imatra power will do 
likewise if exports cease. 
  The spent fuel that has been taken from Loviisa to Russia 
has 
undergone a retreatment process in which the ultra-active waste 
is separated from uranium and plutonium that can be recycled. 
Retreatment is a common procedure also in France, Japan, Great 
Britain, and the United States. 
  In Russia, the uranium extracted from the fuel is used in 
the 
manufacture of fuel for Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors. The 
plutonium has temporarily been put in storage because the 
manufacture of plutonium fuel, due to its high toxicity, 
requires a much more advanced technique than the manufacture of 
uranium fuel. 
  The remaining ultra-active waste has been melted into a very 
stable, glassy mass. 
  The possibility that Finland would do the retreatment has 
been considered nil, because the plants are expensive and 
require more operational volume than provided by Finland's 
nuclear program.

  [Editorial Report] Ouagadougou Radiodiffusion Nationale du 
Burkina Radio in French at 1300 GMT on 18 January reports that 
financial backers and government officials met in Ouagadougou on 
18 January to discuss the country's national environmental 
action plan. According to Roch Marc Christian Kabore, minister 
of state in charge of finance and planning, the aim of the 
meeting was to exchange views with partners on the environmental 
action plan as well as to improve consultations and coordination 
with cooperation partners for better implementation of the plan. 
He said the meeting was also intended to make the international 
community aware of government efforts to establish and implement 
the national action plan. However, the major objective of the 
meeting was to mobilize funds for the plan and to serve as a 
reminder that natural resources are exhaustible and therefore 
need protection.

  [Text] Harare Jan 27 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's land reform 
programme has brought extensive deforestation on former 
commercial farms where 54,000 families have been settled since 
independence in 1980, the ZIANA news agency reported on 
Thursday. ``There was no planning on how the forest resources 
in these areas would be used,'' said David Mazambani, manager of 
the Forestry Extension Services Division of the state-owned 
Forestry Commission. Figures based on 1988 land satellite 
images show that thick natural forests with more than 80 percent 
canopy cover now constitute less than 10 percent of Zimbabwe. 
Forests were being destroyed to make way for fields, while wood 
fuel was being used for tobacco curing, burning bricks, 
household needs and the building of new homes in the 
resettlement areas. The Forestry Commission has stepped up 
efforts to make communities aware of the need for sustainable 
exploitation of forests.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769): ``China's </F>
Choice in Environmental Protection in 1993''] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 Jan (XINHUA) 
<H3>  China's Environmental Protection Achievements Attract 
Worldwide Attention </H3>
  China's economy has entered another period of rapid 
development in the 1990's. 
  Economic development, population growth, and higher 
consumption levels mean our country faces the threat of a global 
environmental problem. Moreover, with the increased degree of 
development and urbanization, as well as the development of 
village and town enterprises, environmental pollution and 
ecological damage accompanying our economic development have 
increasingly become an important factor actually obstructing our 
economic and social development. 
  In 1993, the World Environmental Day meeting and award 
ceremony for the world's ``top 500'' were held in Beijing. The 
event attracted worldwide attention for China's environmental 
protection. 
  In environmental protection, China has always been in the 
front ranks of developing countries. 
  Many of our achievements have gone down in the history of 
civilization: 
  -- Ecological agriculture has spread across the country, 
with 
the establishment of several thousand ecological agriculture 
experimental units of various types and size. As early as the 
beginning of the 1980's, China stopped the production of 
insecticides with strong poisons and high residue. The 
agricultural department began experimenting on pollution-free 
production and made new progress in afforestation on plains and 
along coastal regions. In particular, the shelter-forest project 
in the northeast-north-northwest region is known as ``the 
world's best ecological project.'' 
  -- Success has been achieved in preventing industrial 
pollution. A large number of industrial pollution control 
facilities built in our country in the 1980's have successively 
yielded results, raising the rate of disposal of three wastes 
[waste gas, waste water, and industrial residue], as well as the 
up-to-standard rate, remarkably. 
  -- China's urban environmental situation has improved 
remarkably. As a result of the comprehensive efforts to improve 
the environment, the environmental quality of many cities has 
become better to varying degrees. Despite large increases in 
the urban population and energy consumption, urban atmospheric 
conditions have basically not worsened and the amount of some 
pollutants in the atmosphere have even decreased, thanks to 
various urban air pollution control measures. 
  China's environmental protection has unique features, which 
have attracted the attention of the Third World. 
<H3>  Our Country Still Faces Grim Environmental Protection 
Prospects At a Time of Rapid Economic Development </H3>
  According to relevant departments, our country should 
soberly 
assess its current status of environment protection, despite its 
tremendous achievements in preventing and controlling industrial 
pollution. In the past year, some newly-launched projects, 
especially ``wholly or partly foreign-owned'' construction 
projects in development zones, continued to develop new 
pollution sources because they failed to strictly implement 
relevant state regulations mandating environmental impact 
assessments, and the ``simultaneous construction of projects and 
facilities to control three wastes.'' Pollution in village and 
town enterprises worsened with each passing day, and the general 
level of industrial pollution increased. 
  In 1992, 36.6 billion tonnes of waste water was released 
across the country, up 9 percent from 1991; this figure does not 
cover village and town enterprises. The amount of waste water 
released last year was significantly higher than that discharged 
in the preceding year. Although the water quality in the main 
course of the Chang Jiang is good, pollution is quite serious 
near the river banks in sections that run through the major 
cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Only 41 
percent of the 38,000 km stretches of the seven major rivers and 
inland rivers subject to water quality tests measure up to 
first- and second-class water quality standards, whereas 48 
percent indicate fairly serious pollution. Surface water 
pollution is serious in the cities, with the river stretches in 
80 percent of the cities suffering varying degrees of pollution. 
Statistics on 67 cities show that the annual and daily average 
levels of suspended atmospheric particles in approximately half 
of those cities exceed the limits. The annual and daily average 
levels of sulfur dioxide in 13 cities exceed secondary state 
limits. 
  Our country's ecological problems also cannot be neglected. 
  The devastating sandstorm that erupted in the northwest on 5 
May 1993 left 85 people dead and 31 missing. Once again, we 
were given a warning of ecological destruction. 
  The entire country is suffering from grassland degradation, 
desertification, salinization, and alkalinization. The illegal 
occupation and utilization of farmland has yet to be completely 
halted. 
  Soil erosion is serious. A recent survey shows that 1.93 
million square km [sq km] and 1.88 million sq km of land is 
affected by water and wind erosion, respectively. A sandstorm 
danger line totaling 10,000 li has been formed in northwest, 
north, and northeast China. Approximately one-third of the 
country's land is threatened by sandstorms, and more than 60 
percent of impoverished counties in our country are concentrated 
within this line. Economic losses from sandstorms reach 4.5 
billion yuan annually. 
<H3>  The Entire Country Was Buffeted by the Environmental 
Protection Wave in 1993 </H3>
  Last spring, the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] 
decided to create an Environmental Protection Committee. Never 
before had our country set up environmental protection 
committees under both the government and the NPC. 
  On 27 May, the State Environmental Protection Bureau 
released 
the names of 3,000 key pollution-causing enterprises in an 
attempt to encourage enterprises to control pollution. Unlike 
in the past when enterprises were allocated ``spots'' in order 
of their output value, profits, and taxes, they were listed 
according to the amount of effluents. Some of the large and 
medium enterprises which had previously been considered 
``efficient'' were on the list. The move caused quite a stir 
throughout the country.

Mou Jingjun (3664 2529 0689)] 
  [Text] Harbin, 20 Jan (XINHUA) -- Heilongjiang Province 
has firmly implemented the State Council's ``Circular on Banning 
Rhinoceros Horn Trade'' and ``Circular on Speedily Investigating 
and Dealing With Illicit Activities of Smuggling and 
Profiteering in Rhinoceros Horns, Tiger Bones, and Other 
Endangered Species.'' Recently, it openly destroyed by burning 
on the bank of the Songhua River some 50 kg of tiger bones and 
rhinoceros horns confiscated since last year. This action has 
been well received in various quarters. 
  This is the first time China has resorted to burning 
confiscated rhinoceros horns and tiger bones which were to be 
resold at a profit. According to people concerned, 
Heilongjiang's action demonstrates China's seriousness in 
implementing the ``Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species.'' 
  Tigers and rhinoceroses are valuable and endangered wildlife 
that have been categorized as the state's first class key 
protected animals. Although China does not have rhinoceroses, 
it has attached great importance to the animal. Since 1981, it 
has never allowed rhinoceroses to be imported into the country, 
and has imposed a series of protective measures on tigers within 
Chinese territory. 
  Heilongjiang, which has relatively rich resources in wild 
animals, has all along paid due attention to protection of wild 
animals. During the statutory inspection organized by the 
Environmental Protection Committees under the National People's 
Congress and the State Council last year, Heilongjiang mobilized 
more than 3,800 people to carry out inspections in nature 
reserves, drug stores, pharmaceutical factories, ports, as well 
as guesthouses, markets, and trade fairs; and it adopted various 
measures to crack down on smuggling and profiteering in 
rhinoceros horns, tiger bones, and other rare wildlife; and the 
measures have had a positive effect on protecting wild animals.

  [Text] Nanchang, January 24 (XINHUA) -- The increase rate 
of forest resources in Jiangxi Province is growing faster than 
the consumption rate of the resources. 
  Five years ago there were about 2.6 million ha [hectares] of 
treeless mountain areas, and soil erosion was getting worse. 
  To reverse this situation the province set up 490 model 
tree-planting centers which planted trees on a total area of 
about 63,000 ha. 
  The centers were also responsible for popularizing advanced 
technology, and techniques of transplanting trees and 
cultivating seedlings. 
  Now there are more than 13,000 tree-planting units and 
forest 
farms in Jiangxi which are responsible for their own profits and 
losses. 
  In 1993 the afforested area in the mountain regions of 
Jiangxi was about 38,000 ha. 
  Statistics show that from 1989 to 1992 the afforested area 
in 
the province amounted to 184,000 ha, and the forest coverage 
rate in the province rose from 30 percent in 1988 to 40.3 
percent in 1992.

  [Text] Lanzhou, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists 
have made breakthroughs in the study of gas geochemistry, 
promoting the country's exploration of oil and gas, and study of 
the changes of the global climate and environment. 
  This science, which is only about a decade old, involves 
research into natural resources, and changes of climate and 
environment, and forecasting and prevention of geological 
disasters. 
  China's key laboratory for gas geochemistry was set up at 
the 
Lanzhou Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
in this capital of northwest China's Gansu Province in 1985. It 
was opened to foreign scientists in 1991. 
  Since then, Chinese scientists have made great progress in 
research into the storage and transformation of oil and gas, 
changes of global climate and environment, and seismic 
activities. 
  Since 1991 the laboratory has completed 792 major research 
projects designated by the state, related state ministries and 
Gansu Province. 
  Chinese scientists at the lab have put forward a new theory 
of ``multi-sources and continuous formation in different 
stages'' for the formation of natural gas. 
  Meanwhile, they have made new progress in the study of 
geological structure, volcanoes and earthquakes by using helium 
isotopes. 
  They have also developed a series of new technologies and 
methods for the exploration of oil and gas, which have made 
great contributions to the development of the Tarim Basin in the 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  At a state project appraisal meeting, some well-known 
scholars described the lab as a showcase of China's study of gas 
geochemistry, calling it an international center of the science. 
  The lab has academic exchanges and cooperation with many 
countries and regions, including Germany, the United States, 
Sweden, Russia, Japan and Italy.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 January (XINHUA) -- Chinese researchers 
have found a new way to raise the survival rate of trees planted 
on the Loess Plateau. 
  By retaining water or rainfall storage, the survival rate of 
trees in semi-arid areas has been raised to about 90 percent 
from 30 percent. 
  The new method, developed by researchers from Beijing 
Forestry University after five years' study, consists of 
collecting and storage of rainfall and maintaining soil 
moisture, is able to double or even triple the water available 
for trees in arid or semi-arid areas. 
  Arid and semi-arid land accounts for 52.5 percent of China's 
total territory, and the average tree survival rates were four 
percent and 30 percent in arid and semi-arid areas respectively.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhu Baoxia: ``State Gives Go-Ahead to </F>
Green Foundation''] 
  [Text] The central government is to set up a foundation to 
provide low-interest loans to major environmental projects, it 
was announced yesterday. 
  The foundation is meant to be a stable source of 
low-interest 
finance to fight widespread pollution, with no extra burden on 
the State budget, said Xie Zhenhua, director of the State 
Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa). 
  Xie told an expert meeting in Beijing yesterday that the 
country s environment had been deteriorating in all but a few 
places for years. 
  One of the major factors in the growing problem has been a 
lack of cash, Xie said. 
  In the 1980's, the State invested 64.7 billion yuan (about 
$11.3 billion at the old exchange rate) on environmental 
projects, 0.6 percent of gross domestic product over the decade. 
  Experts say at least 75 billion yuan ($8.6 billion at the 
current exchange rate) more is needed in the next six years, if 
the State is to contain worsening pollution. 
  Xie stressed the government should be just one source of 
cash 
and more channels must be found to guarantee quick, sustainable 
environmental protection. 
  The repayable foundation system is one of the more feasible 
and effective approaches to attract cash, he said. 
  It aims to provide cash mainly to industrial 
pollution-control projects which will be repaid from the 
resulting savings the factories make. 
  The foundation will be built with cash from the State 
budget, 
grants and loans from international organizations, foreign 
governments and individuals and domestic donations. 
  Its draft programme being discussed at the expert meeting 
which ends today suggests a national environmental protection 
investment company be set up to organize fundraising and loans. 
  The company, which is subordinate to Sepa, will be 
responsible for collecting funds, selecting projects and 
supervising the use of loans. 
  Priority would be given to cross-province pollution control 
and environmental projects outlined in international and 
bilateral agreements. 
  The company will also invest in pollution-control projects 
in 
major State-owned enterprises to set an example for other 
industries. 
  Xie said Sepa is set to start pilot environmental projects 
in 
21 provinces and cities, including Beijing, Guangzhou, Liaoning 
and Heilongjiang. 
  The national environmental foundation programme was based on 
an experiment first introduced five years ago in Shenyang, a 
heavy industry city in Northeast China's Liaoning Province. 
  Shenyang, with over 5,000 industrial enterprises, has long 
been one of the country's most seriously-polluted cities. 
  The Shenyang Environmental Protection Investment Company 
(Sepic) has loaned 162 million yuan (over $28 million) to local 
factories since 1988 to help technical renovation designed to 
control industrial pollution.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 January (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
wildlife official today denied overseas reports that bears in 
captivity in China are tortured. 
  Vice-minister of Forestry Shen Maocheng said that reports of 
torture of bears on a farm in south China's Guangdong Province 
are partly false and partly rumors. 
  According to propaganda by an animal welfare fund in Britain 
and reports by German media, bears on Nanping Bear Farm in 
Zhuhai Special Economic Zone, Guangdong Province, were not only 
used to produce bile which was siphoned through a tube from the 
liver, but also were killed to make food or soup, said the 
minister. 
  The reports also estimated that 8,000 bears in China were 
tortured in that way everyday and China planned to use 40,000 
bears for bile production, Shen said. 
  The minister told XINHUA that there are about 5,000 bears in 
captivity in China for bile production and China will not 
increase the number, since the bile output is enough for 
traditional Chinese medicine production. 
  Shen added that ``there is indeed a bear with only three 
paws 
on the farm, but the lost paw was not cut away by the farm 
owner.'' 
  He added that the three-pawed bear was picked up from the 
wild and raised by the owner. 
  Investigations show that the farm was set up without 
official 
permission and the illegal farm has been closed, he said. 
  Under an official regulation issued in 1991 on bear raising, 
training and breeding, farms without adequate techniques or 
facilities are not allowed to raise bears. 
  ``It is unreasonable and extremely unfair to ignore China's 
great efforts to preserve wildlife and its substantial progress 
by using a single example.'' 
  He admitted that some bear farms, which had been run without 
official permission and were poorly equipped, were shut down 
last year, indicating that basic requirements for operation 
include adequate technology and facilities. 
  ``Since the existing authorized farms produce enough bile, 
no 
new farm will be allowed to be set up,'' Shen said. 
  He said that China cannot agree with the one-sided view by 
some pure conservationists in the world which emphasizes 
preservation and opposes any kind of use of animals. 
  ``In that case, all the scientific experiments and research 
which use animals should not be carried out. Human beings can 
not use horses and oxen to work and can no longer eat chickens 
and mutton,'' the minister said. 
  He added that ``China puts preservation and protection of 
bear resources first and use of bears second.'' 
  According to official estimates, there are tens of thousands 
of wild bears in China. 
  ``China made great achievements in protecting and preserving 
endangered wildlife in the past decade and will continue to do 
so,'' Shen said. ``We welcome well-meaning advice and aid given 
by all the other countries in the world to join in the effort to 
preserve wildlife.''

  [Text] In an alert report ``The Ecological Deficit: Future 
Crisis That Chinese People Have To Fight for Their Surviving,'' 
which was compiled by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' 
Eco-Environmental Research Center for the State Science and 
Technology Commission, listed 10 most serious ecological 
problems China is facing: 
  1) Unproper development and utilization of the mountain and 
ecology-fragile areas accounting for 65 percent and 9.7 percent 
respectively of China's territory, has accelerated its 
large-scale soil erosion and ecological imbalance. 
  2) Increasing catastrophy of natural disasters is expanding 
areas of damage and environmental deterioration. 
  3) Gradual shrinkage of forestated areas caused by 
overdenudation has turned China into a poor forestation country. 
  4) Unplanned reclamation and long-standing herding have 
speeded up degeneration of grassland, totally about 1.3 billion 
mu (20 million mu per year), or about one-third of China's 
utilizable grassland. 
  5) Desertification is getting serious, for example, in 
northern China, an area of 1.49 million square kilometers, or 
15.5 percent of Chinese territory has desertified. 
  6) Overpumping and overpollution of ground water has brought 
serious water shortage problem to China. 
  7) Overpopulation, unbalanced distribution of natural 
resources are also the causes of China's serious environmental 
problem. 
  8) Air pollution is getting worse, areas damaged by acid 
rain 
are expanding, solid waste and human residue are mounting, which 
means that a foreseeable serious environmental problem will soon 
follow. 
  9) Forty percent of township enterprises are becoming major 
polluters, increase in pollution of agriculture and forestry 
will surely offset the economic growth. 
  10) China has already encountered heavy economic loss caused 
by environmental deterioration, Chinese people's lives and 
security of their property are being threatened by the vicious 
cycle of unexpected accidents.

<F P=106> [``Roundup'': ``Shanghai Strives To Improve Environment''] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, 30 January (XINHUA) -- Anyone who revisits 
Shanghai will be happy to see the daily improved environment 
here. 
  Factories discharging heavy pollution in urban areas have 
been removed or switched to produce pollution-free goods, and 
the first construction phase of the waste water treatment 
project on Suzhou Creek across the city has been completed. 
  Projects completed last year included the expansion of the 
Zhabei Water Works, construction of the Yangpu Bridge and 
plantation of lawns and street gardens. 
  According to Gu Yongkang, an official of the municipal 
bureau 
of environmental protection, the rapid economic development will 
inevitably bring with it pollution problem. 
  To develop Shanghai -- China's biggest economic center -- 
into a world first-class metropolis, with clean, beautiful and 
comfortable surroundings, the municipal government is spending 
23.9 billion yuan, including foreign loans, on environmental 
protection and urban construction in the 1991-95 period. 
  Included in this sum is a record 10 billion yuan used in 
1993. 
  ``The days are numbered when people smell because of the 
Suzhou Creek a mile off,'' said Zhou Yucheng, senior engineer of 
the Shanghai construction company for treating waste water. 
  A 33.39-kilometer-long pipe has been laid to carry water 
from 
the creek in the urban area directly to the East China Sea after 
treatment. 
  ``When the whole project is completed,'' Zhou noted, ``it 
will be able to treat and clean the waste water in the creek for 
industrial use and irrigating crops.'' 
  A survey shows that about 300 industrial enterprises 
discharging pollution in urban areas had been removed or 
switched to produce pollution-free goods by the end of 1993 and 
300 more are ready for treatment. 
  ``From now on, no factory which does not accord with the 
demands of environmental protection is allowed to be built in 
the urban area,'' said Gu Bochuan, an official of the Shanghai 
Municipal Economic Commission in Charge of Planning. 
  ``Shanghai will follow the new industrial pattern with focus 
on the development of pollution-free, high-tech industries 
including electronics, computer and bio-engineering,'' he added. 
  While rearranging the industrial structure, China's most 
populous city has also vowed to expand green coverage in its 
limited urban area. 
  According to a plan of the municipal greening department, 
Shanghai will build three new parks this year, bringing the 
total number in the city up to 61, and expand tree belts, lawns 
and gardens by 93 hectares during this period. 
  By the end of the year 2000, Shanghai residents will have an 
average of four square meters of public green areas per capita, 
up from 1.1 square meters per capita at present. 
  According to the municipal environmental protection bureau, 
Shanghai will adopt measures to clean the Huangpu River. 
  Included are construction of animal droppings treatment 
projects on the upper reaches of the river, and taking specific 
measures to prevent and clean industrial pollution. 
  At present, Shanghai is building a second drinking water 
source. 
  Projects whose construction has been completed include the 
expansion of the Zhabei Water Works, Lingqiao Water works in New 
Pudong Area, a newly-established economic zone, Yuepu Water 
Works and the Qingchaosha Reservoir. 
  Upon completion, a bureau official said, these projects will 
greatly help improve the drinking water quality of Shanghai 
residents. 
  In addition, the city will build a wild animal farm and a 
tree belt this year. 
  Huang Ju, mayor of the city, said: ``Our purpose is to 
develop Shanghai into a city with the world's first-grade 
ecology and modern infrastructure facilities.'' 
  More and more people in Shanghai are full of confidence in 
this aim.

  [Text] Beijing, January 24 (XINHUA) -- In spite of progress 
in environmental protection, China's environmental pollution 
remains serious, a leading Chinese environmental official said 
here today, 
  Zhang Kunmin, deputy chief of the State Bureau for 
Environmental Protection (SBEP), said China has set up an 
effective and efficient environmental protection administrative 
system during the past decade or more while promoting its 
economic development. 
  ``China's gross national product (GNP) has doubled during 
the 
past decades, but its environment has not deteriorated 
accordingly, and in some areas environmental pollution has even 
been reduced,'' the official said. 
  Speaking at an international symposium on the environmental 
protection action plan, Zhang said that it still remains an 
arduous task for China to create an ideal environment in the 
coming years because of its huge and growing population and 
rapidly expanding economy. 
  According to statistics, China's nearly 1.2 billion 
population grows by 15 million each year on average, while its 
cultivated land is shrinking at an average rate of 300,000 ha 
[hectares] each year. The per capita share of the major 
resources in China, such as fresh water, cultivated land, 
forest, grassland and important mineral resources, is much lower 
than the world's average. 
  Gao Guangsheng, an official from the State Planning 
Commission, said that the total amount of standard fuel and 
metal consumed each year by China will be twice as much as the 
total consumed by the world in 1970 if China's economy continues 
to grow rapidly in a traditional development pattern and China's 
per capita GNP reaches 4,000 U.S. dollars by the mid-21st 
century. 
  ``Obviously, the traditional development strategy is in no 
way acceptable to China,'' said Gao. 
  He said that China has been paying close attention to the 
experiences drawn by developed countries and mapped out a 
strategy for sustainable economic and social development. 
  In response to the earth summit meeting in Brazil in 1992, 
China has made up ``10 countermeasures on the environment and 
development,'' ``China's Agenda 21,'' a strategy for China's 
sustainable economic and social development in the coming 
century, and ``China's Environmental Protection Action Plan'' in 
the past two years. 
  ``China expects more cooperation with other countries and 
international institutions in environmental protection since 
China lacks expertise and investment in those regards,'' Zhang 
said. 
  Also present at the seminar were about 60 environmental 
experts or officials, including some from Britain, Germany, 
Denmark, Canada and China, and some foreign diplomats in China. 
  The four-day seminar was jointly held by SBEP, the State 
Planning Commission and the State Foreign Experts' Affairs 
Bureau.

  [Text] Beijing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- China is putting the 
final touches to its environmental protection action plan, which 
aims to bring its worsening environmental pollution basically 
under control by the year 2000. 
  Wang Yuqing, director of the Planning Department of the 
State 
Environmental Protection Agency, said that China's environmental 
protection action plan -- a ten-year agenda -- will contain the 
general objectives of environmental protection, main targets of 
pollution control and the protection of the ecological 
environment in China by the year 2000. 
  China's economy has doubled during the past 15 years -- and 
is to grow at an estimated 10 percent annually -- which has 
caused an acute shortage of power and increasing energy 
consumption, 70 percent of it coal. 
  Speaking at an international seminar on environmental 
protection action plan, Wang said that China now faces seven 
pressing environmental problems, including water pollution, air 
pollution in cities, harmful industrial waste and garbage 
pollution in cities, lack of water resources, soil erosion, low 
afforestation percentage and grassland degradation, and decrease 
of species. 
  ``These environmental problems have greatly affected the 
health of the people, hindered the improvement of their living 
standard and economic development,'' Wang said. 
  He noted that China will formulate industrial and economic 
policies for sustainable development, enhance environmental 
legislation and law enforcement, and improve existing 
environmental protection agencies. 
  ``As a developing country with limited human, material and 
financial resources, China will have to set priorities of its 
environmental protection work,'' said the official. 
  He said that China will focus on environmental protection in 
cities, especially 52 major cities on the government's list for 
environmental protection, in which the focus should be on the 
control of water, air, solid waste and noise pollution. 
  He disclosed that China has selected about 9,000 major 
polluting enterprises as the targets for pollution control. 
  As far as the protection of nature is concerned, priority 
will be given to the protection of biological resources, such as 
forests, grassland, desert plants, animals and particularly 
precious and endangered species. 
  Zhang Kunmin, deputy director of the State Environmental 
Protection Agency, told the seminar yesterday said that it 
``still remained an arduous task'' for China to create an ideal 
environment in the coming years because of its huge and growing 
population and rapidly expanding economy.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 18 Jan (XINHUA) -- The 19th 
Conference of the International Union of Nature Conservation and 
Natural Resources held its 101st meeting in Argentina's capital 
Buenos Aires on 18 January. In his speech at the meeting, 
Chinese delegate expressed China's resolute opposition to the 
union council's decision to admit the so-called ``International 
Tibet Lawyers Committee'' as a member of the union. 
  In his speech, Shen Maocheng, Chinese vice minister of 
forestry and vice president of the China Wildlife Protection 
Association, pointed out: The ``International Tibet Lawyers 
Committee'' is not a nature conservation organization. The 
committee's activities are stirring up Tibet independence and 
splitting China; these activities have nothing to do with 
Tibet's nature conservation and the protection of Tibet's 
natural resources. Since the organization was formed in 1989, 
it has never provided practical aid and support in any form to 
Tibet's nature conservation. 
  Shen Maocheng stressed: Tibet has always been an inalienable 
part of China's sacred territory. China resolutely opposes any 
foreign forces' activities designed to split China. 
  The Chinese delegate's speech won support of the delegates 
of 
Pakistan and other countries. The meeting's chairman (Lanfar) 
decided to set up a special committee to investigate the matter 
and to make a decision on whether or not to admit the 
``International Tibet Lawyers Committee.'' 
  The current international environmental protection meeting, 
whose theme is to ``show concern for the earth and its 
dwellers,'' opened in Buenos Aires on 17 January. More than 
1,300 delegates from 118 countries are attending the 10-day 
meeting.

  [Text] The German federal government set the targets -- 
three towns now want to meet them. The towns of Wuppertal, 
Remscheid and Solingen have joined forces in a unique 
association to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 25 to 30 
percent by the year 2005. They intend to develop a CO2 
reduction plan jointly at regional level. The project will be 
financed largely by the Construction and Housing Ministry of the 
land of North Rhine-Westphalia. 
  The most important sources have been known to science for a 
long time: industry, traffic and households. CO2 is also 
released when electricity is generated from fossil fuels such as 
coal and oil. So energy consumption must be reduced and made 
much more efficient. Improved thermal insulation of buildings is 
one way of saving energy. Today's modern household appliances 
use a lot less power than at the start of the 1970's. Moreover, 
using local public transport instead of the car also helps to 
cut CO2 emissions. 
  The three towns' activities will in the future be 
coordinated 
in a regional office. Initiative, a willingness to talk, and 
motivation are now required to bring about a consensus of those 
involved in authorities, associations and firms. The project 
will show its first results by 1995. Then it will also be clear 
where the universe of actions, set by the European Union, 
Federal Government, and laender, must be changed to achieve the 
great objective of CO2 reduction. 
  Wuppertal chief executive Joachim Cornelius says: ``The very 
fact that this forward-looking project is being tackled in the 
three large towns makes me optimistic and can only be of 
advantage.'' Many citizens are already wanting to take part.

  [Text] The Government of the Union of Myanmar [Burma] has 
become a party to the following convention and protocol by 
accession and acceptance on 24 November 1992: 
  The Vienna Convention for the protection of the ozone layer 
completed in Vienna on 22 March 1985; Montreal Protocol on 
Substances that Deplete Ozone Layer completed at Montreal on 16 
September 1987; and Amendments to the Montreal Protocol on

  The Vienna Convention provides a framework containing an 
agreement in principle to cooperate in protection of the ozone 
layer and the Montreal Protocol classifies actions to phase out 
the ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons, 
CFC, by the end of this century. 
  As a party to the protocol, Myanmar will be spared from the 
trade restrictions imposed by the protocol and will be allowed 
to import controlled substances within a 10-year grace period 
for limited domestic use for refrigeration and air conditioning. 
  Additionally, the protocol will provide Myanmar assistance 
to 
obtain ozone friendly technology and financial assistance to 
affect the necessary readjustment. Furthermore, Myanmar's 
accession to these important instruments underlines its 
commitment and responsibility to protect the global environment. 
  Since the establishment of the National Commission for

  [Text] Rangoon, Jan 27 (AFP) -- Burma's timber trade, 
halted during a three-month government probe into malpractice 
allegations against both entrepreneurs and corrupt officials, 
has been allowed to resume, officials say. 
  Local timber merchants contacted by AFP said they still 
needed clearance, however, from the military commanders with 
jurisdiction over the areas where timber concessions are located. 
  Dozens of people were given stiff jail sentences in 
connection with shady deals uncovered during the investigation 
by military intelligence, highlighted in the state-owned press. 
  But local observers noted that prices for timber and 
wood-based fuel had risen in the wake of the clampdown. 
  Charcoal, used widely for cooking, now costs more than 500 
kyats per basket, or around 12 kyats per pound -- almost three 
times the cost to consumers previously, the observers said. 
  A would-be house-owner cited a similar rise: ``I'm suddenly 
having to pay for my building material almost triple the prices 
of just three months ago.'' 
  Under a new forest law promulgated in 1992, which strictly 
limits extraction of timber for commercial purposes, Burma -- 
which owns nearly 75 percent of the world's teak reserves -- 
said it intended to preserve its forest resources. 
  The law required private timber merchants to apply for 
official permits through a competitive bidding system which was 
intended to encourage private sector investment in the industry 
while curbing illegal logging. 
  But reports of widespread malpractice involving timber 
businessmen, abetted by corrupt officials, triggered a sudden 
halt to logging in November and the official investigation. 
  Thousands of tons of illicit logs were seized and an 
unspecified number of smugglers and corrupt government officials 
were identified. 
  A recent report in the official New Light of Myanmar cited 
the example of 11 timber merchants and as many forest department 
employees who were sentenced this month by a special court in 
Rangoon to seven years in jail for illegal logging, smuggling 
and bribery. 
  The daily said the government had recovered cash and assets 
which were declared state property. 
  The money collected paid largely for a state-of-the-art 
multi-million-dollar international business center on the shores 
of Rangoon's Inya Lake. 
  At its recent inauguration, a senior forestry official said 
the center had cost the state ``next to nothing.'' 
  ``We constructed the building practically cost-free because 
all the expenses were paid for with fines and penalties slapped 
on timber merchants, both foreign and local, caught cheating 
us,'' he said, adding that the illegal logs confiscated had also 
gone a long way to defraying the costs. 
  The official disclosed that one foreign logging company 
caught red-handed not only had to pay a hefty fine but was 
charged double for logs already extracted, even though the wood 
was of the ``unreserved species.'' 
  Reliable sources said meanwhile that some logging 
concessions 
had been given a three-month extension for extraction if 
companies paid stiff fines and double charges to take out the 
logs.

  [Text] Majuro, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Top Marshall Islands 
government officials have criticised what they say is the 
failure of the United States to release information about the 
effects of its nuclear test program here. 
  Officials said they believed the lack of data had led to 
inadequate compensation being paid to Marshall Islanders. 
  In the wake of U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) admissions 
that U.S. citizens were used as unwitting guinea pigs for 
nuclear experiments, Foreign Minister Tom Kijiner said Monday 
that the United States had failed to release full information 
about its nuclear test program in the Marshalls. 
  His comments followed a recent medical study confirming that 
the Marshalls had a rate of thyroid tumours dramatically higher 
than in other parts of the world. 
  The study indicated health problems were not confined to the 
atolls of Rongelap, Utirik, Bikini and Enewetak, which the 
United States said were the only radiation-exposed areas in the 
Marshalls. 
  During the early 1980's, Marshall Islands negotiators sought 
detailed information about the 66 announced nuclear tests, 
Kijiner said in an interview. 
  ``But U.S. officials told us there was no further 
information 
to provide to us,'' he said, adding that the U.S. statements had 
proved to be false. 
  ``The United States wasn't fair to the Marshall Islands 
during the negotiations (of a treaty known as the Compact of 
Free Association between the two nations).'' 
  Last month, the DOE released previously classified 
information about the size of a majority of its nuclear tests in 
the Marshalls, information Kijiner said the Marshalls first 
requested more than a year ago. 
  The foreign minister said the United States released only 
selected information during the negotiations on the Compact of 
Free Association so that nuclear compensation would be minimised. 
  Marshall Islanders had brought lawsuits in U.S. courts 
seeking about five billion U.S. dollars in compensation for 
damages from the nuclear tests. 
  The United States provided a 150 million dollar trust fund 
to 
yield about 270 million dollars over 15 years in the compact 
that was negotiated in the late 1970's and early 1980's. 
  Marshalls Washington ambassador, Wilfred Kendall, said here 
that the matter of U.S. compensation ``needs to be revisited.'' 
  He concurred with Kijiner, saying that ``all the details 
(about the nuclear tests) were not on the table during the 
negotiations.'' 
  Their contention is supported by a leading U.S. congressman, 
California Democrat George Miller who is chairman of the House 
Committee on Natural Resources. 
  In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton earlier this 
month, Miller wrote: ``This committee has long been concerned 
that the entire story of the testing done in the Marshalls 
Islands has not yet been told and that the health and well-being 
of a significant number of Marshallese may depend on a look at 
all the facts.'' 
  Miller said some Rongelap islanders, who were engulfed in a 
cloud of radiation from a 1954 hydrogen bomb test at Bikini, 
have charged that they were used as guinea pigs to further U.S. 
understanding of the effects of radiation. 
  ``In the light of the recent disclosures regarding actual 
radiation experimentation in the United States during this 
period, that possibility cannot be ignored,'' he wrote. 
  He called on the Clinton administration to declassify 
information on the nuclear test program in the Marshalls.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan 23 KYODO -- A coalition of civic groups 
opposed to high noise levels at U.S. military bases in Japan has 
decided not to appeal a U.S. federal court's dismissal of its 
original lawsuit last November, coalition representatives said 
Sunday [23 January]. 
  The representatives of the NEPA [National Environmental 
Protection Act] coalition filed suit three years ago with a U.S. 
court calling for environmental impact studies to be undertaken 
at the U.S. military facilities at Atsugi and Yokosuka in 
Kanagawa Prefecture and Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture. 
  They had called for the study to be ordered in accordance 
with the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), a U.S. 
law that requires environmental impact studies on federal 
projects. 
  But the U.S. federal district court in Washington ruled last 
November that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing in seeking 
remedies from U.S. courts. The ruling followed the U.S. Navy 
counsel's argument that NEPA does not extend to overseas U.S. 
military operations. 
  NEPA coalition representatives said the decision was taken 
because the chances of an appeals court overturning the November 
ruling appeared dim. 
  They said the coalition would continue seeking ways to get 
the U.S. Navy to reduce noise emitted by planes simulating 
carrier landings and takeoffs at the airfield.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan 20 KYODO -- Japanese and Russian 
Government officials will hold talks next week to discuss 
environmental problems and bilateral cooperation, the Foreign 
Ministry said Thursday [20 January]. 
  The meeting scheduled for 26-28 January in Tokyo is the 
first 
to be held under a treaty on environment protection cooperation 
agreed upon in 1991 between Japan and the former Soviet Union, 
the ministry said. 
  Japanese officials from eight government ministries and 
agencies, including the Foreign Ministry, Environment Agency, 
and Health and Welfare Ministry, will attend the meeting, it 
said. 
  The Russian delegation includes officials from the Foreign 
Ministry and Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources, it said. 
  The two sides will exchange views on Japanese and Russian 
environment administration and policies, and how each nation is 
tackling domestic and global environmental problems, as well as 
discussing bilateral cooperation, the ministry said.

<F P=106> [Article by Clive Sawyer, Municipal Reporter: ```Disastrous </F>
Results' for City's Health, Tourism''; first paragraph is THE 
ARGUS introduction] 
  [Text] Pollution from car exhausts in Cape Town has 
increased by 80 percent in the past 10 years--and in the next 10 
years could double, with disastrous results for health and 
tourism. 
<H5>  City Smog Guidelines Exceeded Twenty-Four Times </H5>
  Pollution guidelines have been violated 24 times in Cape 
Town 
so far this year, says medical officer of health Michael Popkiss. 
  Whether smog is visible depends on weather conditions, when 
warm air traps pollutants in a process known as inversion. 
  But even if pollution is not visible, it is there--and 
suspicion is directed mainly at petrol-driven engines and 
wood-burning in areas without electricity. 
  ``The only way to reduce air pollution is to get it at 
source, and you can do that only by making cars with 
cleaner-burning engines, with catalytic converters and a proper 
fuel economy system,'' said Dr. Popkiss. 
  He said unleaded petrol was a prerequisite for cleaner 
air--but warned that using unleaded petrol in cars without 
catalytic converters could worsen air pollution. 
  However, unleaded petrol and catalytic converters were not 
enough. 
  ``You have to stop cars ... and for this you need a better 
system of public transport.'' 
  The solution is to increase drastically the cost of using 
private cars to raise funds for public transport, says a city 
council report. 
  A city planner's draft report on a future public transport 
policy said that even if traffic growth increased more slowly, 
travelling speeds would drop by about 40 percent as congestion 
worsened. 
  ``The detrimental impacts on the health of Cape Town people 
and tourism, worth about R1,4 billion a year, will be severe.'' 
  The report said Cape Town had to focus on public transport 
if 
it was to become one of the great cities of the world. This 
could be done by introducing policies on parking provision and 
fees, planning and development. 
  ``Such a policy will undoubtedly be unpopular with many 
because for public transport to succeed, the playing fields must 
be levelled and motorists must start to pay the true cost of 
using cars.'' 
  ``Motoring will become more expensive and the revenue 
collected should be used to finance public transport 
improvements.'' 
  A metropolitan transport authority ``with sufficient 
statutory power, accountability and financial clout'' was needed 
to coordinate bus, rail, and minibus taxi services. 
  The population of metropolitan Cape Town was growing by 
about 
three percent a year and most new residents would be poor people 
living on the periphery of the city. 
  The number of travellers, and distances travelled, would 
increase dramatically. Most would have to use public transport. 
  A policy was needed to ensure public transport was 
affordable 
by all and offered an attractive alternative to car commuters. 
  ``It is likely spending in the new South Africa will focus 
on 
people's basic needs--housing, jobs, education and health.'' 
  ``Convenient, affordable and efficient transport will be 
essential in restructuring the apartheid city, but given the 
backlog of needs the construction of transport facilities is 
likely to be a low priority on the government's shopping list,'' 
the report said. 
  Proposed policies included: 

  -  The city council supporting the principle that the 
motorist should meet the true cost of car commuting, and funds 
raised in this way be used to subsidise public transport. 
  -  The council investigates and promotes measures to dissuade 
commuting in single-occupant vehicles. 
  -  The council recognises the urgent need to improve public 
transport termini. 
  -  Subject to availability of funds, the council will give 
priority to the provision of public transport facilities. 
  -  A parking policy that encourages use of public transport. 
  -  A review of public transport subsidies to benefit users. 
  -  Support and promotion of high-density development along 
public 
transport routes. 

    City planner Neville Riley and medical officer of health 
Michael Popkiss said the report should be put to the 
metropolitan transport advisory board and the Western Cape 
Economic Development Forum for discussion.

  [Text] Pretoria, Nov 22 SAPA -- South Africa [SA] has 
become a member of the International Union for the Conservation 
of Nature [IUCN] and Natural Resources, the leading global 
conservation authority. 
  Announcing the breakthrough on Monday, the Environment 
Affairs Department said South Africa had until now been 
represented at the IUCN by various government and 
nongovernmental organisations. The newly acquired state 
membership, however, would involve more votes for SA at IUCN 
general meetings, the next of which would be in January in 
Buenos Aires. 
  The IUCN's seminal 1991 document Caring For The Earth set 
practical guidelines for sustainable living on a global scale. 
  The union has played a leading role in the formulation of 
international conservation conventions such as Cites [Convention 
on International Trade in Environmental Species] (which monitors 
illegal trade in wild animals and plants), the Ramsar Wetlands 
Convention and CMS (the Convention on Migratory Species), to all 
of which SA is signatory. 
  The IUCN was created in 1948 and 111 countries and a total 
of 
682 organisations are reperesented.

  [Text] The Conservation industry has lost over 
E[Emalangeni]3.5 million worth of game from rhino-poaching alone 
in the last five years. This means about 70 percent of 
Swaziland's rhino have been wiped out by poachers since 1988 
when the commercial rhino horn poaching started. 
  Nature Conservationist, Mr. Ted Reilly, said this figure 
represents a direct cash value of animals poached. ``However, a 
more realistic value of the loss of Swaziland probably exceeds 
that figure by more than 10 times,'' he said. 
  ``The value of these losses is only just beginning to be 
felt. Those poached animals cannot be simply replaced, there is 
no insurance policy that will pay out the country for its loss 
of breeding stock.'' 
  ``Rhino, in particular, are slow breeding animals. Many of 
the slaughtered rhinos have been mature and productive animals. 
Many were heavily pregnant when poached. How do you put the 
value on the years it will take to get back to the point that we 
were at in restoring Swaziland's decimated wildlife heritage?'' 
  Mr. Reilly says because of the poaching pandemic, jobs have 
been lost, foreign exchange, tourism dwindled and investment in 
the industry discouraged. ``How can one invest if there is no 
guarantee that the money he spends in re-introducing species to 
his farm doesn't all disappear in front of his eyes as poachers 
decimate his breeding stock?'' 
  Asked what happens to trophies (target parts of animals) 
that 
have been confiscated from poachers, Mr. Reilly said in most 
cases the exhibits have mysteriously disappeared. ``There are 
also cases where one sees in the newspaper about elephant tusks 
and rhino horns being destroyed in a fire.'' 
  ``These are some of the factors giving rise to Section 24(5) 
in the new law which stipulates that no more than trotters or 
the head of the animal shall be needed as an exhibit.'' ``We 
have even had refusal of acceptance of a prisoner at Simunye 
because the whole animal didn't accompany the accused. The 
officer insisted that we bring the whole animal.'' 
  Mr. Reilly also blamed the courts for not being that 
``supportive'' in curbing the poaching crime. ``The draconian 
measures we have had to introduce in the new law are a result of 
courts failing to properly and responsibly apply the law.'' 
  ``The Game Amendment Act would, in large part, have been 
unnecessary had the courts been supportive. The Non-Bailable 
Offenses Order has similar origins.'' 
  To this, Mr. Reilly referred a case reported in THE TIMES 
early this year whereby the accused, Salatiyala Kunene of 
Khuphuka area, had his case withdrawn because the exhibits had 
been destroyed. 
  Mr. Reilly reported a long list of animal species already on 
the verge of extinction, poaching being one of the contributing 
factors.

  [Text] [words indistinct] Swaziland's head game warden, Ted 
Reilly, for help. Tom Holloway has the story: 
  The South African Police investigations concern flocks of 
ostriches from South Africa which (?smugglers) are swopping with 
ostrich flocks in Namibia, but illegally exporting to Swaziland 
and then reexporting to lucrative markets overseas. 
  Mr. Reilly explained that as South Africa has the largest 
population of the most productive ostriches left in Africa, it 
has banned the export of its ostriches which are most wanted 
overseas, in order to conserve and build up South Africa's 
ostrich population. The fact that Namibia's ostrich industry has 
been virtually brought to a standstill by uncontrolled exporting 
and smuggling of the birds, and the ban on exporting (?the 
birds) by South Africa, have increased the value and demand for 
ostriches in overseas markets, prompting smugglers and 
racketeers to move into the multimillion dollar industry. 
  Swaziland, however, said Mr. Reilly, does not want to be 
used 
in a racket which could damage its own ostrich industry, as well 
as the protected ostrich industry of its neighbor, South Africa. 
He said he had therefore agreed to assist the South African 
Police in their investigations concerning ostrich flocks in 
Namibia and a certain ostrich farm in Swaziland, currently 
engaged in exporting ostriches to overseas markets.

Zhang Qiuming (1728 4428 2494) ] 
  [Text] Chongqing, 7 Nov (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The Three 
Gorges project on the Chang Jiang may have a great impact on the 
ecological environment along the river, and this issue has 
aroused widespread attention at home and abroad. Today, the 
State Environmental Protection Bureau set up a Chang Jiang and 
Three Gorges ecological environment monitoring network in 
Chongqing in order to more intensively and effectively monitor 
and manage the ecological environment along the Chang Jiang and 
in the Three Gorges area. 
  Wang Yangzu, deputy director of the State Environmental 
Protection Bureau, said at today's inauguration meeting that the 
establishment of such a monitoring network is a major step 
toward increasing and intensifying environmental monitoring in 
the Chang Jiang valley as a whole. The network will enable us 
to closely trace the ecological and environmental changes in the 
Chang Jiang valley while the Three Gorges project is under 
construction and after it has been completed and put into 
operation. It will promote the implementation of the measures 
for preventing ecological destruction and environmental 
pollution and will promote the restoration of the benign 
ecological environment. 
  At present, China's environmental protection institutions 
have set up more than 150 environmental monitoring stations 
along the trunk stream and tributaries of the Chang Jiang to 
monitor the atmospheric quality, acid rain levels, water 
quality, soil quality, and biological and ecological conditions. 
The Chang Jiang and Three Gorges ecological environment 
monitoring network will be developed on the basis of these 
existing monitoring stations. The first group of members of the 
network will be composed of 25 environmental monitoring stations 
in Chongqing, Yichang, Wuhan, and Shanghai.

  [Text] Xiamen, Nov 13 (XINHUA) -- The United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP) and the International Maritime 
Organization (IMO) reached an agreement on a program for East 
Asian marine pollution control here today. 
  This was the result of a meeting of representatives from 
over 
a dozen international organizations and East Asian nations to 
coordinate the fight against seawater pollution in East Asia. 
The project was sponsored by the UNDP and the Global 
Environment Foundation (GEF). 
  According to the agreement, the IMO, as an executive body of 
the agreement, will consult with East Asian countries about 
personnel training, funding, information exchange and the 
management of experimental zones. 
  The three-day meeting was held in this coastal city in East 
China's Fujian Province. 
  Three experimental zones were designated -- respectively in 
Xiamen, Malacca in Malaysia and Batangas in the Philippines -- 
to provide other East Asian countries with experience for the 
comprehensive control of coastal waters.

  [Text] Shanghai, Nov 14 (XINHUA) -- While enhancing 
environment protection, Shanghai is making efforts to expand 
production of environment protection equipment. 
  Gu Yongbo, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau 
of Environment Protection, said that now Shanghai has about 400 
enterprises and institutions engaged in the research, 
development, design and production of environment protection 
facilities with more than 7,000 senior engineers and professors. 
  The scientific development and production of the equipment 
involve nearly all spheres that can be subjected to pollution 
control. 
  By the end of 1992, Shanghai had developed more than 300 
products for pollution control and the total output value of the 
products was about 500 million yuan. 
  Some of the products were exported to developed countries 
include Japan and the United States. 
  Meanwhile, to provide technological data for the government 
to enhance pollution control and promote the development of the 
environment protection industry, the Shanghai Society of 
Environment Sciences has fulfilled a number of scientific 
consultancy programs such as ``the water diverting project on 
the upper reaches of the Huangpu river,'' ``plan for 
comprehensive control of air pollution in Shanghai,'' and 
``forecast on Shanghai's environment in the year 2000.''

  [Text] Urumqi, Nov 14 (XINHUA) -- Scientific institutes 
based in China and Kazakhstan recently held joint seminars on 
water resources and the environment of Central Asia. 
  The seminars were sponsored by the Xinjiang Geographic 
Institute, under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the 
Academy of Sciences of Kazakhstan. 
  The seminars focused on two subjects: use of water resources 
and control of mud-rock flow. 
  The seminars were held in Urumqi, capital of China's 
Xinjiang 
Uygur Autonomous Region, and Almaty, capital of Kazakhstan. 
Scientist attending the meetings visited water conservancy and 
mud- rock flow control projects in the autonomous region. 
  Xinjiang and Kazakhstan are neighbors in the desert area of 
Central Asia. Two rivers flow from Xinjiang into Kazakhstan, 
which are major water sources for Kazakhstan's inland areas. 
The two rivers are fed by melting glaciers. As the globe 
becomes warmer, glaciers have been shrinking faster rising to 
higher altitude, while the rivers have seen less water flow. 
This phenomenon poses a serious threat of water shortages in 
the region. 
  At the same time, mud-rock flows have caused large losses of 
life and property in the area. 
  The seminars were attended by 74 scientists from Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan, Kirghizstan, Russia, Japan and Germany. 
Participants put forward 83 theses on rational tapping of water 
resources and control of mud-rock flow.

  [Text] United Nations, Nov 23 (XINHUA) -- The international 
community has to make greater efforts in implementing the 
decisions of the UN Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED), a Chinese delegate said here today. 
  Cui Tiankai, a Chinese delegate to the UN Second Committee 
(Economic and Financial), told the committee that the Rio 
Declaration and Agenda 21 adopted by UNCED are milestones, but 
the consensus reached in Rio de Janeiro last year has yet to be 
translated into action. 
  ``In spite of the numerous efforts made by the international 
community in the follow-up of UNCED,'' Cui said, ``they fall far 
short of the requirements for the effective implementation of 
the various decisions of UNCED.'' 
  He said that the developed countries should fulfill their 
commitment and take practical actions by strengthening official 
development assistance and creating a favorable international 
economic environment for the economic growth of the developing 
countries. 
  The developed countries should also provide them with new 
and 
additional financial resources for environmental protection and 
transfer to them on favorable terms environmentally-sound 
technologies, said the Chinese delegate. 
  He noted that the level of official development assistance 
from the developed countries has stagnated and in some cases 
even declined in recent years. 
  This has rendered more elusive the prospects for reaching 
the 
targets on financial resources and the transfer of technology as 
set by the Rio Conference, he added. 
  ``Failure to reverse this trend is bound to erode the Rio 
consensus and reduce the agreements reached at the conference to 
a mere scrap of paper,'' he said. 
  Cui said the relevant UN working groups to be set up by the 
commission on sustainable development should conduct in-depth 
studies on the developing countries' needs for funds and 
technology. 
  These groups should also identify the obstacles to the 
access 
of the developing countries to funds and the transfer of 
technology, and come up with viable recommendations on how to 
overcome those obstacles. 
  He called on the parties concerned to reach an appropriate 
agreement on the restructuring and replenishment of the global 
environment facility so that necessary conditions can be created 
for the facility to play its expected role in the followup of 
UNCED.

  [Text] Jinan, Nov 22 (XINHUA) -- Qingdao, one of China's 14 
open coastal cities, is improving its environment with foreign 
funds. 
  The largest industrial city in Shandong Province, Qingdao 
has 
experienced rising pollution along with its rapid economic 
development. 
  To eliminate the pollution, the city has set up a leading 
organization headed by the mayor to guide environmental 
protection work, using a total of 160 million U.S. dollars 
loaned or donated by foreign governments and organizations in 
this field over the past five years, accounting for one-third of 
its total funds in the same period. 
  At present, the city has completed construction of the third 
phase of gas supply facilities and a central heating project. 
It has transformed the Qingdao power generating plant 
technically and is building more anti-pollution projects. 
  Included is the Tuandao waste water treatment plant with a 
daily capacity of 100,000 tons of waste water. 
  Upon completion, a city official noted, these projects are 
expected to help improve urban environmental quality by reducing 
air and water pollution.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xu Zhaorong (1776 0340 2837)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Nov (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zou Jiahua 
met with representatives from the United States to the ``1993 
Sino-U.S. Energy Conference'' at the Great Hall of the People 
this morning. At the meeting, the Chinese vice premier spoke 
highly of the outcome of the conference, as reflected in the 
strong desire of both sides to develop cooperation and the 
intent to sign agreements on a number of cooperative projects, 
especially a tentative plan for combining the development of 
energy industry with environmental protection. He expressed the 
hope that both Chinese and U.S. energy sectors will expand 
cooperation by pooling their respective resources under the 
premise of mutual benefit and common development. 
  The ``1993 Sino-U.S. Energy Conference'' was sponsored by 
the 
State Science and Technology Commission, the Society of American 
Chinese Engineers in the United States, and the Chinese Energy 
Society. The conference, held from 15 to 17 November in 
Beijing, is a relatively comprehensive meeting between the 
Chinese and U.S. energy sectors in recent years. Attending the 
conference from the Chinese side were 200 officials from the 
State Science and Technology Commission, the State Planning 
Commission, the State Economic and Trade Commission, electric 
power, coal, and petroleum departments, and enterprises; experts 
and scholars from universities and research institutes; and 
representatives from local energy companies. Jack Siegel, U.S. 
assistant secretary of energy, made a special trip to China to 
attend the conference on behalf of the U.S. secretary of energy. 
About 60 participants from the U.S. side attended the 
conference, including president Liang Youping of the Society of 
American Chinese Engineers, chairman Rayken [name as published] 
of the Anran [name as published] Corporation Board of Directors, 
presidents and managers of some energy corporations, and experts 
and scholars from relevant universities and research institutes. 
The conferees studied and discussed exploitation of energy and 
structural reform; energy strategies, policies, and laws; 
popularization of advanced energy technology; energy 
exploitation and environmental protection, Sino-U.S. cooperation 
in energy, and other topics of common interests. They also 
reached consensus on the intent to establish a Sino-U.S. 
association for promoting energy cooperation and development; to 
step up the pace of Sino-U.S. energy science and technology 
cooperation; to decide on more key energy cooperative projects; 
and to hold periodic seminars on energy management, legal 
framework and system, on ways for fund-raising and cooperation; 
on selection of key technical projects; and on energy pricing. 
  During the conference, Song Jian, state councillor and 
minister in charge of the State Science and Technology 
Commission, met with representatives from the United States. 
The conference ended this afternoon.

  [Text] Guangdong, Nov 16 (XINHUA) -- Painstaking efforts 
over the past eight years have raised the forest coverage rate 
to 53 percent of the land space of south China's Guangdong 
Province, official sources said here today. 
  The sources said all 106 cities and counties of the province 
have met their afforestation tasks two years ahead of the 
official completion date. 
  In the past eight years since the launch of a ten-year 
afforestation program, the province has set up thousands of 
fruit, bamboo and tea plantations, plus large areas of timber 
forests. 
  In 1987, Guangdong had accumulated more timber reserves than 
it had to consume. 
  Successful afforestation work has also brought a boom in 
industrial development in many fields. The official said the 
province's annual income from fruit and other forest products 
exceeds 400 million U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Nanchang, Nov 15 (XINHUA) -- China's first 
subtropical sand control experimental station has succeeded in 
curbing the encroachment of deserts. 
  Located near Nanchang, capital of eastern China's Jiangxi 
Province, the station has virtually stopped the invasion of the 
surrounding desert and restored the local ecological environment 
in the area after six years of work. 
  Wind and sand in the area threatened local residents' 
limited 
living space. 
  Statistics show that in Jiangxi, sandy land covers 32,000 
hectares, and that sand is swallowing farmland at a speed of 
four meters a year. 
  Experts warned that the desert was approaching the city of 
Nanchang and there was no time to waste. 
  In Houtian town, near Nanchang, people suffered greatly from 
sand disasters. Farmland and rivers were inundated, and the 
town was forced to move again and again. 
  In 1985, the town's per capita income was only 170 yuan (29 
U.S. dollars). More than 80 percent of all peasant households 
lived below the poverty line. The town owed 1.6 million yuan 
(275.9 U.S. dollars) in debts. 
  To help the backward areas out of poverty, the municipal 
science and technology committee initiated a plan of ``helping 
the poor by applying scientific and technological advances.'' 
  Cooperating with the Lanzhou Institute of Deserts in 
northwestern China's Gansu Province, the committee established 
in January of 1988 China's first experimental station on 
comprehensive exploration of subtropical sandy land. The 
station covers an area of 35.1 hectares in Houtian's most 
seriously sand-ridden area. 
  Comprehensive exploration of sandy land is a difficult 
technological project. 
  Although research on deserts and sandy land started long ago 
in northern China, this was the first time to tackle sandy land 
in subtropical areas. 
  The station adopted a method that combined modern technology 
with traditional experience. While making efforts to improve 
the environment, researchers also paid attention to economic 
results. 
  They introduced many special varieties of animals and plants 
beneficial to the environment. 
  This low-input, high-output planting mode has proved to be 
successful. About 91.3 percent of fruit trees and more than 95 
percent shelter forests have survived in the experimental area. 
  Some 93 million fruit trees of 55 varieties are growing 
there. This year, the station harvested more than 15 tons of 
fruit and earned 190 million yuan (32.76 million dollars) from 
planting. 
  Inspired by the experiment results, peasants living around 
the station planted some 200 hectares of fruit trees. Income 
per household has reached 8,000 yuan (1,380 dollars). 
  This miracle has also astonished foreign experts. At the 
third world conference on desert control, representatives from 
the Nanchang experimental station issued their research results 
and won wide recognition and appreciation from international 
sand-control experts. 
  After inspecting the station, the European Community decided 
to provide aid of 5.2 million U.S. dollars. 
  EC experts have started cooperating with Chinese experts in 
building model orchards and a personnel training base. 
  The research results will be spread around the country. 
  Experts believe that by the end of this century, the deserts 
in southern and eastern China will become oases.

  [Text] Haikou, Nov 5 (XINHUA) -- Hainan, known as ``one of 
the least polluted places on the earth,'' has been expanding 
international cooperation to explore ways to harmonize its 
economic development with environmental protection. 
  This year, the British Overseas Development Program will 
help 
Hainan draw up a plan to protect the environment in Haikou, the 
island's capital. It will also train personnel and provide 
equipment for environmental protection. 
  A German-aided sewage-treatment plant in Haikou is expected 
to go into construction next year. 
  Located in a tropical region, Hainan has a land area of 
34,000 sq km, with forest coverage of 40 percent. It also 
boasts a coastline more than 1,500 km long. No other area in 
China matches Hainan in terms of the abundance of animal, plant 
and marine resources. 
  No large-scale development was launched until five years 
ago, 
when Hainan Province was founded. 
  Since then, the island has been faced with environmental 
pollution, a drastic shrinkage of its forests and the 
deterioration of the coastal marine ecological system. 
  Whether Hainan can avoid economic growth at the expense of 
the environment, which most developed nations have experienced, 
has become a focus of concern. 
  Martin Lees, former assistant secretary general of the 
United 
Nations, has cautioned the Chinese Government of the problem of 
economic development and environmental protection. He said 
Hainan should set an example for the world by combining economic 
development with minimal damage to the environment. 
  With the help of UN organizations and other overseas 
foundations, Hainan has hosted seminars on the environment 
problem. In September of 1990, eight Chinese and eight 
international experts formed an international advisory council 
on the economic development of Hainan in harmony with the 
environment. 
  The Asian development bank allocated 600,000 U.S. dollars to 
work out a comprehensive plan for the administration of Hainan's 
environment and natural resources early this year. According to 
the plan, sewage-treatment plants will be built for a sugar 
plant and a rubber plant, in addition to a garbage disposal 
plant. A province-wide environmental monitoring network will 
also be set up.

  [Text] Beijing, Dec 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists are 
using compound materials to consolidate yellow earth and retain 
water in top soil to grow trees in the barren wasteland of 
northern China. 
  The method has been used to plant new forests on the dry and 
highly eroded loess area that stretches across north China. 
  Top soil on the Loess Plateau, which covers several northern 
provinces, is composed of loose, fine yellow earth powder. 
Water drains quickly through it and almost no moisture remains 
in the top soil. 
  Moisture in top soil drops to a low of 4.5 percent during 
the 
dry season, a period when trees are supposed to be growing. By 
using the new method, moisture in top soil has been raised to 
nine percent, adequate for trees to grow. 
  Scientists have set up three experimental forestation bases 
in North China, at which a high-molecule compound liquid is 
sprayed on the surface of soil. The glue-like liquid forms a 
water-proof layer on the surface of ground, so that rainfall can 
be diverted and pooled for irrigation. The method provides 
adequate water for tree growth. 
  Wang Binduan, a professor at the Beijing Forestry 
University, 
lead a group of scientists to carry out the experiment. 
  Wang said that his method presents hope for reclaiming 
eroded 
dry lands in North China. They have improved the survival rate 
of young trees in the area to 84-98 percent, a steep rise over 
the conventional 20 percent. The method is cheap and easy to 
use, Wang said. 
  Local people have planted over 10,000 ha of trees by using 
the new method. Most seriously eroded areas along the Yellow 
River in North China will also adopt the method. 
  Wang said that his group is experimenting with more kinds of 
trees in various landscapes. He said that it will take a 
minimum of ten years to form a proper irrigation plan for 
various types of trees.

  [Text] Tokyo, Nov 16 KYODO -- Representatives from cities 
in the Asia-Pacific region began a weeklong get-together with 
the theme ``Economic Activity and the Environment'' in Tokyo on 
Tuesday [16 November]. 
  Attending the meeting of the Asia-Pacific sister cities 
exchange are a total of 60 representatives from cities in 14 
foreign countries and 15 Japanese municipal governments, 
organizers said. 
  Under the sponsorship of the Home Affairs Ministry and the 
Foreign Ministry, the convention aims to provide a forum for the 
sister city authorities to discuss matters of mutual concern and 
to foster closer ties. 
  This is the second such Asia-Pacific exchange, organizers 
said. 
  The morning was taken up by the executive committee session 
but subcommittee meetings in the afternoon planned to discuss 
two issues -- ``economic activity and the role of self-governing 
bodies'' and ``developing consideration for the environment.'' 
  From Thursday the Japanese cities represented will host the 
delegates from their respective sister cities and the visit will 
culminate in a concluding session next Monday in Tokyo.

  [Text] At the present time, people in Kompong Chhnang 
Province do not have timber resources to live off. The forests 
in this province can only provide firewood. And now, even the 
firewood is disappearing. Nearly one-half of the population of 
the province had made a living by cutting and selling firewood 
as a permanent occupation especially in the Tuk Phos, Samakki 
Meanchey, Kompong Tralach, and Rolea Pier districts. The 
decline of the forests in Kompong Chhnang Province to the level 
where all the forests are unable to grow means that the forests 
which have been cut grow back and then are repeatedly cut. 
Therefore these forests cannot grow large. This is only one 
part of the population. Another part is a group of merchants 
who go up into the mountains to cut the big trees illegally; the 
provincial forest wardens fear this group and do not dare arrest 
them because when they leave the forest they always have 
carloads of armed guards to protect them. 
  Mr. Sarun, Deputy Chief of Agriculture responsible for 
provincial forests has reported that they do not know what steps 
to take to effectively solve this problem and keep the forest 
from further deterioration. At the present time, the Khmer 
Rouge is gradually moving to use these forests very intensively. 
And the collecting of taxes by the Khmer Rouge is increasing. 
As for the province, they have admitted to the anarchy that 
they are unable to protect the forests from destruction. When 
the Cambodian government gets new legal powers or there is an 
armed force to assist the province, only then will the province 
be effective. 
  The chief of the provincial forest wardens has pointed out 
that while the province did not have large trees to saw, there 
were sawmills in 56 locations including 16 legal mills. In the 
days of the Sangkum, there were only three sawmills in the 
province, and ll of them received timber from Pursat Province. 
Every day timber flows from Pursat Province into Kompong 
Chhnang by the hundreds of logs. The province does not know how 
to close down all these sawmills and everyone seems to be 
waiting for a change in conditions in the country. 
  As for the flood plain forests, Mr. Sarun found out that 20 
percent has been destroyed yet the provincial water products 
[department] seems not to have taken an interest in the problem 
because the prevention of the destruction of the flood plain 
forests is more dangerous than the prevention of other 
violations. Furthermore, there is the problem of planting young 
trees. It is not a ve ry effective strategy. That is, it is 
only one way without a strategy. If we spend millions of riels 
on the planting of new trees, it will not be any more useful 
than our spending money to protect the natural trees. If the 
province learns how to protect the natural trees so that they 
can grow well, it will be better than planting new trees. The 
natural trees are already there and we will only have to spend 
money to increase protection as the best solution.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- A senior environmental expert is 
warning that the government's recent deregulation package, which 
encourages industrialized nations to relocate their operations 
into Indonesia, may turn the country into a ``dump.'' 
  Otto Sumarwoto said that bringing old industrial equipment 
into Indonesia will not only cause pollution problems, but will 
also be economically inefficient. 
  ``Moreover, the public's growing concern on environmental 
problems will become a threat to the operation of such old 
industrial facilities. Their products can, in the long run, be 
also completely rejected on the international markets,'' Otto 
said referring to the government's new investment policy, which 
is partly designed to attract the sunset industries of more 
developed nations into Indonesia. 
  The importation of second hand plant-equipment was 
previously 
banned in Indonesia, but has been made possible by the new 
package. He warned that the government should be more cautious 
in licensing such old industries, as their operations will not 
only cause environmental problems but also create a high cost 
economy. 
  ``Their operations will not only be inefficient but are also 
under a threat in the long term, in line with the public's 
growing concern about environmental problems,'' he said. 
  He said the government should have a long-term perspective 
in 
drawing a policy so that its negative impacts can be minimized 
  The government, as part of the deregulatory measures issued 
last month, also allows foreign investors to own 100 percent of 
the equity of an industrial company producing intermediary 
products, raw materials and semi finished products, with paid-up 
capital of only U.S. $2 million. 
  Minister of Industry Tunk Ariwibowo said the move is an 
important breakthrough taken by the government to attract the 
relocation of industries from more developed nations. 
  The restriction on the importation of second hand machinery 
equipment and other capital goods was abolished as part of the 
government's package to encourage the relocation of more 
developed nations' industries into the country. 
  Otto estimated that industries relocated into Indonesia will 
survive only within five years because after that period they 
will no longer be able to compete due to their rising production 
costs.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``The Indorayon Lesson''] </F>
  [Text] For those who believe that economic considerations 
alone can determine the failure or success of a business 
investment, the string of protests which the North Sumateran 
pulp and paper factory, PT [Company Limited] Inti Indorayon 
Utama, has had to endure ever since the beginning of its 
operations in 1989 should provide convincing proof to the 
contrary. 
  Many of us probably remember the furor that arose a few 
years 
ago over the alleged contamination by the factory of village 
water resources in the Porsea area, about 200 kilometers 
southwest of Medan, where the plant is located. The agitation 
died down after assurances by high-ranking officials that the 
plant had done what needed to be done to ensure a clean 
environment. The incident developed into the first 
environment-related court case in which charges were pressed, 
although without success, against an alleged offender by the 
public, represented in this case by the Indonesian Environmental 
Forum (Walhi). 
  Complaints of environmental pollution and indiscriminate 
logging have since emerged off and on, although the company has 
disclaimed allegations that its felling of trees has caused a 
drop in the water level in Lake Toba, which feeds the Asahan, 
one of the major rivers of North Sumatra. 
  Nobody, however, could have foreseen the vehemence of the 
massive protest that occurred on Saturday, 6 November, after 
what was reported to be an explosion at the plant set off panic 
among villagers living nearby. 
  Newspaper reports quoted one of the PT Indorayon directors 
as 
saying the explosion involved one of the factory's three 
bleaching tanks, each of which contained several hundred 
kilograms of chlorine. As white smoke billowed from the damaged 
installation, fear of another Bhopal incident triggered panic in 
Porsea and thousands of villagers fled to safer areas at 
Siborong-borong Tarutung and Parapat. 
  Later, into the night, hordes of enraged villagers forced 
their way past the outnumbered security guards into the 
compound, smashing everything in their path. The hysteria 
receded for a while, when factory officials agreed to speak with 
the villagers. 
  But some time later, scores of the terrified villagers 
returned, demanding that the plant be closed for good as they 
set houses ablaze and vandalized the factory. Informal local 
community leaders had to be called in to restore calm and order 
at the site of the violence. 
  In Jakarta, reports of the unrest motivated a member of the 
House of Representatives to urge the company to suspend 
operations until a thorough investigation could be conducted and 
proper safety measures taken. 
  As the company's general manager for corporate affairs, 
Brett 
Hutton, later explained in Jakarta, the ferocity of the 
villagers' reaction was the result of ``wild rumors fanned by 
parties including the Medan press'' about the dangers of the gas 
leakage. ``The explosion concerned a very small pipe. It let 
out some gas but basically posed no danger to anyone. It was 
fixed very quickly,'' Hutton said. He also said the company had 
made a policy of fostering good relations with the community, 
``as attested by the award it won last year for its efforts in 
this area.'' 
  To judge by the constant public complaints about its 
operations, however, it is apparent that still more effort is 
needed. 
  Our mention of the Indorayon case, of course, serves merely 
as an illustration of the importance of considering other than 
economic factors in any undertaking in which community 
acceptance can play such a decisive role. Surely, the recent 
Porsea incident can serve as an important lesson for not only 
Indorayon, but for any businessman about to invest his money in 
Indonesia.

  [Text] Ambon, Dec 01 (OANA/ANTARA) -- In the last five 
years, Japan has provided 30,114,600 rupiahs in aid [word 
indistinct] of identical environment sanitation projects (PLPP) 
in several rural and urban areas as well as in Masohi, the 
principal city of central Maluku district. 
  On the road construction section, the official of the public 
works office, Ir. Buchan Simanjuntak said here on Wednesday that 
the Japanese loan had among other things been useful for waste 
water treatment. 
  According to Simanjuntak, expenses for PPLP development in 
central Maluku in the last five years have reached 581,995,158 
rupiahs. Of that amount 551,880,558 rupiahs have been made 
available from the national budget and the remaining 30,114,600 
rupiahs have been provided as loan by Japan -- particularly for 
the construction of a 720-meter long primary drainage system in 
Ampere sub-district in Amahai district, which was surveyed by a 
team of the Maluku legislative council some time ago. Expenses 
reached [word indistinct] million rupiahs allocated from the 
national budget. 
  The team of the provincial legislative council also surveyed 
a project for the improvement of clean water facilities in 
Amahai district which will be funded from the 1993/1994 budget, 
Simandjuntak said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Nov 15 KYODO -- Japan will outline a clear 
policy for conserving its forests through sustainable management 
at a board meeting of the International Timber Organization 
(ITTO) in Yokohama Tuesday [16 November], Forestry Agency 
sources said Monday. 
  Yoshio Hironaka, head of the agency's guidance division, 
will 
articulate Japan's wish to tackle forest depletion at home as 
well as abroad, the sources said. 
  Hironaka will explain that sustainable timber management 
continues to be a prime conservation goal of the government, 
they said. 
  Such management involves protecting existing forests and 
replanting felled areas while still making economic progress. 
  The ITTO member countries agreed at a meeting in June last 
year to promote sustainable forest management worldwide and not 
just in tropical regions. 
  European countries, the United States and Canada have 
already 
pledged to act on the agreement, the sources said. 
  The agency hopes that Japan's commitment will facilitate 
stalled talks between advanced and developing countries over 
revising the international tropical timber agreement which 
expires next March, they said. 
  The ITTO meeting in Yokohama started November 10 and 
continues until Wednesday with government and nongovernment 
representatives from countries producing or consuming tropical 
timber.

  [Text] Tokyo, Nov 16 KYODO -- The government plans to 
launch a campaign to encourage the public to adopt an 
environment-friendly lifestyle in line with proposals adopted at 
the Earth Summit in June last year, according to a draft report 
released Tuesday [16 November]. 
  The draft action plan contains measures to implement 
``Agenda 
21,'' which was agreed on at the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro. The 
draft plan cites six priority measures Japan hopes to implement 
to ensure a more environment-friendly atmosphere. 
  According to the draft plan, Japan will make efforts to 
build 
a society capable of sustainable development while causing 
little havoc on the global environment. 
  Japan intends to actively contribute to the establishment of 
an international legal framework on global environmental 
conservation and join international efforts to improve a 
financial contribution mechanism, including reform of the global 
environment facility, for conservation measures, the report said. 
  Priority will also be placed on contributing to developing 
countries to help raise their capability to cope with 
environmental problems, according to the draft. 
  Japan will promote the development of environment-related 
technology and technology transfers, and appropriately and 
systematically implement official development assistance, the 
draft said. 
  Other priorities include securing international cooperation 
for observation, monitoring and investigative research on global 
environmental conservation and strengthening effective ties 
among the central and local governments, enterprises and 
nongovernmental organizations, it said. 
  The ``Agenda 21'' included suggestions on how each country 
should prepare an action plan to implement the measures. The 
Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations agreed at the 1992 
Munich Summit and the Tokyo Summit meeting last July to draw up 
and publish their respective action plans by the year-end. 
  The government hopes to hear opinions on the draft from the 
public and issue a final report by that deadline after 
adjustments, the Foreign Ministry said.

  [Text] Yokohama, Nov 16 KYODO -- The sustainability of 
Japan's forest management policy was the subject of disagreement 
between the government and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) 
at a board meeting of the International Tropical Timber 
Organization (ITTO) Tuesday [16 November]. 
  Yoshio Hironaka, head of the Forestry Agency's Guidance 
Division, told the ITTO session that it is the government's wish 
to tackle forest depletion at home as well as abroad. 
  Hironaka outlined to the board a policy for conserving 
Japan's forests, saying that sustainable timber management 
continues to be a prime conservation goal of the government. 
  ``Japan has established goals for forest conservation and 
sustainable forest management and has been achieving these goals 
in various systems,'' Hironaka said. ``We will maintain this 
goal and continue implementing sustainable management of our 
forests.'' 
  But in a statement to the ITTO board on behalf of a 
coalition 
of five consumer and environmental organizations, Kazuko Matsue, 
a member of the Sarawak Campaign Committee, said the agency's 
effort to lower its debt by cutting the forestry work force is 
leaving plantations understaffed and causing a drop in timber 
quality. 
  The statement said the widespread conversion of the nation's 
forests into single species tracts is starving the forests of 
biodiversity and decreasing the nation's store of natural 
forests. 
  It said Japan's resort law has led to the construction of 
golf courses and resorts totaling 5 million hectares and 
``causing the clearing of vast areas of natural forests, 
especially beech.'' 
  The statement said Japanese timber cannot compete with 
low-priced wood from Canada, the United States, Indonesia, and 
Malaysia, while imports of timber are causing ``devastation'' in 
Southeast Asia, North America, and Siberia. 
  It called for the ITTO to monitor the trade in boreal and 
temperate timber as well as tropical timber. 
  The weeklong ITTO meeting began November 10 at its 
headquarters in Yokohama. Participants are discussing measures 
to achieve sustainable management of tropical forests by 2000. 
  Tropical timber producing countries from Asia, Africa and 
Latin America, and consumer countries such as Japan, the U.S., 
European Community (EC) nations, Russia and China are attending 
the ITTO board of directors' meeting and standing committee 
meeting. 
  Government representatives from 49 ITTO member countries are 
also attending. Officials from international organizations and 
nongovernmental organizations are present as observers. 
  The Yokohama-based ITTO consists of 23 producing countries 
such as Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Malaysia, Indonesia and India, 
and 26 consumer nations including Australia, Canada, China, 
Japan, Germany, France and the U.S.

  [Text] Cairo, Nov 16 KYODO -- Japan told an international 
conference on Middle East environmental problems Tuesday [16 
November] it will contribute $530,000 to a program aimed at 
halting desertification. 
  Japan made the offer at the fourth meeting of a working 
group 
on the environment, one of five working groups operating in the 
multilateral track of the current Middle East peace process. 
  The startup funds would go toward a $9 million 
desertification control program proposed by the International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. 
  Japan served as the chair country for the meeting, at which 
it was decided to hold a meeting next February in Cairo to draft 
a set of standardized basic principles or ``codes of conduct'' 
for regional governments to adhere to when dealing with 
environmental issues. 
  Also considered was the establishment of an environmental 
agency by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories set 
to be self-administered under the recent accord between Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
  Forty-three countries and two international organizations 
participated in the meeting. Syria and Lebanon skipped the 
session.

  [Text] Tokyo, Nov 19 KYODO -- Tokyo bay's water quality 
improved significantly in 1992, with the environmental quality 
standard increasing 10.5 percentage points over the previous 
year to 73.7 percent, Environment Agency officials said Friday. 
  The officials cited improved sewage systems along side 
rivers 
flowing into the bay. They also said the sewage treatment rate 
improved to around 65 percent in fiscal 1990 compared with 43 
percent in fiscal 1979. 
  The agency surveyed chemical oxygen demand as the indicator 
of water pollution in the bay. 
  The Tokyo Bay assessment was released Friday as part of an 
annual nationwide survey of water pollution in lakes, rivers and 
seas. 
  The quality standard in western Japan's Seto Inland Sea 
stood 
at 78.2 percent in 1992, the same as the previous year, the 
survey said. 
  The national average quality standard in sea areas hit 80.9 
percent, a slight increase of 0.7 percentage point over the 
previous year, according to the survey. 
  The average river water quality standard stood at the same 
level as the previous year, 75.4 percent, it said. 
  The quality standard for lakes and marshes improved by 2.3 
percentage points to 44.6 percent, the survey reported.

  [Text] Fukuoka, Nov 23 KYODO -- Representatives from 16 
prefectures facing the Sea of Japan proposed Tuesday [23 
November] holding a governors' summit in 1994 to discuss 
preservation of the environment and establishment of a social 
infrastructure in the region. 
  The proposal was made in a statement issued Tuesday at the 
end of a forum sponsored by the Social Democratic Party (SDP), 
the largest of seven parties in the ruling coalition. 
  The statement also called on the government, local 
autonomous 
bodies and universities to undertake studies to safeguard the 
environment and promote management of fishery resources. 
  The SDP hopes to convene the sea of Japan governors' summit 
around next June, a party official said. The party has already 
gained basic endorsement for the summit plan, the official said. 
  The governors of Fukuoka and Hokkaido, the largest of the 16 
prefectures facing the Sea of Japan, have both won elections 
under the SDP's backing. 
  During the two-day forum attended by some 220 people, 
academics, prefectural and municipal officials, international 
exchange experts, and fishery representatives discussed a wide 
range of themes concerning regional exchanges and development. 
  The Sea of Japan rim prefectures range from Hokkaido in the 
north to Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki Prefectures in the south. 
  Development in those prefectures, particularly on Honshu 
island, is far behind that of prefectures facing the Pacific 
which include Japan's three biggest business centers of Tokyo, 
Osaka and Nagoya.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec 4 KYODO -- Tokyo and Beijing have agreed 
to conclude a bilateral agreement on environmental cooperation 
focusing on measures to check acid rain, government sources said 
Saturday [4 December]. 
  The agreement is expected to be signed when a top Japanese 
Government leader visits China, the sources said. The date of 
the leader's visit to China has not yet been fixed. 
  Air pollution in rapidly industrializing China is believed 
to 
be partly responsible for acid rain in East Asia. Sulfur 
dioxide, nitrogen and other acid rain-causing emissions 
originate from the burning of fossil fuel, such as coal and oil. 
  Acid rain damages buildings, kills fish by acidifying lakes 
and rivers, and is believed to be fatal to trees. 
  Japan has sealed similar environmental agreements with the 
United States and South Korea, but the accord with China is the 
first to refer explicitly to the problem of acid rain. 
  The government places high hopes in the joint battle against 
acid rain, all the more since Beijing and Seoul vowed 
cooperation on air pollution in an agreement in October. 
  ``Together with the Japan-Korea agreement on environment 
protection we will be able to proceed on a trilateral basis with 
joint acid rain research and counter-measures,'' an Environment 
Agency official said. 
  The agreement will also stipulate regular consultations to 
set up a network of survey stations to measure air pollutants in 
line with a five-year agency project, which aims at determining 
how much of Asia's acid rain originates from Chinese and South 
Korean emissions. 
  China released 160,000 tons of sulfur oxide into the air in 
1991, according to the Chinese Government, an amount 15 times 
greater than that released by Japan. 
  While the Chinese Government concedes that sulfur dioxide 
emissions will continue to increase with the country's rapid 
economic growth, it questions whether domestic pollution affects 
other countries. 
  ``We have a lot of acid rain in China, too, but I don't 
think 
that pollutants from China cause acid rain in Japan,'' Xie 
Zhenhua, director of China's State Environmental Protection 
Bureau, said recently in dismissing such allegations. 
  Jiro Kondo, chairman of the Japan Science Council, welcomed 
the agreement as ``basically good,'' but warned of a biased 
approach to acid rain. 
  ``Actually, desulfurization devices and other technological 
support are necessary. Cooperation will only be fruitful if we 
avoid viewing Japan as the country suffering from pollution, 
while terming China the polluter,'' said Kondo. 
  Meanwhile, officials at the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry (MITI) voiced misgivings the envisaged treaty could 
cause. A conflict of responsibilities among government bodies 
could arise, if existing MITI projects in China are included in 
the framework. 
  MITI started environmental dialogue with China's State 
Planning Commission in April 1992 and supports the country with 
an annual amount of 6 billion yen for testing of desulfurization 
and smoke filtration plants and the dispatch of experts. 
  If subject to the treaty, MITI projects would require 
approval by the Foreign Ministry and the Environment Agency. 
Officials fear that the time-consuming procedures -- often more 
than two years from application to the final approval -- would 
hamper an effective and flexible response to China's 
environmental problems.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec 3 KYODO -- A survey showing higher levels 
of acid rain on the Sea of Japan side of the country than on its 
Pacific coast proves Japan should cooperate with countries on 
the Asian mainland as possible sources of the contaminants, 
scientists said Friday [3 December]. 
  Environmental divisions of local government administrations 
throughout Japan cooperated on the survey, the first of its kind 
to collate data from 158 sites between Hokkaido in the north and 
Okinawa in the south. 
  National surveys conducted by the environment agency since 
1983 have been more limited in scope, including data from only 
29 sites. 
  The new survey findings clearly show higher levels of acid 
rain on the Japan sea side of the mountain range which runs 
through the center of Honshu Island compared to areas on the 
Pacific coast side. 
  The findings show that northern Japan and mountainous 
regions 
experience an ``acid shock'' in spring when snows melt and 
release highly acidic substances into streams and rivers. 
  The results point to a need to document the effects of this 
on the environment. 
  A total of 63 environmental centers cooperated on the survey 
between April 1991 and March 1992. 
  They sampled acid levels and amounts of sulphuric acid and 
nitric acid content in rain and snow. 
  Average pH levels, a measure of acidity and alkalinity, 
ranged between 4.3 and 4.9. Numbers from 7 downward on the 
scale indicate increasing acidity, while numbers upward from 7 
indicate increasing alkalinity. A figure of 5.6 is accepted as 
normal. 
  Among 39 sample sites which could not be expected to receive 
any pollution from domestic urban areas, the Hokuriku region 
around the Noto peninsula in particular experienced more than 15 
millimeters of sulphuric acid-containing precipitation per 
square meter over a 30- day period in the winter. 
  This was more than three times the lowest levels in the 
survey, which were found in Hokkaido. 
  With the exception of parts of Aomori Prefecture, other 
areas 
from the Tohoku Region in the north and stretching across to the 
Sanin region, central Kyushu and the western part of Shikoku 
Island, all received large amounts of rain containing higher 
than normal levels of sulphuric acid. 
  The high sulphuric acid content in rain in Kyushu is 
attributable to volcanic activity, but scientists who conducted 
the survey said that on the Japan sea side of the country in 
particular, there is a strong likelihood the acid has been 
brought by prevailing westerly winds.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec 3 KYODO -- The quality of air improved in 
general throughout the nation in fiscal 1992 but deteriorated in 
metropolitan areas, according to a report filed Friday [3 
December] by the Environment Agency. 
  Levels of five air pollutants, including nitrogen oxide and 
suspended particulate matter (SPM), were measured by general 
monitoring stations in residential areas, and by special 
automobile exhaust monitors along the nation's highways. 
  Less than half of the monitoring stations in Tokyo, Osaka 
and 
other metropolitan areas recorded levels of nitrogen oxide below 
the environmentally safe standard. 
  Throughout the nation, 97.4 percent of the general 
monitoring 
stations and 71.4 percent of the highway monitors recorded a 
level of nitrogen oxide below the environmental standard of 0.06 
parts per million. 
  The figures show an improvement of 3.3 percentage points at 
general monitoring stations and 8.6 percentage points at highway 
monitors over the previous year. 
  In Tokyo and the Osaka-Kobe region, however, only 46.1 
percent of the highway monitoring stations recorded levels at or 
below the environmental standard, even with tougher automobile 
exhaust laws in those areas. 
  The number of highway monitors failing to reach the 
environmental standard increased in Aichi, Kyoto, Okayama, 
Hiroshima, Fukuoka, and Nagasaki, suggesting air pollution is 
spreading in those metropolitan areas. 
  Meanwhile, the number of monitoring stations recording safe 
levels of SPM increased by 7.9 points to 57.6 percent, and by 
3.4 points at highway monitoring stations to 33.5 percent. 
  The environmental standard is a daily average of less than 
0.1 milligrams of SPM per 1 cubic meter. 
  Tokyo, Gunma, Saitama and Yamanashi failed to have a single 
monitoring station record the recommended standard. 
  Exhaust from diesel engines is said to cause 20 to 40 
percent 
of the SPM in the atmosphere.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec 2 KYODO -- Japan will loan up to 8.15 
billion yen to Argentina to support the nation's efforts to 
improve the environment, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said 
Thursday [2 December]. 
  Hosokawa made the pledge in a meeting with Argentine 
President Carlos Menem, according to Foreign Ministry officials. 
  The loan will be provided for Argentina's program to improve 
sanitary conditions along the Reconquista River, which runs 
north of the capital of Buenos Aires, the officials said. 
  The loan is part of Japan's plan to expand its Official 
Development Assistance (ODA) to 900 billion to 1 trillion yen 
over a five-year period from 1992. 
  Tokyo expressed its intention to expand its ODA at the U.N. 
Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in June last 
year, they said. 
  The loan will be extended in cooperation with the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), they said.

  [Text] Pyongyang, Nov 20 (KCNA) -- The DPRK State 
Environmental Committee issued a statement today denouncing 
Russia and Japan for continuously dumping nuclear waste 
massively to destroy the sea environment and seriously threaten 
the existence of the population in the littoral areas. 
  The statement urged that the incumbent authorities of Japan 
and Russia should promptly stop the criminal acts of dumping 
nuclear waste into the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific Ocean 
and, at the same time, remove the already dumped nuclear waste 
from the sea without delay and punish those responsible for it. 
  ``If Russia and Japan continue with their illegal nuclear 
waste dumping in disregard of the aspiration of mankind for 
environmental protection of the earth, they would be held wholly 
responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom,'' warned 
the statement. 
  Recalling that Russia and Japan have annually dumped a large 
amount of nuclear waste into the East Sea of Korea and the 
Pacific Ocean illegally, it says: 
  ``Such acts of Russia and Japan are a breach of the 
international conventions on protection and conservation of the 
sea environment; they are criminal acts of polluting and 
wrecking the sea environment and jeopardizing the lives of the 
population in the littoral countries.'' 
  ``To protect and conserve the sea environment is a unanimous 
demand of the peoples in the littoral areas. And it is already 
stipulated under international agreement that radioactive waste, 
even less activated one, can never be dumped into the sea.'' 
  ``Moreover, Russia and Japan, as signatories to the London 
conventions, are obligated to strive for the prevention of sea 
pollution.'' 
  ``This notwithstanding, they are not only vyingly dumping 
nuclear waste but also releasing at random even liquid 
radioactive pollutants. We cannot but take a serious note of 
it.'' 
  ``Such acts of Russia and Japan destroying the earth 
environment now are causing deep apprehensions and protests from 
the peoples in Asia and the rest of the world and environmental 
organizations.'' 
  ``It is ridiculous, indeed, of Russia and Japan to 
vociferously urge us to `comply with the Nuclear Safeguards 
Agreement', while openly violating the international 
conventions, an act reminding us of a thief crying `stop 
thief!''' 
  ``Japan must not try impudently to cover up its wicked acts 
in quickening its pace toward nuclear armament by taking issue 
with others, but give up the nuclear armament. And Russia, too, 
had better control its own nuclear weapons properly, instead of 
joining force in slinging mud at other countries, only bringing 
disgrace on itself.'' 
  ``The DPRK State Environmental Committee expresses the hope 
that the international organisations concerned and the 
governments of all countries will pay due attention to it and 
exercise their influence so that nobody ever can destroy the 
ecological environment of the East Sea of Korea and the Pacific 
Ocean.''

  [Text] Seoul, Nov 19 (YONHAP) -- The Working-Level 
Environment Conservation Committee approved a proposal Friday to 
expand Korea's natural ecosystem conservation area from 91 
square kilometers to 5,000 square kilometers, or 5 percent of 
the whole area of the country, by 2003. 
  Under the 10-year basic plan for environmental conservation, 
prepared by the Environment Ministry, the ministry will 
designate more than 40 percent of the virgin forest, woods and 
grassy plains in Korea ``green track of land conservation 
areas'' and more than 20 places rich in indigenous flora and 
fauna will be named ``natural ecosystem protection areas.'' 
  Under the plan, the ministry will put forth an optimum ``per 
capita ratio of urban green areas'' and will, based thereon, 
work out area-by-area master plans for the expansion of green 
areas. 
  The plan also calls for the creation of a national pavilion 
for preservation of biological resources at 40 billion won (44 
million U.S. dollars) to house about 10 million specimens, and 
to set up a biological variety research institute. 
  The plan also includes a project to study and manage the 
natural environment of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) jointly with 
North Korea.

  [Text] Malaysia and Indonesia will jointly safeguard 
environment of the Straits of Melaka by enhancing coordination 
of the existing working mechanism. Defense Minister Datuk Sri 
Najib Tun Razak said this in a joint news conference at the end 
of the 22d meeting of the Malaysia-Indonesia General Border 
Committee in Kuala Lumpur. The Indonesian side was represented 
by the chief of the Armed Forces, General Feisal Tanjung. 
  Datuk Sri Najib also said both countries will consider 
creating duty-free zones at border areas as part of a program to 
stimulate trade exchanges. Both sides noted that there have 
been an increasing number of smuggling activities and pollution 
incidents in the straits. Cases of piracy, however, have been 
reduced significantly. The next General Border Committee 
meeting of the two countries will be held in Jakarta in November 
next year.

  [Text] Batangas Bay has been chosen as one of three pilot 
areas in Asia to showcase a marine pollution management project 
geared at helping mitigate pollution damage in East Asian seas. 
  Once fully operational, it will be the first program of its 
kind where pollution and its risks are confronted and studied in 
depth for more systematic and effective management. 
  Cosponsored by the United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the project 
will have an initial funding of $8 billion. 
  The two other projects will be piloted in Xiamen Bay in 
China 
and Malacca Strait in Malaysia. 
  The project is designed to strengthen East Asia's capability 
in marine pollution management by demonstrating the 
effectiveness of an integrated coastal zone management approach. 
  The mechanism provides a conceptual framework within which 
the cumulative, multisectoral environmental consequences of 
industrialization can be managed to remain within tolerable 
limits. 
  With the project in place, rapidly industrializing countries 
in East Asia will have an idea on managing marine resources on a 
sustainable basis. 
  The program will support the development of a regional 
marine 
pollution information management and monitoring network. 
  It also seeks to strengthen the capacity of the region and 
the countries to enforce and comply with international 
conventions in controlling marine pollution. 
  Equally important, the project also aims to initiate 
sustainable financing options for marine pollution management. 
  The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) 
will play the lead role in the project's implementation. 
  DENR is hopeful the project can also mitigate pollution 
damage in the waters of Manila Bay, Lingayen Bay, Tanon Strait, 
Calancan Bay, and Iligan Bay. 
  DENR's Robert Jara told BUSINESS WORLD one of the reasons 
Batangas Bay was chosen as a pilot area was on the active role 
of government and the private sector in protecting the bay's 
marine resources.

  [Text] Academics and officials concerned about water 
quality have urged the installation of waste water treatment 
systems in communities and agricultural areas to reduce 
pollution. 
  Suwan Ngamsutthi, the chief of Ayutthaya's public health and 
environment office, told THE NATION that water from the Chao 
Phya River in Ayutthaya province was almost unusable. 
  The bio-oxygen demand (BOD) level, which measures oxygen 
depletion, of the river in Ayutthaya was currently three. 
  If the BOD reached level four the water became unusable. 
  He said the main source of pollution was waste water 
draining 
from communities. 
  All factories were required to have a waste treatment 
systems, and officials from the Department of Industry checked 
to ensure that industrial waste did not drain into rivers or 
canals. 
  Communities were much more difficult to control, Suwan said. 
  He said residents had complained that the NMB [expansion 
unknown] company was draining its waste water into the Chao Phya 
River. 
  However, checks showed that the company's discharge was 
within safety limits. 
  His office had suggested that NMB recycle its treated waste 
water through washrooms before discharging it, and the company 
had complied. 
  There were 11 water testing laboratories in Ayutthaya and 
BOD 
levels in the province were tested every three months. In 
previous years the BOD levels in Ayutthaya had never been higher 
than two. 
  This year the pollution level during the crisis months -- 
February, March and April -- had peaked at five. 
  At this time the river was fit only for transportation. 
  Suwan said his office had to carefully manage the water 
quality of the Chao Phya, because from Ayutthaya it flowed to 
Bangkok and would worsen the problems in the capital if it was 
already badly polluted. 
  For this reason, the Ayutthaya province had launched a 
public 
relations campaign urging people to understand the problem of 
water quality. 
  Pathum Thani Governor Sirat Harirak also blamed the poor 
condition of the Chao Phya river on urban drainage. 
  Srirat said it was not practical for each house to install a 
treatment system, because of the cost and size of a plant. 
Instead, communities should install large treatment plants to 
handle urban and village waste. 
  Pathum Thani province had this year begun building community 
water treatment systems in Kukot and Prachathipat municipality 
and Klong Luang. 
  Once the provincial government building plans were 
completed, 
the problem of water quality in his province would be resolved. 
  Thepphanom Muangmaen, a specialist in environment at Mahidon 
University told THE NATION that water treatment would certainly 
improve water quality, but officials must also be honest in 
evaluating the plants' efficiency. 
  Wichan Wongwiwat, the director of the public health 
engineering division and the Public Work Department's office of 
water treatment, said the condition of water in southern section 
of the Chao Phya was very poor, especially in the dry season. 
  He warned that the pollution could extend up the river to 
the 
northern section unless something was done about it. 
  Wicham said even sea water was showing signs of pollution. 
  Bacterial and heavy metal pollution along the eastern coast, 
the upper south eastern coast and the western coast of Phuket 
was higher than normal. 
  Wichan said the Public Works Department had been studying 
the 
problem of waste water disposal in big cities, such as Chiang 
Mai, since 1981. 
  The department was building water supply, drainage and 
treatment systems and garbage disposal systems in 41 areas. 
  These projects would be extended to 40 more areas next year. 
  Dr. Nattha Hingsanarumon, a lecturer of the Thammasat 
University's Faculty of Science and Technology, said water 
treatment systems would effectively lower pollution from urban 
sources, but they must be built in a suitable site. 
  Water treatment plants should also be built in agricultural 
areas.

  [Text] Deputy Industry Minister Phonthep Techaphaibul 
yesterday urged developed countries which are parties to the 
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer to 
help replenish the Multilateral Fund. 
  Financial assistance is essential for developing countries' 
efforts to phase out their use of ozone-depleting substances, he 
asserted. 
  The Montreal Protocol is an international agreement on the 
protection of ozone layer which filters the harmful ultraviolet 
rays from reaching the earth's surface. 
  K.M. Sarma, Coordinator of the Ozone Secretariat, told 
participants at the Preparatory Meeting of the Fifth Meeting of 
the Parties to the Montreal Protocol--which opened in Bangkok 
yesterday--that contributions to the Multilateral Fund are still 
behind pledges. 
  Speaking on behalf of the Executive Director of the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Mr. Sarma urged the 
Governments of the countries which ``could pay but did not pay'' 
to make their contributions as soon as possible. 
  Mr. Phonthep, in his opening speech, said the provision of 
adequate funding is important to developing countries 
constrained by their technologies and financial resources in 
eliminating the production and consumption of ozone-destroying 
chemicals. 
  Thailand is listed in the so-called Article 5 Paragraph 1 
countries which are eligible for financial assistance from the 
Multilateral Fund for projects to phase out the use of 
substances that damage the ozone layer. 
  Mr. Phonthep said the Thai Government has already taken 
various measures to discourage the use of such substances, 
including promoting public awareness on the danger of ozone 
destruction and encouraging people to help save the ozone. 
  Mr. Sarma said the requirements of the Multilateral Fund for 
1994, 1995 and 1996 are a vital issue of discussion at the 
Bangkok meeting. 
  According to Mr. Sarma, it has already been agreed that the 
requirement for the next three years will be between U.S. $340 
and $500 million. 
  He stressed this requirement must be met so developing 
countries can achieve their goals of phasing out their use of 
ozone damaging substances as early as posslble. 
  ``The less cash we put in now, the more the consumption of 
the developing countries will increase.'' 
  ``And ultimately it is the contributors to the Fund who have 
to bear the burden of the cost of phasing out a much larger 
quantity of the controlled substances,'' he said. 
  Mr. Sarma said although there have been reports that the 
Montreal Protocol is working splendidly and that the extent of 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), a chief ozone-eating agent, is 
coming down as control measures take effect, he still did not 
want the people to be complacent. 
  ``This is not the time to pat ourselves on the back and 
assume that we have succeeded in our task,'' he said. 
  Mr. Sarma said the news about the ozone layer continues to 
be 
depressing. 
  In 1992, the Antarctic hole was at its largest and ozone has 
been depleted by 60 percent. The destruction was also 
significant in the northern latitudes. 
  In 1993, the record low ozone values over Antarctica 
reported 
in September were the lowest ever reported for that month. 
  These values have continued into early October, he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``Thai Industrial Standards Institute </F>
Allows Objections to Limits on Diesel Pollution''] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Mr. Chen Bunsong, the 
Secretary-General of the Thai Industrial Standards Institute 
[ISI] said that with regard to the ISI controlling pollutants 
from all new automobiles and motorcycles, the limits would not 
be stricter than the standards set by the ISI to control air 
pollution. He announced that standards for level one motorcycles 
with MOK [registered weight in kg] 1105 to 2535 had taken effect 
as of 10 August. Preparations were being made to announce the 
pollution standards for gasoline-powered, level two automobiles 
with MOK 1120 to 2535 soon. The ISI was preparing to control 
pollutants from diesel vehicles more strictly. The pollution 
standards for small, level one diesel vehicles had been set 
already. 
  Mr. Chen said that these safety standards covered amounts of 
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen allowed for 
diesel vehicles with not more than nine seats, diesel trucks 
with a gross vehicle weight of not more than 3,500 kg, and 
passenger vehicles made from trucks with a gross vehicle weight 
of not more than 3,500 kg with no limit set on the number of 
seats. In any case before this was given the stamp of an 
official decree so that it could be announced as the standard of 
the ISI, an opportunity would be given for manufacturers and 
others involved who wished to object to present objections 
together with the reasons to the ISI on or before 7 October. 
  The following table shows the quantity of carbon monoxide, 
the quantity of hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen, and the 
quantity of oxides of nitrogen from the engine of a vehicle with 
six seats or less and with a gross vehicle weight of 2,500 kg or 
less. This is for the certification test. Units are in grams per 
test.

  [Text] Success claimed in the global reduction of 
ozone-depleting substances were marred by charges from 
Greenpeace International that use of so-called ``interim'' 
substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) suggested under the 
Montreal Protocol would even worsen the ozone loss. 
  The international environment organisation said yesterday 
substitutes for ozone-depleting CFCs, such as 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 
were themselves harmful to the global environment. 
  HCFCs, used as substitutes for CFCs in producing foam 
insulation for household refrigerators and in commercial 
refrigeration, destroy stratospheric ozone. The chemicals are 
subject to phase-out by the year 2030 in industrialised nations. 
  Greenpeace said HCFCs produced now would add to ozone layer 
depletion in the next 10 to 20 years and claimed that any 
additional use of these substances is environmentally 
irresponsible. 
  HFCs, promoted as alternatives to CFCs, cause global 
warming. 
According to Greenpeace one kilogramme of HFC134a has the 
global warming potential of 3,200 kilogrammes of carbon dioxide, 
the major greenhouse gas. 
  It said environmentally safe alternatives, which exist, 
should be preferred as substitutes for CFCs over these 
``interim'' substitutes. 
  Greenpeace yesterday claimed that parties to the Montreal 
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer were falling 
back on their commitment to protect the ozone layer. 
  ``Despite some progress made on funding for ozone-friendly 
technology transfer and development in developing nations, the 
parties appear to be backsliding on their most fundamental 
objective -- phasing out all ozone-depleting chemicals and 
bringing on line environmentally-sound technology as rapidly as 
possible,'' said Michael Affleck, Greenpeace International ozone 
coordinator. 
  Mr. Affleck said efforts to establish firm criteria for 
adopting permanent, ozone-friendly alternatives rather than 
interim chemical substances that have adverse environmental 
impact might have been blocked in some developing countries 
which were able to secure renewed and increased funding for 
technological transfer to phase-out CFCs. 
  He said it was developed nations which would benefit from 
the 
transfer of technology. These countries, mainly the producers 
of the interim substitutes and exporters of the technology, 
would be able to take back their money contributed to the 
Multilateral Fund through the selling of the interim chemicals 
and the technology to developing nations. 
  He questioned why parties to the Montreal Protocol did not 
begin to use environmentally sound alternatives now instead of 
waiting until 1995 when a review is scheduled of control 
measures applicable to the developing countries with respect to 
HCFCs, HBCFs and Methyl Bromide. 
  Greenpeace's arguments about action to reduce 
ozone-depleting 
substances came at a time when the fifth meeting of parties to 
the Montreal Protocol is being held in Bangkok by the United 
Nations Environment Programme. 
  Kamal Nath, India's minister of the environment and forests 
and president of the fourth meeting of parties to the protocol, 
earlier told a press conference that the protocol was on the way 
to successful implementation, although some countries have yet 
to join and the Copenhagen Amendment, which agreed 
environmentally safe alternatives should replace the interim 
substitutes, has yet to be ratified. 
  Mr. Nath, however, said that even though there was a need to 
phase out CFCs and other ozone-depleting substances, industries 
could not switch overnight and the protocol should not adversely 
affect industrial strategies of developing countries.

  [Text] About 100 million baht has been set aside from the 
5.5-billion-baht Environment Fund for distribution to private 
organisations for environmental protection projects, Science, 
Technology and Environment Deputy Permanent Secretary Athon 
Supphapodok said yesterday. 
  Mr. Athon said the money has not yet been provided to any 
private agency as the ministry has not yet completed drafting 
regulations to control spending. 
  As the 100-million-baht allocation involves both a revolving 
fund and grant aid, Mr. Athon said strict control is needed to 
prevent any loopholes in funding administration. 
  Secretary-general of the Environmental Policy and Planning 
Office Santhat Somchiwit said private projects aimed at solving 
serious environmental problems such as forest deterioration and 
water pollution will be given priority. 
  Mr. Santhat said private firms can apply for loans for the 
construction of waste water or industrial waste treatment 
systems. Nonprofit nongovernmental organisations can request 
grants. 
  He said about 90 percent of the 100 million-baht fund will 
go 
to NGOs involved in environmental protection and conservation. 
Each group is expected to receive about five million baht. 
  Special consideration and promotion will be given to 
action-oriented projects whose implementation is practical and 
has bright achievement prospects, said Mr. Santhat. 
  Thirty-three NGOs are registered as agencies working on 
protecting the environment in Thailand. 
  Mr. Santhat said he wants NGOs to help ``narrow the gap'' 
between the state and the people over certain development 
projects facing opposition from local people. Information about 
those projects will be passed on to the NGOs for further 
dissemination to the local people. 
  Although 100 million baht was considered minimal, Mr. 
Santhat 
said the amount could be adjusted in the future. 
  The Environment Fund was established under the 1992 National 
Environmental Quality Preservation and Promotion Act, with 
contributions of 5.5 billion baht. Seventy percent of the fund 
was government allocation. The remaining 30 percent came from 
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
  Parts of the fund have already been provided for the 
drafting 
of provincial-level environmental protection master plans with 
special focuses on installing waste water treatment systems and 
tackling pollution, Mr. Santhat said.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan yesterday 
called for the establishment of more ozone observation stations 
in developing countries. 
  Mr. Amnuai, addressing the opening of the Third Meeting of 
the Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention for the 
Protection of the Ozone Layer at the United Nations Conference 
Centre, said most of the objectives set out when the convention 
was first agreed upon had been achieved. 
  ``New threats to the ozone layer are possible,'' he said, 
pointing to a pressing need for continuing research on ozone 
layer depletion. 
  He drew attention to the work of the World Meteorological 
Organisation in investigating UV-B radiation and its 
environmental effects. 
  UV-B radiation, which has some positive influences on the 
body, can also cause sunburn, snow blindness, cataracts, ageing 
of the skin and skin cancer. It can suppress immunity against 
tumours initiated in the skin, and can affect plant growth and 
plankton formation adversely.

  [Text] Three laws intended to govern the use and disposal 
of hazardous waste have been rendered ineffective because the 
list of restricted chemicals has yet to be completed, the House 
standing committee on the environment learned yesterday. 
  Experts who testified before the committee said that, while 
the list was more than six months overdue, the problem was 
becoming more urgent as increasing numbers of people were 
falling sick from exposure to dangerous chemicals. One expert 
said the list was being delayed because of pressure from 
industry. 
  Committee adviser Dr. Teanchuang Kalayanamit said the 
problem 
of toxic chemicals in Thailand stemmed mainly from the fact that 
the laws which regulate them are ineffective. The relevant laws 
are the Hazardous Substances Act, the Factory Act and the new 
Environment Law. 
  ``All three laws, which are related to the import, use and 
disposal of toxic chemicals, are not workable now. They are 
dependent on the chemical categories list, which is currently 
incomplete. This is why we seem to have such poor enforcement 
of toxic chemical-related law,'' he said. 
  This list is supposed to divide chemicals into different 
categories: some are supposed to be used with care, others 
require strict labelling and some are supposed to be banned 
outright. The main agency responsible for drawing up the list 
is the Pollution Control Department. The Department of 
Industrial Works and the Agriculture Ministry would then 
implement the laws. 
  ``Sections 17 and 92 of the Hazardous Substances Law require 
the list of hazardous chemicals classification, while section 18 
requires the list of occupational diseases,'' Teanchuang 
explained. ``Even though this law stated that these lists had 
to be finished within six months, it's been more than one year 
now since the amended law was enacted.'' 
  Dr. Teanchuang said the Factory Act also has no toxic 
chemical classifications, giving industry a ``golden period'' 
during which it can do anything without paying attention to the 
law. The law is also supposed to control waste treatment while 
in fact there are not enough treatment plants, and hazardous 
waste is usually dumped, he added. 
  ``The Environment Law, which also stated that different 
types 
of waste will be announced, is now nothing. So, all of the laws 
have lost important parts,'' Teanchuang said. ``As we know, the 
lists are late because there are some lobbies from industrial 
owners who pressure government agencies to label favorably the 
chemicals they use.'' 
  Pollution Control Department's Hazardous Wastes and 
Chemicals 
Management Division Director Dr. Prakarn Boonchueydee accepted 
that hazardous chemicals are now uncontrolled. 
  ``We are now asking for experts from other countries to form 
an industrial organizing committee to solve this problem, but it 
may take time,'' he said. 
  Dr. Oraphan Metadilogkul, occupational health doctor from 
Rajvithee Hospital, said she has found that the number, 
frequency, and seriousness of occupational diseases are all on 
the rise. 
  ``We need an effective protection plan,'' she said. 
  Dr. Teanchuang said there are several ways to move towards a 
solution to this problem. The advice of nongovernmental 
organizations should be sought to help categorize the chemicals. 
  Dump sites should be investigated by private-sector 
inspectors without waiting for the government to fund the 
inspections, because the government works too slowly. 
  Factories must pay for the clean-up costs. 
  The categories of hazardous chemicals should be listed soon. 
If Thai experts do not have time to do it, then the list should 
be copied from foreign or UN lists in order to solve the problem 
today.

  [Text] [Excerpts] The single-minded pursuit of rapid 
economic growth has led to severe environmental problems in many 
Asian cities, a United Nations report said yesterday. 
  [passage omitted] ``Ambient air pollution statistics point 
to 
the special risks of living in a large Asian city,'' the 
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) 
study said. 
  [passage omitted] The study found Bangkok hurting in several 
areas. ``Bangkok dust levels in 1989 were estimated to have 
cost 26 million lost work days and 1,400 excess deaths,'' it 
says. 
  ``Also in Bangkok, average lead blood levels are 40 to 45 
micrograms per deciliter, four times the standard in the United 
States,'' it says. ``There is evidence of permanent brain damage 
in children because of lead poisoning.'' 
  Parts of the Chao Phaya River flowing through Bangkok ``are 
completely lacking in dissolved oxygen and can no longer support 
life'' because untreated household and industrial waste is 
dumped into the river, it says.

  [Excerpt] Mr. Sombat Uitrakun, director of the Zone 11 
Environmental Health Center in Surat Thani Province, said that 
analyses of water samples taken from the Tapi River in 1990 
showed that the water in the river was suitable for consumption. 
But the water first had to be treated to kill the bacteria and 
improve the quality of the water as usual. Also, the water could 
be used for piscicultural activities and for water sports. 
  But water samples taken during the period 1991-1993 have 
shown that the quality of the water in the Tapi River has 
declined to dangerous levels. Today, the river is suitable for 
communications only. In some sections, officials found heavy 
metals such as lead and chromium. For example, at the Tha Thong 
dock, the lead level was 0.16 milligrams per liter, and the 
chromium level was 0.34 milligrams per liter. At the municipal 
dock, the lead level was 0.06 milligrams per liter, and the 
chromium level was 0.14 milligrams per liter. Even though these 
metals were not found everywhere along the river and even though 
the amounts found were small, this could pose a danger. If more 
and more such metals are released into the river, the river will 
become polluted, and this will destroy the ecological system. 
  Mr. Sombat said that the reason why the Tapi River is 
becoming more and more polluted is that the people who live 
along the banks of the river throw their garbage into the river, 
farmers are using pesticides, and some industrial factories are 
secretly releasing untreated waste water into the river. Besides 
this, waste materials from auto repair shops and from battery 
plants also drain into the river. Another reason is that there 
has been a lack of urban planning concerning treating waste 
water before it is released. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday expressed 
alarm at worsening pollution and pledged that his Government 
will enforce environmental protection laws more strictly in 
order to halt further damage. 
  The Premier was addressing the Fourth Indo-Pacific Fish 
Conference at the Central Plaza Hotel -- a conference whose main 
focus is the scientific study of fish. But he concentrated on 
the environment and expressed concern both about the polluting 
effects of fish farming and industrial pollution. 
  He expressed sadness at the deterioration of the fresh-water 
lake of Songkhla ``near my home town in the South, which at one 
time was teeming with a great variety of fish and wildlife, and 
was famous for its scenic beauty.'' 
  He said Songkhla lake is dying. ``The lake is being 
destroyed by waste water released from the local community.'' 
  He noted that geographically Thailand is flanked on both 
sides by seas which in the past provided a sheer abundance of 
fish and other marine resources. Numerous rivers and canals 
criss-crossed the Central Plains. 
  He said he remembered reading the journals of foreign 
visitors who about a century ago travelled to Thailand. 
  ``They told of their ships getting stalled after their 
rudders hit big schools of fish while sailing up the Chao Phraya 
River,'' Mr Chuan said. 
  ``In fact, we have a folk-saying dating back about 800 years 
that says, 'In the water we have fish, in the fields we have 
rice,' fish and rice being the staple foods of our people.'' 
  ``Of course, with the rapid depletion of our fish resources, 
and our monoculture of rice being diversified along with 
industrialisation in recent years, such a saying seems rather 
ironic, and nostalgic also for many people with fond memories of 
the good old days.'' 
  ``As we plunged into earnest development of our fishing 
industry, our exploitation of these abundant fruits of the seas 
and rivers has catapulted Thailand to a leading position in the 
international fishing industry. Fish and seafood have now 
become a major export item for the Kingdom.'' 
  ``The total volume of fish and seafood exported this year 
exceeded $2,000 million in value. Thailand's fishing fleet 
roaming the high seas now ranks seventh in the world.'' 
  ``Despite this great feat in the development of our fishing 
industry and its contribution to the national economy, our joy 
is somewhat subdued by our awareness that we have achieved such 
a position at the expense of the rapid depletion of our once 
abundant resources and the degradation of the sea and coastal 
environment.'' 
  Mr. Chuan noted that coastal areas have silted up, due to 
unchecked soil erosion resulting from alarming deforestation and 
the unsystematic operations of commercial shrimp farms. Water 
temperatures have changed and salinity has caused untold damage 
to coral reefs and aquatic life. 
  He said that to stop more damage to the environment, the 
Government has further tightened up the enforcement of 
environmental protection legislation. 
  ``Industrial factories are now required to install necessary 
water treatment systems. Large shrimp farms along the coasts 
and seafood processing plants are to strictly observe the laws 
on environment protection.'' 
  ``And in 1993, the Government has allocated $99.6 million to 
the Fisheries Department to implement its comprehensive projects 
to replenish our resources. This budget will increase to $108.7 
million in fiscal 1994.'' 
  ``In this regard, I would like to commend our scientists who 
have succeeded in breeding many kinds of fish which would be 
extinct under natural conditions. Many organisations and groups 
have also been active in the conservation of marine life.'' 
  ``These noble efforts have yet to compensate for the loss 
through our past careless exploitation of our fish resources. 
Many varieties have already become extinct.'' 
  Mr. Chuan said he was glad to hear that Mekong River giant 
catfish and shark conservation will be discussed at the 
conference, apart from such major topics as taxonomy and the 
biogenetics of fish. 
  ``The discussion of taxonomy, or the classification of fish 
species, may prove ironic if there are simply no fish to 
classify,'' he said.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA, Nov 20 -- The Vietnamese president has 
conferred `friendship' medals on American Prof. Arnold Schecter 
of Syracuse University in New York, the United States, and 
Doctor Miura Hiroshi, vice president of the Vietnam-Japan 
Medical Exchange Centre, for their studies of the consequences 
of the toxic chemicals used by the US Armed Forces in the 
Vietnam war and their humanitarian aid to the Vietnamese people 
to overcome the war aftermaths. Occasion was the 2d 
International Symposium on `Herbisides in War, the Long-Term 
Effects on Man and Nature' held here from 15-19 November by the 
National Committee on the Consequences of Chemical Warfare in 
Vietnam, the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of 
Science Technology and Environment. 
  During the symposium, more than 200 Vietnamese and foreign 
participants discussed problems such as dioxin in human 
organism, soil composition, vegetal organism and its long-term 
effects on the environment. It was reported that US defoliants 
known as Agent Orange had caused long term, dangerous effects on 
the environment and millions of people in Vietnam. Over the 
past years, the country has done much to solve problems caused 
by the US toxic chemicals, providing initial medical care to the 
victims. Reforestation has been promoted nationwide 
particularly in areas destroyed by the US defoliants to restore 
the environment to normal conditions.

  [Excerpt] Sofia, Dec 6 (BTA) -- The Council of Ministers 
today approved a draft law on reducing the harmful impact of 
household and industrial waste on the environment. The law 
provides for identifying the owners of waste and regulating 
their obligations and responsibilities. It bans dumping waste 
at places other than dumping grounds and lays down new rules for 
transboundary waste shipment, including payment of damages 
clauses. 
  The cabinet today gave consent to carry out negotiations in 
Brussels next year on harmonizing regulations on trade in 
textile articles, ferrous metals, small cattle and meat between 
Bulgaria and the European Union. The members of the Bulgarian 
delegation will be named later on. 
  The government named the Bulgarian members in the 
Bulgarian-Romanian Government Commission on Environmental 
Protection. The Bulgarian side will be headed by Deputy 
Environment Minister Khristo Dalchev. (passage deleted)

  [Text] Usti and Labem, North Bohemia, Nov 18 (CTK) -- 
Czech Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy said today 
he was convinced that north Bohemia faced decent and good 
prospects. 
  Dlouhy was giving a lecture on the problems of the north 
Bohemian region, organized by the Konrad Adenauer Foundation for 
leading figures of the region. 
  Dlouhy recalled that over 7.7 billion crowns (about $260 
million) had been allocated from the state budget and the State 
Environment Fund in 1991-93 for improving the environment. This 
contributed to a 36-percent decrease in sulfur-dioxide emissions 
compared with 1987, a 32-percent drop in nitrogen-oxide 
emissions, and a 58-percent decrease in fly ash emissions. 
  Dlouhy said that the heritage from the past could only be 
removed step-by-step, and added that the completion of two 
reactors at the Temelin nuclear power plant in south Bohemia 
would be a positive solution also for north Bohemia. He said 
the goal in north Bohemia is to shut down 1,600-MW units in 
thermal power plants by 1996. Only four of the present eight 
north Bohemian mines are to remain in operation in the year 
2005, according to Dlouhy.

  [Text] Prague, Nov 18 (CTK) -- The ecological policy 
pursued by the Czech Government is pragmatic, not 
fundamentalist, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus writes in an open 
letter addressed to the former Czech Environment Ministers Ivan 
Dejmal and Josef Vavrousek, and their deputies. 
  The environment ministry's scheme for ecological policy is a 
good one, Klaus stresses in the letter, in which he responds to 
a letter sent to him recently by the above mentioned figures. 
  The government's ecological policy is not torn out of the 
context of social transformation, is not implanted in some 
conceptions of `sustainable development', which are far from the 
reality, but it focuses on the protection and improvement of the 
environment to the extent allowed by our means, the letter says. 
  Ecological policy of a country depends on the country's 
possibilities and it is limited by its economy, Klaus insists in 
the letter. Therefore he finds it senseless and misleading to 
compare the Czech Republic's spending on the environment with 
those in the advanced countries. 
  These countries have the smallest problems with the 
environment, as their economies provide them with funds to 
protect it. Inappropriately high demands regarding the funding 
environmental protection could stifle the Czech economy as early 
as the very beginning of its transformation, Klaus stresses.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Stefan Kozlowski, chairman of the </F>
Presidential Ecological Council, by correspondent Ryszard 
Bobecki; place, date not given] 
  [Text] 
  Bobecki: How much does protection of the 
environment cost us in Poland? 
  Kozlowski: We already spend more than 12 trillion 
zlotys [Z] a year for that purpose. Our index of outlays is 
climbing steadily. Not so long ago our expenditure on 
environmental protection represented 0.5 percent of the national 
income, whereas now this has risen to a little above 1 percent. 
It is a new sphere of economic activity, and its development 
rate is quite dynamic. 
  Bobecki: Does the Presidential Ecological Council 
endeavor to secure guarantees for pro-ecological investment 
projects? 
  Kozlowski: The government is reluctant to extend 
its guarantees for ecological investment projects. 
Consequently, we intend to achieve a situation in which the 
National Fund, which is our richest source of funds, would 
extend certain guarantees to those Western companies which 
intend to invest in Poland. We have already lost a number of 
opportunities for securing foreign capital for investment 
projects because of the absence of government guarantees. This 
difficulty should be resolved as soon as possible. 
  Bobecki: Could you share with us your personal 
reflections on certain matters which you have been monitoring 
closely for a number of years now? How do we look compared with 
the rest of the world? 
  Kozlowski: Compared with the rest of the world, we 
are relatively busy in the field of pro-ecological activities. 
Much busier than our immediate neighbors -- except perhaps for 
the former East Germany. But that is because they receive 
colossal sums of money for environmental protection from the 
western part of Germany. Poland is undoubtedly in the forefront 
of our group as regards setting up integrated financing, 
organizational, and information systems, and it could continue 
to play this leading role in the future. There has been 
considerable and noticeable improvement in many areas. The 
construction of a number of effluent treatment systems has 
contributed to improved water purity in many of our rivers, 
while decreased production in certain sectors of our economy 
caused a reduction in atmospheric pollution and a drop in the 
content of sulphur in the atmosphere. 
  However, a new area of environmental risk has emerged in the 
agricultural sector. Fertilizers washed down from our fields 
into ground waters are causing an environmental degradation of 
our lakes. Another great problem is caused by small industrial 
producers who notoriously ignore and bypass the requirements of 
legal regulations devised to protect the environment. Our 
liberal legislation allows virtually anyone to set up an 
industrial enterprise without the need to comply with any terms 
or conditions. In consequence, such enterprises become a 
nuisance and a potential danger not only to their immediate 
neighbors. Small industrial companies situated around Warsaw 
are particularly aggressive. 
  I am very much concerned about certain moves made by the 
State Agency for Agricultural Property. It has been selling -- 
into private hands -- landed properties constituting some of our 
most valuable sites of special scientific interest, since only 
unspoiled natural areas are of interest to buyers nowadays. 
Most recently, the agency has offered a number of... lakes for 
sale! We believe that this should not be tolerated. Lakes 
could at most be rented out, not sold. The practice of selling 
lakes to private buyers contravenes basic principles of regional 
land and economic management and goes against the state's 
obligations to society, not to mention the fact that it also 
constitutes a threat to our most valuable natural resources. 
This underlines the fact that we lack satisfactory control 
mechanisms for regulating privatization schemes in agriculture. 
At the same time, we still lack a properly standardized 
procedure for ecological auditing to be carried out whenever a 
given enterprise undergoes a privatization process. Even the 
most major companies are privatized without an assessment of 
their potential for causing ecological damage. We have not been 
able to work out suitable solutions despite the work of the 
joint commission of the Ministry of Ownership Transformations 
and the environmental protection sector. When it comes to the 
reform process, we are definitely not forceful enough in 
introducing ecological protection mechanisms into privatization 
transformations. 
  Bobecki: What causes this inability to be more 
forceful? 
  Kozlowski: The fact that legislation work on the 
drafting of a new ecology law has been checked. In the 10th 
[old] Sejm we drafted and passed four laws, but another five are 
still awaiting action. The subsequent dissolution of the First 
[new] Sejm did not help to advance our work. This hiatus is 
very dangerous, because we have only reached the halfway mark in 
our work on the transformation of the ecology laws. 
  Bobecki: Which are the most important ecology laws 
that the new Sejm should pass as soon as possible? 
  Kozlowski: A truly dramatic situation obtains in 
our water management sector: We have no relevant legislation on 
water resources and their management, and Poland simply cannot 
function without such a law. We have no legislation concerning 
extraordinary environmental hazards. The chemical, transport, 
and (foreign) nuclear energy industries pose a whole range of 
dramatically increasing ecological risks. We have no adequate 
laws, organizational structures, or procedures to resort to in 
cases of specific extraordinary hazards endangering the 
environment. We have no law on industrial waste materials. 
Poland is at present virtually deluged with industrial waste. 
We struggle with this problem in every single parish and every 
single city in the country. These questions must be resolved as 
soon as possible, because speed is absolutely essential here. 
The fact that successive parliaments have been unable even to 
initiate a debate on these issues is highly alarming, to say the 
least. Another example, this time somewhat bizarre, concerns 
the situation in the sphere of game shooting and hunting laws. 
Two successive parliaments have failed to sort out things in 
this complicated area, and such issues as questions of property 
and ownership relating to game shooting and hunting and the 
principles of managing game stocks in Poland are still 
unresolved. 
  Bobecki: Is our present legislation relating to 
ecology really as defective as that? 
  Kozlowski: It is. All legal acts concerning the 
sphere of ecology were originally devised to fit the 
requirements of a totalitarian state. Now we must adapt all 
legislation concerning the sphere of ecology to the needs of a 
free market economy. 
  Bobecki: Thank you for talking to us.

<F P=106> [Article by Elena Siposova: ``The Invisible Killer''] </F>
  [Text] After World War II, in a surge of enthusiasm over 
the expanding dimensions of our economic growth, we forgot that 
just then we began violating the laws of nature. Rebuilding a 
war-devastated republic, again in common with the Czechs, we 
started out without consideration for what was until then 
virginal Slovak nature. Electrification, industrialization, and 
the building up of heavy industries imposed a cruel tax on the 
children and especially on the grandchildren of the 
Stakhanovites of those days. 
  You may say: Why talk about it now? Isn't that what everyone 
knows? We plundered raw material resources, polluted the 
environment, the land, and the water, and continue introducing 
into our environment a multitude of foreign substances that we 
have even found so natural that we systematically and to an ever 
increasing extent inject them into our food chain. 
  Our ill-considered impact on the landscape according to the 
gigantesque model of new construction helped create the sad 
appearance of our hills, woodlands, groves, oak and conifer 
forests, pasturelands, and meadows. At first the leaves began to 
fall, then the needles dried up and, ultimately, entire trees. 
Grass turned yellow, meadowland forest became an almost archaic 
term, trout and crayfish had long gone from brooks and larger 
streams, the frog ceased to sit at the springhead. Finding a 
lizard, not necessarily the rare red one, ought to be rewarded 
today by the top Nike prize. With a ``hind left,'' we have 
deformed the structure of the original Slovak landscape.... 
  Indeed, that's what everyone knows. And they also know that 
bathing in the Hron, the Ipel, the Vah, or, God forbid, the 
Danube, means risking at least an allergic rash. What is 
frightening, however, is that few people are concerned. Long ago 
we found that something must be done about it, but we have been 
putting off the solution. This on the part of the government 
that says that ``right now we have no money for it, it will have 
to wait,'' as well as on the part of all of us because we all 
are in a large or small degree responsible for the devastation 
of our environment. 
  For decades, the totalitarian government successfully 
covered 
up the truth. But even in the subsequent four years, we have not 
advanced much in redressing the problem. Somehow it seems 
inappropriate in decent society to talk about a dangerous 
invisible killer. 
  Are we doing it out of indifference or out of ignorance? A 
system in which truth about the environment of this or that 
region is suppressed may be something we have become accustomed 
to, but adding to it is also another deficiency, which is the 
ignorance of representatives of the regional state 
administration in regard to environmental issues. We will 
attempt a gradual search for the causes of this state of 
affairs. And it is an alarming one. 
  The median life expectancy for men in our country is 66.6 
years. That is six to seven years less than in the advanced 
countries. Women live longer--75.4 years, on average--which, 
however, is five to seven years less than in Western Europe. 
Mortality rose by 2.5 per thousand in the 1960-80 period. We may 
say that is not bad, it virtually stagnates. But, when we 
realize that up to one-fifth of the deceased do not reach age 60 
because deaths due to tumors and diseases of the circulatory 
system have increased and the number of cancer cases have nearly 
doubled over 1965, we must recognize that the situation is 
alarming. Not until 1988 did we learn the facts from certain 
okreses relating to high infant and perinatal mortality. Until 
that time, we were handing out false numbers because the quality 
of medical care was judged by the percentage of deaths. But the 
cause was (and still is) a rising number of children born with 
development defects, risky pregnancies due to a deteriorating 
environment, and problems rooted in social pathology that have 
continued to grow in the past four years. 
  Furthermore, environmental deterioration impacts adversely 
on 
the health of the population, contributing to allergies and 
oncological and cardiovascular diseases, cases of which in the 
advanced countries are already declining in number. Particularly 
dangerous are such negative factors as noise, vibrations, 
radiation, exposure to heat, thermal pollution, radon threat, 
and, above all, harmful substances in food. Nor can we shut our 
eyes to inadequate health care, which has been deteriorating 
from year to year due to reduced subsidies. 
  Up to 55 percent of the SR [Slovak Republic] population 
lives 
in environmentally impaired areas, of whom 41 percent in a 
strongly, up to extremely, impaired environment. The following 
regions, in particular, are unhealthy and endangered: 
Bratislava, Trnava-Galanta, the upper Nitra, central Hron, 
Kosice, central Zemplin, central Spis, the upper Vah, and 
central Gemery. The negative impact on people living in these 
regions has shown up in up to 30 percent of children having a 
weakened immune system, and the illness rates and youth 
invalidity statistics are a warning. 
  Certain plant species have disappeared, and several species 
of trees are endangered. Extinct are 41 percent of the species 
of lichens, which are often viewed as indicatory of the quality 
of the environment. Of 751 species of wildlife, those that have 
disappeared or are endangered include 27 species of fish, 20 
species of amphibians, 19 species of reptiles, 79 species of 
birds, and 30 species of mammals. Man, too, is a mammal. How 
long will he hold out? 
  It is said that money is not everything, but, in matters of 
the environment, this does not apply. Even though no amount of 
money can restore our devastated nature from one day to the 
next, we could nevertheless be helped by money in at least 
conserving the present state of the environment and slowly 
improving it by eliminating waste flows, replanting, 
recultivating the land, and purifying the water. In our country, 
however, environment is viewed like an athlete running in last 
place, on whom it no longer pays to place a bet. It is said that 
this kind of attitude toward resolving one of our gravest 
problems is displayed by people deciding on the allocation of 
moneys from the state budget to this area. We do not realize 
that it is precisely from there that everything begins. 
  The problem was discussed at an informal meeting between 
officials representing the SR Environment Ministry and some 
journalists. They confirmed that investments needed to 
revitalize our environment are not available. The high level of 
programs prepared by the ministry's staff was confirmed also by 
EC experts from Belgium, with whom I had the opportunity to 
discuss our projects. But carrying them out truly depends on 
money. It is needed to clean up the land and water, restore the 
damaged forests, and revive the wildlife. 
  Our economy is characterized by a high consumption of energy 
and raw materials. We need quantities of coal for power 
generation, fuel rods for nuclear power plants, iron ore and 
concentrates, quantities of dressed ores, and other raw 
materials. This industry orientation, alas, is at present the 
only one assuring the regions a modicum of employment. But it 
consumes more than half of the energy the generation of which is 
largely responsible for polluting our environment. After the 
metallurgical industry, its second-largest consumer is the 
chemical industry, followed by the cement and building-materials 
industries. For instance, the ironworks in Kosice and the 
aluminum plant in Ziar nad Hronom and Slovnaft among them 
consume nearly 22 percent of all power produced. It would seem 
that there is no way out of the vicious circle.... 
  If we stop producing the way we have thus far (and for now 
we 
lack finances for higher-quality production), additional tens of 
thousands of people will lose their jobs. But, if we continue, 
the population will pay for it year after year by its health. 
According to a European survey (EMEP) in 1992, the SR was in the 
part of Europe having the highest regional air pollution and 
rainwater acidity readings. In the overall quantity of harmful 
emissions into the air, the power industry, including heating, 
was responsible for 64 percent, transport for 19.5 percent, and 
the metallurgical and chemical industries for 7 percent each. 
  EC representatives David W. Rodda and Tue Rohrsted last week 
in an interview with SMENA stated that the European Communities 
will see to improving the environmental situation in the 
countries of the former Eastern bloc. The promised financial 
assistance is very attractive because it involves a loan at 
minimum interest. But it covers only selected localities 
adjoining international regions, which in our case means the 
Danube Basin. But our high-mountain forests are drying, and we 
can hardly expect to find good uncles from abroad willing to 
finance conservation of the present state of affairs, much less 
its improvement. 
  The total volume of available water stock in Slovakia 
averages out to 2,860 cubic meters of water per inhabitant; the 
European average is 5,000 cubic meters--this while the specific 
consumption of potable water per person per day in our country 
is twice that of Austria. Up to 16 okreses are reporting an 
appreciable deficit in potable water supply.... 
  Why do we need double the amount of potable water the 
Austrians need? For a long time already, advanced countries have 
been making a use distinction between potable and utility water 
consumption. But we think nothing of using potable water even 
for washing cars, and some people love to do that even in 
protected areas. And if one happens to come upon a mineral 
spring and no one is around, owners of those wheeled homes 
rarely hesitate.... An Austrian would not do such a thing, and 
thereby evidently shows his patriotism. 
  There is a great shortage of sewage treatment plants, even 
though more are under construction. We need many more of them, 
also because surface waters especially are greatly polluted. And 
again we run up against an insoluble circle. We have barely 60 
percent of the required quantity of potable water, but we are 
wasting it mindlessly and using it for all purposes because we 
do not have nonpotable, utility water that ought to be used in 
industry. 
  Every year we produce 34 million tons of waste, of which 3.3 
million are hazardous and 1.6 million communal waste. Records 
show that we have 7,204 dumps, of which 335 have permits. A 
certain portion of the waste is incinerated. Of the 70 
incinerators, only two are large (over 100,000 tons annually). 
Of 34 small incinerators for industrial waste, up to 11 lack 
scrubbers for removing exhalates. Hospital waste, too, is burned 
in inadequate incinerators. A special problem is safeguarding 
suitable storage of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. 
But, in the field of waste management, we are confronted with 
yet another scare. Some canny businessmen take advantage of 
foreign offers and, for a relatively attractive financial 
reward, import tons of waste, especially plastics from the FRG, 
the burning of which releases the kind of exhalates for which 
the German entrepreneur would have to pay millions at home. Our 
entrepreneurs are taking advantage of legal loopholes and 
discard the imported waste in our dumps or even outside of them, 
sometimes with the blessing of local officials, perhaps for a 
bribe or because the responsible officials are not bound by any 
law because current legislation speaks only of a ban on the 
importation of hazardous materials. Customs offices do not have 
experts or laboratories to establish whether the imported waste 
constitutes a hazard. Regional officials, too, have no way of 
verifying the imported materials. Workers at the incinerators 
very often accept them willingly because they feel the marks 
slipping right into their pockets. 
  In this way, we face the prospect of becoming, within a few 
years, the waste dump of Europe. Those who now operate within 
this lethal circle are totally unconcerned that they are robbing 
their children of years of life and preparing an early death for 
them as well as for themselves. There is no shortage of foreign 
offers in this business, just as there are not a few 
entrepreneurs in our country who want to make big money without 
working for it. The question is what the customs authorities are 
doing, why they are not concerned about the many trucks and 
carloads of waste heading for Slovakia from abroad. Is it that 
here, too, an important role is played by foreign currency going 
straight into the pocket? What are the staffs of ecology 
departments at district and community offices doing? Why don't 
they report such doings in their regions to the higher 
authorities? 
  Our readers, too, surely have observed cases of 
environmental 
devastation. Perhaps they are bothered by the lax attitude on 
the part of responsible officials and by the inconsiderateness 
of many among us. We will be glad to publish examples from the 
regions.

  [Text] Bratislava, Nov 15 (CTK) -- The Austrian and Slovak 
environment ministers, Maria Rauch-Kallat and Jozef Zlocha, 
signed a memorandum on understanding and cooperation in 
environmental protection today. 
  At a press conference held later by both ministers, Zlocha 
explained that the memorandum legalized and extended the 
existing cooperation. Rauch-Kallat pointed to joint projects 
already underway, such as air and water quality protection, 
protection of the Morava river region which forms the border 
between the two countries, and a study of the effective use of 
energy sources. 
  As well as increasing the exchange of data, the memorandum 
is 
also intended to promote cooperation in establishing the legal 
norms and economic tools to be used in the monitoring and 
protection of the environment. 
  Rauch-Kallat said that Austria would provide 105 million 
Austrian schillings in support of Slovakia's environment 
protection efforts. The sum was destined for a waste water 
treatment project for the river Morava and the monitoring of 
emissions from the Duslo Sala chemical factory among other 
things, she said. 
  On the question of the waste dump in Berg which could 
pollute 
Bratislava's drinking water, Rauch-Kallat reported that the 
project had not yet been approved by parliament. If it did have 
a negative influence on the local environment, she would oppose 
it, she told journalists. 
  Rauch-Kallat said Austria was interested in supporting 
Slovakia's withdrawal from nuclear power production. There is 
one nuclear power plant in operation in Slovakia, at Jaslovske 
Bohunice, and a second under construction at Mochovce, western 
Slovakia. She said there was an agreement on the exchange of 
information from the Slovak nuclear industry.

  [Text] Experts from 22 countries of our continent, who are 
participating in the meeting called for by the Economic 
Commission for Latin America (ECLA) and the United Nations 
Environment Program (UNEP), approved in Santiago on 18 November 
a recommendation that their governments implement a regional 
agreement banning the importation of all types of wastes that 
could be dangerous for the region. 
  They also called on the member parties of the Brasilea 
Agreement [not further identified] to totally ban this trade 
from industrialized countries to developing nations. ``The 
dispatch of waste from First World countries for processing or 
recycling has been transformed into a mechanism that in practice 
camouflages the uncontrolled and indiscriminate transfer of 
dangerous waste,'' the experts stressed. 
  The participants agreed in indicating that Latin American 
and 
Caribbean countries do not have the capability to process their 
own toxic wastes, thus making it very difficult for them to take 
charge of toxic waste from other areas.

  [Text] The National Legal Amazon Council met for the first 
time in Planalto Palace today. The council members discussed the 
prospects of sustainable development in the region. President 
Itamar Franco opened the council's meeting. 
  All the ministers and governors of the Amazon region are 
members of the council that was created in September. The 
council is an advisory organization of the president and its 
activities are linked to the Environment and Legal Amazon Region 
Ministry, which is in charge of all actions by the federal 
government in the Amazon region. The council is responsible for 
drawing up an integrated policy for the Amazon region and for 
articulating joint measures with the states and municipalities 
for sustainable development, for improving the standard of 
living of the Amazon population, for the protection of the 
environment, and for the preservation of Indian culture. 
  In his speech, President Itamar Franco said the Brazilian 
people will not yield their sovereignty over the Amazon and that 
it is in the interest of all to resolve the problems once and 
for all in a balanced manner: 
  [Begin recording] Responsibility regarding the 
Amazon region means seeking a policy for sustainable 
development, and for the improvement of the standard of living 
of its more than 17 million people. This responsibility demands 
a clear commitment to the protection of the environment and the 
rational use of the natural resources. [end recording] 
  President Franco also said it is necessary to update the 
debates on the Amazon, which is the last frontier of the human 
race and knowledge. He recalled that an integrated policy for 
the region is being defined by the ministry, which is in charge 
of coordinating federal action in the Amazon, and by the 
National Council: 
  [Begin recording] The defense of the territory, 
the presence of the Brazilian state in the unpopulated regions 
or in the distant regions with little population, the protection 
of the people of the forests starting with the Indians, the 
fight against the illegal means of depredation of natural 
resources, all of these things have been the constant concern of 
the government in drawing up its plans. [end 
recording] 
  President Franco also said the backbone of all the actions 
in 
the Amazon is the division of the region into environmental and 
economic areas. Franco added that this is the basis of knowledge 
for the rational and sustainable exploitation of the natural 
resources, and for defining the areas of preservation and 
occupation. 
  The National Legal Amazon Council created eight sectorial 
commissions. The Amazon represents 57 percent of the national 
territory and is the planet's greatest natural resource. 
Therefore, in order to take care of this region the government 
is creating ways to prevent abuse in the region. The council, 
which met for the first time today in Planalto Palace, decided 
to create eight sectorial commissions to resolve the region's 
problems in the areas of sustainable development, international 
relations, vigilance and protection of the territory, mineral 
prospecting, Indian population, forestry, science and 
technology, and also education, health and social affairs. 
  Environment Minister Rubens Cicupero gave as an example the 
area of gold prospectors who have no clear legislation for their 
work involving 400,000 workers. Ricupero said the current 
legislation is not applicable and this why all gold prospectors 
in the country are considered illegal.

  [Text] The tree was the ancient home of mankind, the 
continuity of life depended on it, that was its first function 
and a million years later it has not changed in the slightest; 
the map has changed, the map of forests is not nearly the same. 
  It must have been a green planet and it no longer is; the 
five continents have giant areas of desert that are constantly 
growing; then not only forests are in danger, life is, too. 
  As an example, and at the same time a question: when will 
the 
forest where we used to play as children disappear? We did not 
even notice when the forest disappeared, and now we have to 
travel farther to hear the ``cries'' of the forest. 
  And so, as no one notices, 350,000 hectares of forest 
disappear in Ecuador each year, according to the ecological 
foundations. Esmeraldas is one of the provinces most affected. 
At first glance, it is not noticeable. Traveling along the 
Santiago and the Cayapas Rivers, everything seems perfect and 
Esmeraldas richly deserves its title of green province. 
  The foundations' position is credible. They have identified 
the problem, and if it were not for them, the situation of the 
forests would be worse. Nevertheless, officials at the Ministry 
of Agriculture believe that they exaggerate when they say that 
350,000 hectares are deforested each year. The Institute of 
Agriculture-Livestock Strategies says that the figure is 
200,000, but the Institute for Reforestation (Inefan) says it is 
barely 171,000. 
  What is happening in Esmeraldas is incomprehensible. There 
are trees wherever you look. Still, there are hundreds and 
thousands of pieces of timber all along the sides of the roads 
waiting to be loaded. 
  Many would not believe what is happening, what deforestation 
are they talking about, they would ask, if pachacos and 
terminalias--trees from the Amazon region planted in the 
tropics--are populating Esmeraldas in their thousands. 
  Someone who is profiting from all this said that nothing is 
happening here. As you can see we have planted 400 hectares 
of...800 hectares of..., and as if giving the lie to this truth, 
from the distance came the noise of a power saw, louder than the 
trilling of the birds at six in the evening, more powerful than 
the wind.... 
  There are an estimated 10-12,000 power saws like this in the 
country, cutting off life in the midst of the forest to supply 
the needs of an ever larger and more demanding society. 
  Borbon is ``the capital of the lumber market.'' That is no 
exaggeration. The banks of the river are covered with trees. 
Then the description we once gave it in these pages was, in 
fact, accurate: ``Borbon, the Potosi [silver producing center in 
Bolivia, legendary for the wealth it produced] of timber.'' 
  The last chanules, cedars, and laurel trees arrive by river 
from the heart of the forest. Man's intervention is plundering 
the green patrimony. This is happening in Pedro Vicente 
Maldonado, in Quininde, in San Lorenzo, but in Playa de Oro it 
is worse, they say that only the stubble of the forest remains 
there. During the trip we took with the Inefan officials, the 
magnitude of the deforestation problem was not evident. The 
settlers said that we would have to travel four hours upriver to 
see that. But in Borbon we can get an idea of what is happening. 
  There are giant cranes that take the timber from the river 
and place it on trucks that then take it to Quito, Guayaquil, 
and Cuenca, or by sea to some Colombian port where it can be 
sold more profitably. 
  These days, a tree in the forest is worth 60,000 sucres, but 
in Quito, the same tree is worth 100,000 sucres, including the 
cost of transportation, and it is worth twice that in Colombia. 
  Borbon lives from lumber, without it ``everyone would 
leave.'' There is no denying this; the exploitation of the 
forest provides the livelihood for hundreds of families in the 
area. It is a respectable activity as long as the exploitation 
of the forests is carried out in a responsible way according to 
the principles of conservation. Otherwise the losers over the 
long term will be those who are benefiting today. 
  It is not a matter of being a pure environmentalist who 
wants 
to maintain the forest patrimony intact, as National Forestry 
Director Luis Valverde said. The forest is obviously there to be 
used, but for each tree cut down, 10 or more should be planted. 
  The conflict between timber men and lands is taking place in 
the upper Cayapas and in Onzole, according to a representative 
of the Cayapa community in Santa Maria. A whole arsenal of 
implements--picks, machetes, manual chippers, power saws, 
tractors--is creating great environmental gaps. ``The trilling 
of the birds has given way to that of the power saws, and there 
is no one to stop it.'' 
  Seeing the timber, like gigantic rafts, move slowly along 
the 
rivers in search of a buyer, it becomes clear that someone is 
responsible for the destruction to the forests: the four 
companies operating there--Plywood, Endesa, Foresa, and Codesa. 
The companies claim that they are managing their operations so 
as not to deplete the forests and say that the worst despoilers 
are the settlers. The settlers say that the four companies 
exploit 80 percent of the forest, and they exploit only 20 
percent, while the natives blame the timber companies and the 
settlers...no one is to be believed. 
  This is not an attempt to make the timber companies or the 
settlers seem more responsible for one of the worst chapters in 
Ecuadoran ecology. The problem is that the forests were never 
renewed, the protection and reforestation laws never observed, 
and successive governments watched passively while bit by bit 
the green vanished. 
  Trees are a renewable resource and reforestation programs 
should have been started years ago. These programs would serve 
today as contributors of forest reserves to maintain the timber 
industry, without having to issue increasingly frequent calls 
for environmental help. 
  It was thought that the forests would last forever. This was 
not the case, and the dreams of those who thought that one day 
timber could be the main support for the economy are further 
from realization. 
  Large and small companies complain about waves of settlers 
who, from time to time, arrive with their implements in search 
of land. When they do not find a place close to a community, 
they cut down a section of forest and plant coffee, banana, and 
cacao. 
  Inhabitants of these areas say that there are no longer any 
great expanses of forest, ``there are only small portions on 
farms.'' 
  The problem of the Esmeraldas forest goes back to 1965, when 
the state, through the forestry program, granted concessions to 
the industries that built bridges, opened roads, and brought in 
transport to carry out their work. Access whetted the appetites 
and the needs of the people, and the forest was parceled out. 
  Valverde said that aggressive colonization took place during 
the government of Jaime Roldos and deforestation was total. ``We 
realized then that there was nothing to be done to stop 
colonization. Colonization is overwhelming.'' 
  After so many speeches and forestry programs, the only truth 
is that trees are the livelihood of today, and they will be 
tomorrow if we protect them now. 
<H5>  The Country Loses </H5>
  There are many ways of understanding development, but for 
the 
Cayapas of Esmeraldas Province, when natural resources are 
destroyed, there is no basis for the creation of sustained and 
lasting prosperity. 
  Because of that belief, they demand greater responsibility 
from the timber companies and the settlers in exploiting native 
forests. There are four companies in Esmeraldas, the oldest of 
which is Plywood, which has been operating in the Quininde for 
28 years. 
  There is no doubt that the companies have been growing at 
the 
expense of the natural forest that stretches from the valley of 
Guayllabamba to Cande. In exchange, the four companies have 
reforested 4,000 hectares with pachaco, laurel, mascaray, 
terminalias, and jacaranda. 
  Exactly how many hectares have been deforested is unknown. 
The kindest estimates speak of 200,000 in 30 years and assume 
that there remain 1.504 million hectares to be deforested. 
  The problem is very complicated, as there are very few firms 
that recognize their responsibility to reforest. The others say: 
``How am I going to reforest. If they occupy my land, the forest 
is no longer mine.'' After so many unanswered questions, it 
turns out that one of the elements of the problem we are 
discussing is land ownership. 
  How much time is left for what remains of the forest? 
Perhaps 
very little, if the companies do not begin to implement a 
forestry plan. Only Plywood has carried out reforestation in the 
area. Marco Gandara, the company's administrator in Quininde, 
says that forest management is being practiced. 
  Together with deforestation, another problem is the 
cultivation of the African palm. Wherever one goes, the roads 
are private and the palm groves are so vast that one can go for 
hours without finding the exit. 
  The palm growers purchase the land from the settlers. The 
palm is a tree that requires nutrients, especially nitrogen. The 
growing of African palm is prohibited in all countries, except 
Ecuador, where it is grown even knowing that afterward these 
lands will be a desert. 
<H5>  The Forest, Subject of Discord </H5>
  Now that the problem has been identified and it has been 
determined that 60 percent of deforested land can be utilized 
for raising livestock, Inefan officials have launched a Program 
To Encourage Forest Replanting (Planfor). 
  Planfor contemplates the reforestation of 600,000 hectares 
in 
20 years, the creation of 50,000 new jobs as a direct result of 
Planfor, and about 250,000 jobs as an indirect result. 
  This entails getting the peasants to ``fall in love'' with 
planting trees, said Luis Valverde, national forestry director, 
so that money from the forest returns to the forest.... 
  During the trip to Esmeraldas with officials of the Ministry 
of Agriculture, Minister Mario Gonzalez spoke of the need to 
preserve the province as a forestry zone. 
  Ecological tourism is an enormous field. Galapagos is the 
prime example, and Esmeraldas has just as much beauty to offer. 
  This statement runs counter to the differences among 
Chachis, 
and between blacks and Chachis. At this very moment there is a 
dispute in progress because a group of communities wants to 
lease more than 20,000 hectares to a timber company for 
exploitation. 
  There is opposition among members of the community. The 
blacks threaten that on the day the forest is leased, there will 
be total war. It is foretold (is this an alert?). 
  Eliseo Medina, president of the Zonal Organization of Upper 
Cayapa, is in favor of an agreement to divide the land between 
the Chachis and the blacks. ``We want the land to be shared, we 
are two ethnic peoples, we should get along, but we will not 
allow the forest to be fragmented.'' 
  Luis Pinchiche, representative of the Chachis, charged that 
the timber company will pay 16,500 sucres for a tree, when the 
real cost is 160,000. This is how the subject of the forests in 
Esmeraldas is discussed these days, between interlocutors 
without a sensible dialogue or clear objectives.

  [Text] In another 20 years, the Ecuadoran timber industry 
will no longer have any raw material and Ecuador, a country 
traditionally self-sufficient in wood, will begin importing it. 
  This is one of the conclusions of a study on strategies for 
a 
sustained timber industry in Ecuador, conducted by the Ecuadoran 
Institute of Forestry, Nature Areas and Wild Life (Inefan), with 
support from the International Organization of Tropical Woods 
(OIMT). 
  Eduardo Mansur, a technician in forest economy and one of 
the 
authors of the study, gave a lecture on the subject to members 
of the Ecuadoran Association of the Wood Industry. 
  Mansur said that Ecuador has a greater area of natural scrub 
growth in previously deforested areas than of replanted forest. 
Planted forests in the country account for no more than 80,000 
hectares, while scrub growth is more than 95,000 hectares. 
  The study identified the production potential of Ecuadoran 
forests and the need to protect them. 
  A diagnosis of the local industry was also performed and the 
level of development of the country's timber industry 
established. 
  Ecuador has great potential for wood production, but 
exploitation is not rational. While there is extraction of 
forest resources, there is no true management of the natural 
forest, said Mansur. 
  Given this situation, Inefan launched Planfor (Plan To 
Encourage Forest Replanting) that intends to change this 
situation radically and to reforest an area of 600,000 hectares 
in the next 20 years. 
  In this way, the forestry industry would be placed on a 
self-sustaining basis, reversing the disappearance of forestry 
resources that is taking place in the countries of the world's 
tropical belt due to the extraction of timber, replacement of 
the forest for agricultural use, grazing, and human resettlement. 
  The plan maintains that the development level of the 
country's forest industry can be improved through training for 
25,000 persons employed in the industry, the availability of 
credit for the improvement of small industry, the creation of 
poles of industry for cooperative marketing, and control over 
the use of power saws. 
  Mansur emphasized that Ecuador's forest resources, located 
primarily in Amazonia, need conservation and protection, as do 
the scarce forest resources on the coast, which are threatened. 
  The danger is especially evident in northern Esmeraldas, 
where exploitation is twice what it should be, about 1.7 million 
cubic meters per year, when it should be no more than .9 million 
cubic meters, to maintain the forest in a permanent condition of 
production. 
  In conclusion, the study presents three scenarios. The first 
is titled ``Pessimist,'' in which the Planfor does not work, 
there are no forest replantings, and by the year 2013 Ecuador's 
forest resources are depleted so that no further exploitation is 
possible. 
  The second scenario is titled ``Conservative'' and assumes 
that Planfor is only carried out by one-third. In that case, the 
existence of replanted forests is guaranteed to the year 2013, 
with some surplus for export. 
  In the third scenario, titled ``Desirable,'' two-thirds of 
the replanting called for by Planfor is accomplished, some 
400,000 hectares in 20 years, which will permit the construction 
of a paper pulp and paper factory, important investments in the 
forest industry, and significant exports that would exceed a 
billion dollars annually in 20 years. 
  Which of these scenarios comes true depends on the entire 
Ecuadoran society, on the forest industry, the government, the 
peasants, and rural proprietors, who will be able to share in 
the country's forestry development, Mansur said. 
  He pointed out that wood is indispensable to mankind and, as 
it is a renewable resource, we can produce it, plant it, and 
harvest it, but this requires time, planning, and resources.

<F P=106> [Article by Leonardo Coca Palacios] </F>
  [Text] Rivas -- The campesinos are using forest resources 
indiscriminately: some for their own consumption and others to 
sell. However, ``the problem has grown worse since the 
government's distribution of land to people demobilized from the 
Resistance and the Army,'' said the departmental representative 
of IRENA [Institute of Natural Resources], Maurice Gutierrez 
Pascuas. 
  The regions most hurt by this logging are Sapoa, Cardenas, 
Ostional, Escalante, San Juan del Sur, and La Chocolata. In 
these places 300,000 trees will be planted to halt 
desertification. 
  ``The turnover of lands to demobilized combatants has 
worsened the problem, as there is no control over them, and they 
are often highly unstable persons who will resort to violence,'' 
said the IRENA representative. 
  Environmental protection campaigns must make the campesinos 
and people in general more aware. ``We are not refusing to let 
them use the wood, but the forests must become a perpetual and 
sustainable resource,'' continued Gutierrez. 
<H5>  No Institutional Communication </H5>
  Ometepe Island is one of the national parks that has been 
declared a nature reserve. ``In this reserve there is a lot of 
poaching of animal species,'' and we are unable to cover the 
entire territory. 
  ``We appealed to the Army, and that is how we were able to 
seize thousands of turtle and bird eggs. In the La Flor Reserve 
we are working with the police and we have managed to wipe out 
contraband.'' 
  The IRENA representative criticized the lack of 
communication 
between independent government agencies. The department's 
environmental problems worsened when the National Institute for 
Agrarian Reform--at the order of the central 
government--distributed lands to demobilized combatants without 
consulting them. 
  ``Former members of the Resistance and of the EPS [Sandinist 
People's Army] cut down trees in order to plant and to sell 
wood.'' For future actions, ``there should be better internal 
communication,'' Gutierrez said vehemently. 
  He praised the efforts of student environmentalists, for 
with 
their help we have achieved many goals. ``The secondary school 
Ecological Brigades have done a great deal of work,'' and soon 
we will plant 20,000 trees in Ometepe Island. 
  Finally, he appealed to the entire community to avert the 
desertification of Rivas. ``The people must realize that we have 
to protect the environment in order to avoid what happened in 
Occidente, which had relied on the cultivation of cotton as a 
single crop: desertification.''

<F P=106> [Commentary by Nicaraguan Environmental Movement Executive </F>
Director Pedro Gamboa] 
  [Text] The increasing environmental deterioration of 
Nicaragua's natural resources and the severe water and soil 
pollution caused by the irrational use of pesticides and 
indiscriminate discharge of toxic chemical and industrial wastes 
make it essential to control and regulate the nation's economic 
activities. 
  Various publications and reports--even government 
reports--presented by reputable persons with well-known 
environmental credentials have provided us with information that 
is truly alarming regarding the nation's future development. 
  One example is the deforestation rate--150,000 hectares a 
year--in areas used for agriculture. Deforestation is creating a 
crisis, and in 15 years we will have no woods, as Nicaragua's 
present forested area is approximately 3.5 million hectares. 
  Water is another critical case. Here the crisis has two 
aspects: 
  a) The small quantity of resources left. 
  b) The quality of the resources we are using. 
<H5>  Institutional Regulation </H5>
  In the first case, we have learned recently that over 40 
rivers in the central Pacific region have dried up. Secondly, a 
large part of our rivers, lakes, and ponds are badly polluted. 
In Managua, we are now dependent for water for human consumption 
on Asososca Lake and underground wells. 
  This situation demands the improvement of institutional 
management, the rationalization of our use of natural resources, 
and the people's organized and conscious involvement in 
protecting our natural resources and preserving the quality of 
the environment. 
  These factors are the qualitative aspects which the MAN 
[Nicaraguan Environmental Movement] is proposing for Nicaraguan 
society in the General Environmental Bill. 
  This bill's most important features are: 
  1. Assigning environmental management duties and functions 
to 
each government agency in a coherent and orderly manner. 
  2. Allowing the people to exercise control of the natural 
resources of their area, through the use of administrative, 
civil, or criminal actions against those who violate the law. 
  3. Requiring an environmental impact study before any 
economic project is undertaken. 
<H5>  Toxic Wastes Prohibited </H5>
  4. Giving producers, through fiscal, tax, and credit 
policies, incentives for investments or other efforts that will 
lead to the restoration and preservation of their area or 
territory. 
  5. Requiring students to perform 100 hours of environmental 
work in their area, as a graduation requirement. 
  6. Barring imports of toxic wastes and chemical products 
prohibited in their country of origin; the discharge or storage 
of trash in parks or public areas; spraying pesticides in urban 
areas and rural villages; and the execution of projects that 
disturb or alter the natural balance of an ecosystem. 
  7. Forming support groups for government agencies and 
municipalities (watershed committees and environmental 
protection boards).%8. Improving the transfer of financial 
resources so that municipalities are able to handle duties of 
importance for the territorial and local administration and 
management of natural resources. 
  In summary, this bill is designed to create an instrument 
that, while far from being a panacea solving our many 
environmental problems, will provide a general framework for the 
operation of the state and civil society, and will implement a 
national strategy for sustainable development with justice and 
social equity.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 17 Nov (MENA)--Ambassador Hajar 
al-Islambuli, director of the Foreign Ministry's Economic 
Affairs Department and head of Egypt's delegation to the 
Environment Committee of the Middle East multilateral 
negotiations, has affirmed that Egypt is determined to raise the 
issue of pollution sources at the environment talks, 
particularly the pollution caused by nuclear waste. 
  Ambassador al-Islambuli held a joint news conference late 
last night with the delegation heads of the two countries 
sponsoring the peace conference--the United States and 
Russia--and the head of the Japanese delegation. Japan is 
sponsoring the environment group's work. 
  She said Egypt has focused light on nuclear pollution and on 
the need for all the region's countries to cooperate. 
  Israel, the United States, and Russia objected to the 
Egyptian proposal to place pollution caused by nuclear waste on 
the agenda of the environment working group and requested that 
the issue be referred to the Arms Control Committee. 
  In light of Egypt's insistence on its position and the Arab 
countries' support for the Egyptian stance, the committee 
decided to refer the issue to the advisory committee that 
supervises the multilateral negotiations' five groups. [passage 
omitted] 
  The head of the U.S. delegation said the participating 
delegations have agreed to set up emergency centers at the Gulf 
of Aqaba to combat environment pollution and desertification in 
the region. He added that the World Bank and Japan showed a 
readiness to contribute to these projects. 
  The head of the Japanese delegation said his country 
allocated $530,000 for the purpose. [passage omitted] 
  The head of the Japanese delegation--Japan chairs the 
environment working group--added that the Palestinian and 
Israeli delegations agreed to set up administrative structures 
to deal with environmental affairs in the occupied territories. 
He noted that the formation of such structures is stipulated in 
the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles signed in 
Washington on 13 September. 
  He said the participating delegations discussed a proposal 
to 
hold another meeting in Cairo to address the aspects of what is 
called the constitution on dealing with environmental issues. 
He added that proposals were put forward to set up a data bank 
in the Gaza Strip to help exchange information with environment 
centers and other proposals to set up an emergency center to 
combat pollution in Aqaba. He noted that Italy proposed a 
seminar on solid waste in the region and means to combat 
pollution. [passage omitted] 
  Ambassador al-Islambuli said Egypt is committed to 
continuous 
work and cooperation with all the parties to the peace process 
and that this commitment is very clear on every track of the 
negotiations. 
  She said Egypt could raise the issue of dealing with marine 
pollution in the East Mediterranean, an issue supported by the 
EC, which proposed projects in this respect and showed a 
willingness to finance them. 
  On Syria and Lebanon's boycott of the multilateral talks, 
the 
head of the Russian delegation expressed the hope that the two 
countries would join the talks soon. 
  Commenting on this point, the head of the U.S. delegation 
said he believes that the multilateral talks complement what 
takes place on bilateral tracks and expressed the hope that 
Syria and Lebanon will soon join these negotiations.

  [Text] Cairo, 16 Nov (MENA)--The Environment Committee, 
which is a subcommittee of the multilateral negotiations of the 
conference on peace in the Middle East, concluded its meetings 
in Cairo this evening. 
  The final session went three hours over the time set for it 
to provide opportunity for further discussions, especially with 
regard to a number of disputed issues, such as contamination 
resulting from nuclear wastes and the prominence the U.S. 
delegation gave to the issue of pollution in the Gulf of Aqaba. 
  During the final session, the conferees followed up on 
issues 
relating to preserving the environment, particularly marine 
pollution and other sources of pollution, such as chemical 
wastes, as well as exploiting the potential of each state in the 
region. 
  During the discussions, they agreed on some standards and 
measures to organize international and regional efforts to 
preserve the environment, which is the project Japan presented 
to the conference. They also agreed to carry out further 
studies to help combat pollution, prevent environmental 
catastrophes, and resolve the issue of oil spillage into the 
Gulf of Aqaba, which is bordered by four countries: Saudi 
Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Israel. This is a project that the 
[words indistinct] refused to address now. 
  The statement issued by the conference, the meetings of 
which 
continued for four days with the participation of more than 44 
countries and numerous international bodies concerned about 
environmental issues, noted that the United States and Russia, 
the cosponsors of the multilateral talks, [words indistinct] the 
EC, and Japan, showed their willingness to fund projects they 
want to carry out in the region. 
  [Words indistinct] stated that Egypt asked that the issue of 
nuclear wastes be listed on the talks' agenda, but Russia, 
Israel, and the United States objected to it. They demanded 
that this subject be referred to the Arms Limitation Committee. 
This upset Egypt and the Arab delegations. 
  Saudi Arabia, the Gulf countries, and the Palestinians 
supported Egypt's stand in this regard and decided to refer the 
whole issue to the Steering Committee [words indistinct] the 
five committees of the conference. 
  On the other hand, conference circles denied reports about 
reaching an agreement on setting up an [word indistinct] center 
in Jordan, from which Israel could benefit. 
  The head of the Economic Department of the Foreign Ministry 
chaired Egypt's delegation to these meetings.

  [Text] There has been a first practical breakthrough in the 
multilateral talks on environmental issues. A joint 
Jordanian-Israeli mechanism was established at the Cairo 
conference in order to deal with sea pollution in al-'Aqabah and 
to protect the gulf's coral reefs. Our correspondent Shulamit 
Schmerling reports that the other delegations participating in 
the talks, including the World Bank, agreed to help finance the 
joint mechanism.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Nov (MENA)--The Environment Committee of 
the multilateral talks stemming from the Madrid Middle East 
peace conference began its meetings in Cairo this morning. 
Egypt's delegation to the two-day meetings is led by Ambassador 
Hajar al-Islambuli, director of the Economic Affairs Department 
in the Foreign Ministry. 
  The participants in the meetings will discuss the problem of 
desertification in the Middle East; the disposal of contaminated 
and solid wastes, particularly from oil; and pollution in the 
Gulf of Aqaba, which Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Israel 
overlook. Delegates from more than 40 countries in the Middle 
East, the Gulf, the Arab Maghreb, and Europe, in addition to the 
United States, Canada, Russia, China, and Japan, are taking part 
in the meetings. The committee meetings have been boycotted by 
both Syria and Lebanon, which are making progress on the 
bilateral tracks a condition for their attendance at the 
multilateral talks. 
  Sources close to the committee, which Egypt is hosting, have 
stated that the group will try to put the ideas and proposals 
discussed at previous meetings into practice. During previous 
meetings, the United States and some world major powers promised 
to bear the costs of the projects related to this issue in the 
region. The sources noted the importance of the discussions 
conducted by the five committees stemming from the multilateral 
talks, which are arms control, water, economic development, 
refugees, and environment. 
  Addressing the opening session, Assistant Foreign Minister 
'Adil al-Safti emphasized that the new atmosphere of peace in 
the Middle East provides a chance for progress on all the peace 
tracks. He noted that progress in the bilateral talks will give 
the countries that are not participating in the multilateral 
talks the chance to do so. He noted that Egypt and the region's 
countries attach importance to the environment and the need to 
protect it. He added that if economic development does not take 
the need for a clean environment into account, it will be 
incomplete. He stressed that Egypt calls for establishing 
regional cooperation to protect the environment. 
  He reiterated Egypt's firm position that progress in the 
various areas of cooperation among the region's countries 
depends on progress in the bilateral talks. Al-Safti noted that 
the establishment of a just peace in the Middle East will give 
rise to the establishment of regional cooperation on a sound 
basis that serves the interests of the region's people. 
  The two-day meetings will examine all issues related to 
environmental protection and ways to deal with the 
desertification and drought affecting some of the region's 
countries.

  [Text] Hyderabad, Oct l -- The Union Minister of State for 
Industries, Mrs. Krishna Sahi, stated here on Thursday that the 
Central government had issued instructions for the industrial 
units to comply with emission standards, latest by the year-end 
or face closure. 
  Inaugurating a national seminar on pollution control 
methods, 
organised by the Andhra Pradesh Central Public Sector Employees 
Federation (APCPSEF) here, the union minister said the Centre 
had announced a number of initiatives for industries to adopt 
pollution control measures. Apart from instituting awards for 
achieving maximum pollution control, the government had also 
extended concessions in duty on pollution control equipments, 
she added. 
  In addition, the government had embarked upon raising public 
awareness on environmental issues through education and 
publicity in mass media, she said. Even voluntary organisations 
could play a role in this aspect as only the government's 
efforts would not be enough, she pointed out. 
  Mrs. Sahi observed that though several safeguards were 
provided through legislations and enforcements, they were 
insufficient as awareness in public as well as among 
decision-makers was required to improve environment. 
  Stating that combating pollution did not mean halting 
industrialisation, she added that while this should be 
encouraged on one hand, an attempt should be made to strike a 
balance with nature and protect the environment. 
  The union minister said efforts were being made for paper 
manufacturers to switch over to agricultural wastes and bagasse 
as raw material instead of the traditional wood based activity. 
The paper industry based on wood would continue to be under 
compulsory licensing, she said adding that paper manufacturers 
from agricultural wastes would be delicensed. 
  Leather industry was one of the largest foreign exchange 
earners as well as a source of water pollution due to tanning of 
hides from raw to semi-finished stage, she said adding that the 
State governments have set up common effluent treatment plants 
for clusters of tanneries and were proposing to relocate the 
tanneries from the urban areas to minimise pollution.

<F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondent Lidiya Peresypkina -- TASS] </F>
  [Text] Minsk, Dec 1 -- Specialists have spent three years 
working on an updated and amplified chart of cesium-137 
contamination of territory in the states of the former Union. 
The new chart synthesizes and summarizes data obtained from 
gamma-spectrometric analysis of numerous soil samples and 
gamma-spectrometric surveys from the air. 
  ``This updated chart reflects the third post-Chernobyl 
period, which began in 1988,'' Yuriy Pokumeyko, head of the 
Belarus hydrometeorological service says. ``The radiation 
situation is now dominated by cesium-137, strontium-90 and 
plutonium-238, -239, - 240, and -241, whose half-life ranges 
from a minimum of 12 years to a maximum of almost 25,000 years. 
The breakdown, by republics, of contamination by long-life 
radionuclides with a density of one curie per square kilometre 
and above is now as follows: Belarus -- 23 percent of the 
republic's total area, Ukraine -- 5.2 percent, and Russia 0.6 
percent. The worst affected areas are Gomel, Mogilev, Zhitomir, 
Rovno, Kiev, Bryansk, Tula and Orel oblasts. I wish to point 
out that, as far as Russia is concerned, the chart has been 
augmented with information about strontium-90 contamination 
resulting from the Kyshtym accident in the Urals.''

<F P=106> [Article by Roman Zadunayskiy: ``Landscape After Battle''] </F>
  [Text] Masts and superstructures protruding from beneath 
the water, patches of black oil and rust from sunken ships 
drifting across its smooth surface. This is not a scene from 
wartime. I chanced upon it quite recently in a corner of the 
harbor of Baltiysk, the Baltic Fleet's main base. As local 
officers explained to me, some bigwig here in Brezhnev's time 
got it into his head that ships that were written off could not 
be left afloat while waiting to be cut into sections and melted 
down. So old cruisers and destroyers were sunk in a secluded 
corner of the bay. But the years go by and no one is in any 
hurry to process them. How many more graveyards like this are 
there across Russia? 
  I also recently visited an air defense unit stationed in a 
forest outside Moscow. In the unit itself everything gleams 
with cleanliness; armed with cloths, the soldiers polish and 
shine the missile launchers' various brass mechanisms. But the 
landscape around the unit looks as if it has been hit by a 
nuclear apocalypse. Carpenter should make his movies here. No 
props are needed. Tonnes of stomach-churning garbage are piled 
in sandpits. Its army origins are betrayed by the presence of 
oil, petroleum residue, old boots, gas masks, and broken, bent 
parts of military equipment. 
  Complaints against the former Soviet Army for defiling 
nature 
have now grown to enormous proportions. Many millions of 
dollars in compensation for environmental damage are being 
demanded by the Baltic peoples, Hungarians, Poles, Czechs, and 
Germans. International conferences and seminars were even held 
recently in Berlin and Budapest to discuss measures to overcome 
the environmental damage done in Eastern Europe by the Soviet 
Army. Exhausted by endless economic and political crisis, Russia 
and the other CIS countries are keeping quiet at present. But a 
huge scandal is inevitable. In an attempt to forestall it, the 
Russian Defense Ministry has proposed that the Russian 
Federation Armed Forces set up an environmental service and 
eliminate any ``imperfections.'' 
  It is clear even from the information doled out by Colonel 
General V. Toporov, Russian deputy defense minister and member 
of the Security Council's Interdepartmental Commission for 
Environmental Safety, that the crisis has come to a head. 
According to him, 9 million hectares of Russian land are 
polluted simply as a result of operating space rocket complexes 
(fuel components and metallic fragments of detachable rocket 
stages). Because of the complex environmental situation, the 
administrations of Altay Republic, Omsk Oblast, Tomsk Oblast, 
and Arkhangelsk Oblast have banned the launch of space vehicles 
and rockets until environmental certification of regions where 
detachable rocket stages have landed is complete. 
  The serious radioactivity situation in the seas and on the 
territory of a number of garrisons (units) is the result of 
activity by the Navy and Defense Ministry test sites and 
institutions. Because of the poor technical state and low level 
of maintenance of fuel depots at military airfields built in the 
fifties and sixties (Engels, Mozdok, Yeysk, and other cities), 
soil and groundwater pollution occurs on a significant scale. 
In virtually every garrison, as much as 45 percent of sewage is 
untreated. 
  According to Deputy Minister V. Toporov, fines imposed on 
military units for pollution of the environment in 1992 amounted 
to 43.5 million rubles [R] at today's prices. This year, 
however, one air garrison in the city of Engels alone has been 
fined more than R24 billion! 
  Moreover, the recycling and destruction of nuclear, 
chemical, 
and conventional weapons are leading to even greater ecological 
pressures on the environment. And if you consider the sinking 
of nuclear-powered vessels' nuclear reactors and containers of 
radioactive materials, the dumping of toxic waste, and so 
forth!... 
  The Defense Ministry feels that the main reasons for the 
serious environmental situation in the Army and the Navy are the 
lack among the troops of a developed system of environmental 
organs, forces, and material and financial resources. It cites 
the example of NATO armies, which try to protect nature. 
  It is proposed to set up an environmental service in the 
Russian Federation Armed Forces. The Russian president has 
already prepared the relevant draft edict. The Finance Ministry 
is told to allocate considerable resources for this purpose. 
  But there is one vital shortcoming in this good venture: The 
environmental service will be a subordinate body whose financing 
and promotion of officers will depend on the defense minister 
and lower-ranking military officials. Will this not lead to the 
covering up of accidents and to a situation where the extent of 
the damage caused by Army sites is ``glossed over?'' Perhaps 
the most acceptable option would be for the Russian Federation 
Armed Forces environmental service to become an independent, 
economically accountable body financed from the national budget 
and led not only by the Russian Defense Ministry, but also by 
the Ministry for Protection of the Environment and the Security 
Council under the president's personal control?

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nevelskiy: ``The Radiation Echo of the </F>
Komsomolets Tragedy Has Apparently Been Exaggerated''] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- The third expedition in two years 
on board the scientific research ship ``Akademik Mstislav 
Keldysh'' has completed its work in the area where the nuclear 
submarine Komsomolets foundered. We asked Doctor of Medical 
Sciences Prof. I. Lisovskiy, member of the Russian Scientific 
Commission for Radiation Protection, to talk about the research 
that had been carried out. 
  Lisovskiy: ``The expedition in which I had 
occasion to participate had two main tasks: to evaluate the 
radiation and ecological situation at the scene of the disaster 
and to obtain data on whether it is advisable to raise the 
submarine.'' 
  ``We were able to carry out the necessary research primarily 
with the help of the ship's two `Mir' deep-sea submersibles. 
These miniature submarines are highly mobile, autonomous, and 
capable of operating at great depths for days (the working depth 
is up to 6,000 meters).'' 
  ``During the very first reconnaissance descent I found that 
deep-sea work near the sunken submarine was perfectly safe. 
Background radiation there was extremely slight, of the order of 
four microroentgens per hour. In the course of subsequent 
investigations over the past two years we have obtained no data 
showing any change in the radiation situation or possible 
deterioration in the future. There is every reason to believe 
that the site is safe from the radiation viewpoint and that the 
panic predictions of imminent, major radiation contamination of 
the northern seas were based on unreliable supposition.'' 
  ``During the latest expedition I was able to discuss the 
alarming conclusions drawn on the basis of theoretical 
calculations by certain scientific organizations in our country 
following the loss of the Komsomolets with Dutch Government 
expert Prof. A. van der Veyer [last name as transliterated], who 
was also participating in it. Although he was the 
representative of an interested party, he did not accept the 
alarming forecasts and also denied the possibility of events' 
taking a disastrous turn.'' 
  ``One year ago, using the most up-to-date equipment, we 
discovered for the first time and were now able to confirm that 
a slight amount of cesium-137 was escaping from the nuclear 
reactor. It was found only around the submarine's hull and could 
only be detected by highly sensitive direct gamma-spectrometry 
methods. The point is that the level of cesium-137 near the 
Komsomolets was approximately one-thousandth of the permissible 
level in drinking water that is consumed, for example, by the 
population of St. Petersburg.'' 
  ``One can add to this the fact that when we made similar 
measurements in the Baltic on the way back we established that 
deep in its waters the level of cesium-137 was 100 times higher 
than in the place where the nuclear submarine went down.'' 
  ``According to the engineers, including naval experts, the 
boat is rather badly broken, with its forward compartment 
particularly badly affected, and there is really no question of 
raising the Komsomolets intact. Any attempt of this kind could 
result in the submarine's simply breaking up. Experts are 
continuing to discuss the possibility of bringing the torpedo 
tubes together with the torpedoes, which contain the nuclear 
warheads, to the surface. But this operation is also too 
complex, expensive, and dangerous.'' 
  ``The only option under discussion at the moment which would 
not make the radiation situation worse is that of sealing the 
submarine with a chitin biopolymer (chitosan) or some other 
sealant. In particular, the chitin which is the main 
constituent of the integument of crustaceans, absorbs heavy 
metals, including radionuclides. A biopolymer based on it might 
well completely neutralize the Komsomolets' radioactive remains, 
if it were possible to pack its compartments with the 
substance.'' 
  ``One particular feature of the latest expedition was that 
it 
involved raising the rescue chamber of the Komsomolets in which 
several crew members had tried to escape. One man did escape. 
The rest died, because on surfacing the chamber immediately 
sank to the bottom.'' 
  ``The bell-shaped chamber lay approximately 300 meters from 
the submarine.'' 
  ``For over 1.5 km the raising procedure went according to 
plan, but when it got to within 100 meters of the surface the 
cable suddenly snapped.... So the fears of experts who believe 
that the removal of parts of the submarine could have serious 
consequences are warranted.''

<F P=106> [From the ``People's Earth'' program: Video report by </F>
Dilbar Klado, identified by caption; figures in brackets denote 
broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds] 
  [Excerpts] [080329] [Klado over video of submarine 
disappearing under water, shoals of fish, latest pictures of 
sunken Komsomolets submarine] The Soviet nuclear submarine 
Komsomolets caught fire and sank in the Norwegian Sea 7 April 
1989. This is not the only submarine which has sunk, but the 
attention which it attracts worldwide has serious reasons. The 
Komsomolets was fitted with everything that was the last word in 
submarine building. A fire was practically impossible. 
Nonetheless, it happened. The entire crew should have been 
able to save themselves in a special rescue chamber. However, 
only three people were able to get to it, and only one managed 
to get out alive. Furthermore, it appears that a few meters 
from the seabed an explosion occurred on the submarine. 
Furthermore, the highest grade alloys from which the hull and 
the interior of the submarine were made, including the king of 
metals -- titanium -- which was used unsparingly to build the 
advanced submarine are corroding at dangerous speeds. The 
submarine is lying on the slope of an underwater hill, as it 
were. This means that it is not silting up and it is futile to 
hope that it will eventually be buried together with its lethal 
cargo. What is more, the current, which is relatively strong, 
changes direction several times a day. This is creating the 
worse possible scenario for corrosion. [080437] 
  [080438 thru 08044 -- passage omitted -- interview with 
Tengiz Borisov chairman of KOPRON (committee for special purpose 
underwater operations)] 
  [080450] [Klado over video of underwater footage of 
sub] During this year's expedition it emerged that not only 
the thin outer wall but also the strong inner wall of the hull 
has been breached here and there. So was there an explosion 
after all? The white waterline on the nose of the submarine 
marks the division between two compartments. One holds 
conventional, the other nuclear torpedoes. A warhead is clearly 
visible through the hatch. It is a beautiful pale blue color. 
It is surrounded by a beard, so to speak -- a result of 
corrosion. Water has already seeped inside, turning the 
contents into a plutonium soup. The beryllium shell is all that 
separates the most toxic substance on Earth from the Norwegian 
Sea. So watch out! This hole was discovered only this year. 
  Tengiz Borisov: Any attempt to lift the submarine 
could lead to its disintegration and pollute the environment. 
So we cannot lift the submarine. Nor are we able to remove the 
warheads at this depth. It is not just that we cannot do it: 
No one in the world can carry out this operation. 
  Klado: It is dangerous, very dangerous. You can 
see how one bathyscaphe is trying to help another to repair the 
damaged screw at a depth of 1,700 meters. This is a device for 
measuring the speed of the current, and hence also the spread of 
radionuclides from the ship's reactor. It appears that this 
leak does not present a serious danger for the time being. 
  Various sorbents for measuring the presence of all possible 
radionuclides in the aura of the submarine are carried in a 
special compartment in the belly of the bathyscaphe. The 
sorbents are placed in special grapnels which are attached to 
the hull of the submarine or buried in the seabed for a time. 
Subsequently meausurements are carried out on the research ship 
Akademik Keldysh. Only plutonium requires a special procedure, 
which will be carried out at research institutes on the mainland. 
  Having completed their tasks on the Komsomolets, the 
researchers made their way to the Kara Sea where, using the same 
instruments, they took ecological measurements in areas where 
nuclear waste and nuclear reactors from submarines had been 
dumped. KAPRON, the Committee for Special Purpose Underwater 
Operations, will carry out such monitoring regularly from now 
on. [080733] [video shows extensive hitherto unseen

Article Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Kirichenko and Vladimir Umnov, under </F>
rubric ``Catastrophes'': ``If Urgent Steps Are Not Taken, a 
Plutonium Leak From the Komsomolets Submarine Is Possible as 
Early as Next Year''] 
  [Text] Recently the Mstislav Keldysh scientific ship 
returned from the Norwegian Sea. Participants in the expedition 
were Russian and foreign scientists and representatives of the 
RF [Russian Federation] government's Committee for Conducting 
Special-Purpose Underwater Operations (KOPRON). The data that 
was brought back does not simply say, but shouts, that it is 
necessary urgently to raise, if not the entire submarine, at 
least the missiles with nuclear warheads. 
  A PLUTONIUM LEAK IS POSSIBLE AS EARLY AS NEXT YEAR 
  As long as two years ago Igor Spasskiy, the general designer 
at the Rubin KB [Design Bureau], and the father of the 
Komsomolets, stated that the sea water had ``cracked'' the 
torpedo heads and the nuclear warheads had ``started to leak.'' 
  After the most recent expedition returned, KOPRON chairman 
Tengiz Borisov announced an even more threatening situation and 
the possible leaking of plutonium into the sea as early as late 
1994. 
  Tengiz Borisov says, ``As early as a couple of days after 
the 
Komsomolets went down, it became clear to me that this was 
possibly the prelude to a much more serious catastrophe. Once, 
in the North, a barge to which a titanium submarine had been 
moored for four months sank before my very eyes. It was even 
thought that that had been an act of sabotage. But when the 
barge was raised, it turned out that, while it had been in an 
ideal condition above the water line, below the water line it 
had been `eaten away' like Swiss cheese. And it was only at that 
time that people began thinking for the first time about 
electrochemical corrosion.'' 
  ``The Komsomolets also has a titanium hull, and in the 
presence of titanium other metals are subjected to corrosion at 
a very great speed. The designers, of course, stipulated an 
electrochemical shield, and it operates excellently, so long as 
the submarine is operating normally. But as soon as the 
submarine is filled with water, it immediately becomes a 
galvanic cell. And, according to the most modest estimates, a 
current of the order of 500 amperes is generated on the hull. 
The speed of the corrosion is greater than the usual speed by a 
factor of the order of 1.5-2 -- that is the finding of the 
academy's Institute of Physical Chemistry. On average, the water 
eats through 0.2 mm a year, but in the presence of titanium, as 
much as 20 mm.'' 
  The 1991 expedition revealed the presence of a radioactive 
background -- that is, within 2.5 years. True, the traces of 
radiation were insignificant. But the most terrifying thing was 
that it was discovered that the torpedo tubes had been damaged, 
and the warheads with the plutonium were in contact with the 
water. Plus the tremendous breaks in the hull. 
  Last year's expedition confirmed the worst fears: the 
warheads had actually broken apart, and in at least three 
torpedo tubes with nuclear warheads there is a long trail of 
products of corrosion. And it is only the design of the charge 
itself that, so far, is keeping the plutonium in the warheads. 
  A month ago, for the first time, the telescopic ``hands'' of 
the MIR-1 and MIR-2 deep-water bathyspheres made their way 
inside the submarine and took water samples for analysis. And an 
attempt was also made to raise a rescue chamber with the remains 
of the ship commander and several crew members. Unfortunately, 
because of the stormy weather, the cable broke as the rescue 
chamber was just 200 meters from the surface, and the chamber 
sank... 
  NYeG [NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA] DOSSIER 
  Most specialists agree that the leakage of plutonium 
into the sea, with regard to the force of its effect upon the 
environment, could prove to be much more frightening that the 
Chernobyl catastrophe. Nuclear leaks on land can be localized, 
if only theoretically, but in water it is impossible to collect 
the radioactive elements. 
  For the time being, fortunately, no leakage of 
plutonium has been recorded. But when it does get into the water 
-- and there are several kilograms of it in the torpedoes -- 
that will be too late. That amount is sufficient to make the 
Norwegian Sea unsuitable for fishing for hundreds of years. 
  ``The situation is worsened by the fact that it is rather 
complicated to detect plutonium. Very precise analyses are 
needed. Plutonium does not have natural gamma-radiation, but 
only alpha-activity. And in order for the instruments to 
indicate its presence, it is necessary to have the precision of 
a sniper to get to the place where, at the particular moment, 
there are considerable accumulations of it.'' 
  ``The ship lies within a 200-mile zone of Norway's economic 
interests. And if -- God forbid -- the Norwegians catch even a 
single herring with traces of plutonium, the area will be closed 
to fishing. The half-life of plutonium is 24,000 years. Taking 
into consideration the mixing of it with sea water, and its 
washout, that period is 600-700 years. We will have to pay 
hundreds of millions of dollars of compensation... I daresay 
that those amounts of money are not comparable with what is 
currently necessary to raise the ship.'' 
  CARRY OUT THE PLAN AT ANY COST? 
  According to T. Borisov's data, at the present time there do 
not exist, anywhere in the world, the technical means capable of 
raising the Komsomolets. Moreover, there is only one ship that 
is capable of sealing it off -- the American ship Glomar 
Challenger. 
  More than 20 foreign companies are ready to finance both the 
raising of the submarine, and the work of sealing it off, which 
the committee is planning to carry out no later than next summer. 
  Finally, the method of doing this has been selected. 
  NYeG DOSSIER 
  A large number of technologies were proposed, but as of 
this moment none of them has been fully developed or approved. 
In addition, there is no longer any time for this 
  The proposal was made to fill up the submarine with 
concrete. But in that instance it will be impossible to remove 
the warheads from it. Also, how will the concrete behave under 
the conditions of those depths and the salty sea water? No one 
knows. The plans to encase the submarine in a sarcophagus also 
failed. 
  The biotechnologists of the Sitek SP [joint venture] of the 
Far Eastern Branch of RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] proposed 
their solution. In September 1992 the scientists patented in the 
United States ``a method for isolating radioactive materials 
submerged in a water environment,'' with the aid of the 
biopolymer chitosan. The substance, which up until now has been 
used only in medicine and in the processing of waste products, 
is obtained from chitin -- the basic component of the shells of 
shrimp and crabs. Chitosan is one of the best adsorbents and 
excellently traps the ions of heavy metals. In a mixture with 
other components it forms a gel which, upon entering the water, 
turns into a hard sponge -- it is not damaged by washout or 
corrosion. 
  It is proposed to pump this substance under pressure into 
all 
the capacities of the sunken submarine. The radioactive elements 
that previously leaked through the cracks in the hull and in the 
torpedoes will be absorbed by this material. Taking into account 
the use of chitosan to ``catch'' the heavy metals for up to 80 
percent of its own weight, the nonleakage of radioactive 
elements is guaranteed, because their weight is never compared 
with the weight of the solution. 
  Incidentally, by no means everyone agrees with this plan. 
Some scientists, without denying that the sources of 
radioactivity have to be raised as quickly as possible, 
nevertheless express their fear: won't the reactor, to which the 
access of water will be closed, explode? That is why they 
propose using the chitosan to fill up only the reactor 
compartment and the torpedoes, and to cut them out of the 
submarine in sections and raise them to the surface. It is 
easier and quicker to do this than to attempt to raise the 
entire submarine from the tremendous depth. 
  But Tengiz Borisov gives these arguments: 
  ``Technology with the use of chitosan makes it possible to 
encase any ship at a depth of as much as 8000 meters -- with a 
safety guarantee of a minimum of a hundred years. Of course that 
is not enough. But it will be necessary to await the appearance 
either of new technology or new techniques. Or, if quantity 
makes the transition to quality, to build a special ship for 
this job.'' 
  There is one more paradox. Unlike our specialists, our 
Western colleagues worry more about the reactor than they do 
about the warheads. Some of them who also participated in the 
expedition on board the Mstislav Keldysh assert that the 
Cesium-137 from the reactor which appeared in the water analyses 
and the plutonium from the warheads settle excellently in the 
mud at the bottom of the sea and constitute absolutely no threat 
of ``killing'' the Norwegian Sea. And they cite a large number 
of examples with sunken reactors -- both ours and theirs. 
  At such time, for some reason, they fail completely to take 
into consideration the Russian data to the effect that 
sea-bottom currents that have not yet been explained have been 
discovered in the area of the Komsomolets -- currents with a 
speed of up to 1.5 meters a second. Periodically, underwater 
gales occur in this area. 
  In our country one can also hear voices stating that 
everything is not really so frightening, and that Borisov is 
just attempting to get more money for his committee by stating 
that the submarine has to be sealed off not only within the near 
future, but also at any cost... 
  It is difficult for us journalists to evaluate disputes 
among 
specialists. We are convinced of one thing: it is only in work 
that experience is accumulated. The proponents of raising the 
submarine have one more iron-clad argument with which it is 
difficult not to agree: it is necessary, to the extent possible, 
to raise the submarine in order to analyze the causes of the 
catastrophe and to avoid its repetition. 
  In confirmation of this argument the chairman of the RF 
government's Committee to Conduct Special Underwater Operations, 
captain first rank, experienced submariner and scientist Tengiz 
Borisov, says, ``I, as a career military man who has served on 
submarines, doubt that within the near future submariners will 
be threatened by unemployment.'' 
  P.S. It is proposed to carry out the operations to seal off 
the submarine next summer, after first using a Dutch cutter to 
cut away the forward compartment in exactly the place where the 
missiles with the warheads are located. NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA 
GAZETA pledges to keep you informed about the course of these 
operations.

<F P=106> [Interview with First Rank Captain Nikolay Vasilevich </F>
Petrov, chief of the 89th inspection of environmental protection 
of the Russian Sea Force for the Baltic Fleet, by O. 
Shcheblykin; place and date not given: ``There Is No Naval 
Ecology''] 
  [Text] 
  Shcheblykin: Nikolay Vasilevich, it is already a 
common opinion among ecologists that the Baltic Fleet is the 
main source of pollution in the region. Is this true? 
  Petrov: The Baltic Fleet can account only for a 
hundredth of a percent of the entire quantity of waste in 
Kaliningrad Oblast. The city municipal services and industrial 
enterprises should account for the remaining quota. Many towns 
in Kaliningrad Oblast still lack sewage disposal. Nevertheless, 
we cannot deny the fact that our ships pollute the environment. 
For example, antisubmarine ships that had been built in Germany 
have separators that purify water and collect residual oil 
products. Eleven supporting ships are also ecologically clean. 
They either had been built or repaired abroad and have the 
required purifying equipment. The remaining ships also have 
special equipment which allows to purify water until the 
concentration of oil products is 100 milligrams per 1 liter of 
water. According to the 1973 Convention, the overflow of waste 
from such ships is forbidden within a 200-mile coast zone. 
  In my opinion, the solution to this issue is the 
construction 
of a purifying station. It should be built in Baltiysk where 
most of our ships are stationed. 
  The collectors of oil products and waste which are at our 
disposal do not meet our demands. In addition, such 
ships-collectors spend a lot of time disposing of the collected 
waste. Civil institutions are reluctant to service military 
ships because they have to overhaul the civil ones first. 
  By the way, this waste can be later processed into 
industrial 
fuel. In Riga, for example, the fishing kolkhoz 
``Brisastselsh'' has been buying oil waste and processing it 
into industrial fuel. In our situation, the Baltic Fleet is 
paying for the processing of its waste, however, we do not get 
back any industrial fuel. 
  According to our accounts, a water purifying station will 
recover the investments in two-three years. Considering the 
fact that Baltiysk is going to acquire international 
recognition, the construction of a water purifying station will 
make it possible to decrease the pollution of the Baltic Sea. 
In addition, we have another source of pollution. In Baltiysk 
harbor, station KU-50, which performs purification of biological 
waste, has not been brought to full capacity. Hence, people's 
feces are overflowing to the Baltic Sea. 
  Shcheblykin: Do you see any way out of this 
situation? 
  Petrov: We count on eight collectors of oil 
products and waste which could be transported to us from 
Liepaja, Riga, and Tallinn. Despite the fact that these 
collectors are outdated, we hope that they could aid us in 
easing the ecological situation in the region. 
  Shcheblykin: Nikolay Vasilevich, in addition to 
ships, you have a complex of ground facilities, including 
motorcars, cantonments, fuel bases, in general, a great number 
of sites which could pollute the environment. How do they 
effect the environment? 
  Petrov: In the first half of 1993, we have been 
fined some 450,000 rubles because the Baltic Fleet had caused 
three oil overflows. 
  Our naval cantonments require complete reconstruction. For 
example, Khrabrovo sewage disposal has been under construction 
since 1974. It is a paradox, however, the new building needs 
repairing. This is out of the question. Moreover, the houses 
that are being built currently also lack sewage disposal. 
  In addition, I can lay charges on check points, technical 
services, and garages of our units. Exhaust emission in most of 
our cars is not regulated. Military motor vehicle inspectors 
[MAI] have no exhaust detectors and are not properly trained. I 
have repeatedly halted at MAI points, however, I have never 
gotten any answers regarding this issue from MAI inspectors. 
  I would like to draw attention of all commanders to 
performing ecological certification within the Baltic Fleet.

minister of environmental protection and natural resources: 
``One-Third of Russia's Territory Is the Most Valuable of What 
Remains on Earth as the Basis for Its Ecological Revival''] 
  [Text] In this article, at the request of ZELENYY 
MIR's editors, Professor V. I. Danilov-Danilyan, Russian 
Federation minister of environmental protection and natural 
resources, analyzes the problems of Russia's international 
cooperation in the field of protection of the environment, the 
disastrous state of which--typical for all Russia's industrial 
regions--is arousing profound concern throughout the world, 
especially in the developed countries. 
  Russia's present environmental condition stems from the 
deformed structure of the economy, the obsolescence and physical 
deterioration of most enterprises' fixed assets, and the lag in 
development of the infrastructure. A fundamental improvement is 
inconceivable without huge investments--in the amount of at 
least $1 trillion in order to attain the most modest normative 
indices of environmental impact. 
  Without precedent? Absolutely not! Thirty years ago a 
similar 
situation was observed in almost all the industrial states. But 
three decades of the development and consistent implementation 
of purposeful environmental policies have resulted in a 
fundamental improvement of the condition of the environment in 
the postindustrial countries--something, however, which cannot 
be said about the global environment situation. In practically 
all the developing states, it is steadily deteriorating, partly 
because the change for the better in the developed countries has 
been brought about by their export of polluting production 
facilities to the developing countries. 
  What is unprecedented, however, is the socioeconomic and 
political situation in Russia: in the past 30 or even 40 years 
not a single country with a developed market economy has 
experienced such an investment crisis. The traditional means of 
actualizing Russia's economic potential--by expanding the volume 
of resources drawn into production--is, nonetheless, 
unacceptable from both global and national viewpoints and is 
fundamentally contrary not only to environmental interests and 
restrictions, but also to economically sound principles of 
development under present conditions. 
  At the same time, more than one-third of Russia's vast 
territory is practically untouched by economic activity, and 
those lands represent the most valuable of what remains on the 
planet as the basis for its ecological revival. It can be 
considered to have been firmly established that in order to 
prevent the irreversible degradation of the biosphere we must 
not only preserve but increase the territories left without 
economic utilization. 
  The problems of the environment are confidently moving to 
occupy the highest place in international relations. The UN 
Conference on the Environment and Development that was held in 
Brazil last year was devoted to them; it defined the basic 
principles of economic development that does not destroy its own 
natural foundation (``Agenda for the 21st Century'') and founded 
a new UN agency--the Commission on Sustainable Development, 
which held its first session in June 1993. At the conference in 
Rio, the special status of countries with a transitional economy 
was established for the first time in official UN documents. 
  For the standpoint of the Rio documents, one must note that 
the necessary foundations for implementing an 
environmental-protection policy have been laid in Russia: There 
is a network for monitoring the condition of the environment, a 
system of agencies for environmental protection and regulation 
of the use of natural resources has been developed (both 
vertically and horizontally), an environmental expert review 
board is in operation, a legislative basis for 
environmental-protection activities is being created, 
environmental programs are being drawn up, a system of specially 
protected territories is being developed (nature preserves, 
national parks, nature reserves, etc.), reports are regularly 
published on the state of the environment, a ``red book'' is 
maintained, and so forth. 
  The existence of such a foundation, in the first place, and 
the specific features of the structure of Russia's economy, in 
the second place, account for an extremely important 
circumstance: in terms of environmental impact, investments in 
the reconstruction of Russia's economy (and that of certain 
other countries with a transitional economy) surpass any other 
areas of capital investments. Along with recognition of the 
environmental danger that our economy represents, this 
circumstance determines the interest of the developed countries, 
especially the Group of Seven, in the question of 
environmentally oriented investments in Russia, and in credits 
and technical assistance for the purposes of developing the 
environmental-protection system and implementing environmental 
programs and measures to enhance ecological security. 
  At present this interest has been manifested (on the level 
of 
preliminary negotiations, or of agreements that are being 
drafted or have been signed, or of projects that have begun to 
be carried out) with respect to five chiefly concrete forms of 
cooperation. 
  1. The writing off of part of Russia's foreign debts in the 
event of our implementation of environmental-protection measures 
that are of general interest (the construction of an enterprise 
to process radioactive waste--especially in the Far East, is in 
Japan's interests, for example, while the development of a 
system for monitoring environmentally hazardous facilities based 
on satellite communications with access for other countries' 
environmental-protection services, and other such projects are 
in the interests of the entire world community). 
  2. Credits and technical assistance for the development and 
implementation of such projects (this pertains especially to 
nuclear power engineering--the early shutdown of 
first-generation reactors and the bringing of newer ones up to 
standards, the implementation of energy-conservation measures 
that will provide for corresponding transformations in nuclear 
power engineering). 
  3. The development of a project for a World Bank 
``ecological 
loan,'' which is a top priority for Russia--a project which is 
being completed this September through the efforts of a special 
mission of the World Bank and the Russian Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. 
  4. Numerous questions of multilateral and bilateral 
cooperation--Russia participates in 16 multilateral and 27 
bilateral environmental agreements. 
  5. The stepping up of cooperation with the European 
Community 
to address the most acute environmental problems in Europe and 
the according of the highest priority to those problems. 
  It is in Russia's interests at the present time to strive 
for 
the conclusion of agreements on repaying part of its foreign 
debt by carrying out environmental measures for their full value 
and, in the case of investments in projects partially aimed at 
environmental goals (the shift to technologies reducing the 
discharge of greenhouse gases, etc.)--for a corresponding part 
of their value. 
  Russia should try to obtain both credits on favorable terms 
and technical assistance for carrying out projects related to 
the reconstruction of environmentally hazardous production 
facilities, the reduction of resource consumption, and removal 
of the barriers to the penetration of environmentally friendly 
products of Russian enterprises into the world market (space 
probing and mapping, environmental monitoring devices, etc.). 
  The announcement that an ``ecological loan'' in the World 
Bank was of high priority for the Russian Federation would 
strengthen Russia's position on all other issues and demonstrate 
our responsible attitude toward Russia's environmental problems 
that are of concern to the whole world. 
  In the course of various talks, we should push the idea of 
the need to develop, in conjunction with the Commission of the 
European Communities, a special environmentally oriented program 
of technical assistance to Russia, and should explain that the 
decisions of the UN Conference on the Environment and 
Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), the Environment for Europe 
Conference (Lucerne, 1993), and the first session of the UN 
Commission on Sustainable Development (New York, 1993) are being 
consistently implemented in Russia, and that the necessary 
foundation has been created in Russia for the consistent pursuit 
of policy in the area of environmental protection and resource 
conservation. And that not only reducing the negative impact of 
Russia's economy on the environment and reconstructing 
(eliminating) environmentally hazardous production facilities, 
but keeping vast territories of the country untouched by 
economic activity are essential to averting planetary 
environmental disaster.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Vladimirovich Yablokov, Russian </F>
presidential adviser on questions of ecology and health 
protection, conducted by ZELENYY MIR correspondent Olga 
Filatova: ``Life Without Danger.'' Subject of the interview is 
the newly operating agency of the Russian Council on Security] 
  [Text] Life without danger is practically impossible. 
However, mankind must reduce the ecological risk to a minimum if 
it does not want to perish. 
  Correspondent: Aleksey Vladimirovich, what are the 
basic tasks and functions of the MVK--the Interdepartmental 
Commission on Ecological Security of the Russian Council on 
Security? 
  Yablokov: The statute on the commission, ratified 
by the Presidential Edict of 13 July of this year, defines its 
three main tasks: Appraisal of the ecological threats and 
sources of ecological security for the individual, society and 
the state; Analysis of the information on functioning of systems 
of ecological security provision and aid in coordinating the 
activity of the federal agencies in this sphere, and preparation 
of predictions on the status of the ecological security of 
Russia. 
  Based on its analytical work, the MVK must prepare proposals 
for review by the Council on Security, as well as drafts of its 
appropriate decisions and drafts of normative statutes on 
ecological security. And it must also submit materials for the 
``White Book''--the annual report on national security presented 
by the President of Russia. Of course, as relates to questions 
of ecological security. 
  The principles for a normative base are present: The Russian 
Federation law, ``On Security,'' a number of decrees by the 
Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, edicts by the president, 
decrees and orders by the Russian government, and the 
recommendational legislative statute, ``On Principles of 
Ecological Security in the Commonwealth States.'' Currently in 
the stage of review are draft laws on ecological security, on 
the protection of the population against natural disasters, on 
the transport of special cargo, on especially dangerous toxic 
substances, on the protection of the territory of Russia against 
the import and spread of especially dangerous infections and 
toxic substances, and an entire series of others. 
  There are several special federal structures which are 
directly related to the provision of ecological security. Among 
them are Minpriroda [Ministry on Nature] (with an administration 
on ecological security), the State Committee on Emergency 
Situations (GKChS), Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight], Gosatomnadzor [State 
Committee on Nuclear Oversight], Gostekhnadzor [State Committee 
on Technical Oversight], KOPRON [not further identified] and the 
Committee on Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological 
Weapons--specialized federal structures which are also 
associated with ecological security. The powerful structures 
which maintain and ensure the informational block of ecological 
security are: Rosgidromet [Russian Federal Service on 
Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control], Roskomzem [Russian 
Federation Committee on Land Resources and Land Management], 
Roskomvod [Russian Federation Committee on Water Resources and 
Water Management], GoskomChernobyl [Russian Federation State 
Committee on Social Protection of Civilians and Rehabilitation 
of Territories Suffering from Chernobyl and Other Radiation 
Catastrophes], GoskomSever [RF Committee on the Socioeconomic 
Development of the North], and Goskomnats [RF Committee on 
Nationalities]. The Foreign Intelligence Service and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in recent times also the 
Ministry of Defense, have given serious attention to questions 
of ecological security. And within the government there are 
several specialized commissions operating which are associated 
with questions of ecological security. 
  Correspondent: And so, there is a branched system 
of state structures associated with the resolution of problems 
of ecological security. An extensive normative base has been 
created, yet the problems of the country's ecological security 
are multiplying... How can we explain this? 
  Yablokov: By three main reasons. First of all--by 
the transitional character of our society, with its political, 
and this means also its administrative, instability. 
Secondly--by the economic chaos. These reasons determine the 
inadequate attention to the problem of ecological security. And 
thirdly--by the inadequate development of the theoretical and 
applied aspects of the problem of ecological security in Russia. 
About 10 years ago, the President of the Academy of Sciences 
could, for example, publicly announce the absolute safety of 
nuclear power production, and even offer to build a 
Chernobyl-type reactor in Red Square... 
  Within the memory of our generation, great ecological 
catastrophes of a global scale were consciously planned (!) in 
our country. One of them--the destruction of the Aral Sea--was 
almost fully implemented. Others, like the famous turning of the 
northern and Siberian rivers, were blocked, fortunately. 
Ignoring the problems of ecological security led to the creation 
and accumulation of nuclear missile and chemical weapons without 
development of plans for their utilization, as well as to the 
creation of gigantic nuclear power plants without development of 
plans for their operational de-commission, despite the fact that 
the service life of an AES [nuclear power plant] is rather 
short--30-40 years. 
  All this testifies to the fact that in the very recent past 
the country had no conception of ecological security. 
  Correspondent: Evidently today, after the 
Chernobyl catastrophe, theoretical and practical developments in 
the sphere of ecological security are being conducted 
intensively and principally in Russia? 
  Yablokov: They are in the stages of inception as 
compared with what has been done abroad over the last 15-20 
years. The pivotal point of the conception of ecological 
security in the world has been recognized to be the theory of 
ecological risk, and its applied part--determination of the 
level of acceptable risk. This risk, naturally, is largely 
defined by the effects on human health. 
  Take a look at this figure (Fig. 1), which presents the 
results of one such development for the USA. And take note: 
Nothing of the sort has yet been done for the conditions in 
Russia! And the sooner we attain the world level of theoretical 
and practical developments in this sphere, the more successful 
we will be in solving the problem of ensuring the country's 
national ecological security. Only in November of 1991, within 
the framework of the State Council of Russia, were the basic 
conceptions of ecological security developed in our country, and 
a year later the Minpriroda of Russia developed the basics for a 
conception of a federal program, ``Ecological Security of 
Russia.'' Only at the beginning of the current year was the 
``Conception for Ecological Security of Russia'' reviewed and 
adopted. 



  In March, the Russian Federation Council on Security 
reviewed 
the question of the state of health of Russia's population, 
including also in connection with the country's ecological 
status. Huge losses in the vital and labor potential of the 
population became apparent, primarily a reduction of the life 
expectancy, conditioned by ecological dangers. 
  There is currently a growing understanding of the importance 
of including the components of ecological security in the 
structure of national security. A confirmation of this fact is 
the activity of the State Committee on Emergency Situations, of 
federal inspections, of a number of other federal agencies of 
executive power, as well as of the Supreme Soviet. Graphically, 
the variant of isolating the component of ecological security 
within the overall structure of security of the individual, 
society and the state appears as follows, as you see in this 
figure (Fig. 2). 



  Correspondent: Thus, the ecological security of 
the country is not ensured to the proper degree? Then--your 
arguments. 
  Yablokov: The zones of ecological disaster and 
unfavorability are expanding. Today they occupy around 15 
percent of the entire territory of Russia. The decline in the 
average life expectancy is continuing. The illness rate 
associated with the effect of ecological factors is increasing. 
Biological diversity is decreasing, the soil covering is 
deteriorating, and the quality of surface and underground waters 
is declining. Technologically caused accidents and catastrophes 
which have negative ecological consequences are becoming more 
frequent. And this is far from the complete picture of negative 
tendencies in the state of health of the population and the 
quality of the environment in many regions of Russia. 
  Correspondent: The most varied ministries and 
departments must submit their proposals to the MVK on problems 
of ecological security. So, will it deal with everything at 
once? That is unrealistic... What problems does the MVK intend 
to review first of all? 
  Yablokov: The emphasis must be placed on solving 
two continuous problems. On a comparative evaluation of all (in 
the country as a whole as well as for the major 
economic-geographical regions) significant ecological risks, and 
on a definition of the mechanism of management of each specific 
ecological risk for the purpose of its reduction to an 
acceptable level. 
  Correspondent: Which of the problems of ecological 
security are most promising for review in your commission? 
  Yablokov: The ecological risk of industrial 
accidents and catastrophes and the development of traditional, 
nuclear and other forms of power production. The risk in the 
basic sectors of industry, in transport and in agriculture. This 
is the ecological risk associated with radioactive contamination 
of the environment--including from RAO [not further identified] 
and AES [nuclear power plants]; With the formation, transport 
and burial of various waste products, including hazardous 
industrial waste; With the pollution of drinking water, the 
surface and underground waters; With conversion of the defense 

<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-004C-48A>           Figure 1. </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-004C-49A>           Figure 2. Structure of National Security </FIG>

sectors of industry and military activity--including also with 
the destruction of chemical and nuclear weapons and missiles, as 
well as the destruction of a significant portion of the almost 2 
million tonnes of conventional ammunition, some of which has 
been stored since the time of World War I; With the adoption of 
large-scale projects of natural resource utilization--for 
example, the assimilation of new oil and gas deposits on land 
and sea; With large-scale transport construction, including of 
the major seaport in Luzhskaya Inlet and a high-speed train from 
Moscow to Siberia. And finally, this is a question of reducing 
the level of ecological danger in the zones of ecological 
disaster and unfavorability. 
  Aside from these ecological dangers which are mentioned and 
discussed with relative frequency, it is very important for us 
to evaluate also an entire series of other, nontraditional, 
ones. Among them are: The ecological risk of depletion and 
plunder of plant and animal natural resources; The loss of 
wetlands, including swamps, and the effect of super-low doses of 
pollutants. Moreover, we must also evaluate the ecological risks 
associated with the large-scale development of space, foreign 
economic activity, privatization and the development of nonstate 
forms of ownership, the loss of soil fertility, the decline in 
recrational capacity of the territories, etc. 
  Correspondent: The MVK deals primarily with our, 
Russian, problems. Yet ecological catastrophes know no 
boundaries... 
  Yablokov: We are also entering onto the global 
level. We need an objective evaluation of the ecological risk to 
Russia associated with the global change in climate, the 
depletion of the ozone layer, and the loss of biological 
diversity. 
  Correspondent: Tell us about the MVK's plans of 
work for the near future... You said that you would like to and 
are planning to review one major problematic and one more 
specific question at monthly meetings of the MVK... 
  Yablokov: Since the review of major problems 
requires serious preparation, at the first regular meeting we 
are proposing to introduce the question of ecological 
consequences of accidents and catastrophes, which has already 
been worked out in detail. Many of the commission members 
participated in the review of this question by the Council on 
Ecological Policy under the President of Russia. At that time, 
after analysis of numerous departmental materials, it was 
decided that this question deserves review by the Council on 
Security. 
  There are also plans to review in the MVK such major 
problems 
as the threat to national security posed by radioactive 
contamination of Russia and the threat to national security 
associated with the loss of soil fertility, which is 
catastrophic in its scope. 
  Correspondent: Who will prepare these questions 
for discussion in the MVK? 
  Yablokov: The second of these two questions will 
be prepared by Roskomzem. The foundation for serious review of 
the first has long ago been laid by the draft of the State 
Program for Radioactive Waste Management. 
  Before the end of the year, the MVK intends to analyze the 
situation with the sunken nuclear submarine 
``Komsomolets''--based on data collected in August by a special 
expedition. And also to review the course of preparation of the 
section on ecological security in the report on national 
security presented by the President of Russia. 
  Correspondent: The MVK is in a period of 
formulation, and, like any new formation, it probably has its 
difficulties. What are they? Or is the MVK an exception to the 
rule in today's Russian reality, since both extra-class 
specialists and those who previously worked together on many 
problems have gathered here? 
  Yablokov: There are, of course, several 
organizational problems which demand urgent solution. And the 
first of these is obtaining current day-to-day and analytical 
information on ecological security. This problem may be solved 
with the aid of the available systems of information existing 
within the State Committee on Emergency Situations, Rosgidromet, 
Gossanepidnadzor, Gosgortekhnadzor [Russian Federal Mining and 
Industrial Oversight], Gosatomnadzor and a number of other 
departments and ministries. 
  The GKChS already today presents daily summaries to the 
agencies of state administration, while Rosgidromet issues 
monthly and quarterly reports. And if all the inspections and 
Rosgidromet began presenting brief ecological summaries to the 
MVK on a weekly basis, Minpriroda and the MBR [Russian 
Federation Ministry of Security]--on a monthly basis, and the 
Ministry of Defense, the Foreign Intelligence Service and the 
MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] and the territorial 
administrations--on a quarterly basis, then using these 
materials and an analysis of the reports of the mass media, the 
MVK associates could present brief monthly reports to the 
Council on Security Secretariat and to all the members of the 
MVK. And they could also formulate a section on ecological 
security for the president's annual report on national security. 
  With the organizational help of the Council on Security 
Secretariat, it will be possible to obtain a thorough analysis 
of the reports issued by the mass media. Perhaps we should make 
use of the appropriate experience of analytical services in the 
USA--and ask the CIA about this directly... 
  Correspondent: It is very important to inform the 
community in a timely manner about the work of your commission. 
According to the law, all ecological information must be 
accessible to the public. 
  Yablokov: But, on the other hand, this situation 
enters into some contradiction with certain limitations stemming 
from the demands of work by the Council on Security, as well as 
of national security in general. Perhaps the discussion of some 
questions will be open, and of some--closed. In any case, we 
will strive to give the press the maximum amount of information. 
Of course, it is necessary for the mass media workers themselves 
to understand the vital importance of ecological questions. 
Unfortunately, for the time being, with rare exceptions, this 
topic is put in last place. 
  As for internal organizational problems, they do exist, but 
we are effectively resolving them. 
  In general, we would like the MVK to work with maximal 
productivity, so that as a result of each meeting, drafts of 
Council on Security decisions, edicts and directives of the 
President of Russia, and recommendations to the federal and 
regional agencies of state administration would emerge.

  The Law on Protection of the Environment envisages the 
establishment of a unified system of nonbudgetary state 
environmental foundations--federal, republic, kray, oblast and 
local foundations. They are supposed to take part in solving 
urgent environmental-protection problems, restoring losses in 
the natural environment, compensating for damage that has been 
caused, and carrying out other environmental-protection 
measures. This system started functioning in practical terms a 
year ago. 
  The foundations' financial resources--ZELENYY MIR's 
readers know this--are being created in accordance with 
established normative rates, through the payments of enterprises 
and organizations that pollute the environment and fines for the 
violation of environmental-protection legislation. The law 
specifies that 60 percent of the money received by environmental 
foundations is to be used for environmental-protection measures 
at the city and rayon level 30 percent is to be used for 
measures at the kray and oblast level; and 10 percent is to be 
allocated to the Federal Environmental Foundation, whose 
activities have been of interest to ZELENYY MIR's readers with 
increasing frequency. 
  We believe that the following article by Academician V. 
L. Mozhin, chairman of that foundation's board, contains answers 
to most of the questions ZELENYY MIR has received about what the 
foundation's money will be spent on and what problems its board 
envisages tackling. 
  At present, in connection with the reduction of budgetary 
financing, the nonbudgetary environmental foundations are 
becoming one of the main investors in environmental-protection 
activities. 
  Over the past year the monies of the Federal Environmental 
Foundation were used for a broad spectrum of environmental 
measures. The greatest share went for participation in the 
financing of research and development on resource-conserving 
types of machinery and technology and control systems. 
Substantial funds were invested in the development and 
outfitting of nature preserves, national parks and nature 
reserves. Financial support was provided to organizations 
engaged in the environmental enlightenment and education of the 
public, and in various environmental publications. 
  To improve the activities of the whole system of 
foundations, 
serious work needs to be done on improving the normative rates 
of payments for pollution, a number of legal questions need to 
be resolved, and correct approaches, criteria and priorities in 
choosing specific environmental-protection measures to be 
financed out of the environmental foundations' monies need to be 
gradually figured out. 
  It appears that the monies of the Federal Environmental 
Foundation should be spent mainly for measures that ar of 
statewide significance. 
  In the system of instruments for the implementation of state 
policy in the area of environmental protection, an extremely 
important place belongs to interstate, federal and regional 
programs for addressing the most urgent environmental problems. 
These programs, which so far exist only in the form of drafts, 
have been adopted by the Federal Environmental Foundation as its 
main guidelines in selecting measures for financing. 
  The Waste Program. The total amount of all types 
of accumulated wastes in the Russian Federation comes to about 
50 billion tonnes; and the storage of them occupies about 
250,000 hectares of land space. Every year about 75 million 
tonnes of hazardous industrial wastes are formed. The purpose of 
the program is to meet one condition for the country's 
environmentally safe development: the stabilization and eventual 
reduction of environmental pollution and saving of natural 
resources through the maximum possible use of wastes in the 
economy. 
  The Ozone Program. The goal of the program is to 
ensure the step-by-step reduction of the production of 
ozone-destroying compounds, and the putting into production and 
use of ozone-safe coolants. 
  The Provision for the Conservation and Rational 
Utilization of Lake Baykal's Natural Resources Program. The 
program's goal is to ensure the stable development of the Baykal 
region and the restoration of Lake Baykal's unique ecosystems. 
  The Rational Utilization of Water Resources and 
Restoration of Water Quality Program, subprogram: The 
Saving and Rational Utilization of Water Resources in Moscow and 
Improvement of the Reliability of Its Water Supply (in the 
period up to 2000). The program's goal is the conservation and 
rational utilization of water resources, the development and 
implementation of measures to improve the quality of surface and 
ground waters, the development and introduction of 
environmentally clean water-use technologies, and the 
development of methods and equipment for the treatment of 
effluent and methods of intensifying the self-cleansing of 
bodies of water, including the attainment, in stages, of 
drinking-water quality in water-supply sources and bodies of 
water. 
  The Improvement of the Environmental Situation and 
Enhancement of the Volga Basin's Resource and Economic Potential 
(Revival of the Volga) Program. The need to develop the 
program stems from the especially complex environmental 
situation in the Volga basin. The program's goal is to improve 
the environmental situation in the Volga River basin. 
  The Ecological Improvement of the Environment and 
Protection of the Health of the Population of Tula Oblast in 
1993-1994 and in the Long Range up to 2000. The program's 
goal is to carry out an experiment in Tula Oblast in working out 
economic, organizational and legal methods for the ecological 
improvement of its territory and protection of the population's 
health. 
  The program has been approved by the Russian Federation 
government. 
  The Russia's Participation in Improving the 
Environmental Situation in the Sea Basins and the Arctic 
Program. The program's goal is the stabilization and 
improvement of the environmental situation in the basins of 
international seas; the provision of required scientific 
research for and development of specific measures at industrial 
and agricultural enterprises and in municipal services; and the 
provision for the protection and rational utilization of the 
natural resources of the Russian Arctic. 
  The Protection and Restoration of the Species Diversity 
of Fauna and Flora, and the Preservation of the Biota's Gene 
Pool Program. The program's goal is to ensure the 
nonexhaustive use of fauna and flora, and the development of new 
methods for preserving the gene pool and species diversity of 
flora and fauna. The idea here is to finance work to develop and 
support a system of especially protected natural territories. 
  Obviously, the development and implementation of the 
aforementioned programs will require many billions in outlays 
and fairly long time periods, and the Federal Environmental 
Foundation's financial capabilities will make it possible to 
take part in this work only within certain limits. But what is 
important is that, in selecting environmental-protection 
measures for financing, we will proceed on the basis of their 
importance to the implementation of the indicated programs, 
which are aimed at solving the most urgent problems. 
  In addition, the foundation is proposing to take part on a 
shared basis in the implementation of pilot programs for the 
development of certain environmental-protection and 
resource-conserving technological processes, units and 
production processes. 
  In accordance with the Statute on the Russian Federation 
Federal Environmental Foundation, it is also planned to provide 
financing for measures for the environmental upbringing and 
education of the population. 
  Financing of the development and implementation of specific 
programs and individual measures will be carried out in 
accordance with the Statute on the Russian Federation Federal 
Environmental Foundation and on the basis of statements of 
requirement and technical and economic feasibility studies 
presented by clients of programs or projects. 
  The results of the activities of the environmental 
foundations' system will in large part depend on the success 
achieved in organizing the joint work of the federal and 
territorial foundations. 
  The strengthening of the Federal Environmental Foundation's 
financial base is also a top priority. So far its financial 
capabilities are limited by the fact that some of the 
territorial environmental foundations have not been reallocating 
it the 10 percent deductions stipulated by law. In 1992 there 
were 24 such foundations (the foundations of 12 republics in the 
Russian Federation, six national okrugs and six oblasts). This 
year the environmental foundations of the following republics 
continue to evade the reallocation of monies to the Federal 
Environmental Foundation: Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, 
Kalmykia-Khalm Tangch and Dagestan; the Kabardino-Balkar, 
Karachayevo-Cherkess and Chechen krays; and Krasnodar, Maritime, 
Voloda, Sverdlovsk, Irkutsk and Sakhalin oblasts. 
  In order to expand the financial capabilities of the 
nonbudgetary environmental foundations' system, it would be a 
good idea to establish an Environmental Bank. The establishment 
the foundation projects of a Center for Business Cooperation in 
the Area of Environmental Protection would contribute to the 
concentration of information on the latest equipment and 
technologies, and to the improvement of publishing activities in 
the field of environmental protection.

<F P=106> [Article by A. V. Yablokov: ``Five Aspects of the No. 1 </F>
Problem''; based on his speech at the plenary session of the 
international seminar ``Radioactive Waste: Assessing Its Risk, 
Minimizing Its Formation, and Processing and Storing It,'' held 
in Moscow 13-17 September 1993] 
  [Text] The consistent results of the analysis of the 
country's environmental situation over the past three years 
indicate that the country's radioactive contamination is the 
environmental ``No. 1 problem'' for Russia. 
  ``The peasant doesn't cross himself until the thunder 
sounds.'' And so, that problem has become plainly urgent only 
today, when the consequences of the impact of radiation, which 
has no taste, color or smell, have become clear. Consequences 
that manifest themselves, to a considerable extent, not right 
away, and sometimes only after generations. 
  Radiation has played a dirty joke on humanity, which to this 
day has not listened to the ominous warnings of specialists. Did 
humanity listen to the warnings of Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadskiy 
that were made back in the 1920s? Or to the warnings voiced by 
Curie, Sakharov and many other of the most highly qualified 
professionals dealing with radiation? 
  And what about the impenetrable system of general secrecy 
that for decades surrounded former Soviet and now Russian 
nuclear-radiation problems (and still surrounds them, albeit 
granted, to a lesser degree)? After all, even in 1988-1989, 
three years after the proclamation (our 
emphasis--Eds.) of glasnost, orders were being issued making the 
consequences and details of the Chernobyl disaster secret, and 
even directly forbidding physicians (in violation of their 
Hippocratic Oath) to establish a connection between illnesses 
and radiation injury. Even this year, just several months ago, 
the Ministry of Atomic Energy (in my opinion, in circumvention 
of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources, or in any event, in direct contradiction to existing 
legislation on access to environmental information) managed to 
persuade the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to adopt a special 
decree blocking the declassification of its past departmental 
documents. Can this possibly enhance our national security? I am 
afraid that just the opposite is true. 
  It is fundamentally clear that radiation contamination in 
Russia is the No. 1 form of pollution. Chernobyl fallout covers 
thousands of square kilometers, of which many have been taken 
out of economic use for a long time to come. 
  Vast territories have been contaminated or subject to 
contamination in the Southern Urals as a result of a number of 
radiation accidents and the discharge of highly radioactive 
effluent into the Tobol basin. Radiation has also scorched 
Russian lands adjoining the Altay with the Semipalatinsk proving 
ground. The Novaya Zemlya proving ground is a major source of 
radioactive contamination on a Russian-wide scale. The results 
of the long-past above-ground and atmospheric tests there will 
be felt for a long time still to come through the biological 
accumulation of radionuclides in the North's ecosystems. 
  And what about the contamination of the Yenisey over a range 
of hundreds, possibly thousands of kilometers as a result of the 
production of weapons-grade plutonium at Krasnoyarsk-26? Or the 
contamination of the underground environment as a result of the 
pumping of liquid radioactive waste into it at Krasnoyarsk-26 
and Tomsk-7? Or the nearly 100 underground nuclear explosions 
``for peaceful purposes'' that have left radioactive pockmarks 
across practically the whole country? 
  But all this contamination may seem a trifle in comparison 
to 
the daily, already familiar radiation danger that we face from 
the hundreds of thousands of instruments containing radioactive 
isotopes and are used with sometimes criminal carelessness; from 
the ``background-radiating'' urban developments where the walls 
of many buildings have been made, like those in Omsk; out of 
radioactive crushed stone, from radioactive roads, the beds of 
which contain radioactive crushed stone and slag; from unmarked 
former radiation graveyards; from the numerous dumps on the 
sites of the former processing of uranium and thorium ores; or 
from the insufficiently responsible attitude toward the use of 
radiation technologies in medicine, science and technology? 
  In the past decade, more than 600 sites of radioactive 
contamination were found and eliminated on the territory of 
Moscow. But that is not reassuring, since another 50-60 such 
places are found here every year, and by no means all of 
Moscow's territory has been adequately studied in this respect. 
Moreover, even in the largest cities, the existing monitoring of 
radioactive contamination is incapable of rapidly giving us 
comprehensive and objective data. 
  Numerous problems of the country's radioactive contamination 
are connected with radioactive waste in the broad meaning of the 
term. And without ``teaching the scientists'' who are 
professionally concerned with the problems of radioactive waste, 
let me note for them and a broad circle of ZELENYY MIR's 
readers--from the viewpoint of an ecologist and a 
politician--just a few aspects of the problem that are, as a 
rule, considered either extremely rarely or merely in passing, 
and then only by specialists. 
  First of all, a word about the professional responsibility 
of 
scientists connected with the nuclear industry. How could they 
have developed for the economy technologies that did not wind up 
with, figuratively speaking, the ``cleaning up of the work 
place''--elimination of the radioactive contamination, which 
(they knew!) inevitably accompanies the technologies they 
developed? When the active construction of nuclear power plants 
began in our country and abroad, specialists essentially brushed 
off the question of the problems of radioactive waste: ``Don't 
prevent us from working for the good of civilization; the 
questions of radioactive waste will be solved in the next few 
years!'' Several decades have passed, and where is that 
fundamental solution? Vitrifying radioactive wastes or hardening 
them with bitumen or cement, or pumping them under the ground, 
or discharging them into the world's oceans cannot be considered 
such a solution. Larger and larger territories are having to be 
set aside for radiation graveyards. It now appears that we 
intend to shift the solution of the problem of radioactive waste 
onto the shoulders of future generations. 
  Why have specialists only now started talking seriously 
about 
plans to dismantle and take out of service nuclear power plants 
that have outlived their normal lifetimes? Can it be that 40 
years ago developers did not know that the lifetime of power 
stations was limited? They knew, but they did not show the least 
concern for preparing plans for rehabilitating the environment 
following their operation. 
  The second aspect of the ``No. 1 problem'' is closely 
connected with the first and also rarely discussed by 
specialists--it is the problem of public trust. 
  Our nuclear-industry leaders repeatedly talked about the 
absolute safety of the RBMK [uranium-graphite channel-type] 
reactor. And perhaps only Academician A. P. Aleksandrov has 
publicly repented for what he did, speaking at a general meeting 
of the USSR Academy of Sciences. And what about the rest of the 
general and head designers and other persons who made the 
extremely dangerous decisions that resulted in many billions' 
(of dollars) worth of losses and the ruined health of thousands 
of our fellow citizens? 
  I speak of the need to repent because only that can result 
in 
the CLEANSING, after which TRUST can come. 
There will be no TRUST without REPENTANCE 
and the admission of MISTAKES. Incidentally, the 
precise determination of the causes of the emergence of the 
problem of radioactive waste, which is closely bound up with the 
admission of past mistakes in the nuclear and radiation 
technologies that were developed, would also be of great help in 
choosing courses of effective action today. Without public 
trust, the development of the nuclear industry will be made more 
difficult or will be altogether impossible, no matter what 
decisions the Council of Minsters takes. 
  At present the Ministry of Atomic Energy is giving a lot of 
attention to restoring public trust: in the form of colorful 
booklets on nuclear power plants, the establishment of 
public-relations units, and an active campaign in the press. But 
all that is not enough, because the society is not hearing 
penitence, or repentance, or the open and honest analysis of 
mistakes from them. 
  Is it possible that anyone seriously thinks that the 
questions of building interregional radiation graveyards on 
Novaya Zemlya or the Kola Peninsula, or the question of building 
a storage facility for the plutonium from dismantled nuclear 
warheads can be solved at this time in the quiet of Moscow 
offices? Glasnost with regard to plans, a respectful and 
constructive dialogue with citizens who think differently than 
the developers of nuclear technologies--that is the only way to 
overcome the distrust of society. 
  The third aspect of these reflections concerns the 
legitimacy 
of actions. We dream of living in a rule-of-law state and are 
trying to build one as soon as possible, but in our practical 
activities we shamelessly ignore or violate the laws. 
  The law has determined (whether this is good or bad, it has 
determined) that radioactive materials may not be shipped in 
from abroad, that radioactive waste may not be discharged into 
the sea, and that radioactive waste may not be disposed of in 
space. The first and second provisions are constantly violated, 
and serious discussions are constantly being held about 
violating the third--conferences are held and resolutions are 
adopted. What are, for all intents and purposes 
CRIMINAL activities are openly planned and carried 
out! Think about it, you nuclear specialists, so that later some 
of you will not end up in the defendant's dock. 
  A law on the handling of radioactive waste has already 
passed 
on first reading in the Supreme Soviet. It is distressing to 
realize that it is only the first legislative act specially 
regulating radiation safety. Our nuclear specialists, who very 
vigorously emphasize their complete observance of all the 
recommendations of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency], have for some reason failed to follow a single one of 
the IAEA's main recommendations to any state planning the use of 
nuclear energy--BEFORE building nuclear power plants 
and introducing nuclear technologies, ADOPT NATIONAL 
LEGISLATION! Let's be candid: Unquestionably, the absence 
of such legislation and adherence only to semisecret or 
completely secret departmental instructions, going splendidly 
hand in hand with the aforementioned secrecy, which sometimes 
even now assumes paranoid forms, were advantageous to many 
people. 
  The fourth aspect of the problem, which is also of great 
practical importance, is overcoming the departmental syndrome, 
which can be briefly formulated as follows: ``The interests of 
the department come first.'' 
  It has developed historically that the Ministry of Atomic 
Energy is a kind of state within a state, a supermonopoly in 
many spheres of the use of nuclear energy. And according to the 
classical laws of state bureaucracy, any department acts first 
and foremost in its own interests. But the interests of such an 
immense department as the Ministry of Atomic Energy may 
dangerously diverge from the interests of the state and society. 
For example, there exists a new, unusual method of hardening 
liquid wastes that is several times as effective as and less 
costly than the existing methods for vitrifying them or 
hardening them with bitumen or cement; it was developed outside 
the Ministry of Atomic Energy by a group of ``solar'' scientists 
and practitioners from Berezniki. The need to more rapidly and 
efficiently cleanse the country's territory of radioactive waste 
would seem to be obvious (given the colossal budget deficit), as 
would the necessity of promptly checking out that proposal, and 
if its effectiveness is confirmed, shifting to that method. But 
that is apparently not the case: for a year the inventors have 
been asking the Ministry of Atomic Energy to conduct an expert 
review of their studies and proposals! 
  It will be difficult to overcome the Ministry of Atomic 
Energy's dangerous departmental syndrome, but it is essential to 
do so. And in solving the problem of radioactive waste, a good 
possibility for that already exists. The draft State Program on 
Radioactive Waste that spent several years wandering the 
hallways is reaching the home stretch--it is being considered in 
the government and will be handed over for approval by the 
legislative branch. So let us try to open financing for that 
program on a competitive basis, and not according to the 
directives of the Ministry of Atomic Energy. Experience in 
developing and operating such nondepartmental specialized funds 
has been fairly well developed in the world--it can and should 
simply be borrowed. 
  The fifth aspect is the acceptability of the risk of any 
given technology for society and the state. We in Russia have 
lagged seriously behind many industrially developed countries of 
the world in developing the whole concept of risk and safety, 
and its central component--the concept of acceptable risk. At 
present, unfortunately, many people find this risk absolutely 
unacceptable in practically all the main areas of the nuclear 
industry. Therefore, it should be no surprise that the 
development of the branch has turned out to be unstable. 
  The Interdepartmental Commission for Environmental Safety 
that was recently established as an agency of the Russian 
Federation Security Council has decided to consider, among its 
top-priority problems, various aspects of environmental danger 
associated with solving the problem of radioactive wastes in the 
country. And as chairman of that commission, I make the 
following request to all qualified specialists, of which there 
are a good many among the readers of ZELENYY MIR: formulate and 
convey through the editors proposals that may subsequently be 
discussed in the commission and the Security Council in order 
that specific managerial solutions in this area that is of vital 
importance for the state, society and each one of us may be 
proposed to the president and the government.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Sotnikova: ``Concept Prepared for </F>
Protection of Populace From Radiation''] 
  [Text] In connection with the intensive radioactive 
contamination of the local area in a number of regions of 
Russia, by direction of Boris Yeltsin, work began in 1992 on a 
``Concept for Protection of the Population and Economic Activity 
on Territories Subjected to Radioactive Contamination.'' 
Yesterday, at a ``round table'' at the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources, its draft was introduced for 
discussion by specialists. 
  The document, prepared by staff members at the Institute for 
Radiation Hygiene of Russia, formulates scientific principles 
and basic methods for practical implementation of measures for 
protecting the populace on territories contaminated by 
radionuclides. 
  The principal aim of these measures is to protect the health 
of the populace. And the way to achieve this is--reducing the 
level of irradiation [obluchenie] from all basic sources of 
radiation [izluchenie] (based on the principle of optimization), 
medical protection, an increased level of radiation-hygienic 
knowledge, psychological protection of the people, and 
increasing their social and legal defense. Also defined in the 
draft are principles of economic activity on these territories 
after a long period of time has elapsed since their 
contamination. 
  Except for the section on gradation of contamination levels 
the remaining constituent parts of the concept raised no 
disagreement. The basis for gradation was a new scale developed 
by the authors of the document for evaluating the radioactive 
contamination of territories, which divides the territory into 
three zones--a radiation defense zone, a voluntary evacuation 
zone, and an exclusion zone. 
  The optimal indicator of radiation level in Russia, as in 
the 
countries of Europe, is acknowledged to be a dose of radiation 
[radiatsiya] of one mZv [presumably, ``milliZievert''] (a Zivert 
[named for Swedish scientist G.R. Siewert] is a measure of the 
cumulative effect of chronic irradiation of a human being in 
small doses). The maximum allowable dose of radiation incurred 
when carrying out certain protective and preventive measures is 
considered to be five mZv. But according to estimates by the 
primary opponent--the Socio-Ecological Union--this indicator 
should be significantly reduced; and, in its opinion, the 
lowering of radiation stress should be encouraged as well. 
According to analysis by the round-table participants, one 
cannot orient oneself on Europe in questions of defense against 
radioactive contamination: its level in Russia is incomparable 
higher. Thus, it is highly likely that the levels of radiation 
safety in the program of the Russian government will be greatly 
reduced in comparison with that of civilized countries. 
<H5>  Recommendations for Residents of a Contaminated Area </H5>
  1. Every person who lives in a radioactive contamination 
zone 
has the right to know their received and projected irradiation 
dose. 
  2. One must take into consideration not only the benefit, 
but 
also the harm from defensive measures connected with changing 
one's way of life. Therefore, a person must take the basic 
decisions independently. The decision to dwell on contaminated 
territories in terms of the amount of risk is comparable with 
other decisions in life. For example, smoking presents a much 
greater risk to one's health, to include oncological diseases, 
than living in a radiation monitoring zone. 
  3. One should not strive to limit one's food intake 
groundlessly; an insufficient or unbalanced diet can lead to 
reduction of one's anti-tumoral and anti-infection immunity. One 
must regularly include vegetables and fruits in one's diet, and 
water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins are effective means of 
prevention of tumoral diseases and the consequences of 
irradiation. 
  4. One need not limit one's time in the fresh air, nor 
swimming in reservoirs--limiting one's mobility is very harmful. 
  5. A state of constant psycho-emotional pressure (stress), 
often caused by highly exaggerated fear of radiation, is an 
enormous threat to the health of the populace living on 
contaminated territories.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Bayduzhiy: ``A Martyrology of the </F>
Ecology''] 
  [Text] Another white paper has been published--the State 
Report on the Condition of the Environment in the Russian 
Federation in 1992. Whereas the first such publication a year 
ago appeared before the public in conjunction with a report on 
the state of health of the populace, this time the ecologists 
have stolen a march on the medical profession, whose ministry is 
only now finishing ``its own'' white paper, while at the same 
time urgently seeking the means to publish it. Last year's and 
this year's publication of state reports have yet another 
difference in circumstances. Whereas the promulgation of the 
first of them in 1992 became a minor sensation--an event 
signifying the transition from the epoch of a taboo on 
ecological information, to the common practice of civilized 
countries--the circumstances of the appearance of this year's 
report bore the marks of a more commonplace, working matter; but 
it is precisely this that signifies that openness in the realm 
of the ecology is no longer the exception, but the norm of the 
official policy of Russia at all levels. 
  As RF Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources Viktor Danilov-Danilyan wrote in the foreword to the 
book, ``The condition of the environment in the Russian 
Federation remains on the whole unsatisfactory.'' And although 
for the majority of Russians who live in zones of ecological 
catastrophe this truth is understood even without a white paper, 
the paper provides a wealth of statistical material which 
permits confirming this truth in concrete examples. One of the 
most vivid is the fact that the slump in industrial production, 
which last year was in excess of 18 percent, contrary to the 
expectation of optimists did not cause a commensurate decline in 
the volume of pollution of the environment. Discharges of 
harmful substances into the atmosphere during that same time 
declined in all by 11.8 percent; and while the hydrologic intake 
from natural sources declined by 5.4 percent, the discharge of 
polluted waste water declined by only 9.4 percent. Nearly a 
third of the population of the country was subjected to the 
influence of one harmful substance or another last year, in 
amounts exceeding the allowable concentration by a factor of ten 
or more, and nearly 20 percent live in conditions of 
continuously high levels of pollution of the ambient air by 
several harmful substances. 
  Without a doubt the strong point of the white paper, as 
typical of such documents, is its systematic nature. Without 
reporting anything principally new--the majority of the data 
entered into it was known among specialists before this; 
nevertheless, having assembled and broken the data down into its 
component parts, it provides quite a complete picture of the 
ecological crisis in Russia. It is also of no little importance 
that the creators of the document did not limit themselves to 
merely saturating it with ``raw'' data, but strove to apply 
analysis to the report, introducing sections which examine in 
detail the causes for the current unfavorable condition of the 
environment; prognoses for further development of the situation 
in this sphere; recommendations for the future; and, analysis of 
the effects on the ecological situation of various factors in 
the economic, political and social life of the country. It is 
precisely owing to their systematic nature that the first and 
the now-published second state report, that they have done what 
the ecological society had talked about for so long: the empty 
spaces in the mass of data on the state of the environment have 
indeed been put on the map, and not in the form of seas in which 
the islands of reliable information may founder. The last area 
in which such gaps existed for the general public at least, and 
there still are quite a few, remains the radioactive 
contamination of Russia and the consequences of the operation of 
various atomic sites and their products on its territory. A 
report of a State Commission on Radioactive Contamination of the 
Seas and Oceans Contiguous to the USSR and Russia, which was 
made public in April of last year, having made public disclosure 
of the unfavorable condition in our environment, according to 
the law of contrast only stressed the lack of information on 
similar contamination of the dry land, which poses a much 
greater threat to the population of Russia. Thus, the compilers 
of the present state report have their work cut out for them, 
and in the next white paper published they might propose 
significantly expanding the section devoted to radioactive 
contamination of the country. And in consideration of the 
critical nature of this problem and the interest in it in the 
regions, it could even be issued as a separate document. 
  And finally, the last item. In the chapter devoted to 
shedding light on ecological problems by the mass information 
media, quite unexpectedly NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA turned up on the 
list of newspapers who do this inadequately. While understanding 
and respecting the wishes of the authors of the report to see 
our pages 100 percent filled with materials on ecological 
topics, we cannot of course consent to this--if only because of 
the fact that the first of the Russian mass information media 
to acquaint its readers with the contents of the white paper on 
the ecology which came out in 1992, as was the case with the 
report of the governmental commission on pinpointing the 
locations where radioactive wastes are buried in the seas, was 
in fact--NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. 
  The circulation of the state report consists of 500 copies 
and is addressed to specialists only. However, according to 
preliminary information, the newspaper ZELENIY MIR [Green World] 
plans to publish this document along with other official 
documents on the ecology, and sell them as a supplement to the 
newspaper. One would hope that they would then reach a much 
wider circle of readers, indeed as many as possible.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Grudinina: ``Man Is Successfully Competing </F>
With Nature--Judging by the Number of Catastrophes He Has 
Caused''] 
  [Text] The destructive effects of the modern technosphere 
on the environment can only be compared with the aftermath of 
natural cataclysms. Such a conclusion inevitably arises when one 
reads, ``A Handbook on Urgent Measures for Reducing the 
Ecological Risk from Technogeneous Accidents and Catastrophes,'' 
prepared by the RF Federal Mining and Industrial Inspectorate 
for a session of the RF Interdepartmental Commission on 
Ecological Safety. 
  The development of industrial production, particularly the 
most dangerous ones--the chemical and petrochemical, the oil and 
gas-refining sectors, and the mining and metallurgical 
complex--in and of itself already increases the risk of 
technogeneous accidents. What with the existing technical 
equipment at the majority of our enterprises, the danger 
increases manyfold. In 1992 there were 430 accidents at 
production facilities and sites monitored by Gosgortekhnadzor 
[probably, State Committee for Technical Oversight of the Mining 
Industry], the material losses from which amount to nearly R2 
billion. Twelve train wrecks and 1,020 other incidents occurred 
during rail shipment of hazardous materials, in the course of 
which there were 817 cases of leakage of petroleum products, 
chemicals, and other toxic substances. In the first half of 
1993, 196 accidents took place, with material losses amounting 
to nearly R1.6 billion. 
  The causes are the commonly-known and traditional ones. The 
level of scientific research on industrial safety is inadequate 
to the demands of the present, which has a significant effect on 
the quality of design and planning work, and retards the 
redesign of systems for insuring stable, accident-free 
industrial production facilities. The grossest violations of 
safety requirements result from deviations from modern 
technology, and improper engineering decisions. The obsolesence 
of fixed capital at enterprises in the chemical complex, for 
example, amounts to 70-75 percent (having been in operation for 
20 years and more). And finally, the very practice of financing 
environmental-protection measures out of ecological funds. 
According to data from Mintopenergo Rossii [RF Ministry of Fuel 
and Energy], in 1992 only 25 percent of the funds were expended 
as directed. 
  In major industrial regions--Angarsk, Kemerovo, Ufa, 
Dzerzhinsk--an enormous amount of highly-toxic substances are 
piling up--cholrine, ammonia, hydrocyanic [prussic] acid. In the 
event of the development of a chain of accidents at such 
enterprises, the scale of the consequences is hard to imagine. 
Fires, explosions, and discharges of toxic products are 
increasingly the causes of people perishing. In the last year 
alone, at sites of the chemical complex, there were 82 accidents 
involving the destruction of production facilities and 
significant discharges of harmful substances. Material losses 
from these accidents amounted to R55.7 million. 
  In the first eight months of this year 24 accidents took 
place. The handbook cites examples of the major ones. In 1992, 
at the Bratsk Chlorine Plant, as a result of loss of hermetic 
sealing on a condenser shell, chlorine was discharged into the 
atmosphere for 16 minutes, and it became necessary to evacuate 
the personnel at two neighboring enterprises. An investigation 
established that the enterprises had not resolved questions of 
accidental release of gases. An especially dangerous situation 
came to pass at enterprises in Irkutsk Oblast. In 1990 alone, 50 
accidental discharges took place for which emergency gas rescue 
equipment was employed. 
  Enterprises for extraction of minerals and the exploitation 
of mineral resources are exceedingly dangerous to the 
environment. Here it is necessary to solve the most complex 
problems with respect to engineering. Pumping wastes deep 
underground and discharge of waste waters--sooner or later turn 
out to be time-bombs. Special threats are posed by landslides, 
sudden destruction of the sides of quarries and dumps, and the 
destruction of rock faces. Carrying on underground mining 
operations beneath water-bearing strata poses significant risk, 
and protecting mines from flooding is an almost unsolvable 
problem. For instance, beneath the cities of Berezniki and 
Solikamsk, after many years of mining operations, 170 million 
cubic meters of empty space has been formed; in the event these 
spaces were to be accidentally flooded, the catastrophic results 
would be hard to predict. There has already been one such 
instance in the history of our potassium industry. In 1986 at 
the Verkhnekamsk deposit, a mine with a capacity of 7.6 million 
tons per year was flooded. Losses subsequently amounted to over 
R300 million. 
  The working group which prepared ``A Handbook on Urgent 
Measures for Reducing the Ecological Risk from Technogeneous 
Accidents and Catastrophes,'' proposes a number of measures 
which, in its opinion, would permit stabilizing the situation in 
the next two-to-three years. Apart from the stereotypical 
``intensification of criminal, administrative and economic 
liability,'' it proposes developing a concept for a ``National 
Policy of the Russian Federation in the Sphere of Technogeneous 
and Economic Danger,'' and also other draft laws which establish 
the legal basis for industrial and ecological safety. 
  In addition, state oversight organs have taken special pains 
to point out the following circumstance: Under conditions of 
changing the forms of property, and the transfer of 
responsibility from the level of ministries and departments to 
the level of associations, corporations and concerns, the latter 
do not envisage or do not attribute the proper significance to 
the functions of managing ecological and industrial safety. Some 
entrepreneurs and enterprise managers are reducing or entirely 
eliminating the corresponding services, and are using the assets 
thus freed up as reserves for reducing expenditures and 
guaranteeing immediate profits. Thus, Gosnadzor RF [RF State 
Committee on Oversight] certifies that the economic mechanisms 
of today do not permit employing economic levers and stimuli to 
ensure production safety. 
  It only remains to point out the fact that over the course 
of 
the many decades of the Soviet period a ruinous ecological 
policy was pursued, in the absence of any new economic 
conditions. Moreover, many joint stock companies and 
associations are--yesterday's ministries and departments, as a 
rule with the previous leadership intact, and consequently the 
former level of thinking.

  [Text] The results have been summed up of two years' work 
on a program for the comprehensive inspection of the water route 
of the Moscow River within the city's boundaries. After 
receiving the results of the analysis of the water and its 
inhabitants, researchers have recognized the Moscow River to be 
dangerous to life. 
  [Correspondent Yevgeniy Pogorelova, over video showing 
Moscow River] What is the Moscow River? A port for five 
seas on tourist postcards or a huge garbage dump with 18 million 
cubic meters of toxic waste on its bottom? 
  [Video shows map of river] On this map of the 
Moscow River, the sections marked in red and yellow are 
dangerous or extremely dangerous zones where permissible norms 
of contents of salts of heavy metals and toxic substances have 
been exceeded by hundreds of times. Iron, lead, and arsenic 
have been discovered in the silt on the bed of the river in the 
area of the Kremlin, the Yauza estuary, Setun and Skhodnya. The 
contents of mercury in the river downstream of ZIL [Moscow's 
major motor works] exceeds all permissible norms by 250 times. 
  [Video shows samples of fish caught in the river] 
This is fish that lives in the river -- monsters with 
irreversible genetic changes, without fins and scales, 
goggle-eyed, and with cancer tumors. According to 
ichthyologists from the Moscow State University and the 
Institute of Evolutionary Morphology of the Academy of Sciences, 
the process of mutation takes several years with fish and 
several decades with human beings. The laboratory assistants 
who are conducting research into mutants' internal organs have 
received grave poisoning. The latest research has shown 
radioactive elements in the water in the area of Strogino. The 
Moscow River is turning into a dead reservoir and everyone who 
comes into contact with it is being subjected to the danger of 
mutation and cancer.

  [Text] [060810] [Klepov over video of small stream 
followed by Permnefteorgsintez oil refinery installations] 
Not so long ago this stream, the Pysh, used to be aflame. Oil 
refinery waste flowed into it and was set alight to prevent it 
from reaching the Kama river. There was even a special position 
for this purpose, whose holder was described as the 
``incendiary.'' With the commissioning of pumping stations the 
situation has changed. Now there are fish in the stream. 
  Air pollution monitoring has been stepped up. Discharges of 
noxious chemicals into the atmosphere have been halved in recent 
years. Sudden blowouts are a thing of the past. Hothouses 
where flowers are grown have appeared literally under the 
flares. The air in the production units is much cleaner now. 
Modern production lines are being introduced here. An 
automated motor oil and solvent packaging line is in operation. 
Russia's first line packaging bitumen for the construction 
industry has just gone into operation. The Association is 
unstinting with hard currency earned from the sale of its output 
when it comes to retooling and modernization. All this helps to 
increase production efficiency and improve the ecological 
situation. 
  Nonetheless, many problems remain. Noxious discharges into 
the atmosphere have not yet been reduced to the permissible 
limit; substantial amounts of petrochemicals still collect in 
the soil; not all the waste is yet being recycled. All these 
issues are being addressed by the collective in cooperation with 
scientists and health and hygiene service staff. Great hopes 
are being pinned on the modernization of the enterprise. A 
decision to this effect has been taken by the Russian 
Government. [060940] [video shows detailed views of

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``Russian State Committee for </F>
Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision Concerned Over 
Children's Health'' -- from the ``Retsept'' section p i] 
  [Text] The Russian State Committee for Sanitary and 
Epidemiological Supervision [Gossanepidnadzor] has expressed 
extreme concern over the state of health of Russians, especially 
children. In the words of Gossanepidnadzor Chairman Yevgeniy 
Belyayev, in the first nine months of this year the number of 
cases of measles in Russia has increased by 320 percent in 
comparison with the same period of last year, cases of whooping 
cough by 29 percent, and cases of epidemic parotitis by 31 
percent. 
  There were 10 outbreaks of dysentry, abdominal typhoid, 
hepatitis, and salmonella recorded in the country in 1993, as a 
result of which around 7,000 people fell ill. Diphtheria has 
reached epidemic proportions: The number of people suffering 
from this infection has reached 5,000; around 300 have died, 
including 50 children. 
  This situation, in Yevgeniy Belyayev's opinion, has been 
brought about by the unsatisfactory state of the environment, a 
reduction in the immunity levels of Russians, the low level of 
inoculation among adults and children, and a shortage of 
vitamins and preventive medicines. According to the information 
of the ``Kedr'' constructive ecological movement, which actively 
cooperates with the country's sanitary and epidemiological 
services, around 60 million Russian citizens today live in 
conditions permanently exceeding the maximum permissible 
concentrations of noxious substances. Levels of atmospheric 
pollution exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations by a 
factor of 10 are periodically registered in more than 80 cities 
and industrial centers. Around 28 cubic km of contaminated 
effluent are discharged into Russia's water reservoirs each 
year, of which 8.4 cubic km have not been purified. Highly 
toxic organic compounds, heavy metal salts, phenols, and 
petroleum products are discovered in water sources. 
  In the words of Anatoliy Panfilov, chairman of the ``Kedr'' 
movement, the threat to the health of the population, above all 
to children, has prompted the movement's members to put forward 
an initiative on purchasing abroad a large quantity of medical 
preparations to boost immunity, as well as equipment to produce 
them in Russia. After acquiring the necessary medicines, the 
Gossanepidnadzor specialists, in conjunction with activists of 
the ``Kedr'' movement, will deliver them to citizens most in 
need of them in the unfortunate regions.

the (Imandra) floating technical base, to which nuclear fuel was 
being delivered at the time. 
  The commission had no serious complaints about the work of 
the enterprise's personnel. Its main conclusion coincided with 
the opinion of experts of the Russian-Norwegian expedition which 
studied radioactive pollution in the northern seas. A year ago 
they visited the technological repair yard of the nuclear 
ice-breaker fleet and also reached the conclusion that the 
system of ensuring nuclear and radioactive control there 
corresponds to all requirements and norms of radioactive safety.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: ``Seconds Away From Nuclear </F>
Accident''--first paragraph is AFTENPOSTEN introduction] 
  [Text] The near accident at the nuclear power plant at Kola 
in February did not surprise Russian authorities: The KGB warned 
of the danger of an accident in July of last year. 
  This can be seen in a letter written by Deputy Minister N. 
Gulushko of the Russian Ministry of Safety to the Russian 
Government addressed to then Deputy Prime Minister Chernomyrdin 
in July 1992. The environmental foundation Bellona was recently 
given a copy of the letter while on a visit to Moscow. 
  It says in the letter that half of Russia's nuclear power 
plants have such serious structural faults and such a poorly 
trained staff that they constitute a large threat. In the letter 
the Ministry of Safety is focusing in particular on the poor or 
completely nonexisting safety training of the employees at the 
nuclear power plants. According to the letter the internal 
safety training is wretched. Further it has been pointed out 
that internal unrest resulting from quarrels over wages at the 
nuclear power plants leads to a further reduction in the level 
of safety at the plants. The Kola plant is one of the plants 
that the Ministry of Safety uses as an example of this. 
  Thomas Nilsen from Bellona visited Kola two days ago: ``For 
the past two weeks there has been renewed unrest at the Kola 
nuclear power plant. The plant is not paid for the power it 
delivers to heavy industry. This has resulted in the workers not 
receiving their pay. When the plant's director protested and 
threatened to shut down the reactors, he was fired by the 
Ministry of Nuclear Power, which however quickly withdrew the 
dismissal when the director was supported by the employees,'' 
Nilsen says, pointing out that such lasting administrative chaos 
contributes to reduced safety. 
  ``Unrest concerning wages, etc., comes on top of already 
poor 
safety caused by a lack of professional understanding for what 
they are really doing, a lack of training in safety measures, 
and also the physical structural faults of the plant. I am 
convinced that on the day that a real accident happens at the 
Kola plant, it will be caused by operator error,'' Nilsen says. 
  An inspection team from the International Atomic Energy 
Association (IAEA) has recently visited the plant, and the 
leader of the inspection team, the Japanese Van Lee Zong, said 
to the paper NORDLYS that the near accident during the night of 
2 February this year could have been a new Chernobyl catastrophe 
with a reactor core meltdown. During his visit to Kola, the 
inspector told local journalists that the reactor core was only 
seconds away from a meltdown--and not minutes, as the public has 
been informed. 
  When the hurricane that raged over Kola the night of 1 
February caused a break in the power supply to the nuclear power 
plant, a long time passed before the operators were able to 
start one of the emergency generators and add cooling water for 
the two reactors. Without cooling water the reactor core would 
have suffered a meltdown. 
  Inspector Van Lee Zong from the IAEA says that the near 
accident in February was caused by operator error. They were 
faced by a situation they had never been trained to handle, he 
says. IAEA has previously characterized the Kola plant as one of 
the 10 worst in the world. Van Lee Zong says, however, that from 
a purely technical point of view, the plant is not so bad today, 
among other things because the leadership has carried through 
some of the proposals for improvement submitted by the IAEA. But 
the personnel failed, and as Van Lee Zong says: ``I have never 
heard of such a dramatic episode.'' 
  The near accident in February is the most serious known near 
accident in any nuclear power plant. On 27 May this year there 
was also an accident at the Kola plant when a valve in the 
reactor's cooling cycle broke. The reactors had to be shut down 
again.

introduction] 
  [Text] Important Norwegian safety equipment is finally in 
place at the nuclear power plant at Kola. 
  Murmansk--For more than three months Norwegian authorities 
have worked to get this equipment cleared through Russian 
customs. Russia has demanded an importation fee and value-added 
tax on the equipment, which is a gift from Norway. 
  The problem was solved when Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Johan 
Jorgen Holst last week got in touch with the head of the Russian 
Ministry of Nuclear Affairs, Viktor Mikhailov. The equipment has 
now been delivered to the nuclear power plant duty free. 
  Director Knut Gussgard at the National Radiation Protection 
Board says that this decision is important for nuclear safety 
work. 
  ``The customs problems almost put a halt to the entire 
Norwegian-Russian work to improve safety at the nuclear power 
plant at Polyarny Sori, which is not up to Western standards in 
several areas,'' he says. 
  The Kola power plant, which opened in 1973, has four 
reactors. Two of these are of the same type as those at the 
nuclear power plant in Greifswald in the former East Germany. 
The Greifswald plant has been closed for safety reasons. 
<H5>  New Million [Kroner] Gift </H5>
  The National Radiation Protection Board did not want to 
continue with the work of improving safety conditions at Kola 
until the first shipment of maintenance equipment and batteries 
were in place. 
  ``Since the problem now has been solved, we will order an 
emergency generator unit worth 10 million kroner. If everything 
goes according to plan, the unit will be installed at the power 
plant just after the new year,'' Gussgard says. 
  The National Radiation Protection Board realized a long time 
ago that the emergency power supply was not good enough. A power 
failure at the nuclear power plant on 2 February clearly showed 
this. The reactor cores were then in danger of a meltdown. Only 
after two hours did the power plant manage to get the power 
supply up again. A catastrophe was probably averted. 
  The emergency power unit from Norway will prevent such a 
situation from arising again, according to the National 
Radiation Protection Board. 
<H5>  Customs Dispute </H5>
  Both the Russian Consulate at Kirkenes, the Norwegian 
Consulate in Murmansk, and the embassy in Moscow have worked to 
get the Norwegian equipment out to the power plant duty free. 
The head of the customs department in Murmansk thinks that the 
safety equipment is a form of emergency aid and therefore should 
be duty free. However, customs officials in Moscow demanded both 
an importation fee and value-added tax on the equipment. Tariff 
rates are high in Russia. All told tariffs and taxes on the 
Norwegian equipment would have amounted to almost half a million 
kroner. 
<H5>  High Priority </H5>
  The political advisor at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
Tore Gundersen, says that environmental problems in northwestern 
Russia have top priority in the cooperation in the Barents 
region, and that the solution of the customs problems is of 
importance for any further nuclear safety work. 
  ``We are planning to expand the aid package of 20 million 
kroner. But first we want to see the result of the first grant. 
It is important that the customs problems have been solved. We 
are prepared to grant additional millions for environmental work 
in the northwestern part of Russia,'' Gundersen says.

<F P=106> [Article by Ole Mathismoen: ``Kola Plant Will Be </F>
Rebuilt''--first paragraph is AFTENPOSTEN introduction] 
  [Text] Russian authorities and the leadership of the 
proprietary company have made up their minds: The nickel works 
at Kola is to be modernized. 
  This was announced at a meeting of the Norwegian/Russian 
environmental commission in Murmansk this week. The current 
round of bids will be closed within a short time. ``We were told 
that the work to modernize the plant would be started toward the 
end of 1994 or in the beginning of 1995,'' says State Secretary 
Borre Pettersen of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
  During the past year there has been speculation about 
whether 
the Russian authorities themselves, and not least the combine 
that owns the smelting works at Kola, would not prefer to close 
down the works rather than carry out a modernization that would 
cost about 4.5 billion kroner. A large portion of the ore that 
is being smelted at Kola is carried by rail from the north 
Siberian city of Norilsk, where the combine has other smelting 
works. Now, however, it looks like nickel ore will continue to 
be smelted at Kola. The ice-free harbor probably plays a 
decisive factor. 
<H5>  Norwegian Support </H5>
  Norwegian authorities made it clear during the meeting in 
Murmansk that the promise of environmental support of up to 300 
million kroner for the project is still valid, and that the aid 
is not dependent on giving any orders to the Norwegian company 
Elkem in connection with the modernization. 
  ``This is pure environmental support that eventually will be 
granted when we are given assurances that the emissions of 
sulphur and heavy metals are as low as we demand,'' Pettersen 
says. 
<H5>  Nuclear Storage </H5>
  At the Murmansk meeting Pettersen was informed that Russian 
authorities are now working more concretely than before on 
building a long-term storage facility for waste with low or 
intermediate levels of radioactivity. The plant will be located 
either at Novaya Semlya or east of the Kola peninsula. The 
Russians have responded positively to the Norwegian request to 
participate in the planning as an advisor. No promises were 
given as to Norwegian economic support for the building itself. 
  Because the dumping in the ocean of low-level radioactive 
liquid waste again has been on the agenda since the Japanese 
protested dumping in the Pacific, Pettersen raised the subject: 
``Russian environmental authorities did not inform us as to 
where they were dumping, how much, or anything like that. They 
stressed, however, that Russia aims to stop the dumping, but so 
far this is impossible because there are no storage facilities 
on land.'' 
<H5>  New Expedition </H5>
  Norway and Russia have agreed to carry through another 
research expedition to the Kara Sea next year in order to 
examine the Abrosimov Bay on the east side of Novaya Semlya. A 
common project will also be carried out in order to evaluate to 
what degree the nuclear plants in Mayak pose a risk for the 
northern areas from the river Ob. To be established under the 
commission is a subcommittee that will work with the ocean 
environment in the Barents region, write a report on the present 
conditions, make a list of priorities of things to be done, 
initiate new research, and coordinate current research. A 
training program in environmental technology for leaders and 
engineers in Russian industry will also be started. It was also 
agreed to continue working on plans to create a completely new 
system to coordinate environmental data in Russia. The long-term 
goal is to establish such a center in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Matveyeva: ``On the Brink of Military </F>
Conflict''] 
  [Text] In the autumn of 1991 thirty-nine Polish 
supertrawlers burst into the central part of the Sea of Okhotsk, 
a small ``pentagon'' of the neutral waters, 325 miles long and 
62 miles wide, surrounded from all sides by the marine economic 
zone of Russia. The Polish ships were followed by nine large 
South Korean trawlers and almost the entire Chinese fishing 
fleet. Somewhat later fishing ships from Japan, Panama, Bulgaria 
and Ukraine appeared. A wild revelry began in that part of the 
Sea of Okhotsk. Reluctant to observe the elementary 
international fishing regulations, foreign fishermen set to 
clearing out the wealth of the northern sea. 
  At first the Far Eastern fishermen, before whose eyes all 
this illegal activity occurred, accepted it as some absurd 
incident, without the slightest doubt that the Russian 
government and the President would put an end to the pilfering 
and the plunderers would be made to clear out shortly. In 
keeping with the moratorium on fishing in the central part of 
the Sea of Okhotsk, announced by the Supreme Soviet of the 
Russian Federation, local fishermen have stopped fishing and 
returned to their native port. However, our Supreme Soviet is 
not regarded as an authority by foreigners. 
  The poaching, unprecedented in world practice, has been 
going 
on for two years. Dozens of seiners (there were some months when 
they numbered 90) barbarously catch pollack in the area and 
everything that gets into the nets--herring, salmon, saury, 
flatfish, halibut, crabs and mollusks. Disregarding appeals and 
warnings from the Russian side (from fish-protection bodies and 
scientists) foreigners catch pollack in places which have always 
been regarded as forbidden areas, i.e., at the wintering 
congestions of this species and spawning grounds, undermining 
the existence of the pollack population. In fact, they take only 
the back of pollack used for ``Suremi'' stuffing and roe which 
makes 35 percent of the total catch. The rest is considered as 
waste and is thrown into the sea, which is now polluted beyond 
measure. According to experts, the foreign fleet catches 1.5 
million tons of pollack a year in the area. This is considerably 
more than permitted rates. The Sea of Okhotsk is doomed to 
ecological disaster, Far Eastern fishing companies will be 
ruined and fishermen will lose their jobs. 
  The neutral zone mentioned here covers only three percent of 
the total area and for numerous large-tonnage trawlers does not 
suffice. It is no wonder that now and again they find themselves 
in our economic zone, especially since boundaries cannot be 
drawn at sea. However, most of them pass into the prohibited 
zone intentionally. Well aware that Russia's economic zone is 
poorly guarded nowadays, and that our frontier-guard and fishing 
protection bodies face difficulties with fuel (patrol ships are 
laid up), they also raid Russian territorial waters. The 
poachers are rarely detained. But even those detained get off 
with a trifling fine, which fails to compensate the losses 
incurred by our country as a result of foreign poachers. 
According to the most optimistic calculations, Russia annually 
loses about $700 million because of raids by foreign fleets. 
  Russia's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly given explanations 
on this score from which it follows that there is no solution to 
the crisis in the Sea of Okhotsk, that the sea is unprotected 
and we have no rights to oppose the foreign plunderers. 
  But there are other seas in the world where, as in the Sea 
of 
Okhotsk, the zone allocated to international fishing is an 
insignificant part of the total area and is surrounded by the 
200-mile economic zone of the coastal state. 
  Controls imposed by the coastal states are very strict and 
serve to regulate foreign fishing in neutral waters. For 
law-breakers there are sanctions that can ruin even the most 
prosperous fishing companies. Violations of the law are rare 
there. 
  The situation on the Sea of Okhotsk has become strained to 
the utlmost. Insulted by the government's inaction and the 
impunity of robbers, Russia's fishermen are arming themselves. 
The frontier guards, too, suggest to change legislation and to 
give permission to open fire on poacher ships caught fishing in 
our waters. At its recent session the Council of the Far Eastern 
Association of Economic Cooperation offered to declare the area 
where foreign ships are deployed, a zone for launching ballistic 
missiles. It was also suggested that foreigners be turned out of 
the ``pentagon'' with the help of the Pacific Fleet warships, 
and only after that to find a juridical substantiation for these 
actions. Scientists recalled that in the past century there were 
similar problems with seal furs. The seal was on the brink of 
extinction. To prevent this Russia and the USA sent warships to 
the area to protect the environment from poachers. 
  P.S. The latest news: foreign warships began to enter the 
free zone to protect their ``fishermen.'' It looks as if the 
dramatic situation in the Sea of Okhotsk has reached its peak. 
The outcome is yet to be seen.

  [Text] Moscow's government has passed a programme of 
ecological measures in the city's power industry which will make 
it possible to lower atmospheric pollution in the capital 
considerably. 
  The implementation of the programme will make it possible to 
lower the emission of nitric oxides 2-2.5-fold, sulphur dioxide 
1.5-2-fold, oil products jointly with service water 8-10-fold, 
sulphates 5-6-fold, while virtually, eliminating suspended 
particles emissions, all by 2010. However, it is still unclear 
whether it will be at all possible to implement this scheme. The 
point is that nature-conserving undertakings are relatively 
capital intensive in the power industry. The cost of purifying 
installations in the West alone comes to 40 percent of the cost 
of the basic plant. The programme makes provision for the 
creation of a special-purpose section at the Moscow City 
Ecological Fund which will be busy accumulating funds to 
modernize the power industry. Energy producers insist on 
introducing increments on electricity and heating tariffs by 
approximately 1-3 percent. From the standpoint of consumers it 
would be fairer if producers were to deduct a certain sum for 
ecological measures from their payments for environmental 
pollution. 
  This year power industry workers have been able to collect 
1.5 billion roubles from different sources. On the other hand, 
four billion roubles will be required annually for the 
installation of catalytic nitrogen purification equipment for 
Moscow's thermoelectric plants alone. Unless serious investments 
in the programme have been found, Muscovites will have to 
continue to inhale polluted air even in the 21st century.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``A Majority of Russians Not Willing </F>
To Pay for a Clean Environment''] 
  [Text] The All-Russian Center for the Study of Public 
Opinion has conducted a poll of Russian citizens concerning 
their attitudes on environmental issues. Beset by financial, 
day-to-day and political cataclysms, our countrymen are not 
giving much thought to ecology, perhaps still believing that 
this is a problem only the state needs to worry about. 
  If one compares the opinion of people in different age 
groups, one find that the greatest willingness to make 
sacrifices in order to solve environmental problems is expressed 
by people between the ages of 25 and 40 (``yes'' -- 45 percent; 
``neither yes nor no'' -- 20 percent; and ``no'' -- 26 percent). 
Among people over the age of 55 there are an equal number of 
people interested in environmental issues as there are persons 
who are indifferent to them (``yes'' -- 33 percent; ``no'' -- 31 
percent). 
  Most of the people who express a willingness to solve 
environmental protection problems have higher or incomplete 
higher education -- with 51 percent saying ``yes'' (``no'' -- 24 
percent; ``neither yes nor no''-- 18 percent). Among those with 
incomplete secondary education 30 percent responded ``yes'' 
(``no'' -- 31 percent; ``neither yes nor no'' -- 20 percent). 
  Despite the fact that 40 percent of those responding are 
willing to pay, those who really want to do something to improve 
the environmental situation are considerably fewer in number. 
  In response to the question ``Are you willing to give up 
some 
conveniences in your life in order to preserve the 
environment?'' only 30 percent of Russian citizens said ``yes,'' 
and 37 percent said they were ``not willing.'' 
  The least interest in preserving nature at their own expense 
was expressed by rural residents (``yes'' -- 30 percent; ``no'' 
-- 28 percent). The most interest was found among urbanites 
(``yes'' -- 47 percent; ``no'' -- 28 percent). 
  In response to the question ``Are you willing, for the sake 
of preserving the environment, to pay substantially higher 
prices for goods and services so that more money will be 
available for environmental protection?'' 40 percent of those 
surveyed replied ``yes'' and 27 percent said ``no.''

``Through Russian Potholes in a `Little Old Ford,' or, Is the 
Peaceful Atom Not as Scary As It Is Presented?''] 
  [Text] Stop a passerby on the street and ask him 
about ecology. Undoubtedly he will just shrug his shoulders in 
surprise. Really, do we have time for that? They say that 
ecological problems are the problems of a ``well-fed'' society. 
For now, our society is not in that category. It is not 
improbable, however, that after having assured ourselves of a 
reliable piece of bread, we shall find ourselves under a sky 
that is riddled with ozone holes. This problem faces both the 
``well-fed'' society that promotes the consumers' paradise, as 
well as the ``hungry,'' who have been tightening their belts for 
severty years in expectation of mythical benefits. We all live 
on the same planet. What will convince us? Poplar leaves one 
meter long? Six-legged colts or toxic fish that attack people? A 
second Chernobyl? Or a third or fourth...? 
  The discrediting of Russian nuclear energy is the goal of 
the 
``Greenpeace Russia'' ecological organization, according to 
Sergey Yermakov, deputy chief of the Department for Public 
Information and Communication of the Russian Federation's 
Ministry of Atomic Energy (``Who Benefits From It?'' DELOVOY 
MIR, 30 July 1993). He reached this conclusion ``without having 
any direct evidence,'' but based only on the ``activities of one 
branch of `Greenpeace Russia.''' He noticed that one of its 
leaders, a certain Litvinov, who is a United States citizen, has 
a Russian passport. S. Yermakov concluded that ``Litvinov and a 
number of other activists of that organization are not 
concealing the fact that as a first priority they are carrying 
out plans to discredit Russian electrical and nuclear power.'' 
The representative of the Ministry of Atomic Energy declined to 
comment on ``this fact,'' and suggested that readers can do it 
themselves independently. Well, what kind of commentary is 
proposed here? In order to answer, we have to remember what was 
talked about a little earlier: ``... behind the attempts to 
discredit Russian nuclear power stations ... is the desire to 
squeeze Russia out of her traditional markets and lessen the 
interest of her potential partners in purchasing Russian nuclear 
power equipment and technology, as well as an attempt to impart 
an inferiority complex' to our experts, so that it would be 
easier to obtain new ideas, plans, and technology from Russia.'' 
Continuing in this same terminological vein, it is fully logical 
to suspect ``Greenpeace Russia'' of wanting to weaken the 
country's security.... 
  The international ecology organization ``Greenpeace'' was 
formed in 1971. It has its branches in dozens of countries and 
is presently supported by five million inhabitants of our 
planet. Nothing at all can be said about any kind of assistance 
from ``Greenpeace Russia'' with regard to increasing security 
measures at Russian nuclear power stations, a step that has been 
called for both by the representative of the Ministry of Atomic 
Energy and by the editorial offices of DELOVOY MIR. The goal of 
that organization is to present the problems to governments, 
which should then resolve them. ``Greenpeace''--as an 
international organization--and all its branches in different 
countries, including Russian, take their stand against the 
nuclear industry and demand the closure of all nuclear power 
stations beginning with the most dangerous. This goal has 
remained the same since the 1970's, when the organization began 
its anti-nuclear program. 
  I agree with S. Yermakov that our domestic nuclear fuel 
cycle 
``is for all practical purposes no worse than what the West 
has.'' I shall only note that the processing and enriching stage 
for the uranium is one of the dirtiest in the world. Everywhere. 
  I agree that financial assistance allocated by the European 
Community after Chernobyl began to be spent on the 
``bureaucratic machine.'' But the money would not have 
disappeared if it had been put into a specific program. No such 
program, however, was ever proposed. 
  I do not agree that the ``Ministry of Atomic Energy is able 
to exercise full control over the situation in the nuclear 
industry branch.'' The Ministry of Atomic Energy depends on the 
Russian joint-stock company that has a monopoly over selling 
electrical power to foreign countries, as well as domestically. 
Enterprises of the Ministry of Atomic Energy constantly complain 
about poor financing. Pre-labor strike situations develop at 
these enterprises, and sometimes they turn into labor strikes. 
With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, contacts between 
facilities of industrial branches have also fallen apart. 
Everyone resolves this problem in his own way: The managers of 
the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station, for example, are trying to 
organize a consortium of enterprises in Leningrad Oblast. 
Accidents happen one after another: Mid-May at the Zaporozhskiy 
Nuclear Power Station; end of May--at the Kolskiy Nuclear Power 
Station; and mid-July--at the Balakovskiy Nuclear Power Station. 
  I agree that the ``technology in our country for building 
reactors is superior to that of the West in a number of specific 
details.'' But only on paper. In practice, the situation is 
different. All existing reactors are experimental models: Among 
them is not a single one that went into series production, from 
which it follows that not a single aspect of technology proved 
itself. In constructing the foundation blocks for the 
Balakovskiy Nuclear Power Station, the marble pads were replaced 
by local limestone, with which ground water actively interacted, 
causing the limestone to dissolve. The marble was used, 
according to unsubstantiated information, to build a 
departmental sanatorium. 
  I do not agree that ``construction (of the RBMK 
[channel-type, graphite-moderated] reactor) ... changed for the 
better with regard to security or that it conforms to world 
standards.'' Ye. Reshetnikov, Deputy Minister of Atomic Energy, 
noted at one of his press conferences last year that 
theoretically it was impossible to modernize the old Russian 
reactors. Dmitriy Tolmatskiy, coordinator of anti-nuclear 
programs for ``Greenpeace Russia,'' adds that whatever is done 
consists only of cosmetic measures, as for example, increasing 
the number of rods. Hans Blix, director of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), compared the RBMK reactors to old 
Ford automobiles: One can go for a long time in a car like that, 
but only if you choose the direction correctly and drive slowly. 
He emphasized that these reactors could not be brought up to 
Western standards bacause of the excessive cost of the 
protective casings. I think that many readers will agree that it 
would be very problematical to drive in an ``old Ford,'' on 
Russian roads that are full of economic ruts, inter-national 
potholes, and political bumps. 
  In the 1960's it seemed that nuclear energy would become an 
inexhaustable, inexpensive, and harmless source for those living 
on our planet. Time gradually dispersed these illusions. In 
1979, an accident at Three Mile Island; 1986--the accident at 
Chernobyl. The peaceful atom turned out to be not as harmless as 
many had thought. There were fewer and fewer supporters of 
nuclear energy. Right now not a single insurance company will 
insure a nuclear power station anywhere in the world. Atomic 
energy has become insolvent, not only from an ecological, but 
also from an economic standpoint. Before, the cost of atomic 
energy did not include expenditures for liquidating accident 
damages, mining the raw material, processing and transporting 
it. Alternative sources of energy require a lot fewer expenses, 
as we shall discuss later. All this led to the nuclear industry 
being squeezed out of the world energy producing market. This 
conclusion was reached by researchers at the Institute for World 
Processes (Washington), the Services for Energy Information 
(Paris), and the International Greenpeace organization 
(Amsterdam). From their ``Report on the Status of the World 
Nuclear Industry: 1992'' (hereafter cited as ``Report''), we 
find that at the beginning of 1992 there were ten fewer nuclear 
power stations in the world than in December 1988; and at the 
end of 1991, 49 stations were being built around the world, 
which is four times fewer than ten years ago. 
  S. Yermakov does not agree with this. He maintains that ``an 
accelerated development of nuclear power engineering is taking 
place in a number of Western countries,'' and he cites the 
examples of Japan, France, and England. Since Japan and France 
are exceptions to the worldwide trend, all supporters of nuclear 
power engineering in the world are rallying to their 
``expansionist'' plans. 
  The nuclear industry in France began to develop in the 
1970's 
as a result of concern at increasing oil prices, according to 
the ``Report.'' At present, 56 reactors working at full capacity 
provide 75 percent of France's electrical power. Since there are 
seven reactors too many, France has to sell its energy to 
neighboring countries at low prices. France has nearly one half 
of the nuclear power potential of Western Europe. As a result of 
this large-scale construction, the debt of the state municipal 
services of France was 214 million French francs (or 38 million 
US dollars) at the beginning of 1992. The debt grew because huge 
subsidies were given as a reward for using nuclear energy and to 
justify investments in this branch of industry. For the amount 
of energy produced per one megawatt of power in a nuclear power 
station, France is on a rather low level in comparison with 
other countries. This gap will increase if five additional 
nuclear power stations are built by the end of the century. The 
development of French nuclear power engineering is, however, 
slowing down and is now at the level where it can only support 
the work of the state nuclear industry. The last order for 
building a nuclear reactor was received in 1987. Japan has 42 
nuclear power stations that provide 27 percent of all the 
country's energy. Ten additional stations are being built. By 
the year 2010, the government plans to have 80 reactors, which 
is improbable. There is also serious opposition to these plans: 
47 percent of the population believes that Japanese nuclear 
power stations are ``relatively unsafe'' or ``completely 
unsafe.'' Even nuclear experts agree that new nuclear power 
stations can be built only in countries that already have them. 
In the last five years, however, not a single new area has been 
acquired for this purpose. 
  What then would replace nuclear power stations if we 
decide--after all--to do away with them? Alternative sources of 
energy: Solar, wind, tidal, and geothermal plants. But the main 
attention, according to Lika Galkina, coordinator of 
anti-nuclear programs of ``Greenpeace Russia,'' should be 
devoted to gas turbine plants of the ``Vityaz'' type that we 
already have. A necessary parallel action is to decrease losses 
of oil and gas during extraction and transportation. Several 
million tonnes of oil spill out of broken pipelines every year 
in Russia, notes Aleksey Yablokov, adviser to the president of 
the Russian Federation on ecology and health protection. The 
most lit up part of our planet as seen in a night photograph 
taken from space is the area of Northwest Siberia: Tens of 
thousands of continually burning torches merge into a spot 
brighter than New York, Los Angeles, or Tokyo. The quickest and 
most effective way to slow down global warming, according to 
U.S. Vice President Albert Gore, is to stop the gas leaks in 
Siberia. A great amount of energy is lost in thermal and 
electrical grids because of the use of old power-consuming 
technology and simply because of poor insulation of houses. In 
order to regulate heating, special battery-operated valves 
should be installed, as has been done in all developed countries 
for many years now. Incidentally, 70 percent of the people 
living in Munich turn off their heating even when they go for a 
two-hour walk. The loss of electrical energy will be 
substantially less if old electrical motors are exchanged for 
new, more efficient ones. Electrical motors in most of the 
industrial countries now use over one half of available 
electrical power. Fluorescent lamps, replacing the usual 
incandescent lamps, give off as much light, use one quarter of 
the energy needed by their predecessors, and last ten times 
longer. It would be advisable to introduce conditions for the 
efficient use of energy in making financial loans, such as, for 
example, what the World Bank did with a loan to Brazil. 
  ``After me, the deluge!'' This pronouncement of Louis XV is, 
unfortunately, more famous than the slogan of the ``Greenpeace'' 
people: ``To save in the environment what can still be saved!'' 
How can we reach the point where we shall think not only of our 
stomachs, but also about nature which fills our stomachs with 
its gifts? One time the Greenpeace people made a giant 
transparency 1,000 square meters in size. Too small? I think 
they could make it even 2,000 square meters. And how much is 
needed? Three, four?....

<F P=106> [Interview with V.I. Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation </F>
minister for protection of the environment and natural 
resources, by ZELENYY MIR correspondent N. Filimonova; place and 
date not given: ``New Does Not Mean Better''] 
  [Text] At ZELENYY MIR's request, V.I. 
Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation minister for protection of 
the environment and natural resources, comments on the idea of 
creating a state oversight system in a conversation with our 
correspondent N. Filimonova. 
  Filimonova: Viktor Ivanovich, do you believe that 
there is a need to create a new system? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: No, and I do not share the draft 
authors' position, although I do understand what it is based on. 
  Dissatisfaction with the state of the environment in the 
Russian Federation is causing many people contemplate how the 
situation could be improved. Unfortunately, many opt for a 
traditional Soviet way--asking themselves how to reorganize 
environmental protection bodies. 
  I often read initiative memoranda on this topic, proposals 
to 
the government, specialists' letters in newspapers and 
magazines. And all of them are structured following a standard 
scheme: First they register the fact that the ecological 
situation is very alarming, quote some statistics--all of them 
usually borrowed from the national report ``On the State of the 
Environment in the Russian Federation in 1991,'' which was 
prepared under the auspices of the Ministry for Protection of 
the Environment and Natural Resources, and then propose a new 
structure for an environmental protection system which, they 
say, will help to solve all the problems. 
  Filimonova: This standard approach does not mean 
that the proposals are worthless. Some of them deserve attention 
perhaps? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: The draft document we are 
looking at would not withstand criticism on several points. 
  First, in principle. A completely wrong conclusion is drawn 
from an unquestionably true premise: Since the environment is in 
terrible shape, we need to reorganize environmental protection 
bodies. 
  Second, they propose to reorganize not only our structure 
but 
the entire system of monitoring and oversight. That is, the 
conclusion extends far beyond the premise. 
  In addition to the three oversight committees currently in 
existence (the Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight, 
the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, and the Russian Federal 
Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety), the draft proposes 
to create seven new committees! In the current situation, when 
there is not enough money for the most urgent undertakings, to 
start such a reorganization is socially wrong! We need to think 
how, to the extent possible, to cut the number of agencies, not 
breed new ones. 
  Filimonova: In the opinion of some economists, 
however, separating oversight and monitoring services will allow 
us to bring order to our economy. 
  Danilov-Danilyan: The source of these proposals is 
the perception that the Ministry for Protection of the 
Environment and Natural Resources, they think, combines these 
functions with economic activities. This is not the case, 
however. We are not involved in any economic activities 
whatsoever! There is not a single natural resource that is 
utilized by the ministry's units or enterprises and 
organizations subordinate to it. We only regulate resource 
consumption by other sectors' enterprises using direct 
limitations (quotas) or indirect means (payment amounting to 
in-kind taxes). And what is monitoring and oversight if not a 
form of regulation? 
  Separating monitoring and oversight services into 
independent 
organizations will only make conducting an integrated long-term 
ecological policy more difficult, since it includes setting 
norms and standards; forming a system of sanctions for 
violations; introducing payment for discharges, environmental 
pollution, and utilization of natural resources; improving the 
taxation system and the mechanism of ecological expert 
evaluation; management of the natural preserves system; and 
development of ecological programs--scientific-technological and 
investment. 
  Unfortunately, quite often the people whose job includes 
development of ecological policy are unable to grasp this set of 
problems in its entirety. They overestimate the importance of 
some components of this policy while underestimating others. 
Such an approach is ruinous right now for the system of 
environmental protection, Environmental protection bodies should 
not be playing the role of slave-driver--they need to work with 
producers rather than just crack the whip... 
  It is said that the standards we set for producers are too 
low... Well, let us raise them--and bankrupt most enterprises. 
Is this what we need? 
  A pauper is not capable of anything. Only he who has 
property, opportunities, and means can do something (including 
in the area of environmental protection). Yes, it would be best 
for the environment if we cease all production activity. But if 
this is impossible, let us look at things realistically. 
  Filimonova: But you would agree that the 
environmental protection inspectorate is in such a dismal shape 
now that precisely the monitoring and oversight components of an 
integrated ecological policy may fail. 
  Danilov-Danilyan: Our inspectorate had always been 
financed as a different ``line item'' than the actual 
environmental protection bodies, and therefore in worse shape. I 
think we have resolved this problem--unless there is a return to 
the past in the process of making changes in the 1993 budget, 
the inspectorate's situation will improve considerably. Now we 
are taking the next step--getting the needed material and 
technical support for these services: instruments, 
transportation, communications, information processing 
capabilities, etc. 
  Have you ever seen financial and material and technical 
support of an organization improve when it is split into 
separate parts, or at least not deteriorate? If we start 
dividing territorial environmental protection committees now, we 
will have to divide financing, staff rosters, facilities (in 
some oblasts this will be a catastrophic development), means of 
transportation... For a year nobody will work--everybody will be 
busy dividing property. 
  Filimonova: Well, what can we do--this is the way 
it is always done in Russia... 
  Danilov-Danilyan: This is the last thing we need 
right now. We will again have a situation which our prime 
minister (on a different occasion) described this way: ``We 
wanted to do better, but it came out is usual.'' 
  Filimonova: And personnel? How do you divide 
personnel? 
  Danilov-Danilyan: There are not too many good 
cadres, highly skilled and capable of being good administrators, 
on the local level. If we start breeding new agencies on a scale 
proposed in the draft under consideration, it will inevitably 
lead to a decline in the quality of administration in each of 
them. 
  Under the powerful pressure of the geological, forestry, and 
water management lobby (all these lobbies we have now!), the 
corresponding committees have been separated from the ministry. 
They have become autonomous entities under the government as 
committees or federal services. I am convinced, however, that 
this has not strengthened the environmental protection system; 
on the contrary, it has weakened it, because it is more 
difficult now to resolve coordination problems. For objective 
reasons, however, this splintered system has to be managed as an 
integral whole, while retaining within limits of expediency 
independence of its units. 
  Unfortunately, the initiators of the creation of state 
oversight of technology-related and ecological safety, while 
painting a pretty organizational scheme, did not have a good 
conception either as to how to implement this scheme or of the 
consequences of its implementation: where they will get the 
expected results, and where exactly the opposite. They obviously 
lack knowledge of reality.

Exploited Nature over the Decades Without Control: The Situation 
Might Change after Approval of the Edict of the President of 
Russia on the Establishment of Ministry of Defense Ecological 
Subunits''] 
  [Text] The recent discharge of liquid radioactive wastes 
into the Sea of Japan by a tanker of the Russian Navy attracted 
keen attention, it seems, only because of the foreign policy 
complications that the Russian authorities caused themselves. 
Against the background of Russia's dumping radioactive wastes 
with an activity of 55.2 Curies just last year, the sensation 
raised by about 900 cubic liters of radioactive water with a 
strength of ``a total'' of one Curie looks at the very least 
greatly exaggerated. There are 394 reactors on 228 nuclear 
vessels of the country's Navy, and contamination of seas and 
oceans by radioactive wastes is inevitable at least for several 
more years, until such time as technical and financial problems 
of their utilization are resolved. 
  Meanwhile, if the international aspect is dismissed, the 
latest incident is a good reason to examine more attentively an 
entire complex of questions associated with the effect of the 
activity of the Armed Forces on the ecological situation in the 
country. Especially because this is already not the first case 
when the Russian MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs], and before 
this the Soviet MFA, had to take the rap for the actions of its 
military, whose attitude toward nature was traditionally based 
on the well-known principle ``after us the deluge.'' It is 
enough to mention at least the multibillion sums of damage 
caused by the Soviet Army in the countries of Eastern Europe, as 
compensation for which the USSR and Russia had to abandon the 
right to real estate of hundreds of military facilities in this 
region. Even if a correction is made to the vested interest of 
the governments of East European countries in increasing the 
sums of ecological damage, it is still measured in astronomical 
figures, and one can only guess the scale of similar damage to 
the environment on the territory of the ex-USSR itself, where 
the Army operated in an incomparably more free and easy manner. 
  Today in Russia alone 12.8 million hectares of land are used 
by the Ministry of Defense, of which 1.3 million is assigned to 
test ranges. According to expert assessments, the level of the 
aggregate anthropogenic load on the environment as a result of 
the activity of the VPK [military-industrial complex] is 
comparable to the negative effects on it of all of the other 
branches. The existing curtain of secrecy around the Army and 
defense enterprises for decades guaranteed them practically 
uncontrolled exploitation of the natural complex and, when the 
curtain was finally raised, the time came to harvest the bitter 
fruit. Standing in the same rank as the already mentioned 
contamination of seacoasts with radioactive wastes is the 
problem of the negative consequences of the tests of space and 
rocket technology. According to data of the Ministry of 
Environment and Natural Resources of Russia, the production of 
the rocket-space branches emits 75,000 tonnes of toxic compounds 
annually, and another 55,000 tonnes are poured into various 
reservoirs. The general field area for dropping spent 
rockets/booster stages (OChR) allocated to the Ministry of 
Defense totals 9 million square kilometers, and 250 areas were 
taken out of economic use specifically for these purposes. Some 
of them, especially in Arkhangelsk Oblast and Yakutia, are 
contaminated with the unburnt residue of the highly toxic rocket 
fuel heptyl, whose period of decay under permafrost conditions 
and low temperatures extends several thousand years. Accidents, 
against which the rocket-space industry is also not guaranteed, 
represent a significant threat to the environment. For example, 
in 1985 the Tsyklon space-launch vehicle with a weather 
satellite on board fell into the Northern Dvina as a result of a 
catastrophe and, breaking through the ice, sank to the 
bottom--heptyl was also a part of its two-component fuel. All 
this in the end was supposed to cause a negative reaction, and 
today the administrations of the Republic of Altay and Omsk, 
Tomsk, and Arkhangelsk Oblasts have prohibited the launch of 
rockets and space vehicles until there is an expert ecological 
analysis of areas for dropping OChR. 
  The accelerating rates of the processes of disarmament are 
also creating their own ecological problems. Just with 
implementation of the START 1 and START 2 treaties it will be 
necessary for Russia by the year 2000 to withdraw from Strategic 
Missile Troops units about 100,000 tonnes of highly toxic 
substances, to which another 30,000 tonnes should be added that 
have been accumulated by the Air Defense Troops. The enormous 
reserves of chemical weapons of the former USSR, whose 
destruction is envisioned in international treaties, constitutes 
a separate problem. 
  Besides ecological damage, by contaminating the environment 
the Armed Forces also cause purely economic losses. Thus, 
because of the poor technical condition and improper operation 
of fuel storage on military airfields, a majority of which were 
constructed as far back as the 1950's and 1960's, tens of 
thousands of tonnes of petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) are 
lost annually. This problem is especially acute in Mozdok, 
Engels, and Yeysk, although it is urgent not only for Russia. 
Not long ago the program ``Vesti'' showed a report from 
Ukraine, where local ecologists demonstrated samples of subsoil 
water from one of the air bases that flared up when a match was 
brought to it. In Germany, zealous Germans announced plans to 
begin the industrial extraction of kerosene from an underground 
cavity under a former Soviet troop airfield where a man-made 
lake formed over several decades. The ground in many garrisons 
is saturated with this same kind of kerosene that was discarded 
by aircraft in the form of unexpended fuel during a landing 
approach. All told, 5,000 hectares of land in Russia alone are 
contaminated with the Army's oil products and wastes. 
  However, there are indications today that the attitude, if 
not of the Army toward nature, then, in any case, of society 
toward the Army's disgraceful ecological practices, is beginning 
to change more and more. The economic factors of wildlife 
management that are being introduced are making themselves felt. 
In 1992 the total fines imposed on military units for 
contaminating the environment totalled 43.5 million rubles [R], 
and it is already clear that this year it will be several orders 
of magnitude more. For example, local authorities submitted a 
bill of R24 billion to the aviation garrison of the city of 
Engels alone. Nonetheless, if you take into account that the 
Army is on budget financing, similar economic sanctions resemble 
taking money out of one pocket and putting it into another. 
Therefore, in the opinion of specialists, a different way is 
more productive. The recently established Interdepartmental 
Commission on Ecological Safety of the Security Council examined 
the ecological aspects of the activity of the Armed Forces at a 
meeting in October. The result of its work was a draft edict of 
the president ``On the Establishment of Ecological Subunits of 
the Ministry of Defense of Russia.'' It should be noted here 
that the administration of ecology and special means of 
protection, numbering 240 employees, began to operate in the 
structure of the Russian defense department last year; however, 
as it became clear, it evidently does not have enough forces to 
influence the situation at least in some way. In comparison, the 
ecological subunits in a majority of the NATO countries have 
already existed for many years, and number 1,700 persons even in 
little Norway. In the United States, $5 billion has been 
allocated for 1994 for environmental protection work, which is 2 
percent of the entire military budget. 
  The prepared draft of the edict of the president of Russia 
proposes that Army environmental protection services also be 
formed in our country. The concept of ecological support of the 
Armed Forces that was approved by the chief of the General Staff 
envisions the formation of ecological subunits in groups and 
arms of service in 1993-1994, and each military district will 
have them in the following two years. If these plans are fated 
to take place, there is a hope that the Army not only will be 
able to indemnify the damage to the environment that its own 
activity causes, but also solve ecological problems that 
confront the whole state.

  [Text] The commander in chief of Russia's Navy has set up a 
department charged with assuring the safety of vessels with 
nuclear power installations. The head of this department, 
Commodore Viktor (Sakharov) told us about the recent dumping of 
some of the Pacific Fleet's radioactive waste intothe Sea of 
Japan, which all but caused complications in Russo-Japanese 
relations. 
  [Begin (Sakharov) recording in Russian, fading into 
English translation] The dumping on 17 October was planned. 
It was sanctioned by the Russian Ministry of Environmental 
Protection. Some 90 cubic meters of liquid radioactive waste 
were dumped into the Sea of Japan. Their total activity was 
0.38 Curie. Everything was done according to schedule in the 
presence of an official from the ministry. The surface layer of 
the sea was monitored throughout the dumping. The gamma 
radiation at a distance of 20 meters from the dumping site did 
not exceed the background radiation. [end recording] 
  Asked whether the Navy could give up dumping at sea, 
(Sakharov) said this: The Navy has a big problem. It so far has 
no shore installations for radioactive waste disposal and it 
won't have them until after 1997. So it has to use the methods 
it has employed up to now. In general, (Sakharov) believes the 
Navy should not be concerned with the storage or disposal of 
radioactive waste. The problem should be dealt with on a 
national scale by a single state body. In other words, the Navy 
should turn its waste over to some reprocessing plant and pay 
for its services. Such plants would reprocess the waste of all 
the ministries and other agencies that operate nuclear 
installations. 
  Asked how the problem is dealt with in other countries, 
(Sakharov) provided this information: Nearly all the countries 
operating nuclear power installations face the same problems. 
Until recently, most of them dumped liquid radioactive waste 
into the sea. Commodore (Sakharov) says he and his colleagues 
are well aware that this is no solution to the problem. The 
problem has to be solved radically. Eventually the radioactive 
waste dumped into the sea will worsen the environmental 
situation, first locally in individual areas and then on a 
bigger scale affecting the animal and plant world and human 
beings. The problem can hardly be solved by the Navy or, for 
that matter, by the country. It has to be tackled by all 
nations since humanity has no intention of giving up nuclear 
power.

  [Text] Azerbaijan's permanent mission to the United Nations 
has conveyed an appeal by the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences and 
the Azerbaijan Committee for Supervision of Ecological 
Protection and Use of Natural Resources to the UN Security 
Council, UNESCO, the leading officials of organizations 
responsible for the protection of the environment, the 
presidents of the CIS Academies of Sciences, and the CSCE 
Intergovernmental Council for Ecological Protection. It called 
for halting the damage caused to Azerbaijan's plant life and 
forests as a result of the Armenian occupationist war. The 
appeal said: 
  The Transcaucasus plays an important role in the ecological 
balance of the world. However, the region is faced with the 
danger of destruction and ruin. The ecological balance has been 
disrupted in the Transcaucasus and serious damage has been 
caused to the soil structure, forests, and plant life in the 
region as a result of air raids and the use of heavy artillery 
and rockets in the war Armenia wages against Azerbaijan. 
Several rare varieties of plants have become extinct. They 
were unique to the region. In addition, rare varieties of 
animals, which are also unique to the region, are threatened. 
  The appeal later said the following: 
  The rare forests in the region are being destroyed. Other 
important natural resources, including forest reserves, are also 
threatened. Many of the areas reserved for forests have been 
turned into battlefields. Consequently, the damage Azerbaijan 
has suffered totals more than $1 billion. Combat is taking 
place in 260 hectares of afforested areas. The aggressors cut 
down the trees and transport them to Armenia during their 
military operations in those areas. The world is helpless to 
protect the vitally important forests in the region, which are a 
source of oxygen and fresh air. The war Armenia has been waging 
against Azerbaijan has caused serious damage to our republic's 
natural resources. In general, this is a serious loss for 
humanity. 
  That behavior has been described by the convention on war 
victims, the protocol added to that convention, and the 1978 
convention, which condemns as an international crime military 
and other measures against natural resources. Any country that 
resorts to such behavior is guilty of committing a crime against 
the international community and the country it attacks. In view 
of that, Armenia must pay compensation for the damage it has 
caused to Azerbaijan. Furthermore, in accordance with the norms 
of international law, that republic must be held responsible for 
repairing the damage it has caused to the region. 
  The appeal concluded: 
  That behavior, which has remained unobstructed, constitutes 
a 
crime not only against Azerbaijan but also against the entire 
world. Therefore, we urge you to direct the necessary pressure 
on the aggressor to end the war. We also urge you to bring a 
court action against the aggressor. The existing situation 
requires an urgent and undelayed intervention by the 
international community.

  [Text] Tokyo, Nov 16 TASS -- One million U.S. dollars worth 
of humanitarian aid will be rendered by Japan to Belarus to 
overcome the Chernobyl accident aftermath, in accordance with 
today's decision of the Japanese Government. 
  The first batch of the humanitarian cargo to include high- 
precision medical equipment and diagnostics instruments will be 
sent to Belarusian hospitals in mid-December. The other will be 
supplied in Minsk by February 1994. 
  According to a report of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the 
action will be done within the framework of a 100 million dollar 
program of assistance to former Soviet republics. It was 
adopted by an international conference on assistance to new 
independent states -- 12 former soviet republics with the 
exception of the Baltic states -- in October 1992 in Tokyo.

<F P=106> [Report by Iryna Syarohina: ``Are Sun, Air, and Water Our </F>
Enemies?''] 
  [Text] Nowadays, life expectancy in Belarus is one of the 
shortest in the world. 
  According to Academician I.I. Lishtvin, secretary of the 
Belarusian Academy of Sciences and director of the Institute for 
Ecology and Use of Natural Resources, this is connected not only 
with the aftermath of the catastrophe at the Chernobyl Nuclear 
Power Plant. We have already interfered in biological processes 
of nature to such an extent that further development of 
civilization requires special measures. Thus, for instance, 
while reclaiming a marsh, nobody thought about the harm to the 
atmosphere -- 1 hectare of marsh equalizes 5 hectares of forests 
for absorbing pollutants from the atmosphere. Purity of the 
atmosphere is an issue of great importance especially now, when 
the stream of cars used in the Republic has increased.

  [Text] Usually they do not talk about water. And if they 
do, it means there is a problem. This article was prompted as a 
result of a drinking water inspection conducted by local 
organizations of the Belstandart in conjunction with 
representatives of the Sanitary and Epidemiologic Services at 
the Belarusian Health Ministry. 
  Of 39 inspected water-supply facilities, only seven had 
water 
that was up to present safety standards. Serious violations of 
chemical and microbiological requirements were reported at the 
remaining facilities, which is 82.5 percent of those inspected. 
For example, drinking water supplied by the Berestovtsy Housing 
and Municipal Property Amalgamation failed to meet requirements 
as to iron levels and intestine bacilli, while the water 
supplied to residents of Novopoltsk was excessively hard and had 
a high concentration of ammonia and its ions. 
  Also alarming are the results of an inspection conducted at 
the Buda-Koshelev Housing and Municipal Property Amalgamation, 
where the iron content and turbidity of drinking water are 
beyond established limits. 
  What are the main reasons for such high pollution of the 
drinking water? In the first place, it is an excessive 
concentration of iron in underground waters, inefficient 
iron-removing facilities or lack of those, lack of 
water-treatment equipment, lax control over the quality of 
drinking water on the part of relevant agencies. 
  Local Belstandart organizations levied fines on enterprises 
violating water requirements. Officials found guilty of 
permitting use of dirty water were severely reprimanded. 
Findings of inspections of the Horodok, Beshenkovichi, and 
Mozyr Housing and Municipal Property Amalgamations were sent to 
the prosecutor's office.

reservoirs for collecting effluent from the Kazakh capital and 
its satellite cities were built a few kilometers from Almaty. 
Most of the effluent was channeled into the (?Zhaman-kum)

killed at the time. Following the breach of the (?Zhaman-kum), 
all the effluent containing heavy metals, carcinogenic 
substances, petrochemical products, and also various bacteria 
and viruses ended up in the Sorbulak reservoir. The water level 
in the Sorbulak reservoir began to rise sharply. The threat of 
a breach emerged.

critical. Another year, and the water may pour over the dike 
and there will be a catastrophe. There is a real threat of 
50,000 people being killed.

  [Text] Riga, Nov 20 BNS -- The Latvian Environmental 
Protection club dislikes intentions of the Liechtenstein-based 
Premex Antstalt firm to build a waste burning plant in Latvia, 
the club's spokesman Pavils Raudonis told BNS. 
  The club recognizes the need for treating toxic waste but 
says that the Premex Antstalt's project contradicts the Latvian 
law on dangerous waste and a respective Basel convention. 
  The project provides to build a plant for burning highly 
toxic chemical waste in the vicinity of the Riga port. The firm 
plans to process not only Latvia's own waste but to bring it in 
from Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the CIS and 
the United States. 
  The first stage of the project envisions to build one 
processor able to burn down 50 percent of the totally planned 
volume of noxious substances. Later, two more processors would 
be built. From their total burning capacity of 300 tons per 
year, 20 percent would be Latvia's own and 80 percent -- 
imported waste. 
  The project requires a $450 million investment and 10 
million 
U.S. dollars in yearly operational costs.

``Vesti'' newscast] 
  [Text] The story of the U.S. vessel, the United States, 
which arrived in Sevastopol at the beginning of November, is 
starting to develop in an unexpected way. Its present Turkish 
bosses are trying to find a town prepared to dismantle and store 
300,000 square meters of asbestos roofing. Such work would cost 
the United States $125 million. Turkey, following numerous 
protests from the ``Greens,'' banned the dismantling within its 
territorial waters. A factory in Sevastopol, that would be 
prepared to do this for $1 million, is being picketed by 
Greenpeace representatives, together with alarmed members of the 
public. They are indignant at the intention to bury the 
asbestos which is causing cancer and other grave illnesses on 
the southern coast of the Crimea. However, the borders of the 
CIS are clearly inaccessible to waste products. 
  The United States now plans to take the asbestos to Russia 
and to bury it in the town of Azbest. A practice whereby rich 
countries produce waste and the poorer pay for it with their 
health and lives through burying, processing, or destroying it 
is absolutely immoral, Greenpeace says. We are demanding the 
immediate return of this poisonous vessel to its homeland, the 
United States. [video shows Greenpeace dinghy mooring alongside

<F P=106> [Report by Olena Egorove: ``Where Is the National Program of </F>
Energy Conservation?''] 
  [Text] Sergey Kurikin, a member of the political council of 
the Party of Greens of Ukraine, told our correspondent his 
opinion on the Chernobyl atomic power plant. 
  Middle and high level officials whose work is connected with 
the continuation of operations at the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant are anxious about the prospects of its possible closing. 
First, they launched their attack in the fall of 1990, in the 
times of the erstwhile USSR. A high commission from Moscow, 
checking the security of the blocks, proposed that the safe 
blocks that had not exploded in 1986 continue working. That was 
just the beginning. A direct attack began in 1992 when nuclear 
scientists forced the Ukrainian president to say: ``Nuclear 
power engineering has no alternatives.'' Having received 
``carte blanche,'' the nuclear lobby launched a campaign 
against antinuclear forces and supported the president through 
various seminars and conferences. On 21 September, our deputies 
only had to sum up the numerical superiority of the influential 
lobbyists. 
  Will the Supreme Council decisions help us live through a 
cold winter? I doubt it since the Chernobyl nuclear power plant 
produces only 2 percent of the electricity, and the three 
recently closed nuclear blocks are not going to start operating 
before spring 1994. At the same time, I can guarantee that the 
cost of their repairs will twist the inflation spiral. In 
addition, I want to remind you that our losses from operating 
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant stand at 200 billion 
karbovanetses [K] (in 1990 prices). The work on this power 
plant and its operation will cost us K12 billion additionally. 
This financial prognosis was prepared by former plant manager 
Shcherbina. 
  Our deputies often cite Russia as an example of safely 
operating nuclear power plants. However, why not take the 
United States which has not been constructing nuclear power 
plants for decades now? 
  As for United States citizens, they learn from their 
mistakes. After the Three Mile Island accident, they do not 
identify technical progress with the development of nuclear 
power engineering. 
  Mankind has not yet created wasteless nuclear power 
engineering. V. Mikhaylov, Russian minister of nuclear power 
engineering, explained this tactfully at a Tokyo press 
conference. Thus, the waste from Russian nuclear power plants 
will be poured into the Sea of Japan and, according to 
Mikhaylov, it is no more poisonous than the Japanese nuclear 
waste. So, no problems.... 
  Where are we going to spill our nuclear waste? Into the 
Dnieper River or the Black Sea? 
  Currently, our children's destiny is in the hands of the so- 
called Chernobyl reanimators.

Environmental Protection and UKRINFORM: ``German Experts Study 
Circumstances Under Which Toxic Waste Was Brought Into Ukraine''] 
  [Text] As reported by the mass media, this year toxic waste 
has been illegally brought from Germany to the territory of 
Rivne and Nikolayev oblasts. 
  Ukraine's Minister of Environmental Protection Yuriy 
Kostenko 
turned to the German Minister of Environmental Protection, 
Resources, and Nuclear Safety Dr. Klaus Toepfer with a request 
to send German experts to identify these substances and find out 
the circumstances under which they were brought from the FRG to 
Ukraine. 
  In accordance with the agreement concluded between the 
ministries in summer 1993, a group of German experts headed by 
representative of the Federal Ministry of Environmental 
Protection, Resources, and Nuclear Safety Andre Radde arrived in 
Ukraine on 22 November. 
  The delegation is composed of both technological experts, 
who 
have brought along a chemical microlaboratory, and lawyers, 
representatives of the land of Saxony-Anhalt, who will study the 
legal aspects of the problem. Since July 1993, an investigation 
has been under way in that land on the export of the waste, and 
lawyers are having to collect evidence for the case. 
  The delegation members have confirmed the FRG Government's 
intention to take measures for putting an end to the illegal 
export of waste from the country. 
  Ukraine's Ministry of Environmental Protection and the FRG 
Embassy in Ukraine have agreed to hold a news conference on the 
results of the delegation's work,

  [Text] Brussels, Dec 3 (AFP) -- European Community 
environment ministers remained deadlocked here Friday [3 
December] over how to handle the 50 million tonnes of packaging 
waste generated each year in the 12-nation EC. 
  In an 18-hour meeting that started Thursday [2 December], 
Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands refused to accept a 
proposal that EC countries should be made to recycle up to an 
initial 45 percent of paper, glass and aluminium packaging. 
  The three countries said the target was too low, and meant 
that they would have to relax their own recycling laws and thus 
produce more waste. 
  ``It is absurd to try to impose ceilings which would 
increase 
the waste produced by some countries,'' German Secretary of 
State Clemens Stroetmann said. 
  He refused to accept a compromise proposal which would allow 
some countries to exceed the recycling limits, on the grounds 
that they would then have to show they have adequate recycling 
capacity. 
  Germany is currently involved in a row with some of its EC 
neighbours because it produces more recyclable waste than it can 
process, and exports much of it for treatment, notably to France 
and Spain. 
  The EC's poorer southern members, meanwhile, argued that 
they 
should be exempted from the recycling norms because they could 
not afford the necessary recycling capacity. 
  EC Environment Commissioner Ioannis Paleokrassas said 
failure 
to establish recycling norms would result in legal battles 
between neighbouring countries. 
  The European Commission maintains that harmonisation is 
necessary because, under EC single market laws, no country is 
supposed to impose regulations that impede the free market of 
products around the community. 
  However, the European Court of Justice has said Denmark is 
justified in banning imports of aluminium cans because the Danes 
do not have sufficient recycling capacity to handle them. 
  The Belgian chairman of the environment ministers' council, 
Magda de Galan, called a special meeting for 13 December in a 
bid to find a compromise. 
  She said that meeting would also debate a controversial 
proposal to institute a tax on energy and carbon fuels as a way 
of fighting global warming. 
  The meeting could not agree Friday on a joint ratification 
of 
the Rio convention on climatic change by the year-end, despite 
their commitment to do so at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro 
in June 1992. 
  Germany, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and 
Luxembourg have demanded that ratification should go 
hand-in-hand with a decision to impose an energy tax. But 
Britain has refused to accept such a tax. 
  Earlier, the ministers agreed to cut the production of 
methyl 
bromide, a toxic fumigant and pesticide, by 25 percent before 1 
January 1998. 
  And they decided to speed up the phasing out of 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which is used mainly in refrigeration 
and is harmful to the earth's ozone layer. Production will be 
cut 35 percent by 2004 and stopped entirely by 2015.

  [Text] Brussels, Nov 22 (AFP) -- Britain is pressing for 
the European Community to pay more attention to the cost of the 
measures it imposes on member states, British Chancellor of the 
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said here Monday. 
  Speaking after a meeting of EC finance ministers, he claimed 
to have won considerable sympathy for his complaint that the 
cost of a waste water treatment system accepted by Britain in 
1991 had spiralled out of control. 
  British officials say the cost of the system has snowballed 
to 10 billion pounds (about 15 billion dollars) currently, up 
from an estimate of two billion pounds (three billion dollars) 
in 1991. 
  Clarke said Britain wanted the European Commission to accept 
that the project would be phased in over a longer period, to 
lessen the effect on the water bills of British consumers. 
  But he used the issue to highlight the way in which EC 
decisions often had ``unexpected economic consequences,'' and 
urged that EC finance ministers be allowed in future to vet all 
decisions carrying substantial costs. 
  Under the water treatment directive, all towns with over 
10,000 people must add a third stage to the treatment of waste 
water being discharged into ``sensitive areas'' such as the 
ocean if seawater cannot clean it up naturally. 
  ``In health terms the directive is desirable,'' Clarke 
admitted, but added that it was too expensive to be fully 
implemented by the target date of 1998.

<H5>  High Risk Examination Process </H5>
  It was not with a light heart that the Commission embarked 
up 
the process it was instructed to carry out by EC government 
leaders. The examination of this report, on December 10-11 at 
the EC Summit in Brussels, will be a highly risky business. The 
Commission speaks of several hurdles that need to be cleared, 
otherwise EC activities could become totally paralysed. This 
year alone, the EC has repealed 158 proposals thought to be 
technical or politically out of date because of the subsidiarity 
principle. 
  This first hurdle consists of making sure that this 
examination does not lead to a fresh in-depth debate and the 
possibility of controversial texts being called into question. 
Second, the simplification process is nonsensical unless the 
Commission has a free hand to negotiate international agreements 
and avoid duplication. Third, the EC has to decide just how far 
the EC's exclusive area of business extends, for there is every 
chance that ``the application of proportionality will meet 
resistance from some national administrations, which because of 
a lack of mutual confidence are anxious to obtain the most 
detailed regulations possible.'' The Commission also wants to 
extend the mutual recognition principle and to make better use 
of the way in which it delegates its powers of implementation. 
  These conditions are nigh impossible. The enshrinement of 
the 
subsidiarity principle in the Maastricht Treaty was a highly 
political matter during the negotiations and the result of a 
difficult compromise between those seeking to extend EC 
activities and those resisting the idea. John Major was the main 
architect of the principle. The UK Prime Minister agreed to the 
proposal to enlarge the Community's areas of business only on 
condition that it would be compensated for by a control 
principle, namely subsidiarity. Because of the No vote in June 
1992 during the first Danish referendum on the Maastricht 
Treaty, the principle became very popular in Denmark and 
Germany, even though on first sight it hardly seemed a 
vote-catching concept. It became so popular that at the 
Edinburgh Summit in December 1992 half a dozen or so pages of 
the European Council's conclusions were devoted to this subject. 
  Over above the issue of political rehabilitation, this still 
leaves the basic problem: what is sought from Europe varies 
quite considerably from one Member State to another and from one 
national administration to another. ``Delegations which are most 
in favour of subsidiarity at a political level are those which 
call for harmonisation in the finest detail at legal level,'' 
notes the report.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Environment/Competitiveness: </F>
Eco-Taxes Championed as Growth Promoters''; as released by 
Brussels Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] The idea that exo-taxes might well be a way of 
reinvigorating growth is one that Ioannis Paleokrassas, the 
European Commissioner for the Environment, is hoping will figure 
quite prominently in the [EC] Commission's White Paper on the 
theme of an overall strategy for growth, competitiveness and 
employment. In his contribution to the document, he will be 
handing in to EC Government leaders at the end of the year, he 
champions a radically new resource-based system. This idea is 
favoured by a team of Commission experts, who have been 
considering these issues with an eye towards the White Paper: 
wage costs are twice as high as the net income of workers, 
whereas energy and investment taxes do not match the size of the 
increase. Present compulsory taxation systems are making it so 
much harder for European businesses to compete with their rivals 
and are having a serious affect on job prospects, so they need 
to be given a complete overhaul, claim the experts in their 
report. 
  Competitiveness, employment and the environment are three 
types of policies that ``might be neutral towards one another, 
they might be mutually reinforcing, and they may indeed be 
contradictory.'' For the likes of the Commission and the 
Presidency of the EC Council of Ministers, they stand a good 
chance of strengthening each other, but others only spot the 
potential conflicts. This issue already cropped up for 
discussion, albeit from a narrow point of view, in a 
Communication the Commission produced roughly a year ago on the 
theme of industrial competitiveness and the environment . 
  A working group made up of members of various Commission 
services, and orchestrated by the ``Forward studies unit'' 
(created by Jacques Delors), has been giving these matters some 
thought in the runup to a conference being organised by the 
Commission and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers on the 
theme of Forward towards a European model of sustainable 
development, on 9-10 November (at the Centre Borschette in 
Brussels) and the environment chapter in the White Paper, which 
has to be ready in time for the EC Summit on 10/11 December. The 
mid-term report drawn up by the group throws the spotlight on 
areas where EC action is vital to ensure 
employment/competitiveness and environmental protection 
stimulate each other. 
<H5>  Root-and-Branch Reform of Tax Systems </H5>
  The Commissioner wants to see environmental costs and 
benefits meshed in with macro- and micro-economic planning 
systems. Our labour and profit-based taxation systems ought to 
be changed to use resources and pollution as starting points, 
including soil utilisation taxes, the Commissioner believes, as 
``green taxes'' are the best means of integrating environmental 
factors into the economy. 
  He gives a few examples for guidance purposes: a landfill 
site eco-tax collected by the local authorities would make the 
comparative cost of incineration, recycling or re-use more 
realistic. Taxes on industrial output or profits could make way 
for charges on soil utilisation, emissions into the air or 
water. The present vehicle taxes stand back for emission-related 
road charges. Different eco-taxes on packaging could 
automatically lead to a reduction in the level of waste and 
boost the efficiency of waste processing. 
<H5>  Employment Overly Penalised </H5>
  Our present system ``penalises work and production,'' 
reckons 
the Commissioner, who feels that ``our social insurance systems 
are mostly obsolete, over-generous (...) and very expensive,'' 
while ``our tax system, and notably VAT, encourages the use of 
capital rather than labour.'' What is needed is a new 
development model based on the integration of the environment 
into our economic thinking. The Commissioner is persuaded that 
this new approach will make ``the environment our new locomotive 
for healthy growth.'' 
<H3>  Energy Saving in the Construction Industry: More Than 30 
Million Job-Years </H3>
  The Commissioner stresses the two separate roles of the 
environment strategy: 
  -- protective role: an effort to save or restore our 
environment, mainly through legislating, which may create 
additional jobs but can add to the costs of operating the 
economies. 
  -- active role: when action for the environment directly 
increases the competitiveness of our economies and products. The 
action may also create jobs in certain circumstances (but not 
always). Accordingly, the introduction of a a carbon energy tax 
does not especially create jobs in the short run, but an energy 
saving programme in the building industry can generate between 
24 and 34 million job-years over the next few years, underscores 
the EC Commissioner. 
<H5>  Energy/CO2 Tax Could Maximise Employment Potential </H5>
  Although the Commissioner does not believe that the 
introduction of a CO2/energy tax will create jobs in the short 
term, the ``inter-services group'' of the Commission emphasises, 
in its report, the economic benefits of the energy/CO2 tax, 
revenues from which, since it is ``neutral'' from an 
macro-economic point of view, could help to lower certain taxes 
which create large distortions (such as wage costs). The report 
stresses that, in calculating the effects of the tax, only the 
general reductions of other taxes (neutrality) were considered, 
and not a ``custom-made'' reduction aimed specifically at job 
creation. 
  Simulations have shown that application of the energy/CO2 
tax 
would have no effect, or a slightly positive effect, on 
employment. However, if the effects of the energy/CO2 tax were 
calculated with a concomitant basis of taxes affecting 
employment directly and specifically, the results could be much 
more positive. The key is the reduction in taxes which create 
large distortions in employment and competitivity in relation to 
the EC's rivals, the report notes. To create jobs in the short 
term, the report recommends using revenues from the tax to help 
industry to invest. 
<H5>  New Model of Development: Four Focuses </H5>
  The new model of development favoured by the Commission is 
based on four high-priority measures: 
  -- a rapid start to a programme of research into the 
economic 
implications of environmental measures, in order to assess the 
costs and benefits in terms of growth, employment and 
technological development, over both the short and longer term; 
  -- a re-orientation of tax systems (see above); 
  -- with the conclusion of a GATT agreement, the initiation 
of 
a new ``green'' round of negotiations on environmental and 
cultural dumping; 
  -- extensive research into and implementation of an action 
programme for radical change to the urban environment. 
<H5>  Community Action Essential </H5>
  In the opinion of the inter-services group, the key to 
increasing employment and improving competitivity within the 
framework of sustainable development lies first in a total 
reform of the structure and operation of social security 
systems. The group identified five areas for which Community 
action is necessary and would be effective: 
  -- as a top priority, the group chose eco-taxes, which would 
facilitate sharp reductions in taxes that create distortions and 
have a negative effect on employment and competitivity. Using 
environmental taxes has the advantage of influencing millions of 
consumers and firms without entailing costly administrative 
charges. 
  -- provision of information to increase Europeans' awareness 
of the issue of ``sustainability.'' The Community is well placed 
to promote debate, inform and encourage cooperation. 
  -- restoration of sites suffering environmental damage, to 
rectify the errors of the past and prevent future pollution, 
with the help of new technologies (creation of jobs). 
  -- The Community must orient its research and sectorial 
policies towards sustainable development. 
  -- The Community should encourage a basic debate on 
lifestyles in Europe and ways of changing them (in terms of 
flexibility of working hours, time management and use of 
transport). Such societal changes could have positive 
consequences for sustainable models of socio- economic 
development (which could in turn increase employment).

<F P=106> [Article by Pauli Andersen: ``EC Environmental Headquarters </F>
Ready in Spring''--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE TIDENDE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Property next to Denmark's Environmental Researches 
in Roskilde has been designated as the site of the EC's 
environment agency. Project building plans are ready and the 
agency's management team has been selected. 
  After many years' tug-of-war between the EC nations, the 
Council of Ministers has now decided that Denmark is to play 
host to the EC's environmental agency. 
  Denmark has prepared itself thoroughly to be the host of the 
new EC institution. Therefore, it is expected that the office 
can open as early as next spring. The environmental agency and 
the city of Roskilde have prepared the way for locating the 
office beside Denmark's Environmental Researches in Roskilde. 
<H5>  Building Plans Are Ready </H5>
  The plans for the building are already worked out and the 
director of Denmark's Environmental Researches, Henrik Sandbech, 
is prepared to help get the agency on its feet. Sandbech has 
been appointed the Danish member of the agency's management team. 
  The new EC office will gather information on the quality of 
the environment in various EC countries. This will provide 
politicians background with which to evaluate which regions 
should receive priority in getting environmental help. 
  ``The agency will be an institution independent of the 
political system. Regulations regarding the agency's functions 
have been approved, so now we are simply waiting to begin 
operations,'' said Sandbech. 
<H5>  Influx to Roskilde </H5>
  In Roskilde, the district is engaged in an all-out 
cooperative effort together with the local trade development 
council to find housing for the incoming employees. 
  ``We expect that the environmental agency will attract many 
new businesses to Roskilde. This includes EDP [electronic data 
processing] businesses and naturally businesses that deal with 
environmental issues,'' said Kim Valbum, director of the 
Roskilde Area Trade Development Council. 
  On the national level, the placement of the agency in 
Denmark 
is seen as a sign that Denmark is on the leading edge when it 
comes to protection of the environment.

<F P=106> [Article including interview with former Environment </F>
Minister Per Stig Moller by Steensgaard; place and date of 
interview not given: ``They Have Never Seen Anything Like It in 
the Ministry''--first paragraph is BERLINGSKE AFTEN introduction] 
  [Text] ``Only afterwards is one truly free,'' said Per Stig 
Moller. After his two years as environment minister, he is 
lashing out at environmental doomsday prophets and their 
alarmist movements. Growth is the way forward, we must not run 
screaming backwards. Yet another provocative book from a 
nonsocialist former minister. 
  First, Anders Fogh Rasmussen hurled his angry, 
uncompromising 
book about the Danish society of grumblers and whimperers onto 
the table. Now, another former minister, Per Stig Moller, has 
put some weighty ideas into print. The 51-year-old Ph.D. and 
gifted humanist writer was the nonsocialist government's last 
environment minister--in 1991 and 1992--and he cannot forget it. 
  ``I sat at my desk during Easter, some months after the 
government was out of power,'' he said. ``There were no papers, 
no matters to be taken care of, no ringing telephones. Being a 
minister is like being on drugs, you work from 0800 in the 
morning to 2200 at night, every day of the week. You suffer 
withdrawal afterwards. I thought: I can't stand this, I will 
write a book! 
  ``A minister cannot do this because then the prime minister 
and the whole government must be agreed upon your point of view. 
You might as well be writing the party platform. Only afterwards 
is one truly free. So it is tempting, as Anders and I have done, 
to lean back and focus all of one's personal knowledge on 
setting things into perspective.'' 
  Moller has an agreeable manner of boasting. He does not try 
to conceal his compliments to himself behind something else. 
They come out with a bang. He manifests an unabashed joy in his 
initiatives--''they never saw anything like it at the 
ministry``--in his industry, in his results. He can say 
`dialectic' and other nonendemic words without blinking and 
quotes French philosophers in French. People at Christiansborg 
say this has always been his problem in Danish politics, that he 
thinks--in this way. An unusual man of affairs.'' 
  Today he has nothing to do with environmental policy, as the 
Conservative Party has decided that everyone is to change 
places. ``We have seen for ourselves how our predecessors came 
to appear either lax or pathetic, if they remained within their 
ministerial area,'' he said. ``If they were critical, it was 
labeled bitterness. If they supported the new ministers, it was 
insipid. It hurt them as politicians.'' 
<H5>  Ecologists and Nazis </H5>
  One of Mollers important objectives in the book is to shoot 
down the so-called ecohumanists, who condemn growth. It is not 
only that he disagrees with their desire for minus growth. He is 
also afraid that some of them will begin to tamper with 
democracy in the name of the environment. He worries they will 
brush aside democracy as too weak to do anything effective about 
the looming catastrophes. 
  Among Moller's ecohumanists is found the poet, Thorkild 
Bjornvig. In the 1970's, he began a campaign against 
industrialism, capitalism, market economics, and democracy, 
Moller says. Bjornvig rejected the democracies ``with their 
antiquated materialistic concepts of freedom'' and espoused 
ecological socialism. 
  This pessimistic line was taken up by David Rehling, 
director 
of Denmark's Nature Conservancy Association, who last year in a 
feature article criticized democracy's incapacity to act. Knud 
Vilby, chairman of International Cooperation, is also counted 
among the group. Moller cites him for wanting to use 
``consciousness-raising'' to save the earth. And, for those 
people who are unable to raise their consciousness, he would use 
``the force that is necessary to get the last ones to go along.'' 
  ``The ecohumanists imagine that they are angels who have 
seen 
the ethically correct path. That we must abandon growth and clad 
ourselves in sackcloth and ashes,'' says Moller. ``Yet if 
poverty were to come, people would not put money into nature, 
they would want social programs instead. The East Germans, who 
have the biggest environmental problems, give the environment 
lowest priority. West Germans, who have the fewest problems, 
give it the highest priority. This is an excellent argument for 
concurrent growth and environmental policy, for only when you 
have the funds, do you have the means to look around and view 
your surroundings.'' 
  Steensgaard: Aren't you seeing phantoms? Not a 
single society is run by the ecohumanists you warn about. 
  Moller: They are few, but they color political 
life--also here in Denmark. In my time as minister, the Social 
Democrats, Radicals, and Socialist People's Party, during an 
inquiry debate, proposed that growth should be stopped. Jan 
Sjursen of the Christian Party is out there right now with very 
much the same kind of thing, in which he says that we have 
enough growth and should slow down our pace. Politicians do not 
act in a vacuum. The humanists create the mental imagery, the 
expectations, and the doom. The Nazi gas chambers did not come 
from the technicians, but from racial conceptions, which came 
out of philosophy, God help us. 
<H5>  Fear Is the Engine </H5>
  Steensgaard: Is ecology suitable as a new ideology 
for all those who are searching for one? 
  Moller: Yes. Ecology is a modern expression for 
nature worship and some would use it politically. The power they 
did not achieve over society by means of Marxism and socialistic 
theories, they can achieve through ecology. The engine is fear 
of catastrophe. 
  In his book, Moller writes that environmental catastrophe 
has 
become an issue that mystics and demagogues can use to draw 
people in. Now that the cold war is over and the ideologies have 
collapsed, we are immediately able to make another: The old 
confrontation between capitalism and Marxism has been supplanted 
by something between liberalism and ecologism. Just as in the 
1970's, the Marxists sought to win control over production and 
gain supremacy over bourgeois democracy with the object of 
creating a socialist egalitarian society, in the 1990's, the 
ecologists aspire to do the same. The goal has simply been 
changed, in this case, to a ``balanced'' society. 
  One of the worst, in the opinion of the former minister, is 
the German-American religious philosopher, Hans Jonas, who is 
influential in ecology circles. 
  ``Jonas says that those who understand what this is all 
about 
must halt growth. This elite will determine what will be 
produced and make sure that it is distributed. Democracy is then 
abolished and a big threat provides the means to do it: The end 
of the world. In such circumstances, it is a small thing to 
abolish democracy. Fear is a prop. It paralyzes people and 
causes them to buy indulgences from the environmental 
organizations. 
  ``At the other end, you have the right-wing ecologists. They 
never did like growth and feel that industrialism destroys the 
soul. They would lead us back to a time of self-reliant 
households, ancient virtues, and a life without haste or hurry. 
It is a longing for continuity. They would stop time.'' 
  ``The middle, in which I find myself, does not wish to offer 
up democracy on ecology's alter. My point is that those who have 
acquired absolute power to solve a problem have damn well never 
done it! They have created even greater problems, but in the 
meantime they entrenched themselves pretty well. There are no 
extreme solutions.'' 
<H5>  The End of the World </H5>
  Moller is neither more or less extreme than a Radical 
Liberal 
minister or a Social Democratic one. They are surprisingly 
united in their concrete policy. Why go to the bother of writing 
a book when they are all in agreement? 
  ``It is quite irrelevant whether we are agreed or not, as 
the 
others have not set down their ideas comprehensively. This is 
the first environmental book in Danish that was not written by a 
Green. I try to view the environment humanistically, 
historically, culturally, and technologically. There are hard, 
concrete chapters and also historical ones--for example the one 
on doomsday prophets. That one was fun to write!'' 
  Steensgaard: You poke fun at doomsday prophets 
from the past, in that each maintained that the end was drawing 
nigh. Yet, you yourself say that about our situation.... 
  Moller: Yes, I am saying: They have been wrong so 
many times. This is my message about what we presently know. A 
colossal number of catastrophes are waiting out there. We have 
never had so many that dovetailed into one another. They must be 
solved generally in the same time frame with different solutions 
that point in the same direction. It is something mankind has 
never before encountered, because it is the first time the 
catastrophes have been global. 
  Steensgaard: Where shall we begin when there are 
so many catastrophes to choose between? 
  Moller: In Denmark, our three greatest problems 
are: too much waste, a question of adequate ground water, and a 
lack of knowledge. We simply do not know enough about how nature 
reacts. Globally, the irreplaceable things must be dealt with 
first. That is, those things that cannot be restored again: 
climate changes, the hole in the ozone layer, and the fact that 
whole species of plants and animals are vanishing. But, above 
all this hangs the biggest problem of all: the threat of 
overpopulation. You can go around and solve all of the other 
environmental problems one after the other--it will not help one 
bit if you do not at the same time tackle the problem of 
overpopulation. 
  Steensgaard: The world's biggest environmental 
problem--that is the others? 
  Moller: The Third World is very frightened of our 
ecoimperialism. The fact that we come to them and say: You must 
fix the rain forest. You must not cut the few trees that prevent 
the desert from expanding--sure, thanks for the advice. But then 
they cannot survive. Consequently, it is necessary for both 
parties to understand that they are the ones doing injury. The 
Third World may not lean back and say: You have created all of 
the environmental problems, as you use 40 times as much energy 
as we do. It is you who are overpopulated. 
  There is no reason for the rich countries to be too 
complacent, Moller feels. We put major hindrances in the way of 
the poor in every possible way: We invent fanciful trade 
barriers to keep their goods out. We demand huge sums in 
interest and fees on loans. And we shut our labor market off so 
that they cannot come up here and earn money to live on. There 
is no sign that things are moving in the right direction. 
  That is the most disheartening thing. We bring home more 
money from the poor nations in interest on loans than we send 
down there. The GATT negotiations are still not successful, and 
with all our trade barriers, we chain them to poverty. The West 
still does not give even 1 percent of its money to the 
developing nations. But the fact is we have a choice: Either we 
purchase their goods, or else, we will need to employ them here, 
and that is something we do not desire either. My joyous message 
is that it is permissible to produce so as to promote growth, 
but not to pollute. And that is something the Third World must 
be part of.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Paul Dufour: ``Nuclear Waste Storage No </F>
Longer Causes Fear''] 
  [Text] Construction of underground laboratories 
involves mediation. 
  ``There has been a complete reversal of direction. People 
have abandoned the logic of refusal in favor of the assault of 
enticement,'' says Christian Bataille, deputy (PS [Socialist 
Party]) for Nord Department, who does not yet know whether he 
should be pleased or worried about this development. When 
Bataille arrived in Gard--the most heavily nuclearized 
department in France (Footnote 1. In particular, Gard is the 
site of the Marcoule center, the Eurodif [European Dissemination 
Agency] uranium enrichment plant, and the Phoenix breeder 
reactor)--he certainly did not expect to encounter much 
opposition on his mission of mediation with respect to the 
construction of underground laboratories for the management of 
high-level radioactive waste. But if you recall the disturbances 
that this issue caused in January 1990 in Vendee, it is indeed 
surprising to see a region almost unanimously--and with such 
conviction--clamoring for ``its'' waste. 
  Appointed to the post of mediator by Pierre Beregovoy and 
retained in that capacity by Edouard Balladur, Bataille is 
charged with a very precise mission: that of ``de-emotionalizing 
the debate.'' Aided by the crisis and the unemployment 
situation, his task could indeed prove less difficult than 
anticipated. After visiting Gard Department on 7 and 8 October, 
he went to Marne on 19 October and Haute-Marne on 21 and 22 
October. The elected officials--who had invited him ``to obtain 
information''--are now telling the mediation delegation that 
they hope to reinforce the candidacies of their respective 
departments. And although some associations and some elected 
officials of the Greens have expressed their opposition and 
reservations, they did so calmly, Bataille said, ``after having 
heard--sometimes at great length--the arguments of the mediator, 
who for his part took their positions into consideration.'' 
  For the time being, the Bataille mission constitutes the 
final chapter in a story that began in 1983. Charged with 
conducting the studies looking toward the construction of an 
underground storage center for long-life, high-level radioactive 
waste, the National Agency for the Management of Radioactive 
Waste (ANDRA) selected--amid the greatest secrecy--a total of 28 
favorable geologic sites. Of that total, Alain Madelin--who was 
serving as minister of industry--four years later chose four 
sites that corresponded to the four most suitable geologic 
formations: Neuvy-Bouin (Deux-Sevres) for granite; Le 
Bourg-d'Ire (Maine-et-Loire) for shale; 
Montcornet-Sissonne-en-Bresse (Aisne) for clay; and Montrevel 
(Ain) for salt. The geologists are charged with selecting the 
two ``finalists'' from among these four. 
  At the respective sites, however, the geologists had to 
confront resolute opposition from the local populations and even 
veritable riots such as occurred at Bourg-d'Ire (LE MONDE, 30 
January 1990). On 9 February 1990, Prime Minister Michel Rocard 
therefore ordered a moratorium ``of at least one year.'' 
Christian Bataille, deputy and vice president of the Regional 
Council of Nord Department, was charged with drafting a report 
that served as the basis of the law of 30 December 1991 
``relating to the research on the management of radioactive 
waste'' which sets forth the French position on this issue (see 
box). 
<H5>  Approximately Thirty Candidacies </H5>
  Gard was the first of 15 departments that Bataille will 
visit 
before submitting his recommendations in mid-December to 
Minister of Industry, Posts, Telecommunications, and Foreign 
Trade Gerard Longuet, representing 15 sites chosen from 
approximately 30 spontaneous applications. ``Just one article in 
the GAZETTE DES COMMUNES brought in 20 applications,'' said a 
member of his team, still astonished at this unexpected success. 
Sites where the substratum was clearly unsuitable were obviously 
ruled out as a matter of course. All of the other sites will in 
principle be visited by the mediator. 
  Bataille's coming was widely announced in the press and by 
personal letter to every person (pronuclear and antinuclear 
alike) of influence in the region. Once he was installed ``on 
neutral ground'' in the prefecture, the mediator received 
whoever had submitted an application--elected officials, labor 
union members, officials of associations, or even private 
citizens--provided they had a local constituency of some 
consequence. He then discussed the various points in the 
dossier, answered questions, and collected the opinions and 
positions of each person. 
  During two days in Nimes, for example, Bataille met with at 
least 40 persons, only one of whom--Marie-Anne Sabatier 
(Greens), a member of the Regional Council--voiced strong 
opposition to the plan. On the other hand, elected officials of 
all tendencies--and the presidents of the commercial tribunals 
and employer organizations--explained how important the plan 
would be for the economy of the region. Even more unexpected was 
the fact that the environmental protection associations limited 
themselves to demanding ``the most complete openness,'' 
believing--in essence--that such a laboratory would create jobs 
without aggravating the pollution in a region that is already 
highly nuclearized. The winegrowers--who are used to 
expropriations resulting from urban or industrial 
development--hinted to the mediator that if the scales were 
tipped slightly to redefine the boundaries of the control areas 
on which trade names are based, they would regard it as an 
acceptable trade-off. 
  Christian Bataille does not, of course, expect to receive 
the 
same welcome everywhere. ``Some applications come from a single 
mayor, or even from a member of a municipal council of a small 
municipality,'' he acknowledges. In such cases, the prefect 
Jacques Monestier, director of the team that is assisting 
Bataille, acts as an advance man to ``reconnoiter the terrain'' 
and unofficially establish contacts capable of enlarging the 
support base for a request that comes from too limited a source. 
``Obviously,'' Monestier says, ``it is impossible for us to 
leave immediately with the mediator in response, for example, to 
the request of a single mayor of a municipality consisting of 65 
residents. But,'' he smilingly adds, ``if that small village 
sits astride a magnificent dome of granite, nothing prevents us 
from contacting other elected officials and attempting to reach 
an agreement....'' 
<H5>  ``Buying Consciences?'' </H5>
  It is all suggestions and advice, however. There is no 
attempt to force anyone's hand. In any case, the mediator does 
not go anywhere unless invited. The only exception to this 
golden rule is the four sites chosen previously by Alain 
Madelin. Bataille insists that the purpose of the visits is ``to 
determine the current state of mind of the local population and 
present the new points in a dossier that has evolved 
considerably.'' Where the opposition is too strong, the visit 
can be replaced by a simple interview in Paris with elected 
local officials. ``If there are any tensions, they will not 
originate with us,'' the mediator emphasizes. ``Let the 
opponents be reassured: there are plenty of candidacies.'' 
  It is true that in these times of crisis the offer is 
somewhat seductive. Each of the two laboratories will represent 
an investment of at least Fr1.5 billion--plus Fr70 million per 
year of operation--and will provide 150 jobs ``with priority 
being given to job applications from local residents.'' ANDRA 
will also participate--to the extent of Fr60 million per 
year--in the financing of ``project realizations and supporting 
actions.'' This largesse will be managed by a public interest 
group (GIP) that brings together--alongside the state and 
ANDRA--the region, the department, and all the municipalities 
situated less than 10 km from the site. 
  ``It is not a question of buying consciences,'' Christian 
Bataille counters. ``Anyway, what does Fr60 million represent? 
Scarcely five km of freeway constructed on a level surface. Most 
of the candidacies submitted are more farsighted and are based 
on a nobler logic of overall economic development.'' 
<H5>  ``A Scientific History'' </H5>
  This is obviously true in the case of Gard Department where, 
with the projected closing--in 1998--of the unit for the 
reprocessing of fuels from UP1 graphite-gas power plants, 
several hundred jobs will disappear from the Marcoule site, 
despite the start-up of the Melox plant in early 1995. Gilbert 
Baumet, president of the general council, emphasizes that ``for 
the Rhone district of Gard Department, Marcoule is somewhat the 
equivalent of Renault.'' The site currently employs more than 
3,000 persons, not counting the jobs in related industries. The 
labor unions sent a form letter to the elected officials--and to 
the executives of the commercial and employer 
organizations--requesting that they support Gard's candidacy in 
negotiations with the mediation mission. They explained to 
Christian Bataille that the Marcoule site ``possesses an 
infrastructure--and a scientific and technical history--that are 
propitious for siting the project here.'' 
  Some university professors pointed to the existence nearby 
(at Montpellier) of university and CNRS [National Council for 
Scientific Research] laboratories--``especially those in the 
field of the earth sciences''--that are ready to participate in 
the research. Business executives cited the talent available at 
a local school for training engineers in the field of computer 
science, and most of them said quite frankly that in addition to 
the laboratory, they hope in fact to obtain the storage center 
properly speaking. ``Gard was the first department to accept a 
nuclear installation, in 1954,'' Gilbert Beaumet pointed out. 
``It truly deserves to have the nation return the favor.'' It 
was an opinion that the mediator seemed to share, when he 
acknowledged that ``your social and human conditions make a good 
case for this department.'' It remains for the geologists to 
substantiate this favorable impression at the technical level. 
<H5>  [Box, p 18] </H5>
<H5>  Fifteen Years of Research </H5>
  The law of 30 December 1991 defined with precision all the 
stages that will lead to the selection of a site for the deep 
underground storage of long-life, high level nuclear waste. 
  The mediator, Christian Bataille, was initially assigned the 
task of conducting the dialogue leading to the selection of the 
sites where preliminary work on construction of an underground 
laboratory can be carried out. In December, Bataille will submit 
a number of conclusions on the basis of which the government 
will select two sites. 
  At the conclusion of the two years of preliminary work 
(extensive geological investigations), two underground 
laboratories will be dug to a depth of from 200 to 1,000 meters, 
depending on the nature of the sites. This work will continue 
for five years. The scientists will then be able to set up shop 
there for eight years of research with the aim of verifying the 
behavior of the rocks. These laboratories will not receive any 
waste, although a few small sources or samples necessary for the 
experiments will be able to be lowered to the laboratories. 
Simultaneously, other research will be carried out in two 
complementary directions: reduction of the volume and life of 
the waste, and procedures for conditioning the waste with a view 
to possible future long-term surface storage. 
  Finally, around the year 2006, Parliament will decide--on 
the 
basis of the results obtained--whether to pursue the research or 
to decide on a method of managing the waste, which could be to 
bury them underground. 
  A center will then be dug, probably--but not 
necessarily--near one of the laboratories. Because the 
laboratories will have only one access well and a few galleries, 
they themselves cannot be converted into storage centers, which 
would have to be much larger: in fact, veritable underground 
cathedrals. 
  The storage of waste in these centers will be reversible, so 
that the waste can be recovered if scientific progress permits 
its elimination in a more ecological manner.

<F P=106> [Article by M.C.: ``Renault Creates First European `Green </F>
Network'''; introductory paragraph in boldface as published] 
  [Text] Like several European--particularly Swedish 
and German--manufacturers, Renault and Peugeot are developing 
their systems for collecting and recycling automobile scrap. 
Renault is completing installation of the first European ``green 
network,'' while Peugeot is starting a pilot operation in the 
Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region. 
  Renault is completing the installation in 10 West European 
countries of its ``green network,'' a system for collecting and 
recycling automobile scrap. From Swindon in Great Britain to 
Vienna in Austria and from Amsterdam to Lisbon by way of Paris, 
Brussels, or Milan, beginning in 1994, 1 million bumpers, 
700,000 batteries, 3 million liters of solvents, 3 million 
tires, and 120,000 cubic meters of used packaging will be 
collected every year and then ``reworked'' (that is, transformed 
into new raw materials) by recycling professionals. 
  The network, which got its start in the Tours area and in 
Germany in the summer of 1991, has already made it possible, for 
example, to use some 120,000 used bumpers to manufacture new 
parts (fenders and side bumpers) for the latest Safrane, Clio, 
and Twingo models. The system will involve the 13,500 dealers 
and agents in Renault's European sales network. From every sales 
outlet and repair point, the same trucks that deliver new 
replacement parts will carry away automobile scrap to regional 
or national collection centers (for example, Zurich for 
Switzerland and Valladolid for Spain). There the scrap will be 
sorted and the resulting inventories in each category sent to 
certified recycling firms. 
  In cooperation with the French Scrap Iron Company, Renault 
also set up the first industrial center for processing junked 
automobiles in Athis-Mons (Essonne) in September 1992. In one 
year, that plant has recycled some 10,000 vehicles with what the 
firm reports is ``a salvage rate exceeding 90 percent'' and good 
economic profitability. In less than 10 years, ``no more than 10 
percent'' of the weight of a vehicle will wind up in dumps, 
compared to 25 percent today. In addition to its existing 
centers (in Athis-Mons, Madrid, and Wuerzburg, Germany), Renault 
intends to establish new ones--notably in Toulouse. Some of them 
will be operated in cooperation with other manufacturers, as is 
already the case with BMW in Wuerzburg. 
<H5>  Peugeot's `Clean Garages' </H5>
  On a smaller scale, Peugeot is also concerning itself with 
the collection of automobile scrap (oil, batteries, and tires). 
In cooperation with the National Council of Automobile 
Professionals (CNPA), the firm in Sochaux has just launched a 
pilot experiment in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region: car owners 
who maintain their own vehicles are being encouraged to bring 
their used materials to facilities equipped for the purpose 
(there will be 40 such establishments by the end of the year, 
plus another 200 in 1994). The used materials will then be sent 
to recycling centers. If the experiment is successful, the 
system will be extended to all of France. 
  Parallel with that, Peugeot is engaged in a ``clean garage'' 
operation following what the manufacturer calls ``successful'' 
testing since December 1992 by its dealer in Douai (Nord). This 
operation consists of sorting shop scrap at the source for 
subsequent recycling. 
  Will the consumer find his garage bill increasing to serve 
the ``green cause?'' Renault rules out that possibility, at 
least ``in the short term.'' Peugeot is reportedly considering 
the possibility of an ``environment fee'' in the name of 
``modern-day public-spiritedness.'' The reason, according to 
Peugeot and the CNPA, is that every year in France, 100,000 
metric tons of used motor oil, 2 million batteries, and 15 
million tires are thrown away, all too often in unauthorized 
dumps. Compare those figures to the current effort.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Pierre Gaudard: ``Environment: New Decree </F>
to Be Published Next Month; Used-Oil Recovery Network Being Set 
Up''--first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction] 
  [Text] Industrial waste specialists could find new markets. 
But the collection system must be revised, and treating 
processes evaluated. 
  It is now a certainty: Eco-Oils, the consortium that manages 
the used-lubricant recovery system, will be ready to start 
operating on 1 March 1994, when the former public system 
financed by an additional levy will be terminated. 
  The founders of Eco-Oils, oil companies and independent 
lubricant manufacturers, have already hired the man who will 
head the organization, a manager from Elf, and they have chosen 
premises near those of the Lubricants Professional Committee, in 
Rueil-Malmaison (Hauts-de-Seine). 
  The decree reorganizing the oil-recovery system, which was 
the subject of intense negotiations between professionals and 
the Environment Ministry, should be published in October. 
Contrary to a recommendation of the Pietrasanta report that was 
submitted to the environment minister last December, the 
incorporation of regenerated oil into lubricants will not become 
mandatory. The additional levy on lubricant stock produced or 
imported in France (currently 150 francs [Fr] per ton) will be 
replaced by a voluntary contribution from ``producers'' (whether 
manufacturers of importers) who will be responsible for what 
happens to their products. Eco-Oils will probably be the only 
organization, but it will not have a formal monopoly because, in 
theory, everyone has the right to collect its own waste. With a 
budget of close to Fr150 million, the consortium will sign 
procurement contracts with organizations collecting used oil, 
and supply contracts with organizations eliminating them. 
  Will the recasting of the system make it possible for the 
oil-recovery network to get out of bankruptcy? Everybody hopes 
so. For the past two years, the crisis has kept getting worse. 
The expansion of the collection system (the quantities collected 
rose from 89,000 tons in 1986 to 173,000 tons in 1992) does not 
make it possible to lower costs, which are estimated to be about 
Fr500 per ton. At the same time, aging, technological 
obsolescence, and falling new-oil prices (due to falling 
crude-oil prices) proved fatal for regeneration units. 
  Two of them, UFP [expansion not given] (in Lorraine) and 
Solunor (in the Nord), closed down last year. The last plant, 
CBL [expansion not given], in Seine-Maritime, has been reprieved 
and survives only by not paying anything for used oil. 
Overhauling it would require an investment of about Fr300 
million, but the unit may be doomed because the process it uses 
produces tar-containing acid waste. 
  The reorganization of the collection system, therefore, does 
not solve all the problems. Simultaneously with the setting up 
of Eco-Oils, the ADEME [Environment and Energy Management 
Agency] will order an economic and ecological audit to evaluate 
various processes of regeneration, energy upgrading (in cement 
works, EDF [French Electric Power Company] power plants, in 
fluidized beds with CDF [French Coal Mines]), or recycling in 
refineries (as catalytic cracker feed or heavy fuel-oil 
component). This study is causing quite a stir in the small 
eco-business world, as the Batelle group, through an offer said 
to be much less costly, hopes to break down the pre-eminence of 
the Eco-Bilans company on the French market. 
  The possible construction of an oil-regeneration plant, 
which 
might aim to reprocess French lubricants and lubricants from 
some neighboring markets, will be the occasion of some more 
tough dealing. This time, the competitors will be major 
industrial-waste processing companies and the U.S. company Waste 
Management; the latter's reprocessing plants, which use vacuum 
distillation technology, have already caught the interest of 
French technicians.

  [Text] Paris, Nov 24 (AFP) -- A Greenpeace delegation left 
300 grams (about 10 oz) of highly toxic waste outside the New 
Zealand embassy here on Wednesday in a protest about French 
plans to import 500 tonnes of New Zealand PCBs for incineration 
in France. 
  New Zealand does not have the equipment to destroy the PCBs, 
which are used as an insulator in electricity transformers, and 
French Environment Minister Michel Barnier says France has 
agreed to import the chemical out of ``ecological solidarity.'' 
  The French branch of the environmental organisation said on 
Wednesday that there were thousands of PCB transformers in 
France that needed to be processed as a priority. 
  The PCBs are incinerated at a plant operated by the 
state-owned Tredi group in south-eastern France. Incineration 
produces a highly toxic residue, a sample of which was left at 
the New Zealand embassy on Wednesday. 
  Greenpeace said the imports from New Zealand ``will in no 
way 
solve the growing problem of New Zealand's toxic wastes.'' 
Greenpeace last year vainly campaigned aginst French imports of 
another 500 tonnes of PCBs from Australia.

  [Text] Marseille, Dec 1 (AFP) -- Six Greenpeace militants 
scaled a nuclear reactor cooling tower on Wednesday in protest 
against an experimental reactor meltdown planned for Thursday. 
  The six, two Germans, two French and two Belgians, broke 
into 
the Cadarache Nuclear Test Centre near here at dawn. Carrying 
geiger counters, they draped banners from the top of the cooling 
tower reading: ``Atomic experiment don't play with our lives.'' 
  Penelope Komites, head of Greenpeace France, denounced the 
experiment because of the presence of numerous other nuclear 
installations at Cadarache and because of ``major seismic 
risks.'' 
  The experiment, to be carried out in a PHEBUS reactor, will 
simulate on a small scale a meltdown in the heart of a 
pressurised water reactor -- the type most frequently in service 
in the west -- and is aimed at increasing security. 
  Komites said the experiment should be called off because it 
would provide a ``false sense of security'' over serious nuclear 
accidents. 
  Scientists and ecologists will be able to watch the 
experiment live by teletransmission either at Cadarache or at 
Fontenay-aux- Roses, in the eastern Paris suburbs, home of 
France's Nuclear Safety and Protection Institute (IPSN), which 
is organising the meltdown. 
  On Tuesday, 20 militants of the Austrian ecological group 
Global 2000 demonstrated outside the French embassy in Vienna, 
saying there was a ``considerable risk'' that radioactive 
materials would leak during the experiment ``which has no 
meaning and exposes the people of France, Europe and the 
wholeworld to pointless nuclear danger.'' 
  The Cadarache experiment began on November 21 with pre- 
irradiation of 10 kilogrammes (22 lbs) of nuclear fuel and is 
the first of six simulations costing a total of 150 million 
dollars. 
  The French electricity utility EDF is paying 25 percent of 
the programme, the European Community 30 percent and the United 
States, Canada, Japan and South Korea are contributing 15 
percent. 
  The first experiment was to have been carried out last 
summer 
but was delayed after metal shavings were found from a hole that 
had been drilled in a seal support. 
  In October, a bolt dropped out of a heat measuring 
mechanism, 
causing another delay. 
  But Cadarache director Michel Suscillon says there was no 
danger. ``Even in the case of a failure during the experiment, 
the radioactive products will stay confined behind four 
impermeable barriers.'' 
  Greenpeace-Germany has spearheaded the campaign against the 
experiment, campaigning for a tourist boycott of the Provence 
region in southern France and prompting major tour operator 
Turistik Union International (TUI) to join in. 
  Half of the students of a German high school dropped out of 
an exchange programme with a French secondary school.

<F P=106> [``me''-initialed report: ``Franco-German Sarcophagus for </F>
Chernobyl Reactor?''] 
  [Text] Wiesbaden, 1 Dec -- In the view of Federal 
Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer, of the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU], Germany and France should, together, build a new 
sarcophagus for the disaster nuclear reactor in Chernobyl. On 
Wednesday, Toepfer said in Wiesbaden that this issue was 
discussed in the Franco-German consultations. The concrete 
coat, which was built around the reactor after the disaster in 
Ukraine, now has to be overhauled due to erosion processes. 
According to Toepfer, several pending questions (such as that 
of financing) still have to be clarified before a concrete 
decision is taken. 
  In an event organized by the Konrad-Adenauer-Foundation, 
which is close to the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], Toepfer 
predicted that the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] 
would change its policy and support an energy consensus with the 
inclusion of nuclear energy after the Bundestag election.

<F P=106> [Article by Renate Ell: ``Metalworks spew out dioxin''] </F>
  [Text] 
<H3>  Experience in Bremen Shows That Plants on the Rhine and Ruhr 
Could Also Be Cleaned Up </H3>
  Not all plants in Germany from whose chimneys dioxins stream 
into the environment are equal before the law. Whilst the 
Emmission Control Order imposes a limit of 0.1 nanograms 
(millionth of a gram) per cubic meter of waste gas on garbage 
incineration plants, there are no such rules for other thermal 
plants such as steel, nonferrous metal or aluminum works. But a 
single metalworks can emit as great a quantity of dioxins as 
several garbage incinerators combined. 
  Dioxins build up in the environment because these 
chlorinated 
hydrocarbon composites are very hardly degradable, some of them 
almost completely nondegradable. They also enter the human body 
via the food chain. TCDD [expansion not provided], often called 
Seveso dioxin, is the best researched and at the same time the 
most toxic of the total of 120 different dioxins. It is 
therefore used as a reference: The total quantity of dioxins 
and the very similar furanes in a sample is stated in toxicity 
equivalents (TEQ) and TCDD. 
  All dioxins have proved toxic in animal experiments and 
caused cancer and mutations in offspring. The effects on man 
are known mainly from examinations of the population of Seveso, 
chemical industry workers, and Vietnam veterans (the defoliant 
Agent Orange was contaminated with dioxins). Dioxins and 
furanes occur as unwanted byproducts of reactions involving 
chlorine, chiefly in thermal processes such as garbage 
incineration or metal smelting. The contaminants are mainly 
bound to dust particles. 
  There is at present little data available on dioxin 
emissions 
from metallurgical plants. In recent weeks and months 
discussion has centered mainly round steel sintering plants, for 
which the Environment Ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia 
undertook a measuring program last year. 
  Sintering plants prepare ore dust for the blast furnace by 
heating it to 1200 to 1300 degrees together with coke slack, 
lime, and other additives. At the same time, sintering plants 
are also used to recycle a wide variety of iron-containing 
materials, so- called ``metallurgist's residues,'' which make up 
as much as 30 percent of the sinter mass. But apart from iron 
and other metals, these materials also contain a large number of 
other ingredients, including chlorine and hydrocarbons, creating 
the conditions for the production of dioxins, furanes, and other 
toxic chlorinated hydrocarbons. 
  Dioxin concentrations of three to five nanograms TEQ per 
cubic meter gas were measured in the waste gas from sintering 
plants. This does not look so shocking at first sight as some 
garbage incineration plants are also still in this range 
(although about one half of Germany's 40 plants do now keep 
within the 0.1 nanogram limit). What makes sintering plants 
probably the largest single source of dioxins among thermal 
installations is their high volume of waste gas: About 10 
million cubic meters per hour for all German sintering plants 
taken together. (By comparison, the total waste gas output of 
all German garbage incineration plants is in the region of 2 
million cubic meters.) Thus, German sintering plants give off a 
total of 200 to 400 grams TEQ dioxins every year. According to 
environment minister Matthiesen, Krupp-Hoesch Stahl AG's 
Westphalia works in Dortmund alone gives off 250 grams of dioxin 
a year. Matthiesen says that the waste gas from the Duisburg 
copper plant also contains extremely high concentrations of the 
Seveso poison and in the hot briquetting plant of the Duisburg 
firm Berzelius Metalworks GmbH peaks of as much as 70 nanograms 
per cubic meter of air are reached. 
<H5>  Disposal Bottleneck </H5>
  The theoretically simplest solution to the sintering plant 
problem would be to keep recycled materials, or at least those 
containing chlorine, out of the plant. But what would be done 
with them then? There would immediately be a disposal 
bottleneck. But in the long term finding alternative means of 
disposing of some of these materials will be an important aspect 
of reducing sintering plant emissions. Krupp-Hoesch in Dortmund 
have already excluded a particularly suspect material from the 
sintering process. And North Rhine-Westphalia's Environment 
Ministry has instructed the labour inspectorate to issue 
regulations ensuring that no residues from other firms and no 
materials containing oil are added to the sinter mass. 
  The ministry and the firm are hoping that a measurement 
program in November, experimenting with other operating 
parameters, will give them more information. The authorities 
and the firm agree that the measurements currently available are 
insufficient to form a basis for further measures. Krupp-Hoesch 
also wants to improve the effectiveness of its electrostatic 
filter by means of so-called continuous precipitation 
electrodes, but these will not be ready for use until the end of 
1994. 
  They have got a lot further at Kloeckner's steel works in 
Bremen, where they have been successfully trying to reduce dust 
emissions for three years. With the financial support of the 
Federal Environment Office, the firm in August installed a 
fibrous filter, which has proved very promising, behind its 
electrostatic filter. The filter is like a sort of large nylon 
stocking which catches dust and ash. The fabric is coated to 
make it even more effective at collecting harmful substances: 
with activated carbon for dioxins and with calcium hydroxide for 
acid pollutants such as hydrochloric acid. The filter plant is 
constantly being improved: Emissions will be further reduced 
next year by waste gas recirculation. The highly contaminated 
filter dusts are incinerated in the sintering plant; 
temperatures around 1,200 degrees Celsius also destroy dioxins. 
  So only approximately 2 nanograms TEQ of dioxins and furanes 
now enter the atmosphere in Bremen instead of 5.7 previously. 
Emissions of polluting dust are also below 10 milligrams per 
cubic meter, far below the limit applicable from 1.3.1994 under 
the Air Pollution Control Regulations (50 milligrams per cubic 
meter); other sintering plants give off between 75 and 200 
milligrams. Kloeckner has contractually promised the city of 
Bremen to reduce emissions to below 1 nanogram TEQ per cubic 
meter by January 1994 and to reach the 0.1 nanogram per cubic 
meter limit for garbage incineration plants by the start of 
1997. If the firm fails to do so, it is threatened with closure. 
  With this contract Kloeckner demonstrates that far lower 
emissions than are now usual are technically possible. In 
December the laender of Bremen and Lower Saxony will therefore 
be tabling a motion in the Upper House of Parliament to have 
corresponding limits prescribed by law for the country as a 
whole.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- A German freight train loaded with 
pesticides, which has been standing at the Albanian border for a 
long time, is giving rise to the danger of an environmental 
disaster. According to experts, the population and nearby Lake 
Shkoder might be in considerable danger as several containers 
have sprung leaks and substances have escaped into the wagons. 
Federal Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer (CDU) intends to 
make 1.4 million marks available immediately for emergency 
safety measures, a spokesman for his ministry said in Bonn on 
Saturday [27 November]. 
  There are 217 tonnes of pesticides in the 17 wagons, which 
was supplied by Germany following an order from Albania. 
Following its political transformation, Albania decided not to 
use these pesticides and asked the Federal Government to take 
them back. The ministry spokesman said this was not an illegal 
export of waste. 
  According to a report in the WESTDEUTSCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG 
(WAZ), a poison cloud could hit the town of Shkoder and affect 
Montenegro or even parts of Italy, depending on the direction of 
the wind. The Environment Ministry spokesman also pointed out 
that 3,600 tonnes of pesticides from the European Union [EU] and 
World Bank stocks were still being kept in several stores in 
Albania. The EU plans to take immediate steps to dispose of the 
pesticides. However, details had not yet been worked out.

<F P=106> [Article by Christina Barofke: ``The New German Laender Test </F>
Market: Successful Technology often Comes from the East''] 
  [Text] The new German laender have become the test market 
for environment technology. Two developments have emerged: 
firstly, more and more eastern companies are settling the fight 
for survival by clever marketing, suitable partners for 
production sharing, and innovative environmental know-how. The 
result: Production sites in the new laender have the latest 
environment technology which is also talked about in the west. 
Secondly, more and more companies from the old German laender 
are making use of the advantages the East has to offer. 
<H5>  Modern Paint Shops </H5>
  When, for example, the paint shop of the new Opel Works in 
Eisenach was brought into operation in July 1992, a new age 
began for automobile finishing. For the first time, water-borne 
paints are being used in all the paint sectors in an automobile 
works. The paint shop of the Thuringian works is considered to 
be the most modern of its kind in the world. 
  Another example is the 700 million German mark [DM] paper 
mill belonging to the Haindl group in Schwedt an der Oder. The 
company, whose registered office is in Augsburg, is staking the 
success of its fourth production site wholly on recycled paper. 
Situated right on the Polish border, it is the first paper mill 
in Germany in which newsprint is produced primarily from waste 
paper. Not only the annual capacity of 250,000 tonnes but also 
the environment technology are impressive. The plant uses 
virtually closed water circuits in production, a 
chemical-mechanical and a two-stage biological clarification 
stage, and a modern combined heating and power station for 
recycling residual materials. The amount of residual effluent 
is about ten liters per kilogram of paper produced; Haindl 
claims the energy saving is about 80 percent compared to primary 
fiber production. An annual figure of 300,000 tonnes of waste 
paper from Berlin, Brandenburg, and the other eastern German 
laender are to be treated; even the parent company in Augsburg 
intends to use the process. 
  Foron Household Appliances GmbH in Niederschmiedsberg near 
Chemnitz has also given the competition something to fear in 
terms of environment technology (see commentary). With its 
first CFC- and FC-free refrigerator in the world, it has filled 
a gap in the environment technology market. After the new 
generation of appliances was presented in April, 80,000 
appliances were sold even before production began; the figure 
will be 150,000 by the end of the year. 
  Obviously, it is not only the pioneering spirit that is 
driving the companies in the East towards innovation and 
commitment. Nowhere else are the investment conditions as good 
as they are in the new German laender. The industrial 
investment subsidies from the government, laender, and local 
authorities, and also the financial participation of the 
privatization agency in the start-up losses incurred by company 
purchases and the necessary remedial measures are creating a 
``entrepreneurial'' climate. Rapid approval planning, which 
those in western Germany can only dream about, underscore these 
advantages. 
  The individual regional governments are also endeavoring to 
support environment technologies. The need for in situ remedial 
measures and the future requirements in environment technology 
make this expenditure seem appropriate. The Brandenburg 
Ministry for Economic Affairs under Minister Hirche, for 
example, has so far supported the 150 projects in the 
``Brandenburg Technology Initiative'' with funds totalling more 
than DM35 million. 
<H5>  First Prize for Innovation </H5>
  Saxony's Environment Minister Vaatz has awarded an 
``Innovation prize for exceptional achievement in waste 
avoidance and recycling'' for the first time in 1993. In the 
category of industrial and commercial enterprises, 
Eilenburg-based Electrolysis and Environment Technology GmbH 
received first prize for a process for recycling electronic 
waste. In the future, the peroxodisulphate process will 
guarantee that circuit boards are processed in an economic and 
environmentally acceptable way. For the first time, it is 
possible to collect, sort and subsequently separate out, stage 
by stage, the metals contained in shredded printed circuit board 
material. Closed material circuits mean there are virtually no 
residues to dispose of; in the ideal case, ultra-pure metals 
such as copper, platinum, solder metal, and even gold are 
obtained. The patent for the copper recycling process has 
already been granted. 
  The east Berlin-based company Wemex has developed a complete 
treatment plant for electronic waste. The pilot plant with an 
hourly throughput of 980 kg, which was presented to the public 
in June, is a world first in its complexity. Ninety-eight 
percent of the materials contained in the old electric and 
electronic appliances will be recovered. The use of 
dry-mechanical processes prevents harmful waste gases, vapours 
or slurries. High-performance air filters ensure minimal dust 
emissions. Interested parties from Germany and Europe have 
already been knocking at the company's door. There is also a 
production sharing agreement with a Japanese firm. 
<H5>  Good Prospects of Success </H5>
  A process for cleaning building facades developed by 
Geo-Proft GmbH, Leipzig, is regarded as particularly worth 
promoting. The company has developed a mobile system for 
removing even severe grime, whereby no waste water enters the 
sewer system. The polluted water is collected and recycled. 
According to the company, 3,000 liters of water can clean up to 
5,000 sq.m. of facade, for which about 40,000 liters are 
required with conventional processes. The company sees good 
prospects of success, particularly in view of the immense demand 
for remedial work in the new German laender. 
  Moba Dresden GmbH in Freital offers high-tech for the solid 
waste industry. The company, which stemmed from a research 
department of the state-owned agricultural machinery firm 
Progress, has developed a computer-integrated waste disposal 
system (CAS). ``Mawis'' (Moba Automatic Waste Identification 
System) is an identification and clearing system for waste 
containers. Large-scale use of the system is planned not only 
in several rural districts in Saxony, but also in the Lower 
Saxony rural districts of Wesermarsch and Osterholz- Scharmbeck. 
  HGN, Hydrogeology GmbH in Nordhausen has an important 
contribution to make to special projects concerning the clean-up 
of toxic waste. The newly-developed purification reactor of the 
Thuringia-based engineering company can be used in situ or as a 
mobile unit and is suitable for the biological decontamination 
of small quantities of soil polluted with hydrocarbons. It is 
economically viable even for small soil loads of around 500 
tonnes. 
  Environment technology of a completely different kind is 
offered by IAC, Engineering Association for Applied Computer 
Technology mbH, Leipzig. In October, the software producer 
intends to bring a highly developed geoinformation system onto 
the market which will be used for the identification, processing 
and evaluation of maps, plans of a geographical nature, and 
infrastructure networks. In view of its new technology, the PC 
program Polygis/W will also help specialist authorities, 
planning offices and universities to reduce the costs of 
cartographic work. Looking at the competition from the old 
German laender, IAC manager Tischer mentions other advantages: 
``The program can also be used by a computer novice after a 
short introduction period, and the users do not need to learn a 
special programming language.'' 
  Lausitz-based Brown Coal GmbH regards itself as being in the 
vanguard of plastics recycling. With its help, Dual System 
Germany GmbH, whose credibility has been badly shaken, intends 
to keep at least some of its promises. The gas works of the 
Black Pump energy works in Spremberg in Brandenburg are 
currently being retrofitted by the brown coal and energy company 
and will then be one of the largest waste recycling plants in 
Germany. Synthesis gas will be obtained from plastics, waste 
oil, rubber, and sewage sludge; this gas can in turn be used 
for the chemical industry. 
<H5>  Largest Sorting Plant </H5>
  The East has another highlight to offer: something that 
ought 
long to have been standard from an environmental standpoint is 
at last becoming a reality. Since the summer of this year, the 
site of Eko Steel AG in Eisenhuettenstadt has not only been the 
site of the largest German plastics sorting plant operated by 
Berlin-based Alba GmbH &amp; Co KG. Before long, this site will 
also be producing, for the first time, garbage bins made of 
recycled plastics with the cooperation of the garbage container 
producer Fritz Schaefer GmbH, Neunkirchen. There is no doubt 
that this will be the starting gun for the spread of ``the most 
typical'' of all recycled products throughout Germany. 40,000 
containers have already been ordered for the ``green spot'' in 
Berlin. 
  [Box, p 29] Convincing Proof 
  The fact that ecology and economics can enter into a close 
association for the benefit of a market-conscious company has 
long been proven. Nevertheless, the example of the Saxony-based 
company Foron GmbH, which came away with the German Environment 
Association's coveted Environment prize for 1993 for the first 
completely CFC- and FC-free and hence particularly 
environmentally acceptable refrigerator, deserves special 
attention. 
  It shows that clever management and an industrious 
workforce, 
even in a medium-sized enterprise in eastern Germany, can 
exploit a profitable gap in the market for ecologically 
acceptable consumer goods. It is merely a matter of identifying 
these gaps. The sensational success of the ``Clean Cooler'' by 
no means fell into Foron's lap. Even in the painfully 
privatized company that succeeded the combine dkk [as published] 
Scharfenstein, the new beginning was hard work. However, the 
ambitious ore mountain dwellers did not resort to moaning about 
the lead other companies had over them; they wanted to be in the 
lead themselves. And they come up with a highly successful 
worldwide first. Obviously, not everyone has the luck of the 
hard worker to have two such powerful midwives as the 
environmental protection organization Greenpeace and one of the 
largest German mail order companies to smooth the path to the 
market. But there is more to it than that. Much more important 
is the proof provided by Foron that there are definitely 
opportunities for a medium-sized eastern German company to do 
business in the field of ecotechnology. Though admittedly, 
creativity and know-how need to be accompanied by a little 
optimism.

  [Text] The BMFT [Federal Ministry of Research and 
Technology] has approved three pioneering pilot projects to 
develop and test new technologies for cleansing heavily 
contaminated soils for which no reclamation process exists to 
date. The funding budget for these polluted site reclamation 
projects in the new federal laender amounts to more than 25 
million German marks [DM]. The following cases of pollution are 
to be treated: 
  -- mercury pollution at BUNA AG; 
  -- dioxin and heavy-metal contamination at the Ilsenburg 
Copper Mill in the Wernigerode district, Saxony-Anhalt, and 
  -- the Zichov ``Great Hell'' industrial dump used by the 
Schwedt petrochemical combine near Angermuende in Brandenburg. 
  With a DM19-million grant, the BUNA project is by far the 
largest of these pilot reclamation projects. From 1938 to 1990, 
BUNA AG used calcium carbide, plus the carbide, acetylene, and 
chlorine that it produced itself, primarily to produce PVC 
[polyvinyl chloride], solvents, and organic intermediate and 
special products. Over the many years that it operated, 
chlor-alkali-electrolysis and ethanal production by the mercury 
process built up a high level of mercury contamination in the 
buildings, production plant, and the site in general. 
Inadequate plant maintenance and a complete lack of environment 
protection systems are two of the causes, but war damage also 
contributed to the high level of contamination. Several 
thousand tonnes of mercury cannot be accounted for; they were 
presumably discharged into the surrounding area via exhaust 
fumes and effluent or penetrated the soil and the buildings and 
plant directly. 
  In addition to developing and testing advanced analysis and 
inspection methods for locating and assessing hazards, the 
project sets out to devise safe, environment-compatible, 
cost-effective methods for demolishing the buildings and plant 
using physical and thermal processes. On-site safety and health 
safeguards for the workers involved are major aspects. The 
pilot project is scheduled to conclude with a full-scale trial 
involving the demolition of a hangar bay and the electrolysis 
plant and the cleansing of a representative quantity of 
contaminated material and soil. 
  There are no technically proven and economically viable 
processes to date for eliminating mercury contamination. A 
success scored in the BUNA project would therefore pave the way 
for dealing with other polluted sites as well. Mercury 
contamination is also present in Bitterfeld, Ammendorf, and 
Osternienburg, where mercury was used in electrolysis plants. 
In the original federal laender, the former Marktredwitz and 
Eilwenn-Frankenbach sites and numerous former potassium cyanide 
treatment works suffer from mercury pollution. 
  The site of the former Ilsenburg Copper Mill and the area 
surrounding it have a high level of dioxin, furan, and other 
heavy metal pollution after decades of copper extraction from 
secondary sources such as PVC-covered copper cables or computer 
scrap without any environment protection measures whatsoever. 
Extreme concentrations of heavy metals are recorded in the 
sewers running into the Ilse drainage canal. The site is to be 
used in the future to extend the nearby Ilsenburg Rolling Mill, 
the major local employer. Dust containing dioxin blows over the 
urban area and the already polluted arable and pastureland, 
representing a high hazard potential. The drainage canal is at 
extreme risk, and the neighboring rolling mill, which is still 
operating, is under threat. 
  The project that has now been approved will develop reliable 
processes for decontaminating industrial buildings that cannot 
be demolished in the normal way. Existing processes will also 
be adapted for scrap, stockpile, and industrial site 
decontamination and dioxin- and heavy metal-polluted residue 
treatment. The results of the project will be used in the 
reclamation of numerous other secondary raw material recovery 
mill sites in the new federal laender. A grant of DM4.2 m 
illion has been awarded for the first stage of the project. 
  The Zichow ``Great Hell'' is a large geologically formed 
hollow measuring about 12,000 sq.m, which has been used since 
1964 as a dump for the former Schwedt/Oder petrochemical 
combine. By 1989, 100,000 cu.m of production residue and 
hazardous waste in solid, paste, and liquid form had been dumped 
there without any environmental precautions being taken. The 
practice of burning chlorous fluids off on the surface of the 
lake thus created polluted the surrounding area with dioxins. 
The lack of a sealed foundation means that the dump drains 
directly into the groundwater and the drinking water 
conservation area. 
  The initial phase will comprise the development of a 
practicable reclamation strategy for decontaminating liquid and 
solid deposits in the light of a hazard potential assessment, 
and the immediate implementation of protective measures for 
averting the danger. The second phase envisages a pilot 
reclamation of part of the toxic dump using a combination of 
various reclamation methods. The subsidy for the first phase 
amounts to DM2.2 million. Here again, the existence of numerous 
tar lakes makes for a high degree of transferrability. 
  These three major reclamation projects complement the 
funding 
program that has been under way in the original federal laender 
since 1989 under the heading, ``Pilot Reclamation of Polluted 
Sites,'' which sets out to demonstrate the efficacy of 
reclamation processes in the face of a number of different, 
though representative, problem cases in large-scale trials and 
to develop new processes. Since its launch, the BMFT has spent 
more than DM100 million on this program. The results will be 
used to devise a comprehensive guide to help reclamation teams 
work out strategies and select the right processes.

  [Text] The Federal Environment Ministry considers rumors of 
toxic matter from Seveso having been deposited on the Schoenberg 
dump in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania as ``unrealistic.'' At 
the last meeting of the Environment, Nature Conservation, and 
Reactor Safety Committee, held on 20 October, the ministry 
denied media reports that dummies had been incinerated in Basel 
in 1986 instead of the 41 drums containing highly toxic dioxin 
from Italy: The documentation supplied by the Hoffmann-La Roche 
chemicals group stated that the incineration process had been 
monitored by the Swiss authorities, and this appeared plausible, 
said the ministry. An investigation program had nevertheless 
been initiated, in the course of which the area under and around 
the Schoenberg dump would be inspected and the dump's archives 
would be laid open. In the meantime, a computer model of the 
site was being drawn up to give an idea as to which type of 
waste was where, and as to the areas for which there was no 
information, the Federal Government stated. 
  Representatives of the Alliance 90/Greens parliamentary 
party 
pointed out that the dump's bookkeeping had been doctored and 
that there was insufficient data to trace any old toxic drums. 
Not for nothing had the Schoenberg area enjoyed ``top secret 
site'' status in the days of the GDR. The group also voiced the 
criticism that the inspection had been set in motion only after 
a ``considerable delay,'' in spite of the long-standing 
suspicion that toxic matter from Seveso had found its way to 
Schoenberg. The CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian 
Social Union] parliamentary party was of the opinion that, by 
GDR standards, Schoenberg was one of the safest dumps. The FDP 
[Free Democratic Party] parliamentary party also shared the view 
that ``agitation'' seemed out of place. SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] deputies called on the Federal Government not 
to leave the entire responsibility for such matters with the 
laender should evidence of deposits of dioxin from Seveso come 
to light. For its part, the government gave assurances that it 
would investigate all suspicious circumstances. In the event of 
the offending drums emerging, they would be returned ``promptly 
and without red tape'' to sender.

  [Text] The first-ever pocket devices for measuring the 
concentration of glucose (blood sugar) and lactate (lactic acid) 
were developed in Germany and came onto the market at the 
beginning of the year, and now the breakthrough for 
user-freindly miniaturized biosensor devices has been made in 
environment monitoring too, with the formaldehyde detector 
developed by Draegerwerk AG. An air pollutant detector will 
come onto the market before the end of the current year in the 
shape of the highly sensitive ``Bio-Check F'' pocket meter, 
which is based on biomolecular detection principles. Unlike 
conventional metering methods, which are so complicated that 
they can only be applied by specialists and are 
laboratory-dependent, this device can be used easily, rapidly, 
and anywhere by anyone, and is also reasonably priced. This 
will encourage widespread use in the interests of improving 
health and environmental protection. 
  The main factors that had to be guaranteed in developing a 
reliable system that private individuals could use to measure 
the formaldehyde concentration in the air indoors were high 
sensitivity, easy use, and low production costs. An indicator 
surface on the ``Bio-Check F'' changes color from white through 
pink to red, and comparison with a color-code strip shows 
whether the formaldehyde concentration in the air is below the 
maximum recommended indoor level, is equal to it, or exceeds it. 
It is thus just as easy to use as, for example, an alcohol 
level test for drivers. The new detector also brings the cost 
of formaldehyde measurement way below (to less than a third of) 
that of the laboratory process needed to date. 
  Formaldehyde is widely used as a basic ingredient for 
synthetic resins. The gas, which in its pure form is colorless 
and gives off a pungent smell, is used in the production of 
amino plastics and phenolic plastics, which in turn are 
ingredients of products such as adhesives, synthetic foams, 
insulating materials, floor coverings, and textiles (which it 
renders crease-resistant). If formaldehyde is released by the 
glues used in furniture, wall coverings, and chipboard, or by 
furnishing fabrics, it can cause discomfort or even, in higher 
concentrations, constitute a health hazard. The Federal Health 
Authority therefore recommends 0.1 ppm (parts per million) as 
the threshold value for air quality assessment purposes in the 
home, in schools, and in other indoor environments. In other 
words, the formaldehyde concetration ought not to exceed one 
10-millionth by volume, for example 0.1 milliliter per cubic 
meter. 
  The new measuring system is enzyme-based. These biological 
catalysts make it possible to single out and register only the 
substance to be measured. To perform the measurement, the 
system is activated by pressing the base of a phial in the 
measuring device with the thumb, thus breaking it. The liquid 
thus released flows into a small, permeable, sintered glass rod, 
where it activates the freeze-dried enzymes and the reagents. 
Of the molecules that diffuse over the surface of the glass 
rod, the only ones converted are those ``recognized'' by the 
enzyme contained there (formaldehyde dehydrogenase). As a 
result, pigment molecules form on the surface of the rod. The 
color change that takes place after two hours can be evaluated 
using a color comparison strip.

and Ecology] Project Manager, Berlin Regional Office, Federal 
Ministry of Research and Technology, Hannoversche Str. 30,

<F P=106> [Article by Thomas Buehrke: ``Aircraft Engines on the Test </F>
Bench -- New Ideas for Reducing Polluting Nitrogen Oxide 
Emissions From Aircraft''] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In the light of satellite 
surveys, experts from the German Aerospace Research Institute 
(DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, near Munich, believe that passenger 
aircraft have given rise to a half-percent extension in 
cloudage. However, the effect that this has on temperature is 
not known. Thin ice clouds bring about warming, whereas thick 
clouds cause cooling; which effect predominates is not known. 
<H5>  Raising Profits by Using Less Fuel </H5>
  Meanwhile, engineers are seeking ``new aircraft engine 
designs that will consume 10 to 20 percent less kerosine and 
discharge up to 80 percent less nitrogen oxide,'' says Jost 
Schmidt, head of Munich- based MTU's development division. Fuel 
still accounts for about a third of an aircarft's overall 
running costs, and a 2-percent cut in running costs would double 
an airline's annual profits. Moreover, there are countries that 
levy an environment duty: For instance, the Swedish government 
has for four years been levying an emission- dependent tax on 
civil aircraft landing at Swedish airports. 
  There is a large market waiting for the engine builders: 
Experts put sales over the next 10 years at $120 billion in the 
civil sector alone. However, the cost of a research program to 
develop a new type of engine is put at $1-2 billion, an 
investment that the experts say would take about 15 years to 
amortize. 
  Four years ago, Pratt &amp; Whitney, FiatAvio, and MTU 
formed a 
joint venture to build the advanced ducted propulsion (ADP) 
proposed by Pratt &amp; Whitney engineers and prepare it for 
testing. The project is linked to an experimental and 
engineering program for future propulsion systems subsidized by 
the Research Ministry in Bonn, which has already poured a total 
of 100 million German marks into the project. 
  A test proptype of this new engine successfully underwent 
initial trials on a test bench in Florida just under a year ago, 
and special functions, such as the reverse thrust, have just 
been tested in a NASA wind tunnel in California. 
  ADP is based partially on conventional principles but 
operates with greater efficiency than current engines. The 
engineers have achieved this result by substantially raising 
what is known as the by-pass ratio. Part of the air normally 
flows through the inner core area, while the rest flows past it 
on the outside, providing the desired propulsion. The drawback 
inherent in raising this by- pass ratio is that it increases 
engine diameter by about 50 percent. If the advantage of lower 
fuel consumption is not to be canceled out by the weight gain, 
new materials must be developed that will be as light as 
possible while withstanding extreme loads. MTU is therefore 
undertaking research into fiber-reinforced composites about 
three times as light as titanium. The engineers are confident 
that ADP will be in use by the turn of the century. 
  An MTU idea known as CRISP (counter-rotating integrated 
shrouded propfan) goes a step further, having not the usual 
single rotor at the engine intake, but two rotating in opposite 
directions, thus increasing the air throughput. However, CRISP 
research is currently on the ``back burner'' for financial 
reasons. 
<H5>  Hydrogen Brings Problems </H5>
  Last but not least, ``alternative'' fuels are still being 
fielded as a means of reducing exhaust emissions. Veritable 
miracles are being attributed to hydrogen in particular, 
although engines running on hydrogen discharge double the amount 
of water vapor emitted by a conventional engine and would thus 
increase cloud formation. Moreover, the assumption that an 
aircraft running on hydrogen would discharge nothing but water 
vapor is false. 
  NASA research showed 20 years ago that at high combustion 
temperatures nitrogen oxidizes out of air to form nitrogen 
oxides. Discharges of these gases cannot actually be reduced by 
introducing alternative fuels: New, more efficient combustion 
chambers would be required even in this case. Creating them 
would entail exploring virgin territory in engineering, because 
the hydrogen has to be cooled to below minus 252 degrees Celsius 
in the tanks, with the risk that components might ice up or 
become brittle. Moreover, energy content for energy content, 
hydrogen is four times more voluminous than kerosine, so 
additional tanks would inevitably have to be incorporated.

  [Editorial Report] Hamburg ARD Television Network in 
German at 1915 GMT on 18 November in its ``Monitor'' program 
carries a 14-minute report by West German Radio and Television 
(WDR) journalists Herbert Blondiau and Ekkehard Sieker claiming 
that the 41 barrels containing poisonous Dioxin from the 
disaster in the Italian city of Seveso in 1976 were buried in a 
waste dump in the Mecklenburg Western Pomeranian city of 
Schoenberg, in the former GDR, and, subsequently, a five-minute 
live interview with the environment minister of Mecklenburg 
Western Pomerania, Frieder Jelen. 
  The two journalists claim that, on the basis of documents, 
``we know today that dioxin was actually produced in Seveso'' 
and that it was not the result of an accident there, as claimed 
by the responsible Swiss company, Hoffmann-La Roche. The 41 
highly poisonous barrels were ``secretly'' shipped to France for 
provisional storage after the accident, from where they later 
disappeared. Several months after that, barrels were found in 
northern France and publicly incinerated in Basel, Switzerland. 
  Sergio Angeletti, an official from Milan who was responsible 
for monitoring the removal of the barrels from Seveso at the 
time, has now ``broken his silence'' and said that the barrels 
that were incinerated in Basel were not those that contained the 
hazardous dioxin. Angeletti states that he and the ``special 
authorities'' knew even at the time that the barrels were to be 
shipped to ``a communist country in Eastern Europe,'' the GDR. 
  The journalists state that documents that were made 
available 
to them prove that the dioxin-containing barrels were sent to 
the waste dump at Schoenberg, between Luebeck and Schwerin, in 
the GDR. Sieker and Blondiau note that a ``government commission 
in Milan is currently reexamining the inconsistencies of 
Seveso.'' 
  A Schoenberg butcher, identified as Mr. Zander, tells the 
journalists that an ``absolutely trustworthy'' informer, who 
witnessed the arrival of the barrels at the Schoenberg dump, 
told him details of the burying of the barrels. Names of 
``high-ranking'' officials of the Schoenberg dump are also 
mentioned. Another witness states that he knows the exact spot 
where the 41 barrels were buried at the Schoenberg dump. 
Responsible officials of the administration of the Schoenberg 
dump refused to comment on these charges and only produced 
documents that show that a request for dumping the Seveso 
barrels there was rejected. 
  The journalists claim that all the documents passed on to 
Mecklenburg Western Pomeranian Environment Minister Frieder 
Jelen have been ``manipulated.'' 
  Sieker and Blondiau conclude their report by stating that 
their investigations prove ``that what was incinerated in Basel 
in 1983 was not the ominous 41 barrels from Seveso but 
duplicates. The original barrels were taken to the refuse dump 
at Schoenberg, where they have probably remained to this today. 
Seveso is not over yet.'' 
  In the ensuing live interview with the environment minister 
of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, Frieder Jelen, by Klaus 
Bednarz, the minister says that he will try to ``get in touch 
with the committee investigating the case in Lombardy.'' He 
adds that it will also be necessary to ``get access'' to all the 
documents that were made available to journalists Sieker and 
Blondiau. Scientists will have to examine whether one can dig 
out the barrels at Schoenberg. Jelen notes that it will ``not 
be possible'' to remove the barrels secretly from the dump now, 
because the case has been handed over to the state prosecutor 
and the Schwerin police authorities.

<F P=106> [Interview with Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer by Ulrich </F>
Deupmann and Giovanni di Lorenzo; place and date not given: 
``CDU (Christian Democratic Union) Should Also Examine 
Possibilities for Cooperation With the Greens''] 
  [Excerpt] 
  SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: You are not known as an 
enemy of Greenpeace -- do you understand the occupation of the 
nuclear waste storage site in Morsleben? 
  Toepfer: First of all: Despite all understanding 
for personal involvement, it is impossible that someone protests 
without any consideration for law and order and then gets an 
appointment with the minister. Therefore, I would like to make 
one thing clear: My condition was an end to the occupation -- 
then the talk. I offered this talk so that I could make it 
clear that there is nothing like a ``sacrificial area'' in the 
new laender -- following the slogan: The storage site from the 
old GDR [German Democratic Republic] times is used without any 
checks so that it can take in the radioactive waste from all 
over Germany as quickly as possible. This impression is wrong. 
In the case of Morsleben, we have ordered independent, 
comprehensive examinations, we have tightened the safety 
measures, and have reduced the active potential of the waste. 
There is no safety discount. In order to make this clear we 
discussed the matter with Greenpeace, but hardly ever have I had 
such an awkward feeling as during these talks. 
  SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: You stick to Morsleben. 
What is the conclusion derived from that for the Federal 
Government's energy policy? 
  Toepfer: Morsleben does not mean that the 
licensing procedure for the Konrad final storage site is no 
longer possible. Whoever believed that this has been settled by 
putting low-radioactive waste in final storage in Morsleben, is 
very wrong. Of course, the corresponding steps for getting a 
permit for the Konrad mine continue. By closing down Greifswald 
and Rheinsberg, and because of an extremely high amount of other 
sources of radiation and radioactive waste, we have a 
considerable amount of waste in the new laender. We must 
integrate Morsleben quite normally into Germany's waste disposal 
infrastructure -- just as the facilities in the western laender 
are available for waste from all over Germany, too. 
  SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: This also means that the 
Federal Government and its environment minister stick to nuclear 
energy -- and, as a result, accept all ensuing waste disposal 
problems. 
  Toepfer: I really think that it is a very 
superficial morality not to use a technology in our country, 
which has been recognized as being difficult, while knowing 
that, in other countries, it will be used even more intensively. 
The safety standards -- or better, the safety culture, which is 
more than just safety technology -- which have been developed in 
our country also mean that it is better for us to accept 
responsibility for this technology in our country than to fob it 
off on those places where it is used with rather less safety, 
such as in Central and Eastern Europe, for instance. However, 
we must be aware of the fact that we are not dealing with an 
absolutely risk-free technology, so that constant safety checks 
are indispensable. In order to justify nuclear energy, I have 
never made relative environmental comparisons between the 
various energy sources. Any energy must prove to be justifiable 
with its remaining risk. We also cannot -- as we did in the 
past -- ignore our obligation for research, a more intensive use 
of other energy sources, and saving energy by saying that we 
have got nuclear energy and thus something like a 
prrpetual-motion energy policy. I want to make every effort to 
facilitate energy supplies without nuclear energy, but I see the 
necessity to preserve the specific option of nuclear energy at 
the moment and to contribute to decisively expanding the safety 
standards in a new generation of nuclear power plants. 
  SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: In the laender, you are also 
dealing with environmental ministers from a completely different 
camp, for instance with experienced ministers of the Greens. Is 
cooperation with these colleagues now possible, at least on 
certain issues, despite or because of your just-described 
attitude? 
  Toepfer: I can answer this question with yes 
without any reservations. I have already mentioned exceptions, 
such as energy policy. In environmental policy, in particular, 
we must not always stress the party policy differences in our 
answers, but must ask which are the environmentally justifiable 
answers. I really think that this is extremely important, and 
the citizens expect that from us. They do not ask whether a 
good answer was worked out by a green, a black, or a red 
politician. And in some corners, and at some edges, one 
surprisingly finds coinciding views. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Where do used CFC's [chlorofuorocarbons] go? Though 
the process of replacing them with products 
(hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC's) and hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFC's] that cause less damage to the ozone layer is now 
proceeding extremely rapidly, old refrigerators still contain 
the much feared gas. 
  The solution to this problem comes from Bologna and is 
called 
ICF (Refrigerator Components Company) and ENEA [Agency for New 
Technologies, Energy, and the Environment]. The joint effort 
between the Emilia-based company and the research body has led 
to the development of Cleaner 12 and Cleaner 134: semiautomatic 
systems for the recovery and recycling of CFC's that are capable 
of regenerating the R12 and R143a gas. The Cleaner is a filter 
system. The CFC is separated by evaporating the oil from the 
system and is filtered a first time. Two other filtering 
stations are used to neutralize the acidity, absorb humidity, 
and withhold the solid particles. A third filter completes the 
purifying operation and finally the cryogenic gas that is 
regenerated is stored in a dosage container. 
  The Cleaner can also automatically load and unload the 
purified gas directly into the refrigeration system by simply 
using different pressure levels. The ENEA-ICF patent is 
currently the only means of recycling CFC's. Another CFC 
treatment system is thermal destruction. This operation 
requires a great deal of energy and is a highly costly one. The 
technology tested by ICF is suitable not only for the treatment 
of CFC's but also for the HCFC's and HFC's that are currently 
used as CFC substitutes.

  [Text] The second document we present in this series 
concerns a collaboration agreement signed last spring by the 
Ministry of the Environment and the CNR [National Research 
Council]. 
  The agreement, which has a duration of five years, relates 
to 
joint action by the Ministry and the CNR to promote initiatives 
aimed at increasing the awareness and protection of the 
environment. 
  For the achievement of programs of common interest, the 
agreement provides for the constitution of an advisory committee 
whose duties will include, among others, the appropriation of 
the funds necessary to carry out the interventions. 
<H5>  Given That the Ministry </H5>
  In terms of the provisions of Article 1 of Law No. 349 dated 
8 July 1986 establishing that the Ministry of the Environment 
has a duty to: 
  -- Ensure within an organic framework the promotion, the 
conservation, and the recovery of environmental conditions in 
conformity with the fundamental interests of the community, and 
with the quality of life, as well as the conservation and 
improvement of the national natural heritage, and the defense of 
natural resources from pollution; 
  -- Carry out and promote studies, investigations, and 
surveys 
of environmental interest; 
  -- Adopt, using all channels of information, initiatives 
aimed at making the public aware of environmental needs and 
problems; 
  -- Draw up national environmental research programs. 
  To enable it to fulfill these duties, the Ministry may under 
Article 8 (1) avail itself of, among others, specialized public 
bodies operating at national level with which it may enter into 
appropriate agreements. 
<H5>  Given that the CNR </H5>
  In terms of Article 1 of Decree No. 82 dated 1 March 1945, 
it 
is a government body and as such, ``promotes, coordinates, and 
oversees scientific research aimed at scientific and technical 
progress; acts as a consultant in matters concerning the 
country's scientific- technical research activities; provides 
for the compilation of technical regulations of a general 
character, and studies problems of a technical-scientific 
nature.'' 
  -- Plans and develops research programs in relation to 
specific local requirements and to the characteristics of the 
territory and environment, with actions directed toward the 
acquisition of an advanced level of scientific knowledge of an 
interdisciplinary nature; 
  -- Uses its network of research bodies, both institutes and 
centers, in joint projects aimed at improving our knowledge and 
understanding of the environment; 
  -- May avail itself of collaboration with universities and 
with bodies and companies specializing in research, stipulating 
contracts as well as agreements with the government, the 
regions, and local authorities. 
<H5>  It Is Agreed as Follows: </H5>
<H5>  Article 1 </H5>
  The Ministry of the Environment and the CNR, within the 
framework of their respective areas of competence, agree to work 
toward the initiation of joint programs and initiatives aimed at 
an increased knowledge of, and protection of the environment, in 
the following manner: 
  1) At the express request of the minister, work groups may 
be 
constituted, open also to university research bodies; 
  2) The CNR puts at the Ministry's disposal, the results of 
its defined projects and of its strategic projects already 
carried to term; 
  3) As far as future defined projects and strategic projects 
and those currently being carried out are concerned, the CNR 
agrees to the highest degree of participation by the Ministry, 
in as many ways as possible; 
  4) The CNR, with its technical-scientific structures, will 
contribute toward the realization of the three-year plan for the 
protection of the environment, as provided for in Law 305/88, by 
providing the Ministry with scientific consultancy, research and 
documentary support, and the performance of work of a scientific 
nature. 
<H5>  Article 2 </H5>
  The Ministry, independently of the provisions of the 
preceding Article 1, and on the basis of its own annual reports 
and consequent programs, may instruct the CNR to carry out 
specific research and study activities. 
<H5>  Article 3 </H5>
  The financial onus for the fulfillment of the activities 
provided for in this collaboration agreement will be determined 
by the respective bodies involved, taking into account the 
programs agreed upon and the level of involvement of the 
research bodies. 
<H5>  Article 4 </H5>
  In order to promote the realization of programs of common

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Structural Policy: Cohesion Fund </F>
Projects Approved for Portugal''; as released by Brussels 
Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] Portuguese water treatment and road building 
projects worth 79.6 million Ecus were approved by the EC Budget 
Commissioner, Peter Schmidhuber, on October 21. The money falls 
under the Community's Cohesion Financial Instrument, an interim 
measure in place until the beginning of November, when the 
Maastricht Treaty and its Cohesion Fund legislation are due to 
come into force. Of the six projects approved, four are to treat 
or supply water while the others are road projects linked to 
plans for the Trans European Networks. 
  The latest Cohesion Fund projects for Portugal, all of which 
will receive 85% EC funding of their total costs, come after the 
European Commission approved a first batch on July 29. The 
largest of the environmental projects, due to attract 21.6 mEcus 
[million ECU] from the Community, involves the building of three 
plants, at Gondar, Rabada and Agra, to treat industrial and 
domestic waste water in the Ave river basin. A second, due for 
5.1 mEcus EC aid, is to improve water supplies to most of the 
towns in the Barlavento (Algarve). EC funds of 4.6 mEcus will go 
toward an upgrade of water treatment capacity at the ETA 
Asseiceira while a further 11.4 mEcus will part-fund water 
supply projects to places including Vila Nova da Barquinha and 
ConstEncia. 
  Cohesion Funds are intended to help Greece, Spain, Portugal 
and Ireland, the Community's poorest countries, to improve their 
transport and environmental infrastructure as a means to bring 
their economies closer to the convergence criteria required for 
European Economic and Monetary Union. This year, the first in 
the seven-year programme, available funds total 1.565 billion 
Ecus, of which Portugal is to get a 16-20% share. The aid 
is in 
addition to that granted under the Community's Structural Fund 
programmes.

<F P=106> [Article by Lars Eriksson: ``Radioactive Scrap Reclaimed </F>
With New Swedish Method''--first two paragraphs are NY TEKNIK 
introduction] 
  [Text] In the fall Framatome, the French nuclear technology 
firm, will test a new Swedish method to clean and recycle 
radioactive steam generators from nuclear power plants. 
  The method has already been tested on steam generators from 
the closed nuclear reactor in Agesta outside Stockholm. 
  The method for cleaning and recycling steam generators was 
developed by Sweden's Studsvik RadWaste. The Swedish State Power 
Board, a number of Japanese companies via Mitsubishi, the French 
power company EDF and the French nuclear technology firm 
Framatome have supported the development. 
  Framatome has acquired a license to use the method in the 
French market. The method will now be tested on a replaced steam 
generator from the nuclear power plant in Dampierre. If all goes 
well there are more steam generators to take care of. France has 
the highest concentration of nuclear power in Europe. 
  ``This method has two advantages. For one thing we recover 
valuable metals that can be reused and for another we reduce the 
volume of radioactive waste,'' said Olof Andersson, president of 
Studsvik RadWaste. 
  Steam generators consist of a very extensive pipe system. 
The 
total tube length in an average steam generator is approximately 
nine miles. It is in the tubes that most of the radioactivity is 
located. 
  The tubes are rinsed with a liquid called SODP (Strong Ozone 
Decontamination Process). It consists of ozone dissolved in 
nitric acid with cerium nitrate as a catalyst. With the help of 
the solution about five micrometers of oxide deposit are 
removed. It is there the radioactivity is located. The process 
takes 72 hours. 
  ``This type of liquid is sometimes used for cleaning inside 
reactors. But few people believed in our idea that it could be 
used to reclaim steam generators,'' Andersson said. 
<H5>  Metals Separated </H5>
  After it is cleaned the steam generator is melted down and 
the various metals are separated. 
  The method has been successfully tested on two steam 
generators from the closed nuclear power plant in Agesta. The 
radioactivity in the generators fell from 10,000 bequerels per 
gram to at best 1 bequerel per gram as a result of the process. 
  It is somewhat unclear which maximum value applies for a 
free 
classification of radioactive material. At present it is 1 
bequerel per gram in Sweden, according to the SSI [National 
Institute of Radiation Protection] standard, but international 
discussions are under way on this. 
  The solvent contains most of the radioactivity after 
processing. The volume is reduced by evaporating the solution 
(``boiling it down'') and encasing it in cement. This waste 
residue is then shipped for final storage in the storage 
facility for low- and medium-active waste, SFR in Forsmark. 
<H5>  Much Larger </H5>
  Three steam generators were replaced in reactor 2 at the 
Ringhals plant several years ago. Studsvik RadWaste and the 
Ringhals management are currently discussing whether to use the 
new method on them. 
  The Ringhals steam generators are considerably larger than 
the Agesta generators; 300 tons apiece compared with 25 tons. 
The volume is 17 times greater. 
  The radioactivity is 10 times higher. The reason is that the 
Agesta generators have cooled down for about 20 years. The 
reactor was in operation from 1964 to 1974. 
  After a Ringhals steam generator is processed there will be 
50 tons of nickel and chromium and 200 tons of iron left that 
can be recycled. The iron can be used for manufacturing concrete 
reinforcement rods and radiators, among other things. The nickel 
and chromium that is recovered can be used for manufacturing new 
steam generators. 
  That leaves 22 cubic meters of encased radioactive solution, 
four cubic meters of slag from the smelting process and 15 cubic 
meters of massive steel (a tube plate that is considered hard to 
clean). 
  Melting down radioactive material is nothing new in itself. 
In the last 10 years around 1,300 tons of radioactive steel from 
various reactor components and tools have been melted down at 
Studsvik. Some 200 tons of material has been classified as 
radiation-free. The remaining 1,100 tons are being stored at 
Studsvik for final disposal later. 
<H5>  Around 150 Replacements </H5>
  In the next 10 years around 150 steam generators will need 
to 
be replaced worldwide. So Studsvik RadWaste, which holds the 
world patent, hopes that this method will give them a lot of 
good business in the future.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Photoelectrochemical Solar Cells To Go into Mass Production </H5>
  Progress may have been made in the search for 
environmentally-friendly and cheap solar cells. Michael 
Graetzel of the Physical Chemistry Institute of the Federal 
Technical College in Lausanne has succeeded in developing 
dye-coated titanium dioxide elements which are far simpler to 
make than conventional silicon solar cells. 
  Graetzel told an international convention on solar and 
hydrogen technology in Freising a few weeks ago that the new 
solar cells are already being used in electronic bathroom 
scales. They are also used in solar-powered wrist watches, the 
material replacing the watch-glass. Although the output is only 
a few microwatts, it is quite sufficient for the watch mechanism. 
  The starting point for Graetzel's idea was photosynthesis, 
the photochemical principle used by plants to obtain energy from 
sunlight. Graetzel's ``photoelectrochemical'' cell uses a dye 
to capture light quanta like chlorophyll does in plants. 
Graetzel found titanium dioxide to be a semiconductor material 
which transmits the photon charge as electricity in the form of 
electrons; tests have shown it to be extremely stable. 
  The essential trick is to roughen the titanium dioxide 
coating to increase its surface area and thus the number of 
photons captured. In direct light the new solar cell currently 
achieves a 10 percent voltage efficiency. Graetzel believes the 
efficiency can be doubled in the next few years. By comparison, 
cells made from amorphous silicon, currently the cheapest 
material, reach an energy efficiency of only around 5 percent. 
  In diffuse light, where silicon cells provide hardly any 
power worth mentioning, the efficiency of the titanium dioxide 
element is now already around 18 percent. This is chiefly 
because the titanium dioxide's rough nanocrystalline surface is 
suited to the spectrum of diffuse (longer wavelength) light. 
This makes the new technology of interest for applications in 
our latitudes since the solar cell can provide electricity even 
with a cloudy sky. 
  Graetzel describes manufacture as relatively simple, 
requiring neither high temperatures, vacuum, nor nitrogen 
pressure chambers. Titanium dioxide can be applied to glass by 
screen printing. Titanium is also a common natural element, and 
titanium dioxide is nontoxic, unlike the semiconductors cadmium 
tellurite and copper indium diselenite, which are also used for 
solar cells. 
  Graetzel said that a Gelsenkirchen plate glass firm intends 
to make 100 watt solar modules. A pilot plant for mass 
production will be ready there in three years' time. The 
material is expected to cut the current high costs for solar 
modules to one tenth.

<F P=106> [UK Press Release from the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries </F>
and Food: ``Terrestrial Radioactivity Monitoring Programme 
Report''] 
  [Text] A MAFF [Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food] 
report published today shows that radioactivity in foodstuffs 
remains at levels which pose no risk to consumers. 
  The seventh annual report of the Ministry's Terrestrial 
Radioactivity Monitoring Programme (TRAMP), describes the 
extensive scope of MAFF's monitoring programme and contains 
results from the analyses of over 6000 milk, fruit, vegetable, 
meat and environmental samples. The report shows that exposure 
of consumers to radioactivity via the food chain remains well 
below nationally and internationally recommended limits. 
  Government policy is that authorised discharges from any 
single site should not normally give rise to exposure greater 
than 50 percent of the internationally recommended annual dose 
limit for members of the public. The maximum potential exposure 
of consumers via the food chain is around five percent of the 
annual limit. These results are similar to those reported for 
1991 and demonstrate that radioactive waste discharged to the 
atmosphere from major nuclear installations in England and Wales 
has no harmful effect on consumers of locally grown produce.

  [Text] The fifth meeting of the parties to the Montreal 
Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, held in 
Bangkok, adopted its final report yesterday. The report 
contains further recommendations for the protection of the ozone 
layer. To make the measures effective, the multilateral fund 
providing assistance to developing countries to phase out 
ozone-depleting substances was replenished at a level of 510 
million U.S. dollars for the next three years, given unexpended 
funds of 450 million U.S. dollars was required from developed 
countries. [sentence as heard] 
  The composition of the executive committee of the 
multilateral fund was agreed to be Australia, Denmark, France, 
Japan, Norway, Poland, and the United States of America, 
representing developed countries; and Algeria, Argentina, 
Brazil, Cameroon, India, Malaysia, and Venezuela, representing 
developing countries. Malaysia was selected to chair the 
committee and Australia to act as vice chairperson. The meeting 
agreed to add to the list of approved destruction technologies 
municipal solid waste incinerators for foams containing 
ozone-depleting substances. Several representatives endorsed 
the proposal to finance a limited number of methyl bromide 
alternative demonstration projects from the multilateral fund. 
  The Montreal Protocol meeting will be followed next week by 
the third meeting of the conference of the parties of the Vienna 
Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer on 23 and 24 
November. The Montreal Protocol and the Vienna Convention are 
the first global agreements to protect the atmosphere. The 
sixth meeting of parties to the Montreal Protocol will be held 
in Nairobi next year, and the seventh meeting in Vienna in 1995.

  [Text] 
<H5>  Foreword </H5>
  The state of the environment in the Russian Federation in 
1992 remained unsatisfactory in general. The intense pollution 
of the environment by the gaseous, liquid, and solid waste of 
production and consumption continued. The slump in production 
did not bring about a comparable reduction in pollution, because 
enterprises began economizing on environmental protection 
expenditures under these critical conditions. The state of our 
economy is still having an adverse effect on the state of our 
environment. 
  The ecological catastrophe is not a threat to our country 
alone, however. The economic activities of human beings and 
their effects on nature have increased to such proportions that 
they have turned the problem of protecting the biosphere into a 
planetary or global concern. Without any fear of exaggeration, 
we can say that the survival of the human race will depend on 
its ability to solve this problem. 
  Only a comprehensive approach to environmental problems can 
promote the more effective protection and intelligent use of 
ecosystems, the guarantee of a safe future, and the 
harmonization of man's relationship with nature. No country is 
capable of doing this alone. This can only be done through 
concerted effort--on the basis of a global partnership for the 
sake of sustainable development. Development is sustainable if 
it does not disrupt the necessary conditions--social, economic, 
and ecological--for its continuation, reproducing without 
depleting its own basis. 
  These issues were discussed at the UN Conference on 
Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) from 3 to 
14 June 1992. Several documents were approved at the conference, 
including the Declaration on Environment and Development, which 
announced the fundamental principles of sustainable development. 
  These principles lie at the basis of the new Russian state 
ecological policy. 
  The principal objective of state ecological policy is the 
development of a new legal and economic mechanism to regulate 
the environmental effects of economic activity. This mechanism 
would secure the inclusion of environmental requirements as 
essential elements of the procedure for assessing economic 
decisions, comprehensive and sectorial (in terms of different 
types of resources) licenses for resource use, the 
implementation of the principle ``Let the polluter pay,'' 
penalties, and the use of natural resources and ecosystems 
without depleting them. 
  Reforms resulting from the pursuit of state ecological 
policy 
will consist in the following: 
  -- the improvement of environmental protection laws and the 
group of environmental restrictions and regulations governing 
the use of resources for their adaptation to the conditions of 
the more liberal economy and denationalized property; 
  -- a gradual move toward international standards in 
technological processes and products, creating the necessary 
conditions for Russia's inclusion in the world economy and the 
international system of environmental security; 
  -- the unification of existing territorial departmental 
systems for the observation and monitoring of natural resources 
and elements of the environment under a common set of procedural 
and organizational guidelines; 
  -- economic incentives in state tax, credit, and pricing 
policy for the conservation of resources and energy and the 
incorporation of equipment and technology meeting ecological 
requirements; 
  -- ecological appraisals and environmental impact studies of 
the results of all programs and projects related to economic and 
other activity and rigorous oversight of compliance with the 
requirements of environmental impact reports; 
  -- the creation of a market for environmental projects and 
the development of entrepreneurship in this field. 
  All of this is indisputably necessary, but it is not enough 
to prevent environmental catastrophe. New scientific research 
will be needed for a more constructive analysis of the nature 
and implications of potential adverse ecological consequences of 
economic activity and for the guarantee of ecological security. 
In addition, there is no question that the ecological situation 
can only be stabilized and improved by means of changes in the 
focus of the Russian Federation's socioeconomic development, the 
establishment of new values and moral principles, and the 
reconsideration of consumption patterns and the goals, 
priorities, and methods of human activity.

  The state of the environment in the Russian Federation in 
1992 was influenced considerably by general economic processes 
in the country. 
  These processes displayed extremely contradictory 
development 
and were influenced by the following factors: the collapse of 
the political and economic-administrative structures of the 
former USSR; the existence of long-term negative trends dating 
back to the time when the Russian economy was still part of the 
Union; the effects of new economic processes engendered by 
radical economic reform. 
  The collapse of the USSR diminished the actual chances of 
solving ecological problems on the interstate level and in 
Russia itself. The disruption of ties between republics had an 
adverse effect on the production of resource-conserving 
equipment, reagents for the treatment of waste liquids and 
gases, and other products needed for environmental protection. 
Difficulties arose in solving inter-republic ecological problems 
caused by the rising level of the Caspian Sea, the need to 
protect and reproduce the supply of water in coastal and 
trans-border aquifers, the transfer of pollutants through the 
atmosphere, and others. 
  The long-term negative tendencies with the most adverse 
effects on the state of the environment are the structural 
irregularities in the Russian economy, reflected in the 
excessive development of resource-intensive, frequently 
``dirty'' fields of production, the general technological 
underdevelopment of industry, agriculture, and construction, the 
high concentration of production units in some regions, and the 
underdeveloped infrastructure. 
  In the course of radical reform, Russia encountered new 
processes connected with the destabilization of the financial 
system, the insolvency of enterprises, and the soaring rate of 
inflation, which did much to cause the slump in production and 
investment activity. This, in turn, had a negative effect on 
conservation measures. 
  In 1992 the volume of industrial production in the national 
economy as a whole was 18.8 percent* below the 1991 figure, 
including decreases of 26.8 percent* in nonferrous metallurgy 
and 22.2 percent* in the chemical industry. The substantial 
reduction of output, however, did not result in a comparable 
reduction of environmental pollution. According to the Russian 
State Committee for Statistics, atmospheric emissions within the 
territory of Russia decreased by only 11 percent* in 1992, and 
the reduction in releases of polluted sewage was negligible. 
  Relative indicators of change in the volumes of products and 
services in different regions of the country and indicators of 
emissions and the dumping of pollutants per product cost unit 
are presented in figures 1-5.

  The reasons for this were the increased leniency in the 
oversight of technological regulations in the basic production 
units and in the operation of treatment plants, the 
deterioration of fixed assets in production, including 
resource-conserving assets, the reduction of the output and 
deterioration of the quality of chemical reagents used in the 
treatment of waste gases and liquids, and the unsatisfactory 
performance of environmental monitoring agencies. 
  The depreciation of fixed assets in industry as a whole 
exceeded 50 percent in 1992, and depreciation and the state of 
productive assets reached the critical level in several 
branches--petroleum refining, electrical power engineering, wood 
processing, and the chemical industry. This was the main reason 
why many production units in these branches became potentially 
dangerous sources of accidental environmental pollution. In 
1992, for example, the deterioration of equipment, the low 
technical standards, and the obsolescence of technological 
processes created a critical ecological situation at several 
enterprises of the pulp and paper industry, including the Bratsk 
Timber Industry Complex, the Solombalskiy Pulp and Paper 
Combine, and several other enterprises. 
  Even the meager ``remainder'' financing of environmental 
construction projects in the pre-reform years was diminished in 
1992 by the dramatic decline of investment activity throughout 
the national economy. 
  Total capital investments in environmental construction 
projects in 1992 from all funding sources were almost 20 
percent* below the 1991 figure. The volume of completed 
environmental projects was reduced dramatically. The number of 
new facilities for the decontamination of waste gases in 1992 
was almost 50 percent lower than the figure for the previous 
year. 
  Nongovernmental economic structures continued to play an 
insignificant part in the development of conservation measures, 
although the results of several interesting research and design 
projects in conservation were made available to them. There were 
no perceptible advances in the conservation, protection, and 
reproduction of natural resources in 1992. 
  To a considerable extent, this was due to the insufficient 
efforts in the past year to install a new 
economic-organizational mechanism to monitor resource use, 
particularly on the regional level. On this level, the recording 
and assessment of natural resources have not been organized 
efficiently yet, there has been virtually no progress in 
conducting a comprehensive cadastre, projects in the study and 
reproduction of resources are not being coordinated adequately, 
there are no economic controls over the use of several types of 
resources, and the main shortcoming is the lack of comprehensive 
resource management. The factors contributing to this have 
included the continuous restructuring of government 
administrative bodies, including agencies responsible for the 
management of natural resources, and the incomplete process of 
distinguishing between federal and regional ownership of natural 
resources, which has frequently resulted in the inefficient use 
of resources and the deterioration of natural complexes. 
  All of these statements are corroborated by the contents of 
the report. The purpose of the report is not a mere analysis of 
the ecological situation, however, but also the disclosure of 
the reasons for its present state and some constructive 
proposals on ways of surmounting negative tendencies. This is 
the 
purpose of the rest of this report.

Resources </H6>
<H5>  1.1. Climatic Distinctions of the Year </H5>
  The global warming observed in the northern hemisphere 
reached record levels in 1990 and then decreased in the next two 
years. The average annual air temperature anomaly (in relation 
to the base period of 1951-1980) in the northern hemisphere 
dropped from 0.55 C in 1990 to 0.11 C in 1992 (Figure 
1.1.1). Meanwhile, the average monthly temperature in the 
northern hemisphere was below the norm from July to November. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-06A>           Figure 1.1.1. Regional Mean Anomalies </FIG>



  In the last five years (1988-1992), the average annual 
temperature for Russia as a whole and for the majority of its 
regions (Figure 1.1.2) exceeded the norm (by 1.4 C in 1990, 
the warmest year). The average annual temperature anomaly for 
the Russian Federation dropped from 1.4 C in 1990 to 
0.2 C in 1992. In 1992 air temperature was substantially 
lower in many parts of the country, especially West Siberia and 
the Northeast. The drop in the average annual temperature was 
not as dramatic in Central Asia, Siberia, the cis-Amur and 
Maritime region, and the cis-Baykal and Transbaykal region 
(Figure 1.1.3). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-07A>           Figure 1.1.2. Regional Mean Anomalies </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-08A>           Figure 1.1.3. Regional Mean Anomalies </FIG>



  The winter of 1992 was extraordinarily warm in general, the 
spring was also warm in most regions, air temperature in summer 
was close to the norm, and in fall it was lower than usual 
(figures 1.1.4 and 1.1.5). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-09A>           Figure 1.1.4. Average Monthly Air </FIG>

  Atmospheric precipitation in the Russian Federation and its 
separate regions has been fairly stable in the last 100 years 
(1891-1992): Long-term deviations have been virtually absent in 
annual precipitation and winter and summer precipitation figures. 
  Humidity readings in 1992 were close to the norm in Russia, 
although they did cover a broad range. There was not a single 
case of underprecipitation in the average regional figures and 
there was only one case of excess precipitation, but the eastern 
regions (the cis-Amur and Maritime zone and the Northeast) were 
more likely to experience lighter precipitation, and rainfall 
within the European territory of Russia (ETR) was three times 
the norm. 
<H5>  [No 20, 1993 pp 4-7] </H5>
  Winter rainfall in the cis-Amur and Maritime zone was 15-20 
percent below the norm, and the deficiency of precipitation was 
particularly acute in the Northeast, where it was equivalent to 
almost 70 percent of the norm. Precipitation in the Central and 
Central Chernozem regions, in the Urals, in the south of West 
Siberia, in the south of Krasnoyarsk Kray, in the cis-Baykal and 
Transbaykal zone, and in the south of Amur Oblast was 60-80 
percent below the norm in March, and the figure in the Volga 
lowlands was 6-30 percent, and then in April this was replaced 
by excess moisture equivalent to as much as 120-160 percent of 
the norm, followed by another decrease in May, equivalent to 
60-80 percent of the norm. Monthly atmospheric precipitation 
anomalies in the summer are illustrated in Figure 1.1.6. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-10A>           Figure 1.1.6. Monthly Atmospheric </FIG>



  The distribution of the snow cover on Russian territory in 
spring 1992 deviated substantially from the norm. Conditions 
were particularly divergent in the country's European territory: 
There was very little snowfall (30-50 percent of the norm) in 
the western and southwestern regions, and snowfall figures 
exceeded the norm by 20-60 percent in the northern, eastern, and 
southeastern regions of this territory. 
  The hydrological patterns of rivers and ice conditions were 
irregular and anomalous in 1992. 
  The ice on the Don, the upper reaches of the Volga, and most 
of the rivers in the Volga basin melted 10-20 days earlier than 
usual. The Volga reservoirs were released from the ice early. 
The beginning of the spring ice flow into rivers of the Amur 
basin was exceptionally early. The ice flow began 6-10 days late 
in the upper reaches of the Pechora, Kama, and Lena and the 
middle and lower reaches of the Ob and Irtysh. 
  The high water mark in spring on the rivers of the Don basin 
hit a record low, and the water level in the upper reaches of 
the Volga, the Oka, the rivers of the Tobol basin, and the 
Kolyma was lower than usual. The water level of the Yenisey in 
spring was higher than usual, and it was close to the norm in 
Russia's other rivers. 
  Ice appeared on the Pechora, Northern Dvina, northern 
tributaries of the Volga, and lower reaches of the Yenisey 7-16 
days earlier than usual. Floating ice was seen later than usual 
in the Don and the Volga lowlands, and ice covered the Tsimlyan, 
Saratov, and Volgograd reservoirs later than usual. 
  Ice conditions differed in the non-Arctic seas in the winter 
of 1992-93. Ice formed early on the White Sea. Ice was light in 
the Baltic and Black seas. Conditions were close to the norm in 
the Caspian and Bering seas and the Sea of Japan and lighter 
than the norm in the Sea of Okhotsk. 
  There were 195 extraordinary hydrometeorological events in 
the Russian Federation in 1992, exceeding the average for the 
last seven years. Around half were accompanied by environmental 
damage and economic losses. The temperature frequently rose 
above 30 degrees. The year was distinguished by a well-defined 
summer, light frosts in spring and fall, and snowfall and storms 
in winter. 
<H5>  1.2. Air Quality and Protection </H5>
  Total emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere in 1992 
from stationary sources within the territory of Russia amounted 
to 28.2 million* tonnes, as compared to 31.8 million* in 1991. 
The reduction of 3.6 million* tonnes was mainly due to the 
pervasive slump in industrial production, particularly in the 
extractive and resource-processing branches. The relative 
stability of the extraction and use of gas (an ecologically 
clean fuel) played a positive role under these conditions. 
  Vehicle emissions totaled 22 million tonnes and exceeded the 
1991 figure. The dynamics of emissions of pollutants into the 
atmosphere, based on statistical data, are illustrated in Figure 
1.2.1. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-11A>           Figure 1.2.1. Dynamics of Atmospheric </FIG>



  These data do not include atmospheric emissions produced by 
the operation of road-construction and agricultural equipment, 
air, rail, sea, and river transport, animal husbandry complexes, 
space heaters, fires in garbage dumps and waste disposal sites, 
dust from quarries and other pollution-producing sites, forest 
fires, etc. 
  Figure 1.2.2 illustrates gross emissions of harmful 
substances from stationary sources in the country's economic 
regions in 1992. The strongest anthropogenic influences have 
been recorded in the oblasts making up the Ural economic region 
and the West Siberian, East Siberian, Northern, and Central 
economic zones. An analysis of the situation indicates that air 
pollution is comparatively uniform in the central part of 
Russia, where enterprises of almost all branches of industry are 
located. The amount and nature of air pollution in the eastern 
regions are connected with the presence of large enterprises of 
the metallurgical, gas, and petrochemical branches of industry. 
Emissions from the oil and gas complex that took shape over 
recent decades in Tyumen Oblast are still the main source of 
pollution in the West Siberian economic region and account for 
almost half of all the emissions of enterprises in that region. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-11B>           Figure 1.2.2. Distribution of Gross </FIG>



  Stricter government control revealed previously unrecorded 
sources of pollution and clarified the amount of pollutants 
emitted by previously known sources. This clarification is the 
reason for the higher emission figures in several oblasts and 
republics, including Udmurtia, Khakassia, and Tomsk Oblast. 
  The largest quantities of pollutants entered the atmosphere 
from enterprises of the fuel and energy complex, the 
metallurgical industry, and the petrochemical industry. Figure 
1.2.3 illustrates the distribution of the main elements of 
pollution in the total emissions of all recorded sources. In 
addition to producing the substances listed in the figures, 
enterprises of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy are the main 
sources of copper oxide (90 percent of national emissions), 
cadmium, metallic nickel, hydrogen cyanide, naphthalene, and 
more than 80 percent of emissions containing sulfuric acid, 
fluorides, arsenic, and other substances. Enterprises of the 
chemical and petrochemical industry are the source of 99 percent 
of all carbon disulfide emissions, and 99.8 percent of the 
methyl mercaptan in the atmosphere comes from enterprises of the 
timber industry. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-12A>           Figure 1.2.3. Contribution of Various </FIG>



  The reduction of aircraft emissions has become a primary 
objective in recent years because these now represent almost 44 
percent of total emissions and have displayed a clear tendency 
toward increase. 
  Aircraft emissions exceed 80 percent of gross emissions in 
Krasnodar Kray, Voronezh and Tambov oblasts, the 
Kabardino-Balkar Republic, and the Republic of Mari El. 
Emissions from air transport in Omsk, Krasnodar, Ufa, Tyumen, 
Samara, Nizhniy Novgorod, Voronezh, Volgograd, and Yekaterinburg 
amounted to 100,000-150,000 tonnes in 1991. The highest levels 
were recorded in Moscow (586,200 tonnes), St. Petersburg 
(226,600 tonnes), and Novosibirsk (206,900 tonnes). Air 
transport is responsible for 77-97 percent of the air pollution 
in resort zones like Anapa, Yessentuki, Sochi, and Kislovodsk. 
  According to observations of agencies of the Russian Federal 
Hydrometeorological and Environmental Monitoring Service, the 
1992 average concentrations of one or several pollutants 
exceeded the MAC [maximum allowable concentration] in the air of 
171 cities and was equivalent to 5 times the MAC in 55 cities. 
In 83 cities single incidents of concentrations of certain 
pollutants exceeded public health standards by 10 times, and in 
nine cities the concentration was 50 times the norm. Bratsk, 
Berezniki, Kemerovo, Magnitogorsk, Moscow, Novokuznetsk, Omsk, 
Usolye-Sibirskoye, and other cities are on the list of cities 
with the heaviest air pollution every year. Pollution exceeding 
the maximum and average daily MAC was recorded in 337 cities in 
1992. High levels of air pollution are regularly recorded in the 
following cities: 
  Arkhangelsk, Amursk, Bratsk, Baykalsk, Novodvinsk, and 
Ust-Ilimsk--by methyl mercaptan; 
  Gubakha--by hydrogen sulfide; 
  Volsk--by acetaldehyde; 
  Magnitogorsk--by styrene; 
  Nizhniy Tagil, Chelyabinsk, and Yekaterinburg--by benzpyrene 
(BP); 
  Usolye-Sibirskoye--by mercury; 
  Rudnaya Pristan--by lead; 
  Norilsk--by sulfur dioxide; 
  Omsk--by ethylbenzene; 
  Berezniki, Baykalsk, Balakovo, and Kemerovo--by carbon 
disulfide; 
  Khabarovsk--by formaldehyde; 
  Gubakha and Moscow--by phenol; 
  Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Aleksandrovsk-Sakhalinskiy, and 
Korsakov--by soot; 
  Moscow--by carbon monoxide. 
  Air quality observations in 1988-1992 have recorded the 
reduction of average concentrations of suspended matter, soluble 
sulfates, ammonium, benzpyrene, soot, hydrogen sulfide, and 
formaldehyde as a result of cuts in production and the closure 
of enterprises. Meanwhile, there have been higher average 
concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbon 
disulfide, phenol, and hydrogen fluoride because of the 
irregular operations of enterprises. Higher concentrations of 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and formaldehyde have also 
been recorded on highways in big cities and adjacent 
territories. The highest air pollution index (API exceeding 14) 
in 1992 was recorded in the following 44 cities: Abakan, 
Angarsk, Arkhangelsk, Achinsk, Berezniki, Bratsk, Vladivostok, 
Volzhskiy, Groznyy, Gubakha, Yekaterinburg, Zima, Irkutsk, 
Kamensk-Uralskiy, Kemerovo, Krasnodar, Krasnoyarsk, Kurgan, 
Lipetsk, Magadan, Magnitogorsk, Moscow, Nizhniy Tagil, 
Novodvinsk, Novokuznetsk, Novosibirsk, Novocherkassk, Omsk, 
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Rostov-on-Don, Saratov, Selenginsk, 
Stavropol, Taganrog, Tolyatti, Ulan-Ude, Ulyanovsk, 
Usolye-Sibirskoye, Khabarovsk, Chelyabinsk, Cherepovets, Chita, 
Shelekhov, and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. 
<H5>  Air Pollution Readings in Russia </H5>
  The atmospheric precipitate of chemical compounds in Russia 
can be judged from the observations of stations monitoring the 
pollution of the snow cover. The density of the observation 
network in the ETR and the Urals is one station for every 8,000 
square kilometers, and in the Asian territory of Russia (ATR) it 
is one station for every 30,000 square kilometers. The volume 
and intensity of sulfur and nitrogen precipitate in the country 
in 1992 are presented in Table 1.2.1.

  The distribution of average annual readings of the intensity 
of the atmospheric precipitate of sulfate sulfur and nitrate 
nitrogen and pH values in Russia are illustrated in figures 
1.2.4, 1.2.5, and 1.2.6.

  No significant differences between levels of sulfur and 
nitrogen precipitate in 1992 and the previous year were recorded. 
  The acid content of winter rainfall in the Russian 
Federation 
was negligible. The pH value of the snow pack in most of this 
territory, including urbanized and agricultural regions, ranged 
from 5.5 to 5.7. A higher acid number (pH 4.5-5.5) was recorded 
in winter rains on the Kola peninsula, in the north of the ETR, 
on the eastern slopes of the Urals, and in the west of Taymyr 
and the environs of Lake Baykal and Novosibirsk. 
  The average annual intensity of metal precipitate found in 
snow samples is listed in Table 1.2.2. An analysis of the 
samples indicated that 85-95 percent of all the detected metals 
were in aerosol form and the rest was liquid filtrate. Excessive 
concentrations of metals in precipitation were recorded in areas 
measuring hundreds of square kilometers (and more rarely in 
thousands). Anomalous areas of metal concentration (tens of 
thousands of square kilometers) were located in the large 
industrial centers of the Urals, the central part of the ETR, 
and the Kuzbass.

  Concentrations of cadmium, lead, and selenium were twice as 
high near highways in most cities than in residential 
neighborhoods, regardless of the distinctive features of 
industrial production in these cities. 
<H5>  Background Air Pollution </H5>
  The comprehensive background monitoring network now consists 
of six stations located in biosphere preserves: Central-Forest, 
Oka-Terrace, Voronezh, Astrakhan, and Caucasus. 
  Readings over several years indicate air pollution levels in 
the ETR that are 3-10 times as high as in East Siberia. 
Furthermore, in the case of contaminants undergoing 
transformation in the air (sulfur dioxide and benzpyrene), 
average concentrations generally decrease as the pollutants are 
carried to the south, while average concentrations of dust and 
sulfates generally increase, which is particularly apparent from 
the rise in maximum figures. 
  In 1991 the content of heavy metals in the air in most of 
the 
background territories did not change, and the content of sulfur 
and nitrogen compounds also remained at the 1990 levels. 
Background concentrations of DDT and HCCH pesticides continued 
to decrease, particularly in the south of Russia. BP levels 
remained high in the western regions of the ETR: Up to 70 
percent of the samples taken in the cold season exceeded the 
average daily MAC. The content of pollutants in precipitation in 
the background territories was monitored at 15 stations working 
on regional and international programs. 
  The content of heavy metals in precipitation was also 
approximately the same as it had been the previous year. Data on 
heavy metal precipitate in 1992 in milligrams per square 
kilometer in the year are presented in Table 1.2.3.

  Changes in the lead content of precipitation during the year 
usually correspond to its content in the air (more in winter 
than in the warm season). 
  The overall mineral content of precipitation ranged from 5 
to 
25 mg/liter. The acid type of precipitation was recorded at most 
of the stations in the ETR. Fluctuations in pH values over many 
years display no distinct tendencies and are due to the natural 
variability of processes. There was more acid rain in winter 
than in summer at 64 percent of the stations, because fuel use 
patterns change in winter, tending toward the use of more liquid 
and solid types of fuel with acid-forming components--sulfur and 
nitrogen. Acid rains with a pH value of 3.5 were recorded in 
several background regions on the Valday ridge and in the 
Oka-Terrace biosphere preserve. Precipitation is more alkaline 
as it moves eastward. 
<H5>  The Earth's Ozone Layer </H5>
  Statistical processing of the data of observations in the 
network of ground stations for the measurement of the total 
ozone content (TOC) with Dobson instruments, the M-83/124, and 
the TOMS satellite system indicated a lower TOC both in winter 
and in the spring and summer months in the northern and southern 
hemispheres, with the exception of the tropics. 
  According to satellite observations, the reduction of TOC at 
an altitude of 40 kilometers, which is most vulnerable to the 
influence of the chlorine cycle, was no more than 5 percent 
during the decade, which is approximately half as high as the 
prediction based on simulation models. 
  In general, the winter of 1991-92 was one of the most 
anomalous in the whole period of ozonometric observations. The 
greatest average monthly deviations of TOC were 20 percent in 
January, 15 percent in February, and 20 percent in March. A 
lower TOC began to be recorded over North Asia and Canada in 
February 1992, and the TOC in virtually the whole 45-70 north 
latitude zone was 10-20 percent below the norm in February and 
March. 
  The period from April through August 1992 was also marked by 
a lower TOC figure in virtually all of the territory of the 
former USSR. The greatest deviations from average monthly 
figures (up to 15 percent in April and up to 10 percent in 
May-July) were recorded over the northern ETR, East Siberia, and 
Yakutia. The TOC in August was close to climatic norms. 
  Fall was marked by a somewhat lower TOC, but within the 
range 
of natural variations. 
  Although a lower ozone content over Antarctica was recorded 
last year, this is the fourth year in a row (1989-1992) that the 
``ozone hole'' was as deep and as wide as it was in 1987. The 
absence of quasi-biennial cyclical changes was apparently due to 
the prevailing influence of chemical destruction in comparison 
with dynamic fluctuations. The maximum area with a TOC below 200 
Dobson units was recorded on 27 September 1992 and is estimated 
at 22.6 million square kilometers. 
<H5>  1.3. Water Resources and Their Quality, Protection, and Use </H5>
<H5>  Surface Water </H5>
  The combined flow of all of the rivers in Russia in 1992 was 
5 percent above the average. Regional changes in the flow are 
illustrated in Figure 1.3.1. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-17A>           Figure 1.3.1. Regional Changes in </FIG>



  There was less water in the rivers than in 1991 in almost 
all 
parts of the ETR, with the exception of the north. This tendency 
was apparently connected with the onset of a drought in vast 
areas of the ETR, which could complicate environmental 
conditions and compound the water shortage in the central and 
southern regions. 
  The water level in the Volga River in 1992 was lower than in 
1991 and was almost equivalent to the average. The levels of the 
Don, Dnieper, Ob, and Angara rivers were below the norm. 
  Particularly high water levels were recorded in the rivers 
of 
Karelia and the Kola peninsula (5-20 percent above the norm) and 
rivers in East Siberia (5-11 percent above the norm). The level 
was close to the norm or 1-15 percent below in the rivers of the 
Central Chernozem, North Caucasus, Ural, Volga, and Far Eastern 
economic regions. 
  The reduced flow in the large Russian rivers used 
extensively 
in economic operations now ranges from 10 percent below the norm 
for the Volga River to 15-40 percent for the Don, Kuban, Terek, 
and other rivers. 
  The degradation of small Russian rivers was compounded by 
the 
erosion in drainage areas. In 1992 these processes were most 
intense in the Central, Volga-Vyatka, cis-Volga, West Siberian, 
and East Siberian regions. 
  The amounts of river water used for the regulation of 
supplies in reservoirs were significant: 3.96 km[.sup]3[/] 
removed from the Don River and 0.6 km[.sup]3[/] from the 
Kuban River for accumulation in the Tsimlyanskoye Reservoir, 1.6 
km[.sup]3[/] from the Yenisey River for the replenishment of 
supplies in the Krasnoyarsk Reservoir, and around 0.9 
km[.sup]3[/] from the Volga for the replenishment of water 
reserves in all reservoirs. 
<H5>  Water Use and the Dumping of Polluted Sewage </H5>
  According to state water use records, the total amount of 
water taken out of natural bodies of water in 1992 was 6.3* 
km[.sup]3[/] below the 1991 figure and amounted to 110.7* 
km[.sup]3[/]. The reasons were the slump in production and 
the reduced output of electrical power. The total included 94.4* 
km[.sup]3[/] of fresh water and 5.2* km[.sup]3[/] of sea 
water, and 8.5* km[.sup]3[/] were used for the inter-basin 
and territorial redistribution of supplies. The amount used for 
national economic needs was 90* km[.sup]3[/], including 48.5* 
km[.sup]3[/] for industrial needs, 15.4* km[.sup]3[/] for 
irrigation, 14.7* km[.sup]3[/] for drinking and household 
needs, 4* km[.sup]3[/] for agriculture, and 7.4* 
km[.sup]3[/] for other needs. 
  Changes in water use in 1992 in different regions of the 
Russian Federation in relation to 1991 figures are illustrated 
in Figure 1.3.2. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-17B>           Figure 1.3.2. Changes in Water Use in </FIG>



  In industry, 22 percent* of all of the water used came from 
natural bodies of water, and 78 percent* was recycled (76 
percent* in 1991). The dynamics of water use are presented in 
Figure 1.3.3, and the data on recycled water use are presented 
in Figure 1.3.4. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-18A>           Figure 1.3.3. Dynamics of Water </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-18B>           Figure 1.3.4. Dynamics of Water </FIG>



  Losses of water in transport amounted to 8.4* km[.sup]3[/]. 
  The amount of sewage released into bodies of water in 1992 
was 2.6* km[.sup]3[/] less than in 1991 and totaled 70.6* 
km[.sup]3[/], with 38 percent (27.1* km[.sup]3[/]) falling 
into the category of polluted sewage (untreated or partially 
decontaminated). 
<H5>  [No 21, 1993 pp 4-7] </H5>
  Most of the polluted sewage was dumped by enterprises in 
industry (41.7 percent*) and by public utilities (44.3 
percent*). Polluted sewage dumping in different regions of the 
country and changes in the amounts in 1992 in relation to 1991 
figures are presented in figures 1.3.5 and 1.3.6, and the 
distribution of polluted sewage among the basins of the main 
Russian rivers is illustrated in Figure 1.3.7. The amount of 
polluted sewage dumped in the last six years (in cubic 
kilometers) was 16.7* in 1987, 23.3* in 1988, 27.1* in 1989, 
27.8* in 1990, 28.0* in 1991, and 27.1* in 1992. In the last 
four years the amount of polluted sewage has remained virtually 
the same. The total amount of adequately treated sewage in 1992 
was 2.8* km[.sup]3[/], or 9 percent* of all the sewage 
requiring treatment (30* km[.sup]3[/]). This occurred because 
treatment plants are overloaded and inefficient. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-19A>           Figure 1.3.5. Polluted Sewage Dumped </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-19B>           Figure 1.3.6. Changes in Quantities </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-20A>           Figure 1.3.7. Polluted Sewage Dumped </FIG>



  The amount of water in sewer drains was 2.2* km[.sup]3[/] 
greater than in 1991. 
  The following were dumped into bodies of water along with 
sewage in 1992 (in thousands of tonnes): 
  petroleum products--39.4* 
  suspended matter--1,089.9* 
  common phosphorus--59.8* 
  ammonium nitrogen--187.0* 
  phenols--0.2* 
  synthetic surfactants--8.9* 
  copper compounds--0.9* 
  ferrous compounds--51.2* 
  zinc compounds--1.6* 
  The amount of petroleum products dumped with sewage was 
considerably larger than in 1991. 
<H5>  Surface Water Pollution </H5>
  The quality of water in the majority of bodies of water does 
not meet standard requirements. Observations of surface water 
quality over many years have revealed a tendency toward an 
increase in the number of sites with high pollution levels (over 
10 times the MAC) and extremely high levels (over 100 times the 
MAC). 
  The state of sources of water (surface and subterranean) and 
centralized water supply systems cannot guarantee the required 
quality of drinking water, and in some regions (the Volga 
lowlands, the southern Urals, the Kuzbass, and some northern 
territories) this is jeopardizing human health. 
  Sanitary and epidemiological oversight agencies regularly 
announce high levels of surface water pollution. Their data on 
the sanitary condition of surface water in the locations of 
drinking water supplies are presented in Table 1.3.1. Around a 
third of all the pollutants enter sources of water in rainfall 
and surface runoff from the territories of populated communities 
with unsatisfactory sanitation and of agricultural facilities 
and fields, causing the seasonal deterioration of the quality of 
drinking water that is recorded each year in big cities, 
including Moscow, during the spring rains. This results in the 
excessive chlorination of drinking water, and this is also 
dangerous to human health because of the formation of 
organochlorine compounds.

  The quality of the public supply of drinking water in 1992 
was virtually the same as in 1991: 22.1 percent of the analyzed 
samples did not meet the sanitary-chemical requirements of 
hygienic standards, and 12.3 percent did not satisfy 
microbiological requirements. 
  The drinking water of around a third of the population comes 
from decentralized sources. An analysis of the water in these 
sources indicated that 28 percent of the samples did not satisfy 
the sanitary-chemical requirements and 29.4 percent did not 
satisfy the bacteriological requirements of hygienic standards. 
In general, the drinking water of around 50 percent of the 
population of the Russian Federation still does not satisfy 
certain quality indicators. The situation is particularly 
serious in Arkhangelsk, Kursk, Tomsk, Yaroslavl, Kaluga, and 
Kaliningrad oblasts, Maritime Kray, Kalmykia, Dagestan, and 
Karachay-Cherkessia. 
  It is disturbing that 21.7 percent of the public utilities 
and 20.1 percent of the departmental water systems had to pipe 
water to the public in 1992 without decontaminating it because 
of the lack of special installations. This creates favorable 
conditions for epidemics. 
  From 31 to 64 percent of the sources of drinking water in 
Kaluga, Smolensk, Kursk, Saratov, Kaliningrad, and Chita oblasts 
have no sanitary protective zones. 
  The results of analyses of samples of drinking water from 
public water supplies are presented in Table 1.3.2.

  The unsatisfactory sanitary and chemical state of water 
supply lines and networks leads to the secondary pollution of 
drinking water on its way to the consumer, primarily as a result 
of accidents, which have caused outbreaks of infectious 
diseases. The number of these diseases increased from 9 in 1991 
to 16 in 1992, and the total number of victims was 2,457. Cases 
of infection were recorded in Uglich in Yaroslavl Oblast, in 
Pinega in Arkhangelsk Oblast, in Konakovo in Tver Oblast, and in 
Kiselevsk in Kemerovo Oblast. 
  The state of water supply lines in public recreation areas 
is 
unsatisfactory (Table 1.3.3).

  The details of water use, sewage dumping, and surface water 
quality in the basins of the main rivers and lakes in Russia are 
presented below. 
  The Neva River basin: The provision of industry, 
agriculture, and the population with water is no problem from 
the standpoint of quantity--this requires no more than 1 percent 
of the average annual flow. 
  Releases of polluted sewage, however, have increased each 
year. In 1992, 710,000 tonnes of pollutants were dumped in 
bodies of water in the Neva basin. None of the sewage in this 
basin has been treated adequately. 
  In 1992, 1.5* km[.sup]3[/] of industrial, agricultural, 
and municipal sewage, including 0.35* km[.sup]3[/] of 
polluted sewage, were dumped in Lake Ladoga. In 
addition to the serious pollution in coastal regions, there is 
the severe pollution of Volkhov Cove and the year-round shipping 
lanes in the northern part of the lake. As a result of biogenic 
substances from agricultural lands and facilities, which enter 
the lake mainly in surface runoff, there are signs of 
eutrophication in many parts of the lake. 
  The Dnieper River basin: The upper reaches of the 
river are located in Russia. The amount of fresh water removed 
from this basin in 1992 was 1.07* km[.sup]3[/], and the 
amount used was 1.03 km[.sup]3[/]. 
  The region is distinguished by a high recycling rate--95 
percent* of the water supply. The amount of sewage dumped in the 
river is 0.6* km[.sup]3[/], including 0.3* km[.sup]3[/] of 
polluted sewage. Waste treatment plants can handle 0.5 
km[.sup]3[/], exceeding the amount requiring treatment. The 
quality rating of the water in the Dnieper and Desna rivers in 
Russia ranges from ``clean'' to ``polluted.'' 
  The Don River basin: The amount taken out of the 
river for use is 9.8* km[.sup]3[/] (around 42 percent of the 
average annual flow). Water shortages in the region can be acute 
because up to 50 percent of the water is used during the dry 
season (June-September). 
  In the upper reaches of the river, the section near Donskoy 
is the most highly polluted with nitrogen compounds (up to 10 
times the MAC). The quality of water in the Don lowlands has 
been stabilized, although it is still distinguished by an 
excessive average annual content of nitrites and petroleum 
products (up to six times the MAC) and copper compounds (up to 
eight times the MAC). 
  The water in the Russian part of the Northern Donets River 
is 
rated ``polluted.'' The content of petroleum products, phenols, 
zinc and copper compounds, and other pollutants can be as high 
as 3.5-7 times the MAC in the small rivers of the Don River 
basin. 
  The Kuban River basin: This is one of the regions 
with limited water resources. The amount used each year exceeds 
10* km[.sup]3[/], or 74 percent of the average annual flow. 
More than 1* km[.sup]3[/] is lost during transport. 
  In 1992, 1.8* km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage, containing 
677,000 tonnes of pollutants, was dumped in the Kuban River 
basin. The result is a high level of pollution in several of its 
tributaries and sections of the river near Nevinnomyssk and 
Armavir. 
  There is a higher content of copper and ferrous compounds in 
the upper reaches of tributaries of the Kuban, particularly the 
Uryup River, due to the sewage of ore-dressing combines. An 
excessive nitrite content (up to five times the MAC) was 
recorded in the Kuban River from Karachayevsk to the Krasnodar 
Reservoir. The water in the Krasnodar Reservoir is rated 
``moderately polluted.'' Organic chlorine and phosphorus 
pesticides and 2,4-D-aminosalicylate have been found in this 
water. Pipeline accidents raised the content of petroleum 
products up to 27 times the MAC in the Kuban River near Temryuk. 
  Meanwhile, the content of organic chlorine and phosphorous 
pesticides in the Kuban River delta decreased because of the 
reduced use of these pesticides in agricultural areas of the 
river lowlands in 1992. 
  The Volga River basin: In 1992, 37.3* 
km[.sup]3[/] of fresh water was removed from bodies of water 
here, representing 34 percent* of all the water collected in 
Russia and 14 percent of the annual flow in the river basin. The 
amount of sewage dumped in surface bodies of water here was 22* 
km[.sup]3[/], including 10.7* km[.sup]3[/] of polluted 
sewage. The amount of polluted sewage released in the Volga 
basin represented 39 percent* of all the polluted sewage in 
Russia. 
  The water in the Volga series of reservoirs has high 
concentrations of phenol (2-5 times the MAC), petroleum products 
(3-10 times the MAC), and copper compounds (5-6 times the MAC). 
Nitrogen compounds, methanol, cyanide, and zinc were found in 
the water below Nizhniy Novgorod. 
  The average annual content of ammonium and nitrite nitrogen 
in the Oka River was 2-9 times the MAC, and the content of 
petroleum products was 4-14 times the MAC. The level of water 
pollution by ammonium nitrogen has been stabilized at 6-12 times 
the MAC in the Moscow and Pakhra rivers. Water quality displayed 
serious deterioration in the Klyazma River (near Kovrov) in 
1992, with the average annual content of petroleum products 
recorded at 38 times the MAC within the city limits and 100 
times the MAC downstream from the city. 
  The level of pollution by organochlorine pesticides has been 
too high for several years in the Chapayevka River (in 
Chapayevsk). The water in the Chusovaya River (in Pervouralsk) 
always has excessive levels of copper compounds (57-101 times 
the MAC), zinc (more than 10 times the MAC), and chromium (up to 
20 times the MAC). 
  The Ural River basin: Given the present level of 
water consumption, this is one of the regions with a water 
shortage. Water intake in the basin within Russian territory in 
1992 was 2.9* km[.sup]3[/], representing 35 percent of the 
average flow and equivalent to all of the river flow in dry 
years. Around 2.2* km[.sup]3[/] of sewage, including 0.2* 
km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage, was dumped in surface bodies 
of water in the basin during the year. There was a particularly 
perceptible increase in the amount of ferrous and nitrogen 
compounds dumped in this basin. Excessive concentrations of 
ammonium and nitrite nitrogen, sulfates, chlorides, ferrous 
compounds, and petroleum products have been recorded in the 
water of the Ural River. The most heavily polluted sections of 
the river are near Orsk and Orenburg. The water downstream from 
the sewage drain of the Orsk-Khalilovsk Metallurgical Combine is 
always distinguished by excessive concentrations of petroleum 
products (up to 33 times the MAC) and sporadic high readings of 
phenol (up to 200 times the MAC). The Ilek River, a tributary of 
the Ural, is polluted by hexavalent chromium as a result of 
underground seepage from the storage tanks of plants in 
Aktyubinsk (Kazakhstan). 
  The Terek River basin: Water conditions are 
critical here. Water intake in 1992 amounted to 6.5* 
km[.sup]3[/], or 59.6 percent* of the average annual flow. 
Around 2* km[.sup]3[/] are lost in irrigation supply lines. 
Around 0.6* km[.sup]3[/] of sewage, including 0.4* 
km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage, is dumped into surface 
bodies of water in the basin. The Terek River and its 
tributaries are polluted by ferrous compounds, zinc, ammonium 
nitrogen, and petroleum products, and in terms of degrees of 
pollution the water is rated ``moderately polluted'' and 
``polluted.'' 
  The Pechora River basin: Water intake in 1992 was 
0.57* km[.sup]3[/], or 0.3 percent of the average annual flow. 
  The amount of sewage released into bodies of water in the 
basin in 1992 was 0.48* km[.sup]3[/], including 0.05* 
km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage. The main sources of 
pollution in the rivers of this basin are enterprises of the 
oil, gas, and coal industries and geological prospecting 
organizations. 
  Excessive concentrations of phenol, petroleum products, and 
copper compounds have been recorded all along the river, with 
the highest content, of up to 8-20 times the MAC, near Pechora 
and Vuktyl. 
  The Northern Dvina River basin: Water intake in 
1992 was 1.2* km[.sup]3[/], 81 percent* of which was used for 
industrial purposes. Around 1.0* km[.sup]3[/] of sewage, 
including 0.8* km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage, containing 
1.5 million tonnes of pollutants, was released into the basin. 
  Petroleum products, copper, nitrogen compounds, and certain 
substances characteristic of the sewage of the pulp and paper 
industry--lignosulfanates, formaldehyde, and methanol--are still 
the most prevalent pollutants in the water of the Northern Dvina 
River. 
  Chronically high levels of water pollution are 
characteristic 
of the small rivers of the Kola peninsula in the operational 
zone of the Norilskiy Nikel state concern. The highest 
concentrations of nickel compounds (38-43 times the MAC) have 
been recorded here. The most highly polluted body of water is 
still the Nyuduay River, where critical levels of several copper 
and nickel compounds were found in 1992. 
  The Ob River basin: This river is subject to 
strong anthropogenic influences from its source to its estuary. 
Around 10.5* km[.sup]3[/] of water were taken out of the Ob 
River basin in 1992 for use. Around 7.1* km[.sup]3[/] of 
sewage was dumped in surface bodies of water in the basin. Of 
the total amount, 3.8* km[.sup]3[/] of the sewage required 
treatment, 3.4* km[.sup]3[/] was treated, but only 25 percent 
met standard requirements after treatment. 
  The pollution of the water by phenols and petroleum products 
has been recorded in all sections of the Ob River. The water in 
all sections is rated ``polluted,'' and in some sections it is 
categorized as ``contaminated'' (from Surgut to Polnovat) and 
``highly contaminated'' (in Kolpashevo and Aleksandrovskoye). 
  The average annual concentration of petroleum products in 
some sections of the Irtysh River has risen as high as 56-114 
times the MAC. The water in the Irtysh River near Tobolsk and 
the Tura River near Tyumen is rated ``highly contaminated,'' and 
the water in the Tobol River near Tobolsk is categorized as 
``extremely contaminated.'' 
  The tributaries of the Tobol River are severely polluted. 
The 
highest level of contamination is in the Iset River near 
Yekaterinburg and Aramil. The Miass River (Chelyabinsk) has a 
``highly contaminated'' rating, and the Tura River (Verkhoturye 
and Turinsk) and Salda River, where the average annual content 
of copper compounds reaches 264 times the MAC, are rated 
``extremely contaminated.'' The water in the Nitsa, Neyva, 
Pyshma, Kunara, and Lyalya rivers and the section of the Tagil 
River near Verkhniy Tagil and Nizhniy Tagil is categorized as 
``contaminated'' and ``extremely contaminated.'' 
  The Yenisey River basin: The amount of water taken 
out of water sources in the Yenisey basin for economic and 
household use in 1992 was 0.6* km[.sup]3[/] less than in 1991 
and totaled 4.97* km[.sup]3[/]. Around 3.9* km[.sup]3[/] 
of sewage was dumped into surface bodies of water in the basin, 
2.34* km[.sup]3[/] required treatment, 1.33* km[.sup]3[/] 
underwent decontamination treatment, and only 1.1 percent* was 
treated adequately. Around 62 percent of all the polluted sewage 
entering the Yenisey River basin comes from the Angara River 
basin. Waste treatment plants in this region are capable of 
handling 1.4 km[.sup]3[/], but only 0.35 percent of them are 
operating efficiently. 
  The most prevalent substances polluting the water in the 
basin are petroleum products, phenols, copper compounds, zinc, 
and others. Average annual concentrations of petroleum products 
reached 13-15 times the MAC in the upper and middle reaches of 
the Yenisey, and hydrocarbons, resins, and asphaltenes were 
found in the water near Kyzyl. 
  Water pollution is more intense downstream. Whereas the 
water 
in the upper reaches of the Yenisey is rated ``contaminated,'' 
certain sections in the lowlands are categorized as ``highly 
contaminated.'' 
  Extremely high levels of methyl mercaptan and hydrogen 
sulfide (hundreds of times the MAC) and high levels of lignin, 
cyanide, rhodanine, and petroleum products have been more common 
in the Angara River in recent years. The pollution rating of the 
water in the Angara River and its tributaries ranges from 
``polluted'' to ``highly contaminated.'' 
  The Lake Baykal basin: Sewage releases in 1992 
were the same as in 1991 and amounted to 0.23* km[.sup]3[/]. 
Although the capacity of sewage treatment plants exceeds the 
quantity of polluted sewage requiring treatment, only 11 
percent* of the treated sewage satisfies standard requirements. 
  The main sources of pollution in the lake are still the 
Selenginsk TsKK [Pulp and Cardboard Combine] and Baykalsk TsBK 
[pulp and paper combine]. Almost 70 percent of their sewage 
consists of decomposition-resistant organic substances. 
  The pollutants released into the lake with the sewage of the 
Baykalsk TsBK in 1992 surpassed all recorded indicators in 1991, 
including a 37-percent increase in phenols, an increase of 19 
percent in chlorides, and an increase of 5 percent in 
oxidation-resistant organic substances. 
  The sewage dumped in the Lake Baykal basin in 1992 included 
26,000* tonnes of sulfates, 18,000* tonnes of chlorides, 1,000* 
tonnes of nitrates, 350* tonnes of synthetic surfactants, 170* 
tonnes of common phosphorus, around 1* tonne of phenol, and 
large quantities of other pollutants. 
  Concentrations of petroleum products and phenols were higher 
in all of the large tributaries of Lake Baykal in 1992, and this 
increased the content of these substances in the lake. The 
largest increases in petroleum products and sulfates were 
recorded in the southern part of the lake. 
  The Lena River basin: In 1992, just as in previous 
years, the amount of water used for economic purposes 
represented only a negligible part of available resources and 
amounted to 0.39* km[.sup]3[/], which was 2 percent* below 
the 1991 figure. Around 0.25* km[.sup]3[/] of sewage was 
released into surface bodies of water in the basin. Around 0.18* 
km[.sup]3[/] of the sewage required treatment, and 26 
percent* satisfied standard requirements after treatment. 
  Most of the rivers in the Lena River basin are categorized 
as 
``moderately polluted'' bodies of water, with an average annual 
pollutant content of no more than 5-10 times the MAC. 
  The highest phenol content (up to 17 times the MAC) in the 
Lena River is usually recorded during spring floods and is due 
to anthropogenic influences and to natural processes. The 
readings of up to 12-16 times the MAC for copper compounds are 
due to the solubility of the minerals lining the river bed and 
the partial thawing of permafrost. 
  The Kolyma River basin: The main source of the 
suspended matter, petroleum products, phenols, and ammonium 
nitrogen in the water of the Kolyma River and its tributaries is 
the sewage of Glavalmazzoloto enterprises and public utilities. 
  The highest levels of pollution in the Kolyma River and the 
other rivers of this basin are recorded during the spring 
floods, when the maximum concentration of suspended matter rises 
as high as 123-414 mg/l, the level of copper compounds is 70 
times the MAC, and the level of ammonium nitrogen is 9 times the 
MAC. 
  The Amur River basin: In spite of the relatively 
small quantities of water removed from the Amur River for 
economic and household use (1.34* km[.sup]3[/], or 0.03 
percent* of the average monthly flow), 0.88* km[.sup]3[/] of 
sewage was dumped into this basin in 1992. Around 0.65* 
km[.sup]3[/] required treatment, and only 5 percent* 
satisfied standard requirements after treatment. 
  The quality rating of the water in the Amur River changes 
from ``moderately polluted'' to ``highly contaminated'' as the 
water flow downstream. The highest levels of pollution are near 
the rural community of Bogorodskoye and the city of Nikolayevsk, 
where maximum concentrations of copper compounds reach 80 times 
the MAC, the zinc content is 56 times the MAC, and the phenol 
content is 90 times the MAC. The average level of copper 
compounds in the Kholdomi and Silinka rivers reached 21-57 times 
the MAC and the zinc content reached 21-71 times the MAC, with 
respective maximums of 250 and 120 times the MAC. 
  The Ussuri River has a ``moderately polluted'' rating, and 
sections of its tributaries are rated ``contaminated'' or 
``highly contaminated.'' 
  Phenols are the most common pollutant in the rivers of the 
Kamchatka peninsula. The content of these reaches 3-7 
times the MAC. Maximum concentrations of phenol were as high as 
20-26 times the MAC in some of these rivers during the spring 
floods of 1992. Enterprises of the woodworking industry, timber 
rafting, and the swamp waters of the West Kamchatka Plain are 
the main sources of phenols. 
  The content of other pollutants is negligible and generally 
stays within the limits of the MAC. Most of the bodies of water 
on the peninsula have a ``clean'' rating, and only a few are 
rated ``moderately polluted.'' 
  Most of the rivers of Sakhalin Island have a 
``moderately contaminated'' rating, and the average annual 
content of pollutants in the water does not exceed 4-5 times the 
MAC. The Okhinka River (in Okha) is rated ``highly 
contaminated,'' with an average annual petroleum product content 
of 26 times the MAC and a maximum content of 49 times the MAC. 
<H5>  The Seas </H5>
  All of the inland and land-locked seas in Russia are exposed 
to intense anthropogenic influences in their water and in their 
catchment basins. 
  Water pollution levels are monitored in all of the inland 
and 
land-locked seas. The degree of pollution is measured by a 
7-point scale of water quality, ranging from ``very clean'' to 
``extremely contaminated.'' 
  Quantities of sewage released into the seas of the Russian 
Federation in 1992 are presented in Table 1.3.4.

  Processes of attrition were characteristic of coastal areas, 
and more than 60 percent of the coastline is suffering from 
destruction, erosion, and submersion. This is inflicting 
considerable damage on the national economy and is another 
source of marine pollution. 
  The Azov Sea is the most shallow and ecologically 
vulnerable of the inland seas. The development of its ecosystem 
depends on the water level of the rivers flowing into it and on 
water exchange with the Black Sea. The Azov Sea is distinguished 
by intensive shipping, a high concentration of industry, and 
high population density on the coastal strip and throughout the 
territory of its basin. 
  Most of the pollutants in the sea are carried by the runoff 
of the Don and Kuban rivers and the sewage of enterprises in 
industry, including the fish industry, public utilities, 
construction, and agriculture. 
  The level of pollution in the coastal regions of the eastern 
part of the sea remained stable from 1987 to 1991, but higher 
concentrations of pollutants were recorded in 1992, resulting in 
the deterioration of water quality in all of the monitored 
regions. Average levels of twice the MAC and maximum levels of 
5-6 times the MAC of dissolved mercury were found, just as they 
had been in 1991, on the surface of Taganrog Bay and in the Don 
River estuary. Severe mercury pollution was also recorded in 
Temryuk Bay (up to three times the MAC). Hydrometeorological 
conditions were the reason for two cases of oxygen deficiency at 
the bottom of Temryuk Bay on the shore of the Kuban River. The 
reduction of the oxygen content on the shoreline of the Kuban 
River and in its channel was measured at 6-7 percent in 1992. 
  Black Sea: The coastal waters of Krasnodar Kray 
were rated ``moderately polluted.'' The main pollutants in this 
region were petroleum hydrocarbons. The level of these had 
reached nine times the MAC in the ports of Tuapse and 
Novorossiysk in 1991. Accidents on maritime vessels were the 
main cause of this kind of pollution. 
  Caspian Sea: The water level and ecological state 
of the largest inland drainage basin depend on surface runoff, 
mainly from the Volga River, evaporation, and economic 
activities in the water and the catchment basin. The water level 
has been rising recently. In 1992 the average level was 27.04 
meters (as of 1 January 1993), displaying an average rise of 15 
centimeters. 
  A steady tendency toward higher levels of pollution in the 
Russian parts of the North Caspian was recorded from 1986 to 
1992. The rate of pollution stabilized in 1992. We can expect 
the rising water level to increase the pollution in the Volga 
River delta. The level of pollution is rising because the 
accumulated sediment in parts of the delta is releasing more 
pollutants. The water in the western part of the North Caspian 
is categorized as ``contaminated,'' and the water in other 
regions has a ``polluted'' rating, and a steady increase in 
pollution has been recorded there. 
  The improvement of ecological conditions in the North 
Caspian 
will require a broad-scale program for more efficient water use 
in the Volga River basin, which is the main source of the 
pollution. A tendency toward lower levels of pollution and the 
subsequent stabilization of this level were recorded in the 
North Caspian from 1989 to 1992, and the water there has been 
categorized as ``polluted'' for the last three years. 
  Baltic Sea: The most highly polluted regions are 
the Neva Gulf and Vyborg Cove, where the water is rated ``highly 
contaminated'' and ``contaminated.'' 
  In 1992 the average content of phenol rose to 4-7 times the 
MAC in all parts of the sea. In the Neva Gulf the concentration 
of copper reached 19 times the MAC and manganese and lead levels 
exceeded the MAC. 
  There was a tendency toward increased water pollution in 
Kursk Gulf and the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland. 
  Barents Sea: The open expanses and coastal zones 
of the sea are rated ``clean'' or ``very clean,'' with the 
exception of the Kola Inlet. There is always a thin layer of 
petroleum products on the surface of the water in the regions of 
intense shipping. The water in the White Sea is still 
basically clean. 
  Arctic seas: The vulnerability of marine 
ecosystems in the Arctic basin is due to the inadequate ability 
of the cold water to cleanse itself of pollutants carried by 
river discharge. The main sources of pollution here are the Ob, 
Yenisey, Lena, and Kolyma rivers. Most of the pollutants 
accumulate in the river estuaries. Pollutants are also carried 
along the periphery of the whole Arctic basin toward Alaska by 
circumpolar currents. 
  The sources of pollution are enterprises of nonferrous 
metallurgy, electrical power engineering, and public utilities. 
In addition, large quantities of radioactive substances have 
been submerged in the Barents and Kara seas. 
  The combined activity of the liquid radioactive waste (LRW) 
dumped in the northern seas is 24.4 kc. Most of it was dumped in 
the Barents Sea (12.844 kc) and the Kara Sea (11.5 kc). Most of 
the solid radioactive waste (SRW) submerged in the northern seas 
consisted of cold waste and medium-activity waste. Total 
activity is 40 c in the Barents Sea and over 15 kc in the Kara 
Sea. In 1992, 3,066 m[.sup]3[/] of LRW with activity of 18 c 
was dumped in the northern seas. 
  Radiation readings in the SRW burial sites (prior to 1967) 
and the LRW dump sites (prior to 1990) registered no cases of 
dangerous radioactive pollution directly in the disposal sites 
and the surrounding water. For the last 25 years, however, 
radiation levels have not been measured directly in the SRW 
disposal sites. 
  Far Eastern seas: Hydrological conditions in these 
deep seas depend on water exchange with the Pacific Ocean. 
Pollutants accumulate mainly on the continental shelf. The 
sources of pollution in the Far Eastern seas are enterprises of 
electrical power engineering, the oil and gas industry, and 
public utilities. 
  Water quality in the northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk, in 
Nagayev and Gertner bays (Tauyskaya Inlet), was rated 
``moderately polluted'' in 1991 and 1992. No tendency toward 
pollution has been observed in the open expanses of the 
Tauyskaya Inlet in the past five years. According to available 
data, there are no indications of any such tendency in the 
southwestern part of the sea (the shelf of Sakhalin Island). We 
can say without any hesitation, however, that the environs of 
the settlement of Starodubskiy are always the most critical 
site: The water there is rated ``contaminated,'' and it is 
``highly contaminated'' in the harbor. Phenol levels have risen 
to 45 times the MAC. 
  In Petr Velikiy Gulf in the Sea of Japan, the level of 
pollution has been stabilized since 1989 in Zolotoy Rog Bay and 
in Amursk and Ussuriysk gulfs, where water quality is always 
rated ``polluted'' or ``contaminated.'' The content of dissolved 
oxygen has occasionally decreased in Zolotoy Rog Bay. The most 
highly polluted part of the Tatar Strait is always the area near 
Aleksandrovka. 
<H5>  Ground Water Use and Pollution </H5>
  Exploratory projects in Russia (in 1992) revealed the 
locations of 3,196 underground sources of potable water and 
water for the production sphere and for irrigation, with 
combined reserves of 26.7 km[.sup]3[/] a year. The sources of 
around 18.2 km[.sup]3[/] a year are ready for commercial use. 
The federation average for the use of these reserves does not 
exceed 33 percent. 
  The amount of ground water used in 1992 was 11.9* 
km[.sup]3[/], 75 percent in households, 21 percent in 
production, and 4 percent in the irrigation of fields and 
pastures. 
  Subterranean sources of water (particularly in the water 
table closest to the surface) are polluted by man's economic 
activities along with the other elements of the environment. 
According to the geological organizations of Roskomnedra [RF 
State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources], 
around 760 sites of ground water pollution have been discovered, 
and they have displayed steady levels of pollution for several 
years. They include 70 potable water intakes in Ufa, Tula, Orel, 
Tambov, Kamensk-Shakhtinskiy, and other cities where the 
deterioration of water quality has been recorded. Pollution in 
320 areas is connected with the activities of industrial 
enterprises. 
  The most common sources of ground water pollution are oil 
fields, mining enterprises, leach fields, the slurry tanks and 
scrap heaps of metallurgical plants, chemical waste and 
fertilizer storage tanks, garbage dumps, animal husbandry 
complexes, and residential communities with no sewers. Sites of 
ground water pollution now cover hundreds of square kilometers. 
  The most common substances polluting the ground water are 
petroleum products, phenols, heavy metals (copper, zinc, lead, 
cadmium, nickel, and mercury), sulfates, chlorides, and nitrogen 
compounds. The intensity of pollution in 30 percent of the known 
sites of ground water pollution ranges from 10 to 100 times the 
MAC, and the level of various substances in 12 percent of the 
locations exceeds 100 times the MAC. 
  There is no standard list of substances to be monitored in 
ground water, and this precludes the compilation of a precise 
map of ground water pollution. 
<H5>  1.4. Land Resources and Their Quality, Protection, and Use </H5>
  Russia's land resources in 1992 amounted to 1,709,600,000* 
hectares, including: 
  -- the land of agricultural enterprises and citizens--651 
million* hectares (38.1 percent*); 
  -- the land of populated communities--6.2 million* hectares 
(0.4 percent*); 
  -- the land used for industry, transportation, 
communications, and other nonagricultural purposes--17.7 
million* hectares (1.2 percent*); 
  -- the land of natural preserves--20.7 million* hectares 
(1.2 
percent*); 
  -- the land of forests--878.1 million* hectares (51.4 
percent*); 
  -- the land of water resources--18.1 million* hectares (1 
percent*); 
  -- reserve lands--117.8 million* hectares (6.9 percent*). 
  Changes in the structure of agricultural land resources are 
interesting (Table 1.4.1).

  As Table 1.4.1 indicates, agricultural land represents 13 
percent of all land resources (222.3 million* hectares). 
  Figure 1.4.1 illustrates the share of total land resources 
occupied by plowed fields. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-28A>           Figure 1.4.1. Percentage of Total </FIG>



  The area of agricultural land decreased by 12.4 million* 
hectares in the last 27 years, including a decrease of 2.3 
million* hectares in plowed fields and 10.6 million* hectares in 
hayfields. The reasons for the reduction of agricultural area 
are the destruction and degradation of topsoil and the inclusion 
of some agricultural land in the territory of cities, 
settlements, and industrial enterprises. 
  Changes in the plowed area in different parts of the Russian 
Federation are presented in Figure 1.4.2. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-28B>           Figure 1.4.2. Changes in 1992 Plowed </FIG>



  Russia's chernozem soils cover an area of around 120 million 
hectares. This is only around 7 percent of the total area, but 
this is the location of more than half of all the plowed fields 
and the source of around 80 percent of all farming products. 
  The distribution of agricultural soils is presented in Table 
1.4.2.

<H5>  [No 22, 1993 pp 4-9] </H5>
  Erosion-prone and eroded agricultural land covers an area of 
124 million hectares (56 percent), including 87.3 million 
hectares of plowed fields. According to 1990 state records, 
gullies covered an area of 2.4 million hectares, 26.2 million 
hectares of plowed fields (20.4 percent) were located on eroded 
soils, 2.1 million hectares (1.7 percent) had suffered from the 
combined effects of water and wind erosion, 7.9 million hectares 
(6.1 percent) had been damaged by wind erosion, and all of the 
land prone to wind erosion covered an area of 44 million 
hectares (32.2 percent). Areas of eroded chernozems are growing. 
In the last 15-20 years they have increased by an average of 
250,000-300,000 hectares a year. In many locations with 
chernozem soils, 50 percent or more of the plowed area is 
eroded. The growth of gullies results in the loss of 
25,000-30,000 hectares of chernozem each year. 
  Soil protection efforts have decreased in recent years. 
Shallow cultivation with the retention of stubble on the surface 
was conducted on an area of 19.7 million hectares and 
cross-plowing on inclines was conducted on 13.7 million hectares 
in 1991. These figures were below the 1988 figures by 8.6 
million and 5.9 hectares respectively. Protective forest strips 
were planted on 16,100 fewer hectares in 1992 than in 1991. 
  The productivity of soil is declining in large areas as a 
result of the lower humus content. The supply was reduced by 
25-30 percent in just the last 20 years, and average annual 
losses in the Russian Federation as a whole amount to 81.4 
million tonnes. According to the data of agrochemical 
inspections, 16.5 million hectares of plowed fields in Russia 
are distinguished by an extremely low humus content, and another 
21 million hectares have a low content. The humus content of 
chernozems in the central chernozem oblasts has been reduced by 
almost half in the last 100 years--declining from 10-14 percent 
to 7-10 percent, and annual losses of humus in chernozem soils 
average 0.5-1.0 tonnes per hectare. 
  The area of reclaimed land in an unsatisfactory state has 
been reduced by 105,000 hectares in the Russian Federation as a 
whole. Around 771,000 hectares of irrigated land is in an 
unsatisfactory state, including 325,000 hectares where the water 
table is too deep, 292,000 hectares damaged by salinization, and 
154,000 hectares suffering from a combination of these two 
factors. The total area of saline lands is 38.4 million hectares 
(19.9 percent of all agricultural land), including 25.6 million 
hectares of alkaline-saline soils. Plowed fields with saline 
soils cover an area of 12.9 million hectares. 
  Waterlogged and boggy areas used as plowland are increasing. 
In 1990 they covered 8 million hectares (5.2 percent of the 
plowed fields), whereas there were 5.8 million hectares (or 4.5 
percent) in 1985. 
  Desertification has damaged 4.9 million hectares in 
Kalmykia, 
and 1.8 million of these are in a state of extreme 
desertification. Degraded pastures in Astrakhan Oblast cover an 
area of 1.3 million hectares, including 250,000 hectares of 
shifting sands. Severely and moderately eroded lands occupy 48 
percent of all the pastures. 
  The degradation of pastures also occurs in the tundra zone 
as 
a result of parching, the destruction of the soil cover and the 
vegetative cover during the broad-scale exploitation of mineral 
deposits and the use of the pastures by motor vehicles in 
locations without proper roads, and the overgrazing of 
livestock. Between 1965 and 1990 the area of reindeer grazing 
lands decreased by 20.2 million* hectares. 
  The total area of land damaged by mining, construction, and 
geological prospecting amounted to 1.1 million hectares in 1991, 
including 700,000 hectares damaged between 1976 and 1991. More 
than 50 percent of the area was occupied by agricultural land. 
During this period, 1,341,700 hectares of damaged lands were 
recultivated. 
<H5>  Pollution of the Soil With Pesticides </H5>
  The quantity of pesticides used in agriculture each year did 
not change between 1980 and 1991 and amounted to approximately 
150,000 tonnes. The figure decreased to 100,000 tonnes in 1992. 
  The use of pesticides in the different economic regions of 
the Russian Federation in 1992 is illustrated in Figure 1.4.3. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-30A>           Figure 1.4.3. Use of Pesticides in RF </FIG>



  In Russia as a whole in 1992, soil polluted by pesticides 
was 
found in 5.8 percent of the monitored area of 29,800 hectares in 
spring and in 9.3 percent of the monitored area of 32,000 
hectares in fall. Lower levels of pesticides were recorded in 
the soils of Omsk Oblast in 1992, but the rate of soil pollution 
remained the same in Maritime Kray and Irkutsk, Samara, Rostov, 
and Moscow oblasts. The soil of orchards and forests 
(representing 37-52 percent of the monitored area) was the most 
highly contaminated by pesticide residue (mainly DDT). Fields of 
vegetable crops were polluted by the residue of DDT, 2,4-D, and 
trephalan on 17.7 percent of the area; the soil of grain fields 
was polluted by DDT, HCCH, 2,4-D, propazine, trephalan, and TCNP 
on 11.3 percent of the area. The regions with high levels of 
pollution include Moscow and Irkutsk oblasts, and average levels 
were found in the soils of the Central-Chernozem Region, 
Maritime Kray, the North Caucasus, and Kurgan Oblast. 
Territories with little pollution included Omsk Oblast and all 
but a few oblasts of the Upper Volga and cis-Volga regions. 
<H5>  Pollution of Soils by Toxic Substances of Industrial Origin </H5>
  According to the data of aerospace mapping, the zones of 
dispersion of technogenic emissions around industrial complexes 
cover an area of 18 million hectares, or 1 percent of the total 
area of the Russian Federation. 
  Emissions of pollutants from stationary sources per unit of 
area are illustrated in Figure 1.4.4. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-30B>           Figure 1.4.4. Harmful Emissions from </FIG>



  Although the average maximum figure is 0.2-0.23 
tonnes/km[.sup]2[/], local figures can reach as high as 10 
tonnes/km[.sup]2[/] (in the Ural, Central, and 
Central-Chernozem economic regions). 
  The area of the soil cover polluted by heavy metals and 
fluorine has been estimated at 3.579 billion hectares. 
Territories with a highly polluted soil cover (from 10 to 100 
times the background level) cover an area of 253 million 
hectares. 
  In all of the territories surveyed in 1992, the highest 
level 
of pollution by heavy metals were found in the soil in the 
5-kilometer zone around the city of Rudnaya Pristan, the grounds 
of enterprises in Svirsk and Verkhnyaya Pyshma, and the soils of 
Irkutsk, Cheremkhovo, and Nizhneudinsk. 
  Lead in excess of 10 times the MAC was found in the soils of 
Irkutsk, Svirsk, Rudnaya Pristan, Kamensk-Uralskiy, and 
Cheremkhovo. 
  A copper content 10 times as high as the average was found 
in 
the soil of Zavolzhye, Nizhniy Novgorod, Kirov, Tomsk, and 
Rudnaya Pristan. 
  Vanadium levels exceeding 10 times the MAC were recorded in 
Kirov and Nizhniy Novgorod. 
  Fluorine pollutes the soils around enterprises of the 
aluminum industry in Krasnoturyinsk, Bratsk, Novokuznetsk, 
Volgograd, and Krasnoyarsk. The maximum concentration of total 
fluorine in the soils of these regions is 4-10 times the 
background level, and the level of water-soluble fluorine is 
10-30 times the MAC. 
  The density of atmospheric fluoride precipitation in 1991 
was 
1.5 times as high as the 1983 figure around the Bratsk Aluminum 
Plant, and 4 times the 1983 figure near the Irkutsk plant. 
  The petroleum content of soil in locations of oil 
extraction, 
refining, transport, and distribution is dozens of times as high 
as the background level. 
  The average content of petroleum products in the soils of 
Avtozavodskiy Rayon in Nizhniy Novgorod in 1992 was four times 
as high as the background level, and the content in 7 percent of 
the samples was 10 times as high. The content of petroleum in 
the soil 10 kilometers east and west of Vladimir was 33 times as 
high as the background level. 
  The petroleum content of the grounds of a refinery in 
Volgograd was 13 times as high as the background level, and it 
was 3-19 times as high in the soil of the Omsk Fuel and 
Lubricant Depot. 
<H5>  1.5. Mineral Use and Protection of Mineral Resources </H5>
  Russia ranks high in the world in terms of mineral resource 
potential. The State Commission on Commercial Mineral Deposits 
has approved around 90 percent of all known deposits and 
confirmed their reliability, profitability, and readiness for 
industrial exploitation. 
  Lead, tungsten, antimony, mercury, load and placer gold, 
silver, and phosphorite resources, however, are limited. There 
are almost no reserves of high-grade manganese, chromite, and 
kaolin ore, barite, graphite, and native sulfur. 
  The sharp cuts in exploratory and geological work in the 
last 
five years reduced the Russian Federation's state reserves of 
coal, chromites, lead, nickel in rich sulfide and silicate ores, 
antimony, mercury, platinum, silver, phosphorite, and fluorspar. 
The increase in stocks of bauxite, tin, molybdenum, diamonds, 
barite, apatite, phosphorite, asbestos, and potash salts in 1992 
was not equivalent to the annual output. 
  Although the projected resources of the main types of crude 
minerals are two or three times as great as known reserves, most 
of them are of inferior quality and are located in worse 
geographic and economic conditions. 
  Most of the deposits being worked at this time have large 
stocks of ore of fairly good quality. Stocks of aluminum, lead, 
molybdenum, tungsten, and several nonmetalliferous commercial 
minerals, however, are inferior to foreign supplies. 
  The intensive exploitation of deposits is depleting the 
resource base of many mining enterprises in the old mining 
regions. Iron ore enterprises in the Urals and West Siberia, 
copper, nickel, and bauxite enterprises in the Urals, lead and 
zinc enterprises in the North Caucasus, Transbaykal, and the Far 
East, tin ore enterprises in Maritime and Khabarovsk krays and 
Chukotka, diamond mining enterprises in Yakutia, and most of the 
gold mining enterprises in Siberia cannot develop the necessary 
capacity either because of inadequate resource reserves or 
because of the difficulty of extracting remaining supplies. 
  The output of almost all types of crude minerals has 
decreased since the end of the 1980s, particularly the output of 
oil and coal (Table 1.5.1).

** Including gas condensate. 


  The reduced output of oil and the lower growth rate in gas 
production are the result of the protracted intensive 
exploitation of highly productive deposits with essentially 
unique reserves and of cuts in capital investments in 
hydrocarbon extraction. 
  Losses of some types of commercial minerals during 
extraction 
and processing are still high. Particularly large quantities are 
lost in the earth in the underground mining of coal (25.7 
percent), including coking coal (18.3 percent), chromium ore 
(27.7 percent), and potash salts (60.1 percent). Losses of 
extracted minerals during processing include more than a third 
of the tin, around one-fourth of the iron, tungsten, molybdenum, 
potassium oxide, and phosphorus pentoxide from phosphorite ores, 
and one-fifth of the lead and zinc. Although the final 
extraction yields in 1992 were higher than the 1991 figures by 
1.4 percent for coking coal, 0.4 percent for iron ore, 0.3 
percent for tungsten-molybdenum ore, and 2.5 percent for potash 
salts, and although concentration recovery figures were 1.9 
percent higher for iron, 1.4 percent higher for zinc, and 0.8 
percent higher for tin, the yield of the majority of commercial 
minerals was nevertheless smaller than in 1987 (tables 1.5.2 and 
1.5.3).

  Complete raw material use is still at a low level. 
Enterprises of the Apatit Association in Murmansk Oblast recover 
only 40 percent of the potential value of apatite-nepheline ore 
in their commercial product. Thousands of tonnes of nepheline 
and titanium are lost with the tailings. The oxidized 
ferruginous quartzite extracted along with ores by mining 
enterprises of the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly are not processed and 
are kept in scrap heaps. Copper, cobalt, and sulfur are not 
recovered from the iron ore in some deposits, noble and 
nonferrous metals and trace elements are not recovered from the 
pyrite concentrates of copper pyrite deposits treated with 
sulfuric acid, and nonferrous metals are not recovered during 
the dressing of tin ores.

  Around 8.2 billion m[.sup]3[/] of casing-head gas burned 
in 1992. The use of this gas during oil extraction was just as 
unsatisfactory as it had been the year before. Losses of sulfur 
from fuel gas and of helium and ethane from natural gas 
increased. 
  The accumulated waste products (45 billion tonnes) of 
ore-dressing enterprises (including more than 10 billion tonnes 
at enterprises of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy) are not 
being put to satisfactory use. 
  Enterprises were more inclined to practice the selective 
working of the best sections of deposits, which led to the 
accumulation of underground stocks of commercial minerals of 
inferior quality: the Norilskiy Nikel concern (Krasnoyarsk 
Kray), the Tyrnyauz Tungsten-Molybdenum combine 
(Kabardino-Balkar Republic), and the Gaysk Ore-Dressing Combine 
(GOK) (Orenburg Oblast). 
  Because mineral extraction and processing facilities are 
having a destructive effect on the environment, the intelligent 
and comprehensive use of mineral resources is a priority of 
environmental protection in the locations of mining enterprises. 
  The development of the sites of mineral deposits is an acute 
problem in several mining regions. In the Kuzbass, for example, 
each year the sites of coal deposits are developed, but the 
reserves in these deposits exceed 100 million tonnes, and this 
will complicate the working of these deposits in the future. 
Construction projects on the sites of potash salt deposits in 
the damaged left-bank section of the city of Berezniki have 
continued. This problem has to be solved on the federal level, 
specifically by the legislative restriction of construction in 
mining regions. 
  Therefore, the state of affairs in the use of the crude 
mineral base and the protection of mineral resources is still on 
the verge of rapid deterioration. 
  The resolution of many problems in the protection of mineral 
resources is connected directly with the need to improve 
existing laws on mineral resources and the creation of an 
economic mechanism for the intelligent use of these resources. 
  In addition to the unsatisfactory use of commercial minerals 
during the stages of extraction and processing, the prospecting 
and exploitation of deposits can cause irreversible changes in 
the landscape, the appropriation of land, the disruption of 
hydrological patterns, and the pollution of the environment. 
There is a great risk of ecological catastrophes at the time of 
accidents accompanied by emissions, oil spills, and fires in gas 
and oil wells and coal mines. 
<H5>  1.6. Forests and Their Use, Reproduction, and Protection </H5>
  The total area of Russia's forests amounts to 1,182,600,000* 
hectares, including 771 million* hectares of dense forests (65 
percent of the total) with timber reserves of 81.6 billion* 
m[.sup]3[/] (according to forest inventory records). The 
distribution of dense forests in different regions of Russia is 
illustrated in Figure 1.6.1. Russia's forests are mainly 
coniferous--78 percent* (cedar--6.2 percent*), deciduous 
softwood--19 percent*, and deciduous hardwood--3 percent*. The 
total forested area suitable for exploitation (logging 
operations) covers 388.5 million* hectares, or 38 percent* of 
the total, with timber reserves of 47.6 billion* m[.sup]3[/] 
(66 percent*). The area of mature and overmature trees covers 
183.3 million* hectares, with reserves of 29.1 billion* 
m[.sup]3[/]. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-34A>           Figure 1.6.1. Densely Wooded Area </FIG>



  The felling limit (or consumption standard) in the Russian 
Federation as a whole was 542.5 million* m[.sup]3[/] in 1992, 
including 330.2 million* m[.sup]3[/] of conifers. The 
overfelling of conifers, by 1.7 million* m[.sup]3[/], was 
recorded only in Arkhangelsk Oblast. This was done with the 
permission of the oblast administration. 
  The public felling area has decreased from 2 million 
hectares 
in 1988 to 1.4 million* hectares (see Table 1.6.1). There have 
been no significant changes in cutting methods and technologies. 
Clear-cutting is still practiced on around 90 percent* of the 
total cutting area.

  Forest fires are still causing colossal damage to forests 
(Table 1.6.3). The area consumed by these fires has recently 
exceeded a million hectares a year, and in 1992 it totaled 1.143 
million* hectares, exceeding the 1991 area by 17,000* hectares.

  The active protection of forests from fire is conducted on 
an 
area of 770 million* hectares. The biggest fire zones in 1992 
were in the forests of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia)--305,000* 
hectares, and Amur Oblast--135,000* hectares. 
  As a result of fires in past years, large areas of dry trees 
were recorded in Tyumen Oblast (24,500 ha) and Irkutsk Oblast 
(12,000 ha) in 1992. For that same reason, areas of dead trees 
per 1,000 hectares of wooded area were 3.44 hectares in 
Kaliningrad Oblast, 4.15 ha in Leningrad Oblast, and 5.52 ha in 
Vladimir Oblast. 
  The area of forests dying as a result of adverse external 
factors has been increasing in the last three years (353,500* ha 
in 1990, 595,500* ha in 1991, and 543,600* ha in 1992). The 
largest areas of trees killed by industrial emissions are 
located in the environs of the Norilsk Combine, where these 
areas increased by 61,300 hectares in 1992 alone. The 
dessication and degradation of forests on an area of 90,000 
hectares was recorded within the exposure zones of the 
Severonikel and Pechenganikel combines in Murmansk Oblast, and 
all of the trees in the forests covering an area of 15,000 
hectares here are dead. 
  The increasingly severe radioactive pollution of these 
forests is alarming. Zones of pollution by radionuclides were 
recorded in the forests of 15 oblasts, and the Chernobyl 
accident alone was responsible for this kind of damage on an 
area equivalent to 1.3 million hectares. 
  Zones of forest pests and diseases, which also cause the 
dessication and death of trees, covered an area of 2.9 million* 
hectares in 1992. In the West Siberian Economic Region, for 
example, desiccated trees in the zones of forest insect pests 
(the sudden mass proliferation of the Siberian silkworm moth) 
represented 60 percent of the total area of dead forests. 
Measures were taken to combat forest pests and diseases on an 
area of 486,000* hectares in 1992. 
  In the past five years the death of trees and the practice 
of 
clear-cutting have resulted in the loss of 13 million hectares 
of wooded area. Furthermore, reforestation (measured in terms of 
the final stage) has been carried out on an area of only 6.9 
million hectares, or 52.9 percent. In 1992 reforestation 
projects were launched on an area of 1.402 million* hectares, 
and saplings were reclassified as commercial timber on 1.426 
million* hectares. Burned-out forests and dead trees cover a 
total area of 26.5 million hectares in the Russian Federation. 
  The improvement of the state of RF forests will require 
immediate measures to manage forest resources more efficiently, 
protect the forests, and secure their intelligent use. This 
could be promoted by the adoption and implementation of state 
reforestation and fire protection programs and the passage of 
new forest laws. 
  Experts have said that Russia's flora is in a disastrous 
state, but the absence of inventories of plant resources and 
facilities (with the exception of forests) precludes objective 
appraisals of the situation in the country as a whole and in 
different regions. 
<H3>  1.7. Flora and Fauna and Their Present State, Use, and 
Protection </H3>
<H5>  Flora </H5>
  The state of natural plant communities in the arid 
cis-Caspian zone is alarming. The uncontrolled growth of 
anthropogenic influences and the inefficient use of the land, 
without adequate reclamation, have caused the degeneration of 
native plants and the degradation and destruction of the 
vegetative ground cover on large areas. The natural plant 
communities of the steppes and meadows are being diminished, and 
the area of deteriorating tundra communities is increasing. 
  In spite of the somewhat stabilized area of the forests, as 
one type of vegetation, their qualitative indicators have 
declined, and the area covered by dessicated and dead trees has 
increased in some regions. 
  Plant communities are damaged during reclamation projects. 
The broad-scale drainage of wooded areas, for example, has 
impoverished the gene pool of many unique marsh plant 
communities. In particular, whole groves of marshwort were lost 
in Ivanovo Oblast. 
  The unfounded and unofficial procurements of medicinal herbs 
and other useful plants are cause for serious concern, 
particularly the gathering of these plants by cooperatives and 
private entrepreneurs. This has led to the intensive depletion 
of stocks of wild flora and the destruction of plant communities 
that took centuries to become established. In the North Caucasus 
this practice has undermined reserves of ramson (bear's onion), 
in Moscow Oblast the supply of male fern is being depleted, in 
Ivanovo Oblast the stocks of common valerian and bistort have 
been reduced, and in Krasnodar Kray the common St. John's wort 
and yarrow have become rare species. 
  The ground cover is being damaged by the unwarranted 
authorization of gardening and vegetable farming on territories 
with unique plant communities and in forest preserves, 
sanctuaries, and natural monuments. This has occurred in 
Krasnodar Kray, Moscow Oblast, and several other Russian oblasts. 
  The degradation of the plant cover as a whole has been 
accompanied by additions to the list of species in danger of 
extinction, or endangered plants. The RF Red Book now contains 
information on 533 species of flora requiring protection in the 
country: 440 angiospermae (flowering), 11 gymnospermae, 10 
ferns, 4 lycopsids, 22 mushrooms, 29 lichens, and 17 fungi. 
Several species of plants have completely disappeared. In recent 
years, for example, the king fern (Krasnodar Kray), the Volga 
cinquefoil (Central Cis-Volga), the mercury squill (Far East), 
and many others were registered as extinct species. 
  The problem of preserving the specific diversity of flora 
can 
only be solved by securing the proper protection of the habitats 
of species, plant communities, and natural ecosystems. The 
number of species of vascular plants in different 
botanical-geographic regions is illustrated in Figure 1.7.1. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-36A>           Figure 1.7.1. Number of Species of </FIG>



  The stability of terrestrial ecosystems was evaluated within 
the framework of the ``Russia's Ecology'' program, with a view 
to the indicators of supplies of living biological matter and 
dead organic substances, phytoproductivity, specific diversity, 
and the mosaic patterns of the vegetative cover (Figure 1.7.2). 
The use of an integral index of the stability of terrestrial 
ecosystems can secure consideration for the distinctive features 
of the natural component during the planning of regional 
resource use strategy. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-37A>           Figure 1.7.2. Integral Assessment of </FIG>



  The fundamentals of RF legislation on flora must be adopted 
without delay and the planning of a state policy and its 
implementation through the appropriate programs will be required 
for the establishment of the economic and legal basis for the 
intelligent use and protection of plant resources. 
<H5>  Fauna and the State of Habitats </H5>
  The abundance and specific diversity of Russia's fauna 
depend 
directly on the quality of animal habitats. There are three 
separate categories of territories with fairly distinct 
characteristics, depending on the degree of transformation 
resulting from economic activity. 
  The first category is the territory with developed industry 
and agriculture and high population density. The Central and 
Central-Chernozem regions, the cis-Volga, the Volga-Kama zone, 
the North Caucasus, the Urals, and the cis-Ural region belong to 
this category. Here the ratio of forests and open spaces has 
reached the critical level, predetermining considerably 
diminished fauna with a lack of balance in numbers and in specie 
composition. The disruption of the fragile ecological balance in 
these regions could have the most unpredictable results, ranging 
from the loss of certain species to the possibility of a 
dramatic increase in their numbers and outbreaks of various 
epizootic diseases. 
  The second group consists of territories of intensive 
development, industrial construction, the rapid growth of 
extractive branches, and the establishment of a new economic 
structure. The group includes the northern zone of the ETR, the 
new industrial and agricultural zones of Siberia and the Far 
East, and the regions of the West Siberian gas and oil fields, 
where the deterioration of wildlife habitats is still localized. 
This is primarily connected with logging, plowing, hydraulic 
engineering, reclamation, the direct pollution of soil, water, 
and plants with petroleum products, and the agitation and stress 
caused by hunting. 
  The third group consists of territories with a traditional 
economic structure, virtually untouched by change. These are the 
vast expanses in the Siberian north and east, the northeastern 
part of the ETR, and the Far East. The state of fauna here is 
relatively stable because the economy is geared directly to the 
use of animal resources. 
  The main strategic objective in the stabilization of the 
specific composition and numbers of fauna in the next few years 
consists in determining the allowable areas and parameters of 
human activity in protected seats of biodiversity, which include 
wetlands in highly developed regions and regions of average 
development, the floodplains of the same regions and of 
hydraulic engineering construction sites; territories where 
endemic species of animals are concentrated (Maritime Kray, 
Sakhalin Island, and the North Caucasus); sections of the steppe 
in zones of widespread agricultural development. Measures should 
also be taken without delay for government protection and 
monitoring of animals in the logging regions of Siberia and the 
European north and in zones of gas and oil production. 
<H5>  Animal Resources and Their Use and Protection </H5>
  Invertebrates are distinguished by the highest number of 
species (around 80,000) and the lowest level of our knowledge of 
the distribution and numbers of individual species. The most 
vulnerable invertebrates are the fauna groups of the European 
plains and oak woods, some parts of Lake Baykal, the Caspian 
Sea, and other large bodies of water, the groups of Caucasian 
cave-dwellers, and those associated with certain types of flora 
and mountain peaks. Habitat deterioration and excessive fishing 
have reduced the numbers of certain species and have led to the 
imposition of bans on fishing for scallops, crab, sea cucumber, 
trepan, and mussels in some parts of Maritime Kray and the Black 
Sea. Stocks of fresh-water invertebrates--crayfish, pearl 
oysters, river oysters, and medicinal leeches--have been 
diminished perceptibly by the same factors. The RF Red Book now 
lists 34 species of insects and 15 species of mollusks. 
  Among vertebrates, the amphibian class is represented by 
only 
24 species in the Russian Federation, and the Ussuriysk clawed 
newt, the Asia Minor newt, the Caucasian frog, and the rush toad 
are listed in the Russian Red Book. There are no reliable data 
on the numbers of amphibians. Each year up to 500,000 lake frogs 
are caught for export, and 200,000-300,000 grass frogs and 
leopard frogs are trapped for medical and biological 
institutions. 
  Reptiles achieve maximum diversity and numbers in the arid 
and semi-arid oblasts. For example, 21 of the 69 species 
recorded in the Russian Federation live in limited sections of 
the European south of Russia, and there are only 1-7 species in 
the rest of the ETR and in most of Siberia. All species of 
reptiles and amphibians are trapped and kept as pets. The 
underground trade in these species cannot be estimated at this 
time, but their constantly rising prices arouse serious concern 
about the state of their populations. The virtually unrestricted 
operations of the private firms that sprang up in the last few 
years for the production of poisons pose a genuine threat to the 
future of even a species as ubiquitous as the common adder. 
Eleven species of reptiles are listed in the RF Red Book. 
  The distribution of varieties of ornithological species in 
different Russian territories is illustrated in Figure 1.7.3.

  According to the Russian State Committee for Statistics, the 
total bag of waterfowl in Russia is 4-5 million a year, but 
experts believe it is 12-13 million. The situation in the tundra 
and forest-tundra zones has remained satisfactory, except for 
the regions of the Bolshaya Zemlya tundra and the Yamal 
Peninsula, where intensive economic development has reduced the 
numbers of some species. In the forest zone there is a tendency 
toward a decrease in numbers everywhere. Even in East Siberia, 
the situation could be described as pre-depressive. The habitats 
of waterfowl in Maritime Kray have changed dramatically. 
  The great variety of Russia's mammals is illustrated in 
Figure 1.7.4. The variety of ungulates and carnivores is 
illustrated separately in figures 1.7.5 and 1.7.6.

  The development of market relations is directly jeopardizing 
the survival of Russian fauna. The excessive demand for furs, 
reindeer antlers, bear gall, the musk of the musk deer, and 
other products has resulted in a new outbreak of poaching. The 
illegal hunting of wildlife has become a criminally destructive 
practice. 
  Resources of commercial game animals, such as Kamchatka 
beavers, fur seals, and some other types of seals, are being 
depleted, and the numbers of steppe polecat, lynx, glutton, 
yellow-throated marten, Himalayan bear, wood grouse, bustards, 
predatory birds, and waders are dwindling. The European 
population of saiga, the numbers of some strains of mountain 
sheep and goats, Siberian wildcats, Mongolian gazelle, steppe 
falcon, some species of pheasant, and some other species have 
reached the critical point. 
  Commercial fishing for aquatic invertebrates and the 
collection of snake venom and of rare and endangered species of 
birds and insects are virtually unrestricted. 
  To a considerable extent, this has occurred because the 
functions of government administration and control were not 
separated completely from the functions of resource use, and the 
Law of the RSFSR ``On the Protection and Use of Fauna'' and 
earlier RF Government decisions were not brought into conformity 
with the requirements of the Law of the RSFSR ``On the 
Protection of the Natural Environment.'' Hunting and fishing 
inspection agencies were under separate jurisdiction, were not 
supplied with the most essential materials and equipment, and 
became entangled in the fights over the division of authority 
with agencies of the Russian Ministry of Ecology. 
  As a result, in spite of the widespread violations of 
hunting 
regulations, environmental agencies discovered 15,000 fewer 
cases of poaching in 1992 than in the previous year. There are 
no records of the numbers and bag of even the most common 
species of animals, and information received from various 
sources is extremely fragmented and contradictory. The group of 
fees for the use of animal resources has not been finalized yet. 
  Therefore, the standards and structure of government 
management of animal resources do not meet the requirements of 
the developing market economy, and the commercial use of 
biological resources is acquiring chaotic features and has 
escaped government control. 
<H3>  1.8. Fish Resources and Their Present State, Use, 
Protection, and Reproduction </H3>
  Fresh-water basins in the Russian Federation annually yield 
around 200,000* tonnes of fish. More than 60 percent of the 
catch comes from the basins of large rivers, lakes, and 
reservoirs. Under the conditions of market relations in recent 
years, the leasing of commercial ponds and fishing areas, and 
the sale of fishing licenses for game fish, there has been a 
tendency toward smaller catches (Table 1.8.1).

  Fish stocks in the waters of the Ob-Irtysh basin, 
including the Obsk and Tazov coves, are in unsatisfactory 
condition, except for the whitefish. Feeding conditions have 
been affected adversely in the last three years by the drop in 
the water level. The catch of commercial game fish--nelma, 
muksun, and peliad--is decreasing. The catch of whitefish 
depends on fishing conditions and the organization of fisheries. 
The catch in remote regions has decreased dramatically. 
  The Yenisey River, with its low level of 
biological productivity, is marked by the dramatic reduction of 
the supply and catch of the main commercial species--whitefish 
and sig--due to the regulation of runoff from the Krasnoyarsk 
GES. 
  There are strict limits on sturgeon, nelma, salmon trout, 
and 
sig fishing in the Lena River. The catch of sig is 
being reduced by the effects of industrial sewage. The total 
catch can only be increased by the addition of small fish caught 
in fine-mesh nets and crucian carp. 
  In most lakes the catch of commercial species--salmon, 
whitefish, and fish caught in large nets (pike perch, pike, and 
even bream in some cases)--is far in excess of allowable limits, 
whereas reserves of species with less commercial value are 
underutilized. This is causing undesirable changes in the 
composition of ichthyofauna, replacing valuable species with 
roach, perch, and ruff. 
  In Lake Ladoga, which has been affected severely 
by industrial and household sewage, reserves of sig are being 
reduced by the eutrophication of the lake. Stocks of small fish 
are underutilized. The catch of smelt is increasing, but the 
catch of pike perch, bream, and pike is decreasing. 
  In Lake Onega the resource base could yield a 
sizable catch of smelt and whitefish--the main commercial fish. 
The reduction of the catch is due to economic factors. 
  Stocks of whitefish in Lake Pskovsko-Chudskoye can 
be described as small, and reserves of sig are smaller than in 
earlier years. Stocks of pike perch and pike are satisfactory. 
The intense pollution of the lake with petroleum products, 
phenols, and heavy metal salts and the loss of most of the fish 
in winter have affected the natural reproduction of these 
reserves and the size of stocks and catches. 
<H5>  [No 23, 1993 pp 5-12] </H5>
  Lake Ilmen is distinguished by stable reserves of 
bream and satisfactory reserves of pike. The number of pike 
perch has decreased perceptibly, resulting in the institution of 
a fishing limit. More than 50 percent of the catch in the lake 
consists of small fish. 
  A fishing limit on omul, the main commercial fish in Lake 
Baykal, has resulted in the efficient use of omul 
reserves. Reserves of burbot are satisfactory. The catch limit 
on pike, ide, and carp is the result of the poor organization of 
hatcheries and the plundering of these species. 
<H5>  Volga Reservoirs </H5>
  Stocks of pelagian fish are increasing in the 
Rybinskoye Reservoir because of the growth of the 
supply of plankton in connection with the eutrophication of the 
basin. The catch of bottom fish is decreasing, and particularly 
quickly in the case of burbot and pike, as a result of the 
pollution of the reservoir by the Cherepovets Metallurgical 
Combine. 
  Stocks of bream are in a satisfactory state in the 
Kuybyshev Reservoir and constitute 35 percent of the 
total catch here. The reduced catch of pike, catfish, and burbot 
is connected with organizational difficulties. Reserves of small 
fish are being underutilized. 
  Bream reserves are stable in the Saratov 
Reservoir. Stocks of pike perch and pike are small because they 
are highly vulnerable to unfavorable hydrological conditions 
during the spawning season. Sterlet stocks have been stable 
since the fishery opened in 1989. The total yield is close to 
the optimum. Reserves of small fish are being underutilized. 
Herbivorous fish are accounting for an ever greater percentage 
of the catch, and the stocks of these have been estimated at 
1,500-1,700 tonnes. 
  Reserves of the main species in the Volgograd 
Reservoir have been given a satisfactory rating. The reduced 
catch is due to the high water level in recent years. Supplies 
of herbivorous fish and small fish are being underutilized. 
  The Tsimlyansk Reservoir has also acquired 
commercial significance. Reserves of most species have a 
satisfactory rating. Bream is the main fish here, and the total 
catch depends on the state of bream stocks. The catch in recent 
years has amounted to 5,000-6,000 tonnes. It is a limited 
species along with pike perch and blue bream. The carp 
populations are small. 
<H5>  Marine Basins </H5>
  The total catch of fish in the Barents Sea was 
around 600,000 tonnes (including 400,000 tonnes of capelin), as 
compared to 520,000 tonnes in 1991. The cod catch increased from 
114,000 tonnes (1991) to 170,000 (1992) as a result of the 
gradual growth of commercial reserves in the seas of the 
northeast Atlantic. 
  Commercial stocks of haddock (330,000 tonnes) were below the 
average, and stocks of black halibut (around 80,000 tonnes), 
brown snapper (215,000 tonnes), plaice (around 30,000 tonnes), 
and anarhichas species were low. Stocks of capelin decreased 
from 7 million tonnes to 5.5 million. There were also reduced 
stocks of commercial shellfish--scallops and shrimp, although 
the state of shrimp reserves is excellent. 
  Other seas of the Arctic Ocean have no commercial 
significance because they have not been explored sufficiently, 
mainly because of the climate. 
  The numbers of Baltic sprat are still increasing in the 
Baltic Sea. Commercial reserves of this fish in the 
Russian part of the sea reached 725,000 tonnes. Most of the 
herring populations are in excellent condition. Stocks of East 
Baltic cod, however, are in a critical state: Spawning reserves 
have decreased to almost one-seventh of the earlier figure in 
the last 10 years--from 776,000 tonnes in 1983 to 115,000 in 
1992. Stocks of salmon are decreasing. 
  The catch of fish in the Black Sea in 1992 
remained small and amounted to only around 28,000 tonnes, 
including around 12,000 tonnes of anchovy and 13,800 tonnes of 
sprat. Stocks of Black Sea sprat have improved since they began 
decreasing in 1991. The supply in 1992 was 500,000 tonnes. 
Stocks of perch and gray mullet are in a depressed state. 
  Commercial stocks of plaice (1,100 tonnes in 1992) and of 
Azov-Don herring are in a depressed state in the Azov 
Sea. Commercial stocks of sandre amount to 15,000 tonnes, the 
lowest figure of the last decade. Azov anchovy stocks amounted 
to 90,000 tonnes in 1992, and the Russian catch was 2,700 
tonnes. Supplies of sea roach are low. The populations of common 
and starred sturgeon were satisfactory. 
  In the Caspian Sea there was a large catch of 
bream--13,700 tonnes--and Caspian roach--19,900 tonnes. The 
catch of sandre increased in all regions. Stocks of carp and 
catfish were in good condition. The catch of sturgeon in Russia 
amounted to 7,300 tonnes, including 4,240 tonnes of common 
sturgeon, 2,560 tonnes of starred sturgeon, and 460 tonnes of 
beluga. The beluga displayed privation bordering on starvation. 
Commercial stocks of sterlet were estimated at 230,600 fish. 
There was still a tendency toward decrease in the sprat 
catch--168,000 tonnes in 1992 (the lowest of the last 25 years 
because of reduced breeding efforts). 
  The basins of the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of 
Japan, and the Bering Sea and the adjacent 
open expanses of the northwestern Pacific now yield half of the 
Russian catch. 
  In the maritime economic zone of Russia's Far Eastern seas, 
90 percent of the catch consists of mintai, salmon, herring, 
cod, plaice, whitefish, and pollack. Mintai accounts for 71 
percent of the catch, but the stocks of mintai have decreased 
substantially in recent years, particularly in the Bering Sea, 
because of the mismanagement of fisheries. Fishing has been more 
intense in the open expanses of the Sea of Okhotsk, including 
the fishing boats of foreign states. The populations of mintai 
in that sea will be undermined unless mintai fishing in the open 
part of the sea is restricted. 
  Commercial stocks of Far East salmon are average or low, but 
the latest data on the state of certain populations attest to an 
increase in their numbers. 
  The number of Pacific herring is still low, and this will 
require the maintenance of fishing limits. 
  Stocks of cod have increased almost everywhere in the Far 
East in recent years, but the size of the populations near the 
southern Kurils is still on the low 1991 level. 
  An increase in reserves of plaice, primarily yellowfin, has 
been recorded on the West Kamchatka shelf. The rate of sardine 
reproduction in 1992 was much higher than in the previous year. 
A tendency toward the reduction of Iwashi sardine stocks has 
been noted in recent years. The high numbers of pollack fry and 
their excellent rate of survival promise large stocks. 
  Most of the stocks of commercial shellfish are concentrated 
in the seas of the Far East. Stocks of Kamchatka crab, beetle 
crab, blue crab, and spiny crab in 1992 were the same as in 
1991. Tawbatch fishing is still prohibited. Three species of 
squid are of commercial value. Domestic fishermen concentrate on 
the commodore squid, the stocks of which are stable. Reserves of 
Far Eastern brown algae are the largest in Russia, but not all 
of them are in accessible locations, and the algae supply in 
traditional fishing areas has been reduced sharply by 
unrestricted fishing and by game violations. 
  Calculations of the size of populations of sea mammals in 
the 
waters of Russia in 1992 did not reveal any significant changes 
in the state of these resources since the previous year. 
According to International Whaling Commission data, the Pacific 
gray whales of the Chukotka-California population now number 
around 20,100. 
  The fur seal population of the Commodore Islands will 
stabilize at around 225,000-230,000 seals in the next few years. 
The population in the Sea of Okhotsk is in a stable-depressed 
state and numbers around 59,000 fur seals. 
  The total number of seals in the Sea of Okhotsk is around 
1.3 
million (545,000 akiba, 405,000 fascia, 180,000 largo, and 
180,000 lachta). 
<H5>  Reproduction of Fish Resources </H5>
  At this time 114 state fisheries--sturgeon and salmon 
hatcheries, small fish farms, spawning and breeding farms, 
production-acclimatization stations, and others--are engaged in 
the reproduction of fish resources. 
  In 1992 these enterprises put more than 7.15 billion fry in 
natural ponds and reservoirs, including 104.1 million sturgeon, 
637.5 million salmon, 59.4 million sig, and 6.34 billion small 
fish and herbivorous fish. 
  Around 1.026 billion Atlantic salmon fry were released into 
the northern basin for the reproduction of stocks. 
  Most of the sturgeon and small fish fry in the Caspian and 
Azov basins come from hatcheries. Stocks of white and red salmon 
in the Caspian Sea are maintained exclusively by means of 
artificial reproduction. As a result, around 30 percent of the 
fish in the Caspian basin and more than 80 percent of the fish 
in the Azov basin come from fish farms. 
  The artificial reproduction of Pacific salmon was conducted 
at fish farms in Sakhalin, Kamchatka, and Magadan oblasts and 
Maritime and Khabarovsk krays, which produced more than 630 
million fry of humpbacked, calico, silver, and red salmon. 
  The artificial reproduction of fish stocks puts around 
70,000 
tonnes back into circulation each year. 
  The development of the artificial reproduction of fish 
stocks 
is being impeded by the progressive pollution of sources of 
water. This destroys much of the breeding stock in hatcheries, 
and the surviving fry do not always satisfy the necessary 
requirements. 
  In 1992 virtually no measures were taken to improve the 
conditions of the natural reproduction of fish resources. 
Hatchery construction and remodeling projects were suspended. 
<H5>  Effects of Ecological State of Basins on Fish Resources </H5>
  The state of fish reserves depends on the degree of 
anthropogenic influence on the ecosystems of water basins. 
  The White and Barents sea basins: There 
is no commercial fishing in Kola Bay because of severe surface 
and ground water pollution. The whole Kola River, the largest 
salmon spawning bed in Murmansk Oblast, is polluted. 
  Fish stocks in the Pechora River basin are in a depressed 
state as a result of the dumping of industrial sewage, 
stream-driving, and the extraction of sand and gravel. The catch 
of sig and nelma is only one-third or one-fourth of the previous 
level. 
  There have been changes in the ichthyofauna of the Northern 
Dvina River--the percentage of salmon and sig in the catch 
decreased from 29 percent in 1985 to 7.4 percent in 1990. In the 
Onega River the catch of plaice was 27 times larger in the 
1960's than it is now, and the catch of salmon and sig was more 
than 8 times as great in the 1960's. Salmon fishing in the river 
has been prohibited since 1989. 
  The Baltic basin: The pollution of coastal areas 
in Kaliningrad Oblast is localized and is not having a 
perceptible effect on the size of the catch yet. 
  In the eastern part of the Gulf of Riga the content of 
several heavy metals in the fish is approaching the maximum 
allowable concentration and is jeopardizing fishing in these 
regions. 
  Pollution has reduced the effectiveness of salmon and sig 
spawning in Lake Ladoga, and the reproduction of bream has 
deteriorated dramatically in the Petrokrepostnaya inlet. 
  The Azov basin: The regulation of runoff from the 
Don and Kuban rivers by power engineering and irrigation systems 
and the removal of up to 30 percent of the average annual flow 
have caused the severe deterioration of the conditions of 
natural reproduction for the main commercial fish of the Azov 
basin. The spawning beds of semianadromous fish are one-third 
their earlier size, and the spawning beds of anadromous fish are 
almost one-tenth of the earlier size. The length of submerged 
beds has decreased to almost one-fourth of the previous figure. 
Changes in continental runoff have changed the mechanism by 
which the sea is supplied with biogenic elements. 
  The pollution of coastal waters with pesticides has led to 
the accumulation of these substances in the organs and tissues 
of fish (sturgeon, sandre, and carp). 
  The reduction of continental runoff and the increasing 
pollution of the sea have led to the asphyxiation of aquatic 
animals and the death of fish and even of dolphins. 
  The operation of various types of water works is having an 
adverse effect on the state of fish resources in the Azov basin. 
The number of these installations now exceeds 1,500. 
  All of this has reduced the food supply of fish to one-half 
or one-fourth of the previous amount, and reduced the total 
catch to 60,000-120,000 tonnes, including the catch of 
commercial fresh-water fish, which was from 16 to 30 times 
(depending on the species) larger when the continental runoff 
was regulated by natural forces. The beluga and whitefish are 
almost gone. 
  The Black Sea basin: Because of the 
near-disappearance of the Azov anchovy in the Azov Sea as a 
result of the proliferation of Acnidaria, there has been 
virtually no anchovy fishing in the Black Sea for the last three 
years, although the catch here once amounted to more than 60,000 
tonnes. 
  The Caspian basin: The dramatic daily and weekly 
fluctuations in the water level, current, and temperature as a 
result of the winter operations of the Volgograd GES have 
disrupted sturgeon wintering conditions downstream of the GES. 
This has led to the resorption of roe in more than 18 percent of 
the female sturgeon and more than 21 percent of the beluga. 
These sturgeon do not spawn the next season, and this has a 
damaging effect on natural reproduction. 
  The state of fish resources is affected adversely by the 
regular pollution of the water in the Volga basin and by the 
operation of water works with defective devices for the 
protection of fish or without these devices. There are more than 
4,000 registered water intakes of various types in the Caspian 
basin: 1,900 are equipped with special devices for the 
protection of fish, 2,000 have primitive protective devices, and 
100 have no means of protecting fish. 
  The basin of the Far Eastern seas: Industrial 
sewage has polluted 55 percent of the salmon spawning beds in 
the rivers of Sakhalin Oblast. The receding water level of the 
Bolshoy Takoy River as a result of the drainage of bogs upstream 
has reduced the number of fertile autumn Pacific salmon in the 
river to a fraction of what it was. 
  The continued deterioration of ecological conditions in the 
rivers of the Far East could cause irretrievable losses of 
salmon, which, along with the sturgeon, are Russia's national 
treasures. 
<H5>  1.9. Radioactive Pollution </H5>
  The main source of the radioactive pollution of the 
environment in Russia in 1992 was still the soil of the 
territories contaminated by the accidents at the Chernobyl AES 
in 1986 and the Mayak Production Association in 1957. Winds 
lifting the radioactive dust from the soil and atmospheric 
precipitation washing it out of the soil released radionuclides 
into the air, water, and vegetative ground cover. The background 
radiation far away from these regions is the result of the 
pollution of the air everywhere by the products of earlier 
nuclear tests in the atmosphere. The influence of other 
technogenic factors was negligible and strictly localized. 
<H5>  Radioactive Pollution of the Lower Atmosphere </H5>
  The average concentration of total beta-activity in the 
lower 
atmosphere in 1992 in Russia was around 4.6x10-15 
mc/m[.sup]3[/], which was virtually the same as the 1991 
average. 
  Outside the zones contaminated by the Chernobyl and Kyshtym 
disasters the average concentration of such radionuclides as 
cesium-137 and strontium-90 in the air was 0.4x10-15 and 
0.006x10-15 c/m[.sup]3[/] respectively--i.e., virtually the 
same as before the accident at the Chernobyl AES. 
  The average rate of cesium-137 precipitation was 0.05 
c/km[.sup]2[/] a year, which was approximately half the 1991 
figure. The content of strontium-90 in atmospheric precipitation 
was below the level of detectability by methods of analyzing 
this isotope. 
  The average concentration of krypton-85 from the emissions 
of 
enterprises of the nuclear fuel cycle in the lower atmosphere 
was 24x10-12 c/m[.sup]3[/] of dry air in 1992--i.e., the same 
as last year's figure. 
  The average concentration of tritium in atmospheric 
precipitation was 108x10-12 c/l, which was mainly a result of 
global factors. 
  In Kursk the average annual concentration of cesium-137 in 
the air was 0.25x10-15 c/m[.sup]3[/], and the figure in 
Bryansk was 0.17x10-15 c/m[.sup]3[/], which is below the 
cumulative tolerance dose for this isotope by six orders of 
magnitude. 
  The content of radionuclides in atmospheric precipitation in 
the contaminated territories of the ETR is far in excess of the 
national average. Average daily readings of total beta-activity 
and cesium-137 were 0.07 and 0.05 mc/m[.sup]2[/] in 
Novozybkiy and the maximum daily figures were 8 and 17 
mc/m[.sup]2[/] respectively. 
  There were no perceptible changes in levels of radioactive 
pollution on the grounds of nuclear power plants and other 
installations categorized as radiation hazards in 1992. The 
radiometric network of observation posts of Roskomgidromet [RF 
Committee on Hydrometeorology] did not record the presence of 
iodine-131 in the air or in atmospheric precipitation, in spite 
of the radioactive iodine released into the atmosphere at the 
Ignalina AES (22 July 1992) and the Sverdlovsk branch of the 
Scientific Research and Design Institute of Electrothermal 
Equipment. There were no nuclear tests in Russia in 1992. 
  A surface nuclear explosion of around 1 megaton, conducted 
outside Russia on 21 April 1992 on the PRC test site near Lop 
Nor, did not cause any perceptible changes in the global 
radioactive background last year. 
<H5>  Radioactive Pollution of Territories </H5>
  The accumulation of radioisotope precipitate in the soil 
during the year was negligible everywhere in comparison with the 
total supply in the soil and had virtually no effect on the 
pollution levels that had been recorded at the end of 1991. 
  Projects in 1992 corrected some data in the 1991 report and 
expanded the boundaries of the zones of radioactive pollution by 
cesium-137 (Figure 1.9.1). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-47A>           Figure 1.9.1. Density of Cesium-137 </FIG>



  Most of the radionuclides from Chernobyl were cesium-137 and 
strontium-90, and the rate of soil pollution by strontium was 
from one-fortieth to one-one hundredth of the rate for cesium. 
  The radioactive pollution of territories as of January 1993, 
according to Rosgidromet [Russian Federal Service on 
Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control] data, and the 
population of these territories, according to the lists of the 
populated communities within the zones of radioactive pollution,

  Territories with a cesium-137 soil pollution rate of 5-15 
c/m[.sup]2[/] were recorded in Bryansk (2,628 
km[.sup]2[/]), Kaluga (1,419 km[.sup]2[/]), Orel (132 
km[.sup]2[/]), and Tula (1,271 km[.sup]2[/]) oblasts, with 
a rate of 15-40 c/km[.sup]2[/] and over 40 in only Bryansk 
Oblast (2,130 km[.sup]2[/] and 310 km[.sup]2[/] 
respectively). 
  The radioactive pollution of the soil after the disaster at 
the Chernobyl AES at a rate of under 1.0 c/km[.sup]2[/] for 
cesium-137 was recorded in Krasnodar Kray (up to 1.0 
c/km[.sup]2[/]), Rostov Oblast (up to 0.9 c/km[.sup]2[/]), 
Novgorod and Volgograd oblasts and Chuvashia (up to 0.8 
c/km[.sup]2[/]), and in Tatarstan, the Republic of Mari El, 
Udmurtia, Tver Oblast, Perm Oblast, Stavropol Kray, Karelia, 
Kaliningrad Oblast, Kalmykia, Pskov Oblast, the south of the 
Komi Republic, the south of Kirov Oblast, and the Nenets 
Autonomous Okrug at a rate of 0.2-0.5 c/km[.sup]2[/]. The 
lowest levels of radioactive pollution by cesium-137 precipitate 
(commensurate with the global background level) were recorded in 
Arkhangelsk, Astrakhan, Vladimir, Vologda, Ivanovo, Samara, 
Moscow, Murmansk, Orenburg, Kostroma, and Yaroslavl oblasts and 
Bashkortostan. 
  Levels of pollution in agricultural crops began stabilizing 
in 1989-90, and their annual fluctuations are connected 
primarily with climatic factors. When the recommendations are 
followed, all of the farming products in territories with a 
cesium-137 pollution rate of up to 40 c/km[.sup]2[/] are fit 
for consumption in accordance with current standards. On 
agricultural land with a pollution rate of under 10 
c/km[.sup]2[/] there are no problems in the production of 
animal husbandry products meeting standard requirements. The 
planning and use of special methods of animal husbandry are 
essential only in Bryansk Oblast and part of Kaluga Oblast. 
  Radioecological surveys of 3.5 million hectares of 
agricultural land were conducted in 1992. Maps were compiled and 
were distributed to farms along with recommended methods of 
agroindustrial production management. 
  Projects in 12 oblasts improved natural grazing areas on 
47,000 hectares, limed the soil on 144,000 ha, applied 
phosphorite to the soil on 79,600 ha, and applied higher doses 
of mineral fertilizers on 242,300 ha. 
  Around 104,100 specimens of farming products and 234,700 
tonnes of animal husbandry products were inspected. The content 
of strontium-90 and cesium-137 in the grain, potatoes, 
vegetables, and fruit in all of the monitored oblasts did not 
exceed the provisional limits. The proportional quantity of 
polluted milk decreased from 7.9 percent (10,900 tonnes) in 1991 
to 5.7 percent (6,200 tonnes) in 1992, and the respective 
figures for meat were 0.12 percent (40 tonnes) in 1991 and 0.06 
percent (13 tonnes) in 1992. 
  An analysis of the radioactive pollution of forest products 
and by-products revealed that the level of cesium-137 in the 
timber on all monitored plots did not exceed the standard limit, 
but the level in mushrooms, berries, and medicinal resources on 
polluted territories rating higher than 3-5 c/km[.sup]2[/] 
require radiation inspections, and the content in areas with a 
rating of over 10 c/km[.sup]2[/] exceeds the standard limit. 
Around 85-98 percent of the artificial radionuclides are 
concentrated on the forest floor and in the top 10 centimeters 
of soil. During a fire in a forest with a pollution level of 
16-18 c/km[.sup]2[/], the concentration of radionuclides in 
aerosols on the fire's edge increases from 20 to 200 times, but 
it remains below the MAC by one order of magnitude. Winds of up 
to 10 m/sec can cause the secondary pollution of the land 
surface for a distance of up to 1.5 km. The quantity of 
radionuclides carried away by the wind from turf-covered soils 
and forests is negligible--measuring only a few hundredths of 1 
percent a year. 
  The region where the Mayak Production Association is located 
in the south Urals is distinguished by the presence of 
long-lived strontium-90 radionuclides in the composition of 
pollutants and, to a much lesser degree, cesium-137 and 
plutonium-239. 
  The rate of strontium-90 pollution on an area of around 40 
km[.sup]2[/] within the territory of the East Ural 
radioactive track reaches as high as 2,000 c/km[.sup]2[/], 
the maximum level of pollution in the floodplain of the upper 
reaches of the Techa River is 200 mc/km[.sup]2[/] for 
strontium-90 and 400 mc/km[.sup]2[/] for cesium-137. 
Territories polluted by cesium-137, including the floodplain of 
the Techa River above the point where it flows into the Iset 
River, are illustrated in Figure 1.9.2. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-49A>           Figure 1.9.2. Density of Cesium-137 </FIG>



  There is virtually no radioactive pollution of the Tom River 
floodplain outside the safety zone of the Siberian Chemical 
Combine. 
  As a result of the earlier dumping of liquid radioactive 
waste into the Yenisey River by the Krasnoyarsk Mineral Chemical 
Combine, some sections of the floodplain were still polluted in 
1992 at a rate of 20-30 mc/m[.sup]2[/] for hundreds of 
kilometers downstream. 
  Levels of soil pollution by cesium-137 in Orenburg Oblast 
did 
not exceed 0.1 c/km[.sup]2[/] and the rate directly in the 
epicenter of the 1954 nuclear explosion is 1.5 c/km[.sup]2[/]. 
  In Altay Kray, where the first Soviet nuclear test of 29 
August 1949 was responsible for 80 percent of the artificial 
radionuclide precipitate, the average rate of pollution by 
cesium-137 was 0.1-0.2 c/km[.sup]2[/]. There are two spots in 
the southwest of the kray with a rate of 0.2-0.5 
c/km[.sup]2[/]. 
  No pollution of the continental portion of the European 
north 
from the nuclear tests on the Novaya Zemlya test site has been 
detected, but there are localized zones on the island with 
higher levels of radioactivity. The whole site of 90,200 
km[.sup]2[/] requires scrupulous monitoring. 
  Localized pollution has been recorded in some sections of 
the 
Orenburg and Astrakhan gas condensate deposits near the entrance 
to the site of the underground nuclear explosions conducted for 
peaceful purposes in 1965-1987. 
  Between 1974 and 1992, 847 zones of localized and extended 
radioactive pollution were discovered by the Radon Association 
in conjunction with other organizations in Moscow. Approximately 
50 percent were found in the city's southern and eastern 
districts. Most of these were pockets of soil containing 
radon-226 and cesium-137 (612 zones), objects polluted by 
radioactive substances (172 zones), and sources of ionizing 
radiation (63 zones). In 1992 alone, 60 of these zones were 
found within the city limits and 22 were found in the oblast. 
  Readings of constantly monitored radiation parameters in the 
Moscow environment are from one to ten times as high as 
background readings (in the sparsely populated north of Moscow 
Oblast), but they do not exceed public health standards. Zones 
of radioactive pollution which were discovered and then 
neutralized were the only exception. The redistribution of 
radionuclides has been observed: the reduction of radioactive 
aerosol precipitate and of concentrations in the atmosphere and 
the accumulation of radionuclides in the snow cover, bottom 
sediment, and soil. Cesium-137, strontium-90, kalium-40, and 
short-lived products of the decay of radioactive series have 
been detected. 
  The territorial reading of the exposure dose of 
gamma-radiation was higher than background readings in regions 
contaminated by the Chernobyl and Kyshtym accidents and also in 
some locations of mineral extraction and processing and 
localized spots of accidental pollution. 
  In 1992 organizations of Roskomnedra found sites of 
radioactive pollution in 58 cities and industrial centers in the 
Russian Federation. They discovered 517 pockets of radioactive 
pollution, including 129 with a maximum effective dose (MED) of 
gamma-radiation exceeding 1,000 mr/hr. In addition, 401 pockets 
of radioactive pollution connected with the Chernobyl accident 
were found in the city of Penza. 
  Inspections of juvenile academic institutions revealed more 
than 700 objects emitting high levels of radioactivity with an 
MED of up to 0.5 r/hr. 
  According to Mintopenergo [RF Ministry of Fuel and Energy] 
data, the accumulation of significant quantities of natural 
radionuclides (NRN) is possible in the locations of mineral 
extraction and processing, combining with background levels to 
create a hazard. In particular, this applies to coal mines and 
oil drilling sites. The level of gamma-radiation around 106 of 
the 855 inspected wells on oilfields in Stavropol Kray ranged 
from 200 to 1,750 mcr/hr. This was due to deposits of radium and 
thorium salts that were carried to the surface in the excess 
drilling fluid. Polluted production equipment, particularly the 
used pipe in storage, had radiation readings of 3,000 mcr/hr. 
Pipes with a reading of 200-300 mcr/hr were found in use as 
fencing, awnings, and so forth in virtually all of the surveyed 
spots in Neftekumskiy Rayon. 
  In the regions surrounding TES's and GRES's operating on 
coals with high radioactivity levels, ash heaps and the ash 
ejected through smokestacks can cause the accumulation of NRN in 
the soil. When the dust settles for a long time (50-100 years), 
the specific radioactivity of the soil within 50-100 kilometers 
of the TES flues could be two or three times the background 
levels. 
<H5>  Radioactive Pollution of Water Systems </H5>
  The average concentration of radionuclides in the water of 
Russia's rivers in 1992 was the same as in 1991. The 
concentration of strontium-90 was approximately 0.3x10-12 c/l, 
which was below the cumulative tolerance dose by three orders of 
magnitude--400x10-12 c/l for drinking water. The average 
concentration of tritium in the main rivers of Russia was within 
the range of (70-265)x10-12 c/l. 
  The concentrations of cesium-137 and strontium-90 in the 
rivers flowing through Bryansk, Tula, and Kaluga oblasts were 
below the VDU-91 (temporary allowable level) by two orders of 
magnitude (500x10-12 and 100x10-12 c/l respectively). Maximum 
levels of pollution of underground sources of water by 
strontium-90 below the VDU-91 by three orders of magnitude, and 
the maximum level of cesium-137 was one-seventieth of the 
VDU-91. The content of strontium-90 in forest streams in Bryansk 
Oblast can rise as high as 50x10-12 c/l (0.5 times the VDU-91). 
  A strontium-90 discharge of 1.8 times the allowable limit in 
one of the outlets to the Techa River was recorded at the Mayak 
Production Association in 1992 (during the year the 
concentration in the monitored channel was 2-7 times the limit). 
The concentration of strontium-90 in the Techa River was within 
the range of 2.7-5.4x10-10 c/l and exceeded the allowable 
concentration (3x10-10 c/l) for up to 30 kilometers downstream 
from the levee of the last industrial tank. 
  The concentration of strontium-90 in the water of the Iset 
River below the Techa estuary was only one-third or one-fourth 
as high as in the Techa River. 
  The presence of surface reservoirs--storage tanks of liquid 
waste--at the Mayak Production Association causes the migration 
of substances to the water table and underground springs. A 
lenticle of polluted sewage with a capacity of around 4 million 
m[.sup]3[/] and an area of just under 10 km[.sup]2[/] has 
formed under Lake Karachay. The rate of spatial migration by 
polluted underground water can be 80 meters a year. There is the 
danger that this water could penetrate other water-bearing 
structures and enter the surface water. 
  The dumping of sewage containing phosphorus-32 in 1.14 times 
the limit was recorded at the Siberian Chemical Combine (the 
total activity of waste exceeding discharge limits was 157 c). 
Furthermore, the average annual concentration of this 
radionuclide in the monitored channel of the Tom River and the 
closest point of water use was 2.9 times the allowable 
concentration. The concentration of short-lived radioisotopes in 
the Tom River was below the detectable level, and the 
concentration of long-lived radioisotopes was the same as the 
global background. 
  The sewage of the Mineral Chemical Combine (in Krasnoyarsk) 
did not exceed the allowable concentrations in the control 
channel of the Yenisey River in 1992. 
  The average level of strontium-90 pollution in the seas was 
the same as in 1991. The maximum concentration of this 
radioisotope was recorded in the Azov Sea (0.9x10-12 c/l), and 
the minimum was found near the Pacific coastline of Russia 
(0.07-0.17)x10-12 c/l. 
<H5>  Radioactive Waste </H5>
  The management and decontamination of radioactive waste (RW) 
constitute an urgent problem at this time. The main sources of 
this waste are enterprises of nuclear power engineering and the 
defense industry. 
  The disposal of radioactive waste takes precedence over 
other 
ecological problems for the defense complex, because existing 
capacities, the size of storage facilities, and the reliability 
of storage are limited, and the construction of new facilities 
would entail colossal technical and material expenditures. The 
plans for the dismantling of nuclear weapons and nuclear power 
engineering equipment have not been coordinated sufficiently 
with the possibilities for the safe storage and disposal of the 
resulting radioactive waste. 
  Radioactive waste with total activity of 1.7 billion curies 
has accumulated at enterprises of Atomenergo. The waste is kept 
in 227 storage facilities: 81 are closed and 146 are still in 
operation. An experimental industrial unit for the glazing of 
hot waste began operating at the Mayak Production Association in 
1992. More than 110 million curies of radionuclides were encased 
in phosphate glass. 
  Industrial bituminization units were still operating at the 
Leningrad and Kalinin AES's. By the beginning of 1993, more than 
18,000 m[.sup]3[/] of radioactive concentrates had been 
solidified. 
  Due to the absence of the necessary technical equipment for 
the processing of RW in the country in general and the Navy in 
particular, the radioactive waste of nuclear-powered submarines 
and surface ships was dumped in the seas from 1960 to 1992, but 
the volume decreased last year. In 1992, 3066 m[.sup]3[/] of 
liquid RW with activity of 18 c was dumped in the Northern seas, 
and 3,580 m[.sup]3[/] of liquid waste with activity of 10.2 c 
and 2,740 m[.sup]3[/] of solid RW with activity of 37 c were 
dumped in the Far Eastern seas. 
<H5>  1.10. Noise and Electromagnetic Radiation </H5>
  The intolerable level of noise pollution will have a variety 
of adverse effects on public health. 
  The average noise level on highways in big cities like 
Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnoyarsk, Magnitogorsk, and Yekaterinburg 
was 73-83 dB(A), and the maximum level was 90-95. Furthermore, 
the noise level in homes near the highways can be as high as 
62-77 dB(A), which is far in excess of public health 
standards--40dB(A) for daytime and 30dB(A) for 
nighttime--approaching the noise level in production. 
  Changes in the functional state of the auditory analyzer and 
of the nervous and cardiovascular systems have been recorded in 
people living near these highways. Children studying in 
classrooms with a penetrating noise level exceeding 45 dB(A) 
suffer from diminished auditory sensitivity, fatigue, and 
headaches. 
  Physiological studies of hemodynamics in people living near 
the Bykovo (Moscow) and Adler airports indicated that only 62 
percent of the individuals examined had normal blood pressure 
readings for their ages. The complaints of individuals and 
objective data revealed that the subjects of the studies were 
developing functional disorders of the central nervous system, 
the cardiovascular system, and the acoustic organ, taking the 
form of neurasthenia, near-neurotic states, abnormal blood 
pressure readings, stenocardia, and diminished auditory 
sensitivity. 
  Physical examinations of children in the primary grades in 
neighborhoods near the Vnukovo and Astrakhan airports revealed 
the reduction of intellectual capacity by 10-46 percent, an 
increase of 6-13 percent in the rate of respiratory disease, and 
an increase of 26-27 percent in disorders of the nervous system. 
  Mass construction on vacant lots near the runways of 
airports 
in various cities, such as Mineralnyye Vody, Khabarovsk, 
Komsomolsk, Amur, and several others, has reduced or eliminated 
the safety zones around them, and this has increased the zones 
of acoustic discomfort. Noise levels in homes within a radius of 
5-10 km from the outer limits of airports can be as high as 
90-97 dB(A) if the windows are open and 82-99 dB(A) if they are 
closed. 
  The situation is similar with respect to the electromagnetic 
pollution of the environment. According to studies and expert 
appraisals, special radio centers, communication lines, radio 
broadcasting equipment, and radar stations produced this kind of 
pollution in amounts far in excess of public health standards in 
residential communities. 
  High levels of electromagnetic radiation from military 
installations were recorded in several regions (the Republic of 
Mari El and Krasnodar and Stavropol krays). 
  In the rural community of Konosha in Arkhangelsk Oblast, for 
example, located 600 meters from an air defense complex, the 
current density in homes was 17.5 times the maximum allowable 
level (MAL). This contributed to functional disorders of the 
central nervous system and the circulatory system and changes in 
the functional state of the thyroid gland and immune system. 
  According to experts, the deterioration of sanitary and 
hygienic conditions can be expected in the near future, along 
with an increase in the number of people suffering from 
anthropogenic acoustic and electromagnetic disturbances of 
relatively high levels. This is connected with the loss of 
control over the levels of these disturbances, the use of 
sanitary protective zones for construction, the inadequate 
volume of repairs on railroads and at enterprises, the absence 
of strict control over the technical state of motor vehicles, 
the sharp cuts in funding for scientific and 
scientific-technical research projects, and a corresponding 
reduction in the number of researchers, who once conducted 
productive studies of the public health aspects of acoustic and 
electromagnetic influences and who had begun assessing the 
ecological dangers of the effects of these factors on natural 
elements and systems of the environment. 
<H5>  1.11. Environmental Pollution by Highly Hazardous Substances </H5>
  Dioxin, furan: 
  The development of dioxin-hazardous production units in 
several Russian cities and the use of herbicides in the zones of 
intensive rice farming in the Kuban, the lower Volga, the Far 
East, and the cis-Azov zone are creating a genuine threat of 
dioxin pollution. When certain localized sources of dioxin 
hazards were inspected from 1988 to 1992, dioxin pollution was 
found in products, sewage, emissions, the soil, and the air on 
the grounds of several enterprises and in nearby areas. 
  When the content of polychlor dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and 
dibenzofuran (PCDF) in the surface water of Ufa, Chapayevsk, 
Baykalsk, Kondrovo, Kaliningrad, and Dzerzhinsk was measured, 
concentrations exceeding the limit were found near water supply 
networks in Ufa (1.2 times the limit), Chapayevsk (4.1 times), 
and Kondrovo (10.5 times). 
  Dioxins in concentrations exceeding the presumed safe level 
of exposure (PSLE) in the soil on the grounds of plants were 
found in Ufa (up to 160 times the PSLE), Chapayevsk (up to 75 
times), and Dzerzhinsk (up to 1.4 times). In some places in 
Chapayevsk the content of dioxin in the soil exceeded 2,000 
times the PSLE, and the content in the air was almost 7 times 
the PSLE. 
  Benzpyrene: 
  In 1992 the average annual concentrations of BP in most of 
Russia's cities had declined by as much as 70 percent in 
relation to the level at the start of the decade of 
observations, and the average for Russia was 3.3 times the MAC 
in the report year. 
  The only exceptions were Blagoveshchensk, Bratsk, Irkutsk, 
Iskitim, Ulan-Ude, and Chita, where air pollution by BP 
increased (10-20 times the MAC). 
  In some cities the content of BP in the air ranged from 0.1 
to 1.5 times the MAC (Volzhskiy, Voskresensk, Dzerzhinsk, Kursk, 
Norilsk, Orsk, Gorki Leninskiye, Kirishi, Klin, Kovdor, 
Naberezhnyye Chelny, Nakhodka, Severodvinsk, Syzran, Yasnaya 
Polyana). 
<H5>  1.12. Biological Pollution </H5>
  Biological pollution resulting from the accidental 
introduction of animals, plants, and microorganisms into the 
environment can inflict perceptible damage on the vitality of 
existing ecosystems. 
  In recent years the ichthyofauna of the Azov and Black seas 
has suffered from the mnemyopsis leydii brought here 
inadvertently from the United States in ballast fluid. Its mass 
proliferation in the Azov Sea in 1991-92 reduced the quantity of 
plankton to 0.04 mg/m[.sup]3[/], which is below the earlier 
average by a factor of almost 10,000. Changes in the trophic 
structure of pelagian biocenosis have reduced stocks of 
anchovies and sardines dramatically by depriving them of their 
food base. According to FAO estimates, the losses of commercial 
fish in the Azov Sea will be equivalent to 40-60 million U.S. 
dollars a year. 
  The Rapana bezoar in the Black Sea was one of the reasons 
for 
the disappearance of the Gudauta oyster beds. 
  Similar phenomena have been observed in fresh-water basins. 
When sandre and bream settled in the Obskaya inlet, they moved 
to the lower reaches of the Ob River, where they are inflicting 
considerable damage by eating the roe and fry of the river sig. 
  The accidental migration of carp to the small steppe lakes 
of 
West Siberia is reducing the yield of fish from these lakes by 
30-80 percent because the carp are eating most of the minnow roe 
and fry. 
  Insects brought in by accident are frequently agricultural 
pests. They include the American white moth, a pest to mulberry, 
fruit, and decorative trees and shrubs, the potato moth, and the 
Capri beetle--the most dangerous pest to food supplies. 
  The distribution of accidental species of insects in the 
Russian Federation in 1992 was the following: 
  Colorado beetle--on an area of 2.46 million hectares (in 58 
krays, oblasts, and republics); 
  North American white moth--108,000 hectares; 
  Phylloxera--94,000 hectares; 
  San Jose scale--131,000 hectares. 
  Ubiquitous foreign species are taken off the quarantine 
list, 
and after this happens it is no longer possible to isolate and 
evaluate the damage caused by each separate species. 
  Most of the foreign insects that have invaded Russian 
territory are not being monitored. There are no forecasts of the 
probability of new accidental species and the degree of the 
consequent damage. In 1992 the Plant Quarantine Service 
monitored 11 species of insects causing obvious damage in 
extensive areas of the Russian Federation, and 13 species with 
the same status in neighboring countries. Not one of the species 
that entered this country and settled here has been eliminated. 
The areas of proliferation of all of the quarantine species 
without exception are increasing each year. 
  The habitats and numbers of foreign species of arthropods 
are 
growing, and they are causing perceptible harm to human health. 
One species of tick, the Ornithonyssus bacoti, has been found in 
homes in the Donbass in recent years. It is a carrier of 
rickettsialpox. It usually feeds on sinanthropic rodents, but it 
also attacks man, and its bites cause dermatitis. A study of 
cases of dermatitis in Moscow revealed the presence of the tick 
in the capital. Eighty zones of tick-borne dermatitis were 
recorded in Moscow between February 1990 and February 1993 and 
the tick itself was found. 
  Southern species of ants are more common in Russian cities 
now. In addition to the red house ants, which can be found 
anywhere in the capital, Hypoponeva Eduardi Forel from the 
Mediterranean countries and the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus 
and Hasins Alienus Foster, which is most commonly found in the 
South, can now be seen in heated buildings in Moscow. 
  In Moscow the classic beetle roach has been joined by the 
American cockroach (Periplaneta americana L.) and some exotic 
species--the Nanphoeta cinerea Olivier and a resident of warmer 
climes with a resemblance to the red cockroach, Supella 
supellectilinum Serv. The latter's habitat is in the Tropics and 
Subtropics, but it has also been found in Istanbul, Teheran, and 
Paris. 
  The number of Culex piens molertus mosquitoes is still 
rising 
in Moscow. Whereas mosquito abatement projects were conducted on 
an area of 1,400 m[.sup]2[/] in 1972, the figure was 926,000 
m[.sup]2[/] in 1992. 
  The Smirnov beetle (Altagenus smirnovi Zhant) from Kenya has 
settled down in Russia and is damaging woolen, fur, and leather 
goods in homes, warehouses, and fur factories. 
  Because of the danger of the pollution of the environment 
with the waste of enterprises engaged in microbiological 
synthesis, air quality is monitored carefully in the locations 
of enterprises producing protein-vitamin concentrates (BVK)--the 
Kirishi Biochemical Plant, the Blagoveshchensk Biochemical 
Combine, and the Kstovo, Angarsk, and Svetloyarsk BVK plants. No 
BVK particulate was found in 1992 in the industrial zone of 
industrial zone of Kirishi, Kstovo, Angarsk, and Blagoveshchensk 
or in the emissions of the Angarsk BVK plant. Concentrations of 
BVK dust in some samples of the particulate from the Kirishi 
Biochemical Plant did not exceed public health standards. 
Concentrations of BVK dust in the industrial zone of the Svetlyy 
Yar worker's settlement did not exceed the limit. 
  The rate of illness with bronchial asthma, asthmatic 
bronchitis, and skin allergies did not exceed the average. 
<H6>  Section 2. Natural Territories Under Special Protection </H6>
  At a time of economic and political instability, the 
inadequate enforcement of environmental laws, and the dramatic 
deterioration of ecological conditions in many parts of the 
country, protected natural territories (PNT) have a much more 
important role to play in maintaining the ecological balance and 
protecting the natural potential of Russian territories. 
  The main categories (or types) of PNT in the Russian 
Federation are state nature preserves, including biosphere 
preserves, national parks, and federal, republic, and regional 
sanctuaries. 
  The maintenance and development of the PNT network is a 
priority of RF state ecological policy. 
<H3>  2.1. State Nature Preserves, National Parks, State 
Sanctuaries, and Natural Monuments </H3>
  The total area of Russia's nature preserves is 20.4 million* 
hectares, or around 1.2 percent* of the territory of the Russian 
Federation. 
  On 31 December 1992 there were 79* nature preserves in 
Russia: 71* maintained by the Russian Ministry of Ecology, 4* 
maintained by the Russian Academy of Sciences, 2* in the Russian 
Ministry of Science network, 1* belonging to forestry agencies, 
and 1* belonging to the Russian Ministry of Defense. 
  Figure 2.1.1 illustrates the proportional amount of 
protected 
territory in the total area of territorial-administrative units 
of the Russian Federation. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-53A>           Figure 2.1.1. Area of Protected </FIG>



  Three new state nature preserves were established in Russia 
in 1992. 
  ``Pasvik'' was established in Murmansk Oblast (total area of 
14,586 ha) to protect the northern pine forests and valuable 
wetlands and to conduct comprehensive environmental monitoring. 
The preserve is located in direct proximity to Norway, and its 
northern and western boundaries follow the channel of the Paz 
River, marking the state border of the Russian Federation. The 
preserve was founded with the active participation of Norwegian 
specialists and is supposed to become the Russian part of the 
international Russian-Norwegian ``Fjervann-Pasvik'' reservation 
in the future. 
  The ``Dzherginskiy'' preserve was established in the 
Republic 
of Buryatia (total area of 237,806 ha) to preserve and study the 
characteristic and unique ecosystems of the Lake Baykal basin. 
It is located in Buryatia's Kurumkanskiy Rayon in the upper 
reaches of the Barguzin River, including the summit of the Ikat 
range, in locations inhabited by the Evenki people, on whose 
initiative it was established. 
  The ``Kaluzhskiye zaseki'' preserve was established in 
Ulyanovskiy Rayon in Kaluga Oblast (total area of 18,533 ha) to 
protect and study unique sections of forest ecosystems in the 
broad-leaved forests of the ETR. The territory of the preserve 
is part of the oldest protected Russian territory (mentioned in 
chronicles as early as the 9th and 10th centuries), with a large 
impenetrable group of broad-leaved forests. The territory of the 
preserve was exposed to radioactive pollution as a result of the 
accident at the Chernobyl AES and could serve as the site of 
observations of the state of the environment under high levels 
of radiation. 
  Some preserves were enlarged in 1992, adding 3,000* hectares 
to the Central Forest Preserve in Tver Oblast, 17,000* hectares 
to the Caucasus Preserve in the Adyge Republic, 43,000* hectares 
to the Kronotskiy Preserve in Kamchatka Oblast, 111,000* 
hectares to the Barguzin Preserve in the Republic of Buryatia, 
and so forth. 
  Therefore, the area of nature preserves was augmented by a 
total of 496,000* hectares in 1992, including new preserves with 
a combined area of 271,000* hectares and the enlargement of 
existing preserves by 225,000* hectares. 
  Figure 2.1.2 illustrates the locations of the new state 
preserves and national parks established in 1991-92. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-54A>           Figure 2.1.2. Locations of Protected </FIG>



  In 1992 preparations were made for the creation of 11 new 
nature preserves, scheduled for completion in 1993-94. In the 
case of some, surveys were completed, plans were drawn up, and 
the appropriate decisions were made by regional agencies of the 
executive branch of government. These are the ``Ubsunurskaya 
kotlovina'' (or ``Ubsunur'') preserve in the Tuva Republic, the 
``Konovatskiy,'' ``Gydanskiy,'' and ``Yamalskiy'' preserves in 
the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug in Tyumen Oblast, and the 
``Koryakskiy'' preserve in the north of Kamchatka Oblast. 
  The work on the Rostov Steppe Preserve in Rostov Oblast, the 
Suburban Moscow Preserve extending into three rayons of Moscow 
Oblast, and the Commodore Preserve on the archipelago of the 
same name in Kamchatka Oblast reached the final stages. 
  Project plans were drawn up for the Great Arctic Preserve, 
with a total area of around 5 million hectares in the north of 
the Taymyr Autonomous Okrug in Krasnoyarsk Kray and the North 
Astrakhan Preserve in Astrakhan Oblast. 
  Planning and research projects were launched in Leningrad 
Oblast for the establishment of a preserve in the eastern part 
of the Gulf of Finland, which will become part of a large 
international Russian-Finnish reservation. 
  In addition to the creation of new preserves, there were 
plans for the enlargement of existing ones, including the 
enlargement of the ``Basegi,'' ``Central Chernozem,'' and 
``Lazovskiy'' preserves. 
  State preserves have the status of environmental research 
organizations and have been conducting long-term studies for 
more than 60 years as part of the ``Nature Chronicle'' program. 
This research serves as the basis for the organization of 
ecological monitoring and control. Botanical and zoological 
research projects are conducted in the preserves, 
mini-laboratories are set up for the quick analysis of soil, 
water, and air samples, and weather bases and stations are 
operating here. 
  The 16 biosphere preserves occupy a special place among 
Russia's preserves. They are part of the UNESCO global network 
of biosphere preserves. Comprehensive background monitoring 
stations in six of them are recording data on the chemical 
pollution of typical preserve ecosystems. 
  Rare species of animals are kept, studied, and bred in 
nurseries in some preserves for the protection of exceptionally 
valuable genetic stock. Nurseries in the Oka Preserve house 
bison, crane, and birds of prey. The central bison nursery is in 
the Cis-Oka Terrace Preserve. There are animal nurseries in the 
Voronezh, Darwin, and Khingan preserves. 
  The main difficulties in the development of scientific 
research in the preserves stem from the shortage of material and 
technical equipment. The absence of the necessary laboratory 
facilities, equipped with modern computers and measuring 
instruments, is complicating the organization of in-depth 
research. 
  In recent years there have been more frequent cases of the 
use of protected territories for economic activity. Sovkhozes 
located near the Altay Preserve in the Tuva and Gorno-Altay 
republics repeatedly used protected territories as grazing land 
for cattle, sheep, and goats. Furthermore the Altay Republic 
Government has demanded that some parts of the preserve on the 
shore of Lake Teletsk be turned over to the Chulyshmanskiy 
Sovkhoz for use as goat pastures. 
  On 20 May 1992 the Supreme Council of the Kabardino-Balkar 
Republic approved the earlier decision of that republic's 
Cabinet of Ministers on the appropriation of 1,142 hectares of 
land from the Kabardino-Balkar Preserve, including 642 hectares 
of unique alpine forest, which will cause irreparable harm to 
the preserve's ecosystems. 
  In some cases, local governments have considered the closure 
of preserves for immediate economic interests. The Ayano-Mayskiy 
rayon council, for example, is demanding the closure of the 
Dzhugdzhurskiy Preserve in Khabarovsk Kray, and officials on 
Kunashir Island (Southern Kurils) have questioned the 
advisability of the continued functioning of the ``Kurilskiy'' 
preserve. 
  The protection of state preserves is the responsibility of a 
special board of inspectors with a staff of around 1,600. 
  In 1992 the inspectors wrote up 2,125 reports, including 629 
on the unauthorized occupation of land, 531 on the poaching of 
fish and other aquatic flora and fauna, 436 on traffic 
violations, 221 on illegal hunting, 100 on illegal hay-mowing 
and livestock pasturing, 96 on unauthorized felling, 37 on 
violations of fire safety regulations in forests, and so forth, 
and apprehended 1,134 offenders. They investigated the illegal 
shooting (or trapping) of 47 ungulates, 3 bears, 2 tigers, and 
so forth. 
  They confiscated 17 rifles, 66 shotguns, 306 nets, 810 
traps, 
993 kilograms of fish, and 500 kilograms of wild plants. Law 
enforcement agencies instituted criminal proceedings in 35 of 
these cases. 
  The treatment of the preserves by state planning and finance 
agencies is clearly inconsistent with their socioeconomic and 
scientific significance. 
  The Ministry of Finance allocations for the maintenance of 
preserves were woefully inadequate. In 1992, for example, the 
amount required for the maintenance of the preserves was 770 
million rubles, but allocations were limited to 394.8 million 
rubles. This was enough only for the bare minimum of basic 
functions. The preserves needed 272 million rubles in capital 
investments for the development of their material and technical 
base, but the amount extended was only 121.3 million. 
  All of the work involved in the establishment of new 
protected natural territories is financed by federal and 
regional extrabudgetary ecological funds. New preserves suffer 
difficulties because the meager allocations preclude the 
construction or leasing of housing for their personnel, 
buildings for offices, public facilities, and laboratories and 
the purchase of expensive equipment, supplies, weapons, 
ammunition, etc. 
  Payment for airborne forest protection services was late and 
extremely limited in 1992, as a result of which the network of 
preserves was not ready for the fire season. Fires which were 
not detected in time caused serious damage. The continuation of 
this kind of funding in coming years could destroy the network 
of Russian preserves, and this will have an irreparable negative 
impact on environmental quality. 
<H5>  National Parks </H5>
  The national parks are a type of territorial nature preserve 
that did not exist in Russia in the past. They are intended for 
use for conservation, recreational, educational, scientific, and 
cultural purposes and generally include unique natural objects, 
landscapes, historical monuments, and other natural wonders. 
Most of the area of these parks is taken up by forests and 
bodies of water, but the preservation of the integrity of the 
natural complex has sometimes required the inclusion of other 
territories in the parks, as well as historical-cultural, 
memorial, and botanical territories, including natural museums. 
  The first national parks in Russia were established in 1983 
(the ``Sochinskiy'' on the Black Sea coast and the ``Losinyy 
ostrov'' park in the city and oblast of Moscow). By the end of 
1992 Russia already had 22 national parks with a total area of 
more than 4.4 million hectares. Five parks (with an area of 
546,800 hectares) were established in 1992. 
  All of the national parks but two (``Losinyy ostrov'' and 
``Pereslavskiy'') are managed by the Federal Forest Service. 
  A standard statute on Russia's national parks, defining the 
procedures for their organization and the rules of their 
management and operation, was drafted in 1992. 
  The main economic instrument for the management of national 
parks is direct budget financing. Allocations for the 
maintenance of these establishments in 1992 were projected at 
15.5 million rubles in 1992--i.e., an average of 4 rubles per 
hectare of protected territory--and the amount paid in 1992 was 
142 million, or 35 rubles per hectare, but in the new prices. 
National parks can strengthen their financial position, however, 
by offering the use of their territory for recreational 
purposes. The main prerequisite is the existence of a developed 
infrastructure in the parks, connected with specific forms of 
public services requiring large initial investments, including 
investments financed by budget allocations. 
  The creation of national parks entails the appropriation of 
land, forest, and water resources and the cessation of 
untraditional forms of resource use within their territory, 
which is frequently resisted fiercely by economic structures. 
  Regrettably, in the last 10 years, from the time the system 
of national parks began to be organized to the present, the 
processes of establishment have not been completed in a single 
park. The biggest problems are connected with land requisitions. 
It can take years to draw up the general plans, coordinate them, 
and put together a staff of specialists. Budget funding and 
material and technical supplies are clearly inadequate. 
Financing operations and the hiring of personnel for the main 
areas of functional activity are conducted without any clear 
priorities. 
  National parks often fall victim to illegal economic 
expansion, primarily by local government agencies. 
  The lack of legal protection for the national parks is the 
reason for the continuation of practices injuring their natural 
complexes: the extraction of building materials (``Samarskaya 
luka''), the detachment of parcels of land (the 
``Pribaykalskiy'' and ``Losinyy ostrov'' parks), the grazing of 
livestock and application of herbicides (``Bashkiria''), and the 
use of the land for orchards, gardens, and garages 
(``Sochinskiy,'' ``Losinyy ostrov,'' and others). 
  A comprehensive performance evaluation of the ``Losinyy 
ostrov'' park by the Russian Ministry of Ecology in 1992, for 
example, revealed that environmental laws and the forest and 
land codes were virtually unenforced in the park. There were 
numerous cases of the failure to take action against individuals 
using park lands and protected zones for vacation homes, 
gardens, garages, and timber felling. Most of the enterprises on 
the grounds of the park and its protected zone are not equipped 
with effective waste treatment plants. The state of affairs in 
the park, its organizational structure, its administrative and 
economic dependence on the Moscow Municipal Forest Park 
Administration, and its maintenance by the Moscow Municipal 
Planning and Engineering Administration are inconsistent with 
its significance, its status, and the purpose and goals of its 
creation. In general, the commission found that the park's 
performance had been unsatisfactory since the time of its 
establishment. The park still does not have a definite 
development strategy, an approved general plan, or even a 
document certifying its right to use the land, legal 
certification of the boundaries of its protected zone, and many 
other legislative instruments regulating the relations between 
the park administration and the many individuals make use of its 
territory. All of this is against the interests of the park 
because it limits its development to the confines of ordinary 
forest parks. 
  Difficulties similar to those suffered by ``Losinyy ostrov'' 
were also encountered in the creation of the ``Samarskaya luka'' 
national park, the establishment of which began in 1984 and has 
not been completed yet. Part of the park's territory was 
appropriated for the extraction of clay and local building 
materials with the support of the Samara Oblast corps of 
deputies. The minor soviet of the Irkutsk Oblast Soviet of 
People's Deputies arranged for the revision of the boundaries of 
the ``Pribaykalskiy'' National Park, despite the fact that this 
park is under exclusive federal jurisdiction. 
<H5>  State Wildlife Sanctuaries </H5>
  Sanctuaries are natural complexes of conservation, 
ecological, and aesthetic value and are intended for the 
preservation, reproduction, and restoration of specific types of 
natural resources (or objects) in combination with the limited, 
controlled, and efficient use of others. The rules of 
sanctuaries are stipulated in individual statutes by agreement 
with the users of the land. A standard statute on state wildlife 
sanctuaries in the Russian Federation was approved in 1992. 
  Russia has more than 1,500 sanctuaries, including 71 federal 
sanctuaries on an area of over 56 million hectares, representing 
more than 3 percent of the country's territory. Around 200 are 
landscape sanctuaries. 
  Most of the sanctuaries are in the Main Hunting 
Administration network-- around 1,000 sanctuaries with an area 
of 49.7 million hectares. Their security service is extremely 
limited--an average of one or two rangers per sanctuary. 
  Supplementing the network of preserves and national parks, 
and adjacent to them in many cases, the sanctuaries do much to 
increase their legal representation. Seven sanctuaries 
(``Verkhne-Kondinskiy,'' ``Yeloguyskiy,'' ``Kabanskiy,'' 
``Tsasucheyskiy bor,'' ``Yuzhno-Kamchatskiy,'' ``Yuzhnyye 
Kurily,'' and ``Tseyskiy'') are on the grounds of nature 
preserves and are under the jurisdiction of the Russian Ministry 
of Ecology. Others will be added to this list in the future. The 
``Nature Chronicle'' is kept each year in the republic 
sanctuaries, just as it is in the preserves. 
Scientific-procedural backing for the activities of sanctuaries 
was provided by the Central Scientific Research Laboratory of 
the Russian Federation Main Hunting Administration and the 
Russian Ministry of Ecology. 
  In contrast to other protected natural territories, the 
network of state sanctuaries is an extremely dynamic and mobile 
form of protection. The many years of experience in working with 
the sanctuaries have revealed that their potential to protect 
wildlife is far from exhausted. There is the real possibility of 
enhancing the effectiveness of these protective entities 
considerably by supplementing RF legislation with several 
sections on liability for violations of the rules of sanctuaries 
and by instituting supplementary state statistical reports. 
<H5>  Natural Monuments </H5>
  Unique natural objects requiring special state protection 
and 
having features of scientific, historical, and 
ecological-educational value can be declared federal or local 
natural monuments and be withdrawn completely from economic use. 
  According to the latest inventory of state forest resources, 
0.0003 percent of Russia's territory is categorized as natural 
monuments, which is 97,300 hectares more than in 1983. 
  Natural monuments are not independent juridical persons. The 
enforcement of the rules of their protection and use is the 
responsibility of the institutions owning the land where they 
are located. The observance of these rules is overseen by state 
environmental agencies. 
  Forest preserves, natural monuments, and forests of 
scientific or historical significance are usually examples of 
typical landscapes and the habitat of rare and valuable plants 
and often perform the functions of local micro-preserves or even 
republic preserves in some cases. 
  Natural monuments are more vulnerable to anthropogenic 
influences because of their smaller area in comparison with 
other protected territories and because of their lack of 
protective buffer zones. Violations of the rules of natural 
monuments have been recorded everywhere: poaching, illegal 
felling, and unsupervised forms of recreation. As a result, up 
to 25 percent of the area of natural monuments is experiencing 
excessive anthropogenic influences that are degrading natural 
complexes and objects. 
  A standard statute on natural monuments in the Russian 
Federation was approved in 1992 for the purpose of improving the 
legal bases of their operation. 
<H5>  Natural Museums </H5>
  Natural museums, which include memorial-historical and 
literary museums, historical dwellings, open-air museums, and 
others, occupy a special position among the protected natural 
territories. 
  The area of the natural museums ranges from a few hectares 
(the Borodino State Natural Museum of Military History--11 
hectares) to tens of thousands of hectares (the Sholokhov 
Natural Museum in Rostov Oblast--28,000 hectares). Not all of 
them have official protective zones. 
  Up to the present time there have been no statutes 
regulating 
their functions, organizational principles, and rules of land 
use and ownership. There are no ecologists on the staffs of 
these organizations, and there is no system of monitoring and 
preventive maintenance. All of this leads to critical ecological 
situations on the grounds of the natural museums. A good example 
is the Yasnaya Polyana museum-preserve, where the old park has 
suffered considerable damage from the harmful emissions of the 
nearby Azot Production Association in Shchekino. The Shchelykovo 
Natural Museum in Kostroma Oblast and others are encountering 
similar problems. 
  Although the ecological conditions of the Borodino State 
Natural Museum of Military History are good in general, the 
misuse of the land has disrupted hydrological processes and 
caused irreversible changes in the appearance of the historical 
landscape. Its preservation will require a standard program of 
land use on this territory, which now belongs to eight different 
organizations. 
  The protected natural territories have certain problems in 
common: the weak legal and procedural base, unsatisfactory 
methods of keeping records and evaluating the state of existing 
objects, and the absence of a comprehensive research program. 
<H5>  2.2. Health Resorts and Therapeutic Treatment Zones </H5>
  The territorial distribution of the country's resort and 
therapeutic treatment zones is not uniform (Table 2.2.1). 


Table 2.2.1. Health Resorts and Therapeutic Treatment Zones 

Economic region                  Number of resorts      Type of therapy

  The North Caucasus and Kalmykia will be of special 
importance 
in the further development of therapeutic resources, although 
the favorable landscape and climate in many parts of the country 
and the presence of known and projected reserves of mineral 
springs and therapeutic muds could turn local spas into resort 
complexes. The current demand for resort therapy is satisfied by 
no more than 10 percent for adults and 6 percent for children. 
  Health resorts and vacation establishments belong to 
different ministries and departments, including the RF 
Federation of Independent Trade Unions, which has been 
monitoring the state of the environment and natural resources of 
resort zones for many years. 
  In 1992 trade unions owned 455 health resorts with 
accommodations for 213,100 guests. They served 2.6 million 
people (4.2 million in 1991). There were 165 mineral springs and 
55 sources of therapeutic mud on the grounds of the resorts. 
There were 712 operating wells, yielding a total of 116 
m[.sup]3[/] a day (based on known reserves and water intake 
data). 
  The reduction of the number of clients (because of the high 
cost of travel and other factors) reduced the amount of mineral 
water and therapeutic mud used in large resort regions. 
  Changes in the number of vacationers, mineral water 
consumption, and the use of therapeutic mud at Kavminvod 
[Caucasian Mineral Springs] resorts are illustrated in Figure 
2.2.1. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-59A>           Figure 2.2.1. Vacation Dynamics of </FIG>



  The Russian Government has approved 96 quarantine districts 
on the grounds of the resorts of trade unions, the approval of 
40 more is pending, and another 15 should be approved before 
1995. Around 140 technological plans for the efficient use of 
mineral springs and sources of therapeutic mud have been drawn 
up. 
  The number of substandard water samples, displaying high 
levels of bacteriological pollution, at Kavminvod resorts in 
1992 was slightly lower than in 1991: water from the Narzan 
Mineral Springs in Kislovodsk (71 percent in 1992 and 81 percent 
in 1991) and Radon Springs in Pyatigorsk (45 percent in 1992 as 
compared to 50 percent in 1991). This was probably due to the 
general reduction of water use. 
  The absence of fundamentals of RF legislation on health 
resorts has precluded the necessary work to stop processes of 
degradation in territories of unique value to life and health. 
This is particularly true of the ``resort towns'' that sprang up 
when sanatorium and therapeutic treatment complexes were 
enlarged and transformed natural zones into urbanized 
landscapes, with all of the ensuing consequences. 
<H5>  2.3. Ethnic Territories </H5>
  According to the RAN Institute of Ethnology and 
Anthropology, 
there are 62 small indigenous nationalities in the Russian 
Federation, numbering 440,000 people in all and representing 0.3 
percent of the national population. 
  The presence of rich mineral deposits and unique biological 
resources led to two basic methods of economic activity and 
resource use in locations inhabited by the small national 
groups. The first--the traditional method of the indigenous 
people and a product of historical development--is based 
primarily on the use of renewable natural resources. The 
second--the industrial method--is connected with the industrial 
development of the territories inhabited by these small national 
groups, often with no consideration for the specific 
environmental requirements and existing lifestyle of the 
indigenous population. This has a negative effect on the 
ecological situation and the living conditions of local 
residents, especially in regions of the North, Siberia, and the 
Far East. 
  The mismanagement of natural resources in these regions 
causes irreversible changes in the natural landscape and the 
disfigurement and destruction of tens of thousands of hectares 
of reindeer pastures, forests, and hunting grounds each year, 
which, in turn, undermines the economic foundation of the 
survival of the small groups and produces other negative 
socioeconomic results. 
  In accordance with Edict No 397 of the president of the 
Russian Federation of 22 April 1992 ``On Immediate Measures To 
Protect the Native Regions and Economic Activities of Small 
Ethnic Communities in the North,'' agencies of the executive 
branch of the federal government are defining territories of 
traditional resource use that may not be appropriated for 
industrial or other purposes without the consent of the small 
ethnic communities of the North. 
  This work, however, has been seriously impeded by the 
absence 
of the necessary legislative base defining the legal status of 
the small indigenous groups and the territories of traditional 
resource use and ethnic-ecological regions. 
  This will require the passage of special legal instruments 
(RF legislation on the legal status of small nationalities, an 
RF law on territories of traditional resource use by small 
national groups, and others) for the creation of favorable 
conditions for the revitalization of the small ethnic 
communities and the improvement of their native regions. 
  Improvements in existing legislation, combined with 
organizational, economic, and educational measures, will promote 
ecologically sound methods of resource use in locations 
inhabited by the small national groups, as well as the 
preservation of their traditional lifestyle and their stable 
development on the basis of the appropriate legal foundation in 
a market economy. 
<H6>  Section 3. Environmental Effects of Economic Complexes </H6>
<H5>  3.1. Fuel and Energy Complex </H5>
  The fuel and energy complex (TEK), which is made up of 
enterprises of the coal, gas, oil, and petroleum refining 
industries and of power engineering enterprises, has a 
significant impact on the environment. The TEK is responsible 
for 48 percent of the pollutants released into the atmosphere 
from stationary sources and over 15 percent of the discharges of 
polluted sewage. 
<H5>  Coal Industry </H5>
  The main coal basins in the Russian Federation are the 
Kuznetsk, Pechora, Kansk-Achinsk, South Yakut, and Donetsk 
(Rostov Oblast) basins. 
  In 1992 the output of coal was 5 percent* smaller than in 
1991 and totaled 337 million* tonnes. 
  In spite of production cuts, emissions of harmful substances 
amounted to 394,000* tonnes, an increase of 7.6 percent* over 
the 1991 figure. The increase was connected with the failure to 
carry out scheduled projects to equip sources of emissions with 
waste treatment equipment (not one air filter or gas trap was 
installed in 1991), to begin using gas boilers, and to eliminate 
small boiler houses. 
  The coal industry is responsible for only around 1 percent 
of 
all emissions in the country, but the emissions of 
machine-building plants for the coal industry contain such 
hazardous substances as vanadic pentoxide, hexavalent chromium, 
and hydrogen chloride and fluoride. 
  There were no appreciable changes in the use of water 
resources and the dumping of sewage. Enterprises of the branch 
dumped 596 million* m[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage, 
representing 84 percent* of all the waste water requiring 
treatment, (mainly drilling fluid dumped without any treatment) 
into surface bodies of water. 
  The amount of treated sewage meeting standard requirements 
in 
1992 was 112 million* m[.sup]3[/], but the amount in 1991 had 
been 135 million*. Around 90 enterprises in the branch have no 
sewage treatment facilities. Discharges of certain substances in 
excess of standard limits ranged from 43 to 88 percent* in 
several production associations. 
  Enterprises in Perm, Kemerovo, Rostov, and Sakhalin oblasts 
dumped the largest quantities of polluted sewage, and this had a 
highly negative impact on the hydrochemical state of bodies of 
water. After the drilling fluid of the Kizelovsk coal basin was 
dumped in the Kosva and Gubakha (Perm Oblast) rivers, the grade 
III quality rating (``moderately polluted'') of the water was 
replaced with a grade VII rating (``extremely contaminated''). 
  Conservation projects are being carried out too slowly, and 
some projects have either been suspended or have not begun yet. 
The construction of waste treatment facilities in the mines of 
the Kizelovsk and Podmoskovye basins and the Almaznaya and 
Gukovskaya mines in Rostov Oblast, for example, is taking too 
long. In 1992 the new waste treatment equipment in enterprises 
of the branch could handle only 2,760* m[.sup]3[/] a day. 
  The enterprises of the branch have destroyed more than 
135,000* hectares of land, and only 2 percent* of this land has 
been reclaimed. The area reclaimed in 1992 was 2,600* hectares, 
which was 12 percent* smaller than the 1991 area. The reduction 
of annual reclamation area is seen mainly in the Kuzbass and the 
regions around the deposits of East Siberia and the Far East. 
The main reason is the shortage of funding and special equipment 
for this work. 
  The amount spent on environmental projects in 1992 was only 
5.9 billion* rubles, including 731 million* in capital 
investments. 
<H5>  Gas Industry </H5>
  The largest gas deposits in the Russian Federation are the 
Urengoy, Medvezhye, Gubkinskoye, Transpolar, Komsomolsk, 
Yamburg, and Yamsovey deposits in West Siberia; the Vuktyl 
deposit in Komi; the Volga-Ural oil and gas complex in Tataria 
and Bashkiria; and the Astrakhan and Orenburg gas condensate 
deposits. 
  There was only a slight reduction in the gas output in 1992 
(640 billion m[.sup]3[/] as compared to 643 billion in 1991). 
  The steady reduction of gross emissions of harmful 
substances 
has been recorded throughout the branch--from 2.526 million 
tonnes in 1991 to 2.138 million in 1992. Enterprises of the gas 
industry are responsible for around 20 percent of all harmful 
emissions (hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, 
methyl mercaptan, and others) from stationary sources in the 
Russian Federation. 
  Only 8 percent* of all waste gases are trapped and 
neutralized, and this is the lowest indicator in all branches of 
industry. In connection with this, many of the communities 
located near gas extraction and processing sites are on the list 
of cities with the highest levels of air pollution (the cities 
and settlements of Astrakhan Oblast). 
  Enterprises of the branch dumped 21.3 million* m[.sup]3[/] 
of polluted sewage into surface bodies of water and used 56 
million* m[.sup]3[/] in 1992. 
  The amount of reclaimed land was 2,800* hectares. 
  The branch spent 5.3 billion rubles on environmental 
protection in the report year, including 3 billion in capital 
investments. 
<H5>  Oil Industry </H5>
  The largest sources of oil in the Russian Federation are the 
deposits in the West Siberian and East Ural basins. 
  The output of oil, including gas condensate, and of 
casing-head gas in 1992 was 400 million tonnes (87 percent of 
the 1991 figure) and 32 billion m[.sup]3[/] (91.4 percent of 
the 1991 figure) respectively. The quantity of recycled 
casing-head gas did not exceed 79.6 percent, and 8.2 million 
m[.sup]3[/] (82 percent of the 1991 figure) burned in the 
oilfields, mainly at West Siberian enterprises. 
  Enterprises of the branch are responsible for 10 percent of 
the gross emissions of pollutants in the Russian Federation. The 
most common pollutants are nitrogen and hydrogen oxides, 
hydrogen sulfide, and hydrocarbons. Total harmful emissions 
decreased by 10 percent* and amounted to 2.5 million* tonnes, 
but there was a slight increase in emissions of solid particle 
and carbon monoxide. 
  The amount of water used in oil recovery in 1992 was 1.174 
billion* m[.sup]3[/], or 9 percent* less than before, and 
recycled water use decreased by 9 percent* and amounted to 1.631 
billion* m[.sup]3[/]. The quantity of polluted sewage 
decreased by 11 percent* and amounted to 21 million* 
m[.sup]3[/]. 
  The area of land included among branch assets decreased by 
13 
percent (in comparison with 1991 figures) and amounted to 
387,000* hectares in 1992. In the past year 12,700* hectares 
were damaged and 9,700* were reclaimed. 
  The number of accidents on pipelines in 1992 was slightly 
lower than in 1991. 
  Environmental expenditures in 1992 totaled 9.7 billion* 
rubles. 
<H5>  Petroleum Refining Industry </H5>
  Petroleum refineries discharged more than 1.5 million* 
tonnes 
of pollutants into the air in 1992, which was 54,000* tonnes 
less than in 1991. Emissions per tonne of refined oil amounted 
to 3.83 kilograms, which is considerably higher than foreign 
indicators. 
  Technological losses amount to around 2 percent of the 290 
million tonnes of oil and gas condensate refined each year, and 
the rate of irretrievable losses is 1 percent and exceeds the 
official limit. The reason is that only 437 of the 15,000 
refinery tanks are equipped with pontoons and only 81 have 
adjustable covers. 
  The improvement of gas-jet equipment considerably reduced 
hydrocarbon emissions at the Moscow refinery and one of the 
refineries in Ufa. 
  There was no major renovation of existing plants 
(refineries) 
in the last few years, and this has had negative effects on 
ecological conditions in Ufa, Angarsk, Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Novokuybyshevsk, Salavat, and other cities where refineries are 
located. 
  The industry used more than 290 million* m[.sup]3[/] of 
fresh water for production needs in 1992. Proportional 
expenditures of water per tonne of refined oil ranged from 0.025 
to 2.2 tonnes, averaging 0.68 tonnes. 
  On the average, 94.9 percent of the water is recycled. 
Almost 
50 percent of all existing water-cooling towers require major 
repairs. 
  Although all of the enterprises of the branch are equipped 
with waste treatment facilities, only 20 have flotation cleaning 
units, 23 have biological decontamination systems, and 10 have 
complete decontamination facilities. 
  In 1992 the amount spent on environmental protection in the 
petroleum refining industry was 3.6 billion* rubles, including 
1.06 billion* in capital investments. 
  Petroleum product supply networks are an additional source 
of 
environmental pollution. They include more than 20,000 
kilometers of main pipelines with hook-ups to 265 consumers and 
a network of 7,600 gas stations, including around 7,000 serving 
the public. In 1992 the national economy was supplied with 142 
million tonnes of the main petroleum products. The total reserve 
capacity of oil installations exceeds 23 million m[.sup]3[/]. 
  Emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere in 1992 
amounted to 79,000 tonnes, including 66,000 tonnes of 
hydrocarbons, or slightly less than in 1992 [sic]. 
  The respective water consumption figures for operational and 
production needs were 7.5 million m[.sup]3[/] and 11 million 
m[.sup]3[/]. The recycled quantity is 9 million 
m[.sup]3[/] a year (40 percent). Sewage discharges have 
stabilized in recent years and amount to 16.5 million 
m[.sup]3[/] a year, with around 3 million m[.sup]3[/] 
dumped untreated. 
  Environmental protection measures in the petroleum products 
supply system cost 81.6 million* rubles in capital investments 
in 1992. 
<H5>  Power Engineering </H5>
  In 1992 the TES's of the Russian Mintopenergo [Ministry of 
Fuel and Energy] generated 662 billion kilowatt-hours of 
electrical power and 790 million Gcal of heat. This required 323 
million tonnes of standard fuel units (TUT)--25 percent coal, 12 
percent fuel oil, and 62 percent natural gas. 
  The TES's are responsible for over 20 percent of all 
emissions from stationary sources in the Russian Federation. The 
most common pollutants are sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, carbon 
monoxide, solid matter, ash, and the most dangerous 
substances--vanadic pentoxide and benzpyrene. Total emissions 
were slightly below 1991 levels, mainly because of the reduced 
output of electrical power for industry and the use of more 
effective dust catchers. Nevertheless, the emissions of only 
half of the TES's stay within permissible limits. 
  Atmospheric emissions included 2 million* tonnes of light 
ash, 2.7 million* tonnes of sulfur dioxide, and 1.4 million* 
tonnes of nitrogen oxides. Emissions of light ash were 1.3 
million* tonnes below the 1985 figure, and sulfur dioxide 
emissions were 1.85 million* tonnes below the 1985 figure, while 
emissions of nitrogen oxides remained at the previous level. 
Pollutants released per tonne of TUT amounted to 19.3 kg, a 
decrease of 10 kg since 1985. 
  Emissions of sulfur dioxide in the ETR were reduced by 64.2 
percent of the 1980 figure and emissions of nitrogen oxides were 
reduced by 8.5 percent of the 1987 figure in accordance with 
commitments stemming from the Convention on Trans-Border Air 
Pollution. 
  The amount of water used in the generation of electricity 
and 
heat in 1992 was 25.5 billion* m[.sup]3[/]. The amount of 
water recycled was 59.3 billion* m[.sup]3[/]. Total water 
consumption was 1.8 billion m[.sup]3[/] below the 1985 
figure, and recycled water increased by 8.5 billion 
m[.sup]3[/]. Releases of polluted sewage amounted to 1.4 
billion* m[.sup]3[/] and were 43 million* m[.sup]3[/] 
below the 1991 figure. 
  The total area of destroyed lands on 1 January 1993 was 
17,700* hectares. The area reclaimed in the past year covered 
1,410* hectares, 471,000* m[.sup]3[/] of topsoil was removed, 
and 684,000* m[.sup]3[/] of previously stored topsoil was 
used, leaving 3.275 million* m[.sup]3[/] in storage. 
  A total of 10.3 billion* rubles, including 3.2 billion* in 
capital investments, was used for the protection and intelligent 
use of natural resources during the generation of electrical 
power and heat. 
  Hydroelectric power stations (GES's) generated 173 million 
kilowatt-hours of electricity in 1992. The construction of GES's 
and creation of reservoirs flooded 4.5 million hectares of land, 
including 1.6 million hectares of agricultural land and 2.1 
million hectares of forest and scrub. A million hectares were 
protected from submersion by a lower high-water mark. The 
irrigation zone of the water resources in reservoirs was 
equivalent to 5.5 million hectares. 
<H5>  Nuclear Power Engineering </H5>
  Enterprises of the RF Ministry of Atomic Energy can have a 
colossal impact on the environment. 
  The source of the potential danger is the entire process of 
the nuclear fuel cycle--from the extraction of fissionable 
material to the reprocessing of irradiated fuel. 
  Nuclear power plants produced 120 billion kilowatt-hours of 
electric power in 1992. 
  Harmful substances from stationary sources are emitted into 
the atmosphere by 104* enterprises. The total quantity in 1992 
was 1,159,500* tonnes, with 918,800* tonnes (or 77.1 percent*) 
recovered in traps. The total quantity of contaminants 
discharged into the atmosphere was 51,700* tonnes below the 
figure for the previous year because of improvements in 
technological processes and the reduction of production volumes. 
  Enterprises of the branch used a total of 6.3 billion* 
m[.sup]3[/] of water, including 4 billion* m[.sup]3[/] of 
sea water. The main water consumers were the Kola and Leningrad 
AES's--67 percent of the total. Recycling systems reduced fresh 
water consumption for production needs by 12.5 billion* 
m[.sup]3[/], and the recycling rate for the branch as a whole 
was 66.8 percent*. 
  The quantity of polluted sewage discharged (of the total 
quantity of 6.1 billion* m[.sup]3[/] of waste water) was 16.4 
million* m[.sup]3[/]--a reduction of 13.8 million* 
m[.sup]3[/] in comparison with the 1991 figure. Enterprises 
of the branch dumped 119,500 tonnes of various substances in 
polluted sewage and treated sewage meeting standard requirements 
in 1992. 
  In the past year 23 enterprises dumped 975.9 million 
m[.sup]3[/] of sewage, containing radionuclides with total 
activity of 268 kc (almost 100 percent in the waters of the 
Arctic seas). Most were short-lived isotopes. 
  The area of damaged lands totaled 52,263 hectares by the end 
of 1992, with 16 hectares reclaimed during the year. 
  Capital investments totaling 1.29 billion* rubles were used 
in nuclear power engineering for environmental protection and 
resource conservation. 
<H5>  3.2. Metallurgical Complex </H5>
  Production figures continued to decline in metallurgy in 
1992. The output of rolled metal was 15 percent* below the 1991 
figure, the output of steel pipe was 23 percent* below, and 
decreases in the output of nonferrous metals were 25 percent* 
for refined copper, 13 percent* for nickel, 23 percent* for 
lead, 15 percent* for zinc, and 41 percent* for tin. 
  Enterprises of the complex were responsible for more than 28 
percent of all harmful emissions from stationary sources in the 
Russian Federation in 1992. The largest quantities of pollutants 
were discharged by the Norilsk GMK [mining and metallurgical 
combine], the Kuznetsk, West Siberian, Magnitogorsk, 
Cherepovets, Novolipetsk, and Nizhniy Tagil metallurgical 
combines, and the Pechenganikel and Severonikel combines. 
  This was due either to the inefficient operation of existing 
air filters and gas traps or to their absence. Only 38 percent 
of all the substances in waste gases are trapped and neutralized 
at the Norilsk GMK, which is responsible for 8 percent of all 
the pollutants discharged into the atmosphere in the Russian 
Federation, and the figure at the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical 
Combine is 51 percent. The most common pollutants are dust, 
sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen 
sulfide, phenol, formaldehyde, and heavy metals. 
  The emission figures for all of the enterprises under the 
jurisdiction of the RF Committee on Metallurgy were 488,000* 
tonnes (or 11.5 percent) below the 1991 figures. 
  Emissions were lower by 108,000* tonnes (13 percent) for 
solid matter, 20,600* tonnes (9.7 percent) for nitrogen oxides, 
285,200* tonnes (11.8 percent) for carbon monoxide, and 64,000* 
tonnes (8 percent) for sulfur dioxide. 
  New equipment to trap and neutralize waste gases had a 
combined capacity of 3.609 million* m[.sup]3[/]/hr. 
  Fresh water consumption in the metallurgical complex was the 
same in 1992 as in 1991, and the quantity of polluted sewage 
decreased slightly. 
  The largest quantities of polluted sewage are dumped by the 
Novolipetsk, Cherepovets, Kuznetsk, Nizhniy Tagil, and 
Magnitogorsk metallurgical combines, the Kovdor and Lovozerskiy 
ore-dressing combines, the Ural Aluminum Plant, the Lysva 
Metallurgical Plant, the Pervouralsk Pipe Plant, and the 
Sevuralboksitruda Production Association. 
  Sewage treatment plants could not clean waste water to the 
required degree because of overloading, inefficient performance, 
obsolescence, and overuse. This, in turn, is causing the 
dramatic deterioration of hydrochemical conditions in bodies of 
water within the metallurgical enterprises' zones of operation. 
  Several enterprises of the branch stepped up their water 
conservation efforts. Discharges of polluted sewage into the 
Volga River were reduced by 11.3 million* m[.sup]3[/] by the 
Krasnyy Oktyabr Metallurgical Plant in Volgograd, discharges 
into the Lake Ladoga basin were reduced by 3.7 million* 
m[.sup]3[/] by the Alumina Plant in Boksitogorsk, and the 
Glinozem Production Association in Pikalevsk completely stopped 
dumping this kind of sewage. Less polluted sewage was dumped 
into the Lake Baykal basin by the Dzhidinsk Tungsten-Molybdenum 
Combine. 
  The use of new reagents--phosphonates--has permitted the 
installation of recycling systems at metallurgical enterprises 
in recent years. 
  Although water conservation projects have either been 
suspended or are being carried out extremely slowly, sewage 
treatment facilities handling 29,700* m[.sup]3[/] a day and 
recycling systems for 1,968,600* m[.sup]3[/] a day were put 
into operation. 
  Seepage from the many tanks holding all types of waste in 
the 
metallurgical complex is inflicting considerable damage on the 
water table. The polluted area of the water table below the 
Magnitogorsk Combine exceeds 150 km[.sup]2[/], and the 
Krasnyy Oktyabr Plant in Volgograd has polluted a 
20-km[.sup]2[/] area with iron, sulfates, and petroleum 
products in quantities 5-10 times the MAC. 
  Enterprises of Roskommetallurgiya [RF Committee on 
Metallurgy] annually reclaim virtually all of the land they have 
damaged as soon as they finish working the deposits on these 
lands (568.4* hectares in 1992), but these account for only 
around 2 percent* of the total area of damaged land. 
  Environmental construction projects in 1992 were financed 
exclusively by the enterprises' own funds. Capital investments 
in this area amounted to around 7.4 billion* rubles. 
<H3>  Norilskiy Nikel Russian State Nonferrous and Precious Metals 
Production Concern </H3>
  The enterprises of the Norilsiy Nikel Russian State 
Nonferrous and Precious Metals Production Concern, which produce 
75 percent of Russia's nickel, copper, and cobalt, occupy a 
special position in terms of production scales and environmental 
impact. 
  The locations of the concern's enterprises are distinguished 
by their ecological vulnerability. The unfavorable 
physico-geographic and natural-climatic conditions of the polar 
regions are the reason for their lower level of assimilation in 
comparison with the central latitudes. The emissions of the 
concern's enterprises create streams of pollutants which travel 
long distances. The concern's main enterprises are located in 
two ecologically distressed regions: the Taymyr Peninsula and 
Murmansk Oblast. 
  The emissions consist mainly of sulfur dioxide--around 95.4 
percent, and dust--1.9 percent. Recycling rates for the concern 
as a whole are 10.5 percent for the sulfur dioxide and 95.5 
percent for the dust. The concern's enterprises are responsible 
for more than 80 percent of all sulfur dioxide emissions in 
Murmansk Oblast and around 30 percent of these emissions in the 
Russian Federation. 
  In accordance with the sulfur dioxide emission limits 
specified in the Convention on Trans-Border Air Pollution, the 
concern's enterprises in Murmansk Oblast reduced these emissions 
by 26.7 percent in 1992 in comparison with the 1980 figure. 
Further reductions will be virtually impossible unless 
metallurgical production units are remodeled. 
  The total water consumption of the concern's main 
enterprises 
amounted to 239.2 million m[.sup]3[/]. Around 45.5 percent of 
this water is used for household needs because the enterprises 
of the concern own housing in the cities where they are located. 
  Over 75 percent of this water is used by the Norilsk Mining 
and Metallurgical Combine (GMK), and its sewage releases exceed 
80 percent of the total. Around 92 percent of the water used for 
industrial purposes at the Norilsk GMK is recycled. 
  All of the sewage of the Severonikel Combine is treated 
prior 
to dumping, whereas 18 percent of the sewage of the Norilsk GMK 
and 43 percent of the sewage of the Pechenganikel Combine is 
released untreated. 
  Sulfates and chlorides are the main pollutants discharged by 
the concern's enterprises into bodies of water. The combined 
discharges of these substances by the Norilsk GMK and the 
Severonikel Combine amount to 136,500 tonnes. 
  Copper and nickel discharged with industrial sewage in 1992 
amounted to 129.9 tonnes, and 69.8 percent came from the 
Severonikel Combine. 
  The dumping of polluted sewage by the concern's enterprises 
affects the basins of the Kara (Norilsk GMK) and Barents 
(Pechenganikel and Severonikel combines) seas. The content of 
several pollutants in the bodies of water serving as receptacles 
for the sewage exceeds the allowable concentration, but even the 
background concentrations of copper and nickel in natural 
reservoirs exceed the limits for fisheries. 
  Water quality in the regions where the concern's enterprises 
are located has stabilized and is even improving steadily in 
terms of some indicators. 
  Specialists from scientific research institutes are 
assisting 
in the planning of several projects for the remodeling of 
reservoirs of the Norilo-Pyasinsk network. 
  The concern's enterprises spent a total of 7.8 billion 
rubles 
on environmental projects in 1992, including 49 million* in 
capital investments. 
<H5>  3.3. Chemical and Petrochemical Complex </H5>
  The chemical and petrochemical complex includes enterprises 
of the chemical, petrochemical, agrochemical, and 
microbiological branches of industry in all parts of the country. 
  The ecologically unsatisfactory production units in this 
complex are sources of air pollution by many specific substances 
in concentrations far in excess of the allowable limit. 
  Enterprises of the complex discharged around 1.6 million* 
tonnes of pollutants into the atmosphere in 1992, representing 
around 6 percent* of all emissions in the Russian Federation. 
  These emissions are the main reason for soil pollution by 
metals in excess of the MAC within a radius of 5 kilometers 
around the cities where these enterprises are located. 
  In 1992 the enterprises of the complex used 2.6 
km[.sup]3[/] of fresh water. They dumped 2.9 km[.sup]3[/] 
of sewage, including 2.4 km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage, 
into bodies of water. The quantity of sewage dumped exceeded the 
quantity of water used because the sewage treatment plants of 
several large enterprises handle the waste of other enterprises 
and residential communities. 
  Around 80 percent of the 2.9 km[.sup]3[/] of sewage was 
polluted, attesting to the extremely inefficient performance of 
the sewage treatment plants maintained by the enterprises. 
  The sewage contains large quantities of sulfates, chlorides, 
phosphorus and nitrogen compounds, petroleum products, and 
specific substances: formaldehyde, methanol, benzene, hydrogen 
sulfide, carbon disulfide, compounds of heavy metals, mercury, 
arsenic, cyanide, and others. 
  This is having a negative effect on the hydrochemical state 
of bodies of water. The water in the Belaya River above 
Sterlitamak, for example, has a grade III quality rating 
(``moderately polluted''), but below the city it drops to grade 
IV (``contaminated''). Virtually the same thing happens to the 
water in the Oka River after discharges of sewage from the 
plants in Dzerzhinsk, which increases the content of methanol, 
cyanide, and formaldehyde dramatically. Conditions in the 
Chapayevka River are deteriorating just as dramatically. The 
water there is virtually unfit for use after discharges of 
sewage from the Chapayevsk Chemical Fertilizer Plant because of 
high levels of pollution by pesticides. 
  The enterprises of the complex are polluting ground water 
with metals, methanol, and phenol in concentrations reaching as 
high as hundreds of thousands of times the MAC in areas 
measuring dozens of square kilometers, precluding the use of the 
water table for the supply of drinking water. 
<H5>  3.4. Timber and Wood Chemical Industry </H5>
  The largest logging regions in Russia are Irkutsk Oblast, 
with 11 percent of the total felling area in the country, 
Krasnoyarsk Kray--12 percent, Khabarovsk Kray--6 percent, Tyumen 
Oblast--6 percent, the Komi Republic--5 percent, and Arkhangelsk 
Oblast--4 percent. The felling limits of these krays and oblasts 
constitute 44 percent of the total limit in Russia. 
  Felling operations in 1992 were equivalent to 42 percent of 
the limit, including 47 percent for conifers. In the main 
logging regions the figure ranged from 24.6 percent in 
Krasnoyarsk Kray to 68 percent in Arkhangelsk Oblast, including 
a range of 34-80 percent for conifers. 
  Only Murmansk Oblast came close to the limit: 79 percent in 
the whole felling area and in coniferous forests. 
  The remaining wood left in the cutting area subject to sale 
throughout Russia amounted to 6 million* m[.sup]3[/], or 2.6 
percent* of all of the lumber cut in 1992, which was 1 percent 
above the 1991 figure. The quantity of timber in areas of 
unfinished felling operations amounted to 6.2 million* 
m[.sup]3[/], or 24 percent* more than in 1991, and 
represented 2.7 percent* of all the timber cut in 1991. Wood 
abandoned on the cutting site in 1992 amounted to 2.6 million* 
m[.sup]3[/] (101.2 percent* of the 1991 figure)--i.e., 1.1 
percent* of the output of lumber in 1992. 
  The largest timber industry complexes (LPK), pulp and paper 
combines (TsBK), and cellulose plants (TsZ) in the Russian 
Federation are concentrated in a few regions: 
  East Siberian--Bratsk LPK, Baykalsk TsBK, Ust-Ilimskiy LPK, 
Krasnoyarsk TsBK; 
  Northern--Arkhangelsk TsBK, Kotlas TsBK, Solombalskiy TsBK, 
Syktyvkar LPK, Kondopozh TsBK, Pitkyarant TsZ, Segezh TsBK; 
  Northwestern--Syaskiy TsBK, Svetogorskiy TsBK; 
  Kaliningrad Oblast--Kaliningrad TsBK's, Sovetskiy TsBZ [pulp 
and paper plant], Neman TsBZ; 
  Urals--Solikamskiy TsBK, Vishera TsBK, Krasnokamsk TsBK, 
Perm 
TsBK, Turin TsBZ, Lyalsk TsBK. 
  Economic difficulties in 1992 resulted in production cuts at 
enterprises of the timber and wood chemical complex. Decreases 
in output were equivalent to 11.4 percent for pulp, 24.3 percent 
for paper, 18 percent for cardboard, and 13 percent for 
commercial timber. 
<H5>  [No 24, 1993 pp 6-13] </H5>
  The enterprises of the branch annually release over 700,000 
tonnes of pollutants into the atmosphere. Neutralizing equipment 
is so ineffective that it traps only 78 percent of the 
pollutants emitted from stationary sources, and the most typical 
of these are acetone, formaldehyde, phenol, xylene, toluene, 
butyl acetate, carbon disulfide, and methyl mercaptan. 
  The production activities of enterprises of the complex 
pollute the air in the cities of Arkhangelsk, Bratsk, 
Krasnoyarsk, and Perm. 
  The enterprises of the complex used around 2.5 billion 
m[.sup]3[/] of fresh water a year, or 5 percent of the total 
amount consumed by Russian industry. Around 69 percent* is 
reused or recycled (around 77 percent* for RF industry as a 
whole). The reason is that fresh water is one of the raw 
materials used in several technological processes. 
  Enterprise sewage contains such pollutants as sulfates, 
chlorides, nitrites and nitrates, organic sulfur compounds, 
methanol, formaldehyde, furfural, tannin, and turpentine. 
  The construction of sewage treatment facilities has not been 
completed at some enterprises, although their completion is long 
overdue (scheduled completion dates of 1977 for the Visherskiy 
TsBK, 1985 for the Kaliningrad TsBK and Neman and Sovetskiy 
TsBZ's, and 1990 for the Kotlas TsBK). 
  The result has been the severe pollution of bodies of water 
near the enterprises of the complex. The water in the Vikhorevka 
River, for example, is where more than half of the sewage from 
the Bratsk LPK is dumped. The water in the monitored section has 
lost its grade III quality rating (``moderately polluted'') and 
has been reclassified as grade VII (``extremely contaminated''); 
after releases of sewage from the Visherskiy TsBK, the grade III 
water in the Vishera River turns into grade VII (``highly 
contaminated''). 
  The sedimentation tanks and even the production areas of the 
enterprises have a negative impact on the quality of ground 
water. The polluted area of the water table of the Selenginsk 
TsKK covers 70 square kilometers, and the content of harmful 
substances in the water exceeds the permissible quantity by 10 
times. The content of formaldehyde, furfural, and phenol in 
ground water near the Krasnoyarsk TsBK is even further in excess 
of permissible limits. 
  In all, enterprises of the complex used 1.6 billion* rubles 
in capital investments from various sources in 1992 for 
environmental protection and resource conservation. These 
included 95 million* rubles for the protection of water 
resources and 6 million* for air protection. New sewage 
treatment facilities completed in 1992 had a combined capacity 
of 8,100* m[.sup]3[/]/day and new equipment to trap and 
neutralize the pollutants in waste gases had a combined capacity 
of 150,000* m[.sup]3[/]/hr. 
<H5>  3.5. Machine-Building Complex </H5>
  The machine-building complex includes heavy, power 
engineering, transport, motor vehicle, machine tool, tractor, 
and agricultural machine building, the electrical equipment 
industry, instrument building, and other branches. 
  Enterprises of the complex are located in virtually all 
regions, but the enterprises with the largest output are in the 
big industrial cities in Moscow, Leningrad, Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk, Samara,Vladimir, Rostov, and Kemerovo 
oblasts, Krasnoyarsk and Altay krays, and the republics of 
Tatarstan and Bashkortostan. 
  These enterprises use 2.9* km[.sup]3[/] of fresh water a 
year, or 6 percent of the total amount used in production in 
Russia. 
  The amount used in recycling systems is 12.9* 
km[.sup]3[/], producing a savings of around 81.5 percent* in 
fresh water consumption. 
  The sewage released into surface bodies of water by the 
machine-building complex amounts to 2.438 billion* 
m[.sup]3[/], including 1.279 billion* m[.sup]3[/] (or 52.5 
percent) of polluted sewage, 975 million* m[.sup]3[/] (or 40 
percent) of clean waste water not requiring treatment, and 184 
million* m[.sup]3[/] (7.5 percent) of treated sewage meeting 
quality standards. 
  The main pollutants determining the quality of sewage are 
petroleum products, sulfates, suspended matter, and compounds of 
nitrogen, iron, copper, zinc, nickel, and chromium. 
  Enterprises of the complex have a negative impact on water 
quality in the Volga, Yenisey, Chulym, Miass, Iset, and other 
rivers. 
  Seepage from tanks and production areas has polluted the 
ground water in Tolyatti (VAZ), Yekaterinburg (URALMASH), and 
Moscow (ZIL) with phenol, heavy metal compounds, and other 
substances to levels far in excess of the permissible quantity. 
  The enterprises of the machine-building complex have 
365,000* 
stationary sources of pollution, including 352,000* established 
facilities. Combined emissions of atmospheric pollutants from 
the stationary sources of machine-building enterprises represent 
5.6 percent* of the emissions of these substances by all of 
Russian industry. 
  The emissions of 567* enterprises in 1992 exceeded 1991 
figures. 
  Total emissions amounted to around 1.6 million* tonnes in 
the 
year. Around 2.3 million* tonnes (or 59.3 percent*) of the 
pollutants in waste gases were trapped and neutralized, and 1.3 
million* were released without any kind of purification. 
  The most typical substances released by enterprises of the 
complex into the atmosphere are ammonia, acetone, xylene, 
toluene, styrene, butyl acetate, fluorides, nickel, chromium, 
lead, manganese, acids, benzene, ethyl acetate, copper, alcohol, 
oil, various types of dust, and others. 
  In 1992 the machine-building complex used 2 billion* rubles 
in capital investments for the protection and intelligent use of 
natural resources (1.6 billion* for water protection and 32 
million* for air protection), representing 4 percent of all the 
capital investments in environmental protection in Russia. The 
protection and efficient use of land in 1992 cost 32.5 million* 
rubles in the complex. 
  New sewage treatment plants installed at enterprises of the 
complex last year had a total capacity of 41,200 
m[.sup]3[/]/day. 
  The capacity of new equipment to trap and neutralize the 
pollutants in waste gases amounted to 545,000* m[.sup]3[/] of 
gas. 
  No new recycling systems were installed at enterprises of 
the 
complex in 1992. 
<H5>  3.6. Construction Complex </H5>
  The environmental impact of the construction complex 
consists 
of large quantities of solid and gaseous substances released 
into the air during the stages of open-cut mining and during the 
production of cement, asbestos cement, reinforced concrete 
items, and roofing and insulation materials. 
  The total quantity of pollutants released into the 
atmosphere 
by enterprises of the construction complex in 1992 was around 3 
million tonnes, which was slightly less than in the previous 
year (because of production cuts). Most of the emissions--around 
2.1 million tonnes (70 percent)--came from enterprises producing 
nonmetalliferous materials. The cement industry was responsible 
for 200,000 tonnes, asbestos cement production accounted for 
300,000 tonnes, and enterprises producing roofing and insulation 
materials were responsible for more than 200,000 tonnes. 
  In addition to stationary sources, the dust discharged by 
explosions and by open-cut mining has a significant effect on 
air quality. 
  Construction materials production pollutes the air with 
benzpyrene, soot, sulfur dioxide, hydrocarbons, and 
formaldehyde, in addition to dust and suspended matter. 
  The negative effects of enterprises of the construction 
complex on air quality are perceptible in the cities of 
Krasnodar, Novosibirsk, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, Saratov, 
Ulan-Ude, Novorossiysk, Barnaul, and Iskitim. 
  The enterprises where most of the waste is treated 
mechanically cannot provide for effective sewage treatment. The 
largest quantities of polluted sewage are dumped by the 
Uralasbest Combine in Asbest in Sverdlovsk Oblast, the 
Kovdorslyuda Ore-Dressing Combine in Kovdor in Murmansk Oblast, 
and the Bryansktsement Production Association in Fokino in 
Bryansk Oblast. They are polluting bodies of water with 
suspended matter, petroleum products, ammonium nitrate, and 
nitrates. 
  The extraction of natural resources for the construction 
complex has led to the use of large areas of land for mining. 
The total area of damaged lands in Russia amounted to 27,000 
hectares in 1992, and the depleted area amounted to 10,000 
hectares. Less than 10 percent was reclaimed. 
<H5>  3.7. Transport and Highway Complex </H5>
  The transport and highway complex is a major source of 
environmental pollution. Around 89 percent of the 35 million 
tonnes of harmful emissions are vehicle emissions and substances 
released by the highway construction complex, railroads produce 
8 percent, airlines produce around 2 percent, and water 
transport is responsible for around 1 percent. 
  Transportation plays a significant role in water pollution, 
and transportation is also one of the main sources of noise in 
cities and makes a sizable contribution to thermal environmental 
pollution. 
<H5>  Motor Transport </H5>
  Vehicle emissions in Russia amount to around 22 million 
tonnes a year. 
  The exhaust of internal combustion engines contains more 
than 
200 different harmful substances and compounds, including 
carcinogens. Petroleum products, the products of worn tires and 
brake linings, loose granulated and powdered freight, and the 
chlorides used for the de-icing of highways pollute the roadside 
and bodies of water. 
  Stationary sources of air pollution at motor transport 
enterprises of state jurisdiction (boilers and fans in 
enterprise shops and sections) released 52,000 tonnes of 
pollutants into the atmosphere in 1992. 
  The polluted sewage of motor transport enterprises exceeded 
8 
million* m[.sup]3[/] in 1992, or 0.1 percent* of all 
industrial sewage in Russia. 
<H5>  Highway Construction Complex </H5>
  Asphalt plants produce the most serious air pollution 
because 
the emissions of these enterprises contain carcinogens. The 
asphalt mixers currently in use in Russia release from 70 to 300 
tonnes of suspended matter a year. A random survey indicated 
that all of these mixers had inefficient cleaning equipment 
because of design flaws, wear and tear, and the failure to 
perform regular maintenance operations. 
  Mobile objects used in the construction, repair, and 
maintenance of public highways annually release 450,000 tonnes 
of dust, soot, and other harmful substances. Stationary sources 
produce over 130,000 tonnes of pollutants. 
  The same enterprises dump 43 million m[.sup]3[/] of 
polluted sewage into surface bodies of water each year. 
<H5>  Air Transport </H5>
  The considerable reduction of air traffic in 1992 reduced 
the 
total amount of atmospheric emissions in this branch to 280,000 
tonnes (as compared to 308,000 tonnes in 1991). Stationary 
sources released 42,000 tonnes of pollutants, which was the same 
as the 1991 figure, and only 18 percent of all the released 
substances were trapped and neutralized. 
  The impermissible noise levels of aircraft in residential 
communities adjacent to the airports of the civil aviation 
network are creating serious problems. The noise characteristics 
of modern domestic planes in operation for a long time are 
inferior to the characteristics of foreign aircraft. This has 
led to a perceptible rise in the percentage of people suffering 
from aviation noise, mainly as a result of the geographic 
expansion of airports serving planes with higher noise levels 
(Il-76T, Kl-86, and others) than earlier aircraft. 
  Around 2-3 percent of the population of Russia is now 
exposed 
to aviation noise exceeding permissible limits. 
<H5>  Rail Transport </H5>
  In 1992 emissions from stationary sources in this branch 
were 
estimated at 465,000 tonnes, and only 28.6 percent (as compared 
to 29.4 percent in 1991) of the pollutants were trapped and 
neutralized, while 331,500 tonnes were released into the 
atmosphere (98,200 tonnes of solids, 122,600 tonnes of carbon 
monoxide, and 21,500 tonnes of nitrogen oxide). Emissions from 
mobile sources were estimated at over 2 million tonnes. 
  The most harmful effects are produced by the metallurgical 
production units, and particularly the foundries, of branch 
enterprises, the remodeling of which has been delayed by 
problems with financing and equipment deliveries. Environmental 
projects had to be financed mainly by the enterprises 
themselves. In spite of this, several measures were taken in the 
branch to replace obsolete smelting units with ecologically 
superior equipment. 
  The branch dumped 70 million* m[.sup]3[/] of sewage into 
bodies of water in 1992, including 66.6 million* m[.sup]3[/] 
of polluted sewage. 
  Accidents involving trains carrying hazardous freight were 
caused by railroad schedule violations, defective rolling stock, 
and the overuse of rolling stock and caused environmental damage 
in several cases. 
  Sewage treatment stations capable of handling 4,000* 
m[.sup]3[/]/day were started up in 1992. 
<H5>  River Transport </H5>
  On 1 January 1993 the state river transport network 
consisted 
of 136 ports, 97 industrial enterprises, and 14 waterway and 
canal production associations. 
  Each year (according to 1990 data) during the navigation 
season, the vessels of the river fleet produce around 3 million 
m[.sup]3[/] of ordinary sewage, 550,000 m[.sup]3[/] of 
sewage containing petroleum, and 26,000 tonnes of garbage. The 
total quantity of all types of waste produced by the boats of 
the Russian river fleet is relatively small and is comparable to 
the waste of a city with a population of around 250,000. 
  Most of the water used by coastal facilities of the river 
transport is for normal household purposes and the supply of 
drinking water (57 percent) because of the large quantity of 
housing these enterprises maintain for river transport workers. 
  The most highly polluted sewage generated by production 
facilities in the branch comes from electroplating sections and 
shops. Around 25 percent of the enterprises have sewage 
treatment plants where production waste is processed before it 
is released into the sewer system. 
  The amount of polluted sewage dumped in 1992 reached 5 
million* m[.sup]3[/], and the amount of water in recycling 
systems amounted to 1.1* million m[.sup]3[/]. 
  Atmospheric emissions from stationary sources amounted to 
44,100* tonnes in 1990, 41,600* tonnes in 1991, and 42,670* 
tonnes in 1992--70 percent gaseous and 30 percent solid 
substances. 
  In Russia, just as in the rest of the world, there are no 
emission standards for the exhaust of diesel-powered vessels. 
<H5>  Maritime Transport </H5>
  The 10 Russian maritime shipping lines have 799 transport 
ships, including 683 dry-cargo ships, 99 tankers, and 17 oil and 
ore carriers. 
  The main types of waste produced by the ships are bilge and 
ballast fluid containing oil, the waste products of fuel and oil 
separation, oil residue and sludge, and oily rags. 
  Ships and enterprises of the maritime fleet used 26.1 
million* m[.sup]3[/] of water in 1992, the amount recycled 
was 9.36 million* m[.sup]3[/], and the amount of polluted 
sewage released was 10.7 million* m[.sup]3[/]. 
  The ships of the Russian merchant fleet are now based in 37 
ports. As a result of port operations involving the 
transshipment and storage of dry free-flowing cargo, many of 
which are performed outside because of the absence of the 
necessary quantity of specialized facilities, substantial 
quantities of pollutants enter the environment. Part of the 
cargo is carried away by rains, and part enters bodies of water, 
the soil, and vegetation in the form of dust. 
  At this time standard dumping limits and emission standards 
have been set for virtually all shipyards and ports. 
  Emissions from stationary sources of pollution at 
enterprises 
of the Russian maritime fleet amounted to 55,800 tonnes in 1992, 
and the merchant fleet used 4.08 million tonnes of fuel measured 
in conventional units. 
<H5>  3.8. Armed Forces and Defense Industry </H5>
<H5>  Armed Forces </H5>
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Defense makes use of 12.8 
million hectares of land, consisting of the land occupied by 
garrisons and by reserve airfields, artillery position areas, 
the security zones of particularly important installations, 
military tree farms and sovkhozes, auxiliary facilities, and so 
forth. 
  The Ministry of Defense has more than 1,200 large 
installations with separate supply lines. 
  The most serious sources of air pollution in the armed 
forces 
are garrison boilers operating on solid fuel, batteries, motor 
vehicles, and combat equipment. All military installations 
combined release up to 300,000 tonnes of harmful substances into 
the atmosphere each year, representing 0.8 percent of all 
emissions in Russia. 
  In 1992 the total quantity of water used for military needs 
amounted to 26 billion m[.sup]3[/], and around 22 billion 
m[.sup]3[/] of sewage was released into surface bodies of 
water (less than 0.1 percent of the sewage of all housing and 
public utilities in Russia). 
  Several military installations, particularly in the Far East 
District, discharge some untreated household sewage (around 40 
percent of the total). Naval bases with coastal installations 
dump up to 453,000 m[.sup]3[/] a sewage a day, equivalent to 
around 5 percent of the amount of polluted sewage dumped by 
Russian maritime transport, and only 210,000 
m[.sup]3[/]--around 40 percent--undergoes treatment. 
  The number of missile tests decreased dramatically in 1992. 
The total area of the booster component landing zone allocated 
to the Ministry of Defense is 9 million km[.sup]2[/]. Rocket 
fuel components--substances in the first hazard 
category--accumulated in some parts of the Plesetsk test range 
over many years of use. At this time, there are no highly 
efficient technologies to clean up accidental spills of rocket 
fuel components, particularly in areas which are not easily 
accessible (marshes, mountains, tundra, etc.). 
  Air defense forces are facing the same problem. The arming 
of 
troops with new types of missiles has caused the accumulation of 
components of the rocket fuels of the old systems, which amount 
to around 30,000 tonnes in all. There is no technology for 
processing them either. 
  Leaks and spills of petroleum products and of fuel and 
lubricants are a major problem in the armed forces. The annual 
consumption of these exceeds 10 million tonnes. Most of the fuel 
depots and airfields were designed and built in 1956-1960, and 
no funds have been allocated for their repair and remodeling. 
For this reason, the absence, inoperability, or inferiority of 
environmental protective facilities in many fuel and lubricant 
depots can cause large fuel leaks and the pollution of surface 
and ground water and contribute to the creation of large 
lenticles. The practice of dumping unused fuel when planes come 
in for a landing has permeated the soil with kerosene on the 
grounds of some airfields. 
  The seas are also being polluted by petroleum products from 
the ships and boats of the Navy, particularly near naval bases, 
although the content of petroleum products in the water of these 
bases has been reduced to 5-10 times the MAC in recent years. 
The Navy's supply of vessels collecting bilge and ballast fluid 
and of floating sewage treatment facilities is just over 50 
percent of the total requirement, just as it is in the maritime 
fleet. 
  Novaya Zemlya is suffering from a unique environmental 
problem caused by military operations. It is the result of the 
air, surface, underground, and underwater nuclear tests that 
began to be conducted here in 1957, of the creation and 
deployment of the fleet of atomic ice-breakers, nuclear 
submarines, and nuclear-powered surface ships, and of the 
dumping of radioactive waste in the sea. 
  The absence of financing for environmental projects has 
created a particularly critical ecological situation in regions 
of military installations, and conditions have continued to 
deteriorate. The anthropogenic effects of military garrisons on 
the ecosystem, however, are commensurate with the influences of 
small or medium-sized industrial enterprises, and the total area 
of ecologically dangerous territories created through the fault 
of the armed forces constitutes less than 0.1 percent of the 
total area of these zones in Russia. 
<H5>  Defense Industry </H5>
  Because of the distinctive features of their operations (the 
production, accumulation, or destruction of weapons), 
enterprises of the defense complex are a serious source of 
environmental pollution. Their influence is quite strong in such 
regions as Leningrad, Vladimir, Nizhniy Novgorod, Perm, Omsk, 
Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk, Tomsk, and Moscow oblasts and 
Krasnoyarsk, Khabarovsk, and Maritime krays. The operations of 
defense industry enterprises are a source of high ecological 
risks and regularly create large-scale emergencies (the Mayak 
scientific-production association and others). 
  The main aspects of the environmental impact of defense 
industry facilities have not been analyzed sufficiently yet with 
a view to the present state of the most toxic chemicals and 
radioactive substances used in production in the past and the 
biological safety of current technological processes. 
  The emissions of defense industry enterprises in 1992 were 
estimated at around 700,000 tonnes, or more than 3 percent of 
all emissions in the Russian Federation. The main sources of 
pollution are boiler rooms and TETs [heat and power plants], 
metallurgical production units, and enterprises producing 
special chemicals. In spite of the low percentage of gross 
emissions of harmful substances by enterprises of the complex, 
the emissions are dangerous because they contain such substances 
as benzpyrene, metal oxides, and certain types of hydrocarbons 
in addition to dust, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. Only 
30 percent of the enterprises of the complex are staying below 
emission limits. 
  The complex uses around 1.9 billion m[.sup]3[/] a year and 
dumps around 800 million m[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage each 
year, or more than 8 percent of all of the sewage of this 
category in industry. 
  The largest quantities of polluted sewage are dumped by the 
Kirovskiy Zavod Production Association and enterprises in the 
cities of Kovrov and Aleksandrov (Vladimir Oblast), Nizhniy 
Novgorod and Zhukov (Moscow Oblast), Chelyabinsk and other 
cities in that oblast, and Krasnoyarsk and other cities in that 
kray. The sewage contains heavy metal salts, petroleum products, 
phenols, hydrocarbons, and other pollutants. 
  Radioactive waste disposal (see Section 1.9) is now the main 
problem in the defense complex. 
  The present state, operations, and environmental impact of 
radiochemical and chemical production units and enterprises 
producing explosives constitute another major problem. 
Environmental conditions in Tomsk Oblast (in the city of 
Tomsk-7) and Samara Oblast (in Chapayevsk) are an example of 
this. 
<H5>  3.9. Agroindustrial Complex </H5>
  The agroindustrial complex consists of agriculture and the 
branches processing agricultural products. 
  Agriculture takes around 37* km[.sup]3[/] of fresh water 
out of reservoirs each year (33 percent of the total intake in 
the Russian Federation). Losses during transport amount to 
around 17 percent* of the total. A large portion (15* 
km[.sup]3[/]) is used for irrigation. The total amount 
discharged is 14.9* km[.sup]3[/], 13.6* km[.sup]3[/] of 
which ends up in surface bodies of water, while the rest is 
diverted to natural depressions in the landscape (trenches, 
pits, etc.). Agriculture accounts for around 40 percent* of all 
of the untreated sewage released in the country. 
  In 1992 the use of chemicals caused less environmental 
damage. In comparison with the average annual figures for 
1986-1990, the quantity of mineral fertilizers used decreased 
from 99 kilograms per hectare of plowland to 43, the quantity of 
pesticides used decreased from 1.5 kg/ha to 0.9, and the 
quantity of organic fertilizers used decreased from 3.7 tonnes 
per hectare to 2.1. The total quantity of liquid manure on large 
animal husbandry complexes amounted to 130 million tonnes and 
was 13 percent below the 1991 figure. Many animal husbandry 
complexes are polluting surface water with nitrogen compounds. 
  Many of the rural enterprises processing agricultural 
products are equipped with inefficient waste treatment plants or 
do not have these plants, and this eventually leads to 
concentrated pollution. 
  Of the 10,000* enterprises of the processing branches of 
industry, only 40 percent* in the meat and dairy branch and 60* 
in the food industry are using municipal treatment plants or 
releasing sewage into reservoirs after biological treatment. 
Existing biological treatment plants cannot meet the necessary 
standards. Because of this, the sewage of meat and dairy plants 
is only 83 percent clean, and the sewage of canneries is only 60 
percent clean. 
  The incorporation of waste-free and low-waste, 
resource-conserving technologies is becoming increasingly 
significant because they would minimize releases of production 
waste into the sewer system. 
  Agriculture pollutes the air with the emissions of boiler 
houses, obsolete refrigeration equipment, and foul-smelling 
gases. There is usually no preliminary cleaning to remove 
pollutants. 
  Capital investments in environmental measures in the 
agroindustrial complex in 1992 amounted to 2.332 billion* rubles. 
  New sewage treatment facilities have a combined capacity of 
only 35,600* m[.sup]3[/]/day. There are no new recycling 
systems at all. 
  One alarming symptom in some parts of Russia is the 
unrestricted construction of small meat, dairy, and other 
enterprises where it will be difficult to arrange for the 
treatment of sewage, the recycling of production waste, and the 
control of raw material and product quality. This could have a 
negative environmental impact in the future. 
<H5>  3.10. Public Utilities </H5>
  Municipal services and public utilities are expected to 
secure the ecological safety of the population in residential 
communities. 
  These services and utilities take more than 15 
km[.sup]3[/] of fresh water out of reservoirs each year, but 
no more than 90 percent of the water reaches consumers because 
of losses in the water supply networks. 
  These networks supplies consumers with 21.6 km[.sup]3[/] 
of water in 1992, including 13.8 km[.sup]3[/] for household 
needs. Average daily water consumption increased to 344 liters 
per person, but there were still differences in water 
consumption in different parts of the countries. 
  In 1992 these enterprises diverted 13.4 km[.sup]3[/] of 
sewage into surface bodies of water. Only 7 percent* of the 
treated sewage was clean enough to meet standard requirements, 
and 93 percent* was still polluted when it was dumped. 
Furthermore, 1.4* km[.sup]3[/] was dumped untreated. Each 
year the sewage decontamination process produces around 80 
million m[.sup]3[/] of sediment. 
  The largest quantities of polluted sewage are dumped through 
municipal sewer systems in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhniy 
Novgorod, Krasnoyarsk, and Samara. 
  The contribution of public utilities to air pollution is 
created by around 15,000 municipal boilers emitting over 560,000 
tonnes of pollutants each year. Solid substances make up 30 
percent of the total (170,000 tonnes), and liquid and gaseous 
substances make up 60 percent (395,000 tonnes). They include 
110,000 tonnes of sulfur dioxide (a rise of 0.7 percent over the 
previous year's figure), 218,000 tonnes of carbon monoxide (a 
rise of 4 percent), 62,000 tonnes of nitrogen oxides (14 
percent), 510,000 tonnes of volatile organic compounds (0.7 
percent), and 3,000 tonnes of hydrocarbons (5 percent). Only 33 
percent of the waste solid and gaseous substances of public 
utilities are trapped and neutralized. 
  In 1992 there were from 1 to 3 violations of the operating 
rules of Russian municipal services and public utilities in 42 
different regions. The highest number of accidents (50.5 
percent) occurred in the heat supply network, and there were 33 
accidents (32 percent) in facilities of the water supply network 
and sewer system. 
  An analysis of these accidents indicates that the 
dilapidated 
state of networks and equipment was the cause of 31 accidents in 
the heat and power engineering network and 7 accidents in the 
water supply network and sewer system. Violations of operating 
regulations caused 34 accidents. Five accidents were caused by 
explosions in sewer pumping stations and by gas explosions in 
residential buildings. Spills of petroleum products caused two 
accidents, and another 19 accidents had natural causes. 
  The construction of sewers and sewage treatment plants cost 
17.9 billion* rubles in state capital investments in 1992 (29 
billion* in 1991, or an adjusted figure of 28 billion*), with 
12.9* billion rubles provided by local soviets (20.8 billion* in 
1991). 
  The operation of the sewage treatment plants of municipal 
systems (including leased enterprises), capable of handling 
314,600* m[.sup]3[/]/day, and 464.9* kilometers of sewer 
lines was financed by state capital investments in Russia. The 
respective figures for 1991 were 527* m[.sup]3[/]/day and 
661.2* kilometers. 
  In 1992, 305* kilometers (318* km in 1991) of sewer traps 
and 
sewage treatment facilities with a total capacity of 209,000* 
m[.sup]3[/]/day were installed and began operating. 
  In view of the fact that the public utilities are part of 
the 
system of public supply lines, a comprehensive program should be 
adopted on the federal level for the economic support of the 
municipal economy, including a separate group of measures for 
the quicker improvement of ecological conditions in cities. 
<H5>  3.11. Production and Consumption Waste </H5>
  The waste products of production and consumption are among 
the serious technogenic problems for the environment. 
  Due to the lack of economic incentives for enterprises, the 
low level of technology, the shortage of modern waste treatment 
equipment, and the overall lack of high standards in production 
and consumption, only a few dozen types of waste products are 
processed and used. Because of this, the rate of their creation 
and accumulation (including large-scale waste products) within 
the territory of Russia has not changed. 
  Around a billion cubic meters of waste products, for 
example, 
have accumulated in the dumps of coal industry enterprises, and 
less than 5 percent of this waste is ever used. The reduction of 
local disposal has decreased the quantity of waste products used 
by 4 percent (in comparison with the 1991 figure), down to 47 
percent of the total. 
  Each year TES's [thermal electric power plants] produce 
around 50 million tonnes of waste ash and cinder. Approximately 
4 million tonnes of this waste is processed. The total area 
occupied by ash heaps amounts to 19,400 hectares. 
  In 1992 the operations of the mining enterprises of 
Roskommetallurgiya [RF Committee on Metallurgy] led to the 
accumulation of around 250 million m[.sup]3[/] of stripping 
rock, and 68.8 million m[.sup]3[/] (or 27.5 percent) was used 
for various purposes, including 42.4 million m[.sup]3[/] used 
as filler for mine shafts and 18.2 million m[.sup]3[/] used 
in the production of building materials. The quantity of 
concentration tailings was around 132 million m[.sup]3[/], 
and around 27 million m[.sup]3[/] (20.4 percent) were used, 
including around 11 million used in the production of building 
materials and ballast. The stripping and tailings were used in 
the production of more than 20 million m[.sup]3[/] of gravel 
for the enterprises' own needs and the needs of other 
organizations. Several enterprises producing building materials 
use stripping as their basic raw material. 
  Accumulated metallurgical slag and clinker amounted to 
around 
5 [sic] million tonnes, and 41.7 [sic] million tonnes, or 92.6 
percent, were processed. All of the blast-furnace slag and 
clinker of the nickel-cobalt subbranch were used, 57 percent of 
the slag in the steel industry was recycled, and this was also 
true of 50 percent of the ferroalloy slag and 2 percent of the 
clinker in the copper industry. Metallurgical slag is used in 
the production of cement, construction gravel, pumice, steel 
wool, and other products. 
  Each year around 7 million tonnes of metallurgical slag and 
more than 10 million tonnes of concentration tailings, as well 
as 34 million m[.sup]3[/] of stripping rock, accumulate at 
enterprises of the Norilskiy Nikel concern. Over 350 million 
tonnes of metallurgical slag has accumulated in all of the waste 
heaps of the Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Combine and no 
more than 3 percent is being recycled. 
  Enterprises of the petroleum refining industry produce 1.1 
million tonnes of solid and liquid waste products each year, and 
around 80 percent are used at enterprises in the industry and in 
other industries. The waste products most likely to be used are 
sludge--98 percent, liquid organic products--99 percent, spent 
sulfuric acid--98 percent, the waste slurry of additive 
production--80 percent, and oil slime--65 percent. The waste 
products of synthetic fatty acid production, alkali-sulfur 
waste, the surplus activated sludge of biological sewage 
treatment plants, and used bleaching clay are almost never used. 
  Faulty technological processes are the cause of the 
accumulation of 115.3 million tonnes of solid and toxic waste 
products each year in the chemical industry. Only 32 percent are 
recycled, 25 million tonnes are burned or disposed of in dumps, 
and more than 50 million tonnes are stored in tanks. 
  Around 94 million tonnes of solid waste products and 97 
million tonnes of liquid waste products are accumulated in the 
agricultural chemicals industry, and 28 percent and 13.5 
percent, respectively, are recycled. Slime pits already occupy 
more than 10,000 hectares. Many pits are already full. 
  The heaviest waste product of basic chemistry is 
phosphogypsum--613 million tonnes a year. At this time, however, 
only 9 percent of the total is being recycled. More than 120 
million tonnes of sludge has accumulated in pits. 
  The calcareous waste of calcined lime production can amount 
to 700,000 tonnes a year; 79 percent of these waste products are 
being used. 
  The process for the derivation of synthetic fatty acids is 
accompanied by the creation of 350,000 tonnes of waste sulfates 
and 50,000 tonnes of waste acid; the respective levels of their 
use are 70 percent and 30 percent. 
  The use of chromium in the production of various items 
creates 333,000 tonnes of clinker containing chromium and 
calcium oxides. More than 8 million tonnes of these waste 
products, which are in the second hazard category, have 
accumulated in pits. Up to 311,000 tonnes of spent sulfuric acid 
is accumulated each year in the production of caustic soda, 
chlorine products, and other chemicals. The level of its use is 
80 percent, and the main user is the agrochemical industry. 
  The derivation of chlorine products also creates 56,000 
tonnes of organic chlorine waste, with a recycling rate of 27 
percent. 
  We have not taken full advantage of opportunities to recycle 
fundamentally reusable waste: worn tires (120,000 tonnes), waste 
containing rubber (170,000 tonnes is produced and 64 percent of 
it is reused), and the fibrous and solid waste of fiberglass 
production (36,000 tonnes is produced and 50 percent of it is 
reused). 
  The hazardous waste products of production and consumption, 
which are formed in quantities of around 75 million tonnes a 
year, are a special problem. Only 18 percent of these are 
recycled and neutralized. 
  The largest quantities of the waste products containing 
heavy 
and rare nonferrous metal salts and compounds of arsenic and 
hexavalent chromium (around 80 percent) are produced at 
metallurgical and agrochemical enterprises. Among the most 
hazardous industrial waste products created at enterprises of 
heavy and agricultural machine building and the chemical, 
petrochemical, and metallurgical industries, petroleum waste 
products occupy a prominent place (more than 600,000 tonnes), 
and so do waste products containing highly toxic substances 
(over 190,000 tonnes): benzpyrene, chlorinated and dechlorinated 
silicone monomers, and phenol compounds. 
  Nuclear power engineering enterprises are one source of 
hazardous waste. The enterprises of this branch produce more 
than 1.5 million tonnes of waste products a year: 22.4 percent 
are decontaminated and recycled, 46.4 percent are sent to 
special storage facilities, and 31.2 percent are turned over to 
other enterprises and agencies. Most of this waste consists of 
the byproducts of electroplating facilities (more than 2,200 
tonnes), waste containing mercury and its compounds (more than 
32,500 tonnes), inorganic fluorine compounds (over 37,000 
tonnes), and petroleum waste products (over 4,600 tonnes). 
Enterprises of the branch have accumulated more than 760,000 
tonnes of waste products from electroplating processes, 
containing nickel, chromium, cobalt, copper, and other metals. 
Slag is used in the production of ceramic structural elements, 
in glass production, and as additives in concrete and 
asphalt-concrete. Up to 95 percent of the waste products 
containing mercury and its compounds are sent to special storage 
sites. 
  Most of the hazardous waste (60 percent) produced within the 
territory of the Russian Federation is kept in special storage 
facilities. Most of the organized storage sites belong to 
enterprises of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy (where 69 
percent of their waste products are stored), the agrochemical 
complex (75 percent), and building materials production, 
primarily asbestos and items made of it (55 percent). 
  In some areas the toxic waste of power engineering 
enterprises (87 percent), heavy and agricultural machine 
building (50 percent and 32 percent respectively), machine tool 
building (20 percent), the chemical and petrochemical industry 
(23 percent), and the medical industry (20 percent) is taken to 
disposal sites for solid household waste (SHW) and to 
unauthorized dumps, although only 5 percent of the total waste 
of this category in the Russian Federation is disposed of in 
garbage dumps. 
  Household garbage is a major problem. Around 130 million 
m[.sup]3[/] of this waste is accumulated each year. At this 
time 124 million m[.sup]3[/] are sent to special disposal 
sites, and the rest of the waste is incinerated or sent to 
garbage disposal plants. The dumps and the runoff from the sewer 
system are polluting the ground water in several places, 
including 20 large areas near Pskov, Ivanovo, Smolensk, Derbent, 
Ulan-Ude, Irkutsk, Yessentuki, and other cities. 
<H6>  Section 4. Regional and Interstate Ecological Problems </H6>
<H3>  4.1. State of the Environment in Russia's Economic Regions, 
Republics, Krays, and Oblasts </H3>
  The intensive growth of Russia's industrial potential in the 
1930s, the relocation of many industrial enterprises in the 
Urals and Siberia during the war, the restoration of ravaged 
production units in the postwar period, and the accelerated 
economic development of the country in subsequent years required 
the use of colossal quantities of natural resources, which 
increased the anthropogenic pressure on the environment 
dramatically in the absence of the necessary environmental 
standards and requirements and of resource-conserving, low-waste 
technology and efficient waste treatment plants. 
  The intensive development of industry in virtually all parts 
of Russia and the creation of large industrial centers in many 
regions were accompanied by the depletion of natural resources, 
high levels of water, air, and soil pollution, and a resulting 
rise in the rate of illness. 
  Ecological conditions in the country have not changed for 
the 
better in the last few years, and in many parts of Russia they 
have grown worse. This applies not only to specific cities or 
industrial centers or specific sections of river basins or seas; 
there are major environmental problems in vast territories 
inhabited by tens of millions of people. 
  Large quantities of polluted sewage are being dumped into 
surface bodies of water and the percentage of this waste in the 
total amount of sewage is constantly rising in Russia as a whole 
and in separate republics, krays, and oblasts. There is not one 
republic, kray, or oblast where natural reservoirs have not been 
polluted by sewage. 
  The largest quantities of polluted sewage (in percentages of 
the total for the Russian Federation) are being dumped in the 
following regions: 
  Moscow Oblast--11.6* 
  Krasnodar Kray--11.6* 
  Leningrad Oblast--7.5* 
  Irkutsk Oblast--5.6* 
  Krasnoyarsk Kray--3.9* 
  Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast--3.5* 
  Samara Oblast--3.3* 
  Sverdlovsk Oblast--3.0* 
  Tatarstan Republic--3.6* 
  Kemerovo Oblast--2.8* 
  The economic activities of all production branches in 
industry contribute to this category of sewage. In Moscow and 
Leningrad Oblasts, for example, most of this sewage comes from 
municipal housing services and public utilities, in Krasnodar 
Kray it comes from agriculture, and in Irkutsk Oblast it comes 
from industry. 
  The dumping of larger quantities of polluted sewage is 
primarily the result of the inefficient performance of waste 
treatment plants because of hydraulic overloads, physical wear, 
obsolescence, and negligence. 
  The untreated sewage dumped into bodies of water does not 
meet quality standards in Vladimir, Ivanovo, Kostroma, 
Yaroslavl, Nizhniy Novgorod, Volgograd, Saratov, Sakhalin, and 
Kaliningrad oblasts, in the republics of Kalmykia, Tatarstan, 
Karelia, and Tuva, and in the Mordvinian SSR. 
  In spite of the general decline of production, the quantity 
of harmful substances released into the atmosphere has not 
decreased in the last few years. This process reflects general 
economic tendencies, and not more intense air protection efforts 
at enterprises, because the percentage of trapped and 
neutralized substances is still the same in the Russian 
Federation as a whole--77 percent. This level, however, has been 
reached in only 25 of Russia's republics, krays, and oblasts. 
  The smallest quantities of pollutants from all stationary 
sources are trapped and neutralized in Tyumen Oblast--21 
percent, Dagestan--21.5 percent, Kurgan Oblast--34.7 percent, 
Kamchatka Oblast--37.5 percent, and the Komi Republic--39 
percent. 
  The largest quantities of pollutants from stationary sources 
are emitted in Krasnoyarsk Kray (10 percent of total Russian 
emissions), Sverdlovsk and Tyumen oblasts (7.5 percent), and 
Kemerovo Oblast (4 percent). The reason is the extremely 
unsatisfactory performance, and frequently the total lack, of 
air filters and gas traps. 
  As a result, the number of cities in the Russian Federation 
with high levels of air pollution has stayed virtually the same. 
  Anthropogenic effects on the environment cannot be measured 
only by the quantity of waste released into the air and water, 
and this is the reason for the following brief description of 
the specific ecological problems of Russia's economic regions 
and the territorial administrative entities making up these 
regions. 
<H5>  Northern Economic Region </H5>
  Murmansk Oblast is the most industrialized and urbanized 
part 
of the transpolar zone. Technogenic devastation has destroyed 
ecosystems on an area of 8,100 hectares near the cities of 
Monchegorsk and Zapolyarnyy and the settlement of Nikel. Their 
restoration is thought to be impossible. Of the 515,000* tonnes 
of sulfur dioxide released into the atmosphere in 1992, 300,000 
tonnes came from the Severonikel and Pechenganikel combines. 
Besides this, 3,400 tonnes of nickel, 2,500 tonnes of copper, 
and 120 tonnes of cobalt were lost in these emissions. The 
emissions from these enterprises have damaged 126,000 hectares 
of forests, one-third of the territory of the Lapland State 
Biosphere Preserve, and the traditional habitats of small 
northern ethnic communities. Besides this, wooded areas are 
suffering from excessively high felling limits and the 
clear-cutting of pine forests. 
  The Apatit Production Association recovers only 40 percent 
of 
the raw materials used in commercial products from complex ores. 
The same association is a major polluter of surface water in the 
oblast, where 72 percent of the sewage is untreated. 
  The most serious problems in the Republic of Karelia are 
connected with the preservation of water quality in lakes Ladoga 
and Onega, the largest lakes in Europe, and the reduction of 
emissions in accordance with the Russian Federation's 
international commitments. To this end, pulp production has been 
stopped at the Lyaskelya TsBZ, located on Lake Ladoga, the 
stream driving of logs down the rivers of the Ladoga basin has 
been curtailed, and municipal sewage treatment plants are being 
built in several cities in the republic. The remodeling of the 
most ecologically hazardous production units and the 
installation of air filters and gas traps in the largest 
enterprises--the Kostomuksha Ore-Dressing Combine, responsible 
for 2.5 percent of all of the harmful emissions in the republic, 
and the Segezhabumprom joint-stock company--are being planned 
with the help of Finnish firms. 
  In Arkhangelsk Oblast, where timber felling and wood 
processing have always been highly developed, emissions from the 
pulp and paper combines in Arkhangelsk, Novodvinsk, and 
Koryazhma have produced an average concentration of methyl 
mercaptan that is 7-17 times the norm, and concentrations of 
hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide, and formaldehyde that are 
2-3 times the norm. The continued dumping of the TsBK sewage 
into bodies of water is affecting the quality and quantity of 
vegetation in water meadows and reducing the catch of salmon. 
The rate of surface water pollution is always high near the 
intakes of water supply systems in the oblast. In 1992, 81.3 
percent of the analyzed water samples did not meet chemical 
sanitary requirements and 34.4 percent did not meet 
bacteriological standards. The use of ground water is 
complicated by the presence of strontium or iron in 
concentrations exceeding allowable limits. 
  There have been outbreaks of disease in pine woods and in 
increase in forest pathogens in the last three years because of 
anthropogenic changes. Areas of algae in the White Sea are 
constantly decreasing and are showing signs of decay. Changes in 
the state of the environment have increased the mortality rate 
of Greenland seals in the first year of life. 
  The concentration of facilities of the military-industrial 
complex and the Navy near Severodvinsk, the presence of spent 
nuclear fuel in temporary storage facilities, and the existence 
of discarded reactors in the area create the danger of radiation 
pollution. The Novaya Zemlya nuclear test range and the 
radioactive waste disposal sites in the White, Barents, and Kara 
seas are also located in the oblast. Many years of tests on the 
Plesetsk range contributed to the creation of seats of pollution 
in the oblast when the booster re-entry zones were contaminated 
by liquid rocket fuel components of the first hazard category. 
Furthermore, all of this is in the North, where the 
self-cleaning properties of biological objects, particularly for 
the removal of radionuclides, are extremely slow, and this could 
have the most negative consequences. 
  It has been suggested that environmental conditions in the 
Komi Republic still hold out the possibility of the augmentation 
of industrial potential. In terms of harmful emissions, however, 
the republic ranks third not only in its own economic region 
(25.7 percent* of all emissions), but also among all 
administrative entities in the ETR. 
  Pollution levels already exceed the norm in the tributaries 
of the Pechora River--the Vorkuta, Bolshaya Inta, Kolva, Izhma, 
and Ukhta rivers--in regions of coal and oil extraction and 
refining. The republic is facing the urgent problem of saving 
the largest population of Atlantic salmon--Salmo salar--in its 
rivers, because this population could lose all of its commercial 
value by the end of the coming decade if there are no changes in 
the existing protective regulations. 
  One-fourth of the damaged lands in the republic are occupied 
by tundra forests. This could turn the area of coniferous 
forests into treeless plains. 
  Vologda Oblast ranks highest in the economic region in terms 
of harmful emissions (29.2 percent*), mainly as a result of the 
emissions of enterprises in Cherepovets--more than 500,000 
tonnes a year. The soil in a 20-km zone around the Cherepovets 
industrial center is polluted by heavy metals. The Rybinskoye 
reservoir is being affected by the Cherepovets industrial center 
and the city's household sewage. 
<H5>  North-West Economic Region </H5>
  Industrial enterprises in St. Petersburg and Leningrad 
Oblast 
are responsible for most of the environmental pollution in the 
region. They account for almost 86 percent of all emissions, and 
these are mainly sulfur dioxide and solid matter. 
  Ecological conditions in the basin of the Gulf of Finland, 
especially Neva Bay, are still disturbing. The stabilization of 
water pollution at the ``moderately polluted'' level was the 
result of reduced sewage dumping by enterprises in combination 
with the stabilization or decline of production. Sewage from the 
cities of Novgorod, Kirishi, and Volkhov have a direct effect on 
the water in Lake Ilmen, the Volkhov River, Lake Ladoga, the 
Neva River, and Neva Bay. The waste water of the Leningrad 
nuclear power plant which is discharged into Koporskaya Bay is 
affecting thermal conditions in the bay and the adjacent 
territory. 
  More than 70 percent of the pollutants in the Lake Ladoga 
basin are released by sewage from facilities in Leningrad 
Oblast. The eutrophication of the lake is affecting the supply 
of fish. 
  As a result of water pollution, the sources of water for 
fish 
hatcheries in the oblast do not meet the requirements for 
hatcheries, and this results in losses of fish or the total 
depletion of fish stocks there. 
  The pollution of ground water on the Karelian isthmus has 
resulted in a lead content exceeding the MAC by 1.5-3 times in 
80 water intakes. 
  The constant overfelling of timber of the first and second 
quality categories, combined with the underfelling of timber in 
general, will have a negative effect on the state of wooded 
areas. The only native blue spruce forest is on the verge of 
destruction. 
  Radiation conditions in the oblast depend on the Leningrad 
AES. The Krasnyy Bor disposal site for highly toxic waste is a 
problem, because it was filled to capacity long ago, but the 
burial of waste there has continued. 
<H5>  Central Economic Region </H5>
  The Central Economic Region is distinguished by a high 
concentration of industrial potential and high population 
density. 
  The ecological situation in Moscow Oblast is disturbing. 
More 
than 3,200 industrial enterprises, poultry factories, and animal 
husbandry complexes and a diversified transport network have 
created levels of air, soil, and surface and ground water 
pollution that are always in excess of the norm. Around 55 
million tonnes of waste products (of which only 15 million 
tonnes are recycled) are produced each year in the Moscow 
region, including 14 million tonnes of waste from poultry 
farming and livestock breeding. The continuous reduction of 
wooded areas in the oblast is accompanied by the colossal 
pressure on these woods as the main recreational site of the 
region's population of over 16 million. 
  Moscow and the oblast are responsible for 25.2 percent* of 
the atmospheric emissions in the Central Economic Region. Water 
resources in the oblast are only one-fiftieth of the average 
supply in the Russian Federation. Territories reserved for 
landscaping are being reduced in the capital, and the 
self-restorative properties of natural resources have been 
exhausted. 
  The main sources of air pollution in Smolensk Oblast are 
industrial enterprises and public utilities, which are located 
in its central section--Smolensk, Yartsevo, Dorogobuzh, and 
other cities. Their sewage is responsible for much of the 
pollution in the Dnieper River in the oblast. The amount of 
polluted sewage dumped into this river basin in 1992 was 141 
million m[.sup]3[/]. The amount of water removed from natural 
sources in the oblast for the Moscow municipal water supply 
increased substantially in 1992. The enterprises of the 
Smolenskenergo Production Association are responsible for 68.5 
percent of the emissions in the oblast, and the Minudobreniya 
Production Association in Dorogobuzh is responsible for 6.1 
percent. 
  One of the unsolved problems with statewide implications is 
the radioactive pollution of several oblasts in the country, 
particularly Bryansk Oblast, as a result of the accident at the 
Chernobyl AES. This is discussed in detail in section 1.9. Some 
of the cities in the oblast's southwestern rayons, the ones most 
heavily polluted by radionuclides, either have no waste 
treatment plants or have plants that are overloaded. In 1992 
there were 933 recorded forest fires (as compared to 191 in 
1991), and these could cause the dispersion of the 
radionuclides. Enterprises of the construction industry in 
Fokino release one-fourth of all of the pollutants in the oblast. 
  Despite relatively low emission and dumping indicators, the 
surface and ground water is polluted in Orel Oblast, 
particularly by petroleum products in Orlovskiy Rayon. More than 
60 percent of the farmland is threatened by erosion. 
  Ryazan Oblast is having a severe effect on the Oka River 
basin. All of the large tributaries of the Oka have average 
levels of pollution, but the levels are extremely high in many 
small streams. Furthermore, the dumping of polluted sewage 
increased by more than 5 percent in 1992 in comparison with the 
previous year and amounted to 71 million m[.sup]3[/]. The 
construction of waste treatment plants is a major problem. 
  Only 50 percent of the timber supply is used in the oblast. 
The soil is suffering from the reduction of humus. Some parts of 
Kasimovskiy Rayon have turned into a wasteland. 
  Immediate measures to improve the state of the environment 
are essential in Tula Oblast in the environs of Tula, 
Novomoskovsk, and Yefremov, where many branches of industry are 
highly developed. The oblast ranks second in the region in terms 
of atmospheric emissions (21.2 percent*), and second in Russia 
in terms of the anthropogenic stress on the territory. 
  The preservation of state memorial and natural preserves 
should be the object of special concern in the oblast: the 
museum-farmsteads of L.N. Tolstoy (``Yasnaya Polyana'') and V.D. 
Polenov. With a view to these factors and others, at the end of 
1992 the Russian Federation Government passed a decree ``On the 
Experiment in Tula Oblast in Perfecting the Economic, 
Organizational, and Legal Methods and Mechanisms of the 
Restoration of Its Territory and the Protection of Public 
Health.'' 
  The levels of water and air pollution in Kostroma Oblast are 
relatively low (except in the locations of large enterprises and 
power engineering facilities). The most difficult problems are 
connected with the felling and processing of timber. The 
practice of clear-cutting must stop. The waste products of 
logging and woodworking operations (amounting to 5.5 million 
m[.sup]3[/] a year in this oblast) must be used, and 
submerged logs (estimated at 2.5 million m[.sup]3[/] in the 
oblast) must be removed from rivers where stream driving has 
been practiced. 
  One of the main ecological problems in Yaroslavl Oblast is 
connected with changes in the supply of surface and ground water 
under the influence of the Gorkovskoye, Rybinskoye, and 
Uglichskoye reservoirs: Farmland is being flooded, and changes 
in geological conditions have been recorded in Yaroslavl, 
Rybinsk, and other cities in the oblast, requiring the costly 
retrofitting of buildings and installations. The geochemistry of 
the soil cover is changing, zones of stagnation have been found 
in the tributaries of the Volga River, and the erosion of its 
banks is continuing. 
  Problems connected with waste, particularly industrial 
waste, 
are among the primary concerns in Ivanovo Oblast. Around 10.5 
million tonnes of waste ash and cinder have accumulated in just 
three large electric power plants in Ivanovo, and 600,000 tonnes 
of calcium sulfide have accumulated on the grounds of the 
Dmitriyev Chemical Plant. The oblast's cities in the cis-Volga 
zone (Kineshma, Puchezh, Yuryevets, and Navoloki) have no 
municipal waste treatment plants. Highly toxic sewage is being 
released into the Volga by the Trans-Volga Chemical Plant imeni 
Frunze. Enterprises in Ivanovo are responsible for 45 percent of 
the atmospheric emissions. Regular felling in excess of the 
limit is severely depleting timber resources. 
  In Vladimir Oblast, the water table in Kovrov is severely 
polluted by chromium salts. Wildlife populations have been 
reduced dramatically by hunters. 
<H5>  Volga-Vyatka Economic Region </H5>
  Most of the air pollution in the region is the result of 
emissions from enterprises in Nizhniy Novgorod (51.9 percent*) 
and Kirov (25.1 percent*) oblasts. More than half of the 
emissions in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast come from enterprises in 
Nizhniy Novgorod and Dzerzhinsk. Territories located on the 
shores of the Cheboksary Reservoir are threatened by its rising 
water level. As a result of the pollution of the reservoir, the 
only source of water for the centralized supply network in 
Cheboksary, this water does not meet the requirements of 
standard indicators for the chemical and biological consumption 
of oxygen, ammonium nitrate, and formaldehyde. The pollutants in 
the water are polluting the fish, in which the content of 
organomercuric compounds is 2-5 times the MAC. 
  Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast is responsible for almost 
two-thirds* 
of the polluted sewage dumped in the economic region. 
  In Kirov Oblast the rivers are polluted by phenols (up to 7 
times the MAC), petroleum products (up to 20 times the MAC), 
copper (9 times the MAC), and zinc (4 times the MAC). The water 
in the Vyatka River does not meet the requirements of sources of 
drinking water. Logs are still being stream driven down the 
rivers. 
<H5>  Cis-Volga Economic Region </H5>
  Industry and agriculture in the cis-Volga region have the 
dubious distinction of being responsible for most of the 
pollution of the Volga River. The total quantity of runoff and 
polluted sewage here is twice the amount in the Volga-Vyatka 
region. Most of the emissions in the region come from 
enterprises in Samara Oblast (36 percent*) and the Tatarstan 
Republic (24 percent). Sulfur dioxide is the most common 
pollutant. 
  The cis-Volga region is the site of the most intense 
shrinking of forests. In Penza Oblast the excessive felling 
limits of past years affected the density of stands, the average 
supply of timber, and the quality of reforested areas. 
  Saratov Oblast is distinguished by a high level of plowed 
farmland (77 percent), and 85 percent of this land is prone to 
deflation. The regional rise in the level of surface and ground 
water as a result of new reservoirs and irrigation systems has 
caused the waterlogging, flooding, and salinization of the soil. 
Oak woods are shrinking everywhere. The steppe areas that were 
once so rich in a variety of grasses have disappeared completely. 
  Large industrial centers in Saratov, Engels, Balakovo, 
Volsk, 
and other cities create high levels of air pollution. Of the 
250,000* tonnes of emissions in the oblast, 107,000* are 
released in Saratov, and 45,000* are released in Balakovo. More 
than half of all of these emissions are specific substances. 
Sewage treatment plants are inefficient or nonexistent in some 
cities. The pollution of the Saratov and Volgograd reservoirs 
has led to the appearance of heavy metal residue in fish. The 
oblast has sources of radiation hazards--the Balakovskaya AES, 
the territorial radioactive waste disposal site of the Radon SK 
in Tatishchevskiy Rayon, the industrial beryllium waste disposal 
sites in Saratovskiy Rayon, and others. 
  The presence of toxic substance storage facilities, a 
military installation with a chemical weapons test site, which 
was in operation for almost 70 years, and the Institute of 
Organic Synthesis Technologies with an experimental plant, which 
has been working with toxic substances for more than 30 years, 
creates particularly serious problems in the oblast. 
  Samara Oblast leads the economic region in atmospheric 
emissions and sewage dumping. The air in Novokubyshevsk, Samara, 
and Tolyatti is polluted by specific and more common substances 
in concentrations exceeding 10 times the MAC. The water in the 
Saratov Reservoir below these cities is severely polluted. A 
distinctive feature of the soil pollution here is the large 
quantity of petroleum products in the zones of oil production 
and transport. The damaged soils on agricultural land polluted 
by oil are suffering from salinization and alkalization. The 
grounds of vacation homes and vegetable gardens in Tolyatti and 
Samara are polluted by heavy metals. 
  The operations of the Chapayevsk Chemical Fertilizer Plant 
have polluted the soil, water, and air with dioxins. 
  Around 65 sites of ground water pollution have been 
discovered here on the grounds of large industrial enterprises 
and agricultural facilities, and around 40 are near currently 
operating water supply networks. 
  The reduction of the natural fertility of the land and the 
degradation of the soil by erosion, salinization, and 
technogenic stress have been recorded everywhere in the Republic 
of Kalmykia. The high water table, leaks in the main channels of 
irrigation systems, and the absence of storm drains flooded 49 
populated communities. In spite of this, there is still an acute 
shortage of drinking water. 
  Up to a million tonnes of salts are released into Lake 
Manych-Gudi with the highly mineralized and untreated sewage of 
reclamation systems in neighboring oblasts. The runoff from rice 
paddies in Astrakhan Oblast flooded meadows in the floodplain 
and caused Lake Sarpa to overflow its banks. 
  The situation around Chernyye Zemli is out of control. 
Several communities and several hundred animal husbandry farms 
either disappeared or were buried in the sand in the past 25 
years as a result of desertification. 
  Radiation conditions in abandoned uranium-phosphorus mines 
are being assessed so that plans can be drawn up for their 
restoration. 
  The preservation of the saiga population in Kalmykia is a 
major problem in the republic. 
<H5>  Central-Chernozem Economic Region </H5>
  The conservation and restoration of chernozem soils is a 
serious problem throughout the economic region. In Voronezh 
Oblast they represent 80 percent of the plowed land, but the 
soil there has lost more than a third of its humus reserves, and 
the humus content is below the norm on half of the area. 
Voronezh Oblast leads the region in fresh water extraction and 
in sewage dumping, including the dumping of polluted sewage. 
  This economic region and the Ural region are the leaders in 
chlorine emissions. Enterprises in Lipetsk and Belgorod oblasts 
are responsible for more than 75 percent* of all emissions in 
the region (60.6 percent* and 15.4 percent* respectively). 
Lipetsk ranks fifth among the nation's cities with the highest 
emission levels. The sewage discharged from treatment facilities 
at the Novolipetsk Metallurgical Combine and from slurry pits 
and enterprises in Lipetsk into the Voronezh River represents 97 
percent of all the polluted sewage in the oblast. 
  There is a chronic shortage of surface and ground water in 
Kursk Oblast. There is no waste purification equipment 
whatsoever in 19 of the oblast's cities and settlements. The 
future of the internationally acclaimed Central-Chernozem 
Preserve imeni Professor V.V. Alekhin is being jeopardized by 
intensive farming. 
  The cities of Belgorod, Shebekino, and Staryy Oskol are 
serious problems in Belgorod Oblast. The enterprises in these 
cities are major sources of air pollution and surface and ground 
water pollution. Ethers, aldehydes, alcohol, acids, and other 
elements commonly found in the emissions from a chemical plant 
were present in the air of residential neighborhoods in 
Shebekino in 1992 in quantities 3-5 times the MAC. The sulfates 
in the sewage this enterprise discharges into leach fields have 
polluted the water table. 
  All of the chemicals stored in tanks on the grounds of the 
Pigment Production Association, particularly the phosgene, 
constitute an environmental hazard in Tambov Oblast. 
<H5>  North Caucasus Economic Region </H5>
  The tendency toward changes in the composition of the soil 
is 
particularly disturbing in Stavropol Kray. Around 5.2 million 
hectares, or 84 percent of the total area, have been damaged by 
water and wind erosion. Erosion of all types has destroyed 26.6 
percent of the plowed fields, 42 percent of the pastures, and 39 
percent of the area of hayfields. Gullies and gorges are growing 
and already occupy around 23,000 hectares. Reclamation projects 
will be necessary to save 292,000 hectares of plowed fields 
suffering from varying degrees of salinity and 30,000 hectares 
of arable land with alkaline soils. More than 600,000 hectares 
are submerged and require immediate drainage. The water table is 
too high in 220 populated communities. 
  Sites of radioactive pollution by pipelines and geothermal 
equipment that were once in use, building materials from 
quarries with a high radionuclide content, and the activities of 
the Almaz Production Association were discovered recently. 
  The state of the country's oldest resort zone--the mineral 
springs of the Caucasus--is cause for concern. 
  Krasnodar Kray is another of Russia's important resort 
regions. The republic's acclaimed sanatoriums, serving the 
public's need for relaxation and therapeutic treatment, are 
located on the Black Sea coast in Tuapse, Anapa, Sochi, and 
Novorossiysk. The enterprises and sewer systems in these cities, 
however, discharge considerable quantities of polluted sewage 
and runoff (from rice paddies) into the Black and Azov seas and 
the Kuban River each year. In 1992, for example, around 90 
million* m[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage was discharged by the 
municipal sewer system in Sochi. The city's beaches were closed 
several times because the sea was severely polluted. The air in 
the resort cities is polluted by the emissions of industrial 
enterprises and motor vehicles. In 1992 the cement enterprises 
in Novorossiysk discharged more than 30 percent of all the dust 
entering the atmosphere in Krasnodar Kray. The kray leads the 
country in vehicle emissions. 
  The Krasnodarskoye Reservoir has a significant impact on 
ecological conditions in Krasnodar Kray and the Adyge Republic. 
Settlements in three of the republic's seven rayons are flooded 
when the water level is kept too high and when water is pumped 
to the rice paddies in Krasnodar Kray. 
  The absence of a centralized water supply compounds the 
danger of the rising water table, because this pollutes sources 
of drinking water. At this time the water in the Krasnodarskoye 
Reservoir does not meet some of the main requirements for a 
fishery, but there are no other bodies of water for this purpose. 
  Rostov Oblast is one of the most highly polluted areas of 
the 
North Caucasus region. Pollutants emitted by industrial 
enterprises in the oblast amounted to 500,000* tonnes in 1992, 
or more than 40 percent* of all the emissions in the economic 
region. Most of the pollutants are discharged by enterprises of 
the fuel and energy complex and the metallurgical industry in 
Novocherkassk, Rostov-on-Don, Volgodonsk, Taganrog, and Shakhty. 
The air is also polluted by 230 waste heaps and the dumps 
surrounding coal mines in the oblast, more than 50 of which are 
smoldering. Around 200 m[.sup]3[/] of extracted rocks have 
accumulated here, and over 7 million m[.sup]3[/] are added 
each year. Water quality and sanitary conditions in the Don 
River and its tributaries in Rostov Oblast all the way down to 
the estuary, including the Tsimlyanskoye Reservoir, are 
influenced by pollutants carried from the upper reaches, from 
the territory of Ukraine, by the polluted sewage discharged by 
enterprises in the oblast, and by mineral fertilizers, 
pesticides, and other pollutants flushed into bodies of water 
from agricultural land and animal husbandry facilities. 
<H5>  Ural Economic Region </H5>
  The Ural Economic Region leads the country in gross 
emissions 
of harmful substances and of solid matter, carbon monoxide, 
nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, lead, chlorine, formaldehyde, and 
xylene. The region ranks second in the country in emissions of 
sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid, fluoric compounds, hydrogen 
sulfide, ammonia, hydrogen chloride, and phenols. 
  The largest share of total emissions is contributed by 
enterprises in Sverdlovsk Oblast (30 percent*) and Chelyabinsk 
Oblast (27 percent*). 
  Most of the territory is suffering from a water shortage. 
  Accidents at the Mayak Production Association and the 
release 
of sewage into the open drain made up of the Techa-Iset-Tobol 
river system polluted Chelyabinsk Oblast, where the production 
association is located, and Sverdlovsk and Kurgan oblasts with 
radionuclides. The high concentration of solid and liquid 
radioactive waste on the grounds of the combine is a threat to 
the environment and the population. 
  In Sverdlovsk Oblast the areas polluted by radionuclides, 
other than the East Ural radioactive track, are the settlement 
of Ozernyy in Rzhevskiy Rayon and adjacent territories, the area 
surrounding the Krasnoufimsk branch of the Pobeda Combine, and 
the Olkhov marsh near the Beloyarskaya AES. 
  The level of soil pollution by heavy metals near enterprises 
of the extractive industry and of ferrous and nonferrous 
metallurgy is from 50 to 200 times the MAC. 
  Enterprises in the watershed area of Sverdlovsk Oblast 
pollute the rivers of the Ob and Volga basins with sewage 
containing high concentrations of heavy metals. The reduction of 
timber resources in the oblast is perceptible, and the area of 
game preserves was once 1.8 times the present area. 
  Kurgan Oblast is distinguished by a limited water supply and 
a high rate of pollution in sources of water. The per capita 
supply is only half the average for the economic region. The 
water in the Iset and Miass rivers cannot be used for household 
needs, and the Tobol River is polluted by petroleum products, 
manganese, ammonium nitrate, and copper (average annual 
concentrations are 24 times the MAC in some areas). The water in 
all of the 106 small rivers is unfit for consumption. 
  The concentration of large industrial facilities in Ufa, 
Sterlitamak, Salavat, Meleuz, and other cities is the reason for 
the unsatisfactory environmental conditions in the Bashkortostan 
Republic. The negative effects of air pollution are compounded 
by lengthy periods of bad weather (up to 203 storm warnings a 
year). Dioxins were found recently in the air and water, and 
especially the soil, in Ufa and its environs. 
  The large quantities of water taken out of some sections of 
the Belaya River basin when the water level is low are the cause 
of a perceptible negative water balance. The stream-driving of 
logs has continued in several of the republic's rivers. 
  The development plans of earlier years for the Udmurt 
Republic focused on the establishment of a strong industrial 
complex. Defense industry enterprises constitute around 70 
percent of this complex. Military conversion and the dramatic 
reduction of defense requisitions led to a situation in which 
oil and timber are the main sources of republic budget income. 
Intensive oil production aggravated ecological problems 
perceptibly: There were 755 recorded accidents on pipelines in 
1992, and the ground water in Igrinskiy Rayon was polluted by 
petroleum products. Timber felling is reducing the supply of 
mature timber (which had already decreased to only 28 percent of 
the total) and the proportional number of coniferous trees in 
republic forests. Protected natural territories occupy 3 
percent* of republic territory. 
  Large quantities of chemical weapons (mustard gas and 
organophosphoric chemical warfare agents) have accumulated in 
Udmurtia, and their elimination will entail difficulties. 
  Territories bordering on the Tatarstan Republic are 
suffering 
from the trans-border drift of emissions from industrial 
complexes in Mendeleyev, Yelabuga, Naberezhnyye Chelny, and 
Nizhnekamsk. 
  There has been a rise in the rate of infectious 
diseases--hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and tick-borne 
encephalitis. 
<H5>  West Siberian Economic Region </H5>
  This region ranks second among the country's economic 
regions 
in total emissions of harmful substances and in emissions of 
solid matter, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides, and it ranks 
highest in phenol emissions. The largest share of the region's 
total emissions is contributed by enterprises in Tyumen Oblast 
(46.1 percent*) and Kemerovo Oblast (22.6 percent*). 
  Tyumen Oblast is the main region of oil and gas production 
in 
Russia and, consequently, one of the main sources of Russian 
export potential. State capital investments in the Tyumen oil 
and gas complex were cut substantially in the last few years, 
but they are still colossal (in comparison with other regions). 
Measures to protect the environment in the zone of this complex, 
however, have been ineffective and have not kept up with the 
growth of technogenic influences on natural biological 
resources, and this has created a critical ecological situation 
in this territory. The inefficient use of water resources, the 
high rate of accidents in oil fields and pipelines, and the 
dumping of polluted sewage (in excess of 120 million 
m[.sup]3[/]) are still inflicting considerable damage on 
bodies of water. The water is also being polluted by oil from 
several drilling rigs and around 10,000 containers of drilling 
fluid. The average concentrations of petroleum products in the 
northern part of the Ob inlet in recent years have exceeded the 
limit by 10 times on the surface and approximately 20 times on 
the river bed. This is an indication of chronic pollution and 
the repression of self-cleansing properties. 
  In the Ob Pond Fishery, a world-class acclimatization 
reserve 
and a sanctuary for the genetic stock of sturgeon, salmon, and 
lake whitefish, 25 of the valuable streams are totally unfit for 
use as hatcheries, and around 20 have lost part of their value. 
When ecological requirements were ignored during the 
exploitation of oil and gas deposits in the 30 years the Tyumen 
area of the North was being developed, the area of reindeer 
grazing lands decreased by 12-15 percent, the catch of fish was 
reduced by half, and fires destroyed around 1.3 million hectares 
of reindeer pastures and hunting grounds. The significance of 
domestic reindeer breeding and fishing as the mainstays of the 
native lifestyle in the region is constantly being diminished. 
  The fragile northern environment of the Yamal Peninsula has 
almost no protection against anthropogenic influences. 
Construction projects and the exploitation of mineral deposits 
are changing natural habitats, increasing stress, and reducing 
the number of animals and the variety of animal species. This is 
particularly true of rare species requiring protection. There 
are many such species in the Tyumen north. The zone of the 
Bovanenkovskoye deposit and adjacent territories alone are the 
habitat of 11 species of mammals and over 50 species of birds, 
including the endangered peregrine falcon, pygmy swan, 
red-breasted goose, and polar bear, as well as the large birds 
of prey and owls playing an important role in the tundra 
biocenosis. 
  The main sources of environmental pollution in Omsk and 
Novosibirsk oblasts and in Altay Kray are enterprises in the 
oblast centers, in Barnaul, and in several other cities, many of 
which are enterprises of the defense complex. Emissions of 
harmful substances in Omsk alone amounted to 404,400* tonnes in 
1992 (93 percent* of all emissions in the oblast), with 
respective figures of 162,100* (or 51 percent*) for Novosibirsk 
and 140,300* (or 41 percent*) for Barnaul. 
  Forests cover 35 percent* of the territory of Tyumen Oblast, 
and more than half are coniferous forests, including dwarf 
pines, and the unique fir woods of the taiga. This colossal 
resource potential, however, is not being used efficiently. 
Whereas 11.3 million* m[.sup]3[/] of timber (approximately a 
third of the felling limit) is cut down in a year in the oblast 
as a whole, systematic clearing in certain areas has reduced the 
number of trees in some woods to 20 percent or less of the 
previous number. Protected forests and stands of trees along 
rivers are being cut down. Each year more than 8 million 
m[.sup]3[/] of timber burns in forest fires. 
  On instructions from the Russian Federation Government, the 
Russian Ministry of Ecology conducted an expert appraisal of the 
ecological situation in the Kuzbass in 1992. The appraisal 
commission concluded that the Kuzbass qualified as an ecological 
disaster zone. It met the necessary ecological criteria and the 
criteria of public health in large industrial centers. 
  The sources of pollution in the cities of Kemerovo Oblast 
(Kemerovo, Novokuznetsk, Leninsk-Kuznetskiy, Prokopyevsk, 
Kiselevsk, Anzhero-Sudzhensk, and others) are more than 900 
industrial facilities, coal mining and transport enterprises, 
waste transport and management enterprises, and motor vehicles. 
More than 100 different harmful substances enter the atmosphere 
from stationary and mobile sources of emissions. The degradation 
and pollution of the soil cover are gathering momentum in large 
parts of the region. The soil in the 10-km zone around 
Novokuznetsk, for example, contains cadmium in 6 times the MAC, 
zinc in 5 times the MAC, copper and nickel in 2-3 times the MAC, 
and fluorine in 6-8 times the MAC. The most serious and 
irreversible changes in the geological environment in the 
Kuzbass include the technogenic damage connected with mineral 
extraction. Each year 1,500 hectares of tillable and plowed land 
is appropriated for open-cast coal mining and is not returned to 
agriculture for a long time. The use of waste products is not 
keeping up with the rate of their accumulation. Only 15 percent 
of the recovered stripping rock is used, and the waste products 
of other areas of production are never used at all. Water 
quality in the Tom River declines perceptibly downstream from 
the Moskovsk-Mezhdurechensk industrial center and the pollutants 
in the water are several times in excess of the allowable limit. 
<H5>  East Siberian Economic Region </H5>
  The East Siberian Economic Region is the leader in sulfur 
dioxide, sulfuric acid, fluoric compounds, and benzpyrene 
emissions. The main sources of these emissions are located in 
Krasnoyarsk Kray (66.3 percent*) and Irkutsk Oblast (21.2 
percent*). 
  A critical ecological situation demanding immediate action 
has developed around Norilsk in Krasnoyarsk Kray. This area is 
distinguished by extreme vulnerability to all types of 
anthropogenic influences and the slow self-cleaning and 
self-restoration of natural resources. 
  The main polluter of the city's environment is the Norilsk 
Mining and Metallurgical Combine, which releases over 2 million* 
tonnes of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. This is the 
largest quantity discharged by any city in Russia. The sulfur 
dioxide emissions are killing trees. All of the trees are dead 
in wooded areas covering 180,000 hectares. The polluted sewage 
the combine dumps in the Shchuchya, Ambarnaya, Norilskaya river 
basins has cost them their value as fish spawning grounds. The 
presence of heavy metals has been recorded in water and plants. 
Accumulated toxic waste occupies an area of around 2,000 
hectares. 
  The ecological situation is also growing worse in other 
industrial centers of Krasnoyarsk Kray: Krasnoyarsk, Kansk, and 
Achinsk. 
  The strongest anthropogenic pressure on the environment in 
Irkutsk Oblast is exerted by enterprises located in the oblast 
center and some industrial centers--Angarsk, Bratsk, Zima, 
Usolye-Sibirsk, and Shelekhov (all of them are on the list of 
Russian cities with the highest levels of air pollution in 
1992). The enterprises in the Baykal basin warrant special 
attention because they are having a direct effect on the lake 
ecosystem. 
  A large part of the Republic of Buryatia is located in the 
Lake Baykal basin on heavily forested territory. This sets the 
main guidelines of ecological policy and adds special importance 
to water and forest conservation. The largest quantities of 
pollutants enter the Selenga River from the Ulan-Ude industrial 
center. Nitrites, petroleum products, hexavalent chromium, and 
ferric ions have been found in its water in concentrations 
exceeding the limit by 3-14 times. Other sources of water 
pollution in the Lake Baykal basin are enterprises of the 
construction complex, gold mining, and surface runoff from 
ports, logging organizations, and oil terminals. Severobaykalsk, 
located on the shore of Lake Baykal, is a danger to the lake's 
ecosystem. The environmental pollution here is comprehensive: 
The central sewer system serves only part of the city, waste 
treatment facilities are overloaded, some sewage is dumped into 
natural depressions in the landscape, and there are no storm 
drains. 
  The unfavorable conditions of the dispersion of pollutants, 
particularly from low sources, are also characteristic of Chita 
Oblast and contribute to the high levels of air pollution in its 
cities and industrial settlements. The pollution of the Khilok 
and Chikoy rivers, which are part of the Baykal Conservation 
Zone, soil erosion, and forest fires are major concerns in the 
oblast. 
<H5>  Far Eastern Economic Region </H5>
  Problems in water use and the use of land and forest 
resources are the most urgent and virtually universal concerns 
in this region. 
  Solid matter, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide are the 
most common pollutants in the emissions of stationary sources. 
The major contributors to these emissions are enterprises in 
Maritime Kray (25.8 percent*), Khabarovsk Kray (22.9 percent*), 
and Magadan Oblast (13.8 percent*). 
  The Sakha Republic (Yakutia) is one of the richest regions 
in 
the country in commercial mineral reserves, including some 
unique minerals. The republic is the source of raw materials for 
the production of many metals (zinc, iridium, tin, gold, and 
platinum), as well as diamonds, coal, natural gas, and gas 
condensate. The continued incomplete use of commercial minerals, 
resulting in the unwarranted growth of extraction volumes, the 
premature cessation of work on deposits, and the accumulation of 
waste, is a problem throughout Russia. 
  Yakutia, like other Siberian territories, is in need of a 
radically improved system of forest fire protection. In 1992 
there were 1,040* recorded fires in the republic on an area 
encompassing 215,000* hectares of forests--several times larger 
than the annual felling area. 
  The dumping of sewage, including polluted sewage, has 
increased in Amur Oblast. The main polluters are open-cut coal 
mines, gold mining enterprises, railway transport, and public 
utilities. Surface water in the environs of placer mines using 
amalgamation processes for gold mining contain excessive 
concentrations of heavy metals, including mercury. 
  Around 50 percent of the agricultural land in the oblast, 
the 
main agricultural region in the Far East, is marshy, 
waterlogged, and highly acidic. 
  The forests, the oblast's most valuable resource, are 
subject 
to regular fires covering large areas and to the effects of 
pests and diseases. The total area of protected territories is 
small--0.5 percent of oblast territory. 
  In Khabarovsk Kray, levels of air pollution are high in 
Amursk, Komsomolsk-on-Amur, and Khabarovsk. The mining industry 
here is distinguished by considerable damage to the landscape. 
Over 40 percent of the timber in the economic region is cut in 
Khabarovsk Kray. In Maritime Kray a critical ecological 
situation has developed around the Rudnaya River. High levels of 
heavy metals, boron, and sulfur have been found in the water of 
that river and in the air in Dalnegorsk, Rudnaya Pristan, and 
adjacent territories. Lake Khanka is polluted by pesticides from 
rice paddies. 
  The fish resources in the seas off the east coast of Russia 
play a significant role in the economy of Maritime Kray, 
Kamchatka, Magadan, and Sakhalin oblasts, and Russia as a whole, 
and this attaches special importance to the protection of 
surface water and the seas. Most of the rivers of the Sakhalin, 
Kuril, and Kamchatka areas are spawning grounds for salmon, but 
half of the rivers in Sakhalin Oblast are exposed to constant 
pollution as a result of economic activity. In all, around 150 
million* m[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage is discharged into 
bodies of water in the oblast, including 100 million 
m[.sup]3[/] from seven pulp and paper plants. The sewage in 
Kamchatka Oblast (50 million m[.sup]3[/] of which was 
polluted in 1992) is dumped primarily into fish ponds of the 
first and second categories. In Magadan, 80 percent of the 
municipal sewage is dumped untreated into the Sea of Okhotsk. 
Petr Velikiy Bay, the most polluted part of the Sea of Japan, 
serves as the receptacle for 400 million m[.sup]3[/] of 
sewage each year, including 90 million untreated m[.sup]3[/]. 
Fish resources suffer colossal damage from the activities of 
timber industry enterprises practicing intensive cutting, 
sometimes even in the upper reaches of rivers used as spawning 
grounds, and enterprises of the agroindustrial complex. On 
Sakhalin Island they are also threatened by the many geological 
prospecting, coal, and oil enterprises. 
<H5>  Kaliningrad Oblast </H5>
  Ecological conditions in the oblast are affected by the 
activity of enterprises of the pulp and paper industry, wood 
processing, machine building, metalworking, and thermal power 
engineering. They are responsible for 71 percent of the harmful 
emissions. The most common are sulfur dioxide emissions. 
  The sewage of enterprises and public utilities is affecting 
the quality of surface water and the adjacent expanses of the 
Baltic Sea by causing the asphyxiation of aquatic animals in the 
Pregolya River and some parts of Kursk Gulf. 
<H3>  4.2. State of Large Regions with Unsatisfactory Ecological 
Conditions </H3>
  The anthropogenic influences in several regions of the 
Russian Federation exceeded allowable limits and ecological 
restrictions long ago, thereby creating a critical situation in 
which the landscape is being changed in significant and almost 
irreparable ways, the danger of the depletion or loss of natural 
resources and unique natural objects is rapidly mounting, and 
the living conditions of the population are deteriorating 
perceptibly. 
  The regions within the territory of Russia include the 
Azov-Black Sea zone, the North Caspian region, Kalmykia, the 
central cis-Volga and cis-Kama zone, the Kola Peninsula, the 
Urals, the Kuzbass, the basins of Lake Baykal and the Angara 
River, and some others. 
  These regions are distinguished by a complex group of 
ecological problems, caused primarily by the polluting influence 
of large industrial centers and by the intensive use of natural 
resources (recreation, mining, and agriculture). These adverse 
influences are usually compounded in most of the areas by high 
population density. 
  The high concentration of production units and high 
population density in these regions, combined with the remainder 
principle of environmental project funding, has led to the 
dramatic deterioration of ecological conditions because the 
ecological capacity of natural complexes has either been 
exhausted or is close to this state. 
  The use of increasing quantities of water and the failure to 
recycle water, the increase in hydraulic engineering 
construction projects, the larger quantities of polluted sewage 
discharged into rivers and ponds, and the contamination of 
bodies of water with fertilizers and toxic chemicals from 
agricultural fields and the polluted runoff from urbanized areas 
have had a severely adverse effect on the state of the Volga, 
Kama, Oka, Kuban, and Angara rivers and other bodies of water, 
and in some regions they have led to serious problems in 
supplying the population with potable water. 
  The unique natural recreational areas of the Russian 
coastline and waters of the Black and Azov seas, which have 
experienced excessive anthropogenic pressure for a long time, 
have lost much of their resource potential, and this, in turn, 
could have grave interstate ecological and social consequences. 
  The ecological problems in the industrial zones of the Kola 
Peninsula were caused largely by the vulnerability of the 
landscape to technogenic influences and its weak self-cleaning 
capacity. Furthermore, the zone of ecological problems is 
constantly growing. The main problems on the Kola Peninsula are 
environmental pollution, the destruction of land, and the 
degradation of regional flora and fauna. 
  The main ecological problem in Kalmykia is the depletion or 
loss of natural resources (water, land, and biological 
resources). The exacerbation of water problems and deterioration 
of agricultural product quality in these regions are 
jeopardizing public health. In addition to this, the degradation 
of pastures as a result of excessive and disorganized livestock 
grazing is a major ecological problem in Kalmykia, where the 
land is highly vulnerable to anthropogenic influences (the 
salinity of soils, their weak mechanical composition, and so 
forth). This has intensified soil erosion and deflation and the 
general aridization of the territory. 
  The North Caspian region is suffering from serious 
ecological 
and public health problems, primarily in connection with the 
construction and operation of the Astrakhan gas complex. The 
main reasons are the low technical and organizational standards 
of the operation of the first section of this complex. This has 
created such problems as air and water pollution, the reduction 
of fish resources, and the deterioration of the natural state of 
the Volga-Akhtyubinsk floodplain. All of this has resulted in a 
higher rate of illness, and primarily among children. 
  In the central cis-Volga and cis-Kama region, the Kuzbass, 
the industrial zone of the Urals, the cities on the banks of the 
Angara River, and the Lake Baykal region, the effects of the 
oil, mining, chemical, pulp and paper, and heavy industries and 
enterprises of power engineering, intensive agriculture, and 
inadequate environmental protection efforts exacerbated 
ecological problems in the form of pollution, the destruction of 
land and disruption of natural processes in territories under 
special protection, and the degradation of regional flora and 
fauna. The ecological problems here have also been accompanied 
by changes in public health indicators. 
<H5>  4.3. Interstate Ecological Problems </H5>
  The Russian Federation has ecological problems in common 
with 
more than 20 countries because of common maritime or land 
borders and common interests in several border regions. 
  Within the framework of the cooperation by CIS states, these 
problems will be solved according to the terms of the 
multilateral agreement of 8 February 1992 and the bilateral 
intergovernmental agreements that are being drafted at this time. 
  The implementation of the agreement on interaction in the 
ecological sphere and in environmental protection of 8 February 
1992 will require concerted effort by the member-states, and 
must be reflected in an RF program for the fulfillment of agreed 
commitments in the following areas: 
  -- the coordination of environmental legislative instruments 
and ecological standards and requirements; 
  -- the joint drafting and implementation of interstate 
programs and plans in the sphere of resource use, including 
programs for the safe elimination and neutralization of chemical 
and nuclear weapons and highly toxic and radioactive waste; 
  -- the use of common approaches, criteria, methods, and 
procedures in evaluating the quality and monitoring the state of 
the environment and anthropogenic effects on the environment, 
and the guarantee of the comparability of data on the state of 
the environment on the interstate and international levels; 
  -- the use of agreed methods to assess the environmental 
impact of economic and other activity; 
  -- the standardization of methods of limiting the 
anthropogenic impact on the environment; 
  -- the use of agreed methods to monitor genetic changes in 
communities of living organisms and to protect rare and 
endangered species and their habitats; 
  -- the establishment and maintenance of an interstate 
ecological information system; 
  -- the planning and pursuit of a coordinated scientific and 
technical policy in the sphere of ecology and environmental 
protection and the organization of coordinated research projects 
in basic and applied ecology; 
  -- the elaboration and implementation of common principles 
in 
the establishment of incentives for environmental protection and 
penalties for violations of environmental laws; 
  -- the use of common procedures in environmental impact 
analyses of programs and forecasts of the development of 
productive forces, investment plans, and other project plans. 
  The collapse of the USSR and the formation of the 
Independent 
States objectively forced Russia to seek new ways of solving the 
acute ecological problems of recent years (the accident at the 
Chernobyl AES and the problem of the Aral) and problems that 
have accumulated over many decades (the degradation of soil, the 
pollution of air and water resources, the problem of waste 
management, and others). 
  The resolution of interstate ecological problems should be 
based on bilateral or multilateral treaties. 
  Due to the current absence of a single program for the 
protection of the rivers and seas of the Arctic Ocean in Russia 
and to the urgent need for ecological security, solutions will 
have to be found as quickly as possible on a bilateral basis for 
such problems as, for example, the pollution of the Irtysh, 
Ishim, and Tobol rivers, the water of which enters Russia from 
the territory of Kazakhstan in an extremely unsatisfactory 
state. Careful coordination will also be required for the joint 
resolution of the problems of the Northern Donets and Desna 
rivers with Ukraine and the problems of the Dnieper and other 
rivers with Belarus. 
  The protection of natural resources in the basin of the 
Caspian Sea will require new approaches. The protection of the 
sea's rich resources, the reproduction of its biological 
resources (particularly the sturgeon), and the protection of the 
sea itself from pollution, will necessitate the quick 
negotiation of a new agreement, by all of the states concerned, 
on an all-encompassing program for the preservation and 
augmentation of the rich resources of this unique body of water 
and the protection of the sea from pollution. 
  The same can be said of the basins of the Baltic, Black, and 
Azov seas. 
  By a decision of the governments of the Baltic states, a 
joint comprehensive program of environmental measures in the 
Baltic zone in the next 20 years was drafted and adopted at a 
diplomatic conference in April 1992 within the framework of the 
Helsinki Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment 
in the Baltic Sea (HELCOM). 
  Russia will be solving the ecological problems of the Black 
Sea region in conjunction with other Black Sea states and it 
took part in the drafting of the UNEP/UNDP/GEF plan for 
environmental controls and protective measures in the Black Sea 
region. 
  The problem of reducing anthropogenic influences on the Kola 
Peninsula has become particularly urgent in recent years because 
this is causing irreparable damage to Russia itself and is also 
having the most negative effect on the ecological situation in 
Norway and Finland. 
  The use of the water resources of the Selenga and Amur 
rivers 
is one of the issues requiring discussion with Mongolia and 
China. 
  In addition, the Russian Federation inherited commitments 
assumed by the former USSR. 
  In connection with these, the Russian Federation has taken 
part and will continue to take part in the program for the 
preservation of the Aral Sea and fulfill the obligation to 
reduce emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides in the ETR. 
<H3>  4.4. Ecological Conditions in Large Cities and Industrial 
Centers </H3>
  Anthropogenic pressure exceeded all permissible limits long 
ago in several regions and cities of the Russian Federation with 
a high concentration of industrial potential. The growth of 
industrial production is accompanied by the growth of the urban 
population and the increased density of the population in 
industrial zones with limited territory. At this time, 109 
million of the approximately 150 million people in the Russian 
Federation are living in cities--i.e., in urbanized territories. 
  The main factors influencing the environment in urbanized 
territories are the quantity and composition of emissions and 
releases of pollutants into the air and water. 
  Industry and public utilities in the cities of the 
cis-Volga, 
Ural, Central, and Northwestern regions and the large cities of 
East and West Siberia are among the main sources of air, water, 
and soil pollution. Environmental conditions in large cities and 
health resorts are affected by these factors and by vehicle 
emissions, which can exceed 70 percent of the total. 
  Total emissions from stationary sources in the 100 cities 
with the highest emission levels represent around 50 percent of 
all emissions in the Russian Federation. The enterprises of the 
Norilsk industrial center are responsible for the largest 
share--around 2.5 million tonnes, or 8 percent of all emissions 
in Russia. More than 500,000 tonnes of pollutants are discharged 
by enterprises in Novokuznetsk, Magnitogorsk, Cherepovets, and 
Lipetsk each year. 
  The polluted sewage dumped into bodies of water by industry 
and public utilities in the 100 Russian cities with the highest 
sewage dumping indicators represents around 70 percent of all 
sewage of this category in the Russian Federation. The Moscow 
sewer system handles 2.4 km[.sup]3[/] of polluted sewage each 
year, constituting almost 10 percent of this category of sewage 
in the Russian Federation. More than 0.5 km[.sup]3[/] of 
polluted sewage is discharged into bodies of water in St. 
Petersburg and Angarsk. 
  In terms of total harmful emissions and releases of sewage 
into bodies of water, the following 60 cities are the leaders: 
Moscow, Norilsk, St. Petersburg, Angarsk, Novokuznetsk, 
Krasnoyarsk, Omsk, Cherepovets, Lipetsk, Chelyabinsk, Nizhniy 
Novgorod, Samara, Bratsk, Nizhniy Tagil, Novosibirsk, 
Dzerzhinsk, Groznyy, Ufa, Yaroslavl, Arkhangelsk, Orsk, Vologda, 
Saratov, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Novokuybyshev, Kemerovo, 
Sterlitamak, Rostov-on-Don, Tolyatti, Ulyanovsk, Perm, 
Novomoskovsk, Khabarovsk, Balakovo, Tula, Barnaul, Irkutsk, 
Usolye-Sibirskoye, Vladivostok, Ivanovo, Nizhnekamsk, Krasnodar, 
Kirov, Orenburg, Kaliningrad, Kostroma, Voronezh, Salavat, 
Nevinnomyssk, Penza, Kamensk-Uralskiy, Tomsk, 
Komsomolsk-on-Amur, Ulan-Ude, Berezniki, Petrozavodsk, Belgorod, 
Cherkessk, and Prokopyevsk. 
  In cities like Magnitogorsk, Novocherkassk, Monchegorsk, 
Nikel, and several others, the degree of anthropogenic pressure 
is measured primarily in atmospheric emissions, while polluted 
sewage is the main criterion in Naberezhnyye Chelny, Syktyvkar, 
Ust-Ilimsk, Krasnokamsk, and other cities. 
  As a rule, high recorded levels of emissions and sewage 
dumping in cities and industrial centers are accompanied by 
excessive concentrations of pollutants in the air and water. The 
hydrochemical composition of the Moscow River, for example, is 
rated grade IV (``polluted'') above the city and grade VI 
(``highly contaminated'') below the city, and the water in the 
Miass River near Chelyabinsk has a grade II rating (``clean'') 
above the city and a grade VII rating (``extremely 
contaminated'') downstream. The average content of pollutants in 
the air of all 60 cities listed above exceeds maximum allowable 
concentrations, and the air in such cities as Bratsk, 
Vladivostok, Irkutsk, and Ulan-Ude is polluted by benzpyrene in 
10 or more times the norm. The same is true of the content of 
formaldehyde in the air of Komsomolsk-on-Amur and the 
ethylbenzene and carbon disulfide in Berezniki. 
  Around 50 sites of ground water pollution have been found 
within the boundaries of urbanized territories, and 70 of these 
are located close enough to public water supplies to influence 
their quality. The most serious problems with ground water 
pollution were recorded in the metropolitan areas of Moscow, 
Tula, Volgograd, Magnitogorsk, and Kemerovo. Ground water is 
polluted by sulfates, chlorides, nitrogen compounds, petroleum 
products, phenols, and heavy metals. 
  In addition to this, the water table under urban territories 
is rising almost everywhere, and this changes the chemical 
composition of the ground water and diminishes the strength and 
durability of the subsoil. This puts a strain on buildings and 
installations, reduces the service life of underground supply 
lines and increases the number of accidents on these lines, and 
promotes adverse and hazardous geological processes (karst, 
subsidence, collapse, and so forth). 
  An important element of the negative anthropogenic effects 
on 
the environment of urbanized territories is the pollution of the 
soil cover with the heavy metals in industrial emissions and 
with solid and liquid household and industrial waste. 
  Sources of radiation (waste heaps, test sites, and various 
installations) are too close to large cities in some locations. 
  Noise, electromagnetic influences, and thermal pollution in 
urbanized territories are additional factors with a detrimental 
effect on living conditions, but current controls are clearly 
inadequate. 
<H5>  4.5. Effects of Environmental Pollution on Public Health </H5>
  The changing socioeconomic conditions of life have naturally 
affected the state of public health, and this is reflected 
primarily in medical and demographic indicators. 
  Last year was the least promising of all the postwar years 
in 
Russia's demographic development. Changes in the medical and 
demographic indicators of public health attest to a lower birth 
rate (by 11 percent), a high rate of mortality (by 5 percent), 
and a substantial decrease in natural population growth. 
Indicators of oncological diseases have displayed a clear 
tendency to rise. The number of new patients is close to 400,000 
a year and shows no signs of reduction. The quality of the 
public diet has deteriorated dramatically. The shortage of 
complete protein in this diet can be as high as 20 percent, and 
vitamin deficiencies range from 30 to 50 percent. This is having 
a particularly pernicious effect on the health of children, who 
are displaying a higher rate of malnutrition. 
  Under these conditions, it is particularly difficult to 
single out the particular changes in the state of public health 
that are due to unfavorable environmental factors. 
  Some studies of the state of public health, however, suggest 
that the rate of illness, as one of the indicators of the state 
of health, is higher in territories with high levels of 
pollution than in relatively clean locations (the control group). 
  In Dorogobuzhskiy Rayon in Smolensk Oblast, for example, 
elements of the emissions from the Dorogobuzh industrial center 
(chromium, nickel, titanium, copper, and aluminum) have 
accumulated in the organism of children and nonworking women. As 
a result, the rate of pediatric respiratory disorders is 1.8 
times as high as the rate in a relatively clean region, and the 
rate of pediatric neurological disorders is 1.9 times as high. 
  Women living in the polluted zone of Tula Oblast (in 
Novomoskovsk) were more likely to suffer from complications 
during pregnancy and labor--29.8 percent and 21.3 percent 
respectively (as compared to 26.1 percent and 15.6 percent in 
the control group), and 2.11 percent or fewer of the children 
could be given the highest health rating (as compared to 4.2 
percent of the children in the control group). 
  Basically healthy children represented 38.6-50 percent (of 
the number surveyed) among the children living in the polluted 
zone of Mytishchi, whereas the figure was 73.9 percent in the 
control group. 
  Children living in the zone of exposure to the emissions of 
the Northern industrial center in Tolyatti were from 2.4 to 8.8 
times more likely to suffer from upper respiratory disease and 
bronchial asthma than children living in the relatively clean 
region, which was due to the irritating effects of nitrogen 
dioxide, formaldehyde, and ammonia, the average annual 
concentrations of which are 2-3 times the MAC. In Novocherkassk 
(Rostov Oblast), the rate of malignant neoplasms rose from 2.77 
(in 1988) to 3.57 (in 1992) per 1,000 inhabitants in the zone of 
exposure to the emissions from the electrode plant, and the rate 
of blood disorders rose from 1.25 to 4.49 per 1,000 inhabitants. 
  The emissions of enterprises nonferrous metallurgy (in 
Kirovograd in Sverdlovsk Oblast) are having an adverse effect on 
the state of reproductive processes, reflected in the increasing 
frequency of complications during pregnancy and labor (1.3 times 
the average or more). 
  People living near antibiotic production units (in Saransk) 
suffered from specific allergies to antibiotics and the candida 
antigen. 
  In rural areas of Rostov Oblast, where high levels of 
pesticides were recorded in the past (up to 20 kg/ha, with a 
regional average of 3 kg/ha), the rate of pediatric circulatory 
disease had risen by 113 percent, the rate of bronchial asthma 
in children had risen by 95 percent, and the rate of birth 
defects had risen by 55 percent by 1992. 
  Air pollution is one of the most acute problems in Siberian 
cities because of the extremely diverse composition of emissions 
and the unfavorable meteorological conditions of their 
dispersion. 
  In zones of intense air pollution, people are 2.3-3.1 times 
as likely to seek medical treatment for circulatory and 
cardiovascular ailments and genetic developmental defects. 
  Studies of the effects of environmental pollution on public 
health in the region of the Kansk-Achinsk fuel and energy 
complex (KATEK) indicated that the relative contribution to 
respiratory disorders was 51.6 percent for pollution, 21 percent 
for seasonal factors, and 22.5 percent for age-related factors. 
  In the cities of Chelyabinsk Oblast, where enterprises of 
ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy are responsible for more than 
80 percent of all emissions, there was a higher rate of illness 
in children and adults (in comparison with the control group--a 
city with machine-building enterprises) with endocrine, 
circulatory, and respiratory disorders; children were more 
likely to suffer from birth defects, and adults were more likely 
to suffer from complications during pregnancy and labor, skin 
diseases, and malignant neoplasms. The probability of various 
substances affecting the rate of illness was the following: 
11.6-42.5 percent for lead, 19.4-33.6 percent for benzpyrene, 
17.6-38.4 percent for ammonia, 3.6-16.8 percent for phenol, 
6.25-26.0 percent for nitrogen dioxide, and 32.5-98.0 percent 
for the combine effects of dust, sulfur dioxide, carbon 
monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide. 
  When data on requests for medical treatment, the 
characteristics of emissions, and air quality were collated in 
Perm Oblast, simulation models indicated that 10 of 19 
categories of illness (52.6 percent) in children and 11 of the 
19 (57.8 percent) in adults had a distinct relationship to 
environmental factors. Furthermore, the cases of urogenital 
disorders (in Krasnokamsk) and osteomuscular disease (in 
Chusovoy and Aleksandrovsk) in children were caused by 
environmental pollution. 
  In the cities of the Kuzbass, where the public water supply 
comes from the Tom River, the quality of this water is having an 
adverse effect on the health of children, and this is 
particularly apparent in Yurga. In the last five years 
indicators of the frequency of premature births and birth 
defects rose to 1.5-6 times the previous levels. 
  Ever since the Chernobyl disaster the population of 17 
oblasts in Russia, especially the population of the western 
regions of Bryansk and Kaluga oblasts, has continued to be 
exposed to external and internal radiation by long-lived 
radionuclides--cesium-137, cesium-134, and strontium-90--and 
transuranic elements--plutonium-238, 239, and 240, 
americium-241, and others. For six years the residents of the 
most highly polluted regions of Bryansk Oblast were exposed to 
an average effective dose of 42 mZv (not counting the effects of 
iodine-131 on the thyroid). The cumulative effective dose over 
the six years was 5,000 man-Zv. If all protective measures are 
cancelled in 1993, the anticipated cumulative effective dose in 
subsequent years will add another 7,000 man-Zv, but if these 
measures remain in place it will add only 3,00-4,000 man-Zv. The 
medical consequences of this cumulative dose of radiation could 
amount to 400-6,000 fatal cases of oncological disease and 
100-150 genetic developmental defects in the 70 years following 
the accident. The anticipated rise in the rate of all types of 
pathology will be from 2 to 4 percent of the spontaneous level. 
The cumulative dose of thyroid radiation by iodine-131 for the 
same group was 22,000 man-Zv in 1986, which could cause around 
70 cases of thyroid cancer, around 7 of which would be fatal. 
  The anticipated increase in spontaneous thyroid cancer in 
this group will be from 20 to 40 percent, and the rate will rise 
by 1.5-2 times for people born between 1980 and 1986. 
Preliminary data on the rate of illness (in 1992) in the 
territories of radioactive pollution in Bryansk Oblast did not 
reveal the anticipated rise in the rate of thyroid cancer and 
malignant neoplasms of the hemopoietic and lymphatic systems in 
children or adults. 
  The most unfavorable radiation conditions resulting from the 
accidents at the Mayak Scientific Production Association in 
Chelyabinsk, distinguished by high levels of radiation and 
prolonged exposure, developed in the coastal regions of the 
Techa River (in Chelyabinsk and Kurgan oblasts). The average 
absorbed dose of radiation for the population of the upper 
reaches of the river had reached 170 cZv by 1992. Cases of 
chronic radiation sickness had been recorded here earlier, and 
now there are signs of a higher rate of oncological disease, 
including leukemia. 
  Radioactive tracks from nuclear tests on the Semipalatinsk 
test range prior to 1964 reached regions of Altay Kray and part 
of the territory of the Altay Republic. Now these areas are 
displaying a striking increase in oncological diseases of the 
pulmonary, female reproductive, lymphatic, and hematopoeic 
systems. Special programs are being conducted by scientific 
institutions and other organizations in these regions for 
in-depth studies of the state of public health and the possible 
effects of radiation on public health. There is a similar 
situation in regions of the Far North, where it will be 
essential to study the population of the exposure zone of the 
Novaya Zemlya nuclear test site. This is also the location of 
the geographic accumulation of all of the global fall-out from 
nuclear tests conducted by all countries of the northern 
hemisphere in the far northern latitudes. Concerned ministries 
and departments are drawing up a special comprehensive program 
for this and are already doing some of the necessary research.

<H6>  Section 5. Industrial Accidents, Natural Emergencies, and 
Their Ecological Consequences and Prevention </H6>
<H5>  5.1. Accidents </H5>
  In 1992, according to the data of the Information Center of 
the Russian State Committee on Emergency Situations (GKChS), 
there were 769 emergency situations (ChS) of a technogenic 
nature in the Russian Federation, with 2,523 victims, including 
870 fatalities (the respective figures in 1991 were 2,693 and 
1,023) (see figures 5.1.1-5.1.3). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-85A>           Figure 5.1.1. Technogenic </FIG>





<FIG ID=JPRS-TEN-005-86A>           Figure 5.1.2. Fatalities in </FIG>






  Most of the industrial ChS were fires and explosions (314) 
and transport accidents (298). The victims of transport 
accidents numbered 1,762, including 698 fatalities. There were 
1,117 victims of traffic accidents on highways, including 374 
fatalities, and the respective figures for air disasters were 
357 and 248. 
  Fires and explosions caused the greatest financial damage to 
the national economy. According to the data of Gosgortekhnadzor 
[Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight], there were 
430 production-related accidents with 652 fatalities. The slight 
decrease in human losses in the technical sphere was due to the 
considerable decrease in production rates and volumes. In highly 
hazardous branches there was a tendency toward more accidents 
with graver consequences. 
  There were 126 accidents at enterprises of the coal 
industry, 
including 22 explosions and deflagrations of methane and coal 
oil, 57 fires, 14 cave-ins, 3 unexpected coal and gas blowouts, 
and 4 water and slurry breakthroughs. In all, 263 people died in 
these accidents (185 in 1991). 
  The number of accidents at the mining enterprises of ferrous 
metallurgy, agrochemical resources, and building materials 
production rose from 19 to 28. 
  Ten accidents at enterprises of the metallurgical industry 
(five in 1991) claimed 30 lives. 
  The number of accident victims increased in mining and 
nonmetalliferous industries in 1992: by 18 percent at the mining 
enterprises of ferrous metallurgy, by a factor of 2.5 in 
agrochemical resource production, and by 100 percent in the 
building materials industry. 
  The protracted operation, unsatisfactory state, and constant 
overloading of the structural elements of buildings and 
installations caused cave-ins and collapses at the Severnyy Pipe 
Plant, the Chusovoy Metallurgical Plant, and the Pechenganikel 
Combine. Several buildings and installations of the Kuznetsk and 
Orsk-Khalilov metallurgical combines are in the same state. 
  There were 24 fatalities (11 in 1991) at enterprises and 
installations of the Rosneftegaz Corporation and other oil and 
gas enterprises (joint-stock companies, joint ventures, and 
other types of enterprises), where the number of accidents rose 
from 16 to 21. There was an increase in the number of accidents 
in this branch connected with fires (of 50 percent), derrick 
damage (75 percent), and the collapse of rigs (20 percent). The 
number of oil and gas spouters decreased from 10 to 8, but they 
still accounted for a high percentage of all accidents (27 
percent). The results of an inventory of branch enterprises in 
1992 (during which around 400,000 objects were inspected) 
revealed that 12,000 objects had to be shut down immediately, 
and 4,300 required radical renovation and modernization. 
  In all, 35 accidents were recorded in the oil and gas 
pipelines and compressor and pumping stations overseen by the 
Russian Federation Gosgortekhnadzor. The main causes were 
corrosion, mechanical failures, faulty construction and 
installation work, and pipe defects. Breaks in pipelines and 
spills of petroleum products were accompanied in many cases by 
the severe contamination of the soil, surface water, and seas 
(in the Komi Republic, Khabarovsk and Maritime krays, 
Arkhangelsk and Kurgan oblasts, and other locations). 
  There were 83 accidents at enterprises of the chemical, 
petrochemical, agrochemical, microbiological, and petroleum 
refining industries with damage to production equipment, 
buildings, and installations. The situation was most alarming at 
chemical enterprises of the Bashkortostan Republic, Stavropol 
Kray, and Irkutsk and Orenburg oblasts. 
  The main causes of production-related accidents were 
flagrant 
violations of safety requirements by supervisors, specialists, 
and personnel, deviations from established procedures and 
regulations, the structural defects and malfunctions of 
equipment, machines, and mechanisms, and faulty designs. 
  There was a higher number of emergency situations and 
accidents in the transport of hazardous freight by rail. More 
than 75 percent of these incidents were connected with the 
transport of hazardous freight in damaged tank cars. 
  There were 12 train wrecks and accidents and 1,020 other 
incidents, including spills of hydrocarbons, petroleum products, 
and various chemicals, on the main trunk lines and industrial 
rail lines. Environmental pollution as a result of these 
incidents was recorded on many railroads (Transbaykal, Gorkiy, 
Baykal-Amur, Moscow, Oktyabr, Northern, Southeastern, and West 
Siberian). 
  Accidents resulting in the release of virulent toxic 
substances (VTS) represented 4.7 percent of all the technogenic 
emergencies. 
  Accidents in supply lines (ranking third among all 
accidents)--sewer systems and mains--resulted in the release of 
liquid waste in surface bodies of water in Perm, Omsk, and 
Khabarovsk and caused serious environmental damage. 
  There were 49 accidents at gas works, and the number of 
fatalities rose from 6 to 13. The state of gas lines in Moscow 
and St. Petersburg is particularly unsatisfactory. More than 
2,000 kilometers of gas lines require immediate replacement, and 
18,000 kilometers have to be protected from electrochemical 
corrosion. 
  The number of accidents connected with the operation of 
boilers and furnaces increased by 36 percent in 1992. 
  There were 205 violations of regulations at operating 
nuclear 
power plants (AES), as compared to 164 in 1991 (an increase of 
19 percent), with 75 percent occurring in power plants with VVER 
reactors and 20 percent in plants with RBMK reactors. 
  The most serious violations were the accident in the third 
reactor of the Leningrad AES, accompanied by the release of 
excess radioactive substances (RV) into the environment, and the 
personnel error resulting in the release of radioactive water 
into the cooling tank at the Beloyarskaya AES (total activity of 
0.093 in relation to the annual maximum). 
  No nuclear or radiation accidents or violations resulting in 
unsafe operating conditions were recorded in 75 research 
reactors and critical and subcritical test units in 1992. After 
the two industrial reactors of the mineral chemical combine in 
Krasnoyarsk-26 were shut down in 1992 (in accordance with a 
decree of the Russian Gosatomnadzor [Russian Federal Oversight 
of Nuclear and Radiation Safety]), radiation readings in waste 
disposal sites in the Yenisey River improved dramatically. 
  An analysis of the industrial accidents from the regional 
standpoint indicated that the highest number (61) occurred in 
Tyumen Oblast and in Krasnodar (39) and Krasnoyarsk (43) krays. 
Most of these were fires and explosions. 
  A significant increase in the number of industrial accidents 
and in the number of accidental injuries was also recorded in 
many oblasts, primarily Amur, Belgorod, Irkutsk, Kemerovo, 
Murmansk, Orenburg, Perm, Rostov, Saratov, Sverdlovsk, Tula, 
Chita, and Yaroslavl. 
<H5>  5.2. Natural Emergencies </H5>
  In 1992, according to the data of the Information Center of 
the Russian GKChS, there were 189 emergency situations with 
natural causes in the Russian Federation (166 in 1991), with 
4,390 victims and 86 fatalities (respective figures of 13,486 
and 112 in 1991) (Figure 5.2.1). 



  The disaster claiming the highest number of victims (934) 
was 
the epidemic of dysentery in Georgiyevsk in Stavropol Kray, and 
the majority of the victims (541) were children between the ages 
of 1 and 14. The source of the pathogen was not located. Another 
224 people, including 81 children, came down with salmonella at 
the Verkhnevolzhskaya Campgrounds (in Tver Oblast). Contaminated 
meat caused numerous cases of aphthous fever in Krasnoyarsk 
Kray, and six people came down with anthrax in Bashkortostan. 
There were numerous cases of mushroom poisoning in several parts 
of Russia. This happened to 311 people just in Voronezh Oblast, 
and 23 of them died. There were 15 cases of infectious diseases 
of agricultural livestock, including classic hog cholera 
(Kaluga, Tver, Pskov, and Volgograd oblasts). Losses of cattle 
due to disease were substantial in the Tuva Republic. 
  The most common type of natural disaster was the earthquake 
(38 in all), although the number in 1992 was not extraordinary. 
Earthquakes occurred most frequently on the Kuril Islands (12) 
and the Kamchatka Peninsula (10). Chechnya and Dagestan had 
three earthquakes each, and two were recorded in the Baykal zone. 
  Stavropol Kray suffered material losses (of around 2 million 
rubles) as a result of protracted torrential rains, hail, and 
flooding. Homes, roads, and agricultural structures were 
damaged, 40,000 hectares of grain crops were destroyed, and 
72,000 hectares of other crops were damaged. 
  In addition, 18 avalanches, 3 mudslides, and 1 landslide 
were 
recorded. The North Caucasus is the region most prone to 
avalanches: 11 were recorded in North Ossetia, and the rest 
occurred in Dagestan, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachay-Cherkessia, 
and Ingushetia. Avalanches have been particularly frequent in 
the Rekskiy mountain pass because of the excessive use of this 
road. Chita Oblast and Khakassia had one avalanche each. 
Although the year was close to normal in the number of 
avalanches, five people died and highways and railroads were 
obstructed. Mud slides in the North Caucasus killed three people. 
  The Russian Emergency Early Warning and Action System 
(RSChS) 
was established in 1992 for the reliable interaction of all 
government administrative bodies in emergency prevention and 
cleanup operations. This is the first attempt to define the 
functions and coordinate the actions of all government 
administrative bodies and the forces and resources under their 
jurisdiction in emergency prevention and recovery operations. 
The organization and functioning of the RSChS should secure a 
quick and efficient response to all emergency situations and the 
timely assistance of victims. 
  More than 13,000 people and more than 2,000 pieces of 
equipment of departmental units and civil defense (GO) forces 
participated in clean-up operations. Funds in excess of 5 
billion rubles were allocated for emergency grants to the 
population and priority projects. 
  The fundamentals of legislation on the protection of the 
population and territories in emergency situations were drafted 
and submitted to the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet for 
consideration in order to establish a set of legal standards in 
the protection of the population and territories from the 
effects of industrial accidents and natural disasters. These 
include laws on civil defense, the emergency rescue service, the 
status of the rescuing party, the provision of the population 
and state governing and administrative bodies with information 
about emergency situations, and industrial safety. 
  The reduction of the number and severity of the consequences 
of major accidents, catastrophes, and natural disasters will 
require the following: the reorganization of existing systems 
for the forecasting and departmental monitoring of dangerous 
natural phenomena and the creation of additional systems to 
secure seismic safety; the informational linking of departmental 
monitoring systems within the framework of the Russian GKChS 
automated data management system; the reorganization of 
emergency rescue units and their provision with modern equipment. 
  These problems could be solved within the confines of 
federal 
programs for the equipping and training of emergency rescue 
units, irrespective of their departmental jurisdiction. 
<H6>  Section 6. Government Regulation of Resource Use and 
Environmental Protection </H6>
<H5>  6.1. Environmental Laws and Penalties for Violations </H5>
  Legislation in the sphere of environmental protection and 
resource use was being developed on all levels of the Russian 
Federation Government throughout 1992. 
  The Law of the RSFSR ``On the Protection of the Natural 
Environment'' went into force on 3 March 1992. In less than a 
year it played a positive role by encouraging citizens and 
public associations to be more active in the resolution of many 
environmental problems. The law also revealed many weak points 
in the state system of resource use and exposed many defects and 
shortcomings in the functioning and interaction of separate 
government agencies and the flawed and sometimes contradictory 
articles in the law itself and in other related legislative 
instruments. 
  The Law of the Russian Federation ``On Security'' was 
approved and enacted on 5 March 1992. It named environmental 
protection agencies among the forces and resources safeguarding 
national security. Ecological security issues are among the 
concerns of the Russian Federation Security Council that was 
established by this law. The heads of federal ministries and 
departments of ecology and natural resources may serve as 
council members. One of the main functions of the Russian 
Federation Security Council is the drafting of timely decisions 
on the prevention of emergency situations with major ecological 
implications and the organization of recovery operations. 
  The Law of the Russian Federation ``On Mineral Resources'' 
went into force in May 1992 and regulates relations arising 
during the process of the study, use, and protection of mineral 
resources within the territory of the Russian Federation and its 
continental shelf and maritime economic zone and the use of the 
waste products of mining industries and related processing 
production units and the extraction of peat, sapropel, and other 
specific mineral resources. 
  The law states the legal and economic fundamentals of the 
intelligent use and protection of mineral resources and protects 
the interests of the state and citizens of the Russian 
Federation and the rights of resource users. 
  The Law of the RSFSR ``On Land Fees'' went into force in 
January 1992 in accordance with an RSFSR Supreme Soviet decree 
of 11 October 1991 and underwent some revision and 
supplementation in February 1992. One of the reasons for the 
institution of land fees was the need to establish the legal 
basis of land ownership that was lacking in the Russian 
Federation Constitution and to provide incentives for the 
intelligent use and protection of land. The decrees of the 
Russian Federation Government ``On Land Monitoring'' (No 491, 15 
July 1992), ``On the Approval of the Statute on the Procedure 
for the Temporary Prohibition of the Use of Damaged Agricultural 
Lands and Lands Polluted by Toxic Industrial Waste and 
Radioactive Substances'' (No 555, 5 August 1992), ``On the 
Improvement of State Land Surveys in the Russian Federation'' 
(No 622, 25 August 1992), and ``On the Approval of the Statute 
on the Procedure for Instituting State Control Over the Use and 
Protection of Land'' (No 594, 17 August 1992) pertain directly 
to the economic aspects of land use. The last of these statutes 
identifies the government agencies specifically authorized to 
exercise state control over the use and protection of land: 
Roskomzem [Russian Federation Committee on Land Resources and 
Land Management], the Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology, 
the Russian Federation Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight], and Gosarkhstroynadzor 
[State Committee for Architecture and Construction Oversight], 
lists their functions and the rights and obligations of 
officials, and stipulates the procedure for collecting fines for 
violations of land laws. 
  The following legal instruments pertaining to environmental 
protection in specific regions of the Russian Federation and 
envisaging measures for the improvement and conservation of 
natural resources were enacted in 1992. 
  The Russian Federation Presidential Edict ``On the 
Protection 
of the Natural Resources of the Territorial Waters, Continental 
Shelf, and Economic Zone of the Russian Federation'' (No 436, 5 
May 1992). 
  The Russian Federation Presidential Edict ``On Natural 
Territories Under Special Protection in the Russian Federation'' 
(No 1155, 2 October 1992). 
  The Russian Federation Presidential Directive ``On Measures 
To Protect the Population and Solve Problems Connected with the 
Rising Level of the Caspian Sea'' (No 643-rp, 31 October 1992). 
  The RSFSR Government Decree ``On Immediate Measures To 
Protect the Shores of the Black and Azov Seas from Destruction 
and To Improve the Ecological State of Coastal Resort Zones in 
Krasnodar Kray'' (No 2, 2 January 1992). 
  Many of the legislative instruments of 1992 focused on the 
social protection of citizens exposed to radiation as a result 
of the disaster at the Chernobyl AES and on regulations 
governing contaminated territories: 
  The Russian Federation Government Decree ``On Measures To 
Implement the Law of the RSFSR `On the Social Protection of 
Citizens Exposed to Radiation as a Result of the Disaster at the 
Chernobyl AES''' (No 113, 26 February 1992). 
  The Law of the Russian Federation ``On Amendments and 
Additions to the Law of the RSFSR `On the Social Protection of 
Citizens Exposed to Radiation as a Result of the Disaster at the 
Chernobyl AES''' of 18 June 1992. 
  The Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Decree on the 
procedure 
for enacting this law (No 3062-1, 18 June 1992). 
  The Decree of the Council of Ministers--Government of the 
Russian Federation ``On the Regulations Governing Territories 
Contaminated by Radioactive Substances as a Result of the 
Disaster at the Chernobyl AES'' (No 1008, 25 December 1992). 
  Decree No 869 of the Russian Federation Government of 12 
November 1992 ``On the State Registration of Potentially 
Hazardous Chemical and Biological Substances'' was passed to 
prevent the adverse effects of potentially hazardous chemical 
and biological substances on human health and the environment. 
The decree charged the State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight and the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources with 
the responsibility of keeping the federal register of 
potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances of 
natural and artificial origins. The statute does not apply to 
chemical and biological means of plant protection, plant growth 
regulators, and pharmaceuticals. 
  In addition, there were Russian Federation government 
decrees 
pertaining directly to the improvement of ecological conditions 
in the country: 
  ``On the More Effective Use of Hydrometeorological 
Information and Environmental Pollution Data in the National 
Economy'' (No 532, 3 August 1992). 
  ``On Immediate Measures To Secure the Supply of Drinking 
Water in the Russian Federation'' (No 802, 18 October 1992). 
  The following decrees of the Russian Federation Government 
pertained to the economic mechanisms of resource use: 
  ``On the Federal Ecological Fund of the Russian Federation 
and Ecological Funds Within the Territory of the Russian 
Federation'' (No 442, 29 June 1992). 
  ``On the Approval of the Procedure for Drafting and 
Approving 
the Ecological Limits on Emissions and Releases of Pollutants 
into the Environment and Limits on the Use of Natural Resources 
and the Disposal of Waste'' (No 545, 3 August 1992). 
  ``On the Approval of the Procedure for Calculating Fees and 
Maximum Payments for Environmental Pollution, Waste Disposal, 
and Other Practices with Dangerous Implications'' (No 632, 28 
August 1992). 
  The Federation Treaty Delineating the Spheres of Authority 
and Jurisdiction of Federal Government Agencies and the 
Government Agencies of Sovereign States Belonging to the Russian 
Federation, which was signed in March 1992, introduced 
substantial changes into the work of improving environmental 
protection laws. 
  According to Article 2 of the Federation Treaty and Article 
81-add of the Russian Federation Constitution, resource use, 
environmental protection, ecological safety, and environmental 
laws are under the joint jurisdiction of federal government 
agencies of the Russian Federation and the government agencies 
of the republics belonging to the Russian Federation. 
  The same articles state the procedure by which the federal 
government agencies of the Russian Federation will publish the 
fundamentals of legislation on all of the matters listed above 
to serve as a guide for the government agencies of the republics 
belonging to the Russian Federation in their own legal 
regulation, including the passage of laws and other legislative 
instruments. 
  It was on this basis that several of the republics belonging 
to the Russian Federation began drafting their own laws on 
environmental protection and related sectorial laws regulating 
the use of resources. 
  The regulation of resource use is under the joint 
jurisdiction of federal government agencies of the Russian 
Federation and the government agencies of krays, oblasts, the 
cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, the autonomous oblast, and 
autonomous okrugs belonging to the Russian Federation. 
  Government agencies of the Russian Federation will also 
publish fundamentals of legislation on these matters to serve as 
a guide for the government agencies of krays, oblasts, the 
cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, and the autonomous 
territories when they exercise their own legal regulation within 
their spheres of authority by adopting legislative instruments. 
  In 1992 the administration of resource use within the 
territory of krays, oblasts, and autonomous territories was 
based on legislation of the Russian Federation, the decisions of 
kray and oblast soviets of people's deputies, and the directives 
and decrees of kray and oblast administrations. 
  The absence of a legal basis for the ownership of natural 
resources in the Russian Federation Constitution precludes the 
creation of a system of clarifying laws that do not conflict 
with one another and do meet the interests of the population of 
the whole country. 
  Terminological ambiguities create unequal relationships 
between members of the federation and could give rise to 
conflicts on various territorial-administrative levels. 
  Declarations issued by several of the republics belonging to 
the Russian Federation contained demands for the sole ownership 
of the natural resources in these republics, which would 
restrict the application of the existing Constitution of the 
Russian Federation and federal legislative instruments. 
  The absence of a procedure for enforcing certain standards 
established by law is a weak link in the existing legal system 
and is complicating relations between economic entities and 
government agencies in the sphere of resource use. The necessary 
delineation of the spheres of authority of government agencies 
in relation to economic entities is lacking. 
  Because of ambiguous wording, the duplication of powers and 
responsibilities, and the absence of clearly defined enactment 
procedures, existing laws cannot settle all of the questions 
about the legal regulation of resource use. 
  During inspections to verify the observance of environmental 
laws, state environmental oversight agencies surveyed around 
286,000 enterprises and organizations in Russia and learned that 
more than 16.6 percent were violating environmental emission and 
release standards. Administrative actions were taken against 
38,733 individuals for violations of these laws, and total fines 
exceeded 82.5 million rubles. Criminal proceedings were 
instituted against 25 individuals. 
  Fines collected for violations of environmental laws in 
1992, 
including earlier judgments, exceeded 833 million rubles, and 
the operations of more than 700 separate shops, units, and 
installations were suspended. 
  The numerous violations of regulations governing the use and 
protection of land were striking. 
  Government agencies overseeing the observance of the 
requirements of land and environmental laws conducted 90,000 
inspections of land use and environmental protection practices 
in 1992 in their spheres of authority, including 58,600 
inspections by agencies of Roskomzem, 29,400 by the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Ecology, and 2,000 by Gosarkhstroynadzor. 
  The inspections turned up 60,800 violations covering an area 
of 1.6 million hectares. Juridical persons were responsible for 
34,900 violations covering an area of 1.584 million hectares and 
citizens committed 24,500 violations covering a total of 24,600 
hectares. The most common violations were the unauthorized 
occupation of parcels of land--31.4 percent, littering--13.9 
percent, the contamination of land--42.2 percent, and the misuse 
or destruction of the fertile layer of soil--3.6 percent. 
  When these cases were reviewed, administrative penalties 
were 
imposed on 26,700 violators, and fines totaling 359.1 million 
rubles were collected from 17,600 of them, including 188.2 
million rubles collected by agencies of Roskomzem, 167.7 million 
collected by the Russian Ministry of Ecology, and 3.2 million 
collected by the Russian Gosarkhstroynadzor. 
  Law suits for damages yielded judgments totaling 164 million 
rubles, including 111 million rubles in suits filed by agencies 
of the Russian Ministry of Ecology and 53 million in suits filed 
by Roskomzem. 
  In addition, banks stopped financing various projects 
entailing violations of existing laws and requirements with 
regard to land protection in 180 cases at the request of 
agencies of the Russian Ministry of Ecology (153), Roskomzem 
(21), and the Russian Gosarkhstroy [State Committee on Questions 
of Architecture and Construction] (6). 
  The files on 1,249 violations, connected primarily with the 
unauthorized occupation of land, were forwarded to investigative 
agencies, which reviewed the reports and then instituted 
criminal proceedings against 64 individuals. 
  Cases of violations were also reviewed by soviets of 
people's 
deputies, administrations, and the superiors of the 
organizations at fault at the request of agencies monitoring the 
use and protection of land, and disciplinary actions were taken 
against certain officials as a result. 
  In cases of violations of the laws on mineral resources and 
regulations and instructions on the protection of mineral 
resources, the Russian Gosgortekhnadzor suspended 1,247 projects 
and took action against 1,039 officials, including the 
collection of fines from 433. In addition, financial penalties 
were imposed on organizations for excessive losses of useful 
minerals at the request of agencies of the Russian 
Gosgortekhnadzor. 
  Forestry agencies filed claims for 1.677 million rubles in 
fines to be collected from timber users for violations during 
the year. 
  There were 126,000 violations of laws on the protection of 
fish resources in internal fisheries (with the exception of 
ponds in Dagestan and Yakutia), and the violators were fined a 
total of 67.7 million rubles. 
  In 1992 specialized maritime boards of inspection of the 
Russian Ministry of Ecology levied fines and filed claims for 
more than 44 million rubles and 25 million U.S. dollars against 
violators of environmental laws for marine pollution. 
  Inspectors of the Fishery Protection Service conducted 3,500 
inspections of Russian and foreign fishing vessels in 1992, 
discovered 458 violations of fishing regulations, and imposed 
fines and filed claims for a total of 1.9 million rubles. During 
the same period the inspectors of specialized maritime boards of 
inspection imposed fines and filed claims for a total of around 
8 billion rubles, including 650 million rubles in claims against 
the fishery protection agencies themselves, for violations of 
environmental laws in internal seas and territorial waters, on 
the continental shelf, and in the maritime economic zone of the 
Russian Federation. 
  Environmental laws are enforced by specially authorized 
agencies in the sphere of environmental protection and by the 
law enforcement agencies of internal affairs, the courts, the 
procuracy, and the arbitration courts. 
  In the environmental sphere the procuracy is empowered to 
oversee the uniform enforcement of laws by environmental 
monitoring agencies and state governing and administrative 
bodies, verify that the measures taken by these agencies against 
violators are legal and thorough, and protect the right of 
citizens to live in an ecologically healthy environment. 
  At this time 66 environmental procuracies are overseeing the 
enforcement of environmental laws. 
  In 1992 agencies of the Russian Federation Procuracy 
conducted 5,623 inspections to verify the enforcement of 
environmental laws. The results served as the basis for measures 
to eliminate violations and their causes and contributing 
factors. Requests and protests filed by procurators resulted in 
the rescission of 1,915 illegal legislative instruments, 
including 79 through people's courts. Procurators filed 3,873 
reports of violations and requested the imposition of 
disciplinary, administrative, and financial penalties on 6,300 
officials. 
  Procurators filed suits for 500 million rubles in people's 
courts and arbitration courts for compensation for the 
environmental damage caused by unlawful actions. Criminal 
proceedings were instituted against 416 people in 291 criminal 
cases of environmental pollution and violations of environmental 
laws. 
  Internal affairs agencies investigated 880 criminal cases of 
illegal fishing, sealskin trading, illegal hunting, and the 
clear-cutting of forests by 1,269 individuals and took the cases 
to court. 
  In 1992 arbitration courts in the Russian Federation settled 
5,823 disputes connected with violations of environmental laws 
(3,342 in 1991), filed claims totaling 4,509,179,000 rubles 
(292,706,000 in 1991), and actually collected 2,808,050,000 
rubles (113,729,000 in 1991). 
  The continued improvement of Russian laws and standards with 
a view to the previously mentioned Federation Treaty should lay 
the necessary legal foundation for effective activity by 
environmental protection agencies and law enforcement agencies 
on all levels in securing legality in the sphere of resource use. 
<H5>  6.2. Government Ecological Programs and Their Implementation </H5>
  The drafting and implementation of state, interstate, and 
regional ecological programs constitute one of the main 
instruments for the realization of the fundamentals of state 
policy on environmental protection and resource use. 
  In 1992 the Russian Federation had around 150 programs in 
the 
sphere of environmental protection and resource use in various 
stages of drafting and implementation. More than 70 of these 
(covering almost all of the territory of the country and drafted 
in 1990-1991) envisaged specific protective measures, some of 
which are being carried out at this time. Most of the programs 
have been financed by local budgets, ecological funds, and 
enterprise resources. 
  Ecological programs can be divided into the following groups 
in line with their objectives: 
  -- federal (interregional, international, basin, natural 
complex, etc.); 
  -- territorial (within the territorial boundaries of members 
of the federation); 
  -- natural-resource (the use and protection of water, soil, 
forests, live resources, etc.); 
  -- sectorial (the resolution of environmental problems in 
accordance with separate programs in branches of industry, in 
transportation, in agriculture, etc.); 
  Resource and sectorial programs have varying territorial 
confines. 
  A program acquires official state status after the passage 
of 
the corresponding resolution by the Supreme Soviet or the 
Russian Federation Government on its drafting and approval. 
  There are also distinctions between ecological programs 
securing the current development of economic activity in the 
society, programs for the elimination of extraordinary 
ecological situations as a result of natural disasters and 
industrial accidents or catastrophes, and programs of immediate 
measures to ensure ecological safety in a particular region or 
territory (in certain cities, for example, such as Novokuznetsk, 
Magnitogorsk, Nizhniy Tagil, Chelyabinsk, Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk, 
and Norilsk and in the basins of the Black and Azov seas, the 
Volga River, Lake Baykal, and others). 
  The first of these have been carried out continuously 
throughout the country, with their sequence and rate of 
implementation (or order of priority) based on an analysis of 
the ecological situation in the country with a view to economic 
development, and are primarily of a preventive nature. The 
second are drafted and implemented quickly, depending on the 
severity of ecological consequences and the effects on human 
health, and the third assign priority to the improvement of the 
current grave ecological situation. This group of programs is 
most heavily dependent on strong and regular support from the 
federal budget, particularly during the initial phase of 
implementation. 
  Ecological programs are based on compromises with regard to 
the conversion to ecologically safe methods of economic activity 
for the enhancement of environmental quality and the guarantee 
of the natural development of natural objects and ecosystems 
with a view to actual capabilities and ecological consequences. 
  The procedure for drafting and implementing special federal 
programs of development in the Russian Federation and special 
interstate programs involving the Russian Federation was 
approved in 1992. In accordance with this procedure, the 
government will choose the state client for the drafting and 
implementation of the state program, with a detailed list of 
quantitative parameters, the compilation of specific plans and 
work schedules for different stages of the program, the 
development of a sophisticated mechanism for carrying out the 
program, and the choice of all the participants and the volumes 
and sources of funding for the program. Programs will be 
financed by funds from the republic budget of the Russian 
Federation and special extrabudgetary sources through the state 
clients responsible for the completion of the programs. Foreign 
investors may assist in financing the programs as partners. 
State clients will arrange for competitive bidding for each 
specific stage of the program and distribute finances among the 
parties working on each stage by signing state contracts with 
them. 
  Different branches of industry and members of the federation 
have submitted proposals to the government on the drafting and 
approval of many development programs for different fields of 
science, economic activities, and territories. The programs are 
aimed at producing qualitatively new commodities, generating 
profits, and improving social conditions for the population. The 
attainment of these objectives will contribute to environmental 
health, because the renewal of fixed assets and the move to new 
technologies should be more progressive in the ecological sense. 
Nevertheless, sectorial and administrative priorities will not 
coincide with priorities in the sphere of environmental 
protection and the intelligent use of natural resources, and the 
ecological factor is usually not the primary consideration in 
these programs. 
  In view of the limited nature of federal funds and the 
selective (or specific) approach to the choice of enterprises 
warranting state support, enterprises with adverse effects on 
natural spheres, ecosystems, and separate natural objects might 
not be included in sectorial priority projects. 
  In 1992, 14 special federal ecological programs were drafted 
and submitted for inclusion in the draft federal program for the 
restructuring of the Russian economy. The programs are listed 
below.

<H5>  6.3. Fundamental Standards and Procedures </H5>
  The fundamental standards and procedures of environmental 
protection in the Russian Federation are still being updated. 
The earlier environmental standards and rules of economic 
development, which were borrowed from various spheres and 
branches of activity, have been among the factors causing the 
present ecological crisis in the national economy of the Russian 
Federation. 
  A state ecological appraisal of existing legal standards, 
procedural instructions, and technical standards for the 
prevention of air pollution by the Russian Ministry of Ecology 
in 1992 revealed that most of these documents did not meet 
current ecological requirements, could not secure safe societal 
development, were outdated, and were of no help to a project 
planner in the advance assessment of the possible adverse 
ecological effects of economic or other decisions. Only 8 of the 
328 inspected documents in this sphere meet present 
requirements, 291 must be updated, and 29 were recommended for 
rescission by ecological experts. 
  The Law of the Russian Federation ``On Environmental 
Protection'' defines the criteria to be used in judging 
environmental quality and the ability of resource users to use 
these criteria in their economic activity. 
  The quality criteria are based on three indicators: medical 
(the maximum threat to human health and the human genetic code), 
technological (the potential to limit effects on the human being 
and the conditions of human survival), scientific-technical (the 
ability of technical equipment to monitor the observance of 
these limits in terms of all parameters). 
  Environmental standards impose requirements on the source of 
danger and limit the maximum impact. These are the standards 
defining the maximum permissible chemical, physical, biological, 
and radiation effects, emission standards, hazardous waste 
disposal standards, etc. 
  The ability of these standards to limit harmful effects is 
secured by three factors: 
  -- the correspondence of standards to the current level of 
science and technology and to international standards; 
  -- the approval of the standards by specially authorized 
government agencies; 
  -- the obligation of all economic entities to comply with 
these standards and the penalties for noncompliance by 
enterprises, organizations, and citizens. 
  The ecological requirements imposed on all economic 
structures are also reflected in the fundamental procedures of 
environmental protection. They apply to enterprises, 
organizations, and institutions, irrespective of forms of 
ownership and jurisdiction, and to citizens. Foreign juridical 
and physical persons acting as investors, entrepreneurs, and so 
forth are beginning to occupy a perceptible place among the 
parties to economic operations. In line with the move to the 
market economy, ecological requirements will be set on three 
levels: 
  -- economic entities; 
  -- stages of the economic process (project planning, siting, 
design, construction, start-up, and operation); 
  -- types of economic impact (agriculture, land reclamation, 
power engineering, urban development, etc.). 
  Experience has shown that this approach is warranted as a 
means of averting and preventing the negative ecological 
implications of various economic decisions. The observance of 
ecological safety in a projected activity will be guaranteed by 
the standards, which will prohibit the funding and 
implementation of designs and programs without a positive report 
from the State Ecological Appraisal Service. 
  Ecological requirements will extend to all economic 
activities, including the activities of military and defense 
facilities and the economic operations in free economic zones. 
Stricter ecological requirements will be the only exceptions. 
  The Russian Ministry of Ecology has assigned priority to the 
revision of existing procedures and the development of new basic 
procedures of environmental protection and the intelligent use 
of natural resources in line with current world standards. 
<H3>  6.4. Network of Government Bodies Regulating and Monitoring 
Resource Use and Their Activities </H3>
  There was just as much uncertainty in the system of 
management in environmental protection in 1992 as there had been 
the previous year. One of the reasons was the ``sovereignty 
war,'' just as it had been in 1991. In spite of the signed 
Federation Treaty, delineating the spheres of authority and 
jurisdiction of federal government agencies on one side, and the 
government agencies of sovereign republics belonging to the 
Russian Federation, krays, oblasts, the cities of Moscow and St. 
Petersburg, the autonomous oblast, and the autonomous okrugs on 
the other, territorial officials continued to wield most of the 
influence in environmental protection agencies in 1992, and the 
vertical ties between the Russian Ministry of Ecology and 
territorial environmental protection agencies grew much weaker. 
  The main reason, however, for uncertainties with regard to 
the powers of environmental agencies, especially the Russian 
Ministry of Ecology, was that departments which had performed 
not only monitoring and administrative functions in the sphere 
of environmental protection, but also production-related 
activities (and the number of the latter is now much higher in 
the Russian Federation as a whole), were united in this ministry 
in the form of committees. This is why there was such a strong 
tendency toward their isolation as separate structures. The 
Committee on Geology and Mineral Resources was already separate 
from the Russian Ministry of Ecology at the beginning of 1992. 
  The changes did not end there. On 30 September 1992 the 
president of Russia published Edict No 1148 ``On the Structure 
of the Central Agencies of the Federal Executive Branch of 
Government'' to establish an efficient structure of central 
federal executive agencies meeting the requirements of the 
present stage of radical relations reform and to promote the 
decentralization of authority and the stronger autonomy of local 
agencies. This edict reorganized the Russian Ministry of Ecology 
as the Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection 
and Natural Resources and turned its committees into the Russian 
Federal Forest Service, the Russian Federal Service on 
Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control, and the Russian 
Federal Geodesic and Cartographic Service. 
  The coordination of the activities of these agencies in 
matters under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources was 
to be the job of the Russian Federation minister of 
environmental protection and natural resources. 
  The Russian Ministry of Ecology spent virtually the whole 
year operating without an approved statute (a government decree 
extended the statute on the former RSFSR State Committee for 
Environmental Protection to the Russian Ministry of Ecology, but 
a statute dating back to the time when the USSR was in existence 
was ineffective under new conditions). The adoption of a new 
statute was delayed by the absence of several legislative 
instruments and by disagreements over the functions of the 
ministry in agencies of the legislative and executive branches 
of government. 
  It was not until 18 December 1992 that Russian Federation 
Government Decree No 996 approved the Statute on the Russian 
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. 
According to this statute, the Russian Minprirody [Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources] (a central 
agency of the federal executive branch of government) and its 
local subdivisions are specially authorized state administrative 
bodies in the sphere of environmental protection. 
  The decree listed the following as the main functions of the 
Russian Minprirody: 
  -- the guarantee of comprehensive administration in the 
sphere of environmental protection and natural resources, based 
on the principles of a scientifically sound combination of the 
society's ecological and economic interests and the intelligent 
and nondepleting use of resources, and the establishment of 
environmental standards and permissible limits; 
  -- the coordination of the activities of ministries, 
departments, enterprises, institutions, and organizations in the 
sphere of environmental protection and natural resources; 
  -- the pursuit of a common scientific-technical policy on 
environmental protection and natural resources; 
  -- the improvement of economic, legal, and administrative 
mechanisms in the sphere of environmental protection and natural 
resources; 
  -- the organization and completion of state environmental 
impact studies; 
  -- the organization and exercise of government control in 
the 
sphere of environmental protection and the use of natural 
resources, as well as the observance of environmental safety 
standards; 
  -- the management of natural preserves in the Russian 
Federation, the supervision of entries in the Russian Red Book, 
and the organization of natural preserves; 
  -- assessments and forecasts of the state of the 
environment, 
the country's resource potential, and biosphere processes. 
  Agencies of the ministry underwent virtually no structural 
changes. In summer 1992 the 88 territorial environmental 
agencies of federation members (the federal city of St. 
Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast have a joint committee on 
ecology and natural resources), Arzamas-16, and nine specialized 
maritime boards of inspection under the direct jurisdiction of 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology had a staff of more 
than 15,500 and another 2,000 vacant positions. A random survey 
indicated that the main reason for the personnel vacancies, 
especially in inspection subdivisions and the specialized 
analytical monitoring inspectorates, was the regional shortage 
of specialists and the relatively low wages in territorial 
environmental protection agencies. 
  There were dramatic differences in the size of the staff in 
different territorial agencies: from a staff of 20-30 in the 
majority of autonomous okrugs to 300-400 or more in large 
regions with developed industry and agriculture (the Republic of 
Bashkortostan, Krasnodar and Krasnoyarsk krays, Volgograd, 
Irkutsk, Moscow, Rostov, and Chelyabinsk oblasts, the city of 
Moscow, and others). 
  Government administration of the use and protection of water 
resources, which was the responsibility of the Committee on 
Water Resources of the Russian Ministry of Ecology in 1992 in 
accordance with the Russian Federation government decree, was 
conducted on the basis of a combination of basin-management and 
territorial-administration principles. The protection of water 
resources and the monitoring of pollution in the internal seas, 
territorial waters, continental shelf, and maritime economic 
zone of the Russian Federation had been the job of the network 
of specialized maritime boards of inspection of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Ecology since 1990. 
  This confined the administration of the use and protection 
of 
bodies of water within their drainage basins and guaranteed the 
consideration of territorial interests. 
  In spite of frequent transformations, there were not many 
changes in the structure of the territorial agencies of other 
federal departments connected with environmental protection, the 
use of natural resources, and the guarantee of ecological 
safety. The only new element was the Russian Emergency Early 
Warning and Action System, created by the Russian Federation 
government decree for the definition of the functions and 
coordination of the actions of all state administrative bodies 
and the forces and resources under their jurisdiction in the 
prevention of emergency situations and in cleanup operations. 
  The territorial subdivisions of the Committee of the Russian 
Federation on Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources had 
essentially taken their final form in 1992. Each of the 51 
subdivisions had licensing departments with a staff of 5-7 
workers for the organizational support of the state mineral 
licensing system. 
  The protection of fish resources was exercised by the 
Committee of the Russian Federation on Fishing through 27 basin 
administrations and a diversified network (over 450) of fish 
conservation boards with a total staff of over 12,000. At the 
request of this committee, in 1992 the Russian Ministry of 
Internal Affairs took measures to intensify the struggle against 
malicious offenders and organized forms of poaching. In 
particular, federal budget funds were used to create 150 new 
staff positions in specialized subdivisions preventing unlawful 
encroachments on fisheries. Investigative agencies specializing 
in cases of poaching were created and reinforced. 
  The protection of living resources of the internal seas, 
territorial waters, continental shelf, and maritime economic 
zone of the Russian Federation was the job of 18 specialized 
maritime inspection boards of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Ecology and 10 (of 27) basin administrations for fish 
conservation of Roskomrybolovstva [Russian Federation Committee 
on Fishing]. 
  Government oversight of the fish and other biological 
resources of internal seas, territorial waters, the economic 
zone, and the continental shelf of Russia and the open expanses 
of the World Ocean was exercised by the Committee of the Russian 
Federation on Fishing in 1992. 
  This oversight was based on the basin principle, ensuring 
consideration for the migration of fish and other marine life in 
all bodies of water, irrespective of administrative boundaries, 
in the use of marine biological resources. 
  In accordance with the Russian Federation government decree, 
the reorganized Forestry Committee of the Russian Ministry of 
Ecology became the Russian Federal Forest Service. At the end of 
1992 the structure of this service included eight forestry 
ministries and 13 forest (or forestry) committees of republics 
belonging to the Russian Federation, krays and oblasts, as well 
as 1,426 tree farms and 8,000 forestry associations. The 
protection of forests from violators of forestry laws is the job 
of the State Forest Protection Service, with a staff of 98,700, 
including 56,100 forest rangers directly responsible for this 
protection. 
  The Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight has a 
service overseeing the protection of mineral resources and 
geological surveying, with a staff of around 300. 
  The creation of the network of state cadastral surveys is 
one 
of the main functions the Russian Committee on Land Reform and 
Land Resources is performing in conjunction with other specially 
authorized agencies exercising state control over the use and 
protection of land. The survey on the level of the Russian 
Federation is conducted by the central staff of Roskomzem and 
consists mainly of compilations of oblast data. 
<H5>  6.5. Economic Measures </H5>
  The eradication of the common economic zone, the increasing 
severity of the economic crisis, the destabilization of the 
financial system, the insolvency of enterprises, and the rising 
rate of inflation had a negative effect on environmental 
protection projects. 
  Capital investments in environmental protection measures 
throughout Russia in 1992 from all sources of financing came to 
almost 53 billion* rubles in current prices, which was 20 
percent* below the 1991 figure. 
  The volume of investments in the protection and reproduction 
of flora and fauna was reduced. The organization of natural 
preserves and other territories under special protection cost 34 
million* rubles, which was equivalent to only 7 percent* of the 
expenditures on these purposes in 1991 (in comparable 1992 
prices). 
  The data of Goskomstat [State Committee on Statistics] for 
1992 indicate that most of the investments (over 90 percent) in 
environmental protection measures came from state budgets on all 
levels and the personal resources of enterprises and 
organizations in the state sector of the economy. 
  The reduction of financing resulted in a dramatic decrease 
in 
the number of completed environmental projects. The number of 
completed facilities for the decontamination of waste gases in 
1992, for example, was equivalent to only 68 percent* of the 
number for the previous year. 
  The handling capacity of new sewage treatment facilities 
completed in 1992 amounted to 751,000* m[.sup]3[/] a day, as 
compared to 1.3 million* m[.sup]3[/] a day in 1991--i.e., 58 
percent*. The number of new municipal waste treatment facilities 
was lower than last year's by a factor of 1.7*. 
  There was a considerable decline in investments in projects 
for the efficient use and reproduction of water and land 
resources. The capacities of new water recycling systems 
amounted to 1.382 million* m[.sup]3[/] a day (36 percent* of 
the 1991 figure), and the area of reclaimed land was 4,500 
hectares smaller this year. Units were installed to trap and 
decontaminate 5.6 million* m[.sup]3[/] of waste gases an 
hour, as compared to 8.2 million* per hour in 1991. 
  These lower figures were largely a result of the inadequate 
efforts to institute the new economic-organizational mechanism 
of resource use in the past year, especially on the regional 
level. 
  The organization of records and appraisals of natural 
resources is unsatisfactory in the regions, and there are 
virtually no comprehensive land surveys. There is not enough 
coordination in the study and reproduction of resources, the 
economic regulation of the use of several types of resources is 
inadequate and, what is most important, there is no 
comprehensive management of resource use. 
  The development of the system of environmental protection 
and 
resource conservation and reproduction was impeded by delays in 
the incorporation of economic methods of management in these 
spheres. 
  The few tax benefits that were offered to enterprises and 
organizations for more active efforts in environmental 
protection did little to stimulate these efforts because of the 
negligible savings they represented. 
  Fees for environmental emissions and releases of pollutants, 
waste disposal, and other practices with harmful effects were 
the main effective economic regulator of environmental 
protection efforts in Russia in 1992. 
  The principles of the mechanism for the collection of fees 
for environmental pollution were recorded in Decree No 13 of the 
RSFSR Council of Ministers of 9 January 1991 ``On the 
Institution of Standard Fees for Environmental Emissions of 
Pollutants in 1991 and the Procedure for Collecting Them.'' In 
1992 the document was renewed for a year by Russian Federation 
Government Directive No 50-r of 9 January 1992. 
  At this time pollution fees are being paid by around 46,000 
resource users, irrespective of departmental jurisdiction, form 
of ownership, and property status: for emissions of pollutants 
from stationary and mobile sources; for the dumping of hazardous 
substances in surface and underground water; for the disposal of 
production and consumption waste. 
  The deduction of part of the amount spent by the enterprise 
or organization on environmental protection measures from the 
pollution fee was envisaged to add sufficient flexibility to the 
mechanism for the collection of the fees. Besides this, 
territorial agencies of the Russian Ministry of Ecology 
allocated resources from ecological funds to resource users for 
the financing of construction projects in environmental 
protection and other environmental projects. 
  Differentials reflecting the ecological situation and 
ecological dependence were used to adjust the standard fees in 
different regions of the Russian Federation (2 in Bashkortostan, 
1.29 in Kemerovo Oblast, and 1.1 in Omsk Oblast). 
  Agencies of the executive branch of government in republics, 
krays and oblasts, and the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg 
adjusted fees in 1992 in line with the ecological features of 
different regions and the economic potential of resource users. 
The fees were waived for some budget-carried organizations and 
some subdivisions of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the 
Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Russian Ministry 
of Security, with the exception of the subdivisions engaged in 
economic activity. 
  Officials in Samara Oblast decided that up to 75 percent of 
the fees should remain at the disposal of resource users. 
Enterprises and organizations of municipal housing and public 
utilities, academic and medical establishments, and bakeries 
were exempt from pollution fees in Murmansk Oblast. 
  The sphere of application of standard fees for the dumping 
of 
sewage in Kirov Oblast was expanded by applying lower 
differentials to dumping in leach fields, storage tanks, and 
locations with certain distinctive topographical features. 
Resource users pumping liquid sewage into subterranean areas 
were granted an exemption. 
  In the Republic of Mari El fees were collected for excessive 
vehicle emissions, and North Ossetia instituted a fee for 
emissions from vehicles using natural gas. 
  Statistics for the Russian Federation as a whole in 1992 
were 
the following: 
  -- projected fees: 10 billion rubles; 
  -- fee adjustments: 4.2 billion rubles; 
  -- deductions for environmental projects: 2.6 billion 
rubles; 
  -- fees collected between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 
1992: 4.4 billion rubles. 
  The thinking of resource users had changed between 1990 and 
1992 and there were no more objections to the collection of fees 
for emissions and releases of pollutants and for waste disposal. 
  Standard fees for the environmental effects of radioactive, 
noise, and electromagnetic pollution are expected to improve the 
mechanism of pollution fees. There is a need for an economic 
mechanism of reciprocal settlements for pollutants carried 
across the border, which could be used in the calculation of 
damages in disputes between republics of the former USSR and 
settlements with foreign states. 
  Fees for the use of mineral resources, deductions for the 
reproduction, conservation, and protection of forests, and other 
types of timber fees were instituted in various regions in 1992 
in accordance with resource laws passed by the Russian 
Federation Supreme Soviet. Khakassia, the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia), and Belgorod, Irkutsk, Omsk, and Kostroma oblasts 
have experience in the institution of resource use fees. Fees 
for the use of certain types of natural resources have been 
instituted in all of the republics making up Russia. 
  Pursuant to Section 18 of the Law of the Russian Federation 
``On Environmental Protection,'' a draft Russian Federation 
Government Decree ``On the Approval of the Provisional Statute 
on the Procedure for Issuing Resource Use Licenses'' was 
prepared and forwarded to the Government. The draft was opposed 
by resource departments with no interest in a comprehensive 
approach to resource use. In spite of the absence of a single 
legislative instrument, many regions decided to institute the 
mechanism for the comprehensive licensing of resource use. 
  The Irkutsk Cadastre Center and the State Institute of 
Applied Ecology drafted a plan for the organization of federal 
and territorial surveys of natural resources (or objects) under 
the conditions of market relations. 
  The legal bases of incentives for resource conservation and 
environmental protection are reflected in the Law of the RSFSR 
``On the Protection of the Natural Environment'' (Section 24, 
Subsection 1). 
  It lists the following as economic incentives for 
environmental protection: enterprise profit tax credits; the 
exemption of ecological funds from taxation; ecological 
insurance; the extension of loans to enterprises, institutions, 
and citizens from ecological funds and the accelerated 
amortization of fixed capital. 
  In accordance with Russian Federation Government Directive 
No 
659-r of 5 April 1992, the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Ecology and the Russian State Insurance Company drafted and 
approved a standard statute on voluntary ecological insurance in 
the Russian Federation. 
  The voluntary form of ecological insurance is the best 
option 
today, because the mechanism for creating a state ecological 
insurance fund has not been perfected yet. Budget funds were 
allocated in the past when compulsory forms of state insurance 
were instituted. The allocation of the necessary funds from the 
federal budget to create a state ecological insurance fund would 
be extremely difficult under the conditions of the economic 
crisis in the country and the disparities in the finance and 
credit system. The premiums collected from enterprises, 
institutions, and organizations for compulsory state insurance 
would be included in the overhead costs of production, and this 
could lead to a further rise in prices and inflationary 
processes. 
  Using the standard statute on voluntary ecological insurance 
in the Russian Federation as a guide, the Russian Ministry of 
Ecology worked with the Tyumen Oblast Committee and the Dobryy 
Den Insurance Company on the drafting of ecological insurance 
regulations and defined the basic guidelines of insurance 
operations and prospects for cooperation by environmental 
protection organizations with the insurance company. This 
insurance company is now considering applications for insurance 
on pipelines and oil tanks of the Surgutneftegaz and 
Yuganskneftegaz associations. 
  The Ecological Hazard Insurance Center of the ASKO-Moskva 
Insurance Company has some experience with voluntary ecological 
insurance. This company has insured two pipelines (for 18 
million and 20 million rubles), two oil terminals (3 million and 
6 million), and a joint-stock company (10 million rubles) 
against ecological hazards in line with its regulations of civil 
liability insurance for environmental damage. 
  In the future the Ivanovskiy Ecological Insurance Fund, a 
joint-stock company of the closed type, the Viktoriya 
Joint-Stock Insurance Company, the Triada, Belogorye, and 
Uverennost insurance companies, and others plan to offer 
voluntary ecological insurance (after they have drafted their 
regulations and received the appropriate licenses). 
  During the stabilization of economic conditions in the 
country, the reinforcement of the finance and credit system, and 
the testing of the mechanism of voluntary ecological insurance, 
the feasibility of compulsory insurance can be considered while 
the procedural documents on this kind of insurance are being 
drafted. 
  The development of the actual mechanism of compulsory 
ecological insurance should include the determination of the 
specific branches, subbranches, and enterprises where it will be 
instituted; the preparation of several sectorial procedural 
documents on ecological insurance; the creation of the necessary 
statistical database on ecological hazards, accidents, and 
disasters (and the resulting losses) for at least the last five 
years; the calculation of insurance premiums for different 
fields of activity and objects of insurance. 
  The Russian Ministry of Ecology drafted documents on 
economic 
incentives for environmental protection, including the draft law 
of the Russian Federation ``On Amendments and Additions to 
Russian Federation Laws on Taxation,'' and submitted these 
documents to the government. 
  The law envisages tax exemptions (value-added tax, profit 
tax, and property tax) for extrabudgetary state ecological 
funds, tax exemptions (value-added tax and profit tax) for state 
natural preserves, national parks, and botanical gardens, and 
larger tax deductions for enterprise profits used in 
environmental projects. Measures to provide economic incentives 
for the intelligent use of resources in the future include the 
establishment of higher amortization rates for 
resource-conserving fixed productive assets, the supplementary 
taxation of ecologically harmful products and goods (or work and 
services), the institution of price and surcharge incentives for 
ecologically acceptable products for enterprises and for the 
juridical and physical persons producing goods (or work and 
services) for ecological purposes, and the accumulation of 
ecological bank resources for the crediting of environmental 
projects. Under the conditions of the move to new economic 
relations, the granting of broader powers to agencies of local 
government and self-government, and the atmosphere of political 
and economic instability, the state has ceased to be responsible 
for economic decisions and to serve as the guarantor of the 
economic development of many enterprises. This means that they 
have to find their own ways of dealing with problems connected 
with the institution of market relations. If we consider that 
environmental protection costs were previously funded primarily 
in line with a plan and mainly with budget funds, this factor 
could give rise to uncontrollable negative changes in the 
ecological situation. This could be prevented by developing a 
market for ecological work and services and establishing a 
flexible mechanism of interaction by market structures in the 
environmental sphere, government bodies, and environmental 
protection agencies. 
  There is virtually no regulation of the market for 
ecological 
work and services at this time, and there are no fundamental 
laws and standards governing its establishment and functioning. 
  The market is developing in a haphazard manner, mainly 
through indirect channels connected with natural and secondary 
resources and their deliveries to foreign countries. Ecological 
work and services aimed directly at the attainment of 
environmental protection objectives and the ecologization of 
production have not displayed much development. 
  Meanwhile, several existing and projected commercial 
structures and public organizations are trying to take on the 
functions of monitoring, coordination, licensing, the 
organization of environmental impact studies, and the 
institution of environmental standards, which could lower the 
level of government regulation of environmental quality and 
resource use and result in the monopolization of the market for 
ecological services by structures of this kind. 
  A draft plan for the development of the market for 
ecological 
work and services and documents on the progress in developing a 
market for ecological work and services were prepared and 
submitted to the Committee of the Russian Federation Supreme 
Soviet on Ecology and Resource Conservation. The documents were 
discussed and approved at a meeting of the Supreme Soviet 
committee (Resolution No 56 of 23 January 1992). In accordance 
with this decision, proposals were prepared with regard to a 
program of support for economic activities and the improvement 
of legislation with the aim of developing a market for 
ecological work and services. 
  A special section on ``The Ecological Safety of 
Entrepreneurship and the Production of Goods (or Work and 
Services) of an Ecological Nature'' was drafted and included in 
the comprehensive program for the development of 
entrepreneurship in Russia. 
  The ``Agreement on Interaction by the Russian Minprirody and 
Russian Gosstandart [Committee on Standardization, Metrology, 
and Certification] in Standardization, Metrology, and 
Certification Operations Connected with the Regulation of the 
Use of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection, and the 
Ecological Safety of Products and Technological Processes'' was 
correlated and approved. 
  Several new subdivisions were established for the 
comprehensive introduction of the regional economic mechanism of 
resource use: a resource survey enterprise (the ``Kadastr'' NPP 
[scientific-production association] in Yaroslavl), the 
Scientific Research Center of Resource Surveys (the ``Kadastr'' 
NITs [scientific research center] in Irkutsk), the Scientific 
Research and Coordinating Center for Ecological Safety and 
Market Management (the ``Ekobezopasnost'' NITs), and the 
Volga-Vyatka regional branch of the Scientific Research and 
Coordinating Center of the ``Ekobezopasnost'' NIT's. 
  All of these scientific subdivisions became structural 
elements of institutes of the Russian Ministry of Ecology. 
  In accordance with the Russian Federation government decree 
on the federal ecological fund, the following were drafted by 
the Russian Ministry of Ecology and Russian Ministry of Finance 
and approved following consultations with the Russian Central 
Bank: a standard statute on ecological funds within the 
territory of the Russian Federation and the procedure for 
collecting contributions from enterprises, institutions, 
organizations, citizens, and foreign juridical persons and 
citizens for state extrabudgetary ecological funds. 
  The distributors of fund resources, the procedure for 
collecting and using these resources, and the legal bases of the 
establishment and functioning of the directors and boards of 
funds with the status of juridical persons were determined on 
the regional level in accordance with approved legislative and 
administrative documents. 
  The reduction of resources from traditional sources of 
funding will enhance the role of the ecological funds, but the 
economic difficulties of enterprises, which are affecting their 
solvency, the rapid rise in the cost of work and services, which 
is far in excess of the rate of monetary accumulations in the 
funds, the devaluation of these resources as a result of the 
long time interval between the institution of the fees and their 
collection and use, and the low level of financial discipline 
have reduced the impact of the use of fund resources in several 
cases. 
  The cost of work and services financed by enterprise 
contributions accumulated in the funds--i.e., by the taxable 
portion of the overhead cost of products or the sum paid out of 
enterprise net profits--rose 28 percent in 1991. This removed 
one-third of the profits earmarked for reinvestment from the 
environmental investment cycle, which is unacceptable under the 
conditions of galloping inflation. All of this weakened 
incentives for environmental projects, held up the growth of 
potential credit resources, and impeded the calculation of 
preferential interest rates for enterprise loans. 
  According to statistical reports, the amount deposited in 
ecological funds in the Russian Federation in 1992 was 
7,718,200,000 rubles. 
  The money was used mainly for the following (in 
percentages): 
  -- environmental construction projects--26.6; 
  -- scientific research and design projects--10.0; 
  -- participation in the development of the material and 
technical base of local environmental protection agencies--16.4; 
  -- credits and loans for construction, retooling, 
renovation, 
and capital repairs--5.6; 
  -- monitoring--3.5; 
  -- other expenditures--19.8. 
  Ecological funds in Russia contributed only 3.1 percent of 
their resources, instead of the projected 10 percent, to the 
federal ecological fund. 
  The situation was the following in absolute figures: The 
federal fund should have received around 763.3 million rubles, 
but actually received 158.6 million, or 604.6 million rubles 
(79.2 percent) less than expected. 
  The accumulation of resources and the regularity of 
contributions to ecological funds are being impeded by the 
skewed nature of the legally secured procedure for the 
collection of fees, because it obligates the enterprise to pay, 
but does not provide for the collection of fees by specially 
authorized agencies in the event of the enterprise's refusal to 
pay, which would require the inclusion of a mandatory collection 
provision in the law. 
  This is slowing down the creation of state ecological funds 
based on common principles of organizational management, 
planning, communication between funds on different levels, the 
mechanism of implementation and control, decisionmaking 
procedures, and reliable reports. 
  The information received from 52 regional environmental 
protection committees representing members of the federation 
indicates that 44 state ecological funds have bank accounts and 
only 7 organizations have the rights of a juridical person. 
  The functions of this fund are performed by soviets of 
people's deputies, local administrations, and environmental 
protection committees (Table 6.5.1--see ZELENYY MIR, p 12).

  Besides this, the oversight of fund activities is exercised 
in two cases by environmental protection committees in 
conjunction with soviets and the administration, in six cases by 
the committee and the administration, in two cases by the 
soviets and the administration, and in two cases by all three 
functional bodies. 
  Because the law does not define the specific procedure for 
the payment of fees by enterprises, it would be wise to add a 
description of the mechanism, approved by the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Finance and Russian Federation Minprirody after 
consultations with the Russian Federation Central Bank, for the 
transfer of money by enterprises, institutions, organizations, 
citizens, and foreign juridical persons and citizens to state 
ecological funds. Besides this, the delineation of ownership 
rights to natural resources could serve as the basis for 
legislative definitions of different ratios in the distribution 
of federal property fees among funds on various levels. The 
abovementioned ``Procedure for the Collection of Contributions 
to State Funds,'' drafted with the participation of the 
executive board of directors of the RF Federal Ecological Fund, 
and state statistical report form No 1-Ecofund on the creation 
and use of fund resources, approved by the Russian Goskomstat, 
should reinforce the legal standards and information base of 
fund management. 
  Existing laws and legislative instruments regulating 
privatization say virtually nothing about environmental 
protection. For this reason, in 1992 the Russian Ministry of 
Ecology drafted a supplement to the draft state privatization 
program for 1993, in accordance with which the privatization of 
ecologically hazardous enterprises should be conditional upon 
the completion of programs for the improvement of ecological 
conditions at these enterprises and the creation of special 
ecological sanitation funds. The Russian Ministry of Ecology and 
Goskomimushchestvo [RF State Committee on the Administration of 
State Property] will establish the procedure for considering the 
ecological factor in the privatization of state and municipal 
enterprises in 1993, including ecological appraisals, the 
inclusion of requirements pertaining to the ecological 
sanitation of enterprises in the terms of competitive bidding 
and in privatization plans, the assignment of higher values to 
environmental protection assets, and the creation of ecological 
sanitation funds at enterprises. 
<H5>  6.6. State Environmental Impact Studies </H5>
  Environmental impact studies will be conducted during the 
drafting and substantiation of decisions on the socioeconomic 
development of the country, separate regions, branches, and 
enterprises for the purpose of preventive ecological control and 
the guarantee of ecological safety. 
  They will be conducted by the State Ecological Appraisal 
Service, uniting 88 territorial appraisal subdivisions, the Main 
Administration of State Ecological Appraisals and the State 
Council of Experts on Ecology and Natural Resources of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology. They have a combined 
staff of 650. 
  Territorial and federal agencies of the state ecological 
appraisal network have requested well-known scientists and 
highly skilled specialists in all branches of the national 
economy to take part in comprehensive environmental impact 
studies of various national economic projects. In 1992, for 
example, they enlisted the help of more than 10,000 independent 
experts. 
  Public environmental impact studies must be considered 
during 
the discussion of projects at meetings of the State Council of 
Experts, and the results of these studies are considered at the 
same time as the results of the work of the expert commissions 
formed by the State Ecological Appraisal Service. Meetings of 
the State Council of Experts of the Russian Ministry of Ecology 
and territorial councils of ecological experts have been open to 
the general public and to organizations with an interest in 
specific projects. 
  The distribution of projects considered by the State 
Ecological Appraisal Service in 1992 among branches of the 
national economy was the following: 45 percent in agriculture 
and water management, 38 percent in industry, and 17 percent in 
other branches. 
  In all, the service reviewed 56,000 different documents, 
with 
a combined estimated completion cost of 462 billion rubles (in 
1990-91 prices), recommending the implementation of 70 percent, 
rejecting 9 percent, and returning 21 percent for revisions (33 
percent were not approved in 1991). 
  The Main Administration of State Ecological Appraisals of 
the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology conducted environmental 
impact studies of projects and measures on the federal level 
which could affect the interests of the Russian Federation and 
neighboring states or the interests of two or more republics 
belonging to the Russian Federation and documents substantiating 
the declaration of ecological emergencies and ecological 
disaster zones in certain territories. 
  In 1992 the main administration reviewed 167 different 
documents, including three state programs (with a combined cost 
of 99 billion rubles): 
  -- the Unified State Program for the Protection of the 
Population of the Russian Federation from the After-Effects of 
the Chernobyl Disaster in 1992-95 and During the Period up to 
2000; 
  -- the Russian State Program for the Handling of Radioactive 
Waste and Spent Nuclear Materials; 
  -- the State Program of the Russian Federation for the 
Reclamation of Contaminated Territories in the Ural Region. 
  The main difficulties in the work of the appraisal service 
are connected with the following: 
  -- the shortage of standards and procedural instructions on 
the drafting, coordination, and approval of planning documents 
during different stages of the investment process; 
  -- discrepancies between the requirements of procedural 
instructions and the planning requirements of legislative 
instruments; 
  -- the absence of procedural documents for the 
identification 
of sectorial features of the environmental impact of economic 
and other activity. 
  In connection with all of this, the State Ecological 
Appraisal Service began working on a set of procedural 
instructions for environmental impact studies in 1992, 
specifically for the purpose of establishing more distinct and 
precise requirements with regard to the composition, format, and 
content of materials for the ecological substantiation of 
projects. The Main Administration of State Ecological Appraisals 
drafted the following: ``Temporary Instructions on the 
Ecological Substantiation of Economic Activity in Pre-Planning 
and Planning Documents'' and the ``Temporary Procedure for the 
Submission of Cost Estimates and Payment Invoices for Expert 
Work and Services Performed by the Main Administration of State 
Ecological Appraisals.'' 
  The service also continued its efforts to arrange for the 
advanced training of the personnel of appraisal subdivisions of 
territorial agencies of the Russian Ministry of Ecology, the 
computerization of appraisals, and the development of an 
automated appraisal network. 
  At this time, 61 percent of the appraisal subdivisions have 
been equipped with computers. The improvement of programs and 
the supplementation of the database will facilitate the work of 
the experts. The development of the procedural and technical 
base of appraisal agencies was made possible by the move to 
contracted appraisals in 1992, which are now being conducted by 
67 territorial agencies. 
<H5>  6.7. Environmental Monitoring </H5>
  Several departmental monitoring services are already 
operating in the Russian Federation. The most prominent of these 
are the following: 
  -- the Rosgidromet [Russian Federal Service on 
Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control] service; 
  -- the forest monitoring service of Rosleskhoz [Russian 
Federal Forest Service]; 
  -- the water resource monitoring service of Rosvodkhoz 
[Russian Water Resource Management Service]; 
  -- the geological monitoring system of Geokom [Russian 
Geological Committee]; 
  -- the agrochemical observation and soil pollution 
monitoring 
service of Minselkhoz [RF Ministry of Agriculture]; 
  -- the land monitoring system of Roskomzem; 
  -- the human habitat and human health monitoring service of 
Gossanepidnadzor; 
  -- the monitoring and inspection service of Minprirody. 
  These monitoring services and systems observe and assess the 
state of various elements of the environment and natural 
resources. Each of these systems operates according to its own 
program, which is virtually uncoordinated with other programs. 
  The presently operating environmental monitoring service of 
Rosgidromet is expected to keep records of the physical, 
chemical, and hydrobiological (for water) indicators of levels 
of pollution in the atmosphere, soil, water, and sediment of 
rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and seas in order to study the spread 
of pollutants in time and space, assess and predict the state of 
the environment, and judge the effectiveness of protective 
measures. 
  At this time there is no forest monitoring system gathering 
and processing data on all of Russia's forests. Most of the 
information is collected by the administrators of timber assets 
during the compilation of state statistical reports and during 
forestry research and restoration projects. 
<H5>  [No 26, 1993 pp 4-7] </H5>
  While the majority of European countries now have national 
forest monitoring systems and systems for the regular collection 
of information, the state of forests in the Russian Federation 
is monitored only in Kaliningrad and Leningrad oblasts and in 
part of Tula Oblast. 
  The establishment of a Roskomvod computer network for the 
quick and efficient collection, processing, and storage of data 
and the transmission of data to concerned organizations for 
decisions on branch management is an essential part of the 
monitoring system. To this end, an information program was 
drafted at the request of Roskomvod and distributed to all basin 
water management agencies for the organization of the state 
water cadastre to provide the committee's basin and territorial 
agencies, organizations in the ecological resource field, and 
local executive agencies with reports on the use of water 
resources. 
  The Russian Federation Geological Service has 60 specialized 
hydrogeological and geological engineering units to monitor 
geological conditions. The observation network includes around 
18,000 wells and several dozen test sites for the study of the 
current state of ground water (the depletion of reserves, the 
quality of ground water, the flooding of territories, and the 
salinization of soil), around 15,000 centers to monitor 
dangerous exogenous geological processes (landslides, karsts, 
mud slides, attrition, thermal karsts, and others), and 27 
earthquake prediction centers. 
  The absence of standard monitoring requirements and a common 
set of standards governing measurements and the transmission of 
data gathered during observations creates serious problems in 
the collection and integration of information. As a result, the 
possibility of obtaining comprehensive assessments of ecological 
conditions within the territory of Russia becomes improbable. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology has worked with 
concerned ministries and departments to organize the Unified 
Russian State Ecological Monitoring System (YeGSEM). 
  The YeGSEM was established primarily to obtain complete and 
accurate information about ecological conditions within the 
territory of Russia--information needed by state administrative 
bodies in the sphere of environmental protection and natural 
resources, resource users, and the public. 
  The YeGSEM was established on the basis of existing 
departmental systems for the observation and monitoring of the 
state of the environment, natural objects, and sources of 
anthropogenic influences. 
  This has been part of the general change in organizational 
principles, procedures, and standards and measures, and of the 
creation of a mechanism for interaction by departmental 
services, without any disruption of the existing structure of 
administrative agencies. 
  At this time the Russian Ministry of Ecology is working with 
Rosgidromet, the Russian Minatom [RF Ministry of Atomic Energy], 
and several other agencies on the draft decree of the Russian 
Federation Government on ``The Establishment of a Single State 
Ecological Monitoring System in the Russian Federation.'' 
<H5>  6.8. Environmental Security System </H5>
  In accordance with the Law of the Russian Federation ``On 
Security'' and pursuant to the decree of the Russian Federation 
Government ``On the Creation of the Russian Emergency Early 
Warning and Action System (RSChS),'' the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Ecology drew up a plan for the ecologically safe 
development of Russia. This plan has served as a basis for the 
statute on the ecological safety subsystem of the RSChS, 
designed to anticipate ecological emergencies, disasters, and 
catastrophes and to safeguard the ecological security of the 
population and reduce damages to natural resources in the event 
of such emergencies. 
  The subsystem was based on a set of modules, serving as 
regional links of the ecological security network, in constant 
contact with superior agencies of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Ecology. The establishment of the subsystem was 
begun in December 1992 and has been carried out on two levels. 
  A Main Administration for Ecological Security was 
established 
as part of the Russian Ministry of Ecology, and a federal 
computerized system of information analysis--the Federal 
Information Analysis Center (FIATs)--is being established in the 
State Institute of Applied Ecology (GIPE). On the regional level 
an ecological security module has been established in Arzamas-16 
to serve that city and the surrounding territory, distinguished 
by a high concentration of sources of ecological hazards and 
hazardous technology. The functioning of the ``Ekologiya'' 
regional information analysis center (RIATs) will be tested 
there. 
  The specific structure of territorial links of the 
ecological 
security network will be decided by the corresponding 
environmental agencies on the local level in close interaction 
with territorial emergency management commissions of the Russian 
GKChS. 
  The main functions of the ecological security subsystem will 
be the following: 
  -- the formulation and pursuit of a single state policy on 
ecological security within the territory of the Russian 
Federation; 
  -- the forecasting of possible ecological emergencies and 
their implications; 
  -- the organization and management of a statewide 
environmental monitoring system, using the data of existing 
federal oversight and control services; 
  -- the procedural supervision of territorial environmental 
agencies in emergency situations and in cleanup operations 
following ecological emergencies; 
  -- the organization and coordination of emergency preventive 
services and the cleanup operations following ecological 
emergencies; 
  -- the organization and supervision of the system for the 
ecological protection of the territory of the Russian Federation 
from biological pollutants crossing the border and spreading 
through this territory; 
  -- the organization and supervision of an advanced training 
and certification system for administrative personnel and 
specialists in the sphere of ecological security. 
  The main agency of the subsystem will be the Commission on 
Ecological Emergencies and Ecological Security of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Ecology, headed by the first deputy 
minister. The commission's main functions will be defined in 
line with the objectives of the RSChS subsystem. They will 
include the drafting of recommendations for the improvement of 
the criteria used in the designation of certain territories and 
bodies of water in the Russian Federation as ecological 
emergency zones or ecological disaster zones, the coordination 
and organization of work on the quick and efficient diagnosis of 
ecological problems in specific territories, and the compilation 
of reports in conjunction with the Main Ecological Appraisal 
Administration on the recognition (or nonrecognition) of these 
territories as ecological disaster zones or ecological emergency 
zones. 
  The creation of a functional ecological security subsystem, 
which the country did not have in the past, is certain to 
require sizable expenditures, substantial investments of 
material and technical resources, the training of specialists in 
this field, and so forth, which will entail major difficulties 
now that Russia has entered a complex transition period. 
  The search for alternatives has led to suggestions to make 
use of the potential of existing structures--for example, by 
adapting (or converting) the existing organization of radiation, 
chemical, and biological defense forces of the Russian 
Federation Ministry of Defense. 
  The projected downsizing of the armed forces, which would 
involve not only the dismissal of specialists, but also the 
reduced production of protective, diagnostic, and processing 
equipment and so forth, is another argument in favor of this 
option. 
<H6>  Section 7. Science and Technology in the Resolution of 
Environmental Problems </H6>
<H5>  7.1. Scientific-Technical Development Projects </H5>
  Scientific and technical projects in the ecological sphere 
focused on the formulation of a common scientific and technical 
policy on ecology and were carried out within the following 
basic organizational formats: 
  -- the ``Russia's Ecology'' scientific and technical program 
(Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology); 
  -- state scientific and technical programs in ecological 
fields (Russian Federation Ministry of Science); 
  -- sectorial and intersectorial research and design projects 
(state orders) of the Russian Federation Ministry of Science; 
  -- basic ecological research projects of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences; 
  -- ecological research and development projects of 
departmental research institutes in various fields; 
  -- ecological research projects conducted in Russia's 
leading 
higher academic institutions. 
  The present methods of organizing scientific research give 
rise to major difficulties in the coordination of all of the 
programs pertaining to environmental subjects, in the scientific 
generalization of research findings, and in the move to 
development projects. 
  The ``Russia's Ecology'' program, which was drawn up in 1992 
by the Russian Ministry of Ecology, was intended primarily to 
define the conceptual, methodological, and procedural bases of 
standards, laws, and the economic, informational, and 
organizational premises of ecologically sound resource use. 
Around 400 projects have been carried out within the framework 
of the program, with total funding estimated at 160 million 
rubles. The resulting information will be collated and will then 
be reported to the scientific community. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology also drew up the 
major special federal program known as ``Russian Ecological 
Security,'' the purpose of which is the scientific reinforcement 
of Russia's ecological security during the development of the 
market economy and the establishment of the Russian Government 
by concentrating the efforts of scientists and other experts in 
fields in which the genuine need for certain scientific and 
technical products is already recognized by the future consumer. 
Virtually all regions of Russia took part in drawing up the 
program. Regrettably, the program does not include enough of the 
major projects that should have represented special ``state 
orders'' from the federal government. 
  The scientific research conducted within the framework of 
the 
state scientific and technical programs (GNTP) in ecological 
fields of the Russian Federation Ministry of Science is intended 
to reduce adverse effects on the environment and design 
technologies and processes securing the ecologically safe 
functioning and growth of the branches most responsible for 
environmental pollution. 
  A list of GNTP's with clearly ecological aims and some 
additional information about these programs are presented in 
Table 7.1.1. The purpose of all these programs is the planning 
of a Russian ecological policy to secure the stable development 
of the economy and the establishment and reinforcement of 
ecological harmony, ecological safety, and healthy living 
conditions for the human beings within the territory of our 
country.

  As Table 7.1.1. (see page 5 of ZELENYY MIR) indicates, the 
combined funding for ecological research just within the 
confines of these programs exceeded 3 billion rubles in 1992. 
  The projects produced many concrete and positive results and 
led to the actual implementation of these findings in mock-ups, 
test samples, and experimental models of new equipment, 
technology, and materials. The ``Comprehensive Studies of Oceans 
and Seas, the Arctic Zone, and Antarctica'' GNTP, for example, 
led to new theories about the distinctive features of water 
currents in the coastal zone of the Black Sea, which has been 
exposed to maximum anthropogenic pressure, and permitted 
assessments of the self-cleansing properties of the Black Sea. 
  A map of the regional flora and fauna of the Kara, White, 
and 
Black Sea coastal zones, influenced by anthropogenic factors, 
has been compiled. An ecological monitoring program was drawn up 
for the site of the projected exploitation of oil and gas 
deposits in the Kara Sea for subsequent assessments of 
environmental damage. Problems in international navigation and 
the development of foreign economic shipping were analyzed on 
the levels of theory and practice, the principal means and 
methods of securing Russia's interests in the world ocean were 
determined, and the provisions of the UN Convention on the Law 
of the Sea were analyzed in depth. Considerable attention was 
paid to the problem of the delimitation of sea boundaries and 
the regulation of conflicts in the management of the biological 
resources of the open seas. 
  The ``Global Changes in the Environment and Climate'' GNTP 
calculated the degree of bogging in Russian territories. Studies 
indicated that 40-50 million tonnes of atmospheric carbons are 
combined and deposited in bogs each year, representing 6-8 
percent of the technogenic emissions of carbon dioxide in all of 
Russia. Because of global warming, the combined carbons will be 
released primarily from the shallow peat soils of the forest 
zone, where the processes of bog formation are constantly 
fluctuating. 
  Principles and methods of studying the evolution of soils 
under the influence of global changes in the climate have been 
elaborated. 
  Projections of changes in the Siberian landscape and climate 
by the year 2000, based on the theory of paleoclimatic analogies 
and on calculations of concentrations of carbon monoxide, have 
been published. 
  Assessments of the prospects of the mineral and raw material 
complex and measures for its reorganization at a time of changes 
in the climate and environment will be of great value to the 
national economy. 
  In the sphere of short-term forecasts of changes in climate, 
greenhouse gas emissions and projected emissions throughout 
Russia and industrial leaks of methane were calculated. These 
calculations, which were once based on inventory reports, were 
conducted for all of Russian territory for the first time. 
  The ``Safety of the Population and National Economic 
Facilities in View of the Risk of Natural and Technogenic 
Disasters'' GNTP resulted in the development of probability 
models to assess the risk of accidents and disasters and the 
formulation of criteria and requirements of the survivability 
and reliability of ecologically hazardous technical facilities. 
A report was submitted on ``The State of Geological Conditions 
in the City of Moscow, with an Emphasis on the Territories 
Posing Potential Threats to the Normal Existence of the City,'' 
the first map of the geo-ecological hazards was compiled, 
marking the dangerous and potentially dangerous districts, 
constituting 60 percent of the city's territory, and a program 
was drawn up for future comprehensive geological engineering 
studies for the more efficient use of territory in the city of 
Moscow. 
  The first map depicting ``The Probability of Ecological 
Emergencies Within the Territory of Russia'' (scale 1:800,000) 
was compiled. 
  The ``High-Efficiency Food Production'' GNTP led to the 
development of fundamentally new technologies for the 
cultivation of agricultural crops, particularly the raising of 
rice in ordinary irrigated areas without the costly features of 
traditional rice paddies, reducing water requirements to 
one-fifth of the previous figure. 
  The ``Ecologically Clean Rapid Transit'' program envisages 
the development of models--vehicle prototypes with new types of 
engines, antitoxic devices, and new structural materials, which 
should reduce the adverse environmental effects of motor 
vehicles. A domestic commuter train with speeds of up to 350 
km/hr was tested successfully in 1992. 
  The most significant results of the ``Latest Bio-Engineering 
Methods'' program included a set of regional procedures for 
judging the potential environmental impact by the content of the 
main types of toxic compounds released into the soil and water 
as a result of industrial and agricultural activity. Genetic 
engineering produced strains of bacteria for the degradation of 
organochlorine compounds. 
  One example of a large-scale and highly effective advanced 
development project in the ``Ecologically Clean Power 
Engineering'' program was the study of the possibility of 
building a highly safe nuclear power plant with an average 
capacity of 600,000 kilowatts (electrical) with a water-cooled, 
enhanced-safety, power reactor (VPBER). Nuclear power plants and 
nuclear heat and power substations with reactors of this type 
would be much safer than all existing nuclear power units and 
all of the units being developed currently in the world. Because 
of this, they have aroused considerable interest in the United 
States and several European countries. 
  Scientific research and development projects were also 
carried out in 1992 as part of certain major research and design 
projects of a sectorial or intersectorial nature for the 
development of new generations of equipment, technology, and 
materials to expand the scales of resource-conserving and 
ecologically clean basic technologies. 
  Ninety such projects were financed by the Russian Ministry 
of 
Science's Fund for Major National Economic Problems in 1992, 
with total allocations reaching 340.105 million rubles. 
  The basic ecological research of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences was conducted in a series of pioneering projects, 
despite the suspension of financing for the academy's Biosphere 
and Ecology research program and the sharp cuts in basic 
funding. Priority continued to be assigned to basic ecological 
science, focusing on the resolution of environmental problems, 
the development of theories with regard to the main groups of 
problems, the analysis of scientific, technical, and 
technological achievements and world experience in the 
resolution of environmental problems and the attainment of 
sustainable development, and the disclosure of inadequately 
investigated priority fields (for example, the economics of 
sustainable development). 
  Important results were achieved in many fields of basic 
science. The field of physico-technical sciences and 
mathematics, for example, produced a plan for the safe 
development of nuclear power engineering in Russia. A theory of 
the nuclear safety of fission reactors was formulated. Proposals 
were drawn up on the enhancement of the safety of existing and 
projected nuclear power plants, and groups of computer programs 
(or codes) were developed to analyze their safety. The possible 
scales of the use of nuclear power engineering in the 21st 
century were assessed. 
  A project was conducted for the scientific substantiation of 
a new generation of steam and gas power plants operating on 
natural gas, with a cooling system distinguished by superior 
efficiency and ecological indicators. 
  The plans and technological recommendations for ecologically 
clean technological units for TES [thermal electric power plant] 
with plasmothermal gasification were drawn up. A decision was 
made to build an experimental unit at the Berezovskaya GRES 
[state regional electric power station]-1 (Kuybyshev Electrical 
Equipment Plant). 
  A unique method of protecting the earth's atmosphere from 
freon emissions with the aid of an SHF discharge has been 
proposed. The composition of the products of freon 
disintegration has been defined, and their safety for the ozone 
layer has been demonstrated. A plasmochemical microwave reactor 
is being designed to transform ozone-destroying freons into 
ecologically harmless modifications. 
  Basic plans for waste-free technology in petroleum 
production 
and the extraction of natural bitumen with heat processing and a 
technological power unit for their implementation have been 
proposed. 
  New generations of unique ecological procedures, methods, 
instruments, and systems of environmental control have been 
developed: 
  -- automated analytical systems for the control of the 
ecological state of bodies of water have been designed; 
  -- sonar tracking is being used to study the meteorological 
conditions of the diffusion of pollutants in big cities; 
  -- a highly sensitive, all-purpose gas chromatograph with 
ionization detectors, the ``KhDI,'' has been developed for air, 
water, and soil pollution control; 
  -- a new, highly precise method has been developed for the 
measurement of trace elements of aromatic chlorine compounds and 
dioxins in natural objects with photoionization mass 
spectrometry; 
  -- methods have been developed for the hydrosol-beam 
treatment of the waste gases of TES to remove mixtures of 
nitrogen and sulfur oxides with an electron beam and acid salt 
agents. 
  In the chemical and technological sciences, projects have 
been launched to develop low-waste technologies for the refining 
of oil and gas, the processing of coal, the removal of 
tetraethyl lead from gasoline, the establishment of ecologically 
acceptable pulp and paper production units, and the development 
of intensive (1.3-1.5 times the present rate) biological and 
biochemical sewage treatment systems. 
  A computerized accident analysis system has been proposed 
for 
facilities of the gas-chemical industry to determine the 
potentially most hazardous elements of the technological process 
and to predict the effects and define the causes of accidents. 
  A comprehensive approach to the development of ecologically 
clean fire- and explosion-proof methods of processing and 
disposing of the compacted industrial waste of the 
medical-biological industry and waste agricultural chemicals and 
pesticides have been proposed. 
  Chemical and physico-chemical methods have been proposed for 
the reclamation of land damaged by rocket fuel components. 
  The use of the ``Akromidan-LK'' cation flocculant has been 
proposed for sewage treatment in big cities. 
  Sewage treatment and decontamination equipment using 
accelerated electrons has been developed, and the nature of the 
products of the radiolytic decomposition of organic chlorine 
compounds in aqueous solutions has been studied. 
  Methods have been proposed for the sorption-hydrolytic 
treatment of galvanic waste for the removal of nonferrous metals. 
  Waste-free methods of recycling used catalytic agents 
containing nonferrous metals have been proposed. 
  Years of research have resulted in the proposal of a 
microbiological method of eliminating petroleum pollution in 
water and soil by using hydrocarbon-oxidizing microorganisms. 
The industrial production of the microbe compounds has been 
organized. 
  A bioelectrochemical method has been developed to monitor 
the 
phenol content of different types of water. 
  In the biological sciences, special attention has been paid 
to the analysis and assessment of the present state of Russia's 
biological resources, the elaboration of the scientific bases 
for their intelligent, nondepleting use, the preservation of 
biological diversity, the prevention of the deterioration of the 
gene pool, and the preservation of our natural legacy. 
  A computer database on the biodiversity of ecosystems is 
being compiled. The functional-structural organization of 
ecosystems has been chosen as the priority characteristic. 
  A database has been created for state records of wooded 
areas 
in Siberia and the Far East. 
  Monitoring services have reported that the damage inflicted 
by oil and gas production on just the communities of animal 
vertebrate species in the northern regions of West Siberia 
amounted to 891 million rubles in 1992. 
  The technology for restoring the flora on damaged lands has 
been developed, so that they can be used for economic purposes 
again. The technology uses polymer materials immune to wind, 
water, and heat erosion. 
  In the fields of hydrobiology and ichthyology, a method has 
been proposed for the quantitative assessment of the ability of 
marine ecosystems to withstand anthropogenic influences. The 
degree of deviation in indicators of the state of the ecosystem 
from the statistical norm could serve as the basis for 
calculations of maximum allowable changes in each of the 
monitored characteristics and the overall indicator of ecosystem 
``well-being.'' 
  The most promising regions of the Lake Baykal basin from the 
standpoint of biological productivity have been selected, 
studies have been conducted to predict their ecological state 
under the influence of different types of anthropogenic 
activity, and territories requiring special protection have been 
delineated. 
  A system for the classification of animals has been 
developed 
as the first step in the creation of computerized zoological 
data banks. 
  In the earth sciences, a geological-ecological information 
system has been established for regions of intensive mineral 
extraction and pollution. The system will provide the necessary 
information for decisionmaking during the planning of economic 
activity and the forecasting of technogenic effects on the 
environment. 
  Proposals on the safe use of mineral resources in 
construction and the operation of systems for the subterranean 
disposal of sewage and production waste have been scientifically 
substantiated. A common set of regulations has been drawn up for 
the protection of subterranean regions and the environment 
during the exploitation of mineral deposits. 
  A plan for the safe underground disposal of radioactive 
waste 
has been drawn up with a view to the experience in exploiting 
uranium deposits and with consideration for the colossal amount 
of accumulated waste. The insulating properties of the 
geological environmental and the absorptive capacity of natural 
mineral mixtures used as technogenic geochemical barriers will 
play the main role in guaranteeing radiation safety. 
  An analysis of the ecological state of the seas of the 
Russian Federation was used as the basis for the published 
``Survey of the Ecological State of the Seas of the Russian 
Federation and Some Parts of the World Ocean.'' 
  The basic stages of shelf development in the main climatic 
zones of the earth have been the subject of systematic research. 
Processes of interaction by endogenous and exogenous factors in 
the creation of shelf patterns were summarized and analyzed, and 
this analysis was then used as the basis for ideas about the 
ecological safety of the Russian shelves. 
  The flow patterns and ``lifespan'' of organic polluting 
systems in the ecosystems of the Baltic and Bering seas and the 
southern part of the Chukchi Sea were studied, and the role of 
biological processes in the removal of toxic substances from 
certain parts of the Black Sea was defined. The mutation 
potential of the sediment of the Baltic and Black seas was 
studied for the first time. 
  A mathematical model simulating interaction by forest 
vegetation and the surface layer of the atmosphere was used to 
assess the role of forests in the global biochemical cycle. A 
proposed system of environmental impact studies will analyze 
more indicators than its foreign counterparts and will heighten 
the accuracy of predictions of the possible consequences of 
climatic changes and industrial pollution. 
  A multifrequency transmitter for simultaneous readings of 
the 
microphysical properties of aerosol and ozone up to altitudes of 
20-30 kilometers was launched from a high-altitude sounding 
station for the creation of automated greenhouse gas, ozone, and 
aerosol monitoring systems. It will secure the monitoring of the 
thermodynamic characteristics of the atmosphere and its aerosol 
gas (or ozone) composition in the necessary range of altitudes. 
  Methods were developed to assess geo-ecological conditions, 
and the most common natural and socioeconomic factors 
contributing to crises were disclosed. 
  Regions of Russia were rated in terms of ecological stress, 
and maps of ``Estimates of the Reduced Stability of Regions of 
the Russian Federation'' were compiled (scale 1:800,000). 
  In the sphere of the comprehensive use and protection of 
water, a new plan was drawn up for the management of water use 
in the Russian Federation on the basis of the basin principle. 
  In the humanitarian and social sciences, different 
approaches 
were considered for the country's emergence from the ecological 
crisis at the same time as, and in connection with, the move to 
the market economy. An analysis of the ``command and control'' 
system of government administration and the use of economic 
regulators in the sphere of resource use and environmental 
protection in countries with a developed market economy was used 
as the basis for the planning of the main approaches to the 
establishment of an economic administrative system in our 
country in this sphere. 
  Measures for the institution of economic regulators of 
environmental protection--the system of taxation, the terms of 
credit, budget and extrabudgetary subsidies, ecological hazard 
insurance, and market mechanisms for the self-regulation of 
environmental projects, based on the privatization of property 
rights to different types of resources and the creation of a 
market for ecological services--were substantiated. 
  An analysis of the doctoral dissertations approved by the 
Higher Certification Commission in 1990-1992 provided 
interesting information about the state of scientific and 
technical projects in ecology and the lack of uniformity in 
their distribution among different fields of science. 
Dissertations on ecological subjects, for example, represent 
less than 3 percent (290) of the total number (10,000). More 
than 30 percent of the ecological projects (84) were defended in 
the biological sciences, fewer than 20 percent (50) were 
connected with technical sciences, approximately 13 percent (35) 
were in the medical field, 10 percent (31) were in agriculture 
and veterinary medicine, 5 percent were in chemistry (9) and in 
geography (8), and 1.5 percent (5) were in geology, the 
physico-mathematical sciences, philosophy, and the law. 
<H5>  7.2. Incorporation of Scientific Achievements </H5>
  During the move to the market, the problem of using 
scientific achievements in industrial or agricultural production 
has become a primarily economic problem, and a common technical 
policy can only be conducted by the state through 
supply-and-demand relations. The idea of the incorporation of 
scientific achievements according to plan has to be replaced by 
the idea of ecological marketing and government incentives for 
producers responsible for the ecologization of production. In 
connection with this, scientific and technical achievements in 
the sphere of low-waste technology and industrial waste 
treatment facilities must guarantee not only correspondence to 
ecological requirements, but also a high level of efficiency and 
affordability. In general, the demand for new equipment and 
technology will be shaped on the one hand by ecological 
standards and the conditions of production and product 
certification, and on the other by economic factors. 
  Projects have been conducted for industry, agriculture, and 
medicine on requisitions from enterprises and organizations and 
on an independent basis. Information about the projects has been 
disseminated through exhibits, ecological seminars for 
representatives of various industries, and special conferences, 
and less frequently through reports and news bulletins, the 
press, and television. 
  The results of several new, highly effective ecological 
development projects were made available to industry in 
1991-1992. More than 500 projects were displayed by 200 
enterprises at specialized exhibits. The displays included new 
materials and technological developments, environmental control 
and ecological forecasting systems, and methods of eliminating 
the pollutants of water, soil, and materials. Devices to reduce 
fuel consumption and reduce the toxicity of exhaust, new fire 
extinguishers, and new medicines and medical instruments were 
demonstrated. In addition, there were new means of pest and weed 
control, and the seeds of new strains of plants with heightened 
productivity and resistance to unfavorable influences. 
  The results of dozens of these projects are already being 
used. The drafting of procedural documents on environmental 
protection for various organizations and institutions took 
considerable effort. Scientific and technical documents were 
drawn up for the compilation of the ecological passports of 
enterprises for the purpose of on-site ecological monitoring and 
the planning of ecological measures. 
  Institutes and enterprises working on the development of new 
environmental technologies and equipment continued to maintain 
contacts with scientific institutions and industrial enterprises 
in the CIS countries, primarily Ukraine, Belarus, and 
Kazakhstan. To this end, joint conferences were held, and joint 
procedural recommendations were compiled. Interaction by the CIS 
countries in environmental protection should probably be based 
on the principles elaborated at the UN conference in Brazil, 
particularly the principles of environmental technology 
transfers. 
<H6>  Section 8. International Cooperation </H6>
<H5>  Cooperation in International Organizations </H5>
  In 1992 Russia took an active part in the organization and 
preparations for the UN Conference on Environment and 
Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro. Our state became party to 
the Convention on Biodiversity and the Framework Convention on 
Climate Change that were signed at the conference. Russia 
supported the policy-planning documents of the conference--the 
``Rio Declaration'' (a code of agreed principles of 
international cooperation by states in environmental 
protection), ``Agenda for the 21st Century'' (the strategy of 
global environmental cooperation for sustainable development), 
and the statement on the intelligent use, preservation, and 
development of forests. 
  Russia took part in forming the Commission on Sustainable 
Development (CSD), established by a decision of the UNCED, and 
is now a member of the commission. Efforts are also being made 
within the UN framework to delineate the spheres of authority of 
the UN Environmental Program (UNEP) and the CSD, UNDP [UN 
Development Program], and other organizations in the sphere of 
international environmental cooperation. 
  In the past year Russia helped to advance the all-Europe 
process in the ecological sphere by taking an active part in the 
preparations for the second all-Europe conference, ``Environment 
for Europe'' (Lucerne, 1993). During this process, priority was 
assigned to the drafting of a program of action for the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the compilation of a 
report on the state of the environment in the European region, 
and the reinforcement and development of regional mechanisms of 
cooperation. 
  Within the UNEP framework, Russia concentrated on the 
completion of projects within its own territory. The number of 
these projects was reduced considerably after our country failed 
to pay its membership dues in this organization in 1991-92. The 
remaining programs included ``Controlling the Human Health and 
Environmental Risks of Chemical Substances,'' ``Promoting the 
Use of Ecologically Safe Technology,'' ``Improved Methods of 
Environmental Data Storage and Management,'' and several others. 
  Russia's participation in the activities of the UN Economic 
Commission for Europe (ECE) in 1992 within the framework of the 
Senior Advisers to the ECE Governments on Environmental and 
Water Problems was distinguished by the attachment of greater 
significance to aid to countries with transition economies 
following the political changes in the region. This aid is 
extended through the mechanisms of the corresponding 
environmental conventions, through interaction with the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, through 
seminars on the ecological problems of states with a transition 
economy, and through the planning of projects in this field in 
conjunction with UNEP and other international organizations. 
  Russia's cooperation in the International Union for the 
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1992 mainly took the form of 
participation in drafting the East European program of the IUCN, 
which will be carried out in the form of specific projects. 
These projects are intended to improve the organization of 
environmental undertakings and their legal reinforcement, the 
development of natural preserves, the preservation of flora and 
fauna, the creation of data banks, and the monitoring of 
environmental components. To promote these projects with 
financial support from the IUCN, this organization opened a 
national bureau in Moscow. 
  Draft plans for the technical assistance of Russia were 
prepared and submitted to the Commission of the European 
Communities in 1992. Cooperation was organized with the 
information center of the Council of Europe, and the necessary 
documents were prepared for Russia's projected membership in 
this organization. 
  Interaction with the OECD is also being expanded, 
particularly in the handling of hazardous chemicals and the 
institution of proper laboratory practices in Russia. 
  Efforts to implement the strategy for the protection of the 
Arctic environmental, including the program of Arctic monitoring 
and environmental impact reports, are being reinforced. 
  The work on the plan for the ``Environmental Management and 
Protection of the Black Sea'' has begun within the framework of 
the Global Environmental Fund (GEF). 
  In March 1992 representatives of Russia, Poland, Lithuania, 
Belarus, and Ukraine signed the ``Wigry Declaration'' in Wigry 
(Poland), acknowledging the need for cooperation in the 
protection of forested territories in the border zones of these 
countries--territories of great ecological significance to these 
states and to the whole northeastern part of Europe. In 
accordance with the declaration, a working group was formed to 
draft the joint ``Europe's Green Lungs'' plan. The Russian 
territories covered by this plan are Kaliningrad, Novgorod, 
Pskov, and Tver oblasts in Russia. 
  There were joint undertakings with several World Bank 
missions. A request for a loan of 400 million U.S. dollars for 
ecological purposes was drafted (in conjunction with the 
Ministry of Fuel and Energy). The organizational basis for the 
coordination of the work on World Bank projects in Russia is 
being established. Programs of technical aid to Russia in 
environmental protection through all other bilateral and 
multilateral channels will be managed within the confines of the 
appropriate coordinating mechanism. 
  In accordance with the Agreement on Interaction by the CIS 
States in the Ecological Sphere and Environmental Protection, 
signed on 8 February 1992, the Interstate Ecological Council was 
formed, two sessions of the council were held, and the 
Interstate Ecological Fund was created. 
<H5>  Bilateral Cooperation </H5>
  An intergovernmental agreement on cooperation with the FRG 
in 
environmental protection was signed in May. The work on the 14 
Russian- German projects in this field began in 1992. In 
September a Russian-German ecological bureau was opened in 
Berlin to assist in the preparation and implementation of joint 
Russian-German project plans and the establishment of direct 
ties between enterprises, organizations, and businessmen in the 
two countries in the sphere of environmental protection. 
  Efforts were made to develop cooperation with Northern 
countries. Bilateral intergovernmental agreements were signed 
with Finland and Norway in 1992, and agreements on cooperation 
with Denmark and Sweden were drafted. 
  Cooperation with Finland focused on the completion of the 
intergovernmental Russian-Finnish program signed in May 1992, 
the Program of Measures for the Reduction of Water Pollution and 
the Protection of the Baltic Sea Basin and Other Territories 
Adjacent to the Russian-Finnish Border. The program is aimed at 
the fulfillment of the international commitments the two 
countries assumed pursuant to the Declaration on the Protection 
of the Baltic Environment. To this end, a report is being 
prepared in conjunction with local environmental agencies on the 
state of bodies of water during the 1987-1993 period and on 
Russia's progress in carrying out the program as of 1 January 
1993. Considerable work was conducted on protected natural 
territories in the Republic of Karelia and in Leningrad and 
Murmansk oblasts. 
  The main areas of cooperation with Norway are connected with 
the problem of local environmental pollution by the 
Pechenganikel Combine and the pollution in the Barents and Kara 
seas. A group of experts was formed in April 1992 to investigate 
the possibility of radioactive pollution in these seas. The 
group made the arrangements for a joint expedition to the 
Barents and Kara seas, and one of the members of the expedition 
team was a representative from the IAEA. The results of the 
expedition served as the basis for a preliminary joint report, 
which was presented at an advisory meeting of the London 
Convention on Dumping. 
  In August 1992 the Russian-Norwegian group of experts 
investigated the handling of radioactive waste on ships of the 
nuclear fleet. The members of the group found that the work was 
well-organized and that it was being performed by qualified 
personnel, but they also expressed concern about the failure to 
solve the problem of the long-term storage (or burial) of 
radioactive waste. 
  In September 1992 the Russian minister of ecology and 
natural 
resources was invited to attend a meeting of the Council of 
Environmental Ministers of the Northern Countries for the first 
time in the history of Russia's relations with the Northern 
countries. After the meeting the ministers of Russia, Norway, 
and Finland toured the Pechenganikel Combine and the Kola 
Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences, where they 
presided over the opening of a laboratory which had been 
equipped with contributions from Norway and Finland. They 
reached an agreement on more intense joint efforts in the 
Barents Sea region, including the stepped-up resolution of the 
problem of renovating the Pechenganikel Combine. A joint group 
of experts was formed at Russia's suggestion to draft 
alternative remodeling plans for the combine. 
  Russian-Danish cooperation included preparations for the 
conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement. The Danish 
Government allocated funds for environmental projects in Russia 
with the involvement of Danish firms, which had already done the 
preliminary work of reviewing possible plans for the renovation 
and construction of waste treatment plants in several Russian 
oblasts bordering on the Baltic Sea. 
  A meeting was held with representatives of the Swedish 
Ministry of Environment and Resources for the drafting of an 
intergovernmental agreement. 
  Interaction with the United States on the basis of an 
intergovernmental Soviet-American agreement continued; plans for 
1992 and some plans for subsequent years were approved at 
another meeting of the collective bilateral commission. In 
spring 1992 a second Russian-American expedition studied polar 
bears on Vrangel Island and on the coast of the Chukchi Sea. The 
monograph ``Studying the Ecosystems of the Bering and Chukchi 
Seas'' was published. 
  A plan of operations in five areas of cooperation for 
1993-94 
was approved at the second session of the collective 
Russian-Canadian commission on the environment. Priority was 
assigned to areas of cooperation connected with the protection 
of internal bodies of water from pollution, environmental 
policy, and man's interaction with the environment. The results 
of studies of pollution in the waters of Lake Onega and the Gulf 
of Finland were published and won a Canadian prize for 
excellence in 1992. 
  Russian-Dutch cooperation was developed successfully. A 
joint 
conference was held in 1992 to design the mechanisms of 
interaction by governmental and nongovernmental environmental 
organizations and institutions, and a seminar was held on 
environmental decisionmaking. In addition, a plan for the 
provision of Russia with mobile air quality monitoring 
laboratories began to be implemented. 
  The partners prepared and presented proposals on the 
development of cooperation with France. 
  Environmental protection was one of the topics of a 
Russian-Polish roundtable discussion. 
  Work performed in 1992 will serve as the basis for bilateral 
agreements with China and Mongolia and a Russian-Mongolian-PRC 
intergovernmental agreement on the establishment of a joint 
sanctuary. 
<H5>  International Conventions and Agreements </H5>
  Efforts to fulfill international commitments within the 
framework of multilateral environmental conventions and 
agreements and to draft new international legal documents in the 
environmental sphere continued in 1992. 
  The following were signed on behalf of the Russian 
Federation 
Government: the UN ECE Convention on the Trans-Border Effects of 
Industrial Accidents, the UN ECE Convention on the Protection 
and Use of Trans-Border Currents and International Lakes, the 
Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea from Pollution, 
the Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on 
Biological Diversity, and the Convention on the Protection of 
the Marine Environment in the Baltic Zone of 1992. The 
Declaration on the Baltic Environment was adopted, and a Joint 
Comprehensive Program of Environmental Priority Projects in the 
Baltic Sea Basin was approved. 
  Intergovernmental agreements on the joint use and protection 
of trans- border bodies of water were signed in August 1992 with 
Kazakhstan and in November 1992 with Ukraine. Drafts of similar 
intergovernmental agreements with other CIS countries were 
prepared and submitted for negotiation. 
  The work of the Helsinki Commission continued. A special 
high-level group was formed at its 13th session to carry out the 
abovementioned program and held its first meeting. A special 
working group was organized to investigate the burial of 
chemical weapons in the Baltic Sea basin after World War II. 
  Parties to the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES) met at a conference in March and 
approved a plan of action for the 1993-95 period. 
  The fulfillment of RF commitments stemming from 
participation 
in the Convention on Trans-Border Air Pollution Over Long 
Distances and the protocols to it continued. Emissions of sulfur 
in the Russian Federation were reduced by 41 percent of the base 
1980 level (instead of the 30 percent specified in commitments). 
  In 1992 the Russian Federation Government passed a decree 
``On the Activities of the `Vostok' Meteorological Synthesizing 
Center Within the Territory of the Russian Federation,'' 
securing the necessary conditions for the center's work in 
specific fields of research. 
  Work connected with the Convention on the Prevention of 
Maritime Pollution by Discharged Waste and Other Materials 
continued, and the results of the joint Russian-Norwegian 
expedition in the Barents and Kara seas were summarized. 
  In 1992 Russia fulfilled its commitment to reduce the 
quantity and use of ozone-destroying substances and to conduct 
scientific research and information exchange projects in 
accordance with the provisions of the Montreal Protocol. Other 
commitments were not fulfilled because of the socioeconomic 
difficulties in the country, and the failure to fulfill them was 
reported officially at the fourth conference of the signatories 
of the Montreal Protocol. 
<H6>  Section 9. Ecological Instruction, Training, and Educational 
Information Projects, and the Public Ecological Movement </H6>
<H5>  9.1. Educational Information Projects </H5>
  The news media are still the public's main source of 
ecological information. Around 50 different environmental 
periodicals are published in more than 30 of the country's 
regions. In the other regions, ecological information is 
published in special sections of the leading oblast, republic, 
city, and rayon newspapers. Economic difficulties have resulted 
in the reduced circulation or suspension of environmental 
periodicals in some regions. 
  The specialized central newspapers ZELENYY MIR and SPASENIYE 
and the journal YEVRAZIYA have continued their coverage of 
environmental issues. Because of economic difficulties, 
EKOLOGICHESKIY VESTNIK ROSSII has not been published since 
October 1992, and EKOLOGICHESKAYA GAZETA has gone out of 
business. 
  The newspaper VODA ROSSII, on the other hand, began to be 
published in 1992. It was founded by the Russian Committee on 
Water Resources and the Russian Scientific Research Institute of 
the Comprehensive Use and Protection of Water Resources. Water 
use and protection and water resource restoration projects are 
covered in the newspaper. 
  Ecological problems are discussed on the pages of central 
sociopolitical and literary publications. The percentage of 
environmental articles in IZVESTIYA and KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA is 
quite high. Ecological problems do not receive enough coverage 
in LITERATURNAYA GAZETA and NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. 
  The newspapers have focused attention on the fact that the 
failure to observe existing laws and to implement earlier 
government decisions is the main reason for the country's 
ecological difficulties. They associate the improvement of the 
situation with financial assistance from foreign countries, 
international cooperation, and the scientific research and 
development projects of the public movement. 
  In 1992 the Atom, Kolos, and Ekologiya publishing houses 
published 16 books on environmental topics in editions ranging 
from 500 to 30,000 copies (in 1991 the Ekologiya Publishing 
House alone published 144 new books in a total of 50 million 
copies). 
  Besides this, the Gidrometeoizdat, Znaniye, and Nauka 
publishing houses, universities, and other institutions 
published the works of the institutes of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and its departments, the Russian Academy of Management, 
universities, and academic and scientific institutions in 1992. 
These were conference papers, scientific reports, surveys, 
compendiums, guides, and teaching aids on the most diverse 
aspects of ecology (95 different titles) in editions ranging 
from 100 to 73,000 copies. Three translations of books (from 
English) came out in editions ranging from 400 to 1,000 copies. 
  The state report ``On the State of the Environment in the 
Russian Federation in 1991'' and the Roskomgidromet almanacs on 
environmental pollution warrant special mention. 
  Ecological issues are the subject matter of television and 
radio programs in many of the country's regions. The extensive 
exchange of environmental television and radio programs is 
practiced by television and radio broadcasting companies in the 
republics of the Volga and Ural regions. 
  The protection of Lake Baykal is a constant topic of the 
broadcasts of television and radio companies in Buryatia, Chita, 
and Irkutsk. An environmental television marathon entitled 
``Baykal, Culture, and the Human Being'' in October 1992 was 
organized by the International Baykal Fund of the Buryat 
Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Buryat 
broadcasting committee in conjunction with state and public 
organizations in Chita, Irkutsk, and Mongolia. The donations 
were deposited in the Baykal Fund. 
  Chernobyl is the topic of television and radio programs of 
the Bryansk, Kaluga, Tula, and Smolensk broadcasting companies. 
The Bryansk company broadcasts a weekly radio program called 
``Our Tragedy--Chernobyl.'' Air time in Bryansk has been granted 
to specialists from the IAEA and to German and Japanese 
radiologists offering humanitarian assistance, and there are 
live hook-ups with the chairman of the State Committee on 
Recovery from Natural Disasters or his deputies. 
  Kaluga Oblast radio stations regularly report the radiation 
readings of the oblast sanitary and epidemiological station in 
oblast cities and rayons at the beginning of each month and 
comment on the reports of the statistical administration on the 
food supply and material and technical supplies in the rayons of 
the disaster zone. A 24-hour ``Union--Chernobyl'' marathon was 
televised in Tula. There is a series of ``Channel E'' programs 
on the ecological problems of the oblast in general and 
radiation levels in particular. 
  On a monthly radio program in Smolensk, ``Chernobyl--Lessons 
of the Tragedy,'' participants in cleanup operations, 
inhabitants of the affected regions, and ecologists comment on 
the situation in the oblast. 
  Although television and radio programs dealing with 
ecological issues inform the public and encourage public 
activity, experts believe that the coverage of ecological issues 
by the news media is clearly inadequate and frequently focuses 
only on current events. 
<H5>  9.2. Ecological Training and Instruction </H5>
  The Law of the Russian Federation ``On Environmental 
Protection'' instituted progressive changes in ecological 
education in Russia. Certain elements of the system of 
continuous ecological education (SNEO) envisaged by the law are 
already taking shape. 
  Several governmental and public structures were established 
in 1992 for the creation, development, and coordination of the 
SNEO. A department for the organizational and procedural 
reinforcement of ecological education and training was 
established as part of the Main Administration for Mass 
Information, Public Relations, and Ecological Education of the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology. The Russian Federation 
Committee on Higher Education acquired a scientific-procedural 
council on higher environmental education and a 
scientific-procedural council on safe survival. 
  The Pedagogical Association of Russian Academic Institutions 
for General and Pedagogical Education acquired an 
academic-procedural council on pedagogical training in ecology. 
The Russian Council of Experts on Higher Education acquired a 
new section on ecology and the natural sciences. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology worked with the 
Russian Ministry of Education, the Higher Education Committee of 
the Russian Ministry of Science, and other concerned 
organizations and departments on the draft of a government 
strategy for the development of ecological training and 
education in the 1990s, a draft program of ecological training 
and education for 1993-94, and a plan for continuous ecological 
education. 
  Within the framework of the ``Russia's Ecology'' state 
scientific and technical program, many programs and procedural 
recommendations were drawn up for ecological training and 
education on all levels--from pre-school institutions to the 
advanced training network. The Russian Academy of Sciences 
prepared 20 curricula for schools and pedagogical VUZ's for 
ecology courses and environmental research and evaluation 
laboratories, as well as textbooks and teaching aids. 
  Nongovernmental organizations (the ``School of the Future'' 
fund, the International Youth Initiative for the Protection of 
Nature, the World, and Man, the Ecological Education 
Association, the International University, the Chemical 
Education Association, the Peace and Accord Federation, and 
others) have also been active in coordinating the informational 
and procedural aspects of ecological education. 
  Ecological education in Russia's schools can be developed 
through the ``ecologization'' of traditional subjects or through 
the introduction of a special curriculum. A combination of the 
two approaches is also possible. Priority has been assigned to a 
modular system of information for different levels of ecological 
education. 
  Educational institutions specializing in ecological 
instruction have made their appearance in Russia. These are 
ecological colleges (in Stavropol), academies (in Voronezh and 
Volgograd), institutes (in Stavropol, Barnaul, Yekaterinburg, 
Chelyabinsk, and Moscow), and vocational schools (in Moscow, 
Stavropol, Yekaterinburg, Belgorod, St. Petersburg, and 
Chelyabinsk), as well as ecology classes in general educational 
schools (in Kaluga, Tambov, Moscow, and Perm oblasts). 
  More than 550 institutions of supplementary education in 
Russia are teaching children the fundamentals of ecology and 
biology. The leading institution in the Russian system of 
extracurricular education is the Central Station of Young 
Naturalists (TsSYuN). 
  New educational institutions have been opened--such as the 
academies for young researchers and the ecological training and 
education centers. The Junior Forest Rangers and Blue Patrols 
have become more active. 
  The development of ecological education in higher academic 
institutions continued to take three basic directions: the 
inclusion of elements of ecological education in the whole set 
of academic subjects; professional training in environmental 
protection and resource conservation; the use of ecology classes 
to involve students in research projects and public 
environmental activity. 
  The new integrated subject known as ``Safe Survival'' 
continued to be introduced at all higher academic institutions. 
It is intended to arm students with the knowledge and practical 
skills needed for the development of safe and secure living and 
working conditions, the design of new equipment and 
technological processes meeting current environmental and safety 
requirements, and forecasting and informed decisionmaking in 
emergency situations for the protection of the population and 
industrial facilities from the possible effects of accidents, 
catastrophes, natural disasters, and the use of modern weapons. 
<H5>  [No 27, 1993 pp 4-7, 13] </H5>
  This training would culminate in a special ecological 
section 
of the diploma projects of the graduates of higher academic 
institutions, where the substantiation of the feasibility of a 
particular decision would necessarily include proof of its 
correspondence to ecological requirements. 
  The training of specialists for the ecological educational 
system in specialized departments of 10 VUZ's began in the 
1992/93 academic year. Priority has been assigned to ecological 
education in 100 pedagogical institutes and pedagogical 
universities. Advanced pedagogical training in ecology is 
generally conducted in classes dealing with specific issues. 
  In spite of all of the work that has been done for the 
creation of a continuous system of ecological education, most 
experts question the existence of this system in certain regions 
and believe that the inadequate work on ecological theories is 
the main obstacle. 
<H5>  9.3. Public Ecological Movement </H5>
  In 1992 more than 500 nongovernmental ecological 
organizations (NEO) in the Russian Federation were trying to 
solve environmental problems on the local, regional, 
interregional, and international levels. 
  The activities of the NEO's included the protection of 
animals, specific natural objects, and natural monuments, 
oversight of the observance of environmental laws, environmental 
impact studies, the training of ecological personnel, the 
publication of ecological information, educational projects, and 
other types of activity. The list of applied and 
scientific-technical projects conducted by NEO's is quite long. 
  Many NEO's have focused their attention on the possible 
consequences of the operations of specific enterprises (the 
Balakovo, Kostroma, Rostov, and South Ural AES's, the 
Kochetovskiy Water Engineering System, the Katunskaya and 
Cheboksarskaya GES's, the Balakhna TsBK [Pulp and Paper 
Combine], the Volkhov Aluminum Combine, the Pervomaysk Glass 
Plant (Smolensk Oblast), the Svetloyarskiy BVK Plant, the 
Nadvoitsy Aluminum Plant, and the Khimprom Production 
Association in Cheboksary. A surprising number of NEO's are 
studying the problems of the Alazeya, Aldan, Amga, Angara, 
Bolshoy Irgiz, Vilyuy, Volga, Don, Yenisey, Zhizdra, Irtysh, 
Kazanka, Kolyma, Kubena, Lena, Mius, Ob, Protva, Severskiy 
Donets, Sukhona, Tobol, Ugra, Khoper, Chepets, and Yauza rivers 
and lakes Baykal, Payk-Yarve, and Rubskoye. 
  An analysis of the distribution of NEO's throughout the 
country indicates that they have been formed in all oblasts, 
krays, and republics. There are no nongovernmental ecological 
organizations in the autonomous okrugs. 
  The ``green movement'' in Russia is a new factor in the 
sociopolitical arena and has attracted the attention of 
specialists, the news media, and the population. 
  Nevertheless, in public opinion polls (which will be 
discussed later), 19.4 percent of the experts believed that this 
kind of movement does not exist in Russia, and 72.8 percent said 
that it is not a perceptible sociopolitical force in their 
regions (only 17.5 percent of the respondents expressed the 
opposite point of view, and 9.7 percent were unable to answer 
the question). On the other hand, 34 percent of the experts said 
they supported the ``green movement'' unconditionally, and 35.9 
percent said they agreed with some of its goals. 
  The crux of the problem apparently lies in the fact that the 
purely ecological mass movements (as opposed to political 
movements espousing popular causes) are still in the formative 
stage in our country and have just begun to take action. 
  The level of public concern can be judged from an analysis 
of 
letters to agencies of the executive branch of government. 
  In 1992 more than 16,000 citizens addressed personal or 
group 
complaints to the central staff of the Russian Ministry of 
Ecology. The messages with the highest number of signatures came 
from inhabitants of Krasnoyarsk Kray and Chelyabinsk Oblast who 
were disturbed by radiation readings in the regions of large 
mineral chemical combines, from residents of the Volga zone 
protesting the rising level of the Cheboksary reservoir and the 
flooding of agricultural lands, and from Altay residents 
demanding the completion of environmental impact studies prior 
to the construction of the Katunskaya GES. 
  Letters received in 1992 revealed the heightened activity of 
supporters of Greenpeace in the CIS states and distant foreign 
countries. Government agencies received more than 300 letters 
from activists of the Greenpeace movement in Russia and the CIS 
countries, demanding that the old nuclear reactors of the VVER 
type be shut down. Russian leaders received 600 letters from 
Greenpeace supporters in Australia, Great Britain, Spain, the 
Netherlands, and France protesting the clear-cutting of forests 
in the upper reaches of the Bikin River in Maritime Kray, the 
ancestral home of small ethnic groups and habitat of rare 
species of animals. Some letters from U.S. citizens referred to 
press reports of violations of hunting restrictions protecting 
Greenland seal pups. 
  Letters from people in Russia covered the whole geographic 
range from Kaliningrad to Kamchatka. One-fourth of all the mail 
came from Moscow and St. Petersburg. Many letters were written 
by inhabitants of Altay Kray, Irkutsk Oblast, the Kuzbass, the 
Volga region, the Urals, and the Tatarstan Republic. By 
tradition, the population has been more likely to address 
central agencies than local ones. 
  The suggestions of citizens were taken into account during 
the appraisal of projects for the renovation of large industrial 
enterprises in Moscow Oblast (the Fosfaty Production 
Association) and the Novokuznetsk and Novolipetsk metallurgical 
combines and the drafting of programs for radical improvements 
in environmental conditions and public health in Bratsk, 
programs for the reduction of radiation in the Ural zone, 
Russia's anti-dioxin program, and the ``Russian Ecological 
Security'' program. 
  The numerous demands issued by environmentalists for the 
preservation of forests led to the Forestry Committee's decision 
to separate forest resource management from the industrial 
exploitation of forests. The proposals of citizens were taken 
into account during the preparation of the legislative bills 
``On Natural Territories Under Special Protection,'' ``On 
Resource Use Licenses,'' ``On Natural Resource Fees,'' and ``On 
the Revision of the Russian Federation Administrative and 
Criminal Codes To Institute Stricter Penalties for Violations of 
Environmental Laws.'' The plan for the comprehensive use and 
conservation of Russian water resources up to 2012 was drawn up 
with a view to the proposals of citizens. 
  Many correspondents have stressed that the main cause of all 
of the ecological problems in the country is the general lack of 
ecological awareness, including the ignorance of the heads of 
governmental, economic, and commercial structures. 
  The results of three sociological surveys were 
characteristic 
of the findings of numerous public opinion polls on questions of 
ecological safety in 1992. One was conducted in connection with 
the All-Russian Conference on Ecological Security Issues and the 
Implementation of the Law of the Russian Federation ``On 
Environmental Protection'' (Moscow, 27-29 October 1992) by 
distributing questionnaires to 362 participants: the heads of 
state territorial environmental agencies, maritime boards of 
inspection of federal jurisdiction, and the scientific research 
organizations of the Ministry of Ecology. 
  In terms of composition, the group of respondents met the 
requirements of a panel of experts--individuals whose opinions 
represent the most objective view of the matter in question. 
  From the territorial standpoint, the respondents represented 
the Far East, Karelia, the Far North, the Moscow region, the 
Volga zone, the Northwestern region, Siberia, Tatarstan, the 
Urals, and the oblasts in the Chernozem zone. 
  Most of the experts (65 percent) gave the ecological 
situation in the country an extremely unsatisfactory rating, 50 
percent had the same opinion of their own regions, and 35 
percent gave the same rating to their own communities. 
  Furthermore, 34 percent said that the unsatisfactory 
ecological situation was partly to blame for the sociopolitical 
instability in Russia. In the opinion of 44 percent of the 
experts, this tendency is stronger on the regional level than on 
the national one. 
  An alarming symptom of problems in environmental protection 
activity was revealed when 73 percent of the experts said that 
existing regional environmental services are incapable of 
influencing ecological conditions effectively and blamed this on 
inadequate funding (52 percent of the experts), the absence of a 
developed legislative base (51 percent), the absence of a single 
and complete system for the management and oversight of 
environmental protection and resource conservation (51 percent), 
the shortage of technical equipment (21 percent), the 
insufficient coordination of the activities of environmental 
services and other government agencies (22 percent), the 
shortage of ecological specialists on the staffs of these 
services (14 percent), and the inadequate interest in ecological 
matters on the part of regional administrations and elected 
bodies (29 percent). 
  Around 55 percent of the experts said that the present 
structure of management in environmental protection and resource 
use requires radical changes, particularly in the separation of 
the functions of resource use and monitoring, the establishment 
of a single system for the management and coordination of 
monitoring services, and the improvement of the technical base 
of monitoring services. 
  The overwhelming majority of experts (82 percent) believed 
that natural resources should be federal property, namely: crude 
resources--65 percent, forests--54 percent, land--43 percent, 
all animals--38 percent, and fish resources--33 percent. 
  Around half of the polled experts supported the creation of 
a 
federal ecological inspection service, with 46 percent viewing 
it as a department of the Russian Ministry of Ecology, 7 percent 
saying that it should be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry 
of Ecology, and 29 percent suggesting that it act as an 
autonomous agency of government control. 
  According to 85 percent of the experts, the creation of a 
single ecological monitoring system could do much to improve the 
ecological situation in the country. 
  A survey conducted in spring 1992 in Stavropol Kray, 
Karachay-Cherkessia, Bashkortostan, Buryatia, Yakutia, Karelia, 
Dagestan, and Orenburg Oblast studied the opinions of the 
following specific groups with regard to ecological security 
issues: people's deputies, the personnel of executive committees 
and the news media, members of the intelligentsia, staff members 
of scientific research institutes and higher academic 
institutions, the administrators of state enterprises and 
institutions, the personnel of law enforcement agencies, the 
clergy, and the managers of cooperatives and joint ventures. 
There were 500 respondents in each of these groups. 
  When respondents were asked about the most promising ways of 
improving ecological conditions in populated regions, they 
assigned priority to the replacement of old production units 
with ecologically clean ones and the institution of stricter 
control by local government agencies and the public over the 
observance of environmental laws. The next in order of priority 
were the legislative stipulation of the obligations of 
enterprises and departments to compensate for environmental 
damage, an increase in centralized transfers of funds to local 
budgets for environmental measures, and the closure of all 
enterprises representing potential health hazards in the region. 
Less importance was attached to the institution of independent 
environmental impact studies in regions and the extensive 
coverage of regional ecological issues in the news media. 
  The opinions of the respondents in the ``select groups'' on 
these matters coincided almost completely with the opinions of 
the ``experts.'' 
  One of the disturbing findings of this study was the 
perceptible spread of the belief that regional solutions are 
preferable to national ecological measures. In Stavropol Kray, 
for example, 15 percent of the respondents in the survey of 
special groups suggested that the formation of independent 
republics in Russia would lead to better solutions to ecological 
problems, and this opinion was also expressed by 30 percent of 
the respondents in Karelia, 41 percent in Yakutia, 31 percent in 
Orenburg Oblast, 34 percent in Dagestan, 39 percent in Buryatia, 
41 percent in Karachay-Cherkessia, and 44 percent in 
Bashkortostan. 
  To some extent, these attitudes are a reflection of the 
political and economic confrontation between the center and the 
regions in the sphere of ecological awareness and could be used 
by regional political currents to their own advantage. It is 
quite probable that attempts at the centralized management of 
ecological security will be impeded by demands for the 
redistribution of prerogatives and resources in favor of the 
regions. 
  The influence of the regional structures under the 
jurisdiction of the Russian Ministry of Ecology in the 
development of ecological awareness in their regions was 
questionable and, in the opinion of 49.5 percent of the 
``experts,'' they are incapable of exerting any influence in 
this sphere. The reasons they listed included the unsatisfactory 
training of specialists, the inadequate use of the news media, 
the insufficient funding of projects, the dependence of regional 
agencies on local governments, and the deficient technical base. 
<H6>  Summary </H6>
<H5>  1. Conclusions </H5>
  An analysis of reports on the state of the environment in 
the 
Russian Federation and natural resources in 1992 and on the main 
factors influencing them leads to the following conclusions. 
  The continued pollution of the environment with gaseous, 
liquid, and solid industrial and household waste, which degrades 
the community and jeopardizes public health, was still the most 
acute ecological problem of primary social and economic 
significance in 1992. 
  The decline of industrial production, which exceeded 18 
percent in 1992, was not accompanied by the anticipated 
commensurate reduction in technogenic effects on the 
environment. Emissions of atmospheric pollutants from stationary 
sources were reduced by only 11 percent*, the water removed from 
natural springs was reduced by only 5.4 percent*, and releases 
of hazardous substances in sewage decreased by only 9.7 percent*. 
  Motor transport is playing an increasingly decisive role in 
air quality in big cities. Emissions of hazardous substances 
from motor vehicles increased in 1992. They exceeded industrial 
emissions in 158 cities and represented more than 80 percent of 
the emissions from all sources in 36 cities. 
  In 1992 the level of air pollution in cities and industrial 
centers was just as dangerously high and just as stable as it 
had been in 1991. According to available records, around a third 
of the national population was exposed at least once in the year 
to harmful substances in amounts representing 10 or more times 
the permissible concentration, and around 20 percent lived in 
regions with constantly high levels of air pollution by several 
harmful substances. 
  Because of the reduced annual discharge of large rivers in 
southern Russia (by 10 percent for the Volga and from 15 to 40 
percent for the Don, Kuban, Terek, and others), the substantial 
reduction of releases of harmful substances in sewage in 1992 
did not lead to any perceptible improvement of water quality in 
the majority of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. 
  The state of sweet subterranean water is already critical. 
The total area of sources of constant pollution in subterranean 
waters has reached hundreds of square kilometers and extends to 
70 drinking water intakes, including the water supply in Tula, 
Orel, Kamensk-Shakhtinskiy, Tambov, Ufa, and other cities. 
  The quality of the public supply of drinking water did not 
improve in 1992. In general, around 50 percent of the Russian 
population had to use drinking water which did not meet several 
hygienic requirements. 
  The pollution of marine coastal waters remained at the 
earlier level, with the exception of the eastern part of the 
Azov Sea, the western regions of the North Caspian Sea, and the 
eastern part of the Gulf of Finland and Kursk Bay, where 
concentrations of pollutants were higher. Observations of 
regions of earlier burials and releases of radioactive waste in 
the Barents Sea did not reveal any dangerous radioactive 
pollution of the marine environment. 
  Studies conducted in 1992 to clarify the after-effects of 
the 
Chernobyl accident expanded the boundaries of the zone of 
radioactive soil pollution by cesium-137 at a rate exceeding 1 
curie per square kilometer to 8,800 square kilometers. 
  Radiation readings within the territory of the East Ural 
radioactive track did not change in 1992. 
  The average concentration of radionuclides in the water of 
Russian Federation rivers remained the same in 1992, but waste 
disposal requirements and standards were violated at two 
enterprises. 
  The biological pollution resulting from the accidental 
introduction of animals, plants, and microorganisms with 
constantly expanding habitats and increasing numbers into the 
environment is inflicting perceptible damage on natural 
ecosystems and the evolution of agricultural crops within the 
territory of the Russian Federation and poses a threat to human 
health. 
  The considerable deterioration of the socioeconomic 
conditions of the life of the overwhelming majority of people in 
Russia was naturally reflected in medical and demographic 
indicators, according to which 1992 was the least favorable of 
all the postwar years. The birth rate declined for the first 
time, and to a considerable extent (11 percent), the rate of 
mortality rose (5 percent), and the result was the reduction of 
natural population growth. 
  In addition, negative changes in the public diet, the 
reduced 
availability of preventive health care and medical treatment, 
the heightened social tension in the society, and other factors 
led to a situation in which public health continued to be 
affected adversely by negative environmental factors--air and 
water pollution, impurities in foods, noise, electromagnetic 
waves, radiation, and others. Furthermore, even at their 
previous level, their role was certain to grow stronger under 
the conditions of a declining standard of living, and this is 
attested to by data on the higher rates of oncological disease, 
blood and upper respiratory disorders, complications of 
pregnancy, and other afflictions in cities and industrial 
centers with a high level of pollution in comparison with the 
rate of illness in the same segments of the population in 
relatively clean cities. 
  The monitoring of environmental pollution with substances 
posing the greatest hazards to the human being and regional 
flora and fauna--dioxins, diphenylene oxide, 
polychlorphenylbenzene, organo-metallic and other compounds--was 
still inadequate both from the territorial standpoint and from 
the standpoint of thorough observations in individual cities. 
The monitoring of benzpyrene levels revealed a lower average 
annual concentration, with the exception of six cities where a 
slightly higher rate of pollution by this carcinogen was 
recorded. 
  The pollution of soil with pesticides decreased in the 
Russian Federation as a whole, mainly because of the 30-percent 
reduction in their use in 1992. 
  The dispersion zone of technogenic emissions around 
industrial complexes is expanding. In 1992 these zones covered 
an area of 18 million hectares, and the area of topsoil polluted 
by heavy metals and fluorine reached 3.6 million hectares. 
  One particularly disturbing symptom is the intensification 
of 
soil erosion, which was present to varying degrees on 56 percent 
of all agricultural land, and the area of eroded chernozems 
increased by around 300,000 hectares during the year. Soil 
conservation efforts were reduced, however, in 1992. The area of 
water-logged and marshy land and land suffering from 
salinization, desertification, and other forms of degradation is 
also increasing. 
  A growing tendency toward the reduction of the catch of fish 
in large rivers, lakes, and ponds has been due to the 
unfavorable state of the habitat of ichthyofauna and the 
overfishing of valuable species in recent years. The catch last 
year was 18 percent below the 1991 figure and 30 percent below 
the 1989 figure. 
  The unsound mintai fishing practices in the Bering Sea and 
the unregulated international fishing in the open sections of 
the Sea of Okhotsk have reduced mintai stocks considerably. 
Stocks of other species of fish in the seas of the Far East have 
tended to grow, and the supply of crabs and edible squid and the 
size of marine mammal colonies have remained the same. 
  Stocks of East Baltic cod and the populations of Black Sea 
rosefish and gray mullet are still in a depressed state. Stocks 
of Azov sea roach, sea perch, anchovies, and Azov-Don herring 
were low in 1992. 
  Stocks of Baltic sprat and herring and Black Sea anchovies 
and sprat increased, and the state of some types of sturgeon in 
the Azov Sea was satisfactory. The state of virtually all 
species of semi-anadromous fish in the Caspian Sea was rated 
excellent. 
  In 1992 clear-cutting in forests exceeded 90 percent of the 
total felling area and the area of new stands of valuable 
species. There was still a tendency toward the growth of the 
area of dying forests under the management of the Federal Forest 
Service. Fires have played a substantial role, as well as pests 
and diseases. Efforts to combat these were conducted on less 
than one-fifth of the territory affected by pests and diseases. 
In the last five years, 13 million wooded hectares have been 
lost. This is almost double the area of effective reforestation 
(6.9 million hectares). 
  According to specialists, the regional flora in some parts 
of 
the Russian Federation are in a critical state, but the absence 
of inventories of objects and resources (with the exception of 
forests) precludes an objective assessment in the country as a 
whole and in separate regions. The absence of an effective 
legislative base, policy, and system of governmental control in 
the sphere of plant use and protection is a serious obstacle in 
the intelligent use of the potential of flora and the 
preservation of biodiversity. 
  The state of fauna has continued to deteriorate. The 
population of European saiga and some species of mountain goats 
and sheep have dwindled to a dangerous extent, and the numbers 
of wood grouse, quail, and Hungarian partridge have decreased. 
  The illegal hunting of wild game has acquired dangerous and 
destructive characteristics. The collection of marine 
invertebrates, snake venom, and rare and endangered species of 
animals was conducted without any restrictions or limits in many 
locations in 1992. It is particularly surprising that, although 
illegal hunting was on the rise everywhere, monitoring agencies 
discovered 15,000 fewer cases of poaching than they did last 
year. 
  The decline of the extraction volumes of almost all types of 
minerals, especially petroleum (15 percent), continued in 1992. 
Flames consumed 10 billion cubic meters of gas, just as they did 
last year. Losses of crude resources during the extraction and 
concentration processes remained high, and the rate of complete 
resource use remained low. 
  The network of natural territories under special 
protection--preserves, national parks, sanctuaries, and 
others--continued to grow in 1992. Their establishment has been 
opposed by economic structures, and their territory is 
constantly being reduced by the illegal expansion of local 
government agencies authorizing the grazing of livestock, the 
felling of timber, the appropriation of parcels of land, and 
even the closure of the natural reserves. 
  The dramatic rise in the cost of vacation accommodations and 
travel has alleviated the strain on health resorts. This has 
reduced the amounts of mineral water and therapeutic mud removed 
for consumption and has reduced their pollution in Kislovodsk 
and Pyatigorsk. Nevertheless, the absence of fundamentals of 
legislation on health resorts is having an adverse effect on the 
efforts to stop the degradation of natural surroundings in 
unique therapeutic territories. 
  There were no promising improvements in 1992 in regions with 
critical ecological conditions (the north of the Kola peninsula, 
the Moscow region, the northern Caspian zone, the central Volga 
and Kama regions, the Ural industrial zone, the territory 
surrounding the Siberian oil fields, the Kuzbass, the Norilsk 
industrial region, the Republic of Kalmykia, and the Chernobyl 
zone of radiation pollution. 
  The emissions, sewage, and solid waste of the enterprises 
making up the Norilskiy Nikel concern are inflicting 
considerable damage on the vulnerable ecosystem in the north of 
the Kola peninsula and in Krasnoyarsk Kray. 
  The state of bodies of water in Karelia and Leningrad 
Oblast, 
as well as Arkhangelsk, Sakhalin, Irkutsk, and several other 
oblasts, depends largely on the sewage of pulp and paper 
production units. 
  Ecological and socioeconomic conditions are still critical 
in 
parts of Bryansk, Kaluga, Tula, and Orel oblasts, which were 
affected most by the radioactive pollution resulting from the 
disaster at the Chernobyl plant. There are still urgent problems 
in the organization of economic activity and the restoration of 
polluted territories here. 
  Problems in the establishment of ecological administrative 
structures to improve the quality of life for the population and 
to compensate for the mental and emotional stress caused by the 
Chernobyl disaster and by radioactive pollution in other oblasts 
require further analysis. 
  The main ecological problem of the central chernozem oblasts 
and of Krasnodar and Stavropol krays--the maintenance and 
restoration of the fertility of chernozem soils damaged by 
erosion--grows more acute each year. 
  In Tyumen Oblast, Russia's main oil- and gas-producing 
region, measures to protect the environment are not commensurate 
with the adverse technogenic influences that are destroying not 
only natural complexes, but also the traditional lifestyle of 
small ethnic groups. In 1992 these processes also continued to 
develop in other peripheral regions with an abundance of 
commercial minerals. 
  The deterioration of the hydrological conditions of surface 
and ground water, which have changed under the influence of the 
Gorkovskoye, Rybinskoye, and Uglichskoye reservoirs, is still 
the main problem in Yaroslavl Oblast. 
  The water supply in the Republic of Kalmykia is in a 
critical 
state, and so is the land, which has been degraded by 
salinization, flooding, and desertification. 
  The Ural region and the Kuzbass now have the most 
unfavorable 
ecological conditions in Russia because of the excessive 
concentration of metallurgical, chemical, and machine-building 
plants and enterprises of the coal industry and other extractive 
industries. Their protracted operations have resulted in 
permanently high levels of air, water, and soil pollution and 
have destroyed the landscape. 
  Ecological conditions in the Moscow region are still 
disturbing. 
  An analysis of the environmental impact of economic 
complexes 
in 1992 indicated that enterprises of the coal industry and 
petroleum refining industry paid the least attention to 
environmental protection and resource conservation measures. 
Insufficient measures were also taken by enterprises of the 
timber and wood chemical industry and of the machine-building 
and construction complexes. 
  The operations of elements of the defense complex are having 
a specific effect on the environment, polluting the soil with 
the residue of rocket fuel components, causing the accumulation 
of toxic components of the rocket fuels of old weapons systems 
and supplies of chemical weapons, generating leaks and spills of 
petroleum products, fuel, and lubricants on land and at sea, 
dumping radioactive waste into the Northern and Far Eastern 
seas, etc. The dangerous effects of radiochemical and chemical 
production units and enterprises producing explosive substances 
on the population and the environment are a major problem for 
the defense complex. The ecological mishaps caused by the 
activities of the armed forces and the defense complex are the 
result of the absence of special legislative statutes to 
regulate their activity in line with ecological safety 
requirements and of insufficient control. 
  As a result of the deterioration of technological equipment, 
machines, and mechanisms, of malfunctions, and of the violation 
of technological requirements and regulations by personnel, 
there were more accidents in 1992 at enterprises of the 
metallurgical complex and the agrochemical and building 
materials industries, in the facilities of the Rosneftegaz 
corporation and other oil enterprises, in pipelines, and on 
railroads. 
  An analysis of industrial accidents from the regional 
standpoint indicates that the highest number of emergency 
situations took place in Tyumen Oblast and Krasnodar and 
Krasnoyarsk krays. A significant rise in the number of these 
accidents was also recorded in 13 other oblasts of the Russian 
Federation. 
  An analysis of the reasons for the increasing number and 
severity of major accidents, catastrophes, and natural disasters 
indicated that the main causes were the following: 
  -- the excessive wear of fixed productive assets in power 
engineering, transportation, and industry, including highly 
hazardous production units (the degree of asset depreciation is 
70-90 percent in the petrochemical industry and at enterprises 
of the fuel and energy complex); 
  -- the high concentration of highly hazardous production 
units in small areas; 
  -- the location of industrial facilities in flood and 
earthquake zones; 
  -- the inadequate equipment of units responsible for the 
technical maintenance of modern accident detection and 
prevention devices; 
  -- the absence of economic mechanisms to guarantee safety; 
  -- the absence of an integral set of laws and standards to 
protect the population and territories against industrial 
accidents, natural disasters, and other emergencies. 
  Legislation in the sphere of environmental protection and 
resource use was developed on the federal level and in the 
republics in 1992. 
  The comprehensive fundamental law of the RSFSR ``On the 
Protection of the Natural Environment'' went into force and the 
laws of the Russian Federation ``On Mineral Resources,'' ``On 
Security,'' ``On Land Fees,'' and ``On Amendments and Additions 
to the Law `On the Social Protection of Citizens Exposed to 
Radiation as a Result of the Disaster at the Chernobyl AES''' 
were enacted in 1992. 
  Important legislative instruments were adopted by the 
president of the Russian Federation (edicts and directives) and 
by the Russian Federation Government (decrees) to strengthen 
environmental protection and to define ways of restoring and 
conserving natural resources. 
  The Federation Treaty delineating the spheres of authority 
and jurisdiction of federal government agencies and government 
agencies of the sovereign states belonging to the Russian 
Federation was signed in March 1992 and led to significant 
changes in the efforts to improve environmental legislation. 
  Several of the republics belonging to the Russian Federation 
used this treaty as a guide in drafting their own laws to 
protect the environment and regulate resource use. 
  The declarations issued by several of the republics 
belonging 
to the Russian Federation stipulate that these republics are the 
sole owners of the natural resources located within their 
territory, limiting the effects of the existing Constitution of 
the Russian Federation and of federal laws. 
  The vague wording of statutes, the duplication of powers and 
responsibilities, and the absence of well-defined procedures of 
action in the existing system of legislation constitute the 
prerequisites for conflicts that will complicate the resolution 
of problems in the legal regulation of resource use. 
  The absence of definite guidelines in the system for the 
state control of resource use and environmental protection in 
1992, just as in the previous year of 1991, was due to the 
incomplete process of the delineation of the powers of federal 
government agencies and the government agencies of federation 
members, and also to the fact that some of the departments (or 
committees) of the Russian Ministry of Ecology were engaged in 
production-related operations as well as environmental activity 
in 1992, and this was causing them to strive for autonomous 
status. 
  The statute on the Russian Ministry of Environmental 
Protection and Natural Resources, approved by the Russian 
Federation Government on 18 December 1992, officially assigned 
it the functions of coordination and comprehensive management, 
as well as the pursuit of a common scientific and technical 
policy in this area. 
  In 1992 state environmental agencies on all levels conducted 
work of broad scales on numerous levels, focusing on the use of 
economic methods to regulate resource use and protect the 
environment: 
  -- preparatory work was conducted on the federal level to 
improve records and assessments of resource potential and create 
a network of state surveys of real estate and natural resources; 
  -- the work on 150 regional and special programs in the 
sphere of environmental protection and resource use, financed 
mainly with local budget funds and the ecological funds and 
resources of enterprises, was in various stages of preparation 
and actual implementation; 
  -- fees for the use of natural resources were instituted in 
some parts of the Russian Federation, and the comprehensive 
licensing of resource use was instituted in many regions; 
  -- a standard statute on voluntary ecological insurance in 
the Russian Federation was drafted and approved. 
  Pollution fees were paid by 46,000 resource users, with 2.6 
billion rubles invested in environmental projects and 4.4 
billion deposited in ecological funds. 
  The introduction of economic methods of regulating resource 
use and environmental protection, however, was not enough, 
especially under the critical conditions of 1992 (marked by the 
destabilization of the financial system, the insolvency of 
enterprises, the growth of inflation, and so forth), to provide 
resource users with the necessary incentives to intensify 
environmental protection efforts. 
  Total capital investments in this field from all sources in 
Russia decreased by almost 20 percent in 1992. There was a 
particularly sizable decrease in investments in the protection 
and reproduction of flora and fauna, which represented only 7 
percent of the expenditures on these purposes in 1991. 
  During inspections to verify the observance of environmental 
legislation at 286,000 enterprises and organizations in Russia, 
state ecological control agencies suspended the operations of 
more than 700 shops, assemblies, and installations. 
  Administrative measures were taken against around 38,000 
violators, and criminal proceedings were instituted against 25 
individuals. 
  In 1992 ecological laws were enforced not only by specially 
authorized agencies in the sphere of environmental protection, 
but also by law enforcement agencies, particularly the 66 
environmental procuracies. 
  In 1992 agencies of the Russian Federation Procuracy 
conducted more than 5,600 investigations of environmental cases, 
resulting in the rescission of 1,915 illegal legislative 
instruments and proceedings against 6,300 officials. Internal 
affairs agencies investigating incidents of illegal fishing, 
seal trapping, hunting, and timber felling referred 880 criminal 
cases to the courts. 
  In 1992 all of the state ecological appraisers of the 
Russian 
Ministry of Ecology processed 56,000 designs, programs, and 
other documents. Around 30 percent were rejected or returned for 
revisions (33 percent in 1991). 
  In that year the Russian Federation had eight departmental 
monitoring services to monitor the state of individual elements 
of the environment and natural resources, each functioning 
according to a separate program, virtually uncoordinated with 
other programs. 
  The Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology drafted a plan 
for 
the ecologically safe development of Russia and began forming 
the functional ecological safety subsystems of the RSChS. 
  Scientific projects to solve problems in environmental 
protection and resource conservation in 1992 were conducted in 
line with ``Russia's Ecology'' and 13 other state scientific and 
technical programs with combined funding exceeding 3 billion 
rubles. 
  The ``Criteria for the Evaluation of the Ecological State of 
Territories for the Purpose of Identifying Ecological Emergency 
Zones and Ecological Disaster Zones'' were drafted and are being 
tested. 
  The volume of new, ecologically acceptable technology 
incorporated in industry decreased, however, in connection with 
the economic crisis in 1992. 
  In 1992 Russia participated in the UN World Conference on 
Environment and Development, supporting all of its policy 
documents, and in the second European conference on 
``Environment for Europe.'' Cooperation in international 
organizations and on a bilateral basis also continued. Several 
plans, agreements, and treaties were signed on behalf of the 
Russian Federation Government. 
  The news media are still the public's main source of 
ecological information. Around 50 different environmental 
periodicals were published in more than 30 regions in the 
country in 1992. Economic difficulties precluded the publication 
of environmental periodicals in some regions. 
  Environmental programs on television and radio helped to 
shape public opinion and to encourage public environmental 
activity, but the coverage of ecological issues by the media was 
clearly inadequate and frequently focused only on current events. 
  Many programs and procedural recommendations for ecological 
education and training on all levels--from preschool 
institutions to advanced training networks--were drafted within 
the framework of the ``Russia's Ecology'' state scientific and 
technical program. 
  The first academic institutions specializing in ecological 
education-- ecological colleges, academies, institutes, and 
specialized schools--made their appearance in Russia in 1992. 
  Specialized departments in 10 of the country's VUZ's began 
training specialists for ecological educational systems in the 
1992/93 academic year. 
  All of this indicates that the work performed in 1992 by the 
Russian network of state ecological agencies and services in the 
sphere of environmental protection and resource conservation was 
extensive and multifaceted, and that it was distinguished by the 
increasingly broad use of economic methods of management in this 
sphere, but the unfavorable socioeconomic conditions of the 
period precluded quick and dramatic results. 
<H5>  2. Forecasts and Recommendations </H5>
  The analysis of tendencies toward change in the state of the 
environment and natural resources in 1992 reveals that the 
ecological forecast in the state report ``On the State of the 
Environment in the Russian Federation in 1991'' was accurate in 
general and in the main particular areas. 
  Estimates based on the information in that report confirmed 
the fact that the future ecological impact of production at a 
time of protracted economic crisis would be intensified under 
the influence of the following factors: 
  -- the high levels of constant emissions of the gaseous, 
liquid, and solid waste of production and the increasing 
frequency of accidents caused by the impermissible deterioration 
of technological equipment, vehicles, and waste treatment plants; 
  -- violations of technological requirements as a result of 
shortages of spare parts and materials and the need for the more 
extensive use of substandard raw materials and fuel; 
  -- the reduced investments in the renovation of fixed 
productive assets and in the incorporation of new progressive 
technology and equipment in basic production units and 
environmental installations; 
  -- the reduced expenditures on the operation and maintenance 
of waste treatment equipment, and so forth. 
  Losses of forests due to fires, pests, and diseases will 
probably increase in connection with the acute shortage of funds 
for airborne forest fire prevention services and for the means 
of combating forest pests and diseases. 
  Losses of land resulting from soil erosion are expected to 
increase because erosion will be intensified during the initial 
period of the establishment of private farms in agriculture by 
the shortage of the necessary farming equipment and the 
anticipated influx of people without the necessary knowledge and 
experience. 
  The rights delegated to local government agencies during the 
period when the economic crisis was developing are likely to be 
used more and more extensively for economic expansion by these 
agencies into natural preserves and other protected territories 
for the purpose of hay mowing, livestock pasturing, hunting, 
timber felling, and so forth. 
  The increase in illegal hunting and fishing, the 
unrestricted 
harvesting of commercial medicinal plants, mushrooms, and 
berries, and the trapping of rare and endangered species of 
animals are expected to continue. In the next few years the 
problem of preserving biodiversity will acquire particular 
urgency on the regional and federal levels and will arouse the 
increasing concern of international organizations. 
  The absence of promising signs of improvement in the public 
standard of living, health care, and the resolution of 
socioeconomic problems at a time of permanently high levels of 
pollution precludes forecasts of improvement in the state of 
public health and in medical and demographic indicators. 
  There is no doubt that sociopolitical stability, a strong 
economy, better laws, the strict enforcement of these laws, and 
flexible, precise, and farsighted government control are 
necessary and essential prerequisites for radical improvement in 
ecological conditions in the Russian Federation. It is also 
clear, however, that stable economic development cannot be 
achieved in a country where nature has been mistreated, 
resources have been depleted, and public health has been 
undermined. This is precisely why the efforts to secure the 
protection of natural resources and improve the quality of the 
environment cannot be underrated now, at this time of 
instability and of protracted severe crisis. 
  Enhancing the effectiveness of the activities of 
environmental and law enforcement agencies on all levels to 
secure legality in the sphere of resource use will require the 
continued improvement of environmental laws and the standards 
and procedures pertaining to environmental protection and the 
conservation of natural resources under the conditions of the 
market economy. In particular, it will be necessary to pass new 
water quality laws, laws to protect flora and fauna, clean air 
laws, laws on the decontamination of particularly hazardous 
waste and the recycling of waste products, and others. 
  Reducing the number and severe after-effects of major 
accidents, catastrophes, and natural disasters will require the 
passage of the necessary set of legislative instruments. The 
following would also be advisable means of attaining the same 
goals: 
  -- the reorganization of the existing system for the 
forecasting and departmental monitoring of dangerous natural 
phenomena and the creation of additional systems to secure 
seismic safety; 
  -- the unification of all departmental monitoring systems 
within a single Russian Federation state ecological monitoring 
system set up by the Russian Federation Minprirody and within 
the automated data management system of the Russian GKChS; 
  -- the provision of safety inspection units with modern 
technical diagnostic equipment; 
  -- the reorganization of emergency rescue services and their 
provision with modern equipment to localize and eliminate the 
after-effects of accidents and disasters. 
  The heightened effectiveness of the use of economic methods 
of regulating resource use and environmental protection will 
require the following: 
  -- the calculation and institution of standard fees for 
electromagnetic, radioactive, and noise pollution; 
  -- the quicker approval of documents pertaining to economic 
incentives for environmental protection, including the 
introduction of the necessary changes into existing tax laws; 
  -- the development of a group of measures for the use of 
state tax, credit, and price policies to provide economic 
incentives for the intelligent use of resources, the 
conservation of resources and energy, and the incorporation of 
nonpolluting equipment and technology; 
  -- the acceleration of efforts to improve and incorporate 
economic mechanisms to regulate water use; 
  -- the development of a group of standard fees for the use 
of 
animal resources; 
  -- the Russian Federation Government's quicker passage of a 
decree ratifying the statute on the procedure for licensing 
resource use and the unified Russian Federation system of 
surveys of real estate and natural resources. 
  The following would also be advisable in the near future: 
  -- the drafting and enactment of a statute on the licensing 
of activity connected with high-risk industrial production; 
  -- the drafting and implementation of a special 
comprehensive 
program to prevent the pollution of the environment with dioxins 
and other particularly hazardous compounds; 
  -- the organization of noise pollution monitoring; 
  -- the institution of stricter control over the production, 
distribution, and disposal of particularly hazardous chemical 
compounds, especially halogen organic compounds; 
  -- the drafting and implementation of a state program for 
the 
maintenance and restoration of the biological diversity of flora 
and fauna; 
  -- the coordination of the efforts of federal agencies of 
the 
executive branch of government and the government agencies of 
federation members for the stronger protection and restoration 
of biological resources under their joint jurisdiction; 
  -- the institution of stricter control over the introduction 
of animals, plants, and microorganisms into the territory of the 
Russian Federation and the planning and approval of effective 
measures to localize previously introduced harmful species; 
  -- the coordination of the legal standards and structure of 
state control of the animal kingdom with the requirements of the 
developing market economy and the institution of more complete 
records of the most common species of animals; 
  -- the drafting of additional sections of environmental 
legislation on liability for violations of the rules of natural 
preserves and the institution of state statistical reports on 
natural preserves; 
  -- the Russian Federation Government's quicker drafting and 
passage of a decree on measures to regulate and stimulate 
entrepreneurship in the production of environmental goods and 
services. 
  The following will also be necessary: 
  -- the complete funding of the ``Russian Ecological 
Security'' program; 
  -- the drafting of special federal programs on waste, soil 
erosion, reforestation and forest protection, and others. 
  It would also be useful to draft a long-range program for 
the 
gradual move to international standards for the technological 
processes, equipment, and products with the most adverse effects 
on the environment. 
  An information service should be established within the 
system of the Russian Minprirody for the collection and storage 
of information about the state of the environment and natural 
resources and data on the ecological features of domestic and 
foreign technological processes and equipment affecting the 
environment. 
<H6>  Addendum </H6>
  The state report ``On the State of the Environment in the 
Russian Federation in 1992'' was prepared pursuant to Decree No 
53 of the Russian Federation Government of 24 January 1993 by 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and 
Natural Resources with the help of concerned ministries and 
departments, other state organizations, and the Russian Academy 
of Sciences (RAN). 
  Materials submitted by territorial agencies of the Russian 
Minprirody were used in the state report. 
  The statistical data used in the state report were submitted 
and checked by the Russian Goskomstat--Yu.A. Polenov and V.I.

  This state report is a collective work by specialists from 
43 
ministries and departments of the Russian Federation, the 
scientists of sectorial research institutes, and the scientists 
of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences with expertise in the monitoring and 
analysis of the state of the environment and natural resources, 
the regulation of resource use, the exercise of state ecological 
control over the activities of resource users, and the 
supervision of environmental protection measures. 
  The purpose of the report is the provision of state 
governing 
bodies and the population of Russia with objective, 
systematized, analytical information about environmental 
quality, the state of natural resources, and tendencies toward 
change under the influence of economic activity. The report 
contains information about the legal, organizational, technical, 
and economic measures that are being taken within the territory 
of Russia to protect the environment and conserve and restore 
natural resources and will serve as a basis for the choice of 
priority fields and areas of environmental activity and programs 
to aid in the improvement of ecological conditions in Russia. 
  When the Russian Minprirody was preparing this report, it 
was 
striving to present the most complete and objective description 
of environmental conditions in the Russian Federation in 1992 in 
the interest of ecological safety and stable economic 
development. 
  The specialists who prepared the report, however, are fully 
aware that the information presented in this document is not 
commensurate with the scales and significance of the 
``ecological problem'' and cannot satisfy specialists and the 
public completely. There are several objective and subjective 
reasons for this. We hope that our work on the 1992 state report 
will help us recognize them and surmount them in the future. 
  Nevertheless, the submitted document is an attempt to 
present 
information about the state of the environment in Russia in 1992 
in fairly general and accessible terms and to underscore the 
importance of ecological issues and solutions in Russia today.
