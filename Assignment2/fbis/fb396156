  [Text] A programme to reduce the incidence of malaria to a 
level that will make it cease to be a public hazard is to be 
launched in the Central Region before the end of the year. 
  The immediate objectives of the control programme, among 
others include the reduction and prevention of mortality and 
foetal wastage in pregnant woman by 70 per cent, mortality in 
infants and children by 60 per cent, morbidity due to malaria in 
pregnant women, infants and school children by 60 per cent, all 
in five years. 
  For the same period of five years, the control programme is 
expected to reduce fatality rate due to malaria by 80 per cent 
in all health institutions in the Central Region and to reduce 
malaria transmission by 50 per cent. 
  According to the Malaria Action Plan for the Central Region 
1993-1997, a copy of which is available to the GRAPHIC, the 
campaign will make anti-malaria drugs available and affordable 
to the general population and promote their rational use. 
  The programme will also ensure proper treatment of pregnant 
women as early as possible and make early diagnoses, prompt and 
adequate treatment of malaria cases at all health centres. 
  ``The control programme shall increase the awareness of the 
general population about the risk of malaria so as to promote 
community participation in malaria control activities in the 
context of Primary Health Care (PHC),'' states the action plan. 
  As part of the programme, the use of impregnated bed nets 
will be introduced to all second cycle boarding institutions in 
the region in 1994. The first phase of the programme will last 
for five years and the second segment will start after the first 
phase. 
  The control activities will start in all the 12 districts of 
the region simultaneously and each district will have an 
inter-sectoral committee to supervise the control programme. 
  The action plan prepared by Dr Richard Y. Osei, Regional 
Director of Medical Services, therefore, expressed the hope that 
all communities will co-operate with the eradication team to 
achieve success. 
  In 1992, Cape Coast District recorded the highest malaria 
cases of 24,484 patients representing 23.10 per cent of the 
total regional recording of 102,025 malaria cases. 
Awutu-Effutu-Senya district recorded the least cases of 3,010 or 
2.1 per cent of the regional recording.

  [Text] Guinea worm cases in the country reduced by 46 per 
cent between January and June, this year, as compared to 35 per 
cent reduction recorded for the same period in 1992. 
  During the first half of this year, a total of 13,966 guinea 
worm cases were reported throughout the country compared to 
25,966 cases reported during the same period last year. 
  This is contained in the July 1993 report of Global 2000 
Guinea Worm Project, a copy of which was made available to the 
GRAPHIC at Saltpond or Thursday after a workshop for 35 
guinea-worm eradication volunteers. 
  The report noted that with the possible exception of the 
Northern Region, the number of infested villages is sufficiently 
small enough that a monthly visit by the co-ordinators to each 
endemic village would ensure the adoption of preventive measures. 
  A supplementary report on the Central Region signed by Dr 
Richard Yaw Osei, Regional Director of Health Services also 
stated that the region achieved 100 per cent filter distribution 
to about 42,000 households in December last year. It stated a 
survey carried out in January this year indicated that 80 per 
cent of the population actually used the monofilterment filters 
but 20 per cent were worn out due to vigorous washing. 
  It said 120 endemic communities have been supplied with 
portable water since 1989 while about 130 endemic communities 
have been earmarked for portable water by the end of 1993.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Yves Nau: ``New Cholera Strain Spreading in </F>
Several Asian Countries - Responsible for Several Epidemics''] 
  [Text] In Paris, the latest issue of the BULLETIN 
EPIDEMIOLOGIQUE DE LA DIRECTION GENERALE DE LA SANTE (No. 29 
1993) reports the emergence of a new cholera strain responsible 
for recent epidemics in various Asian countries. 
  Several epidemics of choleraic syndromes--vomiting, 
diarrhea, 
more or less serious dehydration--have appeared in India and 
Bangladesh since the end of 1992. At the time of the first of 
these epidemics, in Madras, specialists were able to isolate a 
germ in patients that did not correspond to any of those known 
to cause cholera. This strain differed from Vibrio 
cholerae 01, the microorganism that causes epidemic 
cholera, and from the other species of Vibrio that 
can cause similar gastrointestinal infections. 
  It was then found that this microorganism is capable of 
producing a choleraic toxin and that it is resistant to numerous 
medicines, with the exception of some antibiotics such as 
tetracycline. Around the beginning of this year, a new strain 
caused a severe cholera epidemic in south Bangladesh (10,000 
cases and 500 deaths). A new epidemic occurred from January to 
April, this time in Calcutta (13,000 cases and 400 deaths), 
striking adults in particular and leading to very severe 
dehydration and blood disorders in patients. 
  It is evident from these indications that a new toxic and 
virulent strain has emerged in the last few months from the 
endemic Asiatic focus of cholera. It has now been named 
Vibrio cholerae 0139 or ``Bengal.'' Unlike the other 
previously known colonies, it directly threatens the entire 
population. 
  Its progression is very rapid, spreading as it did from 
south 
India to east India in just a few weeks. ``This new 
Vibrio will very probably spread in Asia and to other 
parts, affecting first of all the most indigent. International 
monitoring of the spread of this new strain must therefore be 
intensified,'' the General Directorate of Health, in Paris, 
points out.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean-Yves Nau: ``The New Cholera Strain Has </F>
Reached Thailand and China''] 
  [Text] The cholera strain known as 0139 (or ``Bengal''), 
responsible for a new type of epidemic in south and east India, 
then in Bangladesh (LE MONDE 15-16 August), is progressing very 
rapidly over the Asiatic continent, where it has already 
affected thousands of persons and has caused several hundred 
deaths. It has now reached Thailand and China. 
  Isolated a short time ago, Vibrio cholerae 0139 
appears particularly toxic and virulent. Unlike the other 
colonies, it threatens the population as a whole, and in 
particular, adults from Asiatic countries where cholera is 
endemically rampant. The French General Directorate of Health's 
weekly epidemiologic bulletin's prediction that the new strain 
would probably spread among the ``most indigent'' populations, 
has in fact materialized. On Monday 16 August, according to the 
AFP, Chinese health authorities reported some 100 cholera cases 
due to Vibrio cholerae 0139 in Sinkiang, in the 
western part of the country. As of last month, the Chinese 
minister of health had already reported atypical cases of 
cholera in the southern part of the country. The emergence of 
this new strain and its rapid spread worry international 
epidemiologists. In a commentary published in the British weekly 
THE LANCET dated 14 August, Doctors David L. Swerdlow of Boston, 
and Allen A. Ries of Atlanta, fear that this phenomenon will 
result in the eighth pandemic of cholera. Each of the previous 
pandemics resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality 
rates, notably in Africa and Latin America. 
  Cholera is a disease caused by the diffusion in the human 
organism of a toxin synthesized by a bacteria that is 
transmitted by water, food, and fecal matter. Increased 
international travel is today an important factor in the spread 
of this epidemic. As is only too rightly pointed out in the 
latest issue of World Health published by the 
WHO[.sup](1)[/], anti-cholera vaccination is ineffective and 
is no longer required on international vaccination certificates. 
Nor is it recommended as a means of individual prevention. 
  ``Although we may not be able to foretell where and how fast 
this new strain will spread, countries must surveil it closely 
and permanently,'' the American specialists stress in THE 
LANCET. This surveillance requires, in particular, that the 
third world's health officials in their entirety institute 
indispensable hygienic measures as soon as possible by supplying 
the populations at risk with only high-quality water and with 
covered sewage systems, without which the undertaking of a fight 
against cholera remains but a dramatic utopia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed answer to reader's inquiry about the </F>
epidemiological situation in Russia] 
  [Text] As was reported to us in the Russian Federation 
State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, the 
situation regarding especially acute infections in the republic 
is normal albeit rather tense. There are still no cases of 
plague. The situation regarding cholera is more complicated. It 
is generally brought in from abroad: In 1990, 49 patients came 
in from Syria, and in 1992, 5 patients came in from India. And 
this year, 17 patients and carriers of the virus have already 
been registered in Makhachkala, Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnodar, and 
Naberezhnyye Chelny. And 2 cases of cholera disease from local 
sources have been noted in Dagestan and Moscow. 
  The possibility of outbreaks of acute infectious diseases 
remains because there are no real boundaries between Russia and 
the former republics of the USSR and penetration of patients 
from them is possible. The Russian Federation's law regarding 
protecting its territories from the import and spread of 
especially dangerous infectious diseases of people, animals, and 
plants and the plan for such a federal program are still in the 
development stage. 
  Overall, the situation regarding morbidity due to acute 
intestinal infections in Russia remains complicated. Up to 1 
million cases of disease due to acute intestinal infections are 
registered each year because the public is not adequately 
supplied with good-quality drinking water and foodstuffs. The 
situation is especially serious in Russia's southern oblasts. As 
the Rostov Oblast Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight told us, 
four cases of hemorrhagic fever have been discovered in the 
area, and two patients have died. In half a year, 93 diptheria 
patient were hospitalized in the Rostov Oblast (3 died), there 
have already been several outbreaks of diptheria, and the number 
of brucellosis patients has increased by a factor of 5. Everyone 
has long known how to guard against infectious diseases. Wash 
your hands before eating, do not drink untreated water, do not 
eat unwashed fruits...

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr Med Sci Vitaliy Ivanovich Yefremenko, </F>
professor, director, Stavropol Plague Scientific Research 
Institute, by correspondent Aleksandr Bykov; place and date of 
interview not given: ``Cholera on the Doorstep: It Had to 
Appear, Because Conditions for These and Other No Less 
Frightening Diseases Are Being Created''] 
  [Text] An unexpected phone call from Nalchik brought bad 
news. Anthrax was discovered in a certain rayon of 
Kabardino-Balkaria, and several persons had been hospitalized. 
Interrupting his interview, right then and there Vitaliy 
Ivanovich Yefremenko began organizing an immediate trip by a 
team of specialists to the place. All I could do was wait, 
pondering how quickly and simply life sometimes dispels all 
doubts. Just a minute ago I hadn't been fully certain whether we 
really had to discuss unpleasant things like plague, cholera and 
anthrax before readers who are already troubled enough as it is. 
The incident convinced me: Yes, we had to! All the more so 
because Doctor of Medical Sciences V. I. Yefremenko, a professor 
and director of the Stavropol Plague Scientific Research 
Institute, consented to even answer questions that journalists 
were not allowed to ask of such a scientific research institute 
just recently. 
[Bykov]Vitaliy Ivanovich, I must admit that I had 
wanted to begin our conversation with the recent cholera 
outbreak in Kazakhstan. But it seems that we need not go so far 
for examples. 
[Yefremenko]Unfortunately, that's true. The epidemic 
situation is extremely unstable today in the south of Russia, 
and especially in the Northern Caucasian region. A little over 2 
years ago cholera visited Stavropol, and quite recently, 
Krasnodar, Rostov, Makhachkala. We had to fight anthrax in 
Karachayevo-Cherkesia, and now in Kabardino-Balkaria. The 
incidence of leptospirosis has increased in the Kuban region. 
There is a very complex situation regarding brucellosis and 
tularemia--highly dangerous diseases, though sometimes they 
aren't perceived to be so by the layman. Finally, six of 
Russia's natural plague foci are located in the Northern 
Caucasus. Take a look at the map--they're all marked. In the 
Elbrus vicinity in particular, over there, can you see? 
[Bykov]Yes, I see. And honestly I feel extremely 
uneasy. Isn't it like we're living on a volcano? 
[Yefremenko]When epidemiological observation and 
reconnaissance are constantly maintained, when monitoring is 
organized, when disease-carrying rodents are destroyed and 
preventive work is carried out within the population, the danger 
of a plague outbreak is relatively low. In any case God has been 
kind to us for over 40 years. But we shouldn't of course become 
complacent. It is the objective of our institute, and of the 
state sanitary-epidemiological service as well, to take the most 
decisive steps in response to the slightest suspicion. Recently 
for example, specialists had to make an urgent trip to a certain 
eastern rayon of Stavropol Kray, where the body of a man was 
discovered in the steppes on territory that is epizootic in 
relation to plague. As it turns out, the person had been 
wandering, and simply froze. But this doesn't mean that the trip 
and the inspection were unnecessary. 
[Bykov]But this is improbably difficult--monitoring 
the situation on a territory commensurate with the territories 
of certain European states! 
[Yefremenko]Difficult it may be, but our scientific 
research institute, which is one of five Russian regional 
institutes of this profile, exists precisely for the purpose of 
ensuring epidemic safety. That's first. And second, you mustn't 
think that all of the work is done from here, out of Stavropol. 
Plague stations are operating in Novorossiysk, Nalchik and 
Makhachkala, there is a branched network of plague departments, 
and special detachments are working locally. 
[Bykov] By the way, Vitaliy Ivanovich, why are all of 
these subdivisions, including the head institute, called plague 
institutions? Don't you deal with other dangerous diseases as 
well? 
[Yefremenko]This is probably done out of tradition. 
In the past, plague was the most menacing danger, and in 
addition, our institute developed out of a plague station 
established back in 1933. Today we are in fact dealing with 
cholera, anthrax and brucellosis. Moreover life is forcing us to 
join the fight against viral diseases such as influenza, 
hepatitis and others. It was for this purpose that the institute 
organized a virological laboratory. We provide what help we can 
to AIDS prevention centers as well. 
[Bykov]In other words you are widening the front of 
the struggle against diseases, so to speak. But not only are 
they not intending to retreat--on the contrary they are 
gathering strength. What's it worth talking about influenza if 
even newspaper reports about cholera or anthrax have ceased to 
be sensational! 
[Yefremenko]That's all true. But let's think about 
why this is happening. On one hand there are an enormous number 
of people today who are not getting complete, balanced 
nutrition, while some simply don't get enough to eat. Add to 
this the present commonly known woes of our public health, and 
the best possible conditions for growth of disease become 
obvious. But there is another side as well. I am referring to 
the atmosphere of anarchy, all-permissiveness and lack of 
control reigning in the country, sharply intensifying the risk. 
[Bykov]Can you please give an example? 
[Yefremenko]I can give you as many as you want! The 
danger of contracting anthrax has always existed. Its agent can 
survive for a very long time in what is known as its spore form, 
and all you need is to have a rainstorm or a mud flow expose a 
livestock burial site. Before, a sufficiently dependable barrier 
was maintained first by vaccinating farm animals and second by 
inspecting meat brought in for sale and processing. But now, not 
only private owners but commercial farmers are ``economizing'' 
on immunizations, and meat could be sold right on the street, 
without having undergone laboratory inspection. This was 
approximately the scenario of the recent infection of a couple 
of dozen people by anthrax in Karachayevo-Cherkesia's 
Adyg-Khablskiy Rayon. 
[Bykov]So what about cholera? As far as I know it is 
brought to us from far away. Imported, so to speak. 
[Yefremenko]Yes, chiefly from Asian 
countries--Pakistan, Syria, India. But even here we can observe 
disregard for elementary requirements, shortcuts and other 
efforts at ``economization.'' Going abroad, our homemade 
businessmen, whose numbers are now impossible to count, deprive 
themselves of normal life, food and drink in their race for 
profit. Just one swallow of infected water is all it takes to 
bring cholera back to the homeland. By the way, despite their 
large numbers, Muslim pilgrims, for whom normal living 
conditions are created in Saudi Arabia, have never brought us 
any trouble. 
[Bykov]I heard a tragicomic story in your institute 
about two businessmen who had picked up cholera vibrio in 
foreign lands escaping from the hospital in Krasnodar after 
changing their identities. They didn't feel like lying around, 
and so they left to make more money. Do people really not 
understand that we are talking about a serious threat to both 
health and life itself? 
[Yefremenko]Some don't understand. Others follow the 
old Russian ``It'll never happen to me'' philosophy. But there 
are also those who are forced to risk their health and life due 
to circumstances beyond their control. I am referring to 
refugees, who have flooded our region. Poor, deprived of all 
basic necessities, and at the same time actively moving from 
place to place, they are a source of special danger. I'm not 
talking just about the diseases named above in this case. Can we 
exclude, for example, outbreaks of typhus if pediculosis has 
become a common thing? Unfortunately, no. 
[Bykov]Are you saying that what we have here is a 
``risk group'' in the flesh?! And what about the relatively 
better-off strata and categories of the population, who among 
them suffers more, those living in the cities or in the 
countryside? Or can you put the question this way? 
[Yefremenko]In general, disease doesn't ask you where 
you come from. All the more so if you consider the density of 
the migration flows, the high mobility of the entire population, 
and the transparency of the borders. But if we consider the 
personal or domestic level, then a herder working within a 
natural plague focus risks more than an urban dweller. Though 
less than a careless, poorly equipped tourist. Country dwellers 
probably also have a greater risk of anthrax infection because 
they work with farm animals. However, infected meat could be 
sold in the city as well. Perhaps the only uncontested ``rural'' 
disease is brucellosis. Rural inhabitants should protect 
themselves from it especially carefully, and not treat it as 
something harmless. A frightening disease! 
[Bykov]Does your warning mean that saving the 
drowning is a task primarily of the drowning themselves? 
[Yefremenko]There's nothing wrong with being extra 
cautious. Or with listening to the advice of specialists. Though 
of course they may also label immunizations as a bad thing. But 
then there's no reason to be amazed that the number of cases of, 
let us say, diphtheria is growing. However, despite all of this, 
prevention of dangerous diseases, efficient detection of sources 
and foci, treatment of patients and prevention of epidemics are 
naturally national tasks. And it is no accident that we are now 
developing a regional program against especially dangerous 
infections encompassing all of the south of Russia. We are also 
raising the question of organizationally unifying the plague 
service with the sanitary-epidemiological service. But we, like 
everyone else, have many problems. 
[Bykov]Money? 
[Yefremenko]Not just that, although financing is one 
of the most painful issues. Consider what seems like a simple 
thing--an on-site visit by our specialists. This has become 
simply dangerous to life when it comes to Chechen, Ingushetia or 
Northern Ossetia. Nonetheless, believe me, we aren't sitting 
idle. The institute does have a rather considerable potential. 
[Bykov]Can we talk a little about something else? Our 
interview has taken such a morose turn. 
[Yefremenko]Well, there isn't much to be happy about. 
But as far as the institute is concerned, it would be hard of 
course to describe its work in just a few words. You would 
probably be interested for example that an international 
reference center of the World Health Organization works in the 
institute. It has an extensive data bank on plague covering 
Asian and a number of European countries. There are also three 
other centers--a detection center, a center for zoonoses of the 
south of Russia, and a training center that prepares personnel 
for the CIS. Our collection of fleas--plague vectors--is second 
in importance in the world, the first being in England. Without 
going into the names of all of the divisions and laboratories, 
let me note that research is being conducted at a respectable 
level. In particular, we are working on pharmaceuticals of a new 
generation that surmount the cellular barrier; we have started 
production of diagnostic material based on magnosorbents making 
it possible to detect an infection source efficiently and 
precisely. In short, no matter how dangerous diseases might be, 
we are in no way defenseless against them. 
[Bykov]Well, let's end on this note, wishing success 
to the people whose work is discussed in the papers far more 
rarely than the outbreaks of the frightening diseases they 
fight. And health to all in our unfortunately dangerous times.

Government, ``Cuba and Tajikistan Offering Humanitarian 
Assistance to Moscow''] 
  [Text] CIS and other countries throughout the world are 
providing emergency assistance to Moscow clinics which accepted 
for treatment the persons injured on 3-4 October. 
  Here are some reports from the dispatches of the Commission 
on the Issues of Humanitarian and Technical Assistance at the 
Russian Federation Government. Tajikistan, despite its own 
misfortunes, sent approximately 50 t of canned juices to Moscow 
(apricot, grape, and pomegranate) and 40 t of fresh tomatoes, 
grapes, and watermelons which will be sent directly to the 
capital's hospitals. 
  Although it may appear strange, but the list of ``donor'' 
countries who responded to the Moscow tragedy include Cuba and 
Ethiopia. Fidel Castro, in particular, promised to send plasma 
and drugs, while the Russian Federation Embassy in Ethiopia and 
the Red Cross hospital are sending 400 dressing and bandage kits 
and 150 catheters for the military hospital in Balashikha which 
is treating soldiers from the Dzerzhinskiy division. 
  As always, the European Community did not stand idle; its 
assistance amounted to 300,000 ECUs. In addition, Moscow 
physicians will receive drugs and preparations from governments 
and philanthropic organizations in Denmark, Turkey, Switzerland, 
Italy, France... 
  The Russian Peace Fund sent 5 million rubles as assistance 
to 
Moscow's first-aid workers--physicians, nursing aides, and 
ambulance crew drivers who were the first to give assistance to 
the wounded during the tragic days of October. In addition to 
money, family members of the ambulance workers who have children 
will receive toys and gifts. 
  The fund has specific addresses and lists of persons and 
crews who bravely and without fear of danger worked under the 
hail of bullets on 3-4 October. 
  The Russian Peace Fund is appealing to the leaders of 
enterprises, commercial structures, associations, and banks to 
join them in this charitable action and transfer funds to 
Account No. 705001 with a notation ``First Aid'' at the Orbita 
Commercial Bank, Correspondent Account No. 161227 at the Russian 
Commercial Center of the Main Administration of the Russian 
Federation Central Bank, Ministry of Finance, 201791.

Eating and Cholera Will Not Scare You''; first two paragraphs

  [Text] Moscow continues to worry: Is cholera an 
accidental guest here? Who is that mysterious vagrant, a carrier 
of the virus? Have they found the sources of the infection? 
  We were able to get in touch with Ludmilla Alekseyeva, 
one of the chief specialists at Moscow's 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Station. 
  ``The vagrant came here by chance,'' said Ludmilla 
Alekseyeva. ``He has been in Moscow since 1989 and has no 
documents. Where he lived is unknown. He spent 12 years in 
prison, and all his clothes were pinned together. A Moscow 
chauffeur hired him to guard his car while it was being 
repaired. The vagrant was ill for a week without going to the 
hospital. But when he became much worse and began vomiting, the 
chauffeur called the ambulance.'' 
  At the infectious disease hospital, cholera was suspected 
immediately. An experienced professor was consulted. The 
examination confirmed the initial diagnosis. The patient is now 
in a special department and is recovering. The unfortunate 
chauffeur is also in the hospital but is, thank God, healthy.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Anishchenko] </F>
  [Text] Last year, we broke the European record in the 
incidence of diphtheria: 120 of our countrymen died from this 
disease. Compared to the same period last year, today the number 
of diphtheria patients has increased further by 2.5 times. 
  Reports about other infections are equally as troubling. One 
of the principal reasons for this situation is a tenfold 
increase in the number of citizens refusing preventive 
vaccination. 
  Speaking at a physicians' seminar at the Information and 
Analytical Center of Russia's Sanitary Oversight a year ago, one 
of the world luminaries in the field of epidemiology, Artur 
Galasko, noted with alarm that the antivaccination campaign had 
already inflicted serious harm on children vaccination efforts: 
60% of our adolescent generation has dropped out of the 
vaccination schedule to which all civilized world strictly 
adheres. 
  One should not be surprised by this. In medical 
cooperatives, 
``kind Dr. Doolittles'' guarantee that the toddlers will be 
immune to any infection without any painful procedures with the 
help of drawing up a certain genetic chart. And whose mother 
would refuse such an offer?! We should acknowledge that the 
well-wishers do admit that sometimes vaccination is necessary 
and in this case promise to use not the poisonous ``Soviet 
vaccine'' but pure foreign stuff, even if purchased for hard 
currency. 
  For example, it is often mentioned that domestic 
antidiphtheria vaccine has a harmful substance--mertiolate. 
Indeed, the word mertiolate does not appear in the note to the 
French antidiphtheria vaccine by the Pasteur-Millet Company. The 
reason is simple: the same compound and in the same 
concentration as here figures in the French preparation under 
another name--thiomersale. Scientists have attempted to identify 
the harmful effect of this substance under experimental 
conditions, yet even when laboratory animals were injected with 
a dose exceeding that given to humans during vaccination by 
4,000 times, no deviation from the norm was detected. 
  People who indeed have serious immunity deficiencies and for 
whom standard vaccine is fraught with complications number 
approximately 1.5-2% of the total population. In order to 
identify them among the rest, reliable criteria are available: 
certain external symptoms, data on the child development 
history, or disease of a certain organ. All these ``alarm 
signals'' are recorded in a special list of contraindications to 
vaccination which each epidemiologist and every district 
pediatrician must follow as faithfully as a faithful Muslim 
follows the teachings of the prophet. If someone displays at 
least one symptom of partial immune deficiency, this person is 
directed to a cytologic blood analysis and is given a special 
mild inoculation which does not cause complications under any 
circumstances. 
  History attests how in the 1970s the British gave up for a 
time mandatory whooping cough vaccination, and an epidemic broke 
out in the country. In order to remediate the consequences of 
this omission, the British Government was forced to allocate 
considerable amounts of money. Today, financial stimuli exist in 
the United Kingdom for physicians who have achieved complete 
vaccination of population in areas where they practice. Here, we 
have not yet reached an epidemic stage. Yet a dangerous growth 
of infectious morbidity and mortality is already underway. And 
if the system of mandatory population vaccination finally breaks 
down, the Russians will be deprived of one of the few remaining 
social guarantees--protection from wholesale epidemics.

  [Text] We have been informed by the Russian Federation 
State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight that as a 
result of numerous accidents in the water supply system in the 
town of Volgodonsk (Rostov oblast), a number of people were 
infected with typhoid fever. One hundred fifty-three persons 
were hospitalized in Volgodonsk treatment facilities. The 
diagnosis was confirmed in 51 persons while the others are 
suspected of having typhoid fever. The diagnosis is confirmed in 
17 of the hospitalized children. Today, antiepidemic measures 
are being taken by experts from the Oblast 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight Center and the town's 
infection service. A team from Russia's Information Analysis 
Center left for Volgodonsk. During the first six months of this 
year, 315 cases of typhoid fever were recorded in Russia whereas 
the number during the same period in 1992 was 200.

Zarovskiy, staff reporter] 
  [Text] A high level of scabies and diphtheria incidence has 
been reported in St. Petersburg. We should state though that the 
chief expert of the St. Petersburg Sanitary-Epidemiological 
Oversight, Oleg Parkov, denied in an interview with the NK-Press 
Agency rumors about an epidemic allegedly breaking out in the 
city. At the same time, he stated that in July 1993 alone, 333 
scabies patients were recorded in the city. Of these, 74 are 
children under the age of 14. The situation is further 
complicated in that there is a catastrophic shortage of drugs in 
the city. 
  As for diphtheria, St. Petersburg is ahead in the number of 
patients and morbidity among Russian cities. In July alone, 158 
cases of diphtheria were recorded; of these, eight patients have 
died. 
  The first cases of diphtheria were recorded in Lithuania 
this 
year. A mother and daughter from Kaunas became ill on 2 Aug but 
sought a physician's help only four days later. The girl who is 
in a critical condition is in the resuscitation department. 
There are speculations that she was infected by relatives from 
St. Petersburg.

  [Text] A center for treating children infected with AIDS 
opened in the hospital in the village of Ust-Izhora near St. 
Petersburg. 
  Children have gathered there together with their parents 
from 
Russia's various regions, primarily from the Russian 
hinterlands. The reputation of the Ust-Izhora oblast hospital is 
already quite high, and not only in medical circles. Sufficient 
experience and professional skills of center employees are 
magnified here by their rare good will and responsiveness to 
each patient. The high level of laboratory diagnostics, modern 
treatment procedures augmented by total anonymity of 
treatment--all this is very important for the parents who are 
trying to protect their children from today's and tomorrow's 
psychological traumas. 
  The work of this unique children's center became possible 
due 
to the assistance of labor leaders from the Norwegian city of 
Tronheim.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Bespalov, Rostov oblast] </F>
  [Text] A panic has gripped the Rostovites recently due to 
the rumors of an impending infection. 
  Through local press, the Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight 
authorities are constantly expanding the ``assortment'' of the 
infection threatening the health and life of the citizens of 
Don. Izvestiya have already reported an outbreak of 
Crimean hemorrhagic fever. Reports are being received from 
Neklinovskiy, Myasnikovskiy, and Matveyevo-Kurganskiy rayons 
about large-scale infection of tularemia--a very serious disease 
transmitted by rodents and mosquitoes. 
  More than 150 patients have already been recorded. In the 
last several days, 11 children in Rostov have been infected with 
salmonellosis. And finally, the last alarm signal was sounded 
about diphtheria. Last year, this disease afflicted 93 persons 
in Rostov oblast, three of whom have already died. This summer, 
the incidence of diphtheria in Rostov's Voroshilovskiy borough 
alone increased by sixfold. 
  ``Why did this new misfortune befall us?'' say poor 
Rostovites shaking their heads. Some especially nervous citizens 
are already hinting about ``splitting'' to some safe location 
for a month or two. 
  Most likely, this infection phobia is being hyped by the 
reports which for the past two weeks have continued to appear on 
the pages of Rostov newspapers. What is interesting is that 
nothing like that happened before--during censorship, the press 
was strictly warned ``not to hype horrors.'' And I have been 
told that today, frequent information about danger is only one 
of the elements of public concerns about health and vigilance 
which cannot hurt in today's situation. 
  Thus, there is no reason for panic--the best thing would be 
to get immunized. Yet in expert estimates, if there is a threat 
of a tularemia and diphtheria epidemic, more than 80% of 
the 
oblast residents must undergo this procedure. The local 
authorities developed a mass population immunization program, 
and resources were allocated to the public health administration 
for purchasing the necessary immunization preparations. And a 
simple precaution could not hurt.

  [Text] A patient, Shabunov, without fixed place of abode 
was brought to the resuscitation ward of Moscow's Third Clinical 
Hospital in August. He was unconscious and virtually without 
blood pressure. An examination revealed that he had El Tor 
cholera. 
  Today, the patient is doing better. Out of the 20 people who 
came in contact with him, only one nursing aide was infected. 
One more person, a driver who is the subject of many rumors, is 
healthy. 
  Altogether, there are 17 people infected with vibrio 
comma carriers in Russia: in Dagestan, Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Krasnodar, and Naberezhnyye Chelny. Among these, Dagestan and 
Moscow have their ``own'' local infection. And the remaining 
cases are related to infection being brought from India, 
Pakistan, and Turkey. 
  One patient in Kaspiysk died because he sought medical help 
too late. Vibrio comma was identified in a 
four-month-old infant with the family name of Babatov--he is in 
a republican hospital in Makhachkala. 
  Cholera is not a lethal illness if one seeks physician's 
help 
after first symptoms of intestinal disorder. Until the situation 
normalizes fully (and August is the most dangerous month for 
cholera), the physicians recommend that you do not drink 
untreated water, especially from open reservoirs. The cholera 
pathogen has been identified in open reservoir water even during 
relatively safe years 1991-1992. Unwashed vegetable and fruit 
are especially dangerous, and one should be mindful of personal 
hygiene rules. 
  The State Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight took urgent 
measures to ensure that all plague-fighting institutions are 
brought into the state of readiness with respect to cholera. 
Physicians do not expect that the disease will spread widely in 
Russia. Foreign press agency reports about numerous cholera and 
malaria patients in Russia (especially the latter--it is not 
found) are erroneous. 
  Today, there are more than 100 patients in Tajikistan, and 
several dozen people have died. A team of experts was dispatched 
there. 
  There is yet another danger this summer--mushroom poisoning. 
The causes of poisonings in Voronezh, Lipetsk, Tambov, and other 
oblasts have been identified with absolute certainty. All fatal 
outcomes are due to the fact that pale toadstools made their way 
into food. This was determined with the help of the best 
reagents and equipment, and there are no other causes. Starting 
with July, 52 persons were poisoned in Voronezh oblast, and one 
died. In Tambov oblast, it is 46 and 8, and in Lipetsk oblast, 
23 and 4, respectively. In the mushroom samples studied from 
these areas, pesticides and heavy metal salts were detected yet 
these concentrations cannot cause acute poisoning. 
  Another factor is noteworthy: even a small piece of pale 
toadstool in a common frying pan may result in poisoning several 
people. Small children often put these mushrooms into a common 
basket. The physicians have attempted to check the basket 
contents of the mushroom hunters emerging from the forest. And 
what did they find? A pale toadstool was found in one out of 
eight baskets. 
  Recent studies here and abroad revealed that it is dangerous 
to consume Paxillus involutus. It may lead to severe 
allergies.

  [Text] The case of cholera illness discovered in Moscow 
seriously concerned the staff of the city sanitary service, said 
Chief Sanitary Physician of Moscow Nikolay Filatov in a 
conversation with a Russian information agency correspondent. 
Some of them are switched to round-the-clock operation. All 
alimentary products which may carry cholera pathogens, and this 
extends to both food produced in Moscow and that brought from 
other regions, will be subjected to rigorous inspection in order 
to identify the cholera bacillus [sic]. Nikolay Filatov 
elaborated that ``these measures do not, nevertheless, mean a 
ban on food imports into the capital.'' 
  In his opinion, the source of cholera infection is most 
likely located in Moscow and calls upon everyone to observe the 
rules of personal hygiene more carefully and not to consume 
unwashed foodstuffs.

This was reported to a Trud correspondent by the 
chairman of the Department of Especially Dangerous Infections at 
the City Committee on Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, 
Lyudmila Alekseyeva. 
  The patient is in the city's second infectious hospital. He 
is Yevgeniy Zhigunov, 48, without fixed place of abode. 
  Before being brought to the hospital, Zhigunov, in his own 
words, ``had not been feeling well'' for about a week. He was 
working as a guard of a truck in which he also slept. He drank 
water from ponds and puddles where, evidently, he contracted the 
infection. 
  ``This is not an epidemic'' added L. Alekseyeva. 
``Individual 
cases like this occur annually but do not lead to any noticeable 
consequences.''

  [Text] Compared to 1992, the incidence of syphilis in Omsk 
during the first six months of 1993 increased by 2.3 times while 
compared to 1990--by 15.6 times. Moreover, while in 1992 
syphilis was not recorded at all among adolescents and young 
students, six such cases have been recorded to date. The 
unemployed citizens have the highest incidence of 
syphilis--55%--followed by the workers in garment 
manufacturing, textile, and food processing industries with 
12.%, and persons with previous convictions are in third 
place 
with 9.9%. The number of people who contracted gonorrhea 
in 
Omsk has increased by 27% compared to 1992.

  [Text] Russia's epidemiologists are sounding alarm: the 
situation in the country with various types of infections is 
very tense. Now the physicians still have the situation under 
control, but cholera ``import'' from the Asian countries has 
been recorded; it was brought as one of the items acquired by 
shopping trip participants. We even have our ``own'' cholera. In 
Kaspiysk, Dagestan, a patient could not be saved. A 
three-month-old infant with the diagnosis is being treated today 
in a local hospital in Makhachkala. A bum, also with cholera, 
was brought in the infectious disease hospital on Sokolinaya 
gora on in Moscow. Typhoid fever was recorded in Rostov oblast 
and anthrax--in the Altay.

correspondent under the ``Foci of Epidemics Arise on the Don's 
Soil'' rubric: ``Winged Cholera''] 
  [Text] Rostov-na-Donu -- 
The pediatric infectious disease department of Rostov's central 
hospital is today so full that patients are being turned away. 
Typhoid fever, dysentery, salmonellosis, 
diphtheria...Tear-stained mothers, sad and somehow unchildlike 
eyes of little children on transparent emaciated little faces. 
``Survive, survive,'' I want to whisper to each one, ``let the 
fate of that little boy pass you by.'' 
  A month ago, a family infected with diptheria was brought 
here from the Veselovskiy rayon. The 10-year-old little boy 
could not be saved. And this is not the oblast's only case of a 
lethal outcome of diptheria, a disease that was considered 
conquered forever many years ago. And that's really how it was 
in our country. And suddenly -- a sharp jump in morbidity this 
year. According to physician's forecasts, they will not be able 
to stop it any time soon. It is not a matter of 1 year. And only 
God knows how many more children's and even adults' lives this 
contagious disease will take. 
  It seems that nothing foretold the problem in Volgodonsk 
either. But just as suddenly, 130 persons -- big and small -- 
ended up on hospital cots with a diagnosis of typhoid fever. 
  Suddenly a landslide of morbidity due to dysentery, 
salmonellosis, and tularemia began. In the mining city of 
Gukovo, for example, salmonellosis raged twice this summer. Once 
the source was the worker's dining room. The other time the 
kindergarten was the source. About 100 persons became ill with 
dysentery at the same time in Aksay. Cholera flew into the 
oblast from India on the wings of a charter commercial run along 
with Indian beads and leather handbags... 
  And all this happened suddenly? Of course not. Physicians 
specializing in communicable diseases say with certainty that 
diptheria was provoked and predetermined 3-4 years ago. The 
current situation givens them the right to make the fully 
substantiated announcement that it is a result not of chance but 
rather the campaign developed in the mass media against 
vaccinations -- the sole means of guaranteeing immunity against 
diptheria. It may have been public opinion and intentional or 
not, but it was completely purposely designed to be negative 
toward vaccinations. People overloaded with scientific degrees 
but not physicians spoke in the press and on radio and stated 
that vaccinations, especially antidiptheria vaccinations, are 
toxicogenic. 
  ``So why did you keep silent? Why did you not conduct 
counter-propaganda?'' I asked Oleg Dumbadze, physician 
specializing in communicable diseases from the oblast public 
health department. 
  ``And why do we always remain silent about everything?'' he 
responded to my question with a question. ``Because we thought: 
They won't find any simpletons who will believe the madness that 
is being carried over the radio.'' 
  Of course, the problem lies not only in the vaccinations, 
even though they are without a doubt very important. And to now 
make them the entire cause is too simple. The plant 
manufacturing the vaccines remained in Russia, but also 
diptheria roams the territories adjacent to it -- Ukraine and 
Byelarus. From there, infected people travel to us. But it is 
very difficult to receive the vaccine because of the break in 
economic ties. Another plant remained in Tbilisi. 
  The whole problem is in the total shambles of the socialist 
health care system -- a system that other civilized countries, 
as they are now called, have never known. L.S. Sadovskaya, head 
of the No. 2 infectious disease department of the Rostov City 
Hospital, told me painfully that even last summer health care 
organizers from Scotland were in the city. They came to us with 
experience. Indeed, not one country has yet created a system of 
monitoring health that is as interconnected, efficient, and 
maximally inclusive of the population as that recently created 
in our city. And the Western specialists hurried to wreck it so 
as to have time to see that it has already ceased to exist. 
  The break of the sanitary-epidemiological oversight from the 
overall health care system did not play the definitive role in 
the wave of infections. Today, public health physicians are 
essentially removed from responsibility for the operation of 
those enterprises on which people's health depends. Poisoning in 
the workers' dining room? The mine's director is responsible for 
it. Typhoid fever in Volgodonsk? A statement from the Vodokanal 
that infection penetrating the water supply system through 
rusted pipes is responsible. 
  Of course, the officials in charge of the government's 
economic functions are responsible for this. But in our day, 
they find hundreds of reasons to explain similar disruptions. 
  In fact, the oblast administration does not bear 
responsibility for the situation either. For example, public 
health physicians informed V.F. Chuba, head of the 
administration, about the increase in morbidity due to 
infectious skin diseases and spread of pediculosis. According to 
current laws, V.F. Chub has the right to send recommendations to 
places with a request to fix and improve things, which he has 
done. 
  But nothing more. 
  It is crystal-clear that these noble desires will not be 
fulfilled; they will vanish in the economic reforms as into a 
concrete graveyard wall. That's what has already happened with 
the recommendations to the heads of the rayon and municipal 
administrations that the extermination of rodents and 
blood-sucking insects be set up. The former ispolkomy [executive 
committees] did not make the recommendations but instead 
mandated that enterprises allocate money for the work each year 
at all costs. Now that each has obtained economic independence, 
no resources are found for these ``trifles.'' As a result, 
tularemia spread by these very rodents and insects has put 
dozens of people on hospital cots. 
  I have read many inquiries, letters, and recommendations 
these days and have spoken with many specialists both at the 
department of public health and at the oblast center of the 
sanitary-epidemiological oversight. Everyone is doing something. 
They are all busy. And at the same time they are on guard and 
ready at a moment's notice to divert the reproach from 
themselves, citing the work they have done or an article in the 
law or else explaining the situation in terms of the general 
economic collapse. And it turns out that there are no guilty 
parties. 
  But then for whose blame are the children on the hospital 
cots atoning with their suffering?

Conducts Investigation'' rubric: ``Cholera 'Canard' on Toxic 
Pillow''] 
  [Text] Kaluga-Tula -- At the end of last week, radio and 
television excited Russians with a report that a vibrio similar 
to cholera vibrio had been found in the quiet and glorious river 
Protva in the territory of the Zhukovskiy rayon of the Kaluga 
Oblast (almost in the Moscow suburbs). The Protva is a tributary 
of the Oka, and there and to its mother the Volga it extends its 
hand... 
  To put it briefly, an overstrained people was panicked. I 
phone Vasiliy Churin, head of the rayon administration of the 
motherland of Marshall G.K. Zhukov. I ask him to confirm or 
deny the information. 
  ``Yes, we just learned of this ``news'' ourselves from the 
Radio Rossii reports and from the television program Utro 
[morning],'' stated the rayon director. ``Everything is calm 
here.'' 
  I dial the number of the oblast center of the Russian 
Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological 
Oversight. S. Pavlov, the deputy chief physician on 
epidemiological matters, believed that what was found in the 
water was not cholera but what is called NAG-vibrio 
[nonpathogenic paracholera vibrios unrelated to the cholera 
vibrio O antigenic group]. I was advised to turn to A. 
Ovsyannikov, acting head of the center's department of dangerous 
infections, for more complete and exact information. 
  Aleksandr Petrovich confirmed that a vibrio unrelated to 
cholera was floating in the Protva. It was not discovered 
accidentally. Local associates of the epidemiological oversight 
took samples to test for cholera in all rayons from May through 
September at fixed points on open reservoirs (water discharge 
and swimming sites). But the final analysis is done in the 
Kaluga laboratory. A. Ovsyannikov did not know from where the 
information was leaked. 
  The takeoff of the cholera ``canard'' over the Protva echoes 
the extraordinary incident that happened in Tula's Proletarskiy 
rayon. There late at night duty nurses of the First Aid station 
were alarmed by a sharp unfamiliar smell. The called the 
militia. Upon arriving at the site, the duty person sounded the 
alarm for the service patrol post service battalion. The militia 
cut their way through an area with a radius of 350 meters and 
closed the road. They then summoned workers from the municipal 
gas service, Vodokanal, sanitary-epidemiological station center, 
and gas rescue workers. 
  They tested the gas for its phosgene, yperite, and 
hydrocyanic acid content and for the presence of other toxic 
chemicals. But it turned out to be ``of an unknown nature.'' And 
it came from two feather pillows thrown in a trash container in 
the yard of an apartment house. 
  It became clear that specialists from various laboratories 
have rather narrow capabilities for conducting quick analyses. 
But they were not capable of establishing the presence in the 
atmosphere of the gas used in everyday life to destroy those 
very cockroaches, German cockroaches, and Colorado potato 
beetles. 
  Several persons were hospitalized for poisoning as a result 
of the ``gas attack.'' After a day or two, all they were able to 
determine was a ``charge'' of two saboteur-pillows. They were 
impregnated with trichloromethaphos vapors. Evidently, 
inexperienced exterminators of cockroaches or fleas stopped up 
their toilet bowl with them because that was where they were 
forced to dump so highly concentrated a toxic chemical. They 
rinsed it with water, they stopped it up with the down feathers, 
and the poison went to play tricks in the sewer system. And then 
they threw the pillows in the trash. As you see, our emergency 
rescue and other services keep a vigil day and night ready to 
sound an alarm or false call. And really! The unresolved secrets 
on their conscience -- as in the Bermuda Triangle...And all 
because of a frankly weak laboratory base. 
  Moreover, those directly responsible for the night alarm in 
Tula were never found.

<F P=106> [Article by Anastasiya Naryshkina under the ``Extra!'' </F>
rubric: ``Face to Face With Cholera and Plague''; first three 
paragraphs are boxed boldface SEGODNYA introduction] 
  [Text] As of 14 August, there were two persons with a 
diagnosis of cholera in Moscow hospitals. This was reported to 
Interfax in Moscow's main medical administration. One of the 
patients is a vagrant who is in satisfactory condition at the 
moment. The second patient is a female medical worker infected 
by him. Physicians assess her condition as ``average severity 
without signs of worsening.'' 
  In addition to these two patients, ambulance teams and 
internal affairs authorities have sent 10 persons who had been 
in contact with the patients to Moscow infectious disease 
hospitals. 
  As administration workers confirm, the threat of a 
cholera epidemic for Moscow is no rarity. Each year, patients 
infected in other countries are present in the city. In all 
cases, medical personal have succeeded in localizing the focus 
and avoiding any consequences for the city. 
<H5>  The ``Osoboopasniki'' </H5>
  ``Cholera,'' said Tamara Ivanovna with enthusiasm, ``is so 
beautiful!'' and stepped away from the microscope. Tamara 
Ivanovna heads the laboratory of highly dangerous infections in 
the Moscow City Center of the Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight 
[Note: ``highly dangerous'' is the English equivalent of 
osoboopasnyy, which is the word from which 
osoboopasniki (persons working with highly dangerous 
diseases) is derived]. Working under her are several women who 
are not very young. Their sphere of activity is plague, cholera, 
tularemia, anthrax, and other scourges of mankind. The scourges, 
it is true, sit quietly in Petri dishes (more is smeared on 
saucers) fixed to the bottom by something yellow. After handling 
the dishes, you rub your hands carefully with pure alcohol, 
however. In critical cases, when it is necessary to process 
entire sacks of infected rodents, the women dress in complete 
antiplague suits: rubber overshoes, long gowns with ties instead 
of buttons, gloves, masks, and goggles. 
  In the laboratory there is silence (most of the people are 
not on leave) and remarkable cleanliness. The latter is due to 
the efforts of the sole elderly female medical orderly. There 
should be six on staff, but there are is only half the 
physicians and laboratory workers needed (3 and 3 instead of 6 
and 6). And all of them clean their own offices and valuable 
laboratory. 
  At one time, the laboratory was a privileged place. 
Associates received a 20 percent raise their second year of work 
here, a 30 percent raise their third year, and a 40 percent 
raise in subsequent years. For this reason, it was mostly women 
who had to keep their relatives who became ``osoboopasniki.'' 
And it is just such women who work here now, even though the 
privileges have long since become only a memory: They only 
received their salaries for May and June (20,000-30,000 rubles 
each) in July. 
<H5>  A Strike as a Means of Easing the Soul </H5>
  I saw Tamara Ivanovna for the first time in the reception 
room of Moscow's chief public health physician. 
  ``This is the third time I have come,'' she complained to 
the 
secretary. ``I wait and wait and I leave. One hundred thousand 
indeed, it's a joke!'' 
  It is being demanded that T.I. pay 100,000 for a minor 
repair 
in the laboratory. For both her and the chief physician, this is 
big money that they simply do not have. And how! Only 8 of the 
55 million rubles needed for major repair of the Moscow 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Station has been allocated, and of the 
37 million rubles needed for equipment, they only gave 1.4. 
T.I., feeling sorry for the chief physician like a woman, 
dragged out the moment of signing the paper with an enormous 
figure -- 100,000. Since April, the Moscow City 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Station has not paid for its 
electricity -- there is no money. From time to time, the Moscow 
Regional Power Administration phones the chief physician and 
threatens to cut off the electricity. ``You might get 
cracking!'' answers chief physician Filatov. For now, the Moscow 
Regional Power Administration is putting itself in his position, 
but who knows what will happen from one month to the next. ``And 
indeed I cannot stop. I cannot tell the mother of a child who 
became ill in the Pioneer camp that I have no gasoline to go to 
him.'' 
  Because of a lack of money, 10 district 
sanitary-epidemiological stations and the Moscow city center 
nearly went on strike. In any event, they convened a strike 
committee, organized a meeting, and invited a person from the 
``higher-ranking body'', i.e., the Russian Federation State 
Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, to it. The 
guest heard in silence that the sanitary-epidemiological station 
laboratory assistant in the Southern district earns 8,000 a 
month, that each day he can only buy a loaf of bread and carton 
of milk, that that costs 6,000, and that for his 8,000 the 
laboratory assistant performs up to 500 diptheria analyses daily. 
  They say there was a deathly silence in the room and a 
resounding shout on the platform. 
  Almost no one seriously intended to strike, however. Chief 
physician Filatov told me this even before the strike committee 
meeting. Moreover, one of the district sanitary-epidemiological 
stations that stopped operating was threatened with general 
discharge. The most interesting thing is that the threat worked 
-- evidently, the one who wanted to leave had already left. 
  In 2 years, the sanitary-epidemiological station system has 
shriveled by half: Only 42 percent of its schedule-stipulated 
staff now work in it. The epidemiologists have found jobs at 
rayon polyclinics, where they earn twice as much. 
  Would it be difficult to create the sanitary-epidemiological 
station system anew? Filatov, an epidemiologist by education, 
thinks, ``I only felt like a specialist 5 years after beginning 
to work. That is, beyond all the papers and figures, I see the 
cause of this epidemiologic situation or that.'' 
<H5>  Laboratory Life </H5>
  Tamara Ivanovna did not speak at the meeting. I spoke with 
her several days later. ``Across from us are a produce center 
and a rubbish heap located so that, from our window, I can see 
when and what they throw out...At first, I let it pass, but then 
I watched. It was as if something appeared on the table near my 
associates. They cut up a rotten cucumber and ate it, and they 
brought it to their children, if only for some vitamins. And I 
closed my eyes...And they invited me, ``Take some Tamara 
Ivanovna.'' I could not take it from them''. 
  ``We must earn money somehow. One instance of this is 
enough,'' I said carefully, ``we must introduce paid services.'' 
  ``Yes, in many sanitary-epidemiological station laboratories 
(let us say in those where they perform AIDS tests) it is 
possible to perform contract jobs and receive a total of 
100,000-200,000 each.'' 
  ``But we are the osoboopasniki. How can I take money from 
someone because he is suspected of having tularemia? The Moscow 
hospitals that have reached agreements with the Moscow Municipal 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Station pay 700 rubles per analysis, of 
which the laboratory receives 25 percent. But in the past few 
years, despite this ``very ridiculous price,'' the hospitals 
have been trying to get by without this ``luxury'' and have cut 
the number of patients screened to a tenth.'' 
  ``In one quarter the laboratory earned 10,000 rubles for 
such 
analyses.'' 
  ``And finally,'' says T.I., ``I let all this money go on 
``charity'' dinners. The little girls buy bread and preserves. 
We have a kitchen here...'' 
  The ``little girls'' are actually not very fortunate women 
who have sick husbands or parents and who sweep for themselves 
and others. One of them, a mother of two small children, asks 
T.I. for leave and collects and sells bottles. T.I. permits it 
even though she generally does not forgive even a minute's 
tardiness or early departure: ``We must not slack off, we are 
osoboopasniki.'' But she hardly needs to tell her small group of 
people. Judge for yourself. 
  A man who just flew into Moscow yesterday turned up at the 
hospital with a suspicion of cholera. If the ``osoboopasniki'' 
give a positive answer, the operations section of the 
sanitary-epidemiological station (also, moreover, women who are 
not even between 30 and 40 years of age but increasingly of 
retirement age) will seek out all persons who came into contact 
with the patient in Moscow and all those who flew in the same 
aircraft with it, no matter where in the former Union they may 
be. A round-the-clock watch will be established, and infinite 
analyses will begin. 
  ``They simply forget that they have families and children -- 
indeed, this is cholera! In the morning, after a sleepless 
night, after having seen that the others can't manage, these 
women voluntarily remain for a second day. And sometimes I ask 
everything of them. They are simple irreplaceable people.'' 
  They are truly downright irreplaceable. In any case, no one 
is dying to be an ``osoboopasnik.'' I well understand those who 
after having called in response to one of the advertisements 
Tamara Ivanovna has taped up (``Urgent Need for Physicians, 
Laboratory Assistants, Medical Orderlies''), quickly excuse 
themselves and hang up after hearing that they must deal with 
those things that are most repulsive to women -- strange 
diseases, mice, and the smallest of salaries. ``To not smell the 
smell of decaying mice, burn the cotton wadding, but vomit 
anyway. Imagine, there stand dozens of deliveries with hidden 
rodents, and in every little carcass the heart, liver, lymph 
nodes, and bone marrow must be found. One must be a very healthy 
person to perform such work.'' T.I. also began as a laboratory 
assistant. 
  ``I have always said: When my nerves are at their breaking 
point, I will return to the laboratory. I would very much like 
to leave management and work there with the rank and file. But 
there is no one left besides me. As soon as I earned my pension, 
I went to Shestopalov (the former chief physician) with my 
notice, and he said to me, ``You what?! We are rebuilding the 
laboratory...'' 
  ``And now it has been rebuilt -- and it is a pity to quit: 
this laboratory is beautiful. And the office! My former office 
was not a separate office. They were all in one room...But there 
is a great deal of work, and it is always like being on a powder 
keg. And it is very difficult to hold a collective in hand.'' 
  ``How are you able to do it?'' 
  ``Truly, the conscientiousness of my workers helps. And 
then, 
my strength is some sort of authority. I can win. I tell them: 
``We are comrades not self-seekers, not businessmen but medical 
workers.''

``Cholera Flew Into Krasnodar on an Aircraft From Turkey''; 
first paragraph is boldface IZVESTIYA introduction] 
  [Text] Krasnodar -- The ``cholera story'' that 
occurred in Kuban unfolded almost according to the laws of the 
detective genre. True, everything luckily turned out without the 
tragic finale. 
  From on board the aircraft flying to Krasnodar from Turkey 
came the message: One of our passengers needs emergency medical 
assistance. Physicians met the aircraft on the airfield. The 
patient had already lost consciousness, and his pressure was 
nearly at zero... 
  The 53-year-old patient was sent to the infectious disease 
hospital; however, that left another 27 members of the tourist 
group and, in addition, 6 passengers from Krasnodar and 6 
Turkish citizens who had arrived on the same flight. The Turks 
refused examinations and left the airport on their own business. 
The six Krasnodar residents simply hid after passing through 
customs. By nightfall, they were collected from their homes by 
``ambulance.'' And the entire tourist group from Naberezhnyye 
Chelny were, despite their protests, detained and placed in the 
hospital. 
  ``The next day nearly all of them were sent home to 
Naberezhnyye Chelny via a special flight,'' said M. Mkrtchan, 
deputy chief physician of the sanitary-epidemiological 
oversight's kray center. ``But here everything did not end 
without incident: For some reason, the group ``slipped in'' two 
persons with symptoms similar to those of cholera, leaving two 
healthy persons here. Laboratory studies confirmed the diagnosis 
in the two tourists who still remain in our hospital. Later, 
studies of specimens collected by us showed that another five of 
the group members who had flown off also carried cholera's 
causative agent. Of course, we informed our colleagues in 
Naberezhnyye Chelny of this fact.'' 
  ``As it turned out, the group going from Naberezhnyye Chelny 
to Turkey was in Syria. Barely landing in Krasnodar alive, one 
man had already felt bad for several days. He hid his condition, 
however, and tried to treat himself. At the 
sanitary-epidemiological station's kray center, they told me 
that his illness was noticed in the group, but they decided not 
to see a physician. The illness was evidently some sort of 
complication. Indeed, it was a commercial flight, and the group 
had carried many things in from abroad.'' 
  The patients' condition is now improving. No other cases of 
cholera in Kuban have been noted.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Virus Similar to Cholera Causative </F>
Agent Discovered in River Near Moscow''] 
  [Text] Bacteria similar to cholera causative agent have 
been found about one and a half kilometers from Moscow in the 
Protva River. The possibility that, in a few days, the bacteria 
may ``swim'' downstream to the area near Moscow has not been 
ruled out. 
  Laboratory studies of water samples are now being conducted. 
The analysis results will be known today. For now, medical 
personnel are puzzling over the riddle of how the bacteria got 
into the Protva. If it came from the ``closed'' institutes that 
were long involved in developing biological and chemical 
weaponry on the river's shore, it is entirely possible that the 
study bacteria are causative agents of a disease even more 
frightening than mortally dangerous cholera.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Gogol: ``Cholera Autumn''] </F>
  [Text] The famous slogan ``Either the louse will vanquish 
the revolution or else the revolution will vanquish the louse'' 
is becoming increasingly topical. The insect is a symbol in a 
certain sense: It was not its tiresomeness that threatened the 
bolshevik revolution -- louse-borne typhus mowed down people on 
both sides of the barricades. 
  Typhus is not yet among us. Just as before, however, 
infections are approaching and compelling us to understand that 
regardless of whether you are red or white, you may end up in a 
convulsive fever and set your hopes on the Lord God and your 
physician, if he is at your side and if he has the necessary 
drugs. 
  Today cholera is causing serious alarm. An outbreak in 
Central Asia resulting in active antiepidemic actions on the 
part of local physicians has worried Russia. But what if it 
suddenly starts off here? Indeed it will start. The extremely 
rapid spread of the infection is being discussed. As I was 
informed in the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, there are currently 15 
cholera patients and eight carriers of the infection in Russia. 
The disease was mainly carried in from abroad: Nine persons were 
infected with cholera in Pakistan, and seven tourists 
``acquired'' it in Turkey together with leather consumer goods. 
It is hardly worth grieving over the ``iron curtain'' in this 
regard, but a system to protect the population from imported 
infections in view of snowballing black-market tourism must be 
devised in good time. In any case, the draft law developed by 
the sanitary-epidemiological committee regarding protecting 
Russia's territory that regulates sanitary inspection at the 
border should be considered without delay. 
  Yuriy Fedorov, chief specialist of the Russian Federation 
State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, believes 
that the newspaper panic regarding cholera is unjustified: There 
is not even any basis for announcing the quarantine that usually 
follows the infection of 50-60 persons. The country has a 
sufficiently strong public health service despite the break in 
ties between epidemiologists of the new independent states. The 
preparedness of special antiepidemic teams has been increased. 
The country's leadership is well informed of the epidemiological 
situation that has developed. The situation is under control... 
  I remember how during the years of perestroyka, the renowned 
specialist A.I. Kondrusev, chief public health physician of the 
USSR, said, ``Politics does not worry me. It is all 
sovereignization, etc. You come together, you break apart. But 
do not break the single sanitary-epidemiological service. Let's 
not look for trouble.'' It was as he was looking in water. 
Infections are approaching on all fronts: cholera, diptheria, 
measles, hepatitis. Morbidity due to tuberculosis is 
threatening... 
  No matter how much we now talk about integration and 
strengthening intergovernmental economic ties, let us not put 
off until tomorrow the restoration of our 
sanitary-epidemiological system. Infection, if you will forgive 
the banality, does not recognize borders, and it is easier to 
surmount together. Some coordination center that would react 
instantaneously to danger no matter where it approaches from and 
that would direct integrated teams to ``extinguish'' epidemics 
without delay at any point in the CIS is likely necessary. Today 
no one is even obtaining elementary information about the 
dynamics of an infection's spread within the framework of the 
former USSR. At least call the World Health Organization. And I 
suspect that in Geneva they now know more than our people do. 
  Nevertheless, I do not want to leave the reader in fearful 
anticipation of raging epidemics. There is good news: The 
epidemic season, which usually lasts from May to October, is 
coming to an end. Perhaps it will pass.

  [Text] Cholera virus -- what is called cholera vibrio 
-- has been discovered in the Razdolnaya River (Primorskiy 
Kray). 
  The administration and local sanitary-epidemiological 
services are treating this as exceptionally important and are 
seriously worried. The Razdolnaya River, which flows into Amur 
Bay, flows along large population centers through virtually the 
entire Primorye territory. In view of this fact, physicians are 
seriously worried that an epidemic may break out at any moment.

<F P=106> [Article by Vissarion Sisnev:`` ``First Aid'' Delayed: Why </F>
Your Correspondent Needs To Write a`Self-Refutation' ''] 
  [Text] Washington -- Last week my report `` `First Aid' for 
Russia'' was published. In it I stated that a large group of 
American medical personnel would soon be dispatched to 
Novosibirsk to help with their practical experience, drugs, and 
education. One of the initiators of this noble business was 
Doctor Bruce Sanderson from Arkansas, the birth state of 
President Clinton. After learning about him, the President wrote 
a personal letter to the trip organizers, emphasizing that 
direct cooperation between his fellow countrymen and Novosibirsk 
City Hospital No. 25 seemed to him to be a ``splendid project 
that can bring much good.'' The departure was planned for the 
middle of August. 
  Unfortunately, today I must refute my own information. The 
journey has, at best, been delayed for a long time. Doctor 
Sanderson sent a letter to Aleksandr Bychkov, chief physician at 
hospital No. 25, in which he explains what happened in the most 
delicate tones. Assuring his colleague that it was not easy for 
the group members to reach such a decision and that the arrival 
of American ``first aid'' in Siberia is not being canceled but 
only put off into the future, Doctor Sanderson reports that the 
refusal of a number of specialists was dictated by the fact that 
in their opinion, the religious bans approved by Russia's 
Supreme Soviet are unacceptable. 
  It may of course be said that the physicians do not 
necessarily need to react so strongly to the decision of another 
country's parliament and that denying humanitarian aid for this 
reason is not very logical. As is known, however, each monastery 
has its own rule. Not only the physicians, but many others in 
the United States as well, view the Supreme Soviet's recent 
decision regarding limiting the activity of representatives of 
foreign religious organizations as a return to the epoch of 
violating human rights. American legislators, colleagues of our 
deputies, have both in groups and individually approached 
president Yeltsin with the urgent request that he carefully 
weigh everything on the scales of justice before signing the 
draft legislation of 14 July. 
  Included among them are such renowned politicians as 
senators 
Richard Lugar and Jessie Helms and house members Christopher 
Smith, Henry Hyde, and Frank Wolf. In a separate letter, Senator 
Phil Graham argues his negative reaction to the Russian draft 
legislation with the fact that for 200 years already, Americans 
have considered the right to profess one religion or another one 
of the fundamental human rights. And Samuel Eriksson, president 
of the association Lawyers International, noting that his 
organization consults the leaders of 200 million Christians, 
recalls the words of Professor Robert Jackson, chief prosecutor 
at the Nuremburg process, regarding the fact that many 
``inconveniences'' must be put up with in the name of freedom of 
religion, speech, and the press. 
  INFORMATION. The U.S. legislature does not specially 
regulate 
the religious and missionary activity of foreigners within its 
country's territory, but it does provided for specified visa 
control. Since 1 October 1991, the Immigration Service has 
issued a special category R visa to individuals desiring to come 
to the United States for religious activities. It applies to 
clergy professionally executing their activity at KOKFESSII of 
which they have been members for two preceding years (of course 
this also applies to representatives of the Russian Orthodox 
Church), as well as to individuals working professionally for 
religious organizations in the United States and individuals 
working in organizations or tax-exempt affiliates as 
professional clergy. Such a visa is valid for 5 years. 
  The category R visa, like any other, strictly regulates what 
a person receiving it may and may not do. First, each person who 
applies for it must be a member of a religious community 
belonging to a corresponding American noncommercial religious 
organization (there are commercial ones as well). Second, 
holders of a category R visa are not permitted to perform 
nonprofessional work for their religious communities or work for 
other religious communities or any other employers in addition 
to or instead of working for their sponsoring religious 
community. The purpose of these restrictions is to prevent the 
entry of individuals who have no relation to religious activity 
but who simply wish to get into the United States for one reason 
or another.

  [Excerpt] Statistical data are not needed to confirm the 
fact that in recent years more and more people are living on 
free meals: Stockpiles of mushrooms and berries have become an 
unacceptable condition for reliable overwintering. Meanwhile, 
more are gathering them, and more are being poisoned. 
  The Voronezh, Rostov, Lipetsk, and Tambov oblasts are the 
clearest examples. In all cases, poisonings with lethal outcomes 
have resulted from using death-cup amanitas in food. In a random 
survey, they were found in every eighth to tenth basket! One and 
a half grams is enough to end up in the hospital. In 1992, 400 
cases of mushroom poisoning were recorded in Russia. 
Thirty-three persons, including 18 children, died.

Diptheria -- New Disease Unfamiliar to Our Science''] 
  [Text] The mass media has already reported several cases of 
the diseases cholera and malaria in Moscow. Judging by the 
number of telephone calls to our editorial office, the report 
has caused panic among a portion of Muscovites. As Anatoliy 
Solovyev, head of the Main Medical Administration, announced in 
a conversation with SEVOGDNYA correspondent, however, the 
statistics on the diseases cholera (4 cases last year and 2 this 
year) and malaria (33 persons, 24 of them foreigners, have 
contracted it this year) do not give any basis for worry. In A. 
Solovyev's words, physicians are alarmed at the increase in 
adults and children of another highly infectious disease whose 
initial symptoms are so similar to common angina and diptheria. 
  At the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s, more 
than 
20,000 persons died in Moscow each year from diptheria. Under 
these conditions, the only correct solution was made -- mass 
mandatory vaccination of the population. By the mid-1960s, the 
disease's growth curve had fallen sharply, and prior to 1989 the 
cases of diptheria in Moscow numbered in the single digits. 
  It was precisely then that physicians began saying that 
diptheria was finally conquered, and some even expressed doubt 
as to the feasibility of antidiptheria vaccination. Some 
physicians suggested that the mercury-containing preparation 
Merthiolate, which is used as a preservative for preparing the 
vaccine, is detrimental to health even though the World Health 
Organization has officially authorized the use of this 
preparation. 
  On the one hand, an entire generation of physicians has 
grown 
up who have studied diptheria's symptoms based on institute 
textbooks, and on the other hand, most of the population has 
simply refused antidiptheria vaccinations. According to 
specialists' data, about 50 percent of Moscow's permanent 
residents are not currently vaccinated against diptheria. 
  The result has not been slow in coming: according to data 
from Moscow's Main Medical Administration, 774 persons (197 of 
them children) have had a confirmed diagnosis of diptheria in 
1992. During treatment, 17 adults and 6 children died. In the 
first 7 months of this year, 932 cases of the disease have been 
recorded, and 188 of those cases have been among children. 
Ninety-five adults and three children have died. It should be 
noted that not one of those who died had been vaccinated against 
diptheria. Specialists estimated that the per capita vaccination 
of Muscovites for 10 years will cost city authorities 56 billion 
rubles. Its costs about 4,000-500,000 rubles to keep such a 
patient in a clinic for 1 day, and diptheria patients often stay 
in hospitals for 90 and 120 days each. 
  ``Until recently, the serum for treating diptheria was 
supplied by the Stavropolsk Biopreparations Plant,'' says 
Anatoliy Solovyev. ``Since 1 July of this year, supplies have 
been halted and we have been forced to buy drugs from abroad, 
which is of course more (about 30 percent) expensive.'' 
  According to physicians' data, Moscow hospitals now only 
have 
enough serum to last until the end of the year.

Specialists See No Grounds for Special Alarm''] 
  [Text] According to data from the State Committee on Civil 
Defense, Emergency Situations, and Recovery From Natural 
Disasters [GKChS], the number of persons hospitalized for 
typhoid in Volgodonsk in the Rostov Oblast has reached 286. As 
TRUD already wrote several days ago, this dangerous disease 
began spreading because of trouble in the local water supply 
system. As of today, the diagnosis has already been confirmed in 
179 persons. 
  Yesterday an interdepartmental meeting on the problems of 
infectious diseases and the epidemic situation in Russia 
convened under the chairmanship of G. Filatov, deputy chairman 
of the CKChS. Representatives of the RF State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight and Ministry of Health took 
part in the meeting. Increases in the frequency of cases of 
typhoid, cholera, diptheria, and other dangerous infections on 
Russian territory were noted. The following were cited as the 
main reasons: poor-quality untreated water, contaminated 
foodstuffs, and infected tourists traveling into the country. 
  Preventive measures and measures to eliminate those foci of 
disease that have already developed, including in Volgodonsk, 
were discussed. As were were informed at the GKChS press center, 
however, ``the meeting participants expressed their certainty 
that the current situation in Russia regarding infectious 
diseases is not threat.'' Any commentary is, as they say, 
unnecessary.

``Vagrants Remind Us of Themselves With Threat of Mass 
Epidemic''; first paragraph is boldface IZVESTIYA introduction] 
  [Text] Social disorder has carried with it a 
louse-infested train. Dozens of mortally dangerous diseases hide 
in its folds. The first victims are generally overpopulated 
cities. Knowing this, Moscow's public health physicians have 
sounded the alarm. Several days ago under pressure from them, 
the capital's mayoralty allocated an emergency 37 million rubles 
to the city center of the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. Can the risk of mass 
epidemics be bought up for this price? 
<H5>  Little Boy Nicknamed Louse-Ridden </H5>
  I am well acquainted with a family that has been in a state 
of panic for a week now. The papa and mama are from families of 
physicians; flies are not allowed to fly in their home. They 
recently experienced what they perceived as a family scandal if 
not tragedy: The school nurse discovered lice in their 
9-year-old son. The little boy was immediately nicknamed 
Louse-ridden, and suffering from the ridicule of his classmates, 
he flatly refused to attend his classes. 
  His clothing, bed linen, toys -- in a word everything that 
could become a breeding ground for lice -- were ``burned'' in a 
disinfection chamber. But what should be done with the expensive 
soft furniture, the parents agonized. Put it in the disinfection 
chamber? It was too large. The alternative was similar -- burn 
it. 
  ``There is the suspicion that our son picked up the lice 
when 
we were returning by train from our summer vacation,'' said the 
child's father. ``Moreover, the body louse is a carrier of 
typhus. Thank god, everything turned out all right.'' 
  During the summer migration, up to 3 million persons pass 
through Moscow train stations daily. Public health physicians 
acknowledge that from there, dangerous diseases are spread 
throughout the city. 
<H5>  Train Station or Vagrant's Apartment? </H5>
  The Kursk train station is, tentatively speaking, divided 
into about two equal halves: the cashier's room and the waiting 
rooms. Chaos now reigns in the former, where straight rows of 
plastic chairs were recently placed. Bundles of travelers' 
belongings now tower. After laying down newspapers, they sleep 
alongside the newly arrived. Hardly any distance away, under the 
stairwell, one vagrant treats another to cologne. In their own 
way, they are both reminiscent of exhumed corpses. The sharp 
odor of long-unwashed bodies mixed with the aroma of cheap 
perfume makes the air 5 meters around them thick like a wet rag. 
  From time to time, the sweepers chase the people from their 
seats with prods and verbal abuse in order to clean the food 
scraps and various paper trash from the concrete floor. 
  Those who were fortunate enough to buy tickets gain access 
to 
the chairs located in the waiting rooms. Their guard, consisting 
of train station workers, is unyielding in front of the 
``unticketed''; however, the vagrants find gaps nevertheless. I 
noticed several ragamuffin people covered with scabs staggering 
like apparitions between the rows. 
  On the platform, I approached the crew leader of the train 
that just arrived. ``Do passengers complain about the dirt in 
the cars often?'' ``It happens. Everybody rides.''`` But where 
do you disinfect your bed linen? At the train station's bathing 
and delousing centers?'' ``What bathing and delousing centers! I 
don't remember when they were operating at train stations...'' 
  At the Kazan train station, security guards from the firm 
Pravoporyadok [Law and Order] checking tickets at the entrance 
to the train station's buildings are no obstacle for vagrants 
because a hole of impressive size was made long ago in the 
grating separating the cashier's room from the waiting room. 
  Only at the Savelovsk train station were there almost no 
vagrants. 
  At the entrance of the Pavelets train station, however, I 
stumbled upon a whole line of people who had lost their human 
appearance. 
  As later became clear, the train station's administration 
had 
given specialists from the international association Physicians 
Without Borders one of its rooms. The associates of this 
nongovernmental organization had voluntarily taken it upon 
themselves to provide all medical, legal, and psychological aid 
within their power to Moscow's homeless. 
<H5>  What Physicians Without Borders Can Do </H5>
  The experience of Physicians Without Borders may be termed 
unique. Working in accordance with its own program The Homeless 
since November 1992, they have become the only individuals in 
the country with the slightest bit of scientific information 
about those people that fate has cast to the very bottom of life. 
  According to the association's estimates, the number of 
homeless persons in Moscow may exceed 150,000 (according to 
official data, they numbered 30,000 as of January 1992). These 
people who are unable to observe elementary hygiene rules (often 
through no fault of their own) are becoming potential carriers 
of diptheria, cholera, typhus, tuberculosis, and other extremely 
dangerous diseases. Social pariahs despised by everyone, they 
prefer to not seek help at state medical institutions. And the 
services of private physicians are, as is well known, beyond the 
means of even citizens with residence permits. 
  After having worked at the Kursk and Pavelets train stations 
for several months, the association specialists accumulated 
statistical data about the most characteristic ailments for 
vagrants. Half of them suffer from wounds and trophic ulcers, 
and a third (all in all) suffer from tuberculosis and pneumonia. 
One hundred percent are infested with lice! A total of 2,500 
homeless persons were examined. 
  `` `Ambulance' physicians generally refuse to come for 
vagrants because the subsequent disinfection of their ambulance 
takes several hours,'' says Aleksey Golikov, associate of the 
association. ``We therefore take the most seriously ill to 
hospitals in our own two minibuses.'' 
  By agreements reached with six hospitals, Physicians Without 
Borders send those under their care there for treatment. In 
exchange for the inconveniences, they supply medical personnel 
with scarce drugs. 
  After having been treated, the vagrants are returned to the 
train stations -- where else? There they live for years; they 
collect empty bottles, panhandle, and engage in petty theft. 
Some even raise something similar to a family. A family 
consisting of a husband, wife, two children, and the wife's 
mother have already been living at one train station for a long 
time. 
  After having returned home, the homeless quickly acquire 
their previous bouquet of illnesses. To put it briefly, the 
circle is completed. 
  ``Moscow's government acknowledges that the homeless problem 
exists, but its first reaction is to try to drive then from the 
train station,'' believe the association specialists. ``But 
cutting off vagrants' access to the train stations during the 
cold part of the year is sentencing them to certain death.'' 
  Like now, before the onset of the winter cold spells, the 
mayoralty is making fitful attempts to keep the risk of an 
epidemic to a minimum in a manner contrary to humanitarian 
principles. And for this, they have allocated 27 million rubles 
that will be used to repair two delousing stations -- on Red 
Guard Boulevard and Bauman Street. 
<H5>  Purgatory for Outcasts </H5>
  Moscow now has a single delousing station equipped with a 
powerful disinfection chamber. As a rule, vagrants are sent here. 
  The shabby building of the disinfection station is located 
at 
the city's edge. One must travel far to reach it -- first by 
subway and then by overcrowded bus. 
  The disinfection procedure costs money -- about 1,500 
rubles. 
But vagrants sent by Physicians Without Borders have their 
insects removed at the expense of the organization. They are 
sent twice weekly -- on Wednesdays and Thursdays. It must be 
said that only half of those receiving a referral use it -- an 
average of 20 persons each week. Can the bathing and delousing 
center really not handle this influx of patients? 
  ``The point,'' says Grigoriy Ostanin, the center's chief 
physician, ``is that in the event an emergency situation 
develops in Moscow it is impossible to conduct mass disinfection 
of the population. Let us say an outbreak of cholera puts us in 
a hopeless situation because medical standards call for a 
separate bathing and delousing center for this disease.'' 
  Public health physicians have also been deprived of reserves 
such as as municipal baths. Previously, they were equipped with 
disinfection chambers and divided into what were called 
``dirty'' and ``clean'' halves. In recent years, nearly all of 
the capital's baths have been transformed into commercial saunas. 
  Disinfection chambers and railroadmen have been managed 
similarly. Not one is operating at any of Moscow's train 
stations even though in April the municipal commission on 
emergency situations demanded that the Moscow railroad 
administration renovate them. 
  ``For this and other reasons,'' states Ostanin, ``the 
situation regarding Moscow's sanitary condition may become 
critical at any moment in time.'' 
  According to data from the analytical department of the 
Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological 
Oversight, the number of diptheria patients in the capital more 
than doubled during the past year, the number of persons with 
scabies and syphilis doubled, and the number of persons with 
tuberculosis increased by one third. And the most frightening 
thing is that these diseases are more lethal among children than 
among adults. 
  But I nevertheless remain doubtful: Why reconstruct the 
bathing and delousing centers if potential disease carriers 
prefer to bypass them on account of 7 versts? (Several dozen 
vagrants arriving for sanitary treatment weekly is a meager 
number compared with the tens of thousands that stubbornly 
ignore the procedure). Perhaps all this is being done in the 
event of mass epidemics of diptheria, cholera, and typhus? Then 
it would seem that this would be directly acknowledged. And it 
would become clear that the homeless remain the problem of 12 
associates of Physicians Without Borders and the Ministry of 
Railways security guards who drive vagrants from the train 
station. 
  In the meantime, typhus, tuberculosis, and cholera are 
classified as what are termed ``socially significant 
infections,'' and vaccinations against them will not save you. 
And then there are the many others who, as doctors confirm, have 
weakened immunity because of a decrease in their standard of 
living. The unbelievable congestion in public transportation, at 
stores, and at train stations and the poor sanitary condition of 
the streets increase the likelihood of outbreaks of epidemics. 
And in such a situation, vagrants become one of the main risk 
factors. 
  The vagrant problem must obviously become an object of the 
most careful attention. A special integrated government program 
is needed. But as is well known, the government has more 
important concerns.

<F P=106> [Article: ``Diphtheria: There may not be enough vaccine''] </F>
  [Text] In the first 6 months of this year approximately as 
many cases of diphtheria were registered in Russia as in all of 
1992--around 4,000. This ailment has already taken the lives of 
104 persons (131 last year). The most unfavorable situation has 
evolved in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Krasnodar, Moscow and 
Leningrad oblasts, Maritime Kray and Saratov Oblast. This was 
communicated to this ITAR-TASS correspondent by Anatoliy 
Monisov, deputy chairman of the State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. 
  Specialists believe the main cause of such swift growth of 
diphtheria morbidity to be insufficient vaccination of the 
population. Many parents protest against immunizing their 
children, while the adults themselves rarely get reimmunized. 
Nonetheless, vaccine remains the most dependable defense against 
diphtheria. 
  Anatoliy Monisov is also troubled by the fact that Russia's 
supply of the needed preparations is short. You see, the 
enterprises weren't ready to produce such a large quantity of 
vaccine, and the production process takes 4-8 months. Such that 
we can't expect the situation to normalize until next year, the 
specialist feels. Anatoliy Monisov noted that the government has 
developed a special ``antidiphtheria'' program, which has now 
been forwarded to the Supreme Soviet. In order to hasten the 
process of implementing this document the State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight asked the government to begin 
its financing sooner. The cost of the program is 6 billion 
rubles over 3 years (disregarding inflation), and a significant 
share of this money will go to reinforcing the production 
capacities of enterprises making the vaccine. 
  In addition the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological 
Oversight has sent a plan of diphtheria control measures to 
local agencies, which should help medical workers in remote 
regions in their fight against the disease.

Volgograd Death Hasn't Grown Out of Knee-Pants Yet, While in 
Donetsk it is Roaming Unidentified''] 
  [Text] When the last youngster infected in Volgograd Oblast 
dies from AIDS--a sudden and incomprehensible outbreak of 
disease in Southern Russia--all but the unfortunate parents will 
probably forget about this. 
  It has already been half a year since the 3-year statute of 
limitations on the criminal AIDS case. The former director of 
the city health department advanced in his career as far as 
deputy head of the oblast administration, and even mothers, left 
alone with their grief, no longer haunt the thresholds of the 
Volgograd mayor's office and city health department asking for 
help for their children in food, money and medicine, so as to 
make it until the world invents a medicine against the 
frightening ailment. Some of them write letters and describe 
their misfortune only to a certain woman who is not invested 
with power and who lives in Tyumen-- Tatyana Khrustik. In her 
own life she experienced what it means to live and know that 
your child may die at any minute. 
  Now Tatyana Petrovna, who doesn't trust the local 
authorities 
and the oblast health department, goes from one commercial firm 
to another in her search for assistance. Strange as it may seem, 
sponsors are still to be found. The Tyumen Avantash Bank, the 
Trigon firm, an airline company, the Volgograd Transportation 
Administration, and Norwegian trade unions. The director of 
Moscow's Astra Company, Mikhail Semenovich Tsivin, explained his 
assistance--paying for medicine for AIDS patients--with just a 
single phrase: I am a human being, and I want children to live. 
  But in the last half year four youngsters died in 
Volgograd--all boys. And other boys who are older and quite 
healthy are beating on the windows of the AIDS center. 
  Of 42 infected children, 34 remain among the living. And 
this 
is just in Volgograd Oblast. They are hidden from everyone. 
Trying to remain incognito, the parents sometime even refuse 
benefits to which they are entitled. 
  A 5-year-old girl almost succumbed to AIDS while mother 
frantically raced through the rayon in search of a telephone to 
call an ambulance. You couldn't go to your neighbors, after all, 
and you're not going to utter the diagnosis aloud. But many 
families with sick children still don't have telephones. 
Volgograd authorities promised to help, but they haven't 
supported their decision with money. 
  Today most mothers who as a rule have two dependent 
children, 
one sick with AIDS, are living on a disability pension and 
assistance. 
  The only place in Donetsk where there are no lines is the 
anonymous AIDS testing office. And for no good reason, believes 
N. P. Grazhdanov, director of the oblast center fighting the 
frightening disease. From the moment when it became clear that 
immunodeficiency virus knows no boundaries, 36 infected persons 
were revealed in Donetsk Oblast, three of whom have already 
died. Twenty-five out of these 36 turned out to be foreigners, 
and were deported. However, there are no grounds for 
reassurance. In N. P. Grazhdanov's opinion there are around 150 
AIDS virus carriers in Donetsk Oblast, of whom both the 
authorities and doctors are unaware. People at the bottom of the 
ladder are a special headache to medical workers. It doesn't 
appear that they enter into any kind of relations with 
foreigners, they prefer drinking perfume to taking drugs, but 
they still manage to catch the fatal disease somehow. 
  The example offered by the most recently revealed virus 
carriers is traditionally instructive in this aspect: A fitter 
working for a certain enterprise in Makeyevka lived in a 
dormitory and was not distinguished by an especially sober view 
on life; a young lady who had a dozen sex partners was able to 
communicate only their first names, and nothing more.

  [Text] The epidemiological situation in Russia is 
unfavorable--such is the conclusion of the RF State Committee 
for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, which analyzed reports 
from public health services of all of the country's regions over 
the past 9 months. In this connection Yelena Kotova, chief of 
the state committee's epidemiological department communicated 
the following: 
  TYPHOID FEVER. Morbidity increased by 132 percent in 
comparison with the same period of last year. The two largest 
outbreaks were in Dagestan (the Caspian region) and Volgodonsk 
(the South of Russia). Six hundred twenty-one persons suffered. 
The cause-- accidents involving water supply networks. 
  DYSENTERY. Morbidity increased by 20 percent. Twenty-five 
outbreaks were noted, primarily in Astrakhan and Leningrad 
oblasts, Kalmykia, Khanisia, Komi and Northern Ossetia. Two 
thousand four hundred persons suffered. 
  DIPHTHERIA. Morbidity is assuming a serious clinical 
epidemic 
nature. Just since the beginning of the year 5,888 persons have 
suffered this illness in Russia, 129 of whom have died. 
  MEASLES AND WHOOPING COUGH. Morbidity increased by 200 
percent and 29 percent respectively. 
  CHOLERA. Twenty-one patients and eight carriers have been 
registered. Of them, 16 patients and five carriers ``imported'' 
this disease from India and Pakistan.

Wave of Infections Rolls Deep Into Russia''] 
  [Text] Anthrax cases were registered in Iskitim, 
Novosibirsk Oblast, according to Vladimir Akulov, a 
correspondent of the Postfactum Agency and director of the 
oblast center for sanitary- epidemiological oversight. Anthrax 
was transmitted to butchers and cooks of the dining hall of the 
local construction administration No 28. The meat had been 
purchased in Altay, and it was accompanied by a certificate 
issued by the local center for sanitary-epidemiological 
oversight. 
  Four patients are now in the infection hospital. The 
necessary steps were taken to keep this disease from spreading 
through the oblast. 
  A diphtheria epidemic has begun in Vladivostok. In the last 
few days 85 cases of disease were registered. The average age of 
the patients is 25-30 years. 
  An extraordinary epidemiological commission was established 
in the city administration to eliminate the sources of disease. 
  According to a report from the Tomsk newspaper KRASNOYE 
ZNAMYA 29 diphtheria cases were revealed in Tomsk since the 
beginning of the year, two of them fatal. In the meantime only 
five diphtheria cases were registered in the past 20 years. The 
administration head of Tomsk Oblast published a resolution on 
fighting diphtheria. According to the resolution whenever 
applicants are accepted for secondary special educational 
institutions and VUZes, they must present an immunization 
document. All children in schools, boarding schools and 
nurseries are to be immunized this quarter. Testing for 
pathogenic bacteria at industrial enterprises will be one of the 
diphtheria control measures. The chief physician of the 
sanitary-epidemiological station has been granted the right not 
to issue trade permits without presentation of the necessary 
medical documents. The Tomsk city epidemiological station will 
be given 5 million rubles to acquire the necessary medical 
resources. 
  An outbreak of epidemic hepatitis was noted in schools of 
Kamensk (Rostov Oblast). Several students have been 
hospitalized. Several schools and boarding schools were closed 
in order to prevent the spread of hepatitis. Medical workers 
believe that overcrowding in the schools, the poor diet of the 
students and unsatisfactory public health and hygienic 
conditions were the causes of illness. 
  Case of food poisoning have become more frequent in 
Novokuznetsk. Forty-five poisoning cases caused by 
staphylococcus were registered in the city. It was revealed that 
most poisoning cases were associated with consumption of poor 
quality sour cream. 
  Other cases of mass intestinal infections were also 
registered in Kemerovo Oblast in October. One hundred forty-two 
persons suffered typhoid fever, an intestinal infection, because 
of a faulty water intake in the town of Novyy Karakan (Belovskiy 
Rayon). Doctors registered over 120 cases of dysentery in 
Krapivinskiy Rayon (Zelenkova village). 
  Materials on these cases are being forwarded by oblast 
centers for sanitary-epidemiological oversight to the procuracy 
for the purposes of instituting criminal proceedings.

abruptly in 17 of the country's regions. 
  ``An epidemic may break out in other territories as well,'' 
was the pessimistic forecast offered by the Russian Health

  [Text] The number of cholera patients in Russia may 
increase. This time the vibrio was possibly imported from 
Bulgaria. According to the State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight signs of illness usually 
accompanying cholera appeared in a Russian citizen traveling by 
train from Bulgaria. A group of Russian tourists was riding in 
the same car. Specialists have to determine whether the 
intestinal disease the patient has is really cholera. The 
patient and others who were in the car with him are now 
hospitalized in Bryansk for establishment of the final 
diagnosis. And in the meantime the statistics of cholera 
morbidity in Russia remain the same: 15 patients and 8 carriers 
of the cholera vibrio. In this case 11 patients and 5 carriers 
were infected abroad. 
  Around 600 persons who had contact with vibrio carriers were 
recently hospitalized in Kazakhstan for cholera testing. Among 
these subjects, disease has been detected in 16 thus far. 
Epidemiological oversight has been intensified in Alma-Ata, 
especially on main transportation routes, in terminals and at 
airports. For example, imports of vegetables and fruits from the 
republic's southern regions have been banned. Special attention 
is being turned to tourists coming from Asian countries by air. 
Every person arriving in Alma-Ata remains under the observation 
of medical workers for around a day. As a result several persons 
infected with cholera vibrio were once again detected on 16 
September among foreign passengers in an airplane from Karachi. 
  A Russian tourist returning from Turkey never made it to his 
home in Orekhovo-Zuyevo. He was taken off the Sophia-Moscow 
train at the Romanian-Moldovan border and hospitalized. The 
diagnosis-- cholera. The Moldovan epidemiological service 
discovered cholera vibrio in another three of his fellow 
travelers. Moldovan doctors took the necessary precautions, and 
issued warnings of the danger to the epidemiological services of 
Ukrainian and Russian cities through which the Sophia-Moscow 
passes.

``Equal to AIDS, if not More Frightening''] 
  [Text]Today, scientists are already absolutely sure 
of the existence of 7 (seven!) hepatitis viruses infecting man 
and striking his most important organ--the liver. The disease 
arising in this case take many forms: hepatitis, cirrhosis and 
primary cancer of the liver. It seems as if we can no longer 
amaze or frighten our people by anything. But this.... 
  At the infection hospital. The hepatitis and viral disease 
department. Those who wind up here can now recall (with a 
doctor's help) how and where they became infected. ``I was 
working as a dental hygienist,'' said an attractive young woman. 
An elderly woman bitterly recalled undergoing a course of 
acupuncture a few months ago, and then there was another, a 
quite one, in the corner of the ward, who had recently visited 
Israel as a guest. 
  And now let's move on to the pediatric clinic, the 
gastroenterology department. Children with a terrible 
diagnosis-- cirrhosis of the liver--are treated here. And most 
know that this disease is the punishment suffered by alcoholics. 
Sometimes it is hard for the doctor to figure out how this 
disease came about. The mother of an 11-year-old boy, her eyes 
sunken from sleepless nights no longer able to shed tears, 
explained: ``The boy fell ill after a routine immunization. 
Botkin's disease was the diagnosis. He recovered, but he still 
feels poorly sometimes.'' Now the sentence has been handed 
down--a year and a half to live, nothing can be done. The 
doctors are powerless. Now that the disease has come into its 
own. But could anything have been done sooner? Yes. That's what 
this article is about. 
  Viral hepatitis is a disease that occurs extensively 
throughout the entire world. Up to 250,000 cases are registered 
annually in our country. These are only the acute and obvious 
cases of infection, while in fact it is believed that this 
figure is understated by a factor of 10! Perhaps only acute 
respiratory diseases afflict people more often. And as for the 
number of fatalities and complications, there are no equals to 
this infection. Medical workers of the developed countries, in 
which the fight against viral hepatitis has been raised to the 
rank of a state program, came to understand this long ago. 
  Relying on laboratory tests, medical workers can distinguish 
hepatitis today into type A (the dirty hands disease) and type B 
(so-called serum hepatitis). Five other variants are not 
recognized by Russian statistics, and they are classified by a 
process of elimination as a mixed group--neither A nor B. 
  In Russia, hepatitis A is encountered more often than the 
other types, making up 60-70 percent of all hepatitis cases in 
adults and 70-80 percent in children. As with any other 
intestinal infection, hepatitis A is typified by seasonal 
occurrence. And so it is now, in fall, that epidemiologists are 
noting an increase in morbidity, especially among children 
attending nursery school and schoolchildren. Many probably 
recall that gamma-globulin immunizations used to be given 
against jaundice in times of mass outbreaks. Today, this is 
hardly possible--it's expensive, and the preparation is not 
available in sufficient quantity. 
  How do we protect ourselves? The advice is simple--wash your 
hands more frequently, don't eat unwashed food, don't drink 
water from unfamiliar sources, and it would be better to boil 
all drinking water. And if you happen to make contact with a 
person who has the disease, be on guard for 5 weeks. 
  Medical workers advise caution to tourists to developing 
countries of Asia and Africa. This infection is extremely 
widespread there, and most of the population suffers the disease 
in early childhood. Western tourists make an effort to immunize 
themselves against hepatitis A. There is a specific vaccine 
already, and clinical tests have proven it to be highly 
effective. Such a preparation has also been developed in Russia, 
its study has just begun, and therefore we need to follow the 
rule that ``Saving the drowning is a matter for the drowning 
themselves.'' 
  And this is in fact possible. The Scandinavian countries, 
where the hepatitis A is an extremely rare phenomenon, are an 
example of this: Isolated cases for every 100,000 population 
(for comparison, the figure is up to 100 in certain regions of 
our country). At least another two types of hepatitis are 
transmitted by dirty hands. Hepatitis E has now been studied 
sufficiently well. This type occurs most often in developing 
countries. Russians are absolutely defenseless before it, and 
its course is much more serious than that of hepatitis A. 
Vaccines against this infection are not even available yet 
abroad, and therefore the sole defense is to observe the rules 
of personal and social hygiene. 
  And now let's talk about the forms of hepatitis for which 
blood is the gateway. In the early 1960s the American scientists 
Blamberg discovered a characteristic serum protein of hepatitis 
virus, for which he was subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize. 
Since that time a real possibility has appeared for doctors to 
distinguish between only two types of hepatitis by blood 
tests--A and B. 
  Detection of a protein (antigen) specific to hepatitis B in 
blood made it possible to use this marker to determine the 
extent of blood infection. Modern testing methods are so 
sensitive that they can detect a quantity of virus of less than 
1 gm in a billion trials. This quantity of virus, by the way, is 
fully sufficient to cause disease. For this, the virus needs to 
find the slightest break in the skin or mucous membranes of the 
recipient, enter the blood through it, and then reach the liver 
with its flow. The liver is the only place in the human body 
where hepatitis B virus can multiply. Infected persons react 
variously to what happens in the liver. As a result totally 
different courses appear--virus carrier, acute infection, 
chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and cancer of the liver. It is not 
at all necessary for jaundice to accompany acute hepatitis B. 
Medical workers note that the beginning of disease can recall 
the pattern of intestinal infection, and even ear, nose and 
throat diseases, especially among children. The main thing is 
that the liver is enlarged, which is something you have to know 
how to detect. 
  A diagnosis as to precisely what type of hepatitis is 
present 
can be established only after a number of specialized laboratory 
tests. To prevent infection of patients receiving transfusion of 
blood (plasma), its preparations and components, all blood 
procured from donors must be tested mandatorily. Such 
tests have been conducted in our country for 20 years already, 
but for some reason post-transfusion hepatitis continues to be a 
frequent phenomenon. Could it be because the blood service has 
been using tests of very low sensitivity? 
  In developed countries, where a very serious effort has now 
been made for over 10 years to test blood for hepatitis B, its 
proportion in the structure of hepatitis after blood transfusion 
has been reduced to 10 percent. Ninety percent of hepatitis is 
associated there with infection by yet another virus--hepatitis 
C. This virus resisted detection for a long time, and what is 
interesting is that the test for this infection was developed 
before the agent itself was described--in 1989. A check of 
donors in many countries of the world revealed that a 
significant part of the world's population is afflicted with 
hepatitis C. What raises concern is the fact that presence of 
infection can be judged only indirectly for the moment, by 
revealing antibodies to the virus (as for example in the cases 
of AIDS and syphilis), which significantly reduces the true 
number of infected individuals. Today most developed and 
developing countries have introduced mandatory testing of blood 
for hepatitis C into their blood services. This isn't as 
successful of course as in the case of hepatitis B; nonetheless, 
today this is the only means of preventing post- transfusion 
hepatitis C. It may be said that blood is not yet being tested 
for this infection in our country. 
  If hepatitis is so widespread, it is fully logical to 
suppose 
that it is transmitted not only by donated blood, but also by 
other pathways. In fact, hepatitis B is astounding in the 
diversity of the means by which the body is infected. Children 
fated to be born from mothers who are carriers of the infection 
or who contracted the disease during pregnancy (and not 
necessarily in its jaundice form) fall into the risk group. This 
is why hepatitis B testing of pregnant women is mandatory in 
many countries. Hepatitis B is transmitted sexually (the virus 
is detected in sperm and in vaginal secretions). A special risk 
group has been determined-- prostitutes, who are breeding 
grounds of infection. Unfortunately there are few who know that 
hepatitis B is even categorized as a venereal disease for this 
reason. The slightest break in a partner's mucous membranes is 
enough for the virus to get into the blood. These two 
pathways--vertical (from mother to child) and horizontal 
(sexual)--perhaps dominate in various developing countries, in 
which it is believed that over 20 percent of the population is 
infected. It has been noted that entire families may be infected 
with hepatitis B virus. We know of one Moscow family in which a 
newborn infant contracted the disease in the hospital, the 
mother was then infected from the child during breast feeding, 
and finally the father of the child managed to catch the disease 
from the mother. 
  Neither the sexual nor the vertical pathway of infection is 
typical of hepatitis C, but as with hepatitis B, this disease is 
transmitted through close personal communication, when the 
elementary rules of hygiene are not observed. Viruses may be 
transmitted from one to another by sharing combs, manicure and 
pedicure instruments, and tattooing tools. 
  Still, the greatest percentage of infections occurs in 
therapeutic institutions. Medical workers are especially at 
risk. Selective testing of medical personnel revealed particular 
hepatitis B markers five times more frequently that in donated 
blood. Several cases of acute hepatitis are noted every year in 
almost every large clinic, in which case fatalities have been 
known. They have all been the result of job-related infection. 
Medical workers who come in contact with blood daily are at the 
greatest risk--surgeons, surgical and procedural nurses, and 
specialists in procuring and testing the blood of donors and 
patients. Hepatitis B and C infection may spread within a 
hospital if diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that invade 
the skin and mucous membranes are carried out with reusable and 
poorly cleaned instruments. 
  Among patients, those who receive poorly tested blood on the 
basis of vital indications carry the greatest risk of falling 
ill. This is well known to medical workers, but they are 
powerless if material support to the use of high quality blood 
tests is insufficient. Are there really no other ways of 
stopping hepatitis B and C besides blood tests? 
  In 30 years of scientific research in this field, some 
things 
have already been accomplished. Creation of a specific vaccine 
against hepatitis B is the greatest accomplishment. When 
scientists reported this, the press wrote triumphantly that the 
first vaccine against cancer had been developed. Hepatitis B 
vaccinations have been available for over 12 years already, 
during which time hundreds of millions of the planet's 
inhabitants have been immunized. It has been demonstrated that 
the vaccination course can provide defense against the virus for 
7 or more years. 
  Unfortunately you can't get immunized anywhere in Russia 
today, either free of charge or for money. The domestically made 
preparation has not yet been perfected for practical use. 
Foreign preparations are not being purchased, although Western 
firms have already been producing second-generation vaccine that 
is absolutely safe and effective for a long time. Medical 
workers and newborn infants from mothers who are carriers of the 
virus are mandatorily immunized in most developed countries. But 
even where the epidemiological situation is recognized to be 
unfavorable (there are several such regions in Russia), 
hepatitis B vaccine is included on the calendar of children's 
immunizations. Responding to a proposal by the World Health 
Organization, a number of African countries and Italy have begun 
implementing a program of expanded immunization of the 
population. 
  It is disappointing to learn of such accomplishments that 
are 
inaccessible to Russia. This is why Moscow's scientists and 
medical workers have joined together to establish the Hepatitis 
Control Assistance Fund--a public organization bringing together 
all who desire to join in the struggle using the resources of 
modern accomplishments in the epidemiology, prevention, 
diagnosis and treatment of viral diseases of the liver. The gap 
today between what has been accomplished through world progress 
in the area of hepatitis and what Russian practical health has 
available to it today is rather large. The fund has developed 
the ``Anti-hepatitis'' program, and we invite all who wish to do 
so to work with us to carry it out. The fund already has a 
possibility for testing donated blood in the way it is done in 
America and Europe. We also have hepatitis B vaccine. 
  In Moscow we can be reached by telephone at 490-1414 and 
365-8998.

<F P=106> [Article by Kirill Dybskiy: ``Cholera Vibrio has Grown Up in </F>
Moscow''] 
  [Text] An unprecedented outbreak of acute 
infectious diseases, including cholera, was documented this 
summer in Russia. This week a focus of infection was revealed in 
Moscow. A press conference held by the Russian State Committee 
for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight (GKSEN) was devoted to an 
analysis of the alarming situation now developing. 
  As was noted by Aleksandr Monisov, deputy chairman of the 
GKSEN and assistant Russian chief state public health physician, 
the epidemiological situation in Russia can be characterized 
today as alarming. This is associated primarily with interstate 
migration of the population within the CIS and abroad, and with 
expansion of the channels of exchange of freight, goods, food 
products and agricultural raw materials. Outbreaks and spreading 
of dangerous infectious diseases such as plague, yellow fever, 
typhoid fever and especially cholera have been observed in this 
connection. Thus, an unprecedented cholera outbreak was observed 
in 1992--El Tor Ogava vibrio was discovered in 68 countries of 
the world, with the total number of patients being 461,000 
persons (see table). This year 118,000 patients were revealed in 
6 months. The largest proportion of infected individuals is 
found in the countries of the Near and Central East--Pakistan, 
Afghanistan, India, Turkey, Syria. An outbreak of cholera was 
recently noted in a number of regions of Latin America as well.

  As Mr Monisov noted, Russia has not been spared this fate 
either. The last 3 years were extremely strained for Russian 
epidemiologists: Following a mass outbreak of cholera in 1990 in 
Stavropol imported from Syria (49 persons fell ill), the 
situation stabilized, but not for long. This year an outbreak of 
cholera epidemic imported from India and Turkey was noted (a 
total of 17 patients in Makhachkala, Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnodar 
and Naberezhnyye Chelny). However, medical workers are troubled 
even more by the appearance of ``home-grown'' cholera, the 
source of which is found in Russia's own biological environment. 
Thus, this year medical workers noted three cholera foci in this 
country. The first case was documented in May in Kaspiysk 
(Dagestan)--a certain Sergey Makhin drank his fill of untreated 
water from a canal. The result--cholera in its most acute form. 
It was impossible to save the patient. His wife was infected as 
well. A month later cholera vibrio was found in the body of a 
4-month infant in Makhachkala. And then the most alarming 
communication: On 8 August the police picked up Vladimir 
Shabunov, a 40-year-old person without a permanent place of 
residence, at Kursk Station in Moscow. He was in a coma. After 
he underwent resuscitation El Tor Ogava cholera vibrio was 
isolated from him. Twenty persons who had come in contact with 
the patient were revealed. Cholera virus has already been 
detected in the body of one of the orderlies. Yet another person 
who had come into contact with Shabunov--a 26-year-old 
driver--fled the hospital on 12 August, and the police are 
actively searching for him. 
  The agent of cholera infection--El Tor Ogava vibrio--is 
classified as a ``waterborne infection,'' and therefore it lives 
and multiplies in the untreated water of open-air sources. 
According to specialists 50 percent of Russia's population uses 
water that potentially favors cholera infection. 
  Responding to questions from a KOMMERSANT-DAILY 
correspondent, Mr Monisov said that the former USSR republics 
through which infection penetrates to Russian territory 
unhindered present the greatest danger to Russia. Thus, cholera 
is raging now in Tajikistan. Over 100 patients have already been 
documented, of whom 41 have died. Presence of infamous Somali 
refugees in the country is also an unfavorable factor. They are 
a ``risk factor'' not only in relation to cholera but also in 
relation to the entire spectrum of dangerous infections. All of 
this, Mr Monisov emphasized, led to the need for drafting a law 
``On Protection of Russian Federation Territory From Importation 
and Spread of Especially Dangerous Infections'' and a federal 
``Migration'' program regulating migration processes.

  [Excerpt][Passage omitted] And so, in addition to the 
Moscow cholera case there are others. And anyway, where was he 
from, this homeless man of Moscow by the name of Shabunov, an 
older man, 40 years of age according to his passport? When no 
pulse could be determined, pressure dropped and convulsions 
increases, he was immediately subjected to resuscitation. 
Cholera means--forgive me for the coarse but necessary 
details--endless diarrhea, which dehydrates the body so much 
that end come in just a few hours. It looks like the doctors 
were able to bring Shabunov back. But in Kaspiysk (Dagestan), 
they weren't able to save the patient. And in the republic 
hospital in Makhachkala, they are not caring for a 4-month 
infant with the same diagnosis. Just in July and August of this 
year 17 patients and vibrio carriers were registered; these 
cases are associated with cholera imported from India, Pakistan 
and Turkey. We'll talk about imports a little later. In the 
meantime persons returning from shopping tours with their 
``acquisition'' have homes in very many places--Nizhniy 
Novgorod, Krasnodar, Makhachkala, Naberezhnyye Chelny. 
  And besides cholera, typhoid fever, which we haven't seen in 
our country for a long time, has made its appearance. 
Eighty-seven persons were hospitalized for it in Volgodonsk, 
Rostov Oblast. Specialists from the State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight limited their information to 
the indicated cases. But the geography of the infection and the 
list of patients are more extensive. We possess data indicating 
that local medical workers in Astrakhan and Barnaul discovered 
anthrax agents in food products. Some people have already 
contracted the disease. The situation with this infection 
recalls especially clearly the ``Solovyev effect'' with which we 
began our discussion--a doctor's behavior in extreme 
circumstances. A peasant family in the Astrakhan town of 
Dianovka was forced to slaughter a sick calf. The local 
veterinarian could be diagnosed with a lack of knowledge or 
conscience, but he deemed the meet to be fit for consumption. A 
few days later those who slaughtered the animal and sold its 
meat heard of their unconditional diagnosis--anthrax. A 
quarantine was announced in Dianovka. And in another town as 
well--Tundrikha, Altay Kray. Here also they slaughtered a sick 
animal and sold the meat uninspected. Efforts are being made to 
save the sick. Cattle, sheep and horses are undergoing mass 
vaccination. The financially strapped sanitary-epidemiological 
oversight agency contained the epidemic of the terrible disease. 
But in this case millions of rubles were spent on medicines, 
vaccinations of animals, and disinfection. 
  The term ``negligence'' is often applied to trading in 
uninspected infected meat. But does that tell the whole story? 
Do we say anything about the social causes that encourage some 
to sell and others to buy meat that is now as precious as gold? 
It's probably a little cheaper when it doesn't bear a seal of 
inspection. Why not risk your health if you didn't have to buy 
it, and you got it free? 
  When misfortune comes to our door, contrary to popular 
wisdom 
we lock it, and rather tightly. But aren't we acting a little 
too late? After all many things can and must be foreseen. The 
same goes for imported infections. Given the present openness of 
borders, and the scale of goods traffic, we should have adopted 
the corresponding law protecting Russian Federation territory 
from importation of diseases by people, animals and plants long 
ago (most other countries have such laws). But in our country 
this law just now being written in response to a government 
decree, which was itself adopted in May, just before lightning 
struck. 
  Nor is it any news that migration and refugees represent a 
potential source of all kinds of diseases. And of course, we are 
well aware of the general ecological situation, particularly 
when it comes to water, about which even our recently initiated 
``Retsept'' subsection has written on several occasions. We've 
already cited a figure: Half (!) of Russia's inhabitants drink 
water that does not meet hygienic requirement, water that is 
simply unfit to drink. And this after all is the primary source 
of intestinal infection, cholera in particular. As it became 
known, the person that died in Kaspiysk fell ill because he 
drank untreated water. Accidents with water supply lines have 
grown more frequent, and water treatment has worsened due to the 
absence of reagents and disinfectants. The epidemiological 
service is still managing to somehow keep the situation under 
control through constant laboratory monitoring and continual 
inspections. But it no longer as the money for reagents, or to 
pay for electric power. 
  All of these are the misfortunes of civilized cities. But 
throughout Russia there are thousands of towns without water 
purification facilities or sewage systems. In the meantime 
cholera vibrio was detected in open-air water basins last year, 
and is being detected currently as well. Such that the 
biblically simple and so ancient a truth has real meaning to the 
Russian Federation today: Never drink untreated water! And wash 
fruits, vegetables and your hands thoroughly. The drowning must 
save themselves, as the saying goes. 
  The danger of infection is becoming especially acute under 
the conditions of our uncontrolled trade. In our impassable mud. 
We've written about this in ``Retsept'' in the past. Let me add 
that sometimes it seems that sanitary oversight doesn't see what 
we see. But at our request they gave the figures for fines 
imposed for dirt and other violations: Last year--39,000 rubles, 
and in one quarter of this year, R128,000. And this is 
throughout all of Russia, even with the current rate of 
inflation. Sanitary oversight is of course trying, but violators 
are hardly frightened by its only weapon--fines. 
  I am certain that the situation requires new forces, other 
approaches. It's strange that in our democratic times we have 
lost the truly democratic institutions that operated and did 
good things in times past. Public citizen's movements occur in 
many countries. Were our active common citizens to come together 
under public health physicians locally, they could clean up our 
streets and stores under their leadership. And with the support 
of a local peace officer (at least one, for insurance!). It 
would be a sin for the public health physician to earn bruises 
for defending our health. But things like this have happened. 
  And one other thing. We have justly condemned the method of 
struggle that had been so fashionable in years past: A call to 
heroism is usually made when there is no order or system. Still, 
the actions of doctors today are in fact heroic, they are 
restraining the epidemiological situation at the same time that 
in Moscow there are only just a few kilograms of special soda 
for intravenous infusions, and when there are not enough salt 
solutions and other--let me emphasize that!--of the simplest, 
most elementary resources. 
  You can't reduce the number of persons without permanent 
residence (it's increasing) or eliminate migration of refugees 
overnight. But all of these people simply have to undergo 
disinfection procedures. The older generation can remember the 
medical checkpoints that were present in all Moscow terminals. 
But today transport workers sadly admit that they can't, there's 
no money. A couple were recently added to the only other one in 
the city. Not much. And anyway, how are you going to force all 
of the homeless to undergo personal cleansing? 
  Cholera and mushrooms don't seem to be related. But 
mushrooms 
are another misfortune hanging over our heads. Once again, like 
last summer, people are dying from mushroom poisoning. In Tambov 
Oblast there were 46 victims and 8 fatalities. In Voronezh 
Oblast there were 52 poisonings and 1 fatality. In Lipetsk--23 
victims, 4 fatalities. A dubious theory about radionuclides, 
pesticides and heavy metals trapped by mushrooms, obviously 
having its origins in the widely read writing of Veronika 
Mavrikiyevna, is still circulating among the people since last 
year. All last winter scientists conducted research on the 
subject, but science has been unable to confirm Mavrikiyevna's 
theory. Everything is simpler and more frightening: People died 
and are now dying from toxin produced by the death cup. And 
there's more. A selective inspection revealed those same death 
cups in the one out of every 8-10 baskets brought home this 
summer mushroom gatherers. Specialists are sounding the alarm. A 
guide for mushroom gatherers drawn up by the Scientific Research 
Institute of Nutrition of the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences is published below at their request. 
  And in conclusion I would like to address readers who may be 
shocked by the expression ``infection [zaraza]'' I have been 
using. We have forgotten this ancient, age-old term, and 
substituted it by the foppish euphemism ``infection 
[infektsiya].'' However, I think that the harsher word 
``zaraza'' fits the alarming situation in Russia better today.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Kippel: ``Chicken-Pox Behind Barbed Wire''] </F>
  [Text] The reader will of course be amazed: What sort 
of medical phenomenon is this, has a classical children's 
disease really grown older. No, the problem is not the aging of 
nursery-school chicken-pox, but that the ``contingent behind 
barbed wire'' has gotten younger. This didn't happen overnight, 
by the way. It was not just yesterday that the juvenile 
detention and distribution centers were created, where police 
stand guard over youngsters from 3 to 18 years old behind high 
walls and barbed wire. This is simply the sign of our troubled, 
unhappy times, when gunfire is heard on your own street, when 
your father is taken hostage, when a youngster is tempted with 
lots of money, and an 8-year-old girl is made to lie down for 
sex--these days, life is increasingly more strained in juvenile 
detention centers, and the stories of their lodgers are becoming 
ever more bitter. 
  In the one I visited, young Muscovites, their neighbors from 
the capital's oblast, and youngsters from adjacent countries are 
serving their standard 30-day sentences. Up to 50 young 
runaways, criminals and prostitutes are delivered daily. Here 
they undergo a unique kind of sorting: Some are returned home, 
while others are sent to correction facilities when their guilt 
is established. 
  What typifies this unfortunate contingent today? First of 
all, its rising numbers. In previous years the number brought in 
daily was half of what it is now. If the flow doesn't lessen, 
the center workers assert that it will be impossible to deal 
with it. All the more so because the children's collective has 
to undergo quarantine. There are those with chicken-pox, as 
mentioned above, those with German measles, and those with 
hepatitis. No quarantine is imposed here on venereal diseases. 
Practically one out of every two young boys or girls has 
gonorrhea. They ``love'' this disease, and they try to catch it 
on purpose, so that while en route to the venereal disease 
hospital many of them could escape from the ambulances. They 
also flee from the hospital--it isn't kept under guard, after 
all. 
  Who are these children, these inhabitants of the juvenile 
detention center, these unfortunate youngsters, our hope for the 
future, lousy and plagued by scabies, brought in from train 
stations, and caught in basements and attics? 
  The main group, from 7 to 11 years of age, consists of 
``travelers.'' There are children from 3 to 18 years of age who 
have left home for various reasons. An unsettled home life, 
perpetual drunkenness of parents, and now more rarely a child's 
longing to see the world, compel the children to abandon the 
hearth and set off on a distant journey of tens and even 
hundreds of kilometers, without money or clothing. They travel 
chiefly in trains, on baggage shelves or in vestibules. As they 
travel their long road, people give them food and money. But 
when all of this ends, they begin to steal. In train stations 
the guests to the capital come together into juvenile gangs, 
which then disrobe and rob other adolescents, and sometimes even 
adults, if they are drunk. Fourteen-year-old Sasha rode in from 
the Urals. A man at the train station asked him: ``Do you want 
to earn some money? You can sell beer.'' And so a new 
``station'' life begins. Money, lots of it. The children steal 
from passers-by and divide the loot among themselves. And when 
there's extra money, you can drink, and you can spend some time 
with the young girls in the station--there are many of them 
here, and they're cheap. 
  Station girls are 14-16 years old for the most part, but 
recently 12-year-olds are encountered more often as well. 
  The station life of an adolescent doesn't last long--the 
police catch the children and send them to the detention and 
distribution center. Here they are bathed, deloused, fed and 
sent for treatment. In 6 months the center housed 2,812 persons; 
1,582 of these children were returned to their parents. To those 
who hadn't had their parental rights taken away from them. To 
those who could be located. In recent months many children have 
been arriving from zones of conflict. It is becoming 
increasingly more difficult to send them back home. Inquiries 
take a long time, and often without success. The center's 
associates work on the basis of personal contacts--after all, 
prior to the USSR's disintegration they had worked in this 
system for several years, and so old ties and acquaintances help 
to solve the problems. The question is, how much longer will 
this system work? In the Baltic states, in Georgia and in 
Chechen, there is a unique attitude toward children from the 
detention center. An Estonian or Georgian child will be picked 
up quickly, while a Russian one is not, because, they say, its 
parents are part of an occupying force. 
  The children go around here in pairs. To lunch, and for 
exercise, under the escort of police. As I looked at these pairs 
under convoy, I experienced pain and shame. Days go by, but the 
pain and the shame do not pass.

  [Text] Only mass vaccination of the population in 17 of 
Russia's epidemiologically most vulnerable regions will be able 
to stop the diphtheria epidemic. Such is the opinion of RF 
Deputy Minister of Health Aleksey Moskvichev, director of the 
diphtheria control headquarters established under the Russian 
Ministry of Health. 
  Microbiologists believe, he said, that a new strain of 
disease has appeared, making the situation so acute: Just 
between August and September the incidence of disease tripled. 
Today the number of persons hospitalized is nearing 8,000, and 
270 persons have died. In the opinion of specialists the serious 
situation will last into January, and it will not be normalized 
completely for another 2-4 years. 
  Aleksey Moskvichev communicated that anti-diphtheria serum 
producers were given help in increasing their production of the 
preparation back in August. But the preparation cycle lasts half 
a year, and there's no time to wait. Consequently the Ministry 
of Health opted for major purchases for hard currency: Thirty 
thousand vials of serum were purchased abroad, and they will be 
placed at the disposal of public health agencies within a week. 
Doctors will receive a second such lot before 1 January 1994.

  [Text] MOSCOW. The health of the Russian population is 
deteriorating, and in 5 years mortality may twice exceed the 
birth rate. Such is the forecast made at a conference of 
directors of RF public health agencies just ending in Moscow. 
The participants of the conference concluded that public health 
services in all regions are in a disastrous state, and they are 
essentially breaking down, while health care is becoming 
increasingly less available to the population. The incidence of 
measles almost quadrupled this year, that of typhoid fever 
increased by a factor of 2.2, and diphtheria is assuming the 
nature of an epidemic: The number of patients is nearing 8,000. 
Two hundred seventy-five persons have died, to include 54 
children.

<F P=106> [Article: ``Russian State Committee for </F>
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight Troubled by the Health of 
Children'' 
  [Text] The Russian State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight expressed extreme concern for 
the health of Russians, primarily children. In the words of 
Yevgeniy Belyayev, the committee chairman, just in 9 months of 
this year the incidence of measles in Russia increased by 4.2 
times, that of whooping cough increased by 29 percent, and that 
of epidemiological parotitis grew by 31 percent in comparison 
with the same period of last year. 
  In 1993, 10 outbreaks of dysentery, typhoid fever, hepatitis 
and salmonellosis were noted in the country, as a result of 
which around 7,000 persons became sick. Diphtheria is assuming 
epidemic proportions: The number of patients with this infection 
has reached 5,000, and around 300 patients have died, to include 
50 children. 
  In Yevgeniy Belyayev's opinion this situation is the result 
of the unfavorable state of the environment, a decrease in the 
immune status of Russian, the failure to immunize many children 
and adults, and the shortage of vitamins and of therapeutic and 
preventive drugs. According to information from the ``Kedr'' 
constructive ecology movement, which is cooperating actively 
with the country's epidemiological services, around 60,000 
Russian citizens are living today in places where the maximum 
permissible concentrations of toxic substances are perpetually 
exceeded. Levels of atmospheric contamination exceeding the 
maximum permissible concentrations by 10 times are periodically 
recorded in over 80 of the country's cities and industrial 
centers. Each year around 28 cubic kilometers of contaminated 
liquid wastes are dumped into Russia's water basins, including 
8.4 cubic kilometers untreated. Highly toxic organic compounds, 
salts of heavy metals, phenols and petroleum products are 
detected in water sources. 
  In the words of Anatoliy Panfilov, chairman of the ``Kedr'' 
movement, the threat to the health of the population, primarily 
children, motivated its members to start a drive to purchase 
from other countries a large quantity of medical preparations 
that raise immunity, and equipment with which to make them in 
Russia. After the needed pharmaceuticals are acquired, 
specialists of the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological 
Oversight will deliver them with the help of active members of 
the ``Kedr'' movement to citizens needing them most in the 
threatened regions.

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Veldina: ``AIDS: Not Yet an Epidemic, </F>
But...''] 
  [Text] It's not my habit to read newspapers in 
the metro. So, having eyed the tired, ordinary faces opposite 
me, I raised my gaze to an advertisement inviting us to be 
tested in the AIDS diagnosis office of the Institute imeni 
Sklifosovskiy. I liked the invitation. Not in the sense that I 
had any apprehensions about myself but because the entire 
procedure cost three ice creams--150 rubles. 
  We don't see huge columns of tragic numbers at the 
Sklifosovskiy Institute's laboratory of clinical immunology and 
AIDS diagnosis yet, thank God. This year only six persons were 
registered with a positive HIV test, two of them being 
foreigners. (Let's compare with previous years: eight persons in 
1991, five of whom were foreign students, and 13 in 1992, to 
include 10 of our fellow countrymen). 
  Approximately 85 percent of all tests represent those 
carried 
out officially and mandatorily prior to surgical operations, or 
those necessary for travel abroad. The rest are anonymous, from 
60 to 100 persons a day. 
  Sergey Kudryashov, a doctor and a lab technician, can't say 
yet that AIDS has reached epidemic proportions. But there are of 
course no grounds for reassurance. If the figures of this 
laboratory may be considered to be not entirely indicative, here 
are data from the Russian AIDS Control Center: 650 Russian 
citizens infected with immunodeficiency virus have been 
registered, and 81 persons have already died as of the beginning 
of this year. Foreigners make up an extremely substantial 
number--421 (since 1987). In this case 82 infected former Soviet 
citizens were registered in 1991, 85 were registered in 1992, 
and this year just 38 have been registered as yet. There were 13 
foreigners in 1991, 26 in 1992 and three in 1993. 
  As you can see, while the number of infected persons is 
steadily rising, an abrupt increase has not yet occurred. Vadim 
Pokrovskiy, the director of the Russian AIDS Control Center, 
feels that this is associated with the effectiveness of certain 
measures, as a result of which the natural transmission pathway 
has now been practically closed off. Thus, since 1987 not a 
single case of infection with the virus during blood transfusion 
has occurred. Infections arising as a result of the use of dirty 
syringes have not occurred since 1990. However, sexual 
transmission of the infection is gaining momentum. Of the total 
number of adults possessing the immunodeficiency virus 30 
percent are women. Homosexuals are not far behind. Their share 
is 30-40 percent. What is surprising is that not a single case 
of infection associated with drug use has yet been registered. 
  ``What we need first of all is effective 
prevention--training 
and education,'' said Vadim Pokrovskiy. 
  It wouldn't be bad for the government and the Supreme Soviet 
to remember this. After all, a state AIDS control program still 
hasn't been adopted.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Vladimir Androsenko: ``Forgotten </F>
Diseases Are Returning With Poverty''] 
  [Text] Cases of people dying from long-forgotten tubercular 
meningitis were noted in Yakutia in 1992. Other forms of 
diseases that had fallen into oblivion have grown in frequency 
as well--tuberculosis of bones, joints and lymph nodes, while 
the overall infection rate of the population by Koch's 
tubercular bacillus is reaching a once unprecedented 
value--70-80 percent. 
  The disease is selective: It strikes mainly the poor. Its 
widespread occurrence in the North is explained by the fact that 
the overwhelming part of the local population has begun eating 
much more poorly. Weakened by low-calorie food and avitaminosis, 
the body is unable to resist infection.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Golyayev: ``Children, Health, Prices''] </F>
  [Text] The headquarters of the Federation of 
Independent Russian Trade Unions held a meeting on the problems 
of organizing summer vacations for children and preserving the 
population's health. 
  The prices of vacation passes have risen abruptly, and the 
costs of maintaining a single vacationer increased last year by 
almost 40 times in comparison with 1991. The average cost of a 
pass exceeds the minimum wage set by the government 15 times. 
The closing and respecialization of health improvement 
institutions, including children's, have assumed threatening 
proportions, their construction has been halted for practical 
purposes, and health institutions are being sold off at 
bargain-basement prices. 
  Diseases such as poliomyelitis, diphtheria and tularemia, 
which had not been registered at all in Russia for many years, 
have reappeared among children. Over 1,300 illnesses occur 
annually in every 1,000 children and adolescents. Of 42 million 
children, only 10-14 percent come to primary school healthy. 
  A resolution adopted at the meeting called for developing 
the 
``Russian Health Resorts'' and ``Children's Vacations'' 
programs, and offering tax advantages and preferential loans to 
enterprises of the sanatorium and health resort complex. There 
are plans for establishing a republican reserve fund from which 
to compensate the expenses of travel to vacation places, and 
part of the cost of passes. The participants of the meeting 
concluded that there was a need for creating permanent 
interregional commissions on organizing vacations for children 
and laborers.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Stadnik: ``'Dirty Syringes'--Not the Only </F>
Cause of AIDS Infection''] 
  [Text] There were 268 of them--children infected with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in hospitals of Elista, Volgograd, 
Rostov and Stavropol. The outbreak that occurred in the south of 
Russia in 1988-1989 raised the country right away to the same 
level as the rest of the world, which had long known the 
pleasures of AIDS. At the same time it emphasized our 
vulnerability even here: Rather than having the disease occur in 
risk groups in large cities, we got AIDS as a children's 
epidemic in provincial, out-of-the-way places. But if only that 
were the only problem! In the last 5 years some of the infected 
children have managed to become adults, but no one is yet 
certain that such an outbreak will not occur in our country 
again. 
  The official explanation was given very quickly--infection 
occurred due to the absence of disposable syringes and poor 
sterilization of reusable ones. This was the version presented 
by Vadim Pokrovskiy, the director of the All-Union AIDS 
Prevention Laboratory. It took him several days in Elista, where 
mass infection was first detected, to reach this conclusion. 
This version was actively supported, including at the 
international level, by Valentin Pokrovskiy, president of the 
USSR (now the Russian) Academy of Medical Sciences. 
  An entire boom of purchasing disposable syringes has passed 
(as an example Yeltsin brought 100,000 from England, paid for by 
an honorarium for his book), and production in this country was 
organized. Concurrently it seem as if the chain of infections 
that led to the single adult infection in the Elista hospital, 
which started it all, was untangled. With this, official 
medicine relaxed. But here's what's strange--the unprecedented 
mass outbreak of hospital infection has rather distinct bounds: 
It began in mid-1988, and ended in the middle of the next year. 
There were still not enough syringes, the investigation was 
still ongoing, but the infections had already ceased, as if 
someone had dropped the boom in the virus's path. 
  Just 2 years ago physicians of one of the ``capitals'' of 
children's AIDS, Rostov, said: ``Syringes are far from always to 
blame. If a child that was already infected was lying in the 
first floor of the hospital, then another who was on the fourth 
floor at this time, and who was infected at the same time, 
couldn't have received the virus from him. Syringes don't 
circulate between floors and wards.'' The question, asked in 
amazement, ``So how could he have been infected?'', was usually 
followed by a long stare, leaving the dilettante bewildered. 
  Nobody wanted to talk in Rostov back then, and no one 
especially wants to today. But there are grounds for this. In 
1989 the AIDS laboratory of the Rostov Plague Institute began 
its own investigation of the circumstances behind the infection 
of the children, which didn't fit with the official ``dirty 
syringes'' version. Its associates turned their attention to the 
fact that immunoglobulin had been administered to most of the 
infected children in the hospital. This preparation is made from 
blood, including placental blood, which is taken from women 
during labor. No one asks the female donors for their consent 
for this--as a rule, they are not even informed that the 
procedure is taking place. A maximum of 100 milliliters is 
obtained from one person, while an industrial lot consists of 
over 100 liters. One can imagine how many people have been 
``mixed together'' to create the preparation. The shelf life is 
limited. After it expires, anything left over is scrapped. 
  In several series of experiments the laboratory diligently 
reproduced the immunoglobulin production procedure after first 
infecting the raw material with the virus. As a result in the 
second series of experiments the virus was still alive in the 
fifth, or second-to-last, production stage. It should be 
considered that the laboratory meticulously adhered to the 
procedure, which requires, in addition to other things, the use 
of alcohol. How strictly it was observed in industry, under the 
conditions of the fight that was going on then against 
alcoholism, remains only to be guessed. 
  The first results were communicated at a meeting of Rostov's 
extraordinary epidemic commission by the institute director, 
Yuriy Lomov. And literally just a couple of weeks later the 
order came from Moscow, from the Main Administration of 
Quarantine Infections of the USSR Ministry of Health, to close 
the AIDS laboratory of the plague institute ``as being not 
consistent with its profile.'' The two series of experiments 
were the only ones completed. 
  Mikhail Norkevich, who was then the director of the main 
administration, now heads the AIDS control department of the 
Russian Ministry of Health. He categorically rejects the 
immunoglobulin version. He has his own arguments for this. Nor 
does Vadim Pokrovskiy recognize it. We weren't able to learn his 
reasons, because he refused to talk with this journalist. But 
neither ever gave reasonable explanations why this study of an 
alternative approach had to be stopped quickly and at its roots. 
  One of the main arguments against the danger of infection by 
way of immunoglobulin is that the initial blood is tested for 
AIDS. It is in fact tested for antibodies. But between infection 
and the appearance of antibodies, there is a ``dead zone'' of 
from 3 weeks to 3 months, during which tests are blind. If 
infection and pregnancy occur simultaneously, this would be 
precisely the time period during which women would go in for an 
abortion, at which time blood would be taken. 
  There is one other argument--the procedure itself, which 
consists of six stages, kills the virus. However, in 1984 HIV 
was detected in such a blood preparation in the USA. Since that 
time the finished product undergoes a seventh stage 
there--processing by gamma-radiation, which kills every living 
thing. This is a 100 percent guarantee, and it also saves on 
tests to determine the quality of the blood and the end product. 
On the backdrop of the punctures formerly suffered by the by-far 
more procedurally precise and disciplined Americans, the 
calmness of AIDS fighters in Moscow appears, in the least, as 
not too justifiably presumptuous. 
  It seemed as if the disbelief of Rostov doctors in the sole 
true version of infection was fated to remain at the level of 
talk--no one is eager to stick his neck out when the two highest 
AIDS officials are avidly interested in preserving only one 
cause. But it turned out that there is an unrelated power 
interested in conclusive investigation of all the details. The 
procuracy in Rostov has been conducting an investigation since 
the moment the first infected individuals were revealed. 
  Examining magistrate Valeriy Lysenko is rather cautious: 
``Clarification of the causes of infection is still continuing. 
The personal opinion of no individual, even the most 
authoritative, can be considered to be the truth until all of 
the details are clarified.'' And there is plenty that is 
unclear: For example, there has been no sanitary-epidemiological 
analysis of infection in Rostov Oblast. The investigation 
conducted its own expert examination at the Rostov Oblast 
Children's Hospital, where 44 children were infected (a total of 
99 children were infected in the oblast, and 75 remain alive). 
After meticulous examination of all cases the experts brought in 
by the procuracy concluded that for practical purposes not a 
single child could have been infected by a syringe from the 
infected girl from Elista who was also lying in this hospital. 
  After this conclusion the procuracy began searching for the 
lots of immunoglobulin sent to Rostov in the middle of 1988, and 
scrapped a year later. Control samples are supposed to remain in 
the factories making the blood preparations, but the suspected 
factories remain silent. 
  In the meantime one other fact that may turn even the local 
version of infection several degrees in who knows what direction 
fell into the lap of the procuracy. Until quite recently there 
were eight infected adults in Rostov Oblast. One man, and the 
rest women. The husband of one of the women divorced her after 
the diagnosis, while another three women became pregnant (after 
the diagnosis!) and gave birth, leaving their husbands healthy 
in this case. 
  And it became clear just recently that there should be many 
more infected adults in Rostov. Following the death of Gennadi 
Ilchenko, the director of the oblast's main medical school, it 
was revealed that he had been ill with AIDS since 1985. While he 
was alive he was known as a person who could use his official 
position to his advantage. As it now turns out, not only 
materially but even physically. After the cause of his death was 
announced, both male and female students, past and present, and 
even instructors at the school, who had managed to have 
relations with the deceased director, appeared for testing at 
the oblast AIDS centers. The scandal is growing in Rostov's 
medical circles. However, it turns out that what was a secret in 
Rostov was known for a long time in Moscow. Ilchenko had been on 
record at the hospital on Sokolinaya Hill, presently the Russian 
Scientific and Teaching Center for AIDS, since 1987. It was 
then, and is now, under the command of Vadim Pokrovskiy, who (no 
one in Rostov doubts this) set up treatment for Ilchenko without 
publicity. Unauthorized people shouldn't know about an AIDS 
diagnosis, but even the chief physician didn't know about this 
in the oblast AIDS center, which takes care of Rostov Oblast. 
Two persons infected by Ilchenko have been revealed in Rostov 
thus far. But few doubt that this is only the beginning. 
  People infected by the chief of the medical school may be at 
any of the oblast's therapeutic institutions. Including at blood 
transfusion stations, and in children's hospitals. The procuracy 
is preparing to investigate a new version of the possible mass 
infections--by way of infected medical workers. 
  As for what conclusions will be reached by the 
investigation, 
which has gotten into a matter that is not in its typical line 
of work, time will tell. But until medicine opts to investigate 
all versions at a serious scientific level, not one of us can be 
assured that new hospital infections won't break out.

<F P=106> [Article by Lidiya Ivchenko: ``The Water Is Becoming </F>
Dangerous''] 
  [Text] There was a time when water from 
the tap could be drunk in peace, even unboiled. Unfortunately 
today this is only an apparent state of well-being: Last year 16 
outbreaks of infections from which almost 2,500 persons suffered 
were registered in Russia at the fault of water supply 
systems. 
  What we are talking about in this case is only the mass 
outbreaks, in which the number of victims is in the tens and 
hundreds; this is not including the isolated cases, or ones 
which may be classified as causing minor unpleasantness, like 
water in Moscow in spring. However, water recently flowed from 
Moscow's taps with the obvious odor of manure. 
  ``This phenomenon has already become a tradition,'' said A. 
Rogovets, chief specialist on water supply problems of the State 
Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. ``The moment 
spring begins, you have manure in the water sources.... The 
farms violate the procedures of applying organic fertilizers to 
fields: Rather than trucking them in in fall, before the snow 
falls, they do so in winter, applying them over the snow. The 
thaw begins, and everything flows into the water basin, rather 
than penetrating into the soil.'' 
  In order for the quality of drinking water to be high, the 
source itself must first correspond to sanitary requirements. 
But when it comes to our water basins, the question is, what 
isn't in them--toxic chemical compounds, heavy metal salts, 
phenols, viruses, agents of parasitic diseases.... Today one out 
of every eight samples of tap water is unsatisfactory with 
respect to bacteriological indicators, while one out of every 
five is unsatisfactory in its chemical indicators, due to 
incomplete treatment that is unable to cope with massive 
contamination of sources. Of the water pipelines taking water 
from open-air water basins in the country, 44.4 percent do not 
have the full complement of treatment facilities, while in 
Arkhangelsk Oblast, Karelia and the Volga region a third of the 
water supply facilities supply water without decontamination. 
  On the whole, around half of Russia's population is forced 
to 
use drinking water that fails the hygienic requirements in 
relation to a number of indicators. And the water supply nets 
are so worn that the number of accidents reaches 75,000 per 
year. Why should we be amazed if infections rise here and there, 
and the sanitary-epidemiological service has to quench the 
flames under emergency conditions? 
  ``The epidemiological danger of drinking water is growing,'' 
said Yevgeniy Belyayev, chairman of the State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. ``Each year cubic kilometers 
of untreated or insufficiently treated liquid wastes are dumped 
into water basins. The Don has already transformed into a 
settling tank, and cholera is registered along its shores in 
population centers just about every year. Due to intestinal 
infections and hepatitis the Russian economy has suffered losses 
of 1 billion rubles annually in 1991 prices; today this is 
probably in the hundreds of billions. But infections are not the 
only problem. Drinking water now contains chemical and other 
toxic impurities in amounts dangerous to health. Were we to 
monitor water quality not on the basis of the 28 leading 
indicators of our All-Union State Standard, but by the 100 
recommended by WHO, which suggests stiffer norms for the 
concentrations of lead, arsenic, cyanides and other such 
impurities, I'm certain that drinking water would fail the 
standards in 90 percent of the cases. But in order to carry out 
deeper analysis, we need a dependable monitoring system, which 
we don't have.'' 
  As we can see, there are many problems in this area. A 
meeting of the presidium of the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences held jointly with the State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight was devoted--for the first 
time!--to the critical water supply situation. This meeting was 
held because, in the words of academy President V. Pokrovskiy, 
we are talking about the nation's future. 
`` Research by Russian and foreign scientists has now revealed 
the presence of a new class of biologically active compounds in 
contaminated water, called DV molecules,'' said Academician V. 
Pokrovskiy. ``These substances of microbial origin, which are 
released by natural acquatic inhabitants when conditions are 
unfavorable to their life--as defensive, adaptive reactions--are 
dangerous to human health, and have a deleterious effect upon 
the immune system and other body functions. And modern water 
treatment technology does not permit their complete removal.'' 
  Scientists will soon submit their recommendations on 
sanitary 
norms and rules, in accordance with which the All-Union State 
Standard will be reviewed. Twelve new monitoring indicators are 
to be introduced just for organic impurities in water. The State 
Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, the State 
Standards Committee and the Committee for Housing and Municipal 
Management of the Russian Ministry of Construction have written 
a draft of the Russian Federation law ``On Providing Drinking 
Water to the Population,'' which was submitted to the Supreme 
Soviet for examination. 
  And until the law is enacted, and until the program is 
implemented, it would be worthwhile to acquire individual 
filters to purify tap water.

  [Text] Perhaps the most serious problem in Moscow now is 
diphtheria. Just in the last 8 months 995 persons caught this 
disease in the capital, at the same time that there were only 
424 patients in all of last year. Nor are the statistics of 
deaths due to this disease encouraging--this year 56 persons 
died of diphtheria, which is more than double last year's 
``record.'' By the way, diphtheria is now ``mowing'' adults 
primarily. This is associated with a drop in the population's 
immune defense. The fact is that immunizations against this 
disease are effective for not more than 10 years. After this 
time, they must be repeated; otherwise there is no avoiding the 
disease. However, our people now shy away from this one word 
``immunization''--they fear catching something more serious.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Sotnikova: ``Businessmen Also in the </F>
'Risk Group'''] 
  [Text] KOMMERSANT-DAILY has addressed the problem of 
growth of the incidence of diphtheria in Moscow several times, 
but yesterday Moscow's Main Medical Administration communicated 
to a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the diphtheria epidemic 
has reached threatening proportions in the city. Last week 147 
persons infected by this disease were brought to the hospital. 
The diphtheria situation is no less complex in the Moscow 
suburbs. 
  According to specialists the growth of the incidence of 
diphtheria is explained on one hand by the fact that ``a total 
victory over diphtheria by medical personnel in the USSR'' was 
officially announced in the mid-1970s, which led to an 
unexcusable decrease in attention toward this disease. On the 
other hand the debate that arose several years ago in the press 
on vaccinations forced many to avoid precautionary measures 
which they felt to be unsafe. As a result a rise began in the 
disease in countries of the former USSR in the mid-1980s. 
  Moscow is one of the most dangerous regions from the 
standpoint of development of a diphtheria epidemic. Since the 
beginning of this year 1,140 cases of illness were recorded, 
including 234 among children. (For comparison: In all of last 
year 774 diphtheria patients, including 123 children, were 
registered by institutions of the city's Main Medical 
Administration.) At first glance the situation in the Moscow 
suburbs does not seem so frightening--316 patients in 8 months; 
however, even this figure is double that for all of 1992. 
  According to specialists of the city's Main Medical 
Administration a certain decline in the epidemic was noted in 
July-August, associated primarily with the vacation season; 
however, growth of the number of patients was registered in late 
August. A total of 56 persons succumbed to this infectious 
disease in Moscow; four of them were children. According to 
unofficial data each week an average of two or three persons die 
from diphtheria in Moscow. In the opinion of medical personnel 
death is guaranteed almost 100 percent for anyone who falls ill 
and is not immunized against diphtheria. 
  The social status of diphtheria patients has changed 
considerably: While last year 100 percent of persons dying from 
diphtheria were chronic alcoholic patients, now this disaster 
has fallen upon new social groups. The risk carried by those 
whose professional responsibilities include communicating with 
broad strata of people is greater than that of others. 
Specialists agree unanimously that the sole solution to the 
situation is diphtheria immunization, which may be obtained in 
both a rayon polyclinic and in hard-currency clinics and medical 
centers.

  [Text] An outbreak of cholera in Kazakhstan and its 
importation into Moscow, anthrax in Rostov, tick-borne 
encephalitis in Voronezh, diphtheria in most large cities, and 
an even wider geography of dysentery, salmonellosis, 
tuberculosis and pediculosis. Diseases which were a rarity just 
a few years ago have now increased in frequency, and this cannot 
but be alarming, since after all, these are infectious, 
dangerous illnesses. Some of them are acquiring epidemic 
proportions, as is evidenced by statistics of the State 
Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. While in 8 
months of last year only 1,801 persons caught diphtheria in 
Russia, in the same period of this year there have been as many 
as 5,888 cases, including 1,459 children. Since the beginning of 
the year 254 persons have died. Dysentery morbidity grew from 
73,628 cases to 89,238. The number of syphilis patients almost 
tripled in comparison with last year--there are 25,599 of them. 
Of 194,833 gonorrhea patients registered in 8 months of this 
year, 1,601 are children up to 14 years of age. And even 
pediculosis--ordinary lousiness, which threatens typhus--has 
gone beyond the 181,000 mark. These, by the way, are only the 
cases that have been recorded by the sanitary-epidemiological 
service, while in actual fact the infections may be much more 
widespread. 
  It is clear that all of these outbreaks, foci and epidemics 
are not the result of the good life. Nikolay Vladimirovich 
Shestopalov, the administrative chief of the State 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Service of the State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, provides a concrete 
explanation for the causes of the country's epidemic danger. 
[Shestopalov]The gates of neighboring and distant 
countries have been flung wide open, and the number of people 
crossing the federation's borders, including from countries in 
which cholera is a problem, has increased considerably. I am 
referring to people on business, commercial and tourist trips. 
In addition many refugees, persons without a permanent place of 
residence and vagrants spending the nights in terminals, cellars 
and attics have appeared. Such a backdrop favors the spread of 
infections. 
  People busy with what they believe to be the more important 
problems of survival have become less responsible about their 
own health, and they are not taking reasonable precautions 
against infections. Public health in general and the 
sanitary-epidemiological service in particular do not have 
enough resources for normal preventive work: Because of 
insufficient and late financing we are unable to carry out all 
of the necessary measures fully--medical checkups, analyses, 
disinfection, vaccination etc. But speaking in general, 
political, economic and social crises inevitably lead to 
complication of the epidemic situation in any society undergoing 
periods of change, and what we observe in our country today 
confirms this. 
[Kudinova]That's true, and if we recall history, 
beginning with the ``childhood of mankind,'' or the Age of 
Antiquity, epidemics, or ``mory'' as they were referred to in 
the distant past, always accompanied upheavals in a state. They 
were viewed in cultures of different peoples and centuries in 
the same way--as the vengeance and punishment of the gods, as 
``divine punishment.'' Naturally the mechanisms of monitoring 
and curtailing the spread of infection can no longer work well 
in connection with economic devastation, but could it also be 
that the defense mechanisms of the human body also break down? 
After all, pathogenic viruses and microbes exist in stable 
periods of history as well, but they don't always evoke massive 
epidemic disease. 
[Shestopalov]If we're talking about the laws by which 
epidemics arise, we should recall the well known physiologist 
Selye, who justified the theory of stress. Stress is the body's 
natural defense reaction to an external effect, as a rule a 
response to a situation differing from normal. Stress mobilizes 
the body's defensive forces. But stress has its antipode as 
well--distress. This is excessive, over-the-line stress, which 
lasts abnormally long and which ultimately results in inhibition 
of defensive forces. The economic and political instability of 
recent years, the lack of social protections for the population, 
the decrease in standard of living, local wars and conflicts in 
different places in our country, uncertainty in tomorrow--aren't 
these enough reasons for distress? The immunity of the people is 
suppressed, there is no barrier to diseases, and consequently 
the individual easily catches ailments to which he is exposed, 
and infections he encounters. 
[Kudinova]Distress is still present, and obviously it 
is threatening us with epidemics of even greater scale, since 
after all, judging from your statistics, morbidity is growing. 
What are sanitary-epidemiological oversight services doing to 
keep the situation from getting out of control? 
[Shestopalov]In order to carry out preventive work to 
the fullest, we are trying to preserve the structure and 
function of our services to the maximum, although this is 
requiring colossal effort: There is nothing with which to pay 
for gasoline, electric power and building rent, and there is not 
enough money to acquire instruments, reagents, nutrient media 
and equipment. We appealed to the government, and it supported 
us: Local bodies of government were asked to allocate resources 
as a separate item in support of regional and local or municipal 
programs for supporting sanitary and epidemiological well-being. 
These programs focus on different things: In some areas, 
treatment of drinking water, in others, inspection of food 
products, in still others, massive preventive vaccination, and 
so on. 
  We also received permission to use, for the needs of our 
service, from 50 to 100 percent of fines we impose on officials 
and legal entities guilty of violating public health and 
epidemiological regulations. Moreover despite the fact that this 
is an extremely complex period, and perhaps the not most 
suitable one, we are nonetheless reorganizing our service in 
order to make it more responsive to the needs of society. We are 
establishing special interregional centers--toxicological, 
chemical and microbiological, which will make it possible to 
concentrate our modest possibilities and fulfill a large volume 
of analyses and measurements at a higher level of quality. Had 
it not been for all of these measures, the epidemic situation in 
the country would have been worse. 
  Unfortunately, we are practically unable to influence 
diseases categorized as social diseases--tuberculosis, 
pediculosis, venereal. As we know, they increase in incidence 
unavoidably in territories where the economic and social 
situation is unstable, where ``morality is on the decline.'' As 
an example the statistics on gonorrhea--a disease that is 
suffered as a rule by people in their time of development and 
youth--are only the tip of the iceberg: Many often treat 
themselves with home remedies, without seeing a doctor, causing 
the ailment to assume its chronic form and dooming themselves 
and others to infertility. I can't agree with what is happening 
today in our country in the area of ``sex education.'' My mind 
rebels at calling this a civilized development. 
[Kudinova]What can each person do for him or herself 
to reduce the risk of catching infectious diseases? 
[Shestopalov]Save for observing the elementary rules 
of personal hygiene, there is nothing that I can propose. Wash 
your hands before eating and after going to the bathroom, don't 
use perishable food products after their shelf life has expired, 
don't buy food products, especially meat, from people you don't 
know. When you buy meat (and other food products as well), do so 
only after making sure that it had passed veterinary inspection. 
  And of course, diphtheria immunizations are a doubtless 
requirement. This dangerous infection will remain prominent for 
a sufficiently longer time. The sole effective defense against 
it is immunization. Every immunization is mandatorily preceded 
by an examination by a doctor, it is carried out only with a 
disposable syringe, and the vaccine satisfies the standards of 
the World Health Organization fully, such that immunization is 
absolutely safe to life. Even if a person falls ill due to 
particular features of his body, he will not die of diphtheria, 
and he will not suffer complications. Nor should immunizations 
against tick-borne encephalitis be refused in regions where this 
is necessary, and at the slightest suspicion of a tick bite a 
doctor should be seen at once. 
[Kudinova]Nikolay Vladimirovich, you noted that urban 
residents suffer more from infectious diseases. There is no 
doubt that where population density is higher, the frequency of 
contacts is greater and it is much easier to get infected. But 
let's clarify this. The medical service has traditionally been 
more poorly organized in the countryside. Could it be that 
public health oversight is worse, and that this is what makes 
the statistics look better? 
[Shestopalov]Rural inhabitants are better protected 
against epidemics for objective reasons: After all, they are 
almost completely oblivious to phenomena such as refugees, 
vagrants and persons without permanent places of residence. All 
such people carry lice, with all of the ensuing consequences. 
And in contrast from the urban way of life, the traditions of 
the way of life and diet of the rural population have not 
changed. Such healthy conservatism keeps them safe. 
[Kudinova]Are you saying that the only way we can 
overcome the epidemic danger is to stabilize the situation in 
the country? 
[Shestopalov]Precisely so, you can never separate it 
from politics.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yu. Fedorov, chief specialist, Russian </F>
Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological 
Oversight, by Valeriya Leina; place and date of interview not 
given:`` Will We Overtake the War Year of 1918 in Cholera and 
Typhus?''] 
  [Text] During the turbulent days of devastating civil war, 
starving Russia was overwhelmed by raging epidemics of 
diphtheria, typhus and cholera. The famous ``Uncle 
Gilyay''--Gilyarovskiy, who was sent on assignment to the places 
of devastation, wrote that people were dying like flies from 
cholera. Today, things are bad in the country not only in regard 
to politics and the economy. The number of infectious diseases 
has risen. And among them, once again we have cholera, 
diphtheria and typhoid fever. 
[Leina]Are we threatened by mass epidemics? 
[Fedorov] We're not threatened by a repeat of 1918. 
But still, the situation is rather serious. We have registered 
62 infectious diseases. Among intestinal forms, cholera is the 
most frightening. This disease is distinguished by an explosive 
course: If it is not bridled in time, the danger of an epidemic 
is great. In the past, cholera was a classical disease, but 
later on, in view of causes unknown to us, the agent changed. 
Cholera under the name of El Tor (Ogava) penetrated into our 
country with shoppers from countries in which the standard of 
living and, consequently, public health norms are very low. For 
example five tourists from Orekhovo-Zuyevo who visited Turkey 
fell ill. A total of 21 patients and eight virus carriers were 
registered. Four of them were discovered in Moscow--a person 
without a permanent place of residence, a nurse, and two foreign 
subjects--from Syria and Lebanon. With the exception of one 
fatality in Dagestan, all of them lived through it and, for 
practical purposes, recovered. Despite the fact that it is 
difficult to monitor the disease because of the influx of 
refugees from southern republics (Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and 
Georgia), where the situation is many times more stressful, 
cholera has been fully contained in Russia. 
  The number of typhoid fever cases has risen. Last year there 
were 267 of them, while this year there were 621. As a rule, 
cases of infection are associated with contamination of drinking 
water. For example in the city of Volgodonsk, Rostov Oblast 
sewage made its way into old leaky water supply pipes, as a 
result of which 217 persons fell ill. 
  Dysentery and salmonellosis are a real calamity. Fifty-four 
outbreaks were registered in recent months, and 5,200 persons 
have succumbed. The diphtheria situation is unfavorable. The 
number of patients has neared 6,000. Pediculosis and scabies 
chiefly strike citizens without a permanent place of residence. 
Finally, typhus, anthrax, rabies and some other infections occur 
in very small quantities. 
[Leina]Are medicines available? 
[Fedorov]Yes, for example, cholera is stopped by 
timely administration of chemically pure salt solutions. Its 
treatment is rather inexpensive, while on the other hand 
preventive examination of people who come in contact with 
patients costs money. Immunizations are the sole means against 
infections spread by airborne droplets, particularly diphtheria. 
Despite the rumors the quality of our vaccine is very high, 
which is confirmed by experts of the World Health Organization. 
[Leina]What preventive measures and sanctions are the 
sanitary-epidemiological services employing? 
[Fedorov]Oversight of water supply and sewage 
facilities and vacation places has been intensified. Officials 
who violate public health norms are fined up to 3 months' wages. 
A fine of up to 100 minimum wages has been established for 
selling food products without a license. Unfortunately it is 
hard to control private trade--flea markets and second-hand 
markets. Poisoning by food products from state trade enterprises 
has grown in frequency as well. In these cases the 
sanitary-epidemiological service files a so-called regressive 
suit against the culprit, requiring him to compensate for the 
economic damages he inflicted.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kiselyov: ``New Cholera Strain </F>
Detected''; first paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment] 
  [Text] Cholera caused by a new pathogene has been brought 
into Russia. A particular insidiousness of the severe infection 
is that it cannot be diagnosed by the conventional methods. 
  Cholera is a truly terrifying disease because of the 
lightning speed with which it spreads. Fifteen to twenty five 
days elapse before the onset of typhoid fever. Cholera does not 
allow man to mobilize resources and nip the infection in the 
bud. All too often its incubation period lasts only a matter of 
hours. A day or a couple of days pass, and an infected person 
dies if he does not receive qualified aid. Neither do preventive 
inoculations help being next to useless and, so, they are rarely 
resorted to by medics. 
  Cholera continues its triumphal march across the planet and 
it takes root even in states it never visited before. Up to 
70,000 cases of cholera were registered worldwide in 1988-1990. 
In 1992-1993 they topped the million mark with thousands of 
fatalities. Russia is no exception in this regard. Last years 
six Russians were cured of cholera. This year there were 20 such 
``Russian'' cases and two foreigners, but one patient in Moscow 
succumbed to the disease. 
  ``It is a sheer miracle that the infection has not erupted 
anywhere yet,'' says the Rostov Regional Centre of the 
Sanitary-and-Epidemiological Inspectorate Deputy Chief Doctor 
Gennady Aidinov. Wars, refugees left to their devices, the 
``tentative'' Russian borders with a virtually total absence of 
sanitary control, an influx of illegal migrants from the Middle 
East and Asian countries, a multitude of lice-ridden homeless 
tramps and unemployable provide breeding grounds for almost any 
infection! Further, there is street trade, overflowing with 
filth and garbage and other waste, and dealing in worthless and 
substandard wares. And an appalling quality of drinking water... 
  It is perhaps the hand of God that an uncommon variety of 
cholera erupted precisely in Rostov. For a long time we heard 
virtually nothing about infection cases, infectious diseases 
were a closely-guarded state secret; even in service 
correspondence the plague was disguised as ``form 100'' whereas 
cholera was styled as ``form thirty.'' If the authorities were 
compelled to admit anything in this respect they did it through 
clenched teeth. 
  Rostov is traditionally a cholera-visited region. How should 
one behave in an emergency situation? Even an isolated case of 
this disease is an emergency. Moscow should be informed 
forthwith of every case and the WHO should be notified within 
twenty-four hours. The local epidemiologists know ``their'' 
disease not from books. There is a State Plague Research 
Institute in Rostov, the leading institution of this kind in 
the country, it is also concerned with cholera. Should a person 
succumb to cholera somewhere in a Russian hinterland, and not 
here, the local doctors might even fail to diagnose the case. It 
is fearsome to contemplate the consequences. 
  The uncommon cholera variety was ``delivered'' to Russia by 
plane. And in future it will also more likely than not find its 
way here by air. Remember how many international airports we had 
in Russia only a few years back. We had the airports of 
Sheremetyevo-2, Pulkovo and Khabarovsk, perhaps. Now there are 
no fewer than fifty and their number is growing. Our traders and 
merchants have been shuttling to and from places and locations 
where they can buy cheaper merchandise. That those places and 
locations are often infection-ridden is a matter of little 
significance to them. The sanitary services have been lagging 
behind Aeroflot flights catastrophically. 
  Regular flights to foreign countries from the Rostov airport 
were started six years ago, whereas a sanitation control centre 
is only being organized today. The chief of the local air fleet 
buckled under to the sanitary doctor (Lyudmila Prilutskaya 
heading the North Caucasus centre for sanitary-epidemiological 
inspection) and allocated the requisite funds. But before long 
the planes will start flying to foreign countries from eleven 
cities in this country, and then the charm exerted by 
Prilutskaya will be powerless. 
  ``True, sanitary control centres are being set up and 
financed in a rather haphazard way,'' they heaved a sigh in the 
State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Control. ``But 
we intend to set up 410 such outfits in our airports, on the 
seas, rivers and on railways, and we request 28 billion roubles 
for this.'' 
  That the amount will be received from the scanty state 
treasury is not an accepted fact yet. The program is to be 
implemented by the year 1997 but how can we explain to cholera 
that it should refrain from visiting us until then? 
  ``We shall not be able to prevent cholera visits by air of 
course,'' they nodded their understanding at the State Committee 
for Sanitary and Epidemiological Control. The main thing is to 
prevent the spread of the infection.''

<F P=106> [Article by Ye. Vladykin; ``Alarm! There's the Smell of </F>
Plague in the Air''; first paragraph is URALSKIY RABOCHIY 
introduction] 
  [Text]A dramatic rise in number of rodent-borne diseases 
has been noted in the oblast. 
  According to data of the Oblast Sanitary and Epidemiological 
Oversight Center, 148 cases of pseudotuberculosis (including 4 
outbreaks in children's preschool institutions) and 56 cases of 
intestinal yersiniosis in the first 6 months of this year. Let 
us note, for the sake of comparison, that 8 and 15 cases of 
these diseases, respectively, had been reported for the same 
period last year. Fresh vegetables that stored for some time at 
rat-infested warehouses of trade bases and stores are 
increasingly often the source of infection. 
  As we know, rodents are also involved in the spread of 
tick-borne encephalitis. Fortunately, there is still no 
tularemia, God forbid, or plague, yet these most dangerous 
diseases are also transmitted by rats and mice. 
  Wherein lies the cause of the unprecedented surge in 
morbidity? Specialists believe that it is not a matter of 
natural growth of the rodent population (in this sense, the 
situation is quite usual this year), it is simply that people 
have virtually stopped controlling this long-tailed filth. 
  Deratization, i.e., extermination of rodents, has been 
always 
the concern of disinfection and prevention stations and 
departments, which are paid for their work on a contractual 
basis. At present, many enterprises have more important things 
to think about than rats, and for this reason all the necessary 
conditions for reproduction and improved diet are provided for 
these animals. And the disinfection and prevention service is 
falling apart before our eyes, people are quitting because of 
the low wages, there are not enough modern poisons, 
transportation, needed materials and bait. 
  Payment for rodent extermination work from the local budget 
is the logical solution for this situation. After all, the 
Moscow city council adopted a decision that provides for 
comprehensive, regularly scheduled deratization (rats must be 
exterminated everywhere, in the residential sector, developed 
areas, and who is to pay the expense?). The authorities in the 
capital have allocated considerable budgetary funds, and have 
made it incumbent on all enterprises, regardless of forms of 
ownership, to conclude contracts with disinfection-prevention 
stations; they have implemented a number of measures to furnish 
this service with everything it needs, as well as for 
technical-engineering protection against rodents. 
  Moscow was the first to come to its senses. But the people 
of 
the Urals are maintaining an aloof calmness: they are not 
worried, so be it....

  [Text]Two cases of a new type of cholera, against which 
there are still no means of control, have been recorded in 
Russia. 
  As reported to us at the Sanitary and Epidemiological 
Station 
of the Russian Federation Ministry of Health, last week WHO 
reports were received about an outbreak of a new cholera-like 
disease in India. At the same time, two clinical patients 
appeared at a Rostov Hospital, whose symptoms resembled cholera, 
but the old testing methods did not confirm this diagnosis. As 
it was learned, the victims had returned several days earlier 
from a tour of India.... 
  The disease occurs in serious clinical forms. Thus far there 
are no means of controlling or detecting it. At present, the 
leading Russian scientists are working on the virus.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Tutorskaya, IZVESTIYA correspondent: </F>
``Ministry of Health Experts Report Hundreds of Thousands of 
Pediculosis Cases''] 
  [Text]Last year, there were 337,333 
officially recorded cases of human louse infestation, which is 
what we diffidently call pediculosis. 
  Specialists equate those who have lice with carriers of 
infection. 
  Because no one knows the moment and hour that, for example, 
an epidemic of dreaded, in the memory of the older generation, 
typhus will spread together with these lice. Typhus strikes the 
heart and central nervous system, and there were in the past 
quite a few cases of patient death. Experts of the Russian 
Ministry of Health emphasize in particular that it is very 
difficult to detect everyone with pediculosis. While 136,222 
people were recorded in the first 5 months of 1993 (which is 
slightly less than last year on a monthly basis), this is no 
reason to rejoice:in what places are adults and children the 
focus of attention in this respect? Obviously, in hospitals, 
children's institutions, hostels and summer camps. But many 
hospitals are shut down in the summer for repairs. Students have 
gone home. And the number of camps where children can improve 
their health is rapidly declining.... So that this figure of 
136,000 plus people could be considered the result of screening 
a sample. 
  Mikhail Narkevich, Russian Ministry of Health expert, 
believes that ``The cause does not lie only in dirt itself. In 
the course of civilian unrest, major migrations and roaming, not 
only the lifestyle but also the emotional status of people 
changes. Stress, apathy, nervousness and lack of self-confidence 
pave the way for infections in general. And for pediculosis too. 
The present ``surge'' started before the cost of soap and of 
washing at a bath house rose. And the insects have been found in 
many apartments with all the amenities, with rows of shampoos 
and hot water. Pharmacies are being supplied very poorly with 
louse-control agents.'' 
  There is another real threat that has arisen in the last few 
days, cholera in Tadjikistan. It arrived there from Pakistan, 
with tourists. With the present increase in migration and 
enormous flux of refugees, there is the possibility of cholera 
``arriving'' in Russian cities too. It is transmitted through 
dirty water, insufficiently pure food and dirty hands. 
  The saddest thing of all is that, in general, the means of 
salvation are simple. As for pedi..., that is to say, pardon me, 
lice, we postwar children were spared by kerosene. It is simple 
and effective.

Sakhalinsk: ``AIDS Has Traveled All the Way to Sakhalin''] 
  [Text]The first AIDS patient has been detected in South 
Sakhalinsk. He was a relatively young man who had never traveled 
abroad. 
  That is all that was reported about the patient at the 
Oblast 
Center for AIDS prevention and Control. The rest is a 
doctor-patient privilege. 
  The virus of the ``plague of the 20th century'' was detected 
when the patient visited the rayon polyclinic for a quite 
different and insignificant illness. At present, physicians are 
investigating this first patient's contacts. Incidentally, a 
correction must be made: first officially detected HIV carrier. 
In the opinion of specialists, there are up to 10 undetected 
cases for each one that is found.

Tomsk Oblast: ``AIDS Is Taking Over the Russian North''] 
  [Text]For a long time, Tomsk residents have been expecting 
this to happen sooner or later, some with panicked shudders, 
others with a feeling of irreversibility. And now the far from 
glad tidings have spread about an officially recorded HIV 
carrier in this oblast's cities and villages. 
  In commenting on this fact, A. S. Chernov, chief physician 
at 
the AIDS Prevention and Control Center, reported that Omsk is 
the only oblast in Siberia that is free of HIV infection, and it 
along with 25 other administrative territories of Russia (out of 
75) are models of fortitude. 
  In Tomsk oblast, the administration has approved on an 
emergency basis a comprehensive program for AIDS control 
covering a period up to 1995, and perhaps this is enough time 
for the the community of scientists and physicians to put an end 
to the calamity that has befallen us.

<F P=106> [Interview by Lidiya Lukyanova of Yevgeniy Nikolayevich </F>
Belyayev under the ``Ecology'' rubric: ``Public Health 
Physicians, Respond!''; first paragraph is large-type boldface 
KURANTY introduction] 
  [Text] When, especially in springtime, the stinking 
and unknown-to-the-civilized-world Soviet substitute for 
drinking water gushes through the water faucet, when some 
epidemic or accident in a toxic industry has rolled up to the 
threshold of your home, when there are more cockroaches in homes 
and rats in basements than there are tenants, when there is no 
longer anything to breathe in the city, then we will recall that 
besides the local administration, we have protectors against 
such similar disasters whom we taxpayers support, and we will 
send an SOS. 
  In the USSR, the Communist Party kept the sanitary 
inspectors' mouths shut tight with its' ``classified'' stamp and 
with its ``concerning nondivulgence'' signed statement, and it 
knew how to deal with insubordinates. Yevgeniy Nikolayevich 
Belyayev, who until recently was the chief sanitary inspector of 
one of Russia's oblasts, himself felt both the degradation and 
arbitrariness of such a service. For this reason, after becoming 
chairman of the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, Ye. Belyayev insisted, with 
government support, on the independence of his committee from 
the departmental service and, in some regions, from the local 
authorities. The masters of the sanitary service have always 
felt that it does not pay and were even sometimes afraid to give 
the public the truth about morbidity, the condition of the 
environment, and barbaric working conditions. 
[Lukyanova] I congratulate you on your independence 
for the first time in 70 years. But independence is tied to 
accountability. Yevgeniy Nikolayevich, have sanitary inspectors 
learned to use their independence to protect the public? 
[Belyayev] That is a difficult question. You will 
agree that not all of the service's directors and specialists 
have successfully managed to immediately restructure their 
psychology after crippling dependence on party discipline, after 
decades of the forced necessity of hiding the truth about the 
state of health and ecological problems from the public. 
However, we can now act on the basis of the law ``Regarding the 
Public's Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare'' and be guided by 
society's interests. I suggest that such independence should fix 
everything. It will be difficult, but we will learn to make 
decisions independently, and reform of the service is proceeding 
in this direction. 
[Lukyanova] Tell me, is sanitary inspection in the 
country now all-encompassing. Does it cover all industries or 
are their still exceptions? 
[Belyayev] Unfortunately, there are exceptions. The 
sadly familiar principle -- divide and conquer -- still applies 
to our service. It is very convenient for hiding negative 
information. The Russian Federation Ministry of Transportation 
has its own departmental public health service. Its status is 
such that it is not always able to halt public health 
violations. The Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, and Ministry of Security also have subdepartmental 
services. The main thing that alarms us is that our committee 
does not oversee the enterprises of the defense industry, the 
space complex, or the production of nuclear fuel. Departmental 
control of the former Third Main Administration of the USSR 
Ministry of Health has essentially been maintained, and the 
Federal administration of Biomedical and Emergency Problems is 
currently attached to the Russian Federation Ministry of Health. 
The departmental public health services do not have any legal 
basis for activity at closed enterprises. 
[Lukyanova] So do they have their own standards? 
Their own maximum permissible concentrations [MPC]? Their own 
levels? 
[Belyayev] Yes...Now there is the problem of 
destroying the very same chemical weaponry. Maximum permissible 
concentrations and maximum permissible levels must be 
established. The scientific research institutes working on this 
problem are under the management of the specified main 
administration. A situation has been created wherein the 
department itself will develop standards, and we will be forced 
to approve them. The last emergency in Tomsk is yet another 
example of closure. We have no oversight over this secret 
facility nor over analogous facilities. When an emergency 
arises, the committee is obliged to participate in clearing the 
consequences without knowing its specifics, process, etc. We 
have proposed subordinating the aforementioned departmental 
public health services to our committee but have encountered 
fierce resistance from the ministries. We do not intend to 
destroy them. They have knowledgeable specialists; too often, 
however, their departmental affiliation ties their hands and 
does not allow them to tell the whole truth. The government 
supports the associations of all departmental public health 
services in our committee, but the resistance... 
[Lukyanova] Forgive me. For months the government has 
permitted itself to ``support'' reorganization, but the 
authorities do not make use of it. If there are not enough 
authorities, it is possibly time to summon the people to the 
next referendum. Must we really wait for the next Chernobyl, 
Chelyabinsk, or Tomsk?.. Departmentalization closes the circle 
of problems of the Sanitary-Epidemiological Service's 
independence. Do not take offense, but will it really be more 
comfortable and easier for the specialists under the its wing? 
[Belyayev] You have touched upon the most difficult 
question in the development of our service. For years, quiet, 
submissive, obsequious directors have been selected and have 
learned to work in the bureaucratic style in order to, pardon 
the expression, survive and remain in their job. In the very 
same meat combine, there is the technology, the critics below, 
and the unsanitariness all around. And they ask the sanitary 
inspector, ``What, do you want the public to go without meat? 
Put yourself in our position. We must feed the people and not 
shut down production as you are prescribing.'' Builders 
delivering homes with unfinished work offer the same arguments. 
That is why some sanitary inspectors practically never make use 
of their right to shut down harmful or unsanitary production. It 
is very difficult for our services' directors to change their 
psychology. They do not want to fight, they do not want to...It 
is very difficult for sanitary inspectors to break the habit of 
``putting themselves into somebody's position.'' I have already 
said that not everyone has been able to change his ideology and 
get over the old system under the new conditions. But I also 
wanted to mention that we have many examples where service 
directors have made decisions based on principles. They have 
made full use of their right to halt violations of public health 
legislation. For examples, there are the Moscow, Perm, 
Sverdlovsk, Orenburg, and many other republic, kray, and oblast 
services. 
[Lukyanova] The press has reported information about 
the fact that foreign athletes and businesspersons, especially 
artists, have brought their own drinking water when visiting our 
country. Is this fact or fiction? 
[Belyayev] It is difficult to talk about this, but 
they do in fact bring in drinking water. It is a product used 
every day. Most of ours does not meet the international standard. 
  In Russia, 12.6 percent of the drinking water used 
absolutely 
does not meet even our state standards [GOST] with respect to 
bacteriologic indicators, and 23 percent does not meet the 
chemical indicators. There are territories in Russia where up to 
70 percent of the water drunk by the public does not meet the 
standard. It is not pleasant for us to speak about the cost of 
drinking water or about the fact that it is a product. The GOST 
``Drinking Water'' requires studies of water for 28 ingredients. 
The World Health Organization proposed that water be studied for 
50 ingredients back in 1984, and the list is now nearly up to 
100. So you judge our level. Our out-of-date water purification 
process makes it impossible to test for either 50 or 100 
ingredients. And out-of-dateness creates the appearance of 
well-being. Together with scientists, we are revising the GOST 
for water. I am afraid that 70 percent of our drinking water 
will turn out to be of poor quality. 
[Lukyanova] Is there any possibility of providing 
Russians with normal drinking water? 
[Belyayev] In the distant future. It will involve 
replacing the entire water treatment system and refraining from 
using chlorine. Civilized countries have long stopped using it. 
Chlorine compounds form corrosive and toxic substances in the 
body. Abroad, ozone purification of water is a stage that has 
already been passed, and we have not yet begun using the method 
in most cities. Other water purification and disinfection 
methods have already been discovered and are being used, and we 
must switch over to them. And the quickest way is that of 
building local units for additional water treatment, as is being 
done throughout the entire world. They may be designed for the 
home, hospital, children's settlement, or even apartment. The 
units are expensive but effective. A second way is to sell 
drinking water in containers as is done everywhere. And it must 
be decided quickly. The water supplied to the public in Moscow 
meets the GOST for drinking water. 
[Lukyanova]Your committee developed a document 
regarding compensation for harm inflicted to human health in 
connection with environmental pollution. What is the fate of 
this document? 
[Belyayev]It is now being examined in Russia's state 
legal administration. And I fear that the legal experts are 
trimming it it so that all that will remain is a shell with no 
teeth. In saying this, I am not implying any criticism of the 
legal experts. Very weighty arguments are necessary to prove the 
causes of such harm in court. This type of compensation is very 
unusual for our government. They have been ``tossing the 
document around'' for half a year already; however, we are 
standing up for the public's interests. 
[Lukyanova]I know that the committee has created a 
register of potentially hazardous chemical and biological 
materials. What is the purpose of this work? 
[Belyayev]Increasingly newer compositions, alloys, 
and chemicals are being used. Before they are used to 
manufacture, let us say, children's toys, we must know 
everything about these materials from the standpoint of 
adherence to public health standards and prevention of harmful 
health consequences. Construction materials that have not passed 
health tests and that have not been approved by the sanitary and 
epidemiological service have, for example, been used in 
finishing the interior of buildings. And it later became clear 
that they are harmful to health because they give off toxic 
materials. A register is needed to eliminate this type of 
ignorance. It is a check for the toxicity of materials used in 
the national economy and everyday life. 
[Lukyanova]While becoming familiar with your 
committee's work, I was surprised: You are continuing to 
actively set up antiplague institutions. I can't bear to find 
out that plague is again with us. But what about typhus and 
cholera? 
[Belyayev]Plague has not been recorded among Russia's 
population for many years. Natural foci of the infection have 
recently been activated, however. That is, there has been an 
increase in the number of cases of rodents and fleas excreting 
plague microbe. Each year, the institutions of the antiplague 
system exterminate rodents in order to reduce their number. The 
members of the public who live within the territories of natural 
foci, as well as geologists and shepards, are being inoculated. 
Antiplague institutions are maintaining constant oversight of 
this menacing infection and developing new diagnostic 
preparations. Specialists at antiplague institutions are now 
taking preventive measures against especially dangerous 
infections. 
  As far as cholera is concerned, only isolated cases of its 
being brought in from India and other countries have been 
recorded in Russia in the past 3 years. Poor-quality sewage 
treatment and contamination of water reservoirs by sewage are 
creating a real threat of cholera in several places, however. 
The deterioration of the socio-economic situation in the 
country, increase in detergent and disinfectant prices, and lack 
of baths have all led to a significant increase in scabies and 
pediculosis. The high louse infestation of the population 
constitutes a potential threat of the occurrence of nearly 
forgotten typhus. 
[Lukyanova]Fresh vegetables have appeared, and with 
them a panic over nitrates. What should we do -- eat them or 
just feast our eyes on them? 
[Belyayev]There are no vegetables without nitrates. 
Nitrates are a natural phenomenon in vegetables, and the only 
threat lies in their level of accumulation. Even if vegetables 
are not fertilized at all, they will still have a natural 
nitrate content. The danger lies using chemical fertilizers with 
no control of time or amount. In such a case, the amount of 
nitrates in vegetables may reach a toxic level, and when they 
accumulate in the body, they prevent the circulation of blood, 
bind hemoglobin, and facilitate the formation of carcinogens. 
  Standards for safe nitrate contents in different fruits and 
vegetables based on safety criteria have been established. In a 
vegetable predominating in the diet of the population of a given 
local, the nitrate standard should be as low as possible. Local 
public health services have the right to make nitrate content 
standards more stringent. I will note our country has the 
greatest number of nitrate content standards for fruit and 
vegetable products. Other countries do not view them as strictly. 
  The nitrate level in lettuce and beets, for example, is low 
in our country. Farmers and truck farmers are obligated to 
adhere strictly to norms and times between the fertilization and 
harvesting of vegetables, espeically in the case of ammonium 
nitrate. Otherwise, the plants do not have time to process the 
nitrates into other compounds that are harmful to humans. Thanks 
to inspection by Moscow sanitary inspectors, the amount of 
nitrates in vegetables grown around Moscow have decreased by a 
factor of 1.5 to 3.

<F P=106> [Article by Galina Kolesova; first paragraph is large-type </F>
boldface SMENA introduction] 
  [Text] Seventy-five Russian territories are already 
lodging serious complaints to the government in connection with 
the collapse of a most important social service -- the Russian 
Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological 
Oversight [Gossanepidnadzor] system. 
  As of today, the Russian government's debt to all federal 
services amounts to 40 billion rubles, 16 of which is to the 
Gossanepidnadzor. A selective conference of representatives of 
the public health services of 75 regions throughout Russia 
convened yesterday morning to discuss one matter: development of 
a set of demands to the government. 
  These demands, the ``13 Points,'' were developed and 
approved 
by the participants at the Petersburg Conference of Workers at 
Gossanepidnadzor Institutions back on 28 July. But because our 
city health service is in the same situation as all other such 
services in Russia, the essence of the regions' demands has not 
changed. The main demands are as follows: Provide the total 
financing for the sector's institutions that was allocated from 
the federal budget, including wages to its workers, and classify 
medical education and scientific institutions as socially 
significant services... 
  And only one item caused disagreement: the need to 
temporarily shift the service to financing from the local 
budget. There have already been similar precedents in Russia. 
And what initially seemed like a rescue turned out to be fraught 
with new problems because, as is a well-known fact, he who pays 
calls the shots. In Yakutiya, for example, the local authorities 
financing this service sharply cut the size of the service 
itself. In other regions, authorities actively opposed the 
closure of ``ecologically dirty'' enterprises... 
  In any case, there are grave doubts on the matter in 
Petersburg and no hurry to ``go begging to Sobchak.'' It is 
precisely for this reason that the collective of the city 
agreement committee especially insisted on government guarantees 
regarding repayment times in the event that short-term 
interest-free loans from ``local funds'' are granted to the 
service. 
  And our city service is trying to resolve yet another 
important matter. It is trying to obtain permission to use 50 
percent of all fine sanctions at its own discretion. The Malyy 
soviet already denied this request in the spring. The agreement 
committee members were convinced that the the amount -- 50 
percent -- frightened the deputies, whereas they believe that 
the city cannot receive even this sum because there is nothing 
more frightening than a ``corrupt sanitary inspector.'' And, as 
they emphasize, it is only one step from poverty to corruption. 
  The chairman from Krasnodar, speaking at the selective 
conference, said ``A blow to the public health service is a last 
blow to the people.'' Perhaps it was right after this phrase 
that premier Chernomyrdin yesterday morning gave Finance 
Ministry Director Fedorov permission to grant emergency 
appropriations to repay the service's debt. Fedorov, they say, 
handed the directive down -- to the local authorities.

increasing in Ulan Ude. As compared with last year, the number 
of those ill with syphilis increased ten-fold, and with 
gonorrhea, by twenty per cent. 
  According to the data of the dermatovenerologic dispensary, 
the majority of the patients are nonworking individuals and 
students up to thirty years of age. With regard to the primary 
sources of infection, these were, in the opinion of physicians, 
emigrants from China and the Transcaucasian republics who enter 
Russia without the appropriate medical records. 
  Director of the City Health Department, Margarita Khaltaeva, 
sees the legalization of prostitution, the opening up of 
anonymous treatment of venereal diseases, and the creation of a 
morals police as a possible avenue to the correction of the 
situation. She spoke at a meeting of the Minor Council of 
PeopleUs Deputies of Ulan Ude regarding the idea of opening a

Virus With Yellow Eyes: You Haven't Heard of This Disease, But 
by the Way, More Than 10 Million Russians Are Infected With It] 
  [Text] Two types of hepatitis, B and C, bearing frankly 
mortal danger for man, having been growing here into an enormous 
problem: according to the calculations of specialists, more than 
10 million Russians are infected with hepatitis C, and it can be 
supposed - in fact no one knows this precisely - many more are 
infected with hepatitis B. It is the agent of this disease in 
particular that is more widespread than of all the other 
hepatitis, and it is, into the bargain, more dangerous: it is 
following hepatitis B in particular that cancer frequently 
develops, to an even greater degree than from hepatitis C. If 
one looks at the problem from opposite perspective, it turns out 
that the virus of hepatitis C is found in ninety per cent of 
patients with cirrhosis and cancer of the liver. 
  The situation is complicated by the fact that the majority 
of 
oncological patients are also treated, among other methods, by 
means of the scalpel and are transfused with donated blood, and 
that no one can state with certainty that ill-fated hepatitis is 
not introduced into these patients with this blood, because here 
we do not carry out such investigations. If that is the case, 
and most likely it is the case, then frequently operated 
oncological patients die not of the cancer, but of subsequent 
complications like acute hepatic insufficiency. 
  But, after all, that's how matters turn... It's not 
accidental, however, that hepatitis C in particular is more and 
more often called the plague of the twentieth century. Not AIDS, 
but this cursed hepatitis of ours. 
  The Americans were the first to become alarmed and to take 
up 
the struggle against hepatitis C in a concerted manner. They 
developed and began to produce diagnostic preparations to 
identify cases of hepatitis C; it was they who carried out the 
first mass surveys. The result proved staggering: 85 per cent of 
patients with chronic hepatitis had acquired the ubiquitous 
virus following blood transfusion. 
  The problem in our country has become especially acute. 
About 
22 million doses of blood were given in the last year of the 
existence of the USSR. That means that there should have been an 
equal number of analyses. Even if it is assumed that one 
analysis costs a dollar, while in fact is it is more expensive, 
it is not difficult to imagine how much such analyses for the 
hepatitis C content would cost. Understandably, we did not do 
such analyses, and indeed, they are not done now. I donUt know, 
perhaps they are in special, exceptional cases. But it is 
necessary to do them! If for no other reason than otherwise the 
consequences will be unpredictable. 
  People who, by the very character of their work, know the 
nature of the hepatitis virus transmitted with blood, are 
ringing the alarm, attempting to attract attention to the mortal 
danger lurking in the shadows of many other problems. Oncologist 
Professor G. A. Tkacheva, analyzing the pathways along which the 
hepatitis C virus reaches the organs of healthy people, 
concludes: about 60 million people pass through Russia's medical 
hospitals a year. People who is operated on and transfused with 
blood are treated conservatively. But they must all be 
administered drugs intravenously. And that is the path of 
infection. 
  All else aside, the trouble lies in the fact that even the 
acute forms of hepatitis very often progress with weakly 
manifested symptoms, and therefore many cases remain totally 
unrecognized. Someone is sick, and gravely sick, and no one 
knows why. 
  This alarming situation is aggravated also by the fact that 
this virus is transmitted not only through every possible 
medical manipulation, but by sexual intimacy as well, like the 
AIDS virus, and even through the most ordinary social contacts 
between people. So you see the kind of disaster... 
  So, is there no rescue? Specialists believe that a national 
program of unreserved examination of donor blood and of all 
blood going into the preparation of every possible type of 
pharmaceutical, of all patients subjected to contact with needle 
and scalpel, of all pregnant women and all children -is the only 
way the chameleon virus can be conquered. 
  It stands to reason, the creation of the domestic 
manufacture 
of diagnostic preparations must be provided for in this program. 
Otherwise, after all, we are preferring to pay insane amounts of 
money to foreign firms for ready-made preparations, and are 
therefore condemned to buy them into the future, instead of 
organizing our own production. 
  My old, good friend, Corresponding Member of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, Professor M. S. Balayan, who has been 
dealing with the hepatitis all his life, and has carried out an 
extremely dangerous experiment on himself, nevertheless confided 
to me with a smile: Perhaps we shouldn't panic. Although, of 
course, all that is so, all that is correct - the danger is 
great. Just consider the fact that in the last ten years about 
fifteen previously unknown infections have come to light. It is 
normal that they come to light. What is abnormal is that we 
begin to combat them late. 
  Yes, in fact he and I recall together: an unknown bacterial 
disease had suddenly broken out, striking down the majority of 
the participants of a Congress of Legionnaires who had gathered 
not so long ago in the US. Thus it was called Legionnaires 
disease. Vilyuisk encephalomyelitis, unknown to science, a 
terrible, slow infection, inexorably destroying the brain, was 
discovered in this country. They learned to treat Legionnaires 
disease; the Vilyuisk disease has remained a riddle. But it has 
not attempted to extend its boundaries. Hepatitis, on the other 
hand, runs about, raging wildly throughout the entire 
unprotected land. 
  That, you see, is the kind of danger it is.

<F P=106> [Interview of Academician Nikolay Trapeznikov by Tatyana </F>
Sadkovskaya, under the title: RThere Are Practically No Healthy 
People in Russia] 
  [Text] The occasion for the discussion with the 
Academician, Director of the Oncological Center, and student 
(since school days) of the patriarch of domestic oncology, 
Nikolay Blokhin, was in no way a scientific sensation. But the 
fact is not routine, even in relation to the present times: the 
Oncological Center is closing for one and a half months, from 
July 15 through September 1. Is there is no money to support the 
work of this enormous, unique complex, to treat patients? Such 
information has already appeared briefly in the press. 
  The Center is actually a bit low on resources. But about 
this 
- a bit further on. The Academician explained this uncommon fact 
by the long-developing necessity for the repair of some of the 
buildings of the complex, which opened as long ago as 1980. 
Patients whose treatment cannot be interrupted will continue to 
receive it; the fate of the others has also been looked after. 
In a word, the Academician expressed confidence that there will 
not be patients who have suffered as the result of this action. 
It is difficult to check this assertion; therefore, let us take 
the eminent Academician at his word. 
  And although there has been no sensation, you will 
understand 
that it made sense to continue the conversation... 
  It is said that AIDS is the plague of the twentieth century. 
In Russia 500 people have acquired this plague. But in 1990, 700 
thousand people in the USSR fell ill with cancer. We now have 
500 thousand new cancer patients annually in Russia alone. Five 
hundred and 500 thousand. But the majority, to please various 
currents of opinion, are more concerned with the problem of AIDS. 
  Today 42-43 per cent of our patients recover. This is the 
per 
cent of recovery of the colored population of the US. It is 
higher among the white population - half of the oncological 
patients. It is clear why: the conditions exist for early 
diagnosis, there is a higher level of medical assistance 
rendered. So that deliverance from the terrible disease is not 
only a scientific, medical problem, but a social problem as well. 
  How does it occur, and what are the causes... 
  According to forecasts, at the beginning of the next century 
every third person will become ill with cancer in the course of 
his life. Our current social characteristics will have their 
effect in 10-15 years. It is known that incorrect nutrition is 
the cause in 35 per cent of cases of the occurrence of malignant 
tumors, and smoking in 30 per cent. Fifteen after the second 
world war, the number of cases of cancer of the stomach 
increased sharply - the deprivations of the war years were 
taking their toll. Now these tumors, as in other countries, are 
encountered infrequently. Among tumors, lung cancer leads among 
men, breast cancer among women. But in 15 years a sharp increase 
in stomach cancer cases awaits us: todayUs deprivations of the 
population will take their toll. When I lecture in the labor 
collectives, it is awkward for me to speak of rational nutrition 
- people in general are going half-starved. 
  I especially want to talk about smoking. The widespread 
publicity about the nation's ill health elicits, to put it 
mildly, surprise. A number of bans and restrictions of local, 
including Moscow, authorities is not changing the situation 
fundamentally. It is necessary, as has occurred in the US and 
Canada, and for which the French public is campaigning, to ban 
legally the advertising of tobacco products. Note: our 
politicians give interviews, as a rule, with a cigarette in 
their teeth (in his time a chain smoker, as are, incidentally, 
many surgeons, Nikolay Nikolaevich gave this habit up twenty 
years ago. - T. S.). Or, for example, athletic competitions are 
going on, and the entire stadium is plastered with cigarette 
ads. How can this be reconciled? Moreover, smoking fosters the 
occurrence not only of cancer of the lung, but of the throat, 
the urinary bladder, the kidney... Americans are a nation more 
interested in and knowledgeable about questions of health; 
therefore, in the US in the last 2 years 3 million people have 
quit smoking... 
  Yes, 30 per cent is an impressive fact. Could you 
comment on another percentage that has been mentioned: 42-43 per 
cent of people with a diagnosis, which until now has sounded 
like a simple death sentence, do recover... This percentage 
evidently includes cases caught at an early stage. 
  The WHO has proclaimed: early diagnosis saves the patient's 
life. This is correct. But now, thanks to advances in 
chemotherapy we cure even some neglected forms of cancer. We 
cure cancer of the testis in 85-90 per cent of cases, including 
those with lung metastases. We even eliminate some tumors of the 
uterus without operative intervention. At our center 100 sick 
young children are observed, born of women who have experienced 
uterine cancer. Osteogenic sarcoma is conquerable in 70-75 per 
cent. Medicine will very shortly be in a position to cure some 
malignant tumors completely. Even now 80-85 per cent of children 
with cancer can be rid of the disease. All we need is a full 
arsenal of preparations, radiation therapy, and highly qualified 
specialists.S 
  I believe that you have only the latter at your 
disposal. 
  We have the equipment for radiation therapy: 60 per cent of 
patients receive it - in pure form and in combination. Linear 
accelerators are already in use throughout the world. Here they 
can be counted on oneUs fingers: the Center, oncological clinics 
in Volgograd and Arkhangelsk. There are another ten RelephantsS, 
domestic counterparts of American accelerators, with much poorer 
capacities. Therefore, gamma therapy is mainly used in the 
outlying regions. But that is a past era. 
  But the greatest problem is antitumor preparations. We are 
always short of them. One foreign firm has opened a currency 
pharmacy at the center. Some kind of safety valve, at least. 
  I passed by it. The prices are scary: there are 
ampoules for 40 dollars each. How much does the treatment of one 
patient cost? I hope, anyway, it's not up to him personally: 
shouldn't oncological patients be helped gratis? 
  We charge patients from the CIS. We do not take money from 
Russians. How much does it cost? One simple example: the modern 
treatment of a patient with osteogenic sarcoma with preservation 
of the extremity (previously an amputation was carried out). The 
cost of an endoprosthesis is 5 thousand dollars. Plus 
chemotherapy - this is another 25 million rubles. If an 
enterprise can pay for the treatment, we accept it. We pay for 
others out of the budget, our commercial activity. But here is a 
paradox which cannot be explained. We treat from budgetary 
funds. And there is, for example, the state firm, TFarmatsiyaU. 
It is ready to send us currency preparations, but it requires 20 
per cent of the ruble cover of the cost of these pharmaceuticals 
from the Center. This is very much like shuffling the same money 
around different pockets of the same pair of pants. 
  Given such a patient cost, how much money does the 
state allocate to the Oncological Center? 
  It's easier for me to answer what the budget of our partner, 
the American National Cancer Institute, is. One billion 200 
million dollars. While so far this year we are living without a 
budget at all. The Russian Academy of Medical Sciences promises: 
we will give so much for treatment, so much for food, for 
salaries. And not a word about scientific research, although we 
are a scientific institution first and foremost. True, I have 
received pleasant news from the Ministry of Health: the Center 
is being allocated 2 billion 125 million for the development of 
expensive treatment methods such as bone marrow transplantation, 
plastic surgery in oncology... 
  Our last conversation compelled the optimistic 
percentages of recoveries to fade. Therefore, let us return to 
the stage of neoplastic diseases when the shortage of funds will 
not be so tragic for the outcome of the illness, that is, the 
problem of early diagnosis. 
  The Center has now concluded an agreement with enterprises 
and organizations to carry out surveys in collectives. We are 
creating teams of various specialists and equipping them with 
the most up-to-date equipment. Literally the other day twenty of 
our colleagues returned from Novorossiysk. A terrible picture is 
sketched on the basis of the results of these trips. I have in 
mind not only our patients, but the state of health overall. And 
a large number of cases of cancer, about which people were 
completely in the dark, have been identified as a result of each 
trip. 
  Landings of specialists are not comparable, of course, 
with a stagnant must-do situation, with a professional 
examination which cannot be called anything other than a bluff. 
Certainly, those who are completely in the dark are on the 
conscience of its initiators... But one center like yours is not 
enough for all of Russia. And not every enterprise in todayUs 
conditions can allow itself, obviously, a not inexpensive 
contract with the Center. 
  In our time we have been leaders in oncological science. 
But, 
now... There are national anti-cancer programs in many developed 
countries. They are reviewed by parliaments, and obtain the 
necessary financing. The President of the US has a council on 
oncology; it was headed up until his death by Hammer, who is 
well known in our country. Congress hears the Director of the 
National Cancer Institute annually, and only then approves the 
budget. 
  Russia also needs such a government approach to the problem, 
which is longer called an exclusively medical problem (remember: 
every third person contracts cancer in his lifetime), and our 
own national program, directed toward a reduction of mortality 
from tumors. 
  Our Center is engaged in its development. Perhaps the fate 
of 
draft law on oncology we developed, which has been lost in the 
long drawers of our parliament, will not befall this document. 
Primary prevention, early diagnosis (screening programs, for 
example, to identify cancer of the uterine cervix and breast 
here have already been worked out here to the level of 
demonstration projects), fundamental research, the development 
of treatment methods - these are the main necessary constituents 
of such a national program. I am naming them in order of 
priority. 
  Well, in the practice of domestic oncology today the 
priorities have been precisely arrayed more or less the wrong 
way around.

RHow to Filter Out Our Unpalatable StuffS] 
  [Text] The article RA Dangerous Russian Product -Water 
(Izvestiya, No. 136, 1993) has generated a real explosion of all 
sorts of information concerning water, its capacities, treatment 
technologies, and water purification devices. 
  It turns out that, in addition to household installations, 
collective purification installations are being set up for 
hospitals, cafes, or organizations wishing to provide their 
staff with good water. The Polimersintez Scientific Production 
Association [NPO], in particular, is manufacturing such devices. 
The developers have given one of their products as a gift to 
Vladimir Lying-in Hospital No. 2. By the way, the Rucheek-1S and 
the Rucheek-2S household water purifiers, which we had mentioned 
in a previous publication, already have certificates of 
compliance, so that now only the price can be a cause for 
reflection for a purchaser. 
`` Most of the inhabitants of our planet are aware of the 
necessity of purifying water'', says Corresponding Member of the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Yu. Rakhmanin, Chief of the 
Laboratory of Drinking Water Supply of the Sysyn Scientific 
Research Institute of Ecology and Environmental Hygiene. 
  Yuriy Antonevich, chief of the water country, as his 
instrument developers jokingly call him, as he is the chief 
expert of the WHO on water supply questions, knows everything 
there is to know about water purifiers, all the more so since 
domestic water purifiers undergo testing in his laboratory. He 
divides these devices into two generations. 
  Devices based on the principle of filtration or absorption 
purification belong to the first. These instruments have one 
essential deficiency: they only partially reduce the bacterial 
and chemical contamination of the water. The best-known 
representative of filters of this type is the Rodnichok. They 
also include the TRosaU of both modifications, the TMechtaU, and 
the TKolokolchikU. 
  A whole collection of water purifying devices has been 
gathered in Professor Rakhmanin's laboratory, from individual 
devices, in the form of a small tube, through which one can 
drink water from any source on a hike, to stationary devices, 
installed in kindergartens, hospitals, and cafes. The individual 
filters have proven to be better than foreign ones in 
effectiveness, although more poorly designed: the service life 
is three times longer, and in addition they kill viruses. The 
individual filter, RodnikS, of the All-Union Scientific Research 
Institute of Medical Polymers [VNIIMEDPOLIMER] was in its time 
even awarded a prize of the Council of Ministers of the former 
Soviet Union. All of these are water purifiers of the second 
generation, in which complete decontamination of the water of 
both viruses and bacteria and agents of the parasitic diseases 
is ensured through iodine-containing reagents. 
  But there are no analogs of this device in the world, says 
the professor, pointing to a light plastic cylinder with an 
intake tube attached to the valve, and an output tube delivering 
prepared water. 
  The device is called the Izumrud. And it purifies water on 
the basis of an entirely different principle, through 
electrolysis. In it water passes through three stages of 
purification. First it is subjected to anodic oxidation; 
micro-organisms and organic and other contaminants are 
decomposed in the process. Then compounds of active chloride are 
destroyed, and finally neutralization of heavy metal ions takes 
place in the anodic chamber; these become nontoxic, harmless for 
man. Electrochemical activation does not simply purify water, it 
makes it, in the words of the development engineers of the 
Russian-American Emerald company, active; this is living water, 
close in quality to spring water or to the melt water of 
glaciers. And such water is especially useful.

AIDS Virus''] 
  [Text] As of today, the 697 persons infected with the AIDS 
virus in Russia reside in 53 territories of the Russian 
Federation. Of these, 280 are children. The number of 
AIDS-infected adults who have died has reached 98 persons, 61 of 
them children. Medical workers are attributing this increase in 
the number of infected children to the fact that between 1987 
and 1993, 17 children were born to mothers infected with the HIV 
virus. The number of AIDS patients at the stage where the virus 
carrier is already recorded as being sick is increasing slowly 
yet steadily. As of today, 127 adults and 90 children are 
affected, while 79 adults and 52 children have already died. 
During the past year, 497 foreign citizens infected with AIDS 
have been identified in the Russian Federation. All of them have 
been deported.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Yablokov, A. Demin, Russian Federation </F>
Interdepartmental Commission on Environmental Safety, ``And Our 
Health Will be Even Worse''] 
  [Text] The unforgiving statistics are showing that the 
public health of Russia's citizens is critical and is continuing 
to deteriorate. Likewise, the demographic situation in Russia is 
becoming increasingly acute. The most recent statistical data 
attest to an ``avalanche'' of deaths and ``burnout'' (they are 
even using this term) of entire population groups, primarily 
able-bodied men. 
  According to data from the State Statistical Committee, 
mortality indices are continuing to grow: in 1987, the total 
mortality rate was 10.5 per 1,000 of the population, and in 1992 
and 1993, it rose to 12.2 and 14.6, respectively. Furthermore, 
the total number of deaths during the last year exceeded the 
total number of births by more than 50%. According to 
expert 
predictions, by early 1994 a stable natural population decrease 
will be observed in 88 Russian territories which are home to 
93% of the total population. For comparison, in 1992, the 
same 
situation existed in 45 territories and in 1987--in only three! 
  A further decrease in life expectancy is being predicted. 
These indicators have been steadily deteriorating since 
1986-1987. The anticipated life expectancy among women is 11.8 
years longer than that of men--73.8 vs. 62 years. State 
Statistical Committee analyses demonstrate that if today's 
mortality age level remains unchanged in Russia, 40% of 
boys 
born in 1993 will not reach their sixtieth birthday. 
  What is hiding behind these frightful figures? The mean life 
expectancy is one of the most objective indicators for 
determining the quality of life and environmental conditions. 
According to World Health Organization data, 50-60% of 
human 
health depends on the socioeconomic factors, such as nutrition, 
smoking, personal safety, etc., 20-30% depends on the 
environmental conditions, 10%--on hereditary factors, and 
only 
7-8%--on medical care proper. Thus, the state of public 
health 
in Russia which has been at the center of experts' attention for 
over 10 years is affected by both the sociopolitical crisis, 
political instability, and environmental conditions in the 
country. And as a result, the increasing mortality trend due to 
chronic and infectious diseases is growing. The aging of 
Russia's population which is characteristic of all countries 
also affects the increase in the total mortality indicators: in 
1994, the number of retirement-age persons will be more than 
20% of the total number of people in Russia. 
  While we are citing the totals for the country as a whole, 
the situation is very different in various territories. For 
example, in the Tuva republic, the mortality level among 
able-bodied population is higher by 1.5 times than the average 
for Russia. In Pskov, Novgorod, Leningrad, Tver, Kemerovo, and 
Irkutsk oblasts, this indicator is 20-25% higher than the 
average. 
  According to recent predictions, the birth rate is expected 
to stabilize somewhat throughout the country, primarily due to 
an increase in the number of women of child-bearing age. In all, 
the demographic situation in Russia is the future of the nation, 
and it will in large measure depend on whether the family will 
manage to survive these difficult times and whether we are able 
to maintain our traditional universal values. 
  If we objectively sum up the above tragic statistics, the 
conclusion will be unambiguous: Russia is sick, and the state of 
its public health is already threatening national security. So, 
reliable information about this--the truth about all of us--must 
become public knowledge. Only then will we be able to make an 
analysis and take realistic steps which would give hope of 
improving the situation.

  [Text] One of the methods of improving the well-being of 
Moscow's 120 self-financed hospitals is affiliation with 
commercial structures. Compared to medical service fees abroad 
(75,000 dollars or higher), 500,000 rubles for two weeks in a 
boarding house, an examination by one of the medical 
luminaries--ophthalmologist Academician Arkadiy Nesterov--and 
treatment or bloodless liver operation using Western practices 
is a negligible amount. Yet it is still out of reach for 
80% of 
Russian citizens. 
  To improve free service to indigent patients in the 
hospital's self-financing wards, Clinical Hospital No. 15 in 
Vykhino found a reliable source of ``off-budget'' financing--the 
``Avicenna'' Russian-Syrian joint venture (SP). In 1988, the 
hospital became its principal stockholder after acquiring 
69% 
of the shares. Here, top-notch service and treatment are offered 
to the well-off, while the resulting resources ``work'' for the 
entire hospital complex. 
  The positive impact from such interaction is indisputable. 
Deputy Director of Moscow's Chief Medical Administration 
Aleksandr Lukashev commented thus on the outlook for cooperation 
with commercial structures: 
  ``No obvious disaster with medical service can be foreseen 
at 
the capital's hospitals since budget allocations with a 2.5-fold 
``padding'' for inflation on a quarter-to-quarter basis amounted 
to 65 billion rubles during the summer (it was 15 billion at the 
start of the year--A.D.). Yet despite future centralized 
shipments of powerful antibiotics, anti-cancer preparations, and 
equipment to the clinics under direct contracts with various 
companies, there is still a shortage of anesthetic drugs and 
ultrasonic and endoscopic equipment. Consequently, we are 
supporting any form of property in public health--sole 
proprietorship or joint-stock companies--which provide medical 
assistance at a proper level and advance Moscow's health 
services.''

<F P=106> [Article by editorial board, ``Radiation Around Us''] </F>
  [Text] This was reported by Nina Solovyeva, an expert from 
the Novosibirsk Cytology and Genetics Institute, in the course 
of a ``round table'' at the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources. According to 
Miss Solovyeva, an examination of residents from the village of 
Muchlyumovo located on the river Techa, 78 km downstream from 
the radioactive waste discharge from the Mayak Scientific 
Production Association, revealed elements in the chromosomes of 
certain children which belong neither to the father nor to the 
mother. In the physicians' opinion, this is a result of mutation 
changes in the organism. Furthermore, the residents of 
Muchlyumovo display impairments in their organism which are 
typical only of this inhabited locality. Thus, e.g., the 
ailments not detected in other regions include constant 
dizziness, numbness in the body and limbs, nose and gum 
bleeding, and gastrointestinal tract disorders. In attempts to 
treat the residents of Muchlyumovo, children in particular 
respond inadequately to drugs. Moreover, 33 cases of balding 
have been recorded among children in recent years, some of them 
involving total baldness, according to the Postfaktum Agency.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Ivanov, ``Flu Passed Us By''] </F>
  [Text] During the past week, only one case of flu was 
confirmed in Moscow whereby several such cases were recorded in 
the preceding week according to a report to the Interfaks Agency 
by Moscow's chief infectious disease specialist Nikolay 
Malyshev. According to Malyshev, altogether the level of flu 
morbidity does not exceed the usual level. The number of cases 
is decreasing rather than increasing. In N. Malyshev's 
prediction, one can hardly expect a serious flu outbreak in the 
near future. As preventive measures, he recommends that the 
capital's residents use conditioning, fresh air, plenty of 
liquids, lemons, honey, and one drug--dibazol. 
  At the same time, ``diphtheria is giving him a much bigger 
headache'' in the words of Moscow's chief infectious disease 
specialist. N. Malyshev reported that between the start of the 
year and 25 November, 2,001 diphtheria patients were recorded in 
Moscow, including 458 children. During the same period, 86 
persons died from diphtheria. 
  In November alone, 316 new patients were recorded, 188 of 
them children. The number of diphtheria patients compared to the 
same period of the last year increased by threefold. Mortality 
due to this disease is increasing even faster. N. Malyshev 
emphasizes that ``the sole preventive measures is vaccination.'' 
  According to the Russian Federation State Committee on 
Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight, the level of intestinal 
diseases in Russia has risen again since June 1993 following 
several rather successful years. In 1992, e.g., the lowest 
incidence of dysentery was recorded during the entire official 
recording period for this disease (since 1970). 
  Yet the number of dysentery patients during the first eight 
months of this year rose in the Russian Federation compared to 
the same period of the last year by 21.2%. The greatest 
increase was observed in the northern and northwestern regions. 
Altogether, reports of 30 outbreaks have been received during 
eight months by Russia's State Committee on Sanitary and 
Epidemiological Oversight. 
  Cases of cholera have also been recorded. In July-August, 
this diagnosis was confirmed in 11 Russian citizens who returned 
from India, Pakistan, and Turkey. Two patients were identified 
in Dagestan and Stavropol kray.

<F P=106> [Article by G. Serdykovskaya, N. Kuindzhi, ``We Are Behaving </F>
Like Comprachicos''] 
  [Text]One of us has already written in Retsept how for many 
decades we have built--and are continuing to build!--school 
buildings which do not meet hygienic standards and how the 
health of many generations is affected by it. Our Institute of 
Child and Adolescent Hygiene (the only such science 
establishment not only in Russia but in the entire CIS) is 
engaged in research in many directions, studying the health of 
children and adolescents in all its diversity. Some of such 
studies are unique. 
  In examining one of the biological criteria of women's 
health, we examined the case histories of the school period of 
today's first-time mothers [primapara]. They were interviewed in 
one of Moscow's maternity wards. Data from the questionnaires 
administered to each woman were complemented with information 
about the course of her pregnancy and the gynecological 
diagnosis of labor activity. The resulting studies made it 
possible to establish the relationship between the course of 
pregnancy and birth and the characteristics of their lifestyle 
as children and adolescents. 
  Thus, the first year of menstrual age in 78% was 
accompanied 
by various specific manifestations of yet-unformed menstrual 
cycle whereby 43% of the respondents indicated a general 
deterioration of health or academic activity during menstrual 
periods. Approximately 20% of the women identified the 
menarche 
year as the most difficult year of learning at school. Among 
these data, the following highlights are the most interesting. 
  Only about 20% of today's first-time mothers had 
normal 
course of pregnancy and physiological delivery. The lowest 
percentage of unfavorable social and biological factors during 
the school years was identified in this group of respondents: 
excessive intellectual or athletic stress, chronic pathologies, 
and complications during the child-bearing age. 
  The most numerous (approximately 40%) was the 
contingent of 
women whose pregnancy and delivery pathology was due to the 
presence of extragenital processes in the organism as a result 
of an explicit or, evidently, latent chronic pathology. Allowing 
for the time factor, we have established that chronic pathology 
formed in more than 30% of first-time mothers in their 
childhood and adolescence. Among those under considerable 
intellectual stress (students at specialized schools of varying 
intellectual orientation as well as those combining education in 
a conventional school with training in a music or art school), 
the frequency of pregnancy complication by anemia increased by 
threefold and by hypotonia--by tenfold; labor activity anomalies 
were noted 1.5 times more frequently and surgical intervention 
during labor compared to the frequency of these indicators among 
the entire contingent of respondents was more frequent by 
threefold. 
  The total number of pathological manifestations during 
pregnancy and labor in each of the women who, during childhood 
years, combined chronic pathology with considerable intellectual 
stress was especially significant. In this contingent of 
first-time mothers, the proportion of various complications in 
the infant status increased by almost twofold: fetal hypoxia, 
hypertrophy, and asphyxia. 
  At the same time, moderate athletic activity which was 
evaluated in women who since childhood participated in 
extracurricular activities with physical stress in public 
schools, clubs, palaces of culture, etc., ensured the lowest 
incidence of pathological manifestations with respect to the 
course of pregnancy and labor and did not lead to complications 
in the state of the infant. In this first-time mothers' 
contingent, all indices characterizing the progress of pregnancy 
and labor were most favorable. 
  We would like to report one more extremely important fact 
recorded by anthropological researchers from our institute. Some 
time ago, the public was well informed about the spread of 
acceleration among the young generation. But no one has written 
anything about the phenomenon of retardation. Yet it does take 
place. Especially among our girls. In recent decades, they have 
become not only shorter in height but also lighter in weight and 
began menstruating later which, in women, is the principal 
indicator of biological maturity. 
  We promised to present the conclusions at the end of this 
publication--they are alarming if not tragic. The regimen of 
academic life has a negative impact on the health of our 
children, especially girls. And if in the case with school 
building construction much can be attributed to our constant 
poverty, how can one explain the unjustified and hygienically 
unsound prevailing conditions? This does not require any capital 
outlays but rather an investment of heart, mind, and after 
all--concern. Are we also short on that too? 
  We picked up the pen with the intention of focusing 
attention 
once more on the fact that the five-day week cannot and should 
not be a universal feature.

<F P=106> [Interview with Irina Ivanovna Piskarevaya, head of </F>
department for organizing oversight of the public's food 
products, by V. Semenenko under the ``Visiting Card'' rubric: 
``Are They Storing Bananas in Morgues?''; first paragraph is 
boldface MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA introduction] 
  [Text] The long-awaited market has finally arrived, 
bringing abundance with it. At any hour of the day or even night 
one can acquire the most necessary products by using the 
services of stores operating around the clock and various 
delicacies since there are plenty of merchant's booths in 
Moscow. The prices, of course, do not gladden the popular 
consumer. But that is the subject for another conversation. 
Today's subject is the quality of the products we buy. And we 
are speaking with I. Piskarevaya, head of the department for 
organizing oversight of the public's food products of the Moscow 
Center for Sanitary-Epidemiological Monitoring. 
[Semenenko]Irina Ivanovna, please briefly outline the 
scope of your service's concerns. 
[Piskarevaya]We monitor the quality of the food 
products sold at Moscow's food industry enterprises, track 
merchant organizations' adherence to public health standards and 
rules and the quality of their products, and conduct analogous 
monitoring of public kitchen enterprises. 
  There are other problems of concern to us related to correct 
organization of feeding individual categories of the population 
organized into collectives such as students and workers in 
different occupations. In addition, matters of dietary and 
therapeutic nutrition as well as prevention of food poisoning 
and intestinal illnesses also fall within in our jurisdiction. 
[Semenenko]Considering the uncivilized nature of our 
market, let's begin with a topic that is of interest to every 
Moscow resident. Please tell us about the measures your service 
and the city authorities are taking to protect us against food 
poisoning. 
[Piskarevaya]Beginning this year, we have begun 
working in earnest on the problems of hygiene certification of 
products, guaranteeing both their safety and quality. To do this 
we take random samples of batches of incoming goods and perform 
laboratory tests on them. We issue a certificate on the basis of 
the test results. But two other commercial organizations created 
under the State Committee for Standards [Gosstandart] 
(Rost-Test-Moskva [Growth-Test-Moscow] and Soyeks) also issue 
so-called certificates that generally only certify the quality 
of products provided by foreign seller-firms. 
  Although, we have not, thank God, had any outbreaks of mass 
food poisonings, there are reasons to worry in connection with 
the absence of proper monitoring of the quality of incoming 
products. There are cases where we reject products that have 
certificates of compliance. The question of a single procedure 
for certifying products is now before the Moscow government, and 
we hope that it will be decided in favor of the consumer. 
[Semenenko]Such matters must of course be decided at 
the government level; however, the good Russian proverb ``Hope 
in God, but don't take a false step'' involuntarily comes to 
mind. So how about this? Is it possible to guard against 
unpleasant consequences by buying expensive imported goods in 
colorful packaging? 
[Semenenko]Quality is, alas, determined only by 
taste. And it is absolutely necessary to see the date of 
manufacture. Meat products, confections, canned goods, and 
packages in which juices, water, and beer are sold are generally 
marked with an expiration date. Sometimes they also have a date 
of manufacture so that one can get a rough idea of at least a 
product's degree of freshness. 
[Semenenko]Of course. But what do you advise in 
relation to alcoholic beverages? How safe is it to buy them in 
the nongovernment commercial network? Indeed, as is well known, 
they are a most popular product. 
[Piskarevaya]We recently raided merchant enterprises 
under all forms of ownership and in all administrative districts 
of the capital to take samples of wine and vodka products not 
manufactured in Moscow. The laboratory studies showed that 40 
percent of them do not meet State Standard [GOST] requirements. 
[Semenenko]What kinds of preventive punishment does 
your service use upon discovering a low-quality product, a 
product being sold after its expiration date, a storage 
condition violation, or a failure of merchant enterprises to 
adhere to public health rules? 
[Piskarevaya]We stop the sale of low-quality 
products, close the enterprises, and impose fines on managers 
and other accountable individuals who violate trade standards. 
In August alone, we issued 40 decrees halting the operation of 
small retail and commercial food facilities and more than 90 
decrees imposing fines totaling about 3.5 million rubles. 
[Semenenko]There is a certain clarity regarding 
preventing food poisonings. Now let us turn to intestinal 
infections, another extremely timely topic, especially in 
connection with the spread of cholera in Central Asia, from 
where we traditionally get outstanding fruits and vegetables. We 
know of cases of this disease in Moscow as well. 
[Piskarevaya]Our service monitors all the capital's 
markets. As far as the spontaneously developing trade in produce 
on the city's squares and streets is concerned, it is banned by 
decree of Moscow's Chief State Sanitary Inspector for the sake 
of citizens' safety. 
[Semenenko]But they still are still selling... 
[Piskarevaya]They are only selling because people are 
buying. And no city police forces would be sufficient to 
constantly drive these uncontrolled markets away. As soon as 
they arrive, the merchants scatter. After they [the police] 
leave, it is if they sprout up from under the ground. 
[Semenenko]Well, what is the answer? 
[Piskarevaya]There is only one answer: Take 
responsibility for one's own health. Do not risk buying products 
from the hands of a seller who does not have the appropriate 
medical documents granting him the right to sell. In addition, 
there is another danger lurking here. No one knows how these 
fruits and vegetables were grown, how much chemical fertilizer 
was put on them, and finally under what conditions they were 
stored and transported. 
[Semenenko]The problem of storage is also of great 
interest to our readers because it is directly linked to the 
quality and safety of food products. We know that previously all 
fruits and vegetables went to fruit-and-vegetable bases. But 
now? Not long ago I read a newspaper report about how it is 
known for a fact that bananas are being stored in morgues 
allegedly right alongside corpses. Please comment on this 
information. 
[Piskarevaya]The fruit-and-vegetable bases have been 
retained. Both government and private sector suppliers are now 
using them. Part of their produce proceeds via direct channels 
into the commercial network. As far as the monstrous details 
regarding bananas are concerned, we do not have any such 
information, although a check of the promulgated facts was 
conducted. I am inclined to think that it is all the fruit of 
someone's wild imagination if only because heat-loving bananas 
do not need below-zero storage temperatures. 
[Semenenko]Thank you. I think you have calmed many 
lovers of the exotic fruit. And now I will turn to yet another 
matter that is also directly linked to quality control of food 
products. What efforts are being made there? 
[Piskarevaya]There are 125 sanitary inspectors and 
about 200 of their assistants working in city and district 
epidemiology centers plus the directors of these departments. 
[Semenenko]Irina Ivanovna, you are fighting a losing 
battle. A little over 300 workers for our enormous city? But 
certainly it must be understood that most of them are women who 
are naturally simply afraid to cross the threshold of a merchant 
or storage organization, especially as uninvited guests? 
[Piskarevaya]This is a very serious problem that must 
be solved. The number of personnel must be increased in view of 
the development of the commercial network, and perhaps other 
forms of operation should be examined. Perhaps a public health 
police force should be created. 
[Semenenko]Thank you for talking to me. It is the 
tradition of this newspaper to publish phone numbers to call to 
receive additional information. 
[Piskarevaya]Our telephone number, 287-31-41, 
operates around the clock.

  [Text] The other day, the city veterinary service seized a 
batch of Belgian pork sausage meat. As its employees reported to 
MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, more than 60 tonnes of sausage meat 
intended for sale to Moscow residents was found infected with 
life-threatening salmonellosis. The meat, which was purchased 
abroad for a very low price, was shipped to the capital by a 
commercial firm. The vacuum-packaged sausage meat could have 
been sold through commercial booths as well as through stores by 
direct contract. 
  In specialists' words, the lion's share of imported food 
products being sold in the capital by direct shipment is 
hazardous to Moscow residents' health. Veterinarians are most 
afraid of meat products from Spain because the plague is now 
raging in that country.

<F P=106> [Article by N. Nadezhdin: ``Criminal Business''] </F>
  [Text] It is a well-known fact that the road to Hell is 
paved with good intentions. Alas, this simple truth is often 
forgotten -- especially when misfortune enters our life and we 
are sparing no resources trying to help ourselves or our loved 
ones. And hospital physicians are often forced to ask a 
patient's relatives to give blood. The shortage of blood and 
blood substitutes has immediately spawned a criminal business. 
Street dealers very boldly selling both albumin and plasma have 
appeared in Moscow in great numbers. Beware of buying similar 
preparations from so-called ``unestablished individuals.'' 
Laboratory studies of the blood substitutes demonstrate that 
they have been isolated from the blood of animals, and 
transfusion of these substitutes into a human may cause death. 
  If necessary, use the following opportunity. Come to the 
Blood Transfusion Center and donate your own blood. In exchange, 
you will receive the very same quantity of the necessary blood 
group.

<F P=106> [Andrey Bayduzhiy interview with Yevgeniy Belyayev, chairman </F>
of the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight and Chief Sanitary Inspector 
of Russia, and Vladimir Cheburayev, head of the sanitary 
monitoring department of the Russian Federation State Committee 
for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight: ``Is Russia Becoming a 
Hotbed of Diseases?''] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Sore Spot 
[Bayduzhiy]In the opinion of the director of the 
sanitary-epidemiological service, is the sanitary-epidemic 
situation in Russia getting worse or better? 
[Belyayev]Unfortunately, it is getting worse. This </H3>

year there was an avalanche of morbidity due to diphtheria. In 9 
months, 7,628 cases of diphtheria were recorded and 300 persons 
died. Morbidity due to pertussis, measles, and other infections 
that may be controlled by vaccine prophylaxis also increased. 
  There are several reasons for this crisis. People's immune 
defense of their bodies has weakened because of a deterioration 
of food quality. Energy hunger is now being observed among 20 
percent of the population. And constant stress situations 
because of uncertainty regarding tomorrow are affecting the 
human immune system. In addition, in the past 2 years, the 
public's faith in vaccines has been undermined as a result of an 
antivaccine campaign in certain parts of the mass media. We were 
only able to correct the situation at the end of this past year 
by initiating propaganda for wide-scale vaccination of the 
population. But time had already been lost. 
  Yet another reason for the increase in morbidity due to 
diphtheria and diseases in its group is hidden in the fact that 
physicians have begun to fear giving vaccinations because of 
possible complications and contraindications. Instead of 
preparing a contingent for vaccination, they simply reduce their 
number. We have not raised the question of mass vaccination very 
strictly. And Russia is no exception here. In the United States, 
the most democratic country with private health care, a child 
with no vaccination record is not even allowed near a school. 
Even our emigrants there write letters to the committee 
requesting that their vaccination records be sent. 
[Bayduzhiy]And when, in your opinion, will it be 
possible to change this situation? 
[Belyayev]A headquarters for the fight against 
diphtheria has now been created. The government has passed a 
special decree for it and has begun allocating money. We had 
planned to vaccinate the entire population by the beginning of 
1994. Because of insufficient production of the vaccine, 
however, this will evidently only be possible by the end of the 
year. By that time, morbidity due to diphtheria should fall. The 
same applies to other diseases in its group. 
[Bayduzhiy]With diphtheria things are more or less 
clear. But the worsening of the sanitary-epidemiological 
situation in the country is hardly tied to an outbreak of 
morbidity due to it alone... 
[Belyayev]The rapid spread of three other groups of 
infections is worrying us greatly. First, there are intestinal 
diseases, among which dysentery and cholera stand out. Here the 
situation is exacerbated by large migration flows, and this 
summer was a difficult one for our service. Eighteen cases where 
cholera was carried into Russia from distant countries were 
recorded. It was only thanks to emergency efforts that the 
situation was kept under control. A program to protect Russia's 
boundaries and territories from dangerous human, animal, and 
plant diseases being carried in from abroad has now been 
developed. It will be presented to the government this month. 
  Recently, however, natural foci of the following infections 
have been revived in Russia herself: malaria, fever, and plague. 
Ten natural foci of plague alone have been counted on her 
territory. Among them, the Astrakhan and Kalmykia foci have 
recently become highly active. Plague causative agent is 
beginning to circulate actively among the animals there. 
People's access to these rayons has been sharply restricted; 
however, a falloff in discipline could lead to very negative 
consequences. 
  And finally, there is yet another group of infections with 
increasing morbidity -- venereal diseases. This year, 30,000 
cases of early syphilis have been recorded. The level has never 
been this high since the war. This is especially alarming 
against the background of the growing threat of AIDS. Despite 
the fact that 688 HIV-infected individuals have been registered 
in Russia, we have still been able to hold back the onslaught of 
AIDS. It is important to do so as long as possible until an 
antitoxin to this infection is found. 
[Bayduzhiy]Do they understand how serious the 
sanitary-epidemiological situation is in the government? 
[Belyayev]If they did not, Russia would already have 
millions of patients suffering from infectious diseases. The 
situation in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, where a catastrophic 
increase in morbidity has occurred, would have been repeated. 
Everyone, including the president, is working with us. A concept 
and federal program for development of sanitary-epidemiological 
monitoring has been developed. The service has the status of an 
independent service, and by law, no one has the right to 
intervene in our activity. 
[Bayduzhiy]And what attempts have there been? 
[Belyayev]As soon as the service began to acquire 
authority and influence that was unanticipated by many, 
individuals appeared who desired to take it into their hands. 
This included both local authorities and the Ministry of health, 
who wanted to subordinate it to itself. The problem of 
counteracting mafia structures, which given our poverty, are 
trying to influence the service's specialists through bribes, is 
becoming increasing acute. Incidentally, financing is perhaps 
the most painful issue for us. Since September we have been in 
no way able to increase our workers' wages by a factor of 1.8 -- 
a measure stipulated by presidential edict. Unlike physicians at 
medical institutions, who receive their salaries from the local 
budget, workers of the independent sanitary-epidemiological 
monitoring service are unable to do so. As a result, a stream of 
specialists are leaving the service. This is forcing us to seek 
the possibility of including nonbugdet funds by introducing a 
charge for our services. Such practical measures evoke 
criticism, but we cannot survive otherwise. 
[Bayduzhiy]A couple of years ago any conversation 
about sanitary-epidemiological problems inevitably came around 
to the total absence of any laws in this area. Today there are 
laws. But do they work? 
[Cheburayev]The first law, titled ``Regarding 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Well-Being,'' was issued in 1991. It 
declared principles that at the time were absolutely new for the 
USSR and Russia: people's right to a clean environment and 
participation in its protection, the obligation of government 
bodies to inform the public of the ecological situation, and the 
need to compensate for damage to health. In reality, however, 
the mechanisms of realizing these policies did not exist, and 
some of them, for example, the opportunity for the public to 
participate in developing an environmental protection policy or 
the right to financial compensation for damage inflicted to 
health, only existed on paper. Problems of a methodological 
nature became the great obstacle here. How, for example, would 
it be possible to isolate the role of any one enterprise in 
harming a person's health as a result of emissions from other 
factors such as the person's own harmful habits, his heredity, 
and his unhealthy way of life? Perhaps we have only succeeded in 
realizing the principle of openness of information most 
completely. All of the data that the service has regarding the 
sanitary-epidemiological situation is accessible and published 
regularly. 
[Bayduzhiy]Does the service have enough economic 
levers to act upon the sanitary-epidemiological situation? 
[Belyayev]We can fine a violator three months' wages. 
And we recently received the right to fine enterprises. Much 
remains to be regulated, however. Today, for example, it is very 
difficult to halt construction that is violating public health 
standards. Before, everything was simple -- an instruction was 
given to the bank, which was a government structure, and it 
halted financing of the construction. Now with the commercial 
banks, nothing can be done. Or take another example. The legal 
board has taken a document regarding compensating citizens for 
damage inflicted on their health that we agreed upon with 
interested departments and has been tossing it around under 
various pretexts for half a year already. Obviously, as soon as 
it is approved, there will be a squall of requests from the 
public, and they are afraid of this. I think, however, that we 
will nevertheless push through a similar policy, especially 
since it is fixed in the draft of the new constitution. 
[Bayduzhiy]In essence, such a measure would mean a 
revolution in the government's relationship to the public's 
health. 
[Belyayev]Yes, but it is not coming to us easily. 
Some day, when I am retired, I will write my memoirs about how 
all of this happened. 
[Bayduzhiy]But here again comes the question of 
whether it will be possible to transform what is written on 
paper into real life. As far as I know, the prepared draft of 
the law titled ``Regarding Providing the Public With Drinking 
Water'' contains a provision something like the following: Water 
line owners must compensate the public for damage to their 
health resulting from consumption of poor-quality water. In some 
specialists' opinion, in practice, even in the first year after 
it takes effect, the law will result in the ruin of most water 
supply services. Can such a policy be implemented? 
[Cheburayev]Even if it cannot, it is no reason for 
changing the law. The main thing is to formulate the task and 
begin performing it. In this case, the threat of fines and 
actions will compel water suppliers to make the expenditures to 
modernize their equipment. This will inevitably make water more 
expensive, and so be it. Today in our country, 25 to 27 percent 
of drinking water goes for industrial purposes, and in some 
cities the figure is as high as 50-60 percent. Naturally, in the 
event of such a policy, there will not be enough purification 
facilities or reagents. The pattern of squandering nature must 
be changed. 
[Bayduzhiy]The leadership of the Russian Federation 
State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, together 
with other representatives of the Russian Council of Public 
Health Physicians, became engaged in the preelection conflict as 
a part of the ``Kedr'' [cedar] block. What dictated this step? 
[Cheburayev]Years of work in the 
sanitary-epidemiological monitoring system have shown that it is 
impossible to improve the situation regarding protecting the 
environment and human health at the level of competence 
possessed by the previous legislature. There is no system to the 
legislation that has been passed. Thus, individual laws 
regarding policy in the area of handling radioactive wastes and 
nuclear power generation have been developed in the absence of 
general legislation about radiation safety. That is putting the 
cart before the horse. Completely unacceptable policies are 
being put into other laws at the very moment of their 
development. In the Principles of the Law Regarding Labor 
Safety, for example, compensation and benefits for harmful labor 
conditions are stipulated. The measure appears to be 
progressive, but in reality, it stimulates work in dangerous 
industries and, in essence, selling one's health. And in our 
country today such workplaces number 12 million. The law should 
have stipulated another solution to this problem that is termed 
``protection by time.'' Essentially, this means that if it is 
hazardous to work under certain conditions for an entire work 
day, the work day should be reduced to the safe limit, whether 
6.3 hours or even 30 minutes, and the person should receive a 
full day's wages. Benefits and compensation may only remain in 
situations involving no damage to health during work but rather 
the risk accompanying work as, for example, in the case of 
pilots or miners. 
  Without the development of competent legislation and entry 
into parliament, it will not be possible to change the attitude 
toward protecting the environment and human health. The election 
of ``Kedr'' to parliament was necessary because unlike many 
other ``green'' parties and movements, it does not talk but 
really acts. In today's situation, this is very important. 
<H5>  ITAR-Tass Postscript </H5>
  The plan of the State Special Program for Ensuring the 
Russians' Sanitary-Epidemiological Well-Being in 1994-1996, 
which was prepared by the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight and presented to the Russian 
Federation government for consideration, has been tabled for a 
month for revision. The principal comments made at the 
government's meeting on 2 December concerned reducing proposed 
expenditures for sanitary and epidemiological measures and 
tightening the public health service's control over enterprises' 
and organizations' ecologically harzardous activities. Instead 
of having the state committee plan expenditures for equipment to 
neutralize toxic wastes, the Soviet recommended that factors 
without such neutralizers be shut down. It has been proposed 
that the total expenditure estimate, which initially amounted to 
70 billion rubles, be sharply cut.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Scabies Epidemic in City''] </F>
  [Text] The number of scabies patients in Moscow has nearly 
doubled compared with last year. As we reported at the city's 
Main Medical Administration, the reason for this increase is the 
increased number of refugees that have carried the disease in 
and the dirtiness of Moscow residents themselves. There have 
been cases where entire families have contracted scabies. 
Families often try to rid themselves of the infection by using 
mercury salve, which is unsuitable for treatment. Immediately 
thereafter they arrive at the hospital with acute poisoning. 
Sometimes self-treatment is fatal. The other day, young parents 
with a nursing child that could not be saved were brought in a 
critical condition to the Center for Treatment of Acute 
Poisonings of the Scientific Research Institute imeni 
Sklifosovskiy.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Serezhina: ``Fight Cholera and...Mushrooms''] </F>
  [Text] As specialists have confirmed, the cholera outbreak 
in russia is not unexpected. A sharp increase in this disease 
throughout the world has recently been noted. International 
statistics give the following figures: 118,000 persons in just 
the first half of this year. Naturally, this disease has been 
brought to us primarily from the countries of the Hindustan 
Peninsula. But cholera has not just been ``imported'' into our 
country. For many years, epidemiologists have found the cholera 
causative agent, vibrio Eltor Ogawa, on Russian territory in 
objects in the environment -- generally in open water 
reservoirs. Only adherence to sanitary and hygiene rules can 
protect us from this terrifying disease: Do not drink untreated 
water (Moscow residents may because their tap water conforms to 
public health standards), and wash your hands carefully with 
soap before eating... 
  It is not just cholera, however, that currently presents a 
serious threat to health. The overall epidemiological situation 
is bad. 
  This was the subject of a recent press conference organized 
by the Russian Federation State Committee for 
Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. 
  Each year, up to 1 million cases of acute intestinal 
infections are recorded in the country. The cause is 
poor-quality products and water. Specialists have serious 
concerns about the increase in mushroom poisonings. Death-cup 
amanitas are the most frequent but not the only cause. 
Physicians believe that paxils are poisonous and unsuitable for 
use.

<F P=106> [Article by Lev Markovich Portnoy, Doctor of Medical </F>
Sciences, Professor, Head of the Roentgenological Department of 
the M. F. Vladimirsky Moscow Oblast Clinical Scientific Research 
Institute; under the title: The Second Coming of Tuberculous] 
  [Text] A relatively quiet tuberculosis situation with 
periodic outbursts of this disease, which were being 
successfully handled by the previously created powerful 
anti-tuberculosis service, with its fine staffs and network of 
regional, city, and oblast (kray) anti-tuberculosis 
dispensaries, characterizes recent years. And we had become 
accustomed to this situation. 
  But today, suddenly, but perhaps not so unexpectedly, taking 
the difficult situation in the country into account, the 
tuberculosis situation has become acute. Not for nothing; after 
all it is, as we have emphasized, a social disease. And even the 
mass media, with the whipping up that is characteristic of them, 
exaggerate the danger of the new incursion of tuberculosis, the 
possibility of its causing trouble in the very new future cannot 
in any way be excluded. There are, to a certain degree, 
additional preconditions for it in the person of a clearly 
weakening state medicine. 
  Without in any way disputing the situation in the country 
that predisposes to tuberculosis, I believe that the simple 
repetition of measures, proven in the past, directed to the 
campaign against this malady, must not be permitted. Times today 
are different, medicine has different possibilities, and the 
general situational background is not what it was after the war. 
  By the way, observing the away in which our organizational 
structures are beginning to act, it is difficult to get away 
from the impression of a patent duplication of the methods of 
fighting against tuberculosis that were used in the remote 
postwar years. To substantiate what I am saying, I would like to 
cite the fluorography situation in our public health system as 
an example. 
  Certainly, no one will dispute the fact that in the campaign 
against the tuberculosis epidemic in the war-turn country, 
fluorography did in fact have great significance. A fairly good 
material and technological base for those years was created. The 
service worked in close contact with the phthisiatric 
(anti-tuberculosis) service. In essence, the former was 
organizationally subordinate to the latter. It can be stated 
that in those years fluorography was one of the principal actors 
among the RparticipantsS in the successful attack on 
tuberculosis. 
  Years past; tuberculosis took up its usual place in the 
overall structure of morbidity. But, the powerful 
anti-tuberculosis and fluorographic services continued to 
operate, without changing their habits, under conditions of 
Ractive combat situation. 
  And meanwhile, the overall medical situation changed, 
including the tuberculosis situation. And tuberculosis itself 
learned how to oppose the forces acting on it more stubbornly, 
and its geography changed sharply. But the main thing was that 
scientific and technical progress provided medicine with many 
new technologies, making it possible to look differently on the 
possibilities of diagnosis overall, and the diagnosis of 
pulmonary tuberculosis in particular. 
  Entirely new views appeared on the problem of the 
fundamental 
improvement of the campaign against the so-called mass diseases, 
by means of the formation of risk groups, first of all, and by 
the development of the corresponding diagnostic models for their 
early identification, in the second place. Finally, the same 
scientific and technical progress forced a change in the 
attitude toward the problems of radiation burdens in the case of 
the so-called prophylactic examinations by means of radiographic 
diagnosis, and, of fluorography, in the first place. It is 
entirely natural that against this background as a whole, the 
anti-tuberculosis medical organizational structures of today 
require obligatory correction. And this relates above all to the 
fluorographic service. 
  Formed nearly half a century ago, it has remained today in 
essence in the same organizational-methodological positions of 
half a century back. The first of these is the constant striving 
to cover the entire healthy population by mass prophylactic 
fluorographic examinations. Orders and various normative 
documents, new rules of the Ministry of Health regarding the 
conduct of such examinations are constantly coming out. But they 
all in essence fail to take into account the true state of 
affairs, and have been produced clearly simply to take away the 
acuteness of the problem and to preserve the old organizational 
forms of the entire anti-tuberculosis organizational complex. 
  Fluorographic technology, at the same time, which now 
literally saturates the polyclinic network, also requires its 
own improvement. The method of examination in which the 
physician of the fluorographic office in essence knows nothing 
about the patient, since communication with him is precluded, 
today clearly does not respond to the new criteria. Nothing, 
practically, has been decided about the questions of the 
completing of the examination, if the physician considers it 
necessary to carry out a number of supplementary procedures. Of 
course, in the post-war years such an organizational plan 
corresponded to the Rspirit of the times; today it is simply 
morally obsolete. In this way a lousy situation has been 
created; subsequently it has been expanding in the form of 
today's system of mass prophylactic examinations of the 
populations. 
  Specialists in radiation safety see in this one of the 
causes 
of the general increase in radiation exposure of the healthy 
population. Oncologists, believing that such a system of 
examination is one of the factors influencing the increase in 
the frequency of oncological diseases, join them in this 
opinion. But, the antituberculosis service which, as we have 
stated, is very powerful, remains as unshakable as a rock, 
arguing the necessity of such examinations. Of course, we can 
understand it, since it is very difficult to part with a 
habitual stance, which such indices as mass scope, convenient 
for reporting, underlie. And this means, large figures, millions 
of patients - consequently, a high volume of work accomplished... 
  Today, I dare say, the structure of the fluorographic 
service 
does not meet the requirements for screening, mass diagnostic 
examinations. Under no circumstances should, I believe, 
fluorography be made a principal participant of the planned 
antituberculosis campaign. Otherwise we risk loosing it. Why? 
First, the existing system for carrying out mass prophylactic 
examinations is impracticable. Second, even after it is 
corrected, it will be effective only if all of the structures of 
the anti-tuberculosis service are changed concurrently. If we 
take into account that some of the serious sources of 
tuberculosis are places of incarceration. If we take into 
account pharmaceutical shortages. If we don't forget about the 
appearance of a new class in this country, persons of no fixed 
address [bomzhi]. And about many other factors. It is these in 
particular which make the activation of tuberculosis possible. 
  To make todays mass fluorographic examinations with coverage 
the main prop in the campaign against tuberculosis means, in our 
opinion, throwing wide the gates of our life to tuberculosis. 
  Well, then what shall we do with fluorography? Completely 
excluded from the campaign methods? Not at all. Just the 
opposite. We must make use of the quite abundant polyclinic 
network of fluorographic machines and the organizational 
structure of this service. But, to eliminate as much as possible 
all of todays RnegativesS relating to fluorography, its 
efficiency must be increased. And this means that it is 
literally necessary to combine fluorography as a part of 
roentgenology with it in all respects. And not so 
formalistically as today. Freeing the office physicians from 
worrying about RcoverageS is the job of the directors of the 
organizational-methodological divisions of the dispensaries. In 
the process, the mere description of those disastrous one-plate 
fluorograms of the lungs must not fall within the duties of the 
fluorographic office physicians. Today they cannot remain simply 
picture-takers. We should think seriously about increasing the 
size of the fluorographic frame to 100 mm. Our experience tells 
us that the resolving capacity of fluorography in general is 
sharply increased in the process. 
  And if one is to think seriously about a new approach, then 
it is also necessary to switch over in practical public health 
to digital fluorography. The leading firms that are 
manufacturing apparatuses for radiological diagnosis are now 
moving precisely in that direction. In that case, incidentally, 
the accusations of the threat of radiation burdens on the 
patient will no longer be valid. 
  But this is for the future; at the moment, first and 
foremost, it is necessary to shift to differentiated 
fluorographic diagnostic examinations of tuberculosis risk 
groups; the contemporary approach to their formation should be 
taken as their basis. This is also important in connection with 
calls for the prohibition of fluorography altogether because of 
radiation burdens on the population. 
  Our proposals are not the fruit of theoretical reflections, 
but the product of many years of experience of the M. F. 
Vladimirsky Moscow Oblast Clinical Scientific Research Institute 
[MONIKI] in carrying out the differentiated comprehensive 
fluorographic diagnostic examination of risk groups for a number 
of the principal pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis. Our 
data attest to the effectiveness of this approach, such as, for 
example, in differentiated fluorography among detected cases of 
pulmonary tuberculosis (and there are no small number of them), 
the majority of the patients had undergone preliminary 
fluorographic examination through the existing system and the 
so-called prophylactic fluorography, under which tuberculosis 
had not been detected. 
  All the considerations presented in this article flow from 
many years of experience of exclusively professional dealings 
with patients ill with various lung diseases, including 
tuberculosis. Perhaps our public health organizers will also 
discover what is useful in them. Although I can very well 
imagine that the reaction to todayUs printed word will be very 
insubstantial.

Roentgenological Department of the M. F. Vladimirsky Moscow

<F P=106> [Article: ``Cholera Bacillus Detected in Yerevan: Cholera </F>
Already Rampant in Other CIS States''] 
  [Text] Ararat Mkrtchyan, Armenia's chief state public 
health physician and the republic's deputy minister of health, 
held a press conference on 6 August. 
  He reported to journalists that the indicators for the 
dysentery epidemic that began 2 months ago in Goris have 
declined significantly. In this time 500 cases of this disease 
were registered. In 6 months of this year 150 brucellosis cases 
were registered. Last year 700 cases were registered. Ten days 
ago cholera bacillus was discovered in Shaumyanovskiy Canal, 
Erebuninskiy Rayon, Yerevan. 
  Last week the republic's epidemiological commission held a 
meeting in the Ministry of Health. During it a decision was made 
to stop the cholera epidemic--to create special subdivisions in 
customs offices for public health inspection. Attention must be 
turned primarily to large transportation junctions, the airport 
and the railroad station. There are plans for carrying out 
preventive measures, and for taking samples to study the 
condition of water basins. Swimming in open-air water basins was 
prohibited. 
  Ararat Mkrtchyan reported that cases of cholera have not yet 
been registered in Armenia, but such cases do exist in states 
neighboring on Armenia--Turkey and Iraq. Special attention is to 
be turned to tourist ties with countries neighboring on Armenia. 
  The situation is more reassuring in Georgia, where the 
overall level of infectious diseases does not elicit any 
apprehensions. 
  The health ministries of the two countries--Armenia and 
Georgia--agreed on joint public health inspection. 
  Ararat Mkrtchyan announced that cases of cholera were 
recently registered in the territory of the former Union. On 3 
August seven cases of cholera were registered in Tajikistan, and 
on 4 August 15 were registered in Azerbaijan and seven in 
Dagestan, one of them a fatality. Three cases of cholera were 
registered in Krasnodar, and two cases in Rostov. Cases of 
illness were registered in St. Petersburg. In the words of the 
chief public health physician, foreigners are the source of 
disease in Krasnodar, Rostov and St. Petersburg.

<F P=106> [Article: ``Chernobyl Echo''] </F>
  [Text] (ITAR-TASS) -- An increase in oncological diseases 
of the thyroid gland has been observed among the children 
victimized by the Chernobyl catastrophe in rayons of Byelarus. 
  An increase in cancerous diseases of the thyroid gland after 
Chernobyl had been predicted by specialists but for later time 
periods. In 10 years before the Chernobyl catastrophe, only 7 
cases of thyroid cancer were discovered in children. In 1990 
alone, 47 such cases were recorded, and 43 cases were recorded 
in the first half of 1993. The overwhelming majority of cases of 
disease have occurred in the Gomel Oblast. Ranking second is not 
the Mogilev Oblast as might be expected, but rather the Brest 
Oblast. 
  The village of Olmany in the oblast's Stolin Rayon, which 
used to be known in Byelarus for its literature thanks to Yakub 
Kolas's novel ``Tryasina'' has now become famous for its 
``radiation.'' The level of contamination of the soil with 
cesium in this swamp-surrounded small corner is just 1-5 
Ci/km[.sup]2[/]; however, the coefficient of radionuclide 
transfer into products grown here is extremely high. 
  Gastrointestinal tract injury has been noted in many 
children 
of the village of Olmany, and the health of 77 children (of the 
250 living here) is in such a threatened state that oncological 
diseases are inevitable in several years for them without 
preventive medical measures. In 1991 physicians discovered 
dangerous changes in the digestive systems of 8.1 percent of 
Olmany's children, whereas today every fourth child has such 
changes. 
  Specialists confirm that local residents must either be 
resettled or completely switched over to products that are 
shipped in. Indeed, even giving the children here regular trips 
to Germany, Italy, and summer rest bases in clean rayons to 
improve their sanitary conditions will not help them because 
after they return home, their health status will return to its 
previous level owing to strong irradiation.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Shimanskiy of RIzvestiyaS, under the </F>
title:Rumors of an Infectious Epidemic in the Polesye Somewhat 
Exaggerated] 
  [Text] There is drinking water crisis in the southern 
regions of the Belorusan Polesye, where a natural disaster had 
taken place: it is unfit for consumption. The water in rural 
wells has been mixed with debris, fertilizers, and herbicides, 
and it has been contaminated with radio-nuclides. How can it be 
drunk? 
  Some journalists have increasingly been whipping up fear; 
they have reported that hordes of rats have appeared in the 
affected regions, and they are carriers of infection. I have 
talked with the Director of the Brest Oblast Center of Hygiene 
and Epidemiology, Nikolay Lyakhov. Flooding, he says, of course 
has complicated the ecological situation, but we foresaw this 
and prepared ahead of time. The situation is overall under 
control.S 
  What specifically is being done? Hyperchlorination has been 
introduced into the water lines in order to prevent outbreaks of 
mass infectious diseases. Farm-by-farm rounds and special 
monitoring of wells are regularly being carried out in the rural 
areas. Analysis of the water is being done regularly. It is 
being boiled before consumption. If it can be seen as the result 
of analysis that pesticides have penetrated the wells, the water 
is pumped out to the point of complete purity. This is heavy 
work, but the villagers are helping the firefighters. 
  With regard to the radio-nuclides, in the words of Lyakhov, 
they are being flushed from the soils, and the rivers of the 
Polesye are carrying them into the Dnepr; thus nature itself is 
removing some of the radionuclides remaining after the Chernobyl 
catastrophe. The hordes of rats, he continues, are a fairy tale. 
No one has seen them anywhere. Of course, the flooding has 
driven wild animals and various rodents from their habitats. 
But, they are not threatening the inhabitants in any case. 
  Emergency commissions are working in each affected region, 
the epidemiologist asserts. So far there are no grounds for 
panic; the number of infectious illnesses in the flooded regions 
is within the limits of last year's level.

  [Text] The sanitary and epidemiological situation in Tblisi 
causes serious concern among experts. The city is truly facing a 
threat of an outbreak of epidemics, says the chief state 
sanitary physician in the republic. 
  The first alarm signal was received in March of last year. 
More than 150 people were affected back then as a result of a 
dysentery epidemic outbreak. The reason was damage to the water 
supply network which, when water is supplied to the population 
on schedule, was responsible for bacteriologically contaminated 
water entering the water pipeline. 
  Yet it appears that the city authorities are not 
particularly 
concerned about it. The city water supply network which has 
outlived every permissible life span continues to supply water 
with an unknown composition to houses in its original 
incarnation. 
  The situation is even further aggravated this year due to an 
acute energy crisis. For months, household garbage is not hauled 
away from the city, and there is no gasoline. The city hall was 
forced to appeal to the population to fill the garbage trucks, 
whenever possible, with their own fuel whose prices have reached 
record levels--1 l of gasoline fetched $1.20. 
  And until the fuel problem is solved, the epidemiological 
situation has a potential to get out of control any moment.

  [Text]The first AIDS patient has died in Kazakhstan. It 
turned out to be a woman form Taldy-Korgan Oblast. Her husband 
is from Rostov Oblast. For this reason, in the opinion of 
physicians, the possibility cannot be ruled out that this 
terrible disease was brought in from a neighboring foreign 
country. 
  Murat Saparbek, deputy director general of the republic's 
Center for AIDS Control, informed us that teams of physicians 
have been sent to Taldy-Korgan Oblast to carry out preventive 
measures, since this is already the second case of HIV infection 
noted in the region. 
  In all, however, we are informed by the newspaper KARAVAN 
there are 19 registered HIV carriers in Kazakhstan. Three of 
them are homosexuals and two are preschool children. Nine AIDS 
patients are foreign students who have been deported from this 
republic.

correspondent: ``Cholera Arrived by Aircraft''] 
  [Text] When the aircraft came in for a landing with its 
lights flashing, the earth became silent in alarm as the 
``ambulance'' flashed its blinkers. Much was known about the 
imminent arrival; however, much also remained to be 
explained...The main thing was that the city was ready for this 
menacing danger. 
  All of the flight crew and stewardesses of the Kazakh Civil 
Aviation Administration had been warned. At the slightest 
suspicion (and they had the symptoms listed in a special 
administration directive), each was obliged to quickly report to 
``the authorities.'' On this Karachi-Almata flight, several 
stewardesses immediately noticed that something was wrong. More 
than 50 passengers ``besieged'' the restroom... 
  Almata's best communicable disease specialists gathered at 
the airport. All the necessary analyses were performed there. 
The passengers (mainly ``shuttle'' passengers dragging trunks 
with imported pieces around the entire world) were agitated by 
the delay but agreed to be examined. They rejected the 
suggestion of a dangerous disease with dignity. In one voice 
they stated that they had eaten tainted chicken. This 
``unfortunate bird of yesterday'' turned out to be fatal for 15 
persons. Analyses revealed that cholera was indeed in the city. 
Addresses and phone numbers were taken from all of them. But 
their thirst for profit turned out to be stronger than their 
fear for their relatives and close friends and, ultimately, for 
their own lives. Many addresses turned out to be made up. The 
flight's passengers were sought through the Department of Visas 
and Registration of Foreign Citizens [OVIR], the passport desk, 
and their relatives and acquaintances. And only after 3 days 
were the ``ones who had broken away'' quarantined. All of the 
passengers were hospitalized except for one. The Pavlodarsk 
militia is on his trail. The rest are accepting treatment. Just 
like their ``contacts'' -- their acquaintances and relatives -- 
they have been placed in a special isolation unit. And a 
hospital with the necessary subdepartments has been set up for 
the patients in Almata. 
  An emergency government commission meets twice daily to 
clarify the scale of the problem and take measures to keep the 
infection from spreading. The problem is that among the 
passengers were many residents of neighboring oblasts. One was 
detained in Ufa and another in Omsk. 
  At first, the physicians tried to act independently. But 
when 
the ``businessmen'' began refusing hospitalization, they were 
forced to seek the militia's assistance. And one patient was 
``caught'' three times. The hospital is now carefully guarded. 
  At the time, Kazakhstan's government declared a state of 
emergency in the republic's capital. It lasted another 10 days 
after the last patient was discovered. The city was surrounded 
by militia posts, cordons, and barricades. It did not end 
without deaths. There were cases where tomatoes that summer 
residents had brought from their own garden plots were shaken 
out of trunks. The Central Market was closed for 2 days. Street 
trade was banned, and questionable soft drinks were dumped. 
  To a certain degree, the cholera did not develop by 
accident. 
It developed primarily because Kazakhstan, having declared its 
sovereignty, slammed its doors and windows to the world at large 
and did not care about what was beyond its threshold -- not just 
electronics and pantyhose but also an ``easily accessible'' 
infection. When setting up economic and cultural ties, the 
authorities simply forgot about their main obligation -- to 
protect their people's health. There are heaps of rubbish two 
steps from the presidential palace. 
  What is most, if you please, deplorable is that the legal 
aspects of the problem have been left absolutely not worked out. 
I asked A. Kurmangaliyeva, deputy chief public health physician 
of the Republic of Kazakhstan, whether the government intends to 
lodge a claim against Pakistan. It turns out that this question 
was not even considered.

``$100,000 To Fight Mosquitoes''] 
  [Text] Alma-Ata -- Sendlek Shaukhamanov, head of the 
Kzyl-Ordinsk Oblast Administration, has decided to allocate 
$100,000 to destroy mosquitoes. 
  These insects have become a real calamity not only in the 
oblast but also in the oblast center itself, where they do just 
dandy in chronically inundated homes. The oblast administration 
has decided to purchase the preparation Butax in France and put 
an end to the infinity of mosquitoes.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent M. Khamidov: ``Infection Gathers a </F>
Generous Harvest''] 
  [Text] The incidence of brucellosis among people nearly 
tripled in recent years in Osh Oblast. Three hundred sixty-four 
cases of infection by this extremely serious ailment, which 
often leads to disability, were registered last year. The 
especially dangerous infection is gathering its terrible harvest 
in Alayskiy, Chon-Alayskiy, Uzgenskiy, Kara-Kuldzhinskiy and 
Kara-Suyskiy rayons. The economic damages from brucellosis have 
exceeded 2 million rubles. Over 10,000 man-days have been lost. 
  The main cause of the misfortune is poor sheepherding 
practices. Attention to public health and veterinary measures 
recently dropped abruptly. Moreover the veterinary service is 
experiencing the most acute shortage of everything. According to 
data from specialists of the oblast epidemiological station, the 
availability of individual equipment protecting against 
brucellosis infection and of detergents and disinfectants to 
livestock breeders barely covers 30 percent of the need. 
  Ten annual salaries (one-time assistance) plus the monthly 
salary--such is the amount of the pension paid to a shepherd 
deemed to be group 1 disabled. But wouldn't it be better to 
spend this money to eliminate the cause of the misfortune--to 
improve the condition of the herd and upgrade the quality of the 
sector's management?

IZVESTIYA correspondents: ``There Is Still No AIDS Epidemic in 
East Europe. Can It Be Avoided?''; first paragraph is boldface 
IZVESTIYA introduction] 
  [Text] According to the most restrained World Health 
Organization forecasts, if prevention is not significantly 
intensified, at least 30-40 million men, women, and children 
throughout the entire planet will be infected with HIV by the 
year 2000. 
  At a Riga meeting of health and finance ministers from 35 
European countries that was organized by the European regional 
office of the World Health Organization, the latest statistics 
regarding development of the AIDS epidemic in the region were 
made public. 
  Among the East European countries, Romania heads the sad 
list 
of number of recorded cases per 100,000 population. Following 
after it are Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary, a number of countries, 
and only then the Russian Federation. Not long ago, our 
specialists in communicable diseases even expressed cautious 
optimism regarding the slow development of events. 
  ``In Southern Asia,'' said Michael Merson, director of the 
World Health Organization's global program for fighting AIDS, 
``the pandemic is now proceeding at the same swift paces as in 
Africa at the end of the 1970s. A half million inhabitants of 
Asia are now infected. And six years ago the number of those 
known to be infected was in the single digits. This happened 
largely because of the naive assumption that people in Asia are 
immune to AIDS. If all possible measures are not taken now, a 
tragedy may play out in Central and East European.'' 
  On the basis of other countries' experience, a silent, 
hidden 
epidemic initially proceeds for about 10 years. Then comes an 
overt epidemic, where infections and patients are recorded every 
hour of every day. It has been emphasized that if resources are 
not invested in preventing HIV infection now, the subsequent 
swift development of events will be simply impossible to manage. 
As Luxemburg's Minister of Health has put it, ``Pay now or pay 
later.'' 
  Specialists from the World Bank participated in the meeting, 
which was called ``Investments in Health Protection.'' They are 
now working out a decision regarding how much money to invest in 
preventing HIV infection. 
  Doctor Antonio Campos, the World Bank's chief specialist in 
health care investment, stated, ``Expenditures to prevent AIDS 
are not at all unprofitable. On the contrary, they are among the 
most profitable types of capital investments that the world 
community can make. The point is that on this very day, the 
epidemic is incapacitating the young and most capable members of 
society. According to today's estimates, direct health care 
costs in connection with AIDS in 1992 totaled $5 billion 
throughout the world. If the indirect costs of the epidemic are 
taken into account, that figure must be multiplied by 10. And 
that still does not include the economic losses.'' 
  The future largely depends on today's efforts. In 
development 
of the epidemic, East European is lagging 5-6 years. And it is 
especially important that this time be used effectively because 
the economies of most countries in the region are not in the 
best condition. What kind of resources must be invested in 
preventing an epidemic in Central and East European? About $248 
million is needed to provide the public with condoms and market 
them. The costs of treating patients amount to about $151 
million. Measures regarding ``sex industry'' workers and their 
clients will cost about $48 million. Public health education in 
schools will cost a bit less, about $46 million. Among other 
items of expenditure, the following should be noted: preventing 
in-hospital infection ($25 million); running a mass media 
campaign ($15 million); guaranteeing the safety of blood and 
blood products; preventing infection among drug addicts, and 
developing national programs. These are approximate figures. 
  Participating in the meeting were the Baltic countries, 
Russia, and virtually all other states of the CIS -- Ukraine, 
Byelarus, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. 
Ilona Kikbush [transliteration], a department director of the 
World Health Organization, said that for the first time, 
physicians and financial experts were discussing the problems of 
AIDS together. This was dictated by the very logic of life: In 
keeping society healthy, the medical community is far from the 
sole and main player. 
  Experts from Switzerland and England talked about their 
interesting experience. There is a very strong preconceived 
opinion that it is impossible to affect anything connected with 
sexual bias. Switzerland's experience says otherwise. As a 
result of an active campaign, 60 percent of the country's young 
people use condoms (only one third of that amount did 
previously). The campaign in the Swiss mass media was run under 
the slogan: Be faithful to your partner or to a condom. There is 
a popular picture postcard where a condom is, please forgive me, 
in place of the sun. 
  Perhaps this material will seem frivolous to someone. The 
life of several generations is at risk, however. It is therefore 
necessary to have open and frank talks with children and youths, 
so that this is not interpreted as bawdiness. 
  There is the opinion that early teaching of knowledge about 
sex life education in schools will push children to very early 
sex. On the contrary, in reality, children and adolescents with 
whom sex has been seriously discussed are in no hurry to begin 
swimming in the ``sea of love.'' Among children who have been 
prepared, there is a decrease in the number of adolescent 
pregnancies and in the number of HIV infections. Who knows, 
perhaps, the infected child who drew himself and wrote ``I'm 
infected...Hug me, I am not dangerous!'' may have been born that 
way out of someone's fear of explaining the consequences of 
unsafe sex...The drawing has become a popular banner in many 
countries. 
  The meeting participants erected a small column on one of 
Riga's streets. It was made of stones with the names of people 
from different countries who have died of AIDS. A stone 
commemorating the event was also laid alongside the Domskiy 
Cathedral. 
  The following reminder was sounded again and again in the 
speeches of the delegates from the different countries: No one 
form of sexual behavior should be considered criminal. Not one 
of those persons infected or ill should be subjected to 
ostracism and discrimination. 
  The meeting participants approved a document entitled the 
``Riga Initiative.'' It is a call for active action and a 
program of special measures to prevent an AIDS epidemic in 
Central and East European in 1993-1996. The document pays 
serious attention to protecting the dignity of infected and ill 
persons, adhering to the principles of physicians' ethics, and 
complete confidentiality of tests and treatment.

  [Text] A radioactive container was detected in the 
territory of the former Severnyy camp where first a Soviet, and 
later a Russian division had been headquartered for many years 
at the center of Vilnius. It is reported that the source is 
emitting 3,300 R/h. 
  It is not clear how it appeared there since after the 
transfer the territory was carefully examined by experts. Much 
has been written about the harm inflicted to Lithuania by the 
former Soviet Army, and each case of environmental damage is 
carefully documented. Lithuanian experts have long suspected 
that radioactive substances may remain in the territory of 
former military units, but even in the camps which house missile 
divisions, nothing has been found thus far. The problem mostly 
amounted to soil contamination with petroleum products. Here, 
the military units indeed ``worked hard.'' In some places, the 
soil was penetrated so deep that cleanup calls for enormous hard 
currency outlays. A lot of petroleum products penetrated the 
soil even in the territory of the Severnyy camp. This was 
established by environmental experts. Yet this contamination did 
not pose a serious problem for the future of this territory. The 
municipal administration has decided to set up the largest 
business center in the region on this spot with offices, hotels, 
and banks. 
  I do not think that the unpleasant finding will destroy 
these 
cheerful prospects.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Bayduzhiy: ``Lethal Infection Has Reached </F>
Moscow: For First Time in Recent Years Cholera Not Brought in 
From Abroad''] 
  [Text] ``Russia continues to remain in an extremely tense 
epidemiological situation with respect to quarantine and 
especially dangerous infectious diseases,''announced Anatoliy 
Monisov, Russia's deputy chief public health physician at 
yesterday's press conference at the Russian Federation State 
Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. ``Above all, 
this applies to the situation that has developed this year with 
respect to cholera morbidity.'' 
  For fairness' sake, it must be said that cases in which this 
disease has been discovered in Russian territory have been been 
noted before. They were all, however, attributed to the disease 
being carried in from abroad. The biggest cholera outbreak 
occurred in 1990 at one of the tourist hotels in the Stavropolsk 
kray, where 49 persons took ill and were immediately 
hospitalized as a result of contact with infected arrivals from 
Siberia. In the past 2 years, the infection was brought in to 
our country from Indochina: In 1991, two such cases occurred, 
and in 1992 there were already five. The situation has continued 
to worsen this year. In July-August alone, 17 patients and 
carriers of the vibrio linked to cholera being carried in from 
India, Pakistan, and Turkey have been recorded in Makhachkala, 
Nizhniy Novgorod, Krasnodar, and Naberezhnyye Chelny. 
  Although physicians have somehow become accustomed to 
cholera 
imported from abroad, the occurrence of ``local'' foci of 
cholera on Russian territory has not been seen since the end of 
the 1970s and has become an unpleasant novelty for them. 
Nevertheless, the absence of patients did not, in the 
specialists' opinion, mean that cholera was completely over 
within the country. Vibrios have been isolated from open water 
reservoirs in many regions, including in Moscow, even in the 
best years. 
  The storm finally hit this summer. A fishermen who drank 
untreated water from the local canal became ill and died in 
Kaspiysk (Dagestan). The disease was also discovered in his 
wife. At the republic hospital in Makhachkala, a 4-month-old 
child has been found who contracted the disease elsewhere. 
  A second case of cholera caused by local sources has already 
occurred in Moscow. Here on 8 August, a vagrant suffering from 
cholera was brought to the No. 2 Clinical Infection Hospital. 
Yet another person from those with whom he socialized turned out 
to be a carrier of the disease's causative agent. If one 
considers that there are generally 10 carriers of the cholera 
vibrio for one patient, it is entirely possible that he may not 
be the last. Physicians continue to actively seek all those who 
had been in contact with the patient.

  [Text] Cholera has been carried to us in Tajikistan from 
neighboring Afghanistan, where an epidemic of this dangerous 
disease has been raging for more than 2 months. As of today, 14 
cases of an acute form of cholera and 2 carriers of the vibrio 
have been recorded in the Pyandzh rayon near the border. As was 
reported in the main sanitary-epidemiological administration of 
the Republic of Tajikistan Ministry of Health, all possible 
measures to localize the trouble are being taken. A medical team 
consisting of specialists -- specialists in communicable 
diseases, epidemiologists, and bacteriologists -- was 
immediately created and began working, and three special 
laboratories were set up. 
  The Pyandzh rayon was announced closed: The shipment of 
agricultural products in and out of the rayon was banned, and it 
was recommended that water from open sources not be used even 
though they were disinfected. Measures were taken to transport 
pure drinking water from wells to the population. Physicians are 
taking a full system of antiepidemic measures. Persons suffering 
from or suspected of suffering from cholera are actively being 
sought and hospitalized. The entire population of the rayon is 
being examined. But there is an acute shortage of medicines and 
medical equipment. 
  Tajikistan's grave socioeconomic condition is now becoming 
increasingly more complicated. In view of this fact, the 
republic's Ministry of Health has turned to international 
organizations -- the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and 
Physicians Without Borders -- with a request for emergency aid. 
Walter van Empelen, coordinator of the group Physicians Without 
Borders, has already responded that the necessary antibiotics 
and other means of fighting cholera will be sent to Tajikistan 
from Brussels on Sunday 24 July. 
  In the specialists' opinion, there is still a threat that 
cholera will be carried from Afghanistan into other southern 
rayons of the Republic of Tajikistan, whose borders are 
constantly being violated by mojahedin and members of the Tajik 
opposition, in whose camps different infections are widespread. 
In addition, these days the return of more than 6,000 Tajik 
refugees through Termez and about 4,000 in the Nizhniy Pyandzh 
rayon is anticipated. There is no guarantee that these people 
who are to return to several southern rayons of their native 
republic are not carriers of infection. Beyond this stands the 
menacing threat of a cholera outbreak in other regions at any 
distance.

<F P=106> [Article by Lyubov Latypova, journalist: ``Cholera Exists </F>
But One Must Pay for Information About It''; first paragraph is 
boldface NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA introduction] 
  [Text]Alamkhon Akhmedov, health minister of the 
Republic of Tajikistan, acknowledged that a variety of cholera 
has indeed been discovered in several dozen cases in the Pyandzh 
and Kolkhozabad rayons. As a member of the World Health 
Organization [WHO], he informed WHO headquarters of this fact in 
a telegram and asked for assistance. 
  The focus is completely localized at the present time. 
Cholera is not yet in the Kolkhozabad rayon, and a team of 100 
persons including experienced bacteriologists from Russia are 
working in the Pyandzh rayon. The minister announced that as far 
as physicians from remote foreign lands are concerned, their 
presence at the focus of the epidemic is not necessary and they 
will not be let in. As far as the cause of the two lethal 
outcomes is concerned, it is impossible to say precisely whether 
they were due to cholera or some other serious diseases from 
which those who died suffered. There are no grounds for panic, 
and rumors regarding the cause of the appearance of cases of 
cholera in Dushanbe are unfounded. 
  However, the telegram from the minister to the WHO 
headquarters in Copenhagen was sent on the very day that his 
deputy Anatoliy Kopyltsov stated in IZVESTIYA that there is no 
cholera in Tajikistan. How is this to be understood? In response 
to this question, Akhmedov said that exciting panic in the 
republic on this score would serve no purpose. 
  I myself can add one curious detail. Before giving even this 
incomplete information, the deputy minister demanded that we 
reach an agreement to pay him. As arguments he said the 
following. First, he had already been on his feet for 12 hours 
and is not obliged to waste his time talking to a journalist. 
Second, information is a commodity that is worth money. Third, 
he has already sold information to the BBC at a dollar a 
paragraph. All of this would have looked like an unfortunate 
joke had the discussion not taken much more time that the actual 
information itself.

  [Text] According to data of the Ukrainian AIDS Prevention 
and Control Center 303 HIV carriers have been discovered in 
Ukraine, including 191 foreigners and 112 Ukrainian citizens. 
  Fifteen of the HIV carriers are children. Nine of them were 
infected by their mothers, one was infected during transfusion 
of blood containing immunodeficiency virus, and five were 
infected during medical procedures. 
  Twelve persons have fallen ill with AIDS, to include five 
children. Nine persons have died--four children and five adults. 
  Virus carriers were detected in 21 out of 24 Ukrainian 
oblasts, in the Crimea, and in Kiev and Sevastopol. The most 
unfavorable situation has evolved in Odessa Oblast (43 cases of

Ukraine National Committee for the Fight Against AIDS, Kiev, 
under the ``Your Health'' rubric: ``AIDS Spares No One''; first 
paragraph is boldface DELOVOY MIR introduction] 
  [Text] 
In September of last year, the National Committee for the 
Fight Against AIDS was formed under Ukraine's president, and 
this April in Riga Ukraine signed a document called the ``Riga 
Initiative'' that is a program of actions and special measures 
to limit the epidemic in Central and Eastern Europe in 
1993-1996. 
  As of 1 April 1992, 311 cases of AIDS had been recorded in 
Ukraine; 120 Ukraine citizens and 191 foreigners were infected. 
From 1987 through 1992, the number of ill foreigners increased 
steadily, and the number of ill fellow countrymen increased. 
  According to data from World Health Organization experts, 
last year there were already 14 million carriers of the AIDS 
virus and 1.5 million AIDS patient throughout the world. 
  In Asia, the pandemic is now proceeding at the same swift 
pace as in Africa at the end of the 1970s: cases numbering in 
the single digits were known 6 years ago, whereas now there are 
already half a million. This is largely because of the naive 
certainty that people there have immunity to AIDS. Similar 
conversations have been heard regarding our people, whose 
genotype has, they say, been hardened by life's abrupt changes. 
Hoping this is naive to say the least. There is no Ukrainian 
immunity against AIDS -- it is a misfortune of all humankind. 
Quite to the contrary, the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear 
Power Plant and significant environmental pollution have made 
Ukrainians more vulnerable to diseases, including AIDS. 
  The only reasonable way out is AIDS prevention. 
  A national AIDS prevention program has been developed and is 
already being implemented in Ukraine. The Ministry of Health has 
created a network of diagnostic laboratories where 5-6 million 
persons come yearly for check-ups. Unfortunately, no test system 
is produced in Ukraine. In the near future, the national 
committee plans to create joint ventures for their production. 
There is Ukraine's president's decision to create an AIDS 
Institute. A special scientific program, i.e., a social order to 
Ukraine scientists to develop drugs to treat AIDS or at least 
alleviate its clinical course, must be developed. This means the 
creation of drugs based on domestic processes and raw materials. 
  According to data from sociological studies, 6 percent of 
physicians surveyed consider it necessary to isolate infected 
persons, and 69 percent vindicate their families' refusal to 
accept them. Many patients have no place to go after the 
hospital. They cannot get a job. We asked the Ministry of Social 
Welfare to organize special residences in Odessa and Kiev. The 
problem must be solved by civilized methods. This was already 
discussed, moreover, at the Riga meeting. It is not the AIDS 
patient who should be fought but rather the disease, and without 
forgetting human rights. 
  All of this creates a great deal of difficulty. It is bad 
enough that we still do not have our own test system or enough 
disposable syringes. There are no quality instruments for 
transfusing blood or performing other medical manipulations. We 
must purchase all this, including reagents, from abroad, and 
until recently, they even levied large taxes on anti-AIDS 
developments at the border, which is completely absurd. 
  For this, we need 13.8 million karbovantsy [the Ukrainian 
name for rubles]; however, only 8.3 billion have yet to be 
allocated from the budget. The national committee's board has 
decided to continue priority financing of scientific 
developments, propaganda, means and methods for protection 
against infection, production and use of disposable instruments, 
and purchase of diagnostica. 
  Of course, there is not enough money. Foreign exchange is 
especially needed. I appeal to businesspersons and those who 
understand the importance and severity of the problem and ask 
for sponsor contributions. Our future and the future of our 
children depends on this.

AIDS:

Out Their Days!'' and under the epigraph ``Wake Up! -- Kozma 
Prutkov'': ``He Who Sleeps With His Coworkers Will Inevitably 
Catch AIDS!''; first paragraph is boldface VECHERNIY KIEV 
introduction] 
  [Text]If you diligently use condoms and do not 
indulge in injections by others' syringes, that does not mean 
that you will keep your body that has already been weakened by 
chemicals, radiation, and the spring weather from the AIDS that 
had perfidiously sneaked in from the West. I, for example, 
recently got hold of a color booklet published by the Republic 
Health Center of the RSFSR Ministry of Health (?) [question mark 
as published] ``The AIDS Problem and Your Workplace,'' and I 
understood that ignoring haunts of vice will not save us from 
this foreign disease: The main danger is waylaying us everyday 
at ... work. 
  The booklet clearly specifies that there are only four ways 
of transmitting the AIDS virus. So you only need to limit 
yourself in a few ways. In summary, at work you must not do the 
following: engage in sexual contacts with an infected person 
(and indeed, there are so many healthy people around!); use 
needles and syringes together with HIV carriers -- have some 
pride and bring personal ones; transfuse infected blood; and 
have children if you are already infected with AIDS. Adhere to 
the above norms and your safety is guaranteed. AIDS, while close 
by, will not sneak into the sterile workplace. 
  All of this would be funny if it were not so sad. The 
valuable scientific material of a doctor of medical sciences has 
been clothed in such a strange form that one wants to respond to 
the publishers with some large-scale work of the type ``AIDS and 
the Absolute Blanks of History,'' ``AIDS and Actions During a 
Fire,'' and ``AIDS and the Causes of the Transport Workers 
Strike''... 
  Possibly, only my sense of humor has atrophied, and the 
other 
50,000 readers (that is the number of copies of the brochure 
printed) will obtain something useful for themselves. They will, 
for example, find out that fear of the illness passes when 
knowledge emerges. I don't know about others, but in my case, 
the fear emerged anyway: Somehow it has become frightening to go 
to work -- Will I suddenly fail to take some path of infection 
into account? 
  And I was given this ``little booklet'' in the Central 
Palace 
of Children and Youth. This type of ``literature'' was also 
generously dispersed alongside a drugstore. And children hid the 
bright little papers in their schoolbags. And then what? School 
will be over soon, and I carry it to work. And there AIDS comes 
out and rages.

  [Text] An outbreak of diptheria has been established 
in Ukraine. As of today, 521 cases of the disease have been 
noted. In the opinion of epidemiologists, the current growth in 
the number of patients is directly linked to the unjustifiable 
sensation over diptheria vaccine that occurred several years 
ago. Because parents refused to have their children vaccinated, 
the rising generation's immunity against a number of diseases, 
including diptheria, is extremely low.

  [Text] Almaty, Kazakhstan, has not declared a state of 
emergency following the appearance of cholera cases in the city. 
All market places were opened on Tuesday [14 September]. Only 
the street trade in pies and beverages is banned. 
  However, the quarantine introduced on Monday has not been 
lifted. Lessons in schools have been interrupted until Friday, 
but day care centers continue to function. 
  According to the civil aviation department, charter flights 
have been stopped to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, India, 
and the United Arab Emirates, as well as to Uzbekistan, 
Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and South Kazakhstan. There have been 
no restrictions in other directions. 
  The acting chief of the city epidemiological service, 
Aleksandr Kim, announced that the 152 passengers who arrived by 
plane from Karachi, Pakistan last Thursday were isolated as 
suspected cholera patients. They are in satisfactory condition. 
  The chief of the sanitation service of the city, Anuar 
Talkimbayev, reports there are 16 cholera patients in 
Kazakhstan, 8 of them in the capital. Treatment is active and 
there is no reason to fear for the lives of the patients. 
  However, experts from the Kazakh anti-plague center claim 
that the type of cholera brought from Pakistan differs from the 
classical form and is difficult to treat by conventional means.

to hospital at famous Svalyava spa in Carpatho-Ukraine in what 
is seen as the first outbreak of typhoid there since WW II. 
Local medical experts say the disease was caused by poor 
sanitation and utilities which lack a centralized water supply 
and sewage system. 
  Members of an emergency medical commission said that 
sanitation requirements were not observed in the construction of 
many of the public lavatories and as a result, the water supply 
system was contaminated by sewage. The situation is being made 
worse because of a large number of holiday-makers from Ukraine 
and other CIS states. 
  However, Ukrainian health officials told Interfax the 
epidemic was contained and that large medical teams were sent to 
the place and measures were being taken to remove the causes 
leading to the outbreak of typhoid.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EC: Commission Considers Extending </F>
`Europe Against AIDS' Programme Until 1994"; as released by 
Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 1 Oct 1993 (AGENCE EUROPE) - On the 
initiative of the Commissioner responsible for Social Affairs, 
Padraig Flynn, the European Commission is suggesting extending 
the Community "Europe Against AIDS" Programme until end-1994. 
Ecu 9 million has been included in the draft budget for 1994 
approved by the Commission. 
  Mr. Flynn stressed that despite the huge efforts being made 
in Europe to combat AIDS, the epidemic was continuing to grow: 
by March 1993, 84,000 AIDS cases had been reported in the 
Community and it is estimated that about 500,000 people are 
infected by HIV. 
  The new measures being proposed take account of the changes 
in the pattern of the epidemic and also the results from an 
interim evaluation of the present 1992-1993 programme. The new 
proposals place particular emphasis on tackling several issues 
of growing concern in the Member States, including: 
  - AIDS and drug abuse; 
  - HIV transmission in prison; 
  - HIV transmission linked to travel and tourism; 
  - the increasing number of women and children with the 
disease; 
  - fighting discrimination against those affected. 
  The "Europe Against AIDS" Programme is implemented mainly by 
supporting projects in Member States in the various areas of 
activity identified in the programme. Projects submitted for 
funding are assessed by an Advisory Committee on the basis of 
criteria such as their relevance for public health and whether 
or not there is a "Community added value". About 80 projects 
had been assisted by end-1992. 
  The Commission also intends drawing up long-term proposals 
for the fight against AIDS; which will form part of the strategy 
on public health being developed on the basis of the Treaty on 
European Union once it is ratified.

<F P=106> [Article: "Disease Ravages Galway Oysters"] </F>
  [Text] The oysters that made Galway Bay famous, earning the 
Irish county &pound;3 million a year, are in danger of being 
wiped 
out by an incurable disease. 
  Galway oystermen expect to harvest hundreds of thousands of 
oysters from mid-November to the end of December, but at the end 
of their first day boatmen had 40 oysters between them, instead 
of the normal thousand for each of a dozen boats. 
  Oyster beds at Clarenbridge, the village that hosts an 
annual 
oyster festival, have almost been eliminated and other areas are 
at risk. The threat comes from bonamia, a wasting disease, which 
poses no threat to people eating oysters but is fatal to the 
shellfish. 
  Environmentalists say bonamia is one of the worst ecological 
disasters to strike Ireland this century. There is no known cure 
and marine scientists have found that its effects could take 
between 50 and 100 years to clear. 
  Michael Kennedy, manager of Ireland's Western Region 
Fisheries Board, said: "Something like 90 percent of the shells 
are coming up empty. It is very, very serious." 
  Bonamia spread to Europe from California, destroying 
millions 
of oysters in France, and reached the British Isles a decade 
ago. In Britain, it was first located in the West Country and 
spread to the south and east coasts. 
  Len Hodges, 70, who runs the Duchy of Cornwall farm, near 
Falmouth, said that before the disease arrived in 1983 he had a 
staff of 18, but had since had to lay off all but three. To 
survive, many farmers have begun breeding the Pacific oyster, 
which is unaffected by the disease.

  [Text] Heterosexual cases of HIV infection are steadily 
increasing in the United Kingdom, while infections among gay men 
and drug users are falling, according to a Department of Health 
report published yesterday says. 
  The figures show that around a quarter of current HIV 
infections are heterosexually caused, although the vast majority 
of these have been through contacts with high-risk partners, 
people overseas, or from people from other countries living in 
Britain. However, there is a small but growing number of people 
infected in this country who had partners in no high-risk 
categories. 
  The report by Professor Nicholas Day of Cambridge 
University, 
for the Public Health Laboratory Service, has looked at the 
likely level of AIDS cases up to 1997, and current levels of HIV 
infections. Taking all risk groups into account, the forecast is 
that there will [be] around 2,400 new AIDS cases a year by 1997 
in England and Wales, compared with some 1,600 from the whole UK 
over the past 12 months. 
  The 1997 figures predict 1,350 AIDS cases among gay men, 165 
among injecting drug users, and 770 among heterosexuals. Each 
year between now and 1997, around 85 haemophiliacs infected with 
contaminated blood products will develop AIDS. 
  After 1997 AIDS figures are expected to fall, reflecting 
behaviour changes in the mid-1980's by gay men and to a lesser 
degree injecting drug users. 
  AIDS cases among gay men may peak this year or next year, 
says the report, but this depends on continued safe sex 
behaviour, and there are signs that in younger gay men this is 
not happening. The unknown factor is how fast heterosexual cases 
will increase. 
  "Whereas AIDS incidence in homosexual males may peak in 1993 
and 1994, the incidence in those exposed heterosexually is 
expected to increase steadily." 
  Estimates of those with HIV now, as opposed to those known 
to 
be infected because they have come forward for testing, puts the 
probable figure for England and Wales at about 27,200, although 
Professor Day said yesterday he inclined to a figure of around 
24,000. 
  The report says that of these 27,180 infections, homosexual 
exposure accounts for 14,890 cases, injecting drug use 4,450, 
heterosexual exposure 6,340, and blood products 1,500. The 
current total number of known HIV infections is 19,524. 
  Researchers have looked at all the known heterosexual cases 
of AIDS and HIV between 1982 and 1992. They say that of the 
total 2,237 infections, 73 percent were probably exposed abroad, 
and 13 percent had a high-risk partner. 
  However, there have been 117 cases of people infected within 
the UK with no known high risks. The researchers have looked in 
detail at 30 of these. 
  The report states: "Although half had previously contracted 
another sexually transmitted infection, the sexual lifestyle of 
these 30 cases was otherwise unremarkable. 
  "Their median number of sexual partners in the previous five 
years was three, 23 had never practised anal intercourse, and 
only one had ever paid for sex." 
  At a press conference yesterday, Professor Day said the 
number of low-risk heterosexual infections was still small, but 
all epidemics began with small numbers and stemmed outwards from 
high-risk groups. 
  He added: "The heterosexual community has to be infected 
from 
somewhere and initially it gets infected by the groups who are 
themselves infected. Once it's in the heterosexual community, 
infection is going to accelerate." 
  Dr. Kenneth Calman, Chief Medical Officer, warned that the 
predictions of a falling number of AIDS cases did not mean the 
threat was over. There were no grounds for complacency.

<F P=106> [Article by Nick Nuttall: "Hospital Finds HIV Rate Low in </F>
Prostitutes"] 
  [Text] Few British prostitutes carry the virus that causes 
AIDS, a report in the British Medical Journal says. 
  The finding, by researchers at St. Mary's hospital medical 
school in London, challenges the view that prostitutes are a key 
point from which the virus can spread into the heterosexual 
population. 
  Researchers interviewed 280 women living in London who 
attended a special women's clinic at the medical school. They 
also interviewed women on prostitution charges at magistrates' 
courts and women at a special drop-in centre and other places 
where prostitutes are known to gather. 
  Dr. Sophie Day, senior research fellow at the school and a 
member of the team, said most of the questionnaires were backed 
up with blood or saliva tests to compare answers with HIV 
infection rates. 
  Eighty percent of the women were white, 25 or 9 percent were 
Afro-Caribbean and the rest were of mainly Asian or Middle 
Eastern background. The tests disclosed that about 1 percent, or 
just two women, had the virus which can cause AIDS. Both 
reported a history of drug abuse involving injections. 
  Most of the women, aged between 14 and 51, claimed to be 
using condoms in nearly all liaisons.

<F P=106> [Article: "Women Face Greater Increase of AIDS"] </F>
  [Text] AIDS in Britain is growing more rapidly among women, 
figures from the public Health Laboratory Service show (Nigel 
Hawkes writes). In the 12-month period ending July 1993, there 
were 171 new cases among women, an increase of 22 percent over 
the previous year. Among men, 1,408 new cases were recorded, a 
rise of only 8 percent. 
  The figures do not, however, suggest that an epidemic of 
heterosexual AIDS is yet under way. Only nine women are recorded 
as having caught AIDS from a partner in the UK outside the 
high-risk groups, against ten in the previous 12 months. The 
great majority of sexually transmitted cases were caught from 
partners abroad (76) or by drug users sharing needles (32). The 
total of AIDS cases in the UK since reporting began in 1982 has 
reached 7,842 (7,264 male and 578 female), of whom 4,893 have 
died.

<F P=106> [Article by Chris Mihill, Medical Correspondent: "WHO Warns </F>
Women of AIDS Spread"] 
  [Excerpt] Women are becoming infected with HIV at the 
worldwide rate of two a minute, the head of the World Health 
Organisation's AIDS programme said yesterday. 
  "A decade ago women and children seemed on the periphery of 
the AIDS epidemic. Today they are at the centre of our concern," 
Dr. Michael Merson, executive director of the WHO global 
programme on AIDS, said. 
  "AIDS has not spared women and their children. On the 
contrary, the epidemic wave has affected millions of them, and 
millions more are threatened." 
  More than 13 million women will have been infected by 2000, 
and nearly a third of them will have died, Dr. Merson told an 
international conference on HIV in children and mothers held in 
Edinburgh. 
  Even if all new infections were stopped in their tracks now, 
total AIDS cases would still quadruple by 2000. Almost one in 
two of newly-infected adults were women. "The number of women 
acquiring HIV a year cannot be counted in the thousands, or even 
the hundreds of thousands. 
  "More than 1 million women will be infected in 1993. 
  "By the year 2000, over 13 million women will have been 
affected, and about 4 million of them will have died." 
  As infections increased in women, so did infections in their 
babies. So far, these totalled about 1 million, and more than 
half already had AIDS.

<F P=106> [UK press release from the Scottish Office : "Latest AIDS </F>
Figures for Scotland"] 
  [Text] An additional four AIDS cases were reported in 
Scotland during August making the cumulative total 422. The 
figures issued by The Scottish Office show that no further 
deaths from the disease were reported during August, the 
cumulative total therefore remains at 284. 
  In the UK the number of reported cases of AIDS has risen to 
8001 - an increase of 159 over the July 1993 figures. The total 
number of deaths from the disease reached 5047 last month 
compared with 4893 in July. 
  Of the 422 reported cases in Scotland 45 percent are related 
to sexual intercourse between men and 32 percent to injecting 
drug use. The comparable figures for the rest of the UK are 76 
percent and three percent, respectively. 
<H5>  Notes to News Editors </H5>
  1. Details of the process of compiling this data and the 
categories used are available on request. 
  2. Epidemiological surveillance of the Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was begun at the PHLS Communicable 
Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) in collaboration with the 
Communicable Diseases (Scotland) Unit (CD(S)U) in 1982. The 
figures announced today are the cumulative totals of cases 
reported. The case definitions of AIDS compiled by the US 
Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia are used for 
classifying and recording the UK case reports. 
  3. Because of the nature of the reporting system, the number 
of cases of AIDS reported each month does not accurately reflect 
the number of cases diagnosed during the period. 
  4. It should be noted however that in view of the long 
interval between infection with HIV and the development of AIDS, 
the trends of AIDS cases and deaths and their distribution 
between risk groups are not indicators of the current progress 
of spread of HIV infection. 
  5. News releases setting out the latest Scottish AIDS 
figures are issued by The Scottish Office Information 
Directorate at monthly intervals. Quarterly breakdowns of known 
HIV antibody positives are issued with the AIDS figures in the 
month which follows the quarter to which they refer.

"Infectious Diseases Evolve To Stage Deadly Comeback"; first 
paragraph is THE TIMES introduction] 
  [Text] Illnesses that scientists thought they had conquered 
with immunisation programmes and antibiotics are beginning to 
reappear. 
  Infectious diseases, once believed to be disappearing as a 
serious threat, have made a dramatic and frightening comeback, 
the British Association for the Advancement of Science was told 
yesterday. 
  "Many old diseases have returned and a host of new ones not 
even dreamt of 15 years ago have made their appearance," 
Professor Michael Levin, of St Mary's Hospital Medical School, 
told the association's annual conference at Keele University. 
"So great is the number of new or re-emerging infectious 
diseases that it would be impossible to mention even a small 
proportion of them in a brief talk." 
  The diseases included AIDS, new strains of cholera, new 
hepatitis viruses, toxic shock syndromes caused by bacteria, 
Kawasaki disease, and new, deadly strains of the Hanta virus in 
America. Such was the complacency about infectious disease in 
the 1960's, when antibiotics and immunisation appeared to have 
conquered them, that by 1970 Britain had only one specialist in 
childhood infectious diseases: Doctor Bill Marshall, of Great 
Ormond Street hospital. Professor Levin said that when he died 
in 1984 there was no paediatrician trained to take over. 
  A bacterium similar to those responsible for scarlet fever 
and rheumatic fever was now causing a new disease in children, 
whose symptoms are fever, shock and multiple organ failure. The 
disease, called streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, is, like 
rheumatic fever, caused by a streptococcus. 
  Another new disease, named after the Japanese doctor who 
first described it, was now the commonest cause of acquired 
heart disease in children in many countries. Kawasaki disease 
has affected more than 100,000 children in Japan, striking about 
the age of one. While most children recover in three weeks, 
about 3 percent die from blood clots forming in the coronary 
arteries. The cause of the disease has yet to be discovered, but 
is likely to be a virus or bacterium widely found in the 
community but causing disease in only a few of those infected. 
  Professor Levin said that in Britain the disease affected 
about 180 children a year, of whom one third suffered permanent 
coronary damage. 
  Lyme disease is an arthritic condition in children spread by 
ticks. The cause is a bacterium related to those which cause 
syphilis. 
  Professor Levin said the emergence or re-emergence of these 
diseases showed that the apparent victory over infectious 
diseases resulting from mass immunisation and public health 
measures was merely a lull in the battle. "We appear to be 
facing an endless struggle in which human ingenuity, science and 
technology will be pitted against the evolutionary mechanisms of 
an ancient and infinitely more numerous foe." 
  The new tools of cell and molecular biology meant that the 
threat could be countered, as long as the medical profession 
avoided complacency. 
  -- Professor Robert May, of Oxford University, outlined a 
new 
theory yesterday to explain the long delay between infection 
with the AIDS virus, HIV, and the development of full-blown AIDS. 
  He suggested it was caused by the way HIV proliferates. The 
virus lacks the ability to correct any errors that occur during 
replication, so produces a wide range of mutations. These escape 
destruction by the immune system which is tuned to attack the 
original form of the virus. The system quickly recovers, 
however, and learns to destroy the new variants. 
  Mathematical modelling shows there is a limit to the immune 
system's ability to diversify. When that limit is passed -- 
which could be years after infection -- the disease develops 
into full-blown AIDS. 
  The theory suggests that there might be some patients in 
whom 
the immune system's defences are never over-run. If so, an 
estimated 10 to 20 percent of HIV-infected people will never 
develop AIDS.

<F P=106> [Article by Nigel Hawkes, science editor: "Diphtheria Alert </F>
Clears Jab Stocks"] 
  [Text] Supplies of adult diphtheria vaccine in Britain have 
run out just as the foreign Office has warned travellers to 
Russia to have booster jabs. 
  An epidemic of the disease has caused a run on supplies, and 
yesterday Regent Laboratories, the sole importers, said it would 
have no more before October. A combined tetanus and diphtheria 
vaccine has been available from Merieux UK, but has also run out. 
  Cases of diphtheria in Russia rose from 1,876 in 1991 to 
3,897 in 1992. From January to May this year, 2,828 cases were 
reported. The epidemic is centred in Moscow, St Petersburg and 
Kaliningrad. The risks are greater for people likely to come 
into contact with Russian families than tourists staying in 
hotels. 
  Diphtheria caused 2,400 deaths among 45,000 cases in Britain 
in 1940 but the disease has been beaten by vaccination. 
  Dr. Peter Barrett, of the Medical Advisory Service for 
Travellers Abroad, said yesterday that although revaccination 
was recommended, the risk was not enough to justify cancelling 
visits to Russia.

  [Text] A woman student, aged 19, was critically ill in 
hospital yesterday amid what health officials described as an 
"unexpected increase" in bacterial meningitis among students in 
Southampton, Hampshire. 
  Two other students -- men aged 18 and 20 -- are being 
treated 
for the disease which can be passed on by close contact such as 
kissing or by sharing a glass. 
  Doctors have reported eight cases of meningococcal 
meningitis 
and septicaemia since the beginning of October instead of the 
normal two to four cases for the time of the year. 
  Of the eight, three are students at Southhampton Institute 
of 
Higher Education and two at Southhampton University. 
  Two further cases involved a young girl and a baby, and the 
eighth case was brought in from outside the area. 
  A spokeswoman for Southampton University Hospitals' Trust 
said two of the five students were now well. 
  Of the other three students both the men were improving, but 
the 19-year-old woman was "critical" in intensive care. None of 
the other cases was said to be in any danger.

<F P=106> [Article by Edward Pilkington: "Doctor Claims She Caught </F>
`Gulf Syndrome' at UK Base"] 
  [Text] A doctor who worked on an RAF base in Stafford 
during the Gulf war yesterday raised fears that an unexplained 
illness known as Gulf syndrome could be contagious after she 
claimed to have contracted the symptoms in Britain. 
  The doctor, who asked not to be named, collapsed in June 
1991 
and was taken to intensive care after she developed symptoms 
similar to those suffered by about 500 British and 4,000 US Gulf 
veterans. She had trouble breathing, a high temperature, severe 
chest pains, profuse sweating and sickness. No explanation could 
be found. 
  Disclosures from America have prompted concern that viral or 
chemical component of weapons unleased during the Gulf conflict 
three years ago could have been transmitted genetically to the 
children of returning soldiers. The doctor's statement suggests 
that there may also be a risk of person-to-person contamination. 
  Studies by solicitors suggest there may be up to 500 British 
veterans suffering from the syndrome. Soldiers who participated 
in Operation Desert Storm have reported symptoms as diverse as 
kidney failure, hair loss and flaking skin that may have been 
induced, it is suggested, from agents contained in Iraqi Scud 
missiles or other arms used in the conflict. However, the 
Ministry of Defence says no evidence of Gulf syndrome has been 
found among British veterans. 
  In the months before she collapsed, the doctor had been 
treating six Gulf veterans from the RAF's tactical supply wing, 
which had been responsible for supplying all three services in 
the Gulf with food and ammunition. One patient was chronically 
ill with severe diarrhoea, sweats and pains. Neither she nor a 
district physician could reach a definite diagnosis. 
  The doctor believes she contracted the illness either 
directly from patients or from dead feral cats discovered among 
containers of equipment brought back from the Gulf at the end of 
the war. 
  The cats were found in May 1991 when the containers were 
unloaded at RAF Stafford, but not disposed of in line with 
hygiene regulations, she alleges. 
  "Soldiers at the base thought the discovery of dead cats 
from 
the Gulf was hilarious," she said. "They laughed about it and 
used the corpses as a football." Somebody wrapped one of the 
cats up in bread and put it in the canteen with a notice: 
"Special today -- cat sandwiches." 
  The doctor says she told officers that the cats posed a 
health hazard, but alleges her warnings went unheeded. She 
understands that the dead animals were eventually placed in 
plastic bags and disposed of by civilian rubbish collectors. 
  In response to questions from the Labour MP for Hemsworth, 
Derek Enright, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed that four 
dead cats from the Gulf were found in containers at RAF 
Stafford. But the Armed Forces Minister, Jeremy Hanley, said 
they were cremated and buried. "There is no evidence from the 
station of any health problems arising from the incident," he 
said. 
  On June 4, 1991, the doctor woke up feeling intensely sick. 
"I thought I was going to die. My parents were called to my 
bedside and they were convinced they were going to take me home 
in a coffin." 
  Tests conducted on her in hospitals in Stafford and 
Birmingham showed an unknown foreign virus. Since the initial 
illness she has suffered a range of unusual symptoms: memory 
loss, breathlessness and lack of muscular control. 
  "At times I was unable to walk straight and I slurred my 
speech as though I was drunk. 
  "My father, who was caring for me, also contracted the 
symptoms. He broke out in a rash of blisters and was in hospital 
for two weeks." 
  She has not worked for more than two years and lives on 
invalidity benefit of &pound;90 a week; the RAF terminated her 
civilian post after she was unable to guarantee that she would 
return to work full-time. She was warned by a senior air force 
doctor that if she disclosed details of her illness she would 
never work in the RAF again. 
  After 12 years as a civilian and military doctor, she is 
convinced that Gulf syndrome is more than a coincidence or a 
mere psychological complaint. "The symptoms are so peculiar and 
yet so similar between sufferers that I am sure it is genuine. 
  "What angers me is the cover-up. We signed up to serve for 
Queen and country, and we are prepared to take the consequences. 
But in return we expect to be protected and to be told the 
truth. It is the lies, more than the illness itself, that hurt."

<F P=106> [Article by Marianne Curphey: "Malaria `Not Greatest Risk'"] </F>
  [Excerpts] New findings suggest that ordinary tourists to 
southeast Asia may not need the malaria tablets their doctors 
are prescribing. Older travellers especially are more at risk 
from Legionnaires' Disease and dehydration than from contracting 
a fatal strain of malaria abroad. 
  Research by doctors in tropical medicine, to be published 
soon, will suggest there is almost no risk of malaria to 
ordinary tourists in much of southeast Asia, and most of the 
150,000 travellers to Thailand from Britain do not need to take 
prophylaxis. Those most at risk are people from ethnic minority 
groups visiting friends and relatives and living in close 
contact with local people. 
  Over the last five years the rise in the number of people 
returning to the UK every year with malaria has been almost 
parallel to the increase in the number of travellers. Each year, 
there are 2,000 cases of malaria in Britain, 1,200 of them the 
potentially fatal strain, and about 12 deaths. 
  Dr. Ron Behrens, consultant in tropical and travel medicine 
at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in London, says: "Ethnic 
minority groups are three times more likely to contract malaria 
than ordinary tourists, and research has shown that only 19 
percent use prophylaxis, compared with an average of 73 percent 
of tourists." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Chris Mihill: "Doctors Forecast Bad Winter for </F>
Flu"] 
  [Text] Britain may be in for a bad winter from the 
influenza virus and vulnerable groups such as the elderly and 
heart disease sufferers were yesterday urged by specialists to 
have themselves vaccinated. 
  It is difficult to forecast the extent of influenza 
epidemics, but a leading researcher said early indicators 
pointed to a high level of cases. 
  Last year was a mild winter for `flu, but an estimated 3,000 
to 4,000 people still died. In the winter of 1989/90, considered 
to be an epidemic year, between 19,000 and 25,000 died. 
  Dr. Douglas Fleming, director of the Birmingham research 
unit 
of the Royal College of General Practitioners, which monitors 
flu cases at GP surgeries throughout the country, said that in 
the past overall cases of respiratory illness, rather than just 
flu, had proved an accurate indicator of trends. 
  So far this year such cases were running at 50 per 1,000 of 
the population, compared with half this number for the same time 
last year. 
  "Forecasting is very difficult, but certainly at the moment 
respiratory infections are running at quite a high level. A 
number of strains of influenza have already been isolated. 
  "The message is that flu is about. It is desirable for 
people 
at high risk to get themselves vaccinated." 
  Speaking at a meeting in London organised by the Association 
for Influenza Monitoring and Surveillance, which is funded by 
vaccine manufacturers, Dr. Fleming said it was a misconception 
that flu was a trivial illness, and every year, apart from 
deaths, it put an enormous strain on hospital beds as elderly 
people living alone had to be brought in for treatment. 
  Professor John Oxford, head of virology at the Royal London 
Hospital, said the current vaccine could provide around 70 
percent protection against the three strains of influenza 
circulating this year. Even where people were not fully 
protected, they were likely to suffer fewer complications. 
  He said protection would take place within five days of 
people receiving the vaccine, so although it was worthwhile 
getting vaccinated early, it was still not too late once an 
epidemic had started. 
  Department of Health advice is that the elderly and those 
with long-term conditions such as chest complaints, heart 
disease or diabetes should be vaccinated, as should residents of 
nursing homes, old people's homes and other long-stay 
facilities, where rapid spread is likely.

"Flu Claims More Lives as Expert Declares Epidemic"] 
  [Excerpt] As the flu virus sweeps through Britain in what 
was officially described yesterday as an epidemic, experts 
remained baffled by the extent of the illness it is causing. 
  Another five deaths were reported yesterday as figures 
showed 
178 cases of flu-like illness per 100,000 members of the 
population, compared with the usual average of 40-50 per 
100,000. "I am willing to call it an epidemic," said Douglas 
Fleming, director of the Royal College of General Practitioners' 
flu monitoring centre in Birmingham. 
  The five deaths occurred among 23 elderly patients on one 
ward in Ladywell hospital, Salford, of whom 14 caught the virus. 
Deaths attributed to flu in any winter vary from 1,000 to the 
25,000 estimated for the winter of the last epidemic in 1989. 
Nine out of ten victims are over 65. 
  The rate of increase in flu cases is highest in the South, 
where they more than doubled between October 31 and November 7, 
to 145 per 100,000. But the numbers falling ill are still lower 
than the 201 per 100,000 in the North, where the epidemic 
started. 
  "The rate of increase is not as rapid as in 1989, so I am 
optimistic that this will not be as bad an epidemic," Dr. 
Fleming said. At the peak of the 1989 epidemic, 580 cases per 
100,000 were being recorded and, in 1969, the figure rose to 
more than 1,000. 
  However, scientists could not explain why the virus strain 
causing this year's illness -- Flu A Beijing -- is proving so 
virulent. First identified in China in 1992, it arrived in 
Britain last March but caused few problems. 
  The current wave of illness began in Mississippi in the 
United States last August. It was first detected in the UK in 
October. Alan Hay, director of the Influenza Research Centre at 
the National Institute for Medical Research in north London, 
said that this year's virus strain was little different from 
that of previous years. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Lucy Berrington: "Flu Epidemic Loses its Grip on </F>
Britain"] 
  [Text] Scotland is leading the way towards recovery, 
according to figures which suggest that the flu epidemic that 
has gripped Britain for the past two months is finally petering 
out. 
  Provisional figures for the week ending November 28 show 174 
people suffering from "flu-like illness" for every 100,000 
members of the population -- a fall from 200 in the first week 
of November. Cases of influenza proper are put at 36 per 
100,000, compared with 39 in the previous week. 
  The epidemic started in Scotland and during October worked 
its way south. The figures for the second half of November show 
a similar pattern for its decline. Rates of flu-like illness 
have dropped in the north, from 229 per 100,000 in early 
November to 158 last week. They have reached a plateau in 
central and southern regions, at 200-245 per 100,000, and are 
now expected to fall. 
  Researchers do not know what is causing the decline. Dr. 
John 
Watson, of the Public Health Laboratory Service, said the 
severity and tenacity of a flu virus was impossible to predict. 
"It is determined by the extent to which a population has 
recently come across a similar virus and retained some 
immunity," he said, adding that a resurgence of the epidemic 
this year is possible but not likely. 
  In the week ending November 19, 42 deaths from influenza and 
influenzal pneumonia were recorded at the Office of Population 
Censuses and Surveys, a rise from 28 the previous week and just 
two per week in early October. The number of deaths attributed 
to flu in any winter ranges from 1,000 to the estimated 25,000 
of 1989. In a typical year it is between 3,000 and 4,000.

<F P=106> [Article by Chris Mihill, Medical Correspondent: "Measles </F>
Vaccination Tied to Bowel Illness"] 
  [Excerpt] Vaccination against measles may cause a serious 
bowel condition which has shown a dramatic rise in recent years, 
researchers said yesterday. 
  It is thought that the measles virus, both in the wild form 
and in that used in the vaccine, may damage blood vessels which 
feed the intestines, causing a long-term condition called 
Crohn's disease which results in severe abdominal pain and 
diarrhoea. 
  The researchers stressed that even if the link was proved, 
measles vaccination should not be abandoned, because it offered 
protection against a serious illness with consequences which 
could include brain damage and pneumonia. But there would be a 
case for finding different forms of the vaccine. 
  Andrew Wakefield, director of the inflammatory bowel disease 
study group at the Royal Free hospital in London, said that 
Crohn's disease affected at least 40,000 people in the United 
Kingdom. It caused inflammation and ulceration of the 
gastro-intestinal tract, often requiring major surgery. 
  Mr. Wakefield said studies in Scotland had found that over 
the last 20 years cases in children had risen from four a 
million to 29 a million. 
  There was evidence that the measles virus could cause a 
blockage of the tiny vessels controlling the blood flow to the 
intestines, he told a meeting in London of the British Digestive 
Foundation. His group had identified the virus in a set of 
patients, and other researchers in America and Sweden had 
confirmed the finding. [passage omitted]

Services Correspondent: "12,000 at Risk From Brain Disease May 
Never Be Traced"; first paragraph is THE TIMES introduction] 
  [Text] A new alert started over Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
as women trying to call a helpline found the switchboard jammed. 
  Up to 12,000 brain surgery patients who are at risk of dying 
from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) may never be traced, the 
Department of Health said yesterday. 
  Details of the threat to thousands more patients emerged as 
hundreds of callers jammed an emergency helpline set up after 
the health department announced that a hormone treatment for 
infertility might put some patients at risk. 
  Women complained that they could not get through to the 
helpline despite an increase in the number of operators 
answering calls from 12 to 65. "I am not hysterical about this 
but I want to establish what is going on," said a company 
director who called THE TIMES. "I have been on the phone all 
morning and I cannot get through. I think the way this is being 
handled is appalling." 
  Doctors estimate that 300 women who took human pituitary 
gonadotrophin over a 30-year period up to 1985 may be at risk, 
but more than 100,000 women have taken other forms of the 
hormone and have been jamming the lines. People who received 
growth hormone obtained from human pituitary glands as children 
are also at risk. 
  The department confirmed last night that brain surgery 
patients operated on between 1971 and 1991 who had a form of 
preserved human tissue grafted into their brains were also at 
risk from CJD, the human form of "mad cow" disease. 
  Three patients in the UK have died from the condition after 
brain grafts and there have been five other deaths worldwide. 
The preserved tissue, obtained from the brains of cadavers and 
marketed as Lyodura, was withdrawn in 1991. The health 
department had given a warning about its risks four years 
earlier. 
  Lyodura is a preserved form of the membrane covering the 
brain used to replace the patient's own membrane when it is 
damaged in surgery. It was obtained from the brains of cadavers 
and freeze-dried to preserve it. Scientists assumed that this 
process would destroy the CJD virus but when the first case of 
the disease linked with the material emerged in the US in 1987, 
the manufacturing process was tightened. 
  A second warning was issued by the health department in 1989 
after a second patient died of the disease in New Zealand. The 
British cases occurred in 1990 and 1991. 
  "We have acted at each stage as the evidence has hardened," 
a 
health department spokesman said. Six hundred people a year had 
received the grafts over 20 years, but the chances of further 
cases emerging were "likely to be small," he said. 
  However, the department said later that the disease could 
take up to ten years to develop following infection through a 
brain graft. There is a 30-year incubation period following 
infection through pituitary hormone. 
  The spokesman said it would be extremely difficult to 
identify the brain surgery patients at risk. "Many who had 
surgery wouldn't know whether they were treated with Lyodura. 
Millions of records would have to be checked, some of which may 
have been destroyed," he said. 
  Professor Ian Cooke, who is heading the counselling 
co-ordinating centre at Sheffield's Jessop Hospital for Women, 
said there were records for half the 300 believed to be at risk, 
but some data were up to 25 years old. 
  Only six women who had contacted the helpline had been 
definitely identified as having received human pituitary 
gonadotrophin out of the thousands who had called. Many had been 
treated with human menopausal gonadotrophin, a product obtained 
from the urine of postmenopausal women, which carries no risk.

"Health Chiefs Reject Attack Over Needless Bureaucrats"] 
  [Text] The health department mounted a vigorous defence 
yesterday against charges that the NHS reforms had led to a huge 
increase in health service bureaucrats. 
  Officials dismissed claims by the Welsh secretary, John 
Redwood, that the reforms had been blunted by too much red tape, 
and said that much of the growth in senior managerial posts -- 
up 37 percent in 1990-1, the year the NHS reforms were 
introduced -- was the result of senior doctors and nurses being 
reclassified as managers to streamline the running of hospitals 
and health trusts. 
  The rest of the growth was the result of reforms introduced 
in the mid-1980's following an investigation by Sir Roy 
Griffiths which concluded that the NHS was under-managed. 
However, a department spokesman acknowledged that there had also 
been growth in administrative staff to run the internal market. 
  Mr. Redwood angered health ministers on Tuesday with his 
claim that the government reforms had resulted in 1,500 more 
administrators and managers being appointed in Wales in the past 
three years, but only 20 more doctors. In England, he said, the 
number of managers increased from 1,000 to 10,000 in the five 
years to April 1991 and the salary bill swelled from &pound;11 
million to &pound;251 million. 
  Figures published by the health department last month in 
Health and Personal Social Services Statistics show 
that the management explosion has, in fact, been greater than 
Mr. Redwood claimed. The number of senior managers rose from 
1,200 in 1988 to 13,300 in 1991, and the salary bill rose from 
&pound;30 million to &pound;384 million. But the number of 
nurses fell 
by 9,000 from its peak of 405,300 in 1989, a drop of 2 percent. 
  A note accompanying the figures says the sharp jump in 
managers "reflects the extension of the senior manager pay 
scheme in 1989 to include lower tiers of management ... 
including nurses." This also explains the fall in the number of 
nurses. Also, student nurses no longer work on the wards at the 
start of their training. 
  A spokesman for the health department said senior managers 
were less than 2 percent of all staff and accounted for 3 
percent of the salary bill. Doctors, nurses and other "direct 
care" staff accounted for 65 percent of the salary bill. 
However, the figures cover only the first year of the NHS 
reforms when there were 57 NHS trusts. From next April the 
number will have grown to 389, with a further substantial 
increase in the number of managers.

"Hospital Waiting Lists Go Through 1 Million Barrier, Ministers 
Admit"] 
  [Text] The Government last night acknowledged that more 
than a million people in England are waiting for hospital 
treatment. 
  Provisional figures issued by the Department of Health show 
a 
record 1,017,763 patients awaiting admission at the end of June, 
compared with 994,974 at the end of March. 
  The figures also show an increase between March and June of 
15.6 percent in patients waiting more than a year -- a slightly 
bigger rise than that in Labour's unofficial count published on 
Monday. 
  Labour estimated that the total waiting list had passed a 
million, based on an unofficial tally for the end of April. But 
until last night neither the department nor ministers had 
admitted that the psychologically important barrier had been 
breached for the first time. 
  The official figures for June show the same totals for the 
14 
English health regions, as Labour had collected, but show 11,930 
people, compared with Labour's 10,429, waiting for treatment at 
the specialist hospitals run as special health authorities. This 
includes 275 patients waiting more than two years, despite 
Patient's Charter commitment that nobody should face this delay.

Services Correspondent: "Figures Highlight High-Risk Hospitals"] 
  [Text] Deaths among patients sent for surgery are up to 19 
times higher in some hospitals than in others, according to 
figures that highlight large variations in standards. 
  The figures come as new evidence discloses serious 
shortcomings in surgical practices in many hospitals. Hospitals 
in Harrogate, Lancaster, and Eastbourne are among the riskiest, 
with death rates from appendicitis and abdominal surgery more 
than twice the average, while those in Chesterfield, Bradford 
and Bromley are among the safest, with death rates less than a 
quarter of the average. 
  Reasons for the variation are suggested by an investigation 
into 2,700 deaths after operations in hospital, published 
yesterday, which highlights dangerous practices by some surgeons 
and ignorance of safety measures. The report by the National 
Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Deaths (deaths within 30 
days of an operation), says that too many operations are being 
performed at night by unsupervised junior surgeons on very sick 
patients. Hospitals that lack staff and equipment to care for 
patients safely are failing to refer them to specialist centres. 
  The report is based on confidential questionnaires returned 
by more than 1,000 surgeons and aneasthetists. A quarter of 
those approached did not co-operate. The report says this was 
unacceptable.

<F P=106> [Article by David Brindle: "NHS Waits of 12 Months Growing </F>
by 30 Percent a Year"] 
  [Text] The number of people waiting more than 12 months for 
hospital treatment is growing at an annualised rate of more than 
30 percent a year, according to official figures yesterday which 
show overall queues for operations continuing to lengthen. 
  The figures are for the end of September and the picture 
looks certain to worsen over the winter months as hospitals stop 
or reduce operations on the grounds that their contracts for the 
financial year have been fulfilled. 
  The quarterly September data show 1,030,763 people waiting 
for treatment in England at the end of the month. This was an 
increase of 1.3 percent on the total for the end of June, an 
annualised rate of 5.2 percent. 
  Of the total, 70,512 people had been waiting between one and 
two years, an increase of 7.7 percent since June, or 30.8 
percent on an annualised basis. 
  Another 335 had been waiting more than two years in breach 
of 
the Patient's Charter, 334 of them awaiting treatment by a 
specialist hospital run as a special health authority and one 
awaiting general admission in the South West Thames health 
region. The number of people waiting less than a year rose by 
0.8 percent between June and September, or 3.2 percent on an 
annualised basis, to a total 959,916. 
  David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, described the 
figures as bad news for patients and an indictment of the 
National Health Service market changes lauded by Virginia 
Bottomley, the Health Secretary. With cancelled operations and 
cuts becoming widespread, the queues represented the tip of the 
iceberg. Dr. Brian Mawhinney, the Health Minister, said that, 
compared with September 1992, there were still almost 10,000 
fewer patients waiting more than a year. Compared with September 
1991, the drop was almost 100,000.

<F P=106> [Article by Nigel Hawkes, Science Editor: "Zoo Antelope </F>
Catch Mad Cow Disease"] 
  [Text] Scientists at London zoo have discovered that a 
strain of "mad cow disease" affecting a type of antelope can be 
transmitted much more easily than was thought. 
  The finding uncovers a threat to breeding other species in 
captivity unless it can be shown that they are not equally 
vulnerable. The scientists say there is no evidence that similar 
transmission is occurring among cows. 
  The zoo's small herd of kudu, spiral-horned antelopes 
closely 
related to cows, has been severely hit by a disease similar to 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Of eight animals born in 
the herd since 1987, five have contracted the disease. Only one 
of the five could have eaten feed containing protein from sheep, 
believed to be the origin of the outbreak. 
  The kudu is not the only zoo species to suffer the disease 
since it appeared in cows. It has also been found in domestic 
cats and their larger relations, the cheetah and the puma, in 
eland and nyala, and in the gemsbok and the Arabian oryx. In the 
United States, mink have been affected by it. 
  The infective agent and its mode of transmission are 
unknown, 
but the evidence from kudu suggests that some species may be 
more easily infected than others. Sheep are believed to catch 
the disease by contact with placentas in fields after births, 
but in the case of the kudu even this route seems unlikely. 
  In THE VETERINARY RECORD, the scientists eliminate most 
routes of infection. Infected feed cannot account for four 
cases. Nor can at least three of the affected animals have 
caught the disease from their mothers, who did not suffer from 
it. It is possible but unlikely that the mothers were carriers 
that passed on the infection without having symptoms themselves. 
  If this were so, it would have important implications for 
the 
disease in cows. It is more likely, the scientists believe, that 
an unidentified agent entered the herd in contaminated feed and 
was passed along, as with more mundane infections. Because of 
the danger to other animals, the kudu herd has been isolated. 
  Another danger taken seriously by the zoo, a world centre 
for 
breeding rare and endangered species, is that animals bred in 
captivity could carry the infection when released into the wild. 
If they proved as vulnerable as the kudu, this could be 
disastrous. 
  The scientists say that the next step must be to examine 
whether the agent causing the disease in kudu is the same as 
that in cows. If it is, the conclusion would be that the kudu 
were simply more susceptible to the disease. If, however, it 
turned out to be a different and more easily transmittable form, 
the case for isolating the kudu would be even stronger.

"Cattle Are Tested for AIDS-Like Illness"] 
  [Text] Scientists are investigating what they think may be 
an AIDS-like disease of cattle in Britain. Samples of blood from 
the sick animals are being tested for signs of a virus that is 
related to HIV, the cause of AIDS in humans. 
  Experts on BIV (bovine immuno-deficiency virus) at the 
Institute for Animal Health in Berkshire were called in after a 
cattle herd from a farm in Cheshire developed breathing 
difficulties and other symptoms that resisted treatment. 
  Joe Brownlie, head of the institute's BIV research team, 
confirmed that tests had been run to detect the virus or its 
antibodies. "We are actively investigating," he said. "There are 
no confirmed results as yet. At this stage, it is more of a 
look-see exercise." 
  The Agriculture Ministry declined to disclose details of the 
disease on the farm or its exact whereabouts. Keith Meldrum, the 
Chief Veterinary Officer, said the animals were being tested for 
other viruses as well as BIV. 
  Scientists say they can see no threat from BIV to human 
health because lentiviruses (a group including BIV and HIV that 
is known to provoke slow-developing sickness in horses, goats, 
cats and sheep as well as humans) are highly specific to 
particular species. 
  BIV was isolated in the United States in the early 1970's, 
though initially given a different name. It was only in the 
mid-1980's that scientists noticed the similarity between BIV 
and HIV.

"Unknown Disease Blights Alder Trees"] 
  [Text] Britain's riversides and wetlands are threatened by 
a disease which may be killing the alder trees that grow there. 
Scientists fear the plague may prove as devastating as that 
which wiped out most of England's elm trees 20 years ago and is 
now killing the new elms that sprung from the root systems of 
the old. 
  Fungi is believed to be attacking the alders' roots and 
causing the branches to die back, but experts disagree over the 
seriousness of the disease. The most alarming case is at the 
National Grid Company's environmental education centre near 
Canterbury, Kent, which includes a 20-acre nature reserve built 
around a water filled former gravel quarry. 
  Tony Harman, the centre's manager, began noticing two years 
ago that the tips of alder branches were dying, particularly at 
the top of trees. "Since then it has got a lot worse," he said. 
"We reckon we have now lost about 40 percent of our alders." 
  Some of the trees, their roots weakened, toppled over into 
the water and others have been turned into leafless skeletons. 
Some had to be cut down because falling branches endangered 
school children visiting the reserve. 
  Alders account for up to 30 percent of tree cover on 
riverbanks. Georges Dusart, a senior lecturer in ecology at 
Christ Church College in Canterbury, said: "Alders not only look 
attractive; they are also important for fish life by providing 
river shade and food in the form of insects that fall from their 
leaves. 
  "I have been walking along riverbanks for 25 years and I 
have 
never seen so many alder deaths before." 
  In an article in Farmers Weekly earlier this 
summer, Dr. Dussart asked farmers with diseased alders to 
telephone him. He soon received calls from all parts of England. 
  The Forestry Commission is more cautious about the extent of 
the disease. David Rose, a tree pathologist at the commission's 
Alice Holt research station near Farnham, Surrey, said: "There 
does appear to be a recurring fungal problem with alders. It is 
locally serious, but there is nothing yet to indicate we are 
facing a national epidemic on the scale of Dutch elm disease." 
The preliminary results of analysis of tree samples from the 
Canterbury site suggest that the fungus attacking the roots of 
the alders belongs to the phytophthora family, which 
also cause potato blight, Mr. Rose said. The fungus may have 
migrated northwards from sub-tropical climes. 
  Dutch elm disease destroyed 25 million elms, including 90 
percent of those in southern England in the 1970's. The fungus 
which attacked them was spread by bark beetles. The fungus is 
still present in the roots of the destroyed trees and new elms 
that have grown from the remains of the old are now mature 
enough to sustain populations of the beetles which renew the 
attack.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/01/1994 -- A string of 
projects stipulated in the additional protocol of cooperation in 
health care between Romania and Turkey was outlined to Premier 
Nicolae Vacaroiu by Turkish Health Minister Kazim Dinc during 
the interview at Victoria Palace, on January 11. 
  It is about projects of cooperation in medicine industry and 
cooperation in third markets in this branch, exchanges of 
specialists and experience on intensive care as well as in 
geriatrics and gerontology. The guest also signed in this 
respect the founding act of a branch in Turkey of the Romanian 
Institute "Dr. Ana Aslan," under the aegis of the Turkish Health 
Ministry. 
  Appreciating the additional protocol under negotiation, 
Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu stressed the Romanian Government's 
interest in the development of the bilateral relations with 
traditional partners and especially with Turkey, insisting on 
the future prospects of these relations. 
  At the close of the meeting, Premier Vacaroiu asked the 
guest 
to convey to the Turkish prime minister the invitation to visit 
Bucharest. 
  "I consider the interviews we have had in Romania as very 
useful for both parties," Turkish Health Minister Kazim Dinc 
told the press after his interview with Romanian Premier Nicolae 
Vacaroiu. The Turkish minister referred then to the protocol 
concerning the health field signed in 1991, to the goals of his 
visit, to the ways of developing the health sector, altogether 
subjects discussed during his interview with the Romanian health 
minister, Professor Doctor Iulian Mincu. 
  "We, the Government of Turkey, wish to employ Romania's 
experience in geriatrics and gerontology," said the Turkish 
minister and added that Turkish doctors would come to Romania 
for specialization stages in order to become trainers for 
specialists in the field once they get back to Turkey. 
  An important sector for the development of the 
Romanian-Turkish cooperation is the medicine industry, said 
Minister Dinc, who has remarkably expressed in all his 
statements Turkey's willingness to stand by Romania for the 
better of the worse.

  [Text] Lagos, 18 Jan (NAN) -- Recruits into the Armed 
Forces are now to undergo AIDS tests to curb the spread of the 
deadly disease, the chief of defence staff, Major General 
Abdul-Salam Abubakar said in Lagos today. Maj. Gen. Abubakar, 
who was represented by the director of administration at the 
Defence Headquarters (DHQ), Maj. Gen. Adamu Dyeri at this year's 
enlightenment campaign for soldiers, noted that AIDS was a 
threat to the security of any nation. He noted that about 80 
percent of AIDS cases spread through sexual intercourse and 
urged organisers of the campaign to intensify efforts at 
educating soldiers. The director- general of the Ministry of 
Defence, retired Maj. Gen. Olu Bajowa who was the chairman on 
the occasion, said that most AIDS cases fell within the age 
range of 20 to 49 years while most service personnel fell within 
that age bracket. He noted that the "high morbidity and 
itinerant nature of military duties" increased the potential 
risk of contracting the deadly disease by service personnel. 
Maj. Gen. Bajowa urged the Armed Forces to "establish 
well-defined programme and policies for controlling the spread 
of HIV infection in the military and for caring for those who 
will be affected." Highlights of the event included video shows 
on AIDS and distribution of condoms to all the officers and 
soldiers. The Armed Forces AIDS campaign was launched in 1991.

  [Text] The Science and Technology Agency (STA), the 
Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) and the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery (MAFF), in conjunction with 
universities, have embarked on the development of basic 
technologies to control the infection and outbreak of the AIDS 
virus (human immunodeficiency virus, HIV). This will be carried 
out as a 3-year project from this fiscal year, as comprehensive 
research under the FY93 Science and Technology Promotion and 
Coordination Budget. Through this research, an infection and 
outbreak biological model, which is needed for R&amp;D on the 
treatment of the disease, will be developed. Also, the living 
environment (reproductive cycle) mechanism of HIV, which breaks 
down the sophisticated immune system of an organism and 
penetrates cells, will be studied and the technology to control 
the multiplying and infection of the virus will be developed. It 
appears that this will open up an important path to the 
development of effective treatment of AIDS. 
  At present, the fact that an appropriate biological system 
for experimentation has not been established is pointed out as a 
factor that is hampering R&amp;D on the treatment of AIDS, and an 
urgent response is required. The rapid reproductive cycle of HIV 
and its extremely high variability also are substantial barriers 
to R&amp;D. 
  To overcome these barriers, the comprehensive research 
project will proceed based on three main tasks: 
  (1) Development of an infection and outbreak biological 
model; 
  (2) Development of control technology aimed at the virus 
multiplication process; and 
  (3) Development of control technology aimed at the virus 
infection process. Participating research organizations include 
STA's Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, MHW's 
National Institute of Health, MAFF's National Institute of 
Animal Health, Kyoto University and Tokyo Medical and Dental 
University. 
  The spread of the AIDS virus begins when it couples with CD4 
(receptor) of a helper T-cell. That composite enters a cell and 
begins to multiply, thus advancing to the next stage of 
infection. The virus does not advance to infection if it does 
not couple with the receptor. That is why the chimpanzee, which 
can be infected by the virus, is being used as a biological 
model in current AIDS research. 
  However, using chimpanzees hinders the efficiency of 
research 
because raising and testing chimpanzees is costly, according to 
STA's R&amp;D Bureau. 
  Under this research project, the mouse, in which the 
appropriate background at the gene level exists, will be 
selected as the biological model to replace the chimpanzee. CD4 
will be incorporated into the mouse to develop a biological 
model that can be infected by HIV. However, infection is 
difficult with just the incorporation of CD4. Infection 
efficiency cannot be raised without the addition of a third 
element, which human beings possess. Thus in this research 
project, emphasis will be given to finding that third element 
for infection.

  [Text] There is intense interest by concerned parties in a 
substance called "Paramylon," which may become a revolutionary 
drug for AIDS. They say that this natural substance, which is 
extracted from the Euglena (an alga), has the effect of 
preventing the adsorption of the AIDS virus (human 
immunodeficiency virus, HIV) to normal cells in the human body. 
Side effects are regarded as the problem with azidothymidine 
(AZT) and dideoxycytidine (DDI), which currently are approved by 
the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) as AIDS-resistance 
drugs, and there is strong hope for the development of a new 
drug. Expectations regarding "Paramylon" are growing stronger 
with each day. 
  To be precise, resistance to the AIDS virus was confirmed 
for 
sulfated Paramylon. Paramylon is a polysaccharide that is 
extracted from Euglena, and the AIDS virus resistance was 
discovered because it was known that sulfated polysaccharide is 
resistant to the AIDS virus. 
  It has been confirmed through experiments at the test tube 
level that sulfated Paramylon has the effect of preventing HIV, 
which attacks CD4 electropositive T-cells (which play a central 
role in immune reaction), from adsorbing to MT-4 cells. It has a 
different mechanism from AZT or DDI, which have the function of 
blocking reverse transcriptase. Moreover, since it is a natural 
substance extracted from Euglena, it may be less toxic than 
synthetic substances such as AZT, according to Hideki Nakajima, 
assistant professor of the hygiene department, Tokyo Medical and 
Dental University. 
  However, although HIV-resistant activity was confirmed at 
the 
test tube level for "Dextran sulfate," also a sulfated 
polysaccharide, it was not effective in clinical tests in the 
United States. Thus Nakajima injects a note of caution that "Its 
true effects will not be known until testing with animals and 
clinical testing are completed." Furthermore, although it is 
known that sulfated Paramylon has less side effects than Dextran 
sulfate, it has been confirmed that it acts as an anticoagulant. 
Although it can be said that "Paramylon is an extremely unique 
material" (Hiroshi Sakagami, professor of the Medical 
Department, Showa University), the trend of future research and 
testing must be watched with care. 
  Incidentally, Paramylon itself is being manufactured by 
Harima Chemicals Inc. (4410) and is being sold as a test drug by 
Wako Pure Chemical Industries (at &yen;8,000 for 10 grams).

  [Text] Recently, a research group headed by Professor Shin 
Komiyama of the industrial chemistry division of Tokyo 
University's Engineering Department discovered that cerium and 
other lanthanide ions and lanthanide complexes very rapidly 
hydrolyze DNA and RNA phosphodiester bonding under mild 
conditions. This is fundamentally different from the existing 
method of breaking up DNA by radical cutting, and its most 
unique characteristic is that cutting is done by hydrolysis, the 
same as with natural enzymes. It is predicted that this can be 
used as "scissors" that can cut human DNA at any desired 
location by bonding lanthanide complex to nucleic acid 
recognizing molecules. If it can be given concrete form, this 
will have broad application in research on the treatment of 
cancer and AIDS, and future advances in research will be 
carefully watched. 
  In recent years, advances have been made in research on 
man-made materials that will selectively cut DNA and RNA. There 
are many restriction enzymes in the natural world that cut DNA 
and RNA, but while restriction enzymes uniquely recognize the 
base sequence of DNA and hydrolyze efficiently, cutting location 
is limited by type of enzyme and cutting cannot be performed at 
specified locations. 
  So far, however, artificial restriction enzymes that will 
cut 
DNA by the hydrolyses method used by restriction enzymes have 
not been developed. This is because DNA phosphodiester bonding 
is extremely stable, with a half-life of about 200 million years 
(under pH7, 25C conditions; RNA is about 130 years), and 
the artificial enzymes developed so far break up DNA, and in 
effect cut them through radical generation. 
  The Komiyama group and others have been conducting research 
on cutting DNA and RNA phosphodiester bonding by hydrolysis. In 
the case of RNA, success has been achieved by using a cobalt 
complex as a catalyst, but research had not made progress in the 
case of DNA, which has an extremely long half-life. 
  Based on knowledge gained thus far, the Komiyama group 
conducted research with lanthanide, a trivalent ion like cobalt, 
and as a result, confirmed that cerium and other lanthanide ions 
hydrolyze DNA at a very rapid speed. 
  Specifically, in a pH7, 50C buffer solution, cerium and 
the other lanthanide base cyclic complexes in Figure 1 were 
added to dimer DNA (TPT). The reaction product was measured by 
high-speed liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the cutting 
reaction was studied. TPT peak went down in a few hours and a 
peak was formed for thymidine. There was no formation of thymina 
through radical action, and it was confirmed that hydrolysis was 
proceeding. 
  Other lanthinides also displayed cutting action vis-a-vis 
the 
TPT, but inversion rate after 1 week was only a few percentage 
points. No progress was made with ions of iron, zinc, magnesium, 
etc., and it was made clear that this is a unique characteristic 
of the ions of rare earth elements. 
  Additionally, the electrophoresis result during experiments 
with cutting 35 mer DNA (under the following conditions: 10 
milli-mole concentration cerium complex, pH7.2, 24 hours) was 
that the fragments were consistent with Maxam Gilbert's 
migrating band, and it is assumed that the cut ends formed 
complexes and became equal to phosphomonoesters. 
  From these research results, it is predicted that with 
cerium 
and other lanthanide complexes, DNA cutting action can be 
controlled by ligand selection, and if these complexes are 
bonded with nucleic acid recognizing molecules, cutting by means 
of hydrolysis at any desired location is possible. If the 
technology can be refined, it is expected that there will be no 
limit to the expansion of its use as "scissors" for DNA cutting 
for human and other advanced organisms and cancer.

<F P=106> [Article by city reporter Honda from the "Kasumigaseki at </F>
the Crossroads" series; part three in a series of articles on 
the Ministry of Health and Welfare] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] On 2 July, a reception was 
held among health ministry officials to commemorate the 
inauguration of the ministry's "AIDS Division" -- the first such 
organization set up in the central government or in any local 
government. 
  The Office of Measures Against Tuberculosis and Infectious 
Diseases, which had handled the administration of AIDS, was 
promoted to the AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Infectious Disease 
Division effective that date. The event was held to encourage 
personnel of the new division, but remarks made by senior 
ministry officials in their congratulatory addresses were of a 
rather humorous but cynic substance -- as if reflecting the 
nature of that office. 
  Shuichi Tani, director of the ministry's Health Service 
Bureau, said in his speech: "We certainly hope that this newly 
born division will not be promoted to the status of a department 
or a bureau." Sadaichi Furukawa, administrative vice minister, 
on his part, said: "I pray that this division will come to be 
dissolved for a good purpose." 
  While the rate of the disease's growth is not as sharp as 
that in the United States or Southeast Asian countries, the 
numbers of patients and infected persons have continued to 
double every year since 1990. Even excluding those infected 
through blood transfusion, there were about 1,300 cases reported 
as of the end of June this year. According to an estimate by a 
ministry study team, the number could be "about nine times that" 
if unconfirmed cases of patients and infected are added. Some 
are concerned about the possibility of the "infection becoming 
explosive." There are many who critically contend that "the 
government has been too late in taking full-fledged measures"; 
but a senior MHW official notes that his ministry raised the 
1992 AIDS-related budget by five times the 1991 budget and that 
the AIDS Division has been inaugurated as well. He insisted that 
the ministry has made its position clear that "it is all out to 
take on the issues." 
  But it is still difficult to say that prejudices against 
AIDS 
patients and infected persons have been removed. Many hospitals 
are still refusing to take care of them; there are only a 
limited number of hospitals which are prepared to take them in. 
About the only thing we can see are "AIDS-centered" hospitals 
being readied in a hurry. Japan's measures against AIDS may be 
said to be still in the beginning stage. 
  Now, when there are no drugs to cure the disease, there is 
no 
alternative but for the ministry's functions to be limited to 
those intended for education and information on AIDS. 
Consequently, cooperation with such other offices as the 
Education and Labor Ministries is becoming essential. 
Furthermore, the understanding of businesses must be gained to 
protect the infected's human rights. The system of cooperating 
with other countries needs to be upgraded as well. This means 
that the ministry is being compelled to do things which it has 
not done before. 
<H5>  Concern Rising on Right for Dignified Death </H5>
  Meanwhile, changes in the structure of diseases that have 
been brought about by progress in medical technology are 
beginning to bring about major changes in the direction of 
medical care itself. We can no longer unequivocally say that the 
treatment recommended by a doctor is the best for a patient. 
  What this condition has brought about is a system of 
"informed consent," which enables treatment to be given only 
after a doctor has adequately explained the proposed treatment 
to his patient and the patient has consented to it. The MHW has 
begun to take up the matter seriously, and is now beginning to 
recognize the importance of the right for patients to make 
decisions on treatment as well. Meanwhile, growing rapidly in 
number -- thus raising the concern of the ministry -- are the 
people who do not agree to treatment which is only aimed at 
prolonging life. They support the right to die in a dignified 
manner. This may be a good example that typically shows changes 
taking place in the relations between patients and doctors 
concerning questions of disease, treatment, and death. What 
position the ministry will take with regard to this matter will 
become a task for it to solve in the future. 
<H5>  Growing Responsibility on Ethics Questions </H5>
  Another big issue is one concerning transplanting organs, 
which is being done in the United States and Europe as a normal 
practice. But since this involves removing organs from 
brain-dead humans, it requires a change from the past perception 
on the "death" of humans. In Japan, it is not done except in 
rare cases. 
  As the first reason Japan cannot decide on the organ 
transplant issue despite repeated requests by the medical 
circles, a senior MHW official cited the "people's deep-rooted 
mistrust in medicine." At present, a bill on organ transplants 
is being readied by a suprapartisan group of Diet members, but 
many people in the ministry said: "The medical circles, as the 
professional group, should have been responsible for explaining 
to the people the need for and problems related to transplants." 
The ministry appears to be in a quandary sandwiched between the 
people and the doctors. 
  Over the past several years, there have been a growing 
number 
of people with doctor's licenses applying to join the MHW as 
medical officials. Last year, 50 people -- or double the 25 
actually wanted -- applied. Hisashi Teramatsu, director of the 
ministry's Health Policy Bureau, noted: "Times have changed a 
lot compared to 20 years ago when hardly enough people applied 
to fill the necessary posts." Some think this shows the country 
is entering an era of too many doctors, but a senior MHW 
official thought this only showed there are a growing number of 
doctors getting attracted to the challenge of the new tasks 
faced by the new health and welfare administration. 
  Indeed, before the health and welfare administration there 
is 
now a mountain-load of new tasks it has had no experiences with. 
The problem of a rapidly aging population, the problem of 
pensions that come with the aging, the AIDS issue, the issue on 
the right to die, and the issue of organ transplants -- all of 
these are big topics that have much to do with the basics of the 
people's lives. No doubt, the MHW's responsibilities will grow 
further.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EC: European Parliament (EP) </F>
Condemns Cloning -- It Calls for a Community Initiative To 
Prohibit it at International Level - Plenary Session of the 
European Parliament"; as released by Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] Strasbourg, 3 Nov 1993 (AGENCE EUROPE) - During the 
urgent debates at its session at the end of October, Parliament 
adopted a resolution denouncing the cloning of human beings for 
any reason, including research, as a serious violation of 
fundamental human rights and an act that violates respect for 
the individual, is morally detestable and ethically 
unacceptable. The EP requests the Commission to draft a report 
at the earliest opportunity on any experiments in this field 
that may be underway in the Community and to immediately submit 
a proposal with a view to prohibiting such experimentation on 
Community territory. It also calls on the Community to take the 
initiative internationally to convene negotiations for a general 
prohibition of the cloning of humans. Presented by the Greens, 
this resolution was given the unanimous support of all the 
political groups. 
  As the first parliament in the world to adopt a resolution 
on 
this subject, the European Parliament has taken an extremely 
important initiative in the combat for human dignity, pointed 
out Mr. Paul Lannoye (Greens, Belgian). Expressing indignation 
over what he called "the worst news of the week", Mr. Otto 
Habsburg (Christian Democrat, German) regretted that humanity 
has reached the stage at which reality, in which we can now 
"truly create Frankensteins", is more terrifying than fiction. 
"Nothing stops inventiveness," noted Professor Leon 
Schwartzenberg (Socialist, French), regretting that "duplicates" 
have been successfully created. Justifications exist, but they 
are all unacceptable, he added, before raising the following 
question: "When will women be replaced by incubators?" Human 
beings cannot be reduced to biological material, he went on to 
note. The MEP [Members of European Parliament] concluded by 
calling for legal provisions serving as "genuine commandments 
for humanity" so that Rabelais' famous comment will not come 
true: "Science without conscience is the ruination of the soul." 
  On behalf of the European Commission, Sir Leon Brittan 
recalled that the goal of the American experiment was to help 
couples who cannot have children and that researchers have 
themselves declared that they do not intend to go further. The 
Commission is not aware of any experiments of this type being 
conducted in the Community. In any event, such experiments could 
not receive Community funding. He added that several Member 
States, including the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland and the 
United Kingdom, already have legal provisions banning this type 
of research. Even if no Community legislation exists, there is 
consensus on this question throughout the Community, concluded 
Sir Leon Brittan.

  [Text] Sofia, January 24 (BTA) -- Factor-R, a Bulgarian 
preparation stimulating the immune system, will be tested on 
HIV- positive Bulgarians. The National Institute of Medical 
Preparations endorsed the clinical testing today. 
  It is up to HIV-carriers and persons who have developed the 
full symptoms of AIDS to decide whether to accept the proposal 
for taking part in the clinical tests of Factor-R which will be 
carried out in Bulgaria for the first time. 
  Factor-R has been developed by a medical team headed by 
Prof. 
Bogdan Petrunov, director of the National Centre of Infectious 
and Parasitic Diseases. The team has been working jointly with 
Life Choice International and the Applied Research Combine of 
Pharmaceutics. The tests of the preparation began in October 
last year. It is tested on a voluntary basis in the United 
States, being administered to subjects from Austin, Texas. The 
blood tests of the patient who was the first to start taking 
Factor-R show a definite improvement, BTA was told by Life 
Choice International.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 20 (CTK) -- In 1993, a total of 
3,409,610 people in the Czech Republic were tested for HIV, the 
virus that causes AIDS, with 170 testing positive. Of these, 45 
have developed AIDS, according to Ministry of Health 
information, ministry spokeswoman Marketa Soukupova told CTK 
today. 
  Of those who tested HIV-positive, 150 were men and 20 were 
women. Of those stricken with AIDS, 41 were men and 4 were women. 
  The highest-risk groups were made up of recipients of blood 
and blood products (14 HIV-positive and 3 with AIDS) and 
hemophiliacs (16 HIV-positive and 1 with AIDS). 
  The highest percentage of HIV carriers and AIDS sufferers 
was 
found among homosexuals and bisexuals (16 HIV-positive and 7 
with AIDS). Prague had the highest total of HIV carriers, with 
110 people in various stages of the disease. 
  A large portion of HIV carriers in the Czech Republic is 
made 
up of foreign students and workers, of whom 84 tested 
HIV-positive and one developed AIDS. 
  Thirty-three of the 170 who tested HIV-positive died in 
1993.

  [Text] Tirana, January 10 (ATA) -- RILINDJA Reports 40 
children and 10 grown ups affected with jaundice in two weeks' 
time in Gllogovc of Kosova. Widespread of jaundice epidemics is 
due to lack of vaccination and closing of many heath centers in 
villages, according to RILINDJA issue of January 9. 
  Epidemiologists say that water pipes of Gllogovc might have 
caused the epidemic because the water system of Gllogovc is 
still dirty since Serbian officials of the commune did not deem 
it necessary to clean the reservoir and put chlorine to water. 
Gllogovc is a commune with 100 percent Albanian population.

  [Text] Pristina, January 24 (ATA) -- There was a boom of 
typhus in Kosova last week. Thirty Albanian patients infected 
by typhus were sent to the infective clinic of Pristina. The 
physicians warned there are other patients infected by typhus, 
but this number is not yet made evident. As a result of this 
serious epidemiological situation in Kosova, there are several 
patients infected by hepatitis and rubella who are being treated 
at home because of there is no room in the Pristina clinics. 
  Physicians think that the virus of salmonella must have been 
in the water. Before the boom of the epidemic in Shtimje, in 
which typhus cases have been in a greater number than in other 
zones of Kosova, the violent Serbian organs forced the only 
Albanian epidemiologist to live his job under the pretext that 
"there was no need for him". 
  The violent Serbian organs in Kosova have expelled some 2000 
Albanian physicians and other medical workers from the medical 
institutions of the region. 
  Five hundred Albanian medical workers have been warned to 
leave their jobs recently in Mitrovica and in the communes near 
the president of Kosova Republic, Mr. Ibrahim Rugova, appealed 
in his recent press conference to international medical 
institutions to give aid to Kosova in order to face the grave 
situation there.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on epidemics and diseases monitored by Paraguay Bureau 
from 26 November to 2 December. 
<H5>  Brazil </H5>
  On 30 November, health authorities admitted that a 
meningitis 
meningococcus epidemic has been detected in Rio de Janeiro 
State. They already are discussing with the Health Ministry the 
need to import Cuban vaccine for an immunization campaign early 
next year. Rio de Janeiro and other Baixada Fluminense 
municipalities show the highest rate of the disease. A total of 
2,209 meningitis cases were registered in the state from January 
to 24 November, 499 fatal. Of this total, 725 people had 
meningitis menincoccus and 148 died. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO

  [Excerpts] United Nations, 15 Oct (PL) -- A group of 
experts has estimated that, since it began, the U.S. unilateral 
blockade has cost Cuba $40.8 billion. 
  The figure, considered preliminary by Cuban economists, 
appears in a letter and annex sent by Fernando Remirez de 
Estenoz, Cuban ambassador to the United Nations, to UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and distributed at UN Headquarters 
as an official document of the General Assembly. 
[passage omitted] 
  The report stresses that one of the major strategic impacts 
of the blockade consists in closing Cuba's access to advanced 
technology and any kind of scientific and technical exchange. 
  It adds that in the field of medicines, the U.S. blockade 
has 
had particularly harsh consequences in that it has limited the 
nation's ability to acquire third-generation antibiotics 
essential in treating severe infections and cytostatic 
medication used on cancer patients. 
  Among other problems, the report stresses that the price of 
insulin, which can only be obtained through a European supplier, 
has been driven higher because of the great demand in Cuba. 
There are an average of 16.5 diabetics for every 1,000 
residents, and many Cuban diabetics are dependent on insulin.

  [Text] Havana, 12 Jan (PL) -- Colombian Health Minister 
Juan Luis Londono has voiced his satisfaction with the signing 
of an initial agreement with Cuba to purchase medicine and 
services for $7 million. 
  The negotiations concluded successfully, Londono assured 
PRENSA LATINA at the end of his visit to the island, which 
lasted from 2 to 11 January. 
  Londono said the agreement signed with his Cuban 
counterpart, 
Julio Teja, could double the initial amount involved before the 
end of the first half of 1994. 
  We predict that these purchases will double or triple within 
the next two years, Londono added. 
  Although the minister gave no details, he suggested that 
such 
acquisitions of medicine and services could help Cuba pay its 
debt to Colombia, which unofficial Colombian sources estimate at 
about $45 million. 
  Londono pointed out that this form of payment would "give 
way 
to a revolution, to a debt-for-health swap, which I think would 
be a major innovation in Latin America." 
  In addition to these purchases, Londono added, we also 
reached agreements on exchange and technical assistance programs 
by which Cuban specialists will cooperate in primary care 
services, epidemiological programs, and medicine control. 
  The Colombian minister pointed out that his visit surpassed 
his expectations because the host party was more willing to 
negotiate and cooperate than he had expected. 
  Londono added that they identified a number of possible 
joint 
ventures that will create an aggressive and positive exchange 
system. 
  The minister said he hopes the ties that were established 
will prove durable and will lead Colombia to adopt the 
advantages of the Cuban health system under conditions 
applicable to that country. 
  As for the agreement that was signed, Londono emphasized 
that 
"he expects a successive link of strong trade relations in the 
health sector, as well as in the economic, industrial, and 
agricultural sectors." 
  The Colombian minister described his visit to Cuba as very 
enriching for Colombian society because he acquired detailed 
information about the operation of the local health system and 
about the things that could be useful to his country.

<F P=106> [Article by Chico Otavio: "Diseases of Poverty"] </F>
  [Text] The lack of basic sanitation in over 90 
percent of Brazil's municipalities has caused the return of 
cholera and leprosy, which would have been prevented with clean 
water. 
  The dream has ended. A year after having served as the site 
of the UN Conference on Environment and Development, Brazil is 
confronting the most insidious type of attack on the 
environment: the tragedy of poverty. Diseases considered 
eradicated, such as cholera and leprosy, are returning, exposing 
a reality quite different from the ideals of a healthy life 
preached at Rio-92. The Brazilian basic sanitation system is a 
failure, and has caused the country to spend billions of dollars 
to combat illnesses that could easily have been avoided with a 
mere supply of sewers and clean water. 
  According to the health expert, Paulo Buss, vice president 
of 
education and training at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Fiocruz, 
Brazil's poverty is responsible for the resurgence of five of 
the world's seven oldest plagues: malaria, leprosy, 
leishmaniasis, tuberculosis, and cholera. He claims that the 
deeper the Brazilian recession, the larger the number of 
inhabitants vulnerable to these diseases becomes. According to 
the Fiocruz studies, malaria has already reached the level of 
530,000 cases per year, concentrated in the States of Amazonas 
and Para. Tuberculosis, on the other hand, has totaled 80,000 
cases, distributed throughout the entire territory. 
  Although it failed to evoke the interest of Brazilian 
diplomats, the problem was not ignored at the 1992 meeting. In 
the Health Charter, the principal document produced at the 
parallel conference on environment, health, and development, 
health specialists from all over the world warned of the 
relationship between the inequitable income in Brazil and short 
life expectancy at birth. They claimed that the high perinatal 
and infant mortality rate could be explained by the difficulty 
in gaining access to quality preventive and remedial health 
services. 
  The cholera epidemic is another example of this 
relationship. 
Studies show that most of the 8,000 cases reported this year 
affected the population group earning less than two minimum 
wages. The health experts explain why poverty is an ecological 
problem as well: "Both extreme poverty and extreme wealth are 
associated with predatory use of natural resources, resulting in 
dissipation, pollution, and environmental deterioration." 
According to the document, hasty solutions almost always have 
ephemeral results, often ultimately causing new problems even 
more difficult to solve. 
  Brazil is the champion of ephemeral solutions. During the 
year of Rio-92, the public sector spent nearly $11 billion in an 
attempt to cure the immense contingent of sick Brazilians. Over 
560 billion cruzeiros were spent on consultations at hospitals 
and health stations run by the federal, state, or municipal 
governments, resulting in 13.6 million hospital confinements. 
  In 80 percent of the consultations and 65 percent of the 
hospital confinements, the fundamental cause of the gigantic 
first-aid facility that Brazil has become is just one: the lack 
of basic sanitation. It is estimated that, each year, the 
government spends $2.5 million treating illnesses directly 
caused by the extremely bad conditions under which most of the 
Brazilian population lives. 
  A summary of the poverty (of which hunger is only one 
component) may be observed in a survey conducted by the 
Brazilian Association of Sanitary and Environmental Engineering, 
ABES: 92 percent of Brazil's municipalities lack sewage 
treatment; 59 percent have no final destination for waste; and 
50 percent are without treated water. 
  In the Northern region, where diarrheas rank first on the 
list of diseases with the highest mortality rate, only 2.24 
percent of the population is served by the sewer system. In 
Amazonas, only the capital, Manaus, has the system, and yet it 
is still without suitable treatment.

  [Text] Havana, 5 Jan (PL) -- Havana health officials have 
reported that the child mortality rate dropped to 9.4 for every 
1,000 live births in 1993 -- the lowest ever in Cuban history. A 
simple mathematical calculation shows that the 0.8 drop, 
compared to the 10.2 registered in 1992, is equivalent to the 
lives of 121 children. 
  According to information supplied by the Public Health 
Ministry's National Statistics Directorate (Minsap), in 1993 
there were 151,981 births and 1,430 deaths, which were mainly 
caused by perinatal problems (those that occur in relation to 
the birth process) and by several congenital anomalies. 
  According to Minsap statistics, child mortality rates in 
Cuba 
have been decreasing gradually over the past 25 years. For 
example, the figure was 46.7 in 1969, 19.4 in 1979, and 11.1 
child deaths for every 1,000 born alive in 1989. 
  The 9.4 achieved in 1993 gives Cuba the lowest child 
mortality rate in Latin America -- an area that registers very 
alarming figures, like those in Haiti and Bolivia, which were 87 
and 80 respectively, as reported in the World Infancy Status 
report published by UNICEF.

<F P=106> [Report by Judy Siegel] </F>
  [Excerpt] Peace could promote the spread of AIDS here, as 
open borders and casual sex with foreigners are liable to 
increase the risk of infection, Health Minister Hayim Ramon said 
yesterday. He was speaking to reporters in advance of World 
AIDS Day, which will be observed tomorrow here and abroad. 
  Ramon said his ministry, which this year allocated NIS [new 
Israeli shekels] 900,000 for AIDS information campaigns and an 
additional NIS 4 million for testing of carriers and screening 
the entire blood supply, will have to increase its publicity 
programs when peace comes. 
  He was pleased to report that only 145 HIV carriers were 
discovered during the first 10 months of the year; if this 
relatively slow pace continues, there will be 174 newly 
discovered HIV carriers in all of 1993, compared with 201 last 
year. The decrease, however, could be attributed by fewer 
individuals voluntarily going for testing. The ministry 
estimates that there are one or two undiscovered carriers for 
each known carrier, and some voluntary groups claim this figure 
is too conservative. 
  A worrisome statistic that demands intensification of the 
ministry's information campaign is that half of those infected 
with HIV this year are between 15 and 24. The share of women 
among the carriers is climbing; for every two men who are 
infected, three women become carriers. By the year 2000, HIV 
infection is expected to be nearly equal between the sexes. 
Carriers can expect to live no more than five to 10 years after 
initial infection by the virus. 
  Since women can infect their babies (in the womb or via the 
birth canal), the number of infants with HIV is expected to 
increase around the world. A total of 43 Israeli children have 
been infected by their mothers; six of them developed AIDS 
(three of them died) and the rest are carriers. [passage

  [Text] Some 169 new AIDS carriers were uncovered among 
115,000 people tested in 1993, compared with 201 carriers 
uncovered among 80,000 people tested in 1992. This was 
announced by Dr. Tzvi Ben- Yishay, chairman of the Health 
Ministry's supreme committee on AIDS prevention. 
  The findings point to a 15 percent drop in the number of new 
carriers in 1993 and to a rise in the number of female carriers, 
who now constitute 36 percent of the carriers, compared to 30 
percent in 1992. 
  To date, 278 Israelis have contracted the disease. Of these, 
198 died and 15 left the country. The number of known carriers 
is 1,102, but the Health Ministry estimates their number at 
2,500.

Kazakhstan, several new cases have been reported within the last 
few days," Vladimir Stepanov, Director of the Kazakh Anti-Plague 
Institute, told Interfax. He did not say how many cases had 
been registered but reliable sources say there are 18 of them. 
No deaths have been reported. 
  Stepanov said that the steps that had been taken failed to 
curb the epidemics. 
  Three cases of plague have also been registered in 
Kazakhstan 
this summer. A little girl died in the Aktyubinsk Region. The 
other two patients, a woman in the Kzyl-Orda Region and a man in 
the Atyrau region, are out of danger.

<F P=106> [By correspondents Cao Zhi (2580 2535) and He Xiquan (6320 </F>
6007 3123)] 
  [Excerpts] Lanzhou, 10 Jan (XINHUA) -- Thanks to the 
painstaking efforts of the residents, an air force guided 
missile testing base in northwest China, which has the fame of 
``the Cradle of Miracle Arrows,'' has been turned into a 
surface-to-air-missile city, with trees lining the streets, the 
air filled with the aroma of ripening fruits, and complete 
facilities for daily life. 
  The base is located in the Great Badain Jaran Desert. More 
than 60 grass-roots units are scattered along the 22 small 
settlements in the 4,870 square km desert. People call the base 
``the isolated islet'' because of its extremely difficult living 
conditions. [passage omitted on efforts to improve the living 
conditions] 
  More than 500 college graduates have been assigned to the 
base in recent years. Some 85 percent of them have become 
professional technical backbone elements, over 90 percent have 
performed meritorious service, and nearly 100 of them have been 
rated as outstanding intellectuals or outstanding scientific and 
technological cadres. In scientific research and experiment, 
the base has set the highest records in the number of guided 
missiles launched on a single day, in a single month, and in a 
single year. It is also the first base in China to successfully 
complete a multi- targeting, minimum-altitude missile launching. 
It accomplished more than 100 scientific research and 
experimental tasks with flying colors. Six of the scientific 
research projects filled in the gaps in China's scientific and 
technological field, and dozens of the research results received 
state or military science and technology progress awards.

  [Text] Beijing, December 28 (XINHUA) -- China will continue 
keeping an elite task force of nuclear scientists, the top 
executive of the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) said 
here today. 
  CNNC General Manager Jiang Xinxiong was speaking at a 
national conference on the industry, now focused on peaceful use 
of atomic energy. 
  On the industry's development in the 1990s, Jiang said that 
the country will build up a ``network of nuclear power plants 
and nuclear fuel factories'' as part of an overall effort to 
restructure its energy supply. 
  ``Nuclear industry and technology are a yardstick for 
measuring the overall strength of a country and, for China, a 
pillar for its international standing,'' he said. 
  ``There is no change to the strategic importance of China's 
nuclear industry despite the numerous changes that have taken 
place in international situation,'' Jiang added. 
  Through reforms, he said, CNNC will become a ``gigantic 
enterprise group with nuclear production and research as its 
main undertaking while combining nuclear and non-nuclear and 
civilian and military production.'' 
  A portion of CNNC's human and material resources will be 
devoted to defense production. 
  Meanwhile, he said, CNNC will concentrate on developing new 
types of nuclear power and heat-supply reactors and building an 
experimental fast neutron accelerator, while strengthening basic 
researches in isotopic separation and nuclear fusion. 
  CNNC also plans to build up a task force competent enough 
for 
designing 600,000 kw, 900,000 kw and 1.2 million kw nuclear 
power plants for both domestic and overseas supply, Jiang said. 
  ``There will also be nuclear construction companies capable 
of building such nuclear power plants,'' he said. 
  The work will start on the basis of China's success in 
designing and building, of its own, the 300,000 kw Qinshan 
Nuclear Power Plant, where operations have been normal. 
  The Qinshan facility has been in normal operation and is 
expected to produce 1.73 billion kwh [kilowatt hours] of 
electricity by the end of this year, Jiang said. 
  The No. 1 Generating Unit of 900,000 kw at Daya Bay Nuclear 
Plant in Guangdong Province is to go into commercial production 
in early February, and the No. 2 unit, of the same capacity, in 
June.

  [Text] The government gave an emergency order on 14 January 
to the ROK Embassy in Japan to grasp the truth of the irregular 
export of spectrum analyzers, which are core parts for missile 
development, from Japan to North Korea. 
  The Foreign Ministry said that it should be clarified 
whether 
or not the spectrum analyzers claimed to have been exported by 
Japanese companies are items regulated by the Coordinating 
Committee for Multilateral Export Controls [Cocom], and that it 
could be possible that North Korea imported them as simple 
electronic products and used them as missile parts and ordered 
the embassy in Japan to investigate the truth.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: ``The Criminal Act of Even </F>
Inflicting the Disaster of Chemical Weapons''] 
  [Text] According to the 19 December issue of the Nigerian 
paper SUNDAY CHAMPION, the United States and South Korean 
puppets are accelerating the chemical war preparations. The 
paper exposed that the United States used germ and chemical 
weapons in the Korean and Vietnam wars, and even brought in a 
large amount of chemical weapons to South Korea after the Korean 
war, and that the South Korean puppets are preparing for a 
chemical war by reserving a large amount of chemical weapons 
under the protection of the United States. 
  The paper pointed out that recently the South Korean puppets 
decided to produce chemical weapons in a meeting of so-called 
related authorities and to submit it to the National Assembly. 
The paper also exposed that the South Korean puppets presently 
possess some 12 chemical weapons plants and have a deposit of 
over 25,000 chemical weapons. 
  This means that the South Korean puppets have secretly 
accelerated the preparations for chemical war and is now trying 
to push for such preparations legally and openly. It is an 
intolerable criminal act to drive fellow country men into the 
disaster of chemical weapons in addition to nuclear weapons. 
  As everyone knows, the world's peace-loving people today 
strongly demand the complete abolition of chemical weapons, 
together with nuclear weapons, which are mass lethal weapons. 
Chemical weapons which kill and injure people with toxic 
chemicals have been branded as the cruelest massacre weapon and 
their use and development are banned by international agreement. 
  Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets have produced and 
stored chemical weapons for a long time. There are some 40 
underground nuclear and chemical weapons storage facilities in 
the areas near Mt. Kyeryong in South Chungchong Province and 
Suwon in Kyonggi Province. Even numerous ion chemical weapons, 
which are known as the most vicious and cruelest of mass lethal 
weapons, are stored there. 
  Prattling about the possession of independent chemical 
warfare capabilities, the former South Korean dictators built 
more than 10 toxic gas plants in South Korea and produced 
numerous chemical weapons. 
  The rascals brought in from the United States numerous 
military aircraft capable of dropping chemical bombs, and 155mm 
and 203mm guns which are capable of using them. The puppet army 
units have been operating chemical, biological, and radiological 
warfare schools for a long time to train chemical warfare 
specialists. 
  The South Korean puppets also staged systematic chemical war 
exercises in collaboration with foreign forces. The fact that 
new chemical warfare equipment was deployed in the Team Spirit 
joint military exercise and that units specialized in chemical 
warfare training participated is one of the examples. 
  Reporting on the true aspects of chemical war exercise 
staged 
during the Team Spirit joint military exercise, a South Korean 
broadcast revealed that in a chemical war exercise, a stimulated 
North area was wiped out by attacks by aircraft and by dropping 
smoke bombs, chemical bombs, germ bombs, and even drumming bombs 
so that no creature could survive. 
  These facts prove that the South Korean puppets have 
accelerated chemical war preparations for a long time. What 
cannot be overlooked is that the South Korean puppets are 
bragging about someone's development of biological weapons while 
scheming a chemical war against fellow countrymen. This is a 
scheme designed to legalize the chemical war maneuvers, which 
the rascals pushed for in such a manner as to lay blame on us, 
and to openly accelerate such maneuvers. 
  By spreading groundless rumors about us, the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique openly announced that it decided to possess 
chemical weapons. This clearly shows how intentionally it is 
maneuvering to possess chemical weapons legally, not in a 
concealed manner, and to openly accelerate chemical war 
preparations. 
  The puppet clique's past criminal acts were so enormous that 
it is impossible to conceal its chemical war maneuvers in such a 
manner as to reverse black and white. Kim Yong-sam, the puppet 
traitor who bragged that any foreign force could not be better 
than fellow countrymen in the beginning of his regime, is openly 
talking gibberish about possession of chemical weapons while 
stressing that one should foster strength. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, which put out the signboard 
of civilian government, is attempting to inflict disaster of 
chemical weapons in addition to nuclear calamities on fellow 
countrymen together with outside forces. Thus, its filthy shape 
as ugly national traitor, murderer, and warmonger, has been 
exposed once again. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, which turned down fellow 
countrymen's peace proposal and is dreaming of nuclear and 
chemical war, cannot avoid stern punishment by the nation. The 
Kim Yong-sam clique should look straight at the rushing flow of 
all fellow countrymen toward peace and reunification and should 
act with discretion. It should stop reckless war maneuvers and 
step down from power without delay.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 9 (YONHAP) -- Visiting Japanese Deputy 
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata formally 
proposed to North Korea here on Sunday [9 January] that the two 
countries resume their normalization talks suspended since 
November 1992. 
  In a press conference at the end of his two-day visit to 
China, Hata said, ``Japan hopes to resume the normalization 
talks at an early date.'' 
  The Japanese minister said that he discussed this offer 
during his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, 
who he said welcomed it. 
  Western sources here said unofficial contacts had already 
begun between the Japanese and North Korean Embassies in Beijing 
on matters related to resuming the normalization talks. 
  They said Japan first expressed their willingness to resume 
the talks to the North Korean Embassy in Beijing toward the 
close of last year. 
  ``The time of the resumption of the talks could possibly be 
either next month or March,'' one of the sources said. 
  Regarding the North Korean nuclear issues, Minister Hata 
said 
Japan and China agreed that the recent substantial progress in 
U.S.- North Korea contacts was a welcome development. 
  Hata added he believes North Korea would not resort to any 
careless acts inasmuch as their nuclear question is directly 
linked to peace and stability in the whole region of Northeast 
Asia let alone the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 28 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata pledged Tuesday (28 December) to monitor the reported 
outflow of Japanese high technology and an estimated 200 billion 
yen annually in remittances from Korean residents in Japan to 
North Korea. 
  ``I am determined to watch these reported outflows,'' Hata 
told a luncheon meeting at the Japan National Press Club. 
  Hata said he is concerned about statements by a North Korean 
defector that the pro-Pyongyang General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongryun) has systematically shipped 
high-technology products to North Korea. 
  Lim Song son, a first lieutenant in the North Korean 
People's 
Army, defected to South Korea in August. 
  He told a Japanese think tank in November that Chongryun has 
circumvented Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export 
Control (COCOM) regulations by clandestinely shipping 
military-related communications equipment, computer microchips 
and other high-tech products to Pyongyang. 
  Hata said he has been informed by government officials that 
the cabinet information research office estimated the annual 
outflow of money from Japan to North Korea at 200 billion yen. 
  The estimate apparently includes Chongryun's banking 
remittances to the North Korean Government, cash gifts from 
Korean residents in Japan to their relatives in North Korea and 
the value of various manufacturing plant-related investment, 
according to Katsumi Sato, director of the Modern Korean 
Institute. 
  Hata said, however, that the government faces difficulties 
in 
obtaining accurate data about the remittances and in confirming 
the alleged COCOM violations by Chongryun. 
  He ruled out applying an immediate economic sanctions to 
halt 
the alleged shipments. 
  Japan will not take the initiative of imposing economic 
sanctions on North Korea before the UN Security Council adopts a 
resolution calling for sanctions, he said. 
  North Korea could ``erupt violently'' if Japan put pressure 
on Pyongyang, he said. 
  Hata stressed that Japan and Asian countries need the 
presence of U.S. troops on Japanese soil as there are still 
``some countries armed with nuclear weapons'' in this area of 
the world. 
  ``We would face trouble if a vacuum was created in Asia 
following the withdrawal of U.S. Troops,'' he said. 
  ``My ideas are not very different from those of Liberal 
Democratic Party President Yohei Kono,'' who recently voiced 
concern about a possible negative security impact following the 
withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the Philippines.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials published in Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 28 
December on the significance of UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's recent visit to Pyongyang on the nuclear issue. 
  The conservative Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean on page 3 
carries a 1,000-word editorial entitled ``Butrus-Ghali and 
Dissolution of the UN Command.'' 
  Noting the ineffective result of his visit to Pyongyang on 
the North Korean nuclear issue, the editorial reported: ``We 
hope UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, who has been to the 
North and South, will pay special attention to future 
North-South relations, including the nuclear issue, and consider 
those involved in his approach to the settlement of the issue. 
Kim Il-song, a North Korean man of absolute power, is 
decisively important in resolving the nuclear issue. Many 
figures who have met Kim Il-song said, however, that he was not 
likely to be well aware of the seriousness of the nuclear issue. 
Therefore, it is important to inform Kim Il- song of the 
seriousness of the nuclear issue. This can be effective when he 
has a heart-to-heart talk with Kim Il-song.'' Referring to the 
importance of the UN secretary general's role in the settlement 
of the nuclear issue and the need for his frequent visits to 
North Korea to achieve this, the editorial reported: ``We paid 
attention to his remarks that the UN Command will be dissolved 
if peace is achieved on the Korean peninsula. We expect peace 
to be achieved on the Korean peninsula so there will not be a 
need for the UN Command. The UN Forces exist as a last resort to 
prevent events that run counter to peace from taking place.'' 
  The moderate Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean carries on page 3 a 
800-word editorial entitled ``The Result of UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali's Visit to North Korea.'' Referring to North 
Korea's refusal of UN mediation in the settlement of the nuclear 
issue, the editorial stressed that ``President Kim Il-song 
clearly said there is no need for the United Nations to mediate 
the nuclear issue because North Korean-U.S. negotiations are now 
under way.'' Noting North Korea's intention to directly hold 
negotiations with the United States regarding the nuclear issue, 
the editorial reported: ``It is the ROK that is directly 
threatened by North Korean nuclear development. Nevertheless, 
North Korea wants to only hold direct talks with the United 
States with the intention of establishing diplomatic 
relations.'' Noting UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's 
proposal for the replacement of the armistice agreement with a 
peace treaty in peacetime on the Korean peninsula, the editorial 
reported: ``For a long time, North Korea has been calling on 
the United States to replace the armistice agreement with a 
peace treaty, but the North and South have differences as 
parties to the conclusion of the peace treaty. The North and 
South must be parties to the conclusion of the peace treaty.'' 
The editorial urges North Korea to show a positive attitude 
toward the international climate for the settlement of the 
nuclear issue. 
  The left-leaning Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean on page 3 
carries a 1,000-word editorial entitled ``The North Korean 
Nuclear Issue--Can We Get Through This Crisis?'' The editorial 
refers to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's visit to North 
Korea as an occasion to ``get through'' the nuclear issue 
crisis, reporting that ``in his meeting with Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali on 25 December, North Korean President Kim Il-song 
assessed that there are positive signs in the ongoing North 
Korean-U.S. negotiations.'' The editorial urges South Korea to 
persuade North Korea to clearly dissolve the suspicion regarding 
its nuclear development.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] 
  Our party and the Republic Government put forward the 
10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for 
reunification of the country in a bid to lay a foundation for 
national reunification through the united national strength last 
year and has made all efforts to realize the 10-point program. 
  Our 10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for 
reunification of the country reflects the 70 million fellow 
countrymen's noble desire to firmly unite all people as one by 
transcending the difference in ideology, ideas, and systems and 
to achieve the reunification and prosperity of our nation who 
has the long history of half a century. 
  We wanted the South Korean authorities to come out to the 
road of reconciliation and cooperation by responding to our 
10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for 
reunification of the country. We also took the important measure 
for exchanging special envoys of the two sides' top leaders. 
However, the South Korean authorities have ignored our 
magnanimous proposals and all the people's desire for 
reunification. They have taken the road of depending upon 
foreign forces, not the road of national independence; they have 
taken the road to the North-South confrontation, not the road to 
national unity. 
  While frequently conducting large-scale military exercises 
against our Republic, in collusion with outside forces and 
talking about military countermeasures [kunsajok taeung] or an 
international cooperation system under the pretext of our 
nuclear issue, the South Korean authorities are leading 
North-South relations to a dangerous phase. 
  The so-called South Korean civilian regime is only so in 
appearance [houl ppunida], and is actually not different from 
the preceding military dictatorial regime. Anticommunist and 
fascist evil laws have remained as they are in South Korea. The 
South Korean people's desire for independence, democracy, and 
national reunification have not been realized. The South Korean 
people and figures of all strata are saying that they no longer 
have any further expectations of the current South Korean 
regime. This is natural. 
  If I speak of our nuclear issue, which the United States and 
its followers are babbling about, it is because of the 
antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuver which the United States 
has persistently sought. 
  It is the United States that raised the nonexistent nuclear 
issue and brought the nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula 
in actuality, thus threatening us. Therefore, the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula must be resolved through DPRK-U.S. 
talks. Pressure and threat cannot work on us. If the United 
States adheres to such methods, it cannot resolve the issue and 
may drive the situation to a deadlock. The United States should 
look straight at all facts and act with discretion. 
  Under the circumstances in which the DPRK-U.S. joint 
statement was adopted, if the two sides abide by and implement 
the principles which were already reached, the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula can be impartially resolved. 
  There is no change in the principle and line of our party 
and 
the Republic Government for national reunification. We will 
make all efforts to achieve the national reunification by means 
of a confederation based on one nation, one state, two systems, 
and two governments according to the three-point principles of 
independence, peaceful reunification, and the great national 
unity. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Amid the expectation that North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency will resume contacts early 
this week to adjust their positions regarding the nuclear 
inspection, the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs and 
Reunification Committee held a plenary meeting on 10 January to 
discuss the prospects of the North Korean nuclear issue and 
South-North dialogue after listening to a government report on 
the recent trends in North Korea. 
  The following is a report by reporter Han Yong-kyu from the 
National Assembly: 
  [Begin Han recording] [passage omitted covered by 
referent item] In today's report, the National Unification 
Board [NUB] reported that North Korea deployed over 40 camps and 
300 ground-to-air guns near Yongbyon where nuclear facilities 
are located before and after it announced its withdrawal from 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty last year, and that it 
conducted 21 air drills last year. It was also revealed that 
North Korea reinforced and upgraded the branch commands of 
Yanggang, Chagang, and North Hwanghae Provinces to divisions and 
expanded its Scud missile regiment to brigade. 
  The NUB reported that as a part of North Korea's effort to 
strengthen the system for Kim Chong-il's succession, North Korea 
shifted the Public Security Ministry, an intelligence 
organization, to the National Defense Commission, controlled by 
Kim Chong-il, and strengthened its power. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Pusan, Dec. 30 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean man who 
escaped a North Korea-run logging yard in Siberia and arrived in 
South Korea recently, said here on Thursday there are about 
10,000 North Korean loggers in Siberia who he said lead 
``animal-like'' lives due to the lack of daily necessities. 
  Kim Kil-song, 31 of Sinuiju, North Pyong-an Province, told a 
press conference that lately North Korean loggers are forced to 
earn rubles by doing household chores at Russian homes or manual 
work at Russian industries. 
  ``These extra works are at the instructions of Kim Chong-il 
after logging failed to fetch money due to the lack of 
transportation means. But workers have been obliged to 
contribute up to 90 percent of the money they earn in extra work 
to North Korea,'' Kim said. 
  The defector said he escaped Siberia after he learned his 
protest over the compulsory contribution was reported to 
security authorities. 
  He said that after the escape he managed to reach 
Vladivostok 
where he could stealthly board a Pusan-bound Russian freighter 
with the help of a Korean-Chinese there. 
  Kim said North Korea's head logging office is in Khabarovsk, 
which he said controls nine field logging yards in Siberia. 
  Until 1975, prison inmates and those who had just served out 
their terms were shipped to Siberia, he said, adding that 
thereafter, however, ordinary people were recruited because 
prisoners were often involved in troubles. 
  Kim said that during his military service in North Korea, he 
personally took part in digging a tunnel near Kaesong which he 
said was for use in holding nuclear. [sentence as received] 
  ``I heard that they were mining uranium at an uranium mine 
near Pyongsan County, North Hwanghae Province,'' he said. 
  The defector said that also during his active service, Army 
officers used to boast during lectures, ``the United States are 
afraid of us as we have nuclear arms. We even can reject 
nuclear inspections.''

  [Text] The government is planning to establish a nuclear 
control center in preparation for the initiation of simultaneous 
South-North nuclear inspections on related facilities. 
  At the same time, it will push ahead with the export of 
construction, installation and operational technologies for 
nuclear furnaces to Southeast Asia and the development of new 
materials for aircraft. 
  These short- and long-term plans were contained in a 
Chongwadae [presidential offices] report submitted yesterday by 
Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung on his ministry's 
New Year policy programs. 
  According to Kim, South Korea has now emerged as the world's 
10th largest user of nuclear power and it is high time that it 
engages in effective ``nuclear diplomacy.'' 
  Along this line, he said, the ``Nuclear Control Center'' 
will 
be set up under the umbrella of the Korea Atomic Energy Research 
Institute (KAERI) to initiate preparatory measures for 
South-North nuclear inspections. 
  ``In an effort to become more responsible in the application 
of nuclear technology, the center will concentrate on 
formulating new and improved policies,'' Kim explained. 
  In the area of research and development, the minister told 
President Kim Yong-sam that a total of 322.4 billion won will be 
invested into the development of new materials and precision 
chemical technologies. 
  ``One of the main areas of emphasis in research is to 
localize technologies which are critical to the enhancement of 
the international competitiveness of the domestic agricultural 
industry,'' he elaborated. 
  The development of new integrated materials for aircraft 
will 
be tested and put into the commercial market by next year after 
necessary testing procedures are completed. 
  Along with the tangible research, the minister said 221 
billion won will be invested until the year 2010 for the 
introduction of technologies which are on par with those in the 
world's seven most advanced countries. 
  Under the long-term plan, a total of 10 technologies related 
to bioengineering will be developed so as to help the nation 
gain a competitive edge in the international market, Kim 
observed. 
  He said his ministry will also focus on encouraging foreign 
research organizations to open up operations here so as to 
ignite joint research projects with local companies. 
  On the other hand, 40 of the nation's most qualified 
research 
personnel will be dispatched abroad to pick up advanced 
technologies for domestic application. 
  At the university level, the ministry will seek to increase 
the investment in basic sciences from the 7.6 percent last year 
to 12 percent in 1998, introducing such new areas of research as 
space technology. 
  Addressing issues surfacing as a result of the conclusion of 
the Uruguay Round negotiations of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Kim said the financing of research 
projects will be overhauled with particular emphasis on 
intellectual property rights. 
  The minister said a greater portion of the budget will be 
funnelled into the development of environment-related 
technologies such as alternative coolants to chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) to halt further environmental pollution and assist in 
efforts to reverse the damage.

  [Text] Taipei, Dec. 27 (CNA) -- National Defense Minister 
Sun Chen on Monday [27 December] denied a foreign news report 
that the Republic of China [ROC] is among the six countries in 
the world now striving to develop nuclear weapons. 
  The National Broadcasting Corp. of the United States in a 
broadcast Sunday reported that Taiwan, South Korea, Iraq, Iran, 
Libya, and Algeria are sparing no efforts to become members of 
the world's nuclear arms club. 
  ``The report is totally groundless,'' Sun [words indistinct] 
an inquiry at the Legislative Yuan, emphasizing that the ROC has 
no intention to produce nuclear devices. 
  He said the existing nuclear equipment on the island is for 
peaceful purposes, and that the island's three nuclear power 
plants are used solely to satisfy energy requirements here.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Jan (NA) -- The Association of 
State Workers (ATE) announced today that the Economy Ministry's 
idea of privatizing the nuclear plants is a ``disaster'' and 
warned that the initiative will mark the ``end of independent 
nuclear development.'' 
  In a communique, the state workers argue that the 
privatization of the nuclear plants ``would cut the main source 
of income'' of the National Atomic Energy Commission [CNEA] and 
would end the chain of research, development, and production. 
  ``From the technical viewpoint, private capital does not 
offer any guarantees because the simple market law states that 
profit comes before any investment in nuclear safety,'' they 
stated. 
  ATE workers state: ``The CNEA will be reduced to a 
comptroller's office which will merely oversee nuclear safety.'' 
  The communique is signed by ATE Secretary General Victor de 
Gennaro. In it the organization ratifies its position ``in 
defense of a complete CNEA within the framework of the 
Presidency of the Republic and at the service of national 
interests.''

<F P=106> [From the Notes and Information Page: ``A Senate </F>
Responsibility''] 
  [Text] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee must urgently 
explain to the nation why it is keeping the Quadripartite 
Agreement on the back burner. This agreement establishes a 
series of safeguards for Argentine and Brazilian nuclear 
activities. The least that can be expected is that there are 
grave enough reasons -- which must be publicly explained -- to 
justify an omission that will make Brazil subject to the 
affronts normally piled on irresponsible governments. The 
committee is not empowered to hold Brazilian foreign policy 
hostage without clearly explaining the reasons behind such a 
drastic measure. The highest national interest is at stake. The 
silent inspiration of the representatives of false nationalism, 
which also seek to become mentors of the nation's 
representatives, cannot prevail over those interests. 
  The Quadripartite Agreement achieved in a single stroke an 
inspired way of guaranteeing, in the eyes of the international 
community, the peaceful purposes of Brazilian and Argentine 
nuclear programs. It is a powerful instrument to build trust 
between the two signatory countries. It is also worth noting 
that Brazil has for some years suffered a variety of pressures 
to join the Non- Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. It does not do so 
because it believes the NPT is unacceptably discriminatory and 
differentiates between those who have and those who do not have 
nuclear weapons. In view of the progress in the nuclear 
program, the simultaneous increase in international efforts to 
achieve nonproliferation, and faced with the inescapable need to 
raise the level of relations with Argentina, Brazil chose to 
strengthen regional nuclear control instruments as a way to 
guarantee the international community of our peaceful use of the 
atom, and as a way to obtain the required approval to legitimize 
this sensitive area. 
  The country acted on two fronts: First, the 
Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear 
Materials (ABACC) was created and the Quadripartite Agreement 
was negotiated with Argentina, authorizing the ABACC and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to supervise and 
control nuclear activities in the two countries. Second, 
efforts were made to eliminate the obstacles that prevented 
Brazil from accepting the Tlatelolco Treaty. 
  The purpose of this double action was, we repeat, to obtain 
the international community's respect and credibility without 
accepting the costs of the NPT. As a result, Brazil is possibly 
the only country that does not have a nuclear weapon and which 
did not sign the NPT. But in order to earn political profit 
from this -- that is, credibility and respectability -- it is 
necessary for Congress to approve the Quadripartite Agreement. 
If that does not happen we will only encourage the 
international community's general mistrust without a way to 
counteract it. 
  Contrary to what is feared by narrow-minded and perhaps 
well- 
intentioned people, the Quadripartite Agreement does not 
restrict our national sovereignty. Skillfully drafted, it does 
not present obstacles for building a nuclear submarine and it 
protects our autonomously obtained industrial and technological 
achievements. The supplementary arrangements introduced into the 
Agreement -- which originally raised doubts because of the scope 
of regulations that could have gone beyond what was established 
in the main body of the agreement -- were finally accepted in 
the record time of two negotiating sessions, as a demonstration 
that the IAEA has great political interest to see this 
Quadripartite Agreement entering into effect quickly. 
  The Brazilian Government thinks likewise. The Senate must 
approve the agreement before Brazil can join the Organization to 
Ban Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Opanal), the agency 
responsible for the implementation of the Tlatelolco Treaty. 
The Opanal meeting scheduled for 7 December was postponed until 
19 January at the request of the Brazilian Government. Opanal 
directors expect that Brazil, Argentina, and Chile -- countries 
that reviewed their positions on the Tlatelolco Treaty -- will 
formally join the organization by that date. For Brazil, 
joining Opanal now will mean influencing -- as the country with 
the region's most complete nuclear program -- the organization's 
working agenda that will be elaborated in January. From a 
broader point of view, approval of the agreement will be 
evidence of the respect Brazil has for joint efforts with the 
Argentine and Chilean Foreign Ministries on this extremely 
sensitive issue. By not joining, however, we will be ridiculed 
for unnecessarily delaying the meeting. Brazil will also pay 
the political price of showing, before the international 
community, that the government is incapable of approving the 
Quadripartite Agreement on time. 
  Congress has been convened for a special session and could 
discuss international agreements and treaties as well as the 
specific item on the agenda. There are, therefore, ways for the 
Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate plenum to approve the 
text of the agreement before 19 January. To fail to do so will 
hurt the Brazilian image in the world.

  [Text] The Chilean Government has become a full member of 
the Tlatelolco Treaty that proscribes nuclear weapons in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. Ambassador Carlos Portales signed the 
document for the president of the Republic. 
  The Chilean Government also has joined the organization 
supervising the treaty -- the Organization to Ban Nuclear 
Weapons in Latin America, OPANAL. The ceremony took place in 
Mexico City. Argentina joined the treaty during the same 
ceremony. 
  Portales said on the occasion that Chile emphasizes its 
complete renunciation and repudiation of the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, adding that the country will 
contribute with initiatives seeking to prevent the proliferation 
of these types of weapons. 
  Chile ratified the Tlatelolco Treaty in October 1974, seven 
years after signing it. Its implementation, however, was 
suspended because Chile considered that all countries with 
nuclear programs in the region had to become an effective part 
of the agreement.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Sardar Asif's Timely Warning''] </F>
  [Text] The South Asian region continues to be haunted by 
danger and difficulties, as there is no sign of a resolution to 
the main dispute between Pakistan and India -- the Kashmir 
issue. A new round of bilateral talks was recently held after a 
lapse of more than a year. The talks failed, however, due to 
India's refusal to budge even an inch from its earlier position. 
Some U.S. Government spokesmen -- especially Joseph P. Hoar, 
commander-in-chief of the Central Command -- are giving the 
impression that the talks did not fail and that there has been 
considerable progress, but a review of the statements of 
Pakistani and Indian spokesmen would hardly convince a person to 
share U.S. optimism. The general impression is that the 2-3 
January talks remained abortive. This means the black cloud of 
tension is still hovering over the Indian subcontinent. 
  Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali rightly 
told 
his hosts in Tashkent that the Indian subcontinent and South 
Asia are facing great danger. He is also correct in saying that 
if the Kashmir dispute is not settled in accordance with the 
principles of justice and the UN resolutions, then war might 
erupt again between the two countries. If this happens, God 
forbid, the war might become nuclear. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali's 
statement could never be called an exaggeration. Observers of 
history and relations between the two countries know they have 
already fought three wars; Kashmir was the main dispute in all 
of them. Since the last war in 1971, the two countries have 
achieved nuclear capability. India openly carried out a nuclear 
explosion. Pakistan has not carried out such an explosion, but 
it acknowledges that it has the ability to make a nuclear weapon. 
  It is true that Pakistan has not manufactured a nuclear 
weapon, nor does it intend to do so. But if war erupts and it 
finds out that its opponent has a nuclear weapon, then Pakistan 
might take any step to defend itself. We know that on more than 
one occasion the two countries have come to the brink of war 
because of Indian military exercises; in these cases some 
foreign circles saw a real danger of nuclear war. Given the 
situation, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali's expression of apprehension 
about a nuclear war cannot be called an exaggeration or an 
unfounded product of imagination. 
  There is a real risk of nuclear war that not only threatens 
peace in South Asia, but in the whole world. The only way to 
avoid such a danger is to strike at the root cause of tension 
between the two countries -- the well-known Kashmir dispute. 
The world powers, especially the United States, should put all 
their weight behind resolving the Kashmir issue if they want to 
save the Indian subcontinent from devastation and nuclear war. 
The danger signal given by Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali is not without 
its causes. He has informed the world in a timely manner of a 
possible danger; prudence dictates that serious efforts be made 
to deal with the situation before we miss the chance. It is not 
inappropriate to hope that the United Nations, the United 
States, the European countries, the Islamic Conference 
Organization, the PRC, and other Asian countries realize their 
responsibility in maintaining peace in this area and make 
wholehearted efforts to convince India to see reason. Pakistan 
has repeatedly conveyed its readiness to accept and implement 
any fair and reasonable proposal on Kashmir. Now it is up to 
India to realize its responsibilities and make sincere efforts 
to implement them. It will benefit the subcontinent and the two 
countries as well.

  [Text] India today dismissed as motivated Pakistan's threat 
of a nuclear war in South Asia if the Kashmir issue is not 
resolved peacefully. Responding to queries from newsmen on 
Pakistan foreign minister's statement in Uzbekistan, an External 
Affairs Ministry spokesman said in New Delhi that Islamabad has 
only one-point agenda. Its repeated stand on Kashmir issue is 
also well-known. He said on the other hand, India's position on 
the issue is crystal clear. Responding to a question, he said 
India is always open for negotiations to resolve all the 
outstanding disputes with Pakistan.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali arrived in 
Kazakhstan's capital of Almaty yesterday on the last leg of his 
weeklong official visit to three Central Asian states. He was 
received at the airport by Kazakh Foreign Minister Suleymenov 
and other senior officials. During a brief discussion with the 
Kazakh foreign minister at the airport, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali 
said ties between Kazakhstan and Pakistan will always be 
friendly and stable. He said Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto 
attaches great importance to ties with Central Asian states. 
  Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said the Kashmir 
problem is the most important issue between Pakistan and India 
and its resolution is essential to improving the security 
environment in South Asia. Refuting a REUTER report which 
stated the Pakistan foreign minister's warning that a nuclear 
war could break out in South Asia if the Kashmir issue is not 
resolved, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said a number of countries have 
expressed concern over the threat of war between Pakistan and 
India on the issue. He said in categorical terms that Pakistan 
wants a peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. 
With the same desire, Pakistan got ready to hold talks with 
India on every aspect of the dispute. He said to make the talks 
meaningful, it is essential that human rights violations be 
halted in occupied Kashmir, and that India, with due 
seriousness, should display its political determination to solve 
this issue.

  [Text] The Youth Congress-I workers today courted arrest 
near the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi protesting 
against the reported statement of the Pakistani foreign minister 
that a nuclear war may engulf South Asia if India-Pakistan 
territorial dispute remains unresolved. A memorandum submitted 
to a representative of the high commission said the best way to 
resolve the dispute over Kashmir is through direct discussions 
between the governments of India and Pakistan as envisaged under 
the Simla Agreement. The Youth Congress-I also urged Pakistan 
to refrain from making provocative statements in future if it 
wishes to maintain peace in South Asia. Islamabad should also 
stop interfering in India's internal affairs, the memorandum 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Engineer Muhammad al-Ghamrawi, </F>
minister of state for war production, by Jamal Kamal; place and 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] 
  Kamal: Why is there interest in developing and 
enhancing the war industry when Egypt, the region, and the world 
are embarking on a new stage of peace in which certain 
restrictions are being imposed to control armaments and 
producing countries that monopolize on weapons production are 
calling for restrictions on the transfer of arms production 
technology? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: I have been asked these questions 
many times, even by people working in war production. I always 
answered with another question: Why should the Armed Forces be 
maintained and why should there be a constant call for 
developing and upgrading these forces? 
  If peace is the goal a state seeks to achieve and maintain 
to 
curb political and military tension and therefore provide more 
favorable conditions for best use of its resources to enhance 
the state's strength and enable it to continue its march toward 
progress, there must be a power to protect that peace. A 
general rule in the military, though, says that if you want 
peace you should be ready for war. Whoever advocates peace and 
tries to protect it through his own weakness would be signing 
his own death warrant. It is wrong to think that peace means 
doing away with or reducing the numbers of the armed forces 
because they are no longer needed for pursuing the state's 
national interests. The truth is that the lack of power makes 
the state a prey for ambitious persons and vulnerable to various 
risks at all times. This creates domestic instability and 
directly affects development plans. [passage omitted] 
  Kamal: But there are international calls to 
control armaments and curb the expansion of war production. 
Steps have actually been taken to prevent the export of arms 
production technology. 
  Al-Ghamrawi: What is being said about controlling 
armaments or curbing expansion in military production is meant 
to make the various forms of war production exclusive to a group 
of states that monopolize it and control its prices. 
  The best evidence of this can be found in the fact that the 
major states' arms exports to the Third World in two years alone 
exceeded arms exports for 10 years. Besides, what does armament 
control have to do with developing your military industry, if 
your goal is to satisfy the needs of your Armed Forces and 
develop the equipment they already have? Developing the 
military industry does not mean exporting it or trading in it in 
a way that undermines stability. [passage omitted] 
  Kamal: What is the major goal behind the 
development of the Egyptian military industry? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: The goal is to enhance the ties 
between the Ministry of War Production and the Ministry of 
Defense, which is the main user of military products. In other 
words, we want to provide for the needs of the Armed Forces and 
to link our plan for production to the Armed Forces' armament 
plan. [passage omitted] 
  Kamal: How can Egyptian military production be 
developed while there are restrictions on the transfer of arms 
production technology? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: This is an important issue that forms 
a large part of the new development strategy. This strategy is 
based on a new reading of the actual situation and on developing 
a new vision to cope with that situation. 
  Egypt's moderate policy and its belief in mutual interests 
and interrelation has helped it acquire many technologies 
without fear of abusing them. Egypt succeeded in acquiring the 
latest technologies from the United States, France, and some 
East European states. Our moderation provides us with the 
needed grounds to obtain what we want. 
  As for our vision, it is based on two main factors: 
  1. To utilize what we already have. 
  2. To develop and update what we already have and conduct 
further research. [passage omitted] 
  Kamal: What are the markets for Egyptian weapons 
under the current international competition? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: The Arab and African states. I think 
that with some political effort we can find the best marketing 
formula so that the revenue can be spent on developing the 
weapons. 
  Kamal: Do you think it is possible in the current 
situation in the Arab world to establish an Arab military 
industry? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: I still believe that Arab states have 
many capabilities to cooperate in military industry without 
fear. We are capable of entering the sphere of military 
production with products that meet international levels. 
  Kamal: Why do foreign papers attack the M-1 tank 
factory every now and then? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: The Egyptian factory for the 
production and repair of armored vehicles-which began with the 
production of the U.S. M-1 tank--was a considerable addition to 
the power of Egyptian military production. It is one of the 
most modern military factories built in the world recently. 
Military industries are always questioned and are subjected to 
attacks every now and then. It seems that Egypt's and its 
workers' success in building the factory and absorbing the tank 
manufacturing technology, the peak of military technologies, 
frightens some people. But we will go on with the project 
according to plan. 
  Kamal: But the project will be completed in 1997. 
Does this mean that the production license will be withdrawn 
and the factory closed? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: There is no such thing as withdrawing 
a production license. The hypothetical shelf life of the tank 
is 20 to 25 years. Tanks in general need overhauls, 
maintenance, and development. The M-1 tank we are manufacturing 
is only a developed version of the M-60-A-3. There is also the 
M-1-A-2. Moreover, can anyone take back from you the technology 
you have learned? 
  We started the overhauling of the M-60-A-3 in the factory 
and 
we will start the overhauling of the M-1. We are studying how 
to meet new demands. A joint study is under way with the Armed 
Forces to select an armored combat vehicle to be manufactured in 
the factory. 
  Kamal: Since the 122-mm and 130-mm guns were 
manufactured, the Egyptian artillery factory has not produced 
new pieces of artillery. Why? 
  Al-Ghamrawi: We obtained a license to manufacture 
the 120-mm barrel of the M-1 tank in the artillery factory. 
This is one of the latest technologies in the world and it is 
different from that of ordinary artillery. There is also a 
project to produce the strategic steel needed for the artillery 
industry in the factory. 
  Kamal: Some foreign newspapers once in a while 
report that Egypt is producing chemical weapons. 
  Al-Ghamrawi: We have an established and unchanging 
principle: We do not manufacture any type of chemical weapons. 
We only manufacture the equipment needed to protect ourselves 
against these weapons. 
  Kamal: Some people talk about the need to 
privatize military production. 
  Al-Ghamrawi: Privatizing the war industry is out 
of the question. Like the Armed Forces, war production is one 
of the elements of Egyptian power and national security. If it 
is not possible to buy security from any state, then war 
production cannot be sold. Privatization is unsuitable for war 
production. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Dr. Nabil al-Haziq, director of the Nuclear 
Substances Agency, has disclosed that Egypt is getting ready to 
start uranium production. The disclosure was made at the first 
conference on ``the geology of uranium ore and the means of 
detection and exploration.'' The conference is being held this 
week in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA]. 
  The conference aims to bring together geologists and experts 
in uranium exploration and to assess the recent finds of 
uranium. Recent discoveries have resulted in a haul of 850 tons 
of uranium ore, containing an estimated ratio of 0.1 percent of 
the substance. 
  It is known that Egyptian experts have discovered uranium 
ore 
in three locations: Qattar, situated northwest of al-Ghardaqah; 
al-Musaykat and al-'Ardiyah, situated south of the Safajah-Qina 
road; and Umm Ara, situated southeast of Aswan. 
  The conference, which lasts for a week, is attended by 
Egyptian and foreign geologists as well as IAEA representatives.

  [Text] Bangalore -- India has embarked on a project for the 
development of anti-missile missiles system in the wake of 
reports that Pakistan was acquiring such missiles, Chief of the 
Air Staff Air Chief Marshall S.K. Kaul said on Thursday. 
  Kaul told reporters at the Avia India '93 international air 
show at the Yelahanka Indian Air Force (IAF) base that the 
Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the nodal 
agency for the integrated guided missiles programme (IGMP), had 
already begun working on such a missile. 
  An anti-missile system detects the long range missile fired 
by the enemy and ensures its destruction in mid-air by firing 
another missile. 
  Kaul said, the indigenous missile ``Prithvi'' would first be 
acquired by the Army followed by the IAF, on completion of test 
firing. However, the anti-missile programme would depend on the 
availability of finances in the light of the budgetary cut. ``We 
will have to do some juggling with the available resources.'' 
  Referring to the United States' proposal to repeal the 
Pressler Amendment (which had embargoed supply of arms to 
Pakistan) the Air Chief Marshall noted ``the threat to the 
nation will be viewed in its totality and not only in the light 
of the proposed repeal. We will conduct our own assessment and 
equip ourselves accordingly, whenever there is a need to augment 
our capability.'' 
  The IAF had drawn up a perspective plan covering the 
strategies to be adopted to counter threats to the nation over a 
15 year period. Implementation of such a plan would, however, 
depend on the quantum of funds available with the Government, he 
added. 
  IAF would fully back the indigenous airborne early warning 
(AEW) project. ``Such a system is very expensive and 
complicated, and not many countries have the technological 
expertise. The IAF will support any indigenous venture.'' 
  The indigenous AEW is being developed by the Centre for 
Airborne Systems (CABS) in Bangalore. The AEW has been 
successfully integrated on Avro HS 748 aircraft and test flown. 
  A. P. J. Abdul Kalaam, Scientific Advisor to the Defence 
Ministry, said the country was ready to sell Akash integrated 
ground to air missile systems abroad once the domestic 
commitments were met.

  [Text] The scheduled third trial of the medium-range 
surface-to-surface missile, Agni, has been postponed. The 
test-firing of the country's most sophisticated missile was to 
be carried out today at the interim test range at Chandipur in 
Orissa. Our correspondent, quoting official sources in 
Balasore, reports that the trial was postponed at the last stage 
of the countdown this morning because of some technical snag. 
The exact date of the launching will be notified later.

  [Text] Balasore, Nov. 30--The medium range 
surface-to-surface missile `Prithvi' was launched from the 
interim test range (ITR) at Chandipur-on-sea, 15 km from here, 
today, reports PTI. 
  Official sources said that the indigenously developed 
missile 
with a range of 250 kms was test-fired from a mobile launched at 
12.25 pm. 
  This is the 12th test-fire of `Prithvi' which is programmed 
to hit an island ``Tentuli Chadda'' in the Bay of Bengal. 
  `Prithvi,' the most sophisticated tactical battlefield 
missile, was first test-fired from the rocket launching centre 
at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh in 1988. 
  Official sources said, a series of test termed as `users 
test' would be conducted before the missile is handed over to 
the defence force. 
  Powered by a liquid propellant, Prithvi is one among the 
five 
missiles under the integrated guided missile development 
programme (IGMDP). The missile is now being produced at the 
public sector Bharat Dynamic Limited, Hyderabad and has the 
latest onboard computers as well as an advanced inertia 
navigation system. 
  The three services chiefs, along with DRDO chief Dr A.P.J. 
Abdul Kalam, were present during the launch, reports UNI. 
  Earlier, the Balasore district authorities had declared a 
ten-km radius around the island as a risk zone, and prohibited 
fishermen from approaching the island in their boats and 
trawlers. Four villages around the launching pad were evacuated.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 12, IRNA -- A spokesman for Iran's 
Atomic Energy Organization dismissed as sheer lies an American 
daily report alleging that Iran is after production of nuclear 
weapons and said the hostile move was part of a preplanned U.S. 
plot against the Islamic World. 
  Speakign to IRNA Wednesday, 'Ali Shirzadian strongly denied 
the 'U.S. Today' [as recieved] report on Iran's nuclear 
activities and said Iran is one of the active members of the 
Internaional Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and is faithful to its 
commitments as a signatory to the treaty. 
  He noted that Iran's Atomic Energy Organization was 
committed 
to the principle of nuclear inspection adding that it had a 
clear policy and its activities had been for peaceful purposes. 
  The spokesman further said that due to the Islamic 
republic's 
commitment to the rules, the U.S. hostile propaganda against 
Iran's atomic activities had not least affected the IAEA 
decisions so far. 
  He said that the organization's report to the council of 
governors on Iran's clear atomic policies last fall was a firm 
response to U.S. allegations against the Islamic republic. 
  The IAEA secretary-genaral had said in his report that all 
the sites, buildings and laboratories inspected in Iran were 
devoid of any non-peaceful nuclear activities.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Ban Nuclear Weapons''] </F>
  [Text] United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
has just visited Pyongyang, capital of North Korea. 
  Lately the United States has been pressuring international 
agencies to persuade North Korea to allow inspection of its 
facilities and has even threatened to nuke North Korea if they 
ever built and used one. Butrus-Ghali was on a mission to 
intercede between the U.S. and North Korea. North Korea has not 
accepted the International Atomic Energy Agency's request to 
inspect its facilities and considers its nuclear activitis to be 
peaceful and regards U.S. attempts as bullying moves of 
intimidation. 
  What is unfortunate is that the secretary general of the 
United Nations is putting himself at the disposal of one of its 
members, namely the United States. 
  This is an important and opportune occasion (the birth of 
Jesus Christ); the secretary general should have considered 
other places. For instance, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
cries for intervention of an international body. Butrus-Ghali 
could have visited Serbia to put pressure on Serbs to end the 
genocide and massacre of innocent people. 
  The question of nuclear weapons should worry any 
conscientious individual. Weapons of such destructive powers 
are no toys for any military. Only the United States has used 
this weapon (in World War II). The Islamic Republic of Iran has 
maintained that its nuclear activities are peaceful and 
representatives of international agencies have repeatedly 
confirmed this. 
  Governments with nuclear capability claim to be stable and 
promise to take measures to control its military use. The 
former Soviet Union was such a stable government. When 
President Reagan was shot, the confusion in the White House as 
to ``Who is in control!'' testified to another stable government. 
  Conscientious individuals in the world have been rallying to 
ban nuclear weapons. Iran also believes that since nuclear 
weapons are dangerous and destructive, and that they could get 
out of control and create a world disaster, no country should 
have them.

reported that news coming from the areas under the Iraqi 
regime's control indicate that the regime is hiding its chemical 
weapons in the oil pipes located between al-Fallujah City and

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israel is studying the U.S. President's nuclear 
nonproliferation initiative. Government elements are currently 
discussing the details of the initiative in preparation for the 
formulation of Israel's official position, which will then 
require the approval of Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and 
defense minister. The review is taking into account political 
and technical considerations, such as the international policy 
on the prevention of nuclear proliferation, the U.S. position on 
Israel's nuclear capability, and the future of this issue in the 
era of peace arrangements. 
  Senior government elements said in the past that ``Israel 
has 
no problem with any part of the initiative, and it can live with 
it,'' but divergent opinions have been voiced in internal 
debates, leading to sharp disagreements. 
  Various elements have voiced reservations about Israel's 
joining the Clinton initiative, asserting that Israel should not 
make commitments that will confine its future activities. 
[passage omitted on the Clinton initiative and foreign reports] 
  Senior government elements said that the main problem facing 
Israel's nuclear policy is the renewal of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which Israel refused to sign. 
This treaty, which was first signed in 1968 and went into 
effect in 1970, acknowledges five nuclear states: the United 
States, Russia, Britain, France, and China. Many countries, as 
well as U.S. Administration figures, have urged Israel to sign 
the NPT. The belief in Israel, however, is that the United 
States will not exert pressure to secure Israel's signature to 
the treaty as long as the peace process continues and Israel is 
required to take territorial risks. According to this theory, 
Israel will be able to withstand pressure from the international 
community, but will find it difficult to stand up to direct U.S. 
pressure to join the NPT. 
  In 1969, the U.S. Administration endorsed the understanding 
achieved between President Richard Nixon and Prime Minister 
Golda Meir, and that understanding remains the foundation of 
Israel's nuclear policy.

  [Text] In a step that is no less important than the step 
taken to issue a resolution supporting the process of finding a 
political settlement in the Middle East, the UN General Assembly 
adopted a new resolution supporting the establishment of a 
nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East. This should be 
preceded by a major step: Nuclear countries in the region should 
agree to submit their installations to supervision by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The importance of 
such a step is that it befits the spirit of peaceful settlement 
that is taking root in the region despite the obstacles and 
hindrances it is encountering. It also confirms that nuclear 
superiority naturally contradicts the desire to establish peace 
and stability. 
  It can be said that this resolution contains both implicit 
and explicit support for Egypt's policy on this matter, which is 
based on rejecting violence and superiority, as well as removing 
all weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East. President 
Mubarak has always had a positive call in this field. 
  Despite the fact that the resolution adopted by the UN 
General Assembly was not unanimous, it expressed the desire of 
the world's countries to get rid of all kinds of highly 
destructive weapons. Of course, Israel's stand is believed to 
be the cornerstone in the process of turning this resolution 
into a tangible reality. It is the only state in the region 
that has nuclear reactors and exceptional capability in the 
nuclear field. All international circles believe it is highly 
likely that Israel has nuclear weapons. Its stand is based on 
not allowing any kind of international supervision of its 
installations. This is a regrettable state of affairs that 
contradicts everything Israel sometimes claims regarding its 
commitment to a political settlement of its problems with its 
Arab neighbors. Israel's agreeing to allow the IAEA to inspect 
its installations is crucial to the establishment of peace and 
stability in the region. In addition, such a step would change 
the international resolution into a tangible reality.

  [Text] Pakistan has again categorically stated that its 
nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only and it does not 
possess a nuclear weapon, nor does it intend to manufacture any. 
A Foreign Office spokesman said at a press briefing in Islamabad 
yesterday that Pakistan is firmly committed to the objective of 
nuclear nonproliferation and it will accept any just and 
nondiscriminatory mechanism for nuclear nonproliferation in 
South Asia. He was commenting on a report published in a local 
English daily which misquoted the prime minister's statement. 
The spokesman clarified that the statement as quoted by the 
ASSOCIATED PRESS does not represent Pakistan's policy, nor was 
it part of the statement made by the prime minister.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Pakistan Has Full Capability in Nuclear </F>
Technology''] 
  [Text] The declaration by Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed, chairman of the 
Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, that Pakistan is among the 
few countries in the world that have achieved effective 
capability in all fields of nuclear technology is highly 
reassuring. Pakistan has achieved self-sufficiency in uranium, 
and only locally-processed uranium is being used in nuclear 
power stations. Addressing the inaugural function of the second 
science conference at Aitchison College in Lahore, he disclosed 
that Pakistan is processing uranium by itself and making it 
usable. There are only a few countries that are self-sufficient 
in uranium. Most countries import uranium to meet their 
requirements, but Pakistan does not need to do so because it has 
its own uranium reserves. Uranium is a metallic element that is 
used as fuel in nuclear reactors or for producing energy. 
  Ashfaq Ahmed said that Pakistan has been successfully 
pursuing its nuclear program since 1976, and that Pakistani 
scientists do not receive any external assistance or cooperation 
in this regard. They are fulfilling their scientific duty by 
utilizing their own resources, which is a tremendous scientific 
achievement. Pakistani scientists and technologists have not 
allowed the shortage of funds to impede their work. They have 
built locally several major parts for a nuclear power plant that 
were previously imported, and have not let external impediments 
stand in the way of the smooth operation of their program. 
Pakistan's first nuclear power plant was supplied by Canada 
some 20-22 years ago, but due to international pressure it soon 
stopped supplying uranium, the fuel; heavy water; and spare 
parts. This was a great challenge for Pakistan, which our 
scientists accepted with great dexterity. They succeeded in 
keeping the plant operational by utilizing local resources. 
China is the only country that has provided a 300-kilowatt 
nuclear power plant, now being constructed at Chashma. 
  Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed said that we are capable of building 
nuclear 
power stations. Nuclear energy is indispensable for Pakistan. 
Pakistan has no option but to use nuclear technology to increase 
electricity production, because it cannot meet all of its energy 
requirements by utilizing such conventional energy production 
resources as water, oil, gas, and coal. The country is facing 
the difficulty of power blackouts due to the shortage of 
electricity. 
  The nuclear energy chief said there are 6,550 nuclear 
medicine centers in various countries around the world, of which 
nine are in Pakistan. Several of these centers will be set up 
in the country to help diagnose and treat complicated diseases. 
The private sector will be encouraged to play a role in this 
field as well. He added that nuclear technology is also being 
used in the agricultural field, and 18 new crop varieties have 
been discovered. Ashfaq Ahmed declared that Pakistan's nuclear 
program is solely for peaceful purposes. 
  Nuclear power plants generate 70 percent of the world's 
electricity. France meets 75 percent of its energy requirements 
with nuclear power plants. There are 424 nuclear power reactors 
in the world. Therefore, there is no reason why Pakistan should 
be asked to desist from utilizing nuclear technology to increase 
electricity production, improve health care facilities, and 
boost agricultural production. 
  As far as the question of rolling back the nuclear program 
is 
concerned, it is entirely a political issue, and the nuclear 
scientists have nothing to do with it. The Chashma nuclear 
power plant will start producing electricity in 1997-98. 
Pakistan needs several more similar nuclear power plants. If 
France had not refused to supply the nuclear reprocessing plant 
for enriching uranium, Pakistan would have been able to set up 
nuclear power stations by now. In any case, the country's 
future energy requirements can only be met through the 
establishment of nuclear power plants.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``The Atom, American Concern, and Islamic </F>
Countries''] 
  [Text] The distinguished journal ECONOMIST has disclosed 
that the United States has decided to intensify surveillance of 
nuclear facilities in Muslim countries because of fears about 
the possible proliferation of nuclear arms in Islamic countries 
by the end of this century, and that it will take military 
action against them if they do not desist from making atom 
bombs. Pakistan is the only country in the Islamic world that 
has acquired the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons. 
According to American experts, Iran is making serious efforts 
to manufacture nuclear weapons, but it may take eight to 10 
years to succeed in this task. Besides, the Islamic countries 
are so rich with oil wealth that any one of them may become 
inclined to acquire nuclear weapons. 
  The apprehensions in the minds of the United States and its 
allies reflect their thinking and logic. Pakistan has assured 
the Clinton administration in clear-cut terms that its nuclear 
program is meant only for peaceful energy purposes, that it does 
not have any intention of manufacturing nuclear weapons, and 
that it will adhere very strictly to its policy of not 
transferring nuclear technology to any other country. Despite 
this, the United States is not ready to trust these assurances. 
  Beyond just Pakistan, it is also planning to take to task 
those Muslim countries that may attain nuclear capability within 
eight to 10 years, as well as those with the financial capacity 
to buy such weapons. This clearly shows that to establish world 
supremacy under the new world order, the United States is 
targeting Islamic countries by raising the specter of nuclear 
proliferation. Under one pretext or another, Iraq and Libya 
have already been U.S. targets. Other Islamic countries -- 
especially Pakistan and Iran -- should work out a common 
strategy to foil these American designs.

  [Text] Islamabad -- According to responsible sources, 
Federal Minister Sher Afghan Khan Niazi has made sensational 
revelations to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto about the 
300-megawatt nuclear power plant being constructed with Chinese 
assistance in Chashma. The federal minister informed the prime 
minister that the manner in which the 300-megawatt nuclear power 
plant's monitoring system is being constructed is certainly 
unsafe, and it may cause a Chernobyl-type situation. The 
minister told the prime minister that some changes were made in 
this nuclear power project during the rule of former Prime 
Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, and that the project is now 
being built on the basis of [words indistinct] instead of 
``manufacturing.'' No Pakistani engineers have been involved in 
the construction of the project, and none of the 2,800 unskilled 
workers working on the project is Pakistani. 
  The federal minister also informed the prime minister that 
Japan and the European countries have declined to provide a 
reliable monitoring system for this 300-megawatt nuclear power 
plant. Under these circumstances, the monitoring system will 
have to be built locally. In this manner, the Chashma plant 
will be used as a laboratory to develop this monitoring system 
for the first time. This will be very dangerous and may create a 
situation similar to the one witnessed at the Chernobyl nuclear 
plant.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``Pakistan To Build Nuclear Reactor''] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali has said that 
the United States should either repeal the Pressler Amendment or 
bring India under its purview. South Asia faces a threat from 
India, not Pakistan, which wants to meet its power shortfall by 
utilizing nuclear energy. Pakistan has no other option but to 
build its own nuclear reactor to meet its energy requirements. 
He made these observations while addressing the 23d graduation 
and awards ceremony at the Center for Nuclear Studies. 
  Pakistan is faced with the problem of increasing its power 
output. The existing resources cannot produce an adequate 
amount of electricity to meet the requirements of the 
industrial, agricultural, and trade sectors as well as domestic 
consumers. That is why the country has to cut power 
distribution every year, thereby affecting industrial and 
agricultural production and disrupting people's normal lives. 
Increasing electricity production is essential for Pakistan's 
all-around development. The country's existing thermal and 
hydroelectric power stations are generating electricity at full 
capacity; to produce additional power, Pakistan will have to 
utilize nuclear energy. 
  France is an example for everyone. That country meets most 
of its energy requirements with its nuclear power stations. 
Pakistan can also become self-sufficient in electricity 
production. The nuclear power plant in Karachi has been running 
successfully for the past 20 to 22 years, and the expertise 
gained with this plant can be utilized to operate other nuclear 
power stations. The country can rely on the expertise of 
Pakistani scientists and technical experts to build nuclear 
reactors to generate electricity.

<F P=106> [By Bal Krishna] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 1: Pakistan has accumulated 
sufficient quantity of weapon grade uranium but its nuclear bomb 
programme is facing serious problems as the country is finding 
it hard to procure or develop command and control mechanism to 
trigger and deliver the nuclear device, according to an 
assessment made by nuclear science experts here. 
  The experts say Pakistan might have several hundred kgs of 
weapon grade uranium against the minimum requirement of 15 kg of 
enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb. But the strategic 
effectiveness of the Pakistan's nuclear weapons will ultimately 
depend not so much upon their explosive power as upon the 
indetectability and accuracy of the delivery system. 
  The experts say since Pakistan has successfully produced 
highly enriched uranium, little would apparently stand in the 
way of its manufacturing nuclear arms except the time that would 
be needed to develop command and control mechanism to trigger 
and deliver the nuclear bomb. 
  They say now Pakistan's efforts to obtain nuclear weapons 
have gone beyond its production of highly enriched uranium. It 
has been actively working on nuclear weapons design problems and 
on the explosive triggering mechanisms and delivery system of 
nuclear weapons. 
  Shortly after Pokhran test by India in 1974, the experts 
say, 
Pakistan launched a separate effort to acquire the capability 
for producing highly enriched uranium, the alternative material 
usable for nuclear weapons. 
  The key to this secret endeavour was Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan, a 
Pakistani metallurgical engineer who later became Chief of 
Pakistan's Atomic Energy Agency. From 1972 to 1975, Mr. Khan 
worked in the metallurgical section of a Dutch engineering firm, 
the Physical Dynamics Research Laboratory whose parent company 
was playing a key role in an ultracentrifuge uranium enrichment 
plant under construction in the town of Almelo in the 
Netherlands. The facility was built by the British Dutch-West 
Germany consortium `URENCO' to produce low enriched nuclear 
power plant fuel. 
  The experts say subsequently it was revealed that Mr. Khan 
had gained access both to secret technical data concerning the 
plant's highly classified uranium enrichment process and to 
detailed lists of equipment used in the facility, all of which 
he transferred to Pakistan. 
  Even before Khan had left his post in the Netherlands in 
1975, Pakistani nuclear scientists were using the information he 
had provided to begin purchasing key components for a Pakistani 
ultracentrifuge pilot plant which was later built in the town of 
Sihala, south west of Islamabad. 
  Later, under Khan's direction, Pakistan initiated 
construction of an industrial scale plant at nearby Kahuta with 
thousands of centrifuge units. The experts say later Pakistan 
was able to obtain as much as 100 metric tonnes of uranium 
concentrate popularly known as yellow cake not subject to 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitoring from Libya. 
The material had originally been purchased by Libya from Niger 
and then reexported to Pakistan. 
  They say Pakistan's first nuclear power plant, known as 
Karachi Nuclear Power Project, a 137 megawatt, natural 
uranium/heavy water reactor purchased from Canada, was completed 
in 1972. It was subjected to IAEA inspections and has capacity 
to produce nuclear weapon grade material. 
  After the 1971 Indo-Pak war, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the chief 
architect of Pakistan's nuclear programme, decided to develop 
atomic weapons. Since 1973, the country has been making efforts 
to acquire reprocessing and uranium enrichment technology both 
overtly and covertly and finally it was able to commission fuel 
fabrication plant at Chashma which is not subject to IAEA 
safeguard, the experts say. 
  The experts say this gave Pakistan a source of 
plutonium-bearing spent fuel from which the plutonium could be 
extracted for weapons in the New Labs reprocessing unit (Near 
Rawalpindi) or the Chashma reprocessing plant. 
  Pakistan's principal nuclear research centre is the 
Institute 
of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH). It has 
British-designed reprocessing laboratory with plutonium output 
and useful for training the country's technicians in this 
sensitive field. 
  They say information about Pakistan's uranium deposits is 
rather inconsistent and sometimes even contradictory. The 
country has claimed to have discovered uranium resources in 
Ghazi Khan Thalkot, Azad Kashmir and Cholistan, with an 
estimated total of several hundred tonnes. 
  The experts point out that in light of aid from a 
neighbouring country and Pakistan's years of weapons design 
work, a test may not be necessary for the country to have 
confidence that the nuclear arms will work. There are number of 
other reasons which suggest that Pakistan will refrain from 
declaring that it possesses nuclear arms, the experts added.

  [Text] Port Sudan--Sources from our Sudanese brothers in 
the city of Port Sudan affirm that the area of the Red Sea 
mountain range is currently witnessing a large influx of Iraqi 
experts working under the cover of prospecting for oil, when 
everyone knows that Iraq does not have any technology to dig for 
oil. Specially informed sources in the eastern region affirmed 
that investigations have proven that the Iraqis there are 
experts in missiles, defense systems, radar, and planes. 
  The first post where the Iraqis are stationed is in Madabay 
in Khawr Ashraf and Port Sudan city. This region was more or 
less a marginal station for radar before the coup by the Islamic 
Front. Recently, it has been reinforced with highly developed 
equipment, as well as computers. The region is experiencing 
strict security measures and 24-hour armed patrols roam around 
it. Shepherds and Arab nomads have been completely removed from 
the area within a 60 km circumference. 
  The region of Dalawat on the Red Sea near the city of 
Hala'ib 
also has an Iraqi presence. The identity of the people is 
unknown and strict security measures are also in force. In 
addition, there is a station at the town of It, parallel to the 
city of 'Arus al-Sahaliyah where there are some Iranian elements. 
  Alleged Iraqi experts were also seen in the region of 
Karnakanat on the northern coast of the city of Tawkar. 
  This is a region for prospecting for natural gas. The 
contract of a French company working in this area was terminated. 
  Some armed boats belonging to the Sudanese Navy are also in 
the same region supervised by Iranians. 
  In addition, our sources confirm Iraqis are supervising the 
development of the secret airport in Udrus, west of al-Wihdah 
district, the last district of Port Sudan. This region is 
surrounded by special forces and shock troops to secure the area.

missiles of the 81 deployed in Belarus have been withdrawn from 
this former Soviet state for dismantling in Russia, the 
Belarussian defense ministry said Wednesday. 
  The 27 missiles, whose withdrawal was completed Wednesday, 
came from the strategic Postavi dvision in the north, the head 
of ministry headquarters, General Nikolai Churkin, told AFP. 
  The 54 other missiles still stationed in Belarus, which are 
based with two other divisions, must be withdrawn before the end 
of 1996, according to bilateral accords between Russia and 
Belarus, both signatories of the 1991 START I strategic 
disarmament treaty. 
  Belarus is one of four former Soviet republics with nuclear 
missiles stationed on its territory, in addition to Russia, 
Kazakhstan and Ukraine.

first conveyed to Chisinau in a homemade lead container. And 
only when the definite date of the handover of the uranium to 
the purchaser became known was it delivered to Odessa. 
  The smugglers prepared the operation thoroughly. They agreed 
with members of the crew of a Black Sea Steamship Company vessel 
that the container would be delivered on board shortly before 
the vessel's departure for foreign parts. It was there, in the 
port, that one of the ``businessmen'' was to meet the purchaser. 
This member of the gang was detained on his way to meet his 
client. He was found to be carrying uranium samples in an 
ordinary coffee jar. A search revealed that this courier was 
carrying the genuine certification of an Afghan war veteran and, 
no less, a Hero of the Soviet Union. 
  As of today six people have already been detained. Two are 
Moldovan citizens, four Ukrainian. Most of them are scientific 
research assistants. 
  A search of one apartment uncovered a further 100 kilograms 
of mercury and a few kilograms of rare-earth metals. While this 
search was going on, the owner of all these riches was holding a 
live grenade in his pocket. Fortunately, he did not decide to 
use it. 
  The investigation established that they wanted to sell the 
uranium for U.S. $200,000 (according to rough estimates, the 
price of this consignment of uranium on the world market is 
around $20 million). The purchaser himself was from Siberia. 
But where he planned to deliver the cargo is not yet known. 
There are hopes that criminal investigation officers will 
detain the purchaser too. 
  The ease with which the uranium was delivered in its 
container to the airplane steps [as published] proves that it is 
not for nothing that the West is worried over the illegal export 
from CIS territory not only of the ``brains''--the nuclear 
physicists--but also the raw materials of the nuclear industry.

<F P=106> [Report by Anatoliy Ladin and Oleg Falichev: ``Russian </F>
`Nuclear Umbrella' Under the Kazakh Sun?''] 
  [Text] The talks between the delegations of the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Kazakhstan in Almaty ended on 25 
December. A considerable part of those talks was devoted to 
military problems. 
  On the basis of the results of the meeting the heads of 
governments signed among other things the memorandum ``On Mutual 
Understanding on Questions of Ensuring the Functioning of the 
Baykonur Space Center.'' Commenting on the documents presented 
for signing, Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Council of 
Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation, noted that they 
now make it possible to carry out all work at the space center 
normally and determine the procedure for the shipment across the 
border of the goods necessary for work to be conducted at 
Baykonur. The Russian military contingent is remaining here and 
its daily life and activity will be governed by Russian laws. 
  Viktor Stepanovich also added that the heads of the Russian 
and Kazakhstan governments have been instructed by those states' 
presidents to prepare documents on military and 
military-technical cooperation in January 1994. 
  What does the memorandum say? It is important that it speaks 
not only about the space center but also about the test ranges 
sited on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan and about 
military cooperation. It is envisaged that Russia will use the 
military installations under lease from the Republic of 
Kazakhstan. In this regard the operation of the Baykonur space 
center and the test ranges will be ensured by the Russian 
Government or authorized organs of state administration. The 
Russian military formations supporting these installations are 
stationed on Kazakhstan's territory temporarily. Their status 
will be determined by a separate agreement. 
  During the talks process the heads of the Russian and 
Kazakhstan governments expressed mutual satisfaction at the fact 
that the Republic of Kazakhstan has affiliated to the nuclear 
weapons nonproliferation treaty as a state not possessing 
nuclear weapons. The Russian side has expressed a readiness to 
offer guarantees of safety to Kazakhstan as a nonnuclear weapon 
state together with other depositories of the nuclear weapons 
nonproliferation treaty and at the same time to give military 
assistance if necessary to repulse external aggression and to 
counter other encroachments on the security and territorial 
integrity of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
  The sides recognized the need to begin holding bilateral 
talks on the implementation of the START I treaty and the 
package of Lisbon accords as well as the need to agree a 
timetable in the very near future for the withdrawal of all the 
nuclear warheads in the Republic of Kazakhstan to Russian 
territory. 
  At the talks the sides also examined questions of scrapping 
the strategic offensive weapons stationed in Kazakhstan and to 
reimburse the republic the equivalent value of the fissionable 
materials and components of the nuclear weapons and so forth. 
  As we can see, they relate to the most acute and vital 
problems affecting the life and service of Russian servicemen in 
this republic. The fact that the ice has finally been broken 
here is perhaps the most important outcome of these talks. 
After all, people in uniform, for all their discipline and 
composure, must have clear prospects and guarantees of social 
and legal protection. Here, you would think, there is still 
broad scope for the work of the politicians and lawyers: In 
addition to Baykonur and the ranges there are other Russian 
military units stationed in Kazakhstan. For example, it has 
part of the missile early warning system. Status and the 
conditions for continued presence abroad must be defined for 
these units, too. Meanwhile, unfortunately, all they can do is 
wait and hope.

<F P=106> [Oleg Falichev article: ``View of the Problem. The </F>
President's Eyes and Ears, or How the Missile Attack Early 
Warning System Operates Following the Breakup of the USSR''] 
  [Text] The top-secret missile attack early warning system 
[MAEW] was certainly assigned a special role among the strategic 
deterrence systems developed in the USSR during the Cold War 
years. Why? It provided the president, the country's 
military-political leadership, and the command of the branches 
of the Armed Forces with the information needed to adopt a 
definitive decision regarding the use of nuclear missile forces. 
That is, it can be said to have been in the direct sense of the 
word the eyes and ears of the country's leadership. 
  Today the Cold War is behind us. The Soviet Union does not 
exist. Many over-the-horizon [OTH] tracking stations, the basis 
of the MAEW, have ended up over the border. Lastly the 
geopolitical position of Russia itself has changed. How has all 
this affected the combat readiness of the system and the lives 
and service of the troops? 
  Here were are on the outskirts of Moscow. The trees are 
covered with snow. An outwardly unremarkable building, which 
has so to speak been legendary for many years. This is an MAEW 
command post, and no journalist has set foot inside it in its 
entire existence. 
  Inside the light is dim and the duty shift wear soft 
footwear. There are telephones to the defense minister and the 
chief of the Russian Federation Armed Forces General Staff on 
the duty officer's desk.... Opposite stands a huge panel, the 
size of the screen at Moscow's ``Rossiya'' Movie Theater, 
indicating the operational situation, the movement of space 
objects, and the status and operation of OTH tracking stations 
tracking near-earth space, satellites in near-earth orbit, and 
all launches of carrier missiles that come within the zone of 
visibility.... Figuratively speaking, the key to our strategic 
security is here in this room.... 
  It is here that the alarming inscription suddenly flashes 
from time to time (for training purposes): ``Stand by. Launch. 
Missile Attack.'' Whereupon it gives the launch site, the 
number of missiles, and where they are targeted.... This 
information automatically enters the special ``Krokus'' device 
which is then used to activate the ``nuclear attache case'' held 
by the country's president. At the same time it is accompanied 
by an audio signal, which was said to have irritated M. 
Gorbachev a great deal. This is said to have ended in the 
``Krokus'' being rapidly removed from his office. 
  As for the people stationed at the command post day and 
night 
(the duty officer, the systems analysts, and officers in the 
analytical service...), throughout the Cold War they were 
destined to be the first to learn of the start of the nuclear 
apocalypse. Cynical as it sounds, their job is to anticipate 
nuclear war. 
  Information comes into the multicolored command post panel 
today from eight MAEW stations, five of them located abroad: in 
Ukraine (Mukachevo and Sevastopol), Azerbaijan (Mingechaur), 
Kazakhstan (Balkhash), and Latvia (Skrunde). They are still 
providing information, but what guarantee is there that it will 
not suddenly stop one fine day? 
  The development and creation of OTH MAEW and space 
surveillance radars began in our country in the sixties at the 
USSR Academy of Sciences Radiotechnical Research Institute under 
the leadership of Academician A.L. Mints. The first ``Dnepr'' 
stations were deployed in Kazakhstan and Siberia, forming a 
tight radar barrier 5,000km long ensuring the accurate detection 
and tracking of space objects. During the seventies it proved 
possible to expand the radar field by including stations in the 
polar region, Latvia, and Ukraine. 
  A plan was then developed for total, continuous OTH coverage 
in the missile-vulnerable western, southwestern, southern, and 
northeastern sectors. At the same time work was also under way 
on a fundamentally new phased-array OTH radar station called 
``Daryal''.... 
  As we can see, the system was progressively built in 
missile-vulnerable areas. Needless to say, at the time no one 
thought that the Union would break up and that the radar field 
erected would be bisected by the national borders of sovereign 
states. Or that they would de facto end up under Russia's 
``nuclear umbrella.'' However, now the question is this: Do 
the republics need these services today? And, if so, on what 
terms? If not, what is to be done with the stations? 
  Regrettably these are not idle questions, since there are 
still no clear accords in this sphere or clear prospects. 
Admittedly there is the Treaty on Collective Security signed by 
six CIS states. But ``nothing is forever''.... Remember the 
promises about the unified ruble, economic, and information 
area. What has happened to all that? Is it true that the 
future of these stations and maybe the future of the MAEW is 
today being decided not only in Moscow but also in the CIS 
nation states? 
  ...The Balkhash area, where an MAEW unit is stationed, 
greeted us with cold gusts of wind and snow. A strange building 
like a gigantic hut rose above the wild semidesert. 
  ``Our new `Daryal' looks strange and, you'll agree, 
impressive,'' Colonel G. Kozlyuk, deputy commander for work with 
personnel, broke into my thoughts. ``The only thing is that the 
construction workers and fitters are unable to hand it over. So 
at the moment we are working with a `Dnepr.''' 
  Vast sums of money at the old prices have been invested in 
the station -- around 1 billion rubles. It is a reliable 
radar. It has triple-redundant technological apparatus, several 
independent power sources, and space, radio, and facsimile 
communications.... It provides highly important information 
about ballistic missile launches, identifies objects during the 
booster phase of their flight path, and can instantly compute 
warheads' launch and landing sites as well as their flight 
time.... 
  ``We provided backup for the `Soyuz-Apollo' flight and all 
flights from Baykonur and obtained information on `Ferret' [as 
transliterated], `Columbia,' and the shuttle,'' Colonel N. 
Buchuk, deputy commander for arms, said not without pride. 
  The MAEW has never given a false alarm regarding a missile 
attack (unlike its U.S. counterpart). But the ``Dnepr's'' have 
virtually outlived their service life, working continuously 
throughout this period. 
  It became clear that the almost complete new ``Daryal'' 
station is not at its best. 
  ``Everything is vague now,'' Deputy Chief Designer Yu. 
Konkin, who leads a wretched life here now with an uncertain 
future, told me. ``So it is not surprising if the equipment 
gradually gets neglected....'' 
  Regrettably, signs of this neglect are already striking, to 
whit ``explosive'' old electric cable in the living quarters, 
empty shelves in the military trading store, the boarded-up 
windows of empty apartments, and the lack of clear guarantees 
for the officers that they will be provided with amenities in 
Russia.... Major General Yu. Kabakov, army deputy commander for 
rear services, involuntarily added to the picture by citing the 
following figure: ``Compared with past conditions, supplies to 
our units in neighboring countries have dropped by around 40 
percent, although the tasks have remained the same.'' 
  The various restrictions on the movement of freight and 
property and the confusion over supplies represent another 
barrier. In terms of some categories the unit remains on 
Kazakhstan's payroll, whereas as far as others are concerned it 
has been transferred to the Ural Military District. 
Realistically at the moment the unit doesn't know whether it is 
coming or going. And virtually everything -- from uniform 
badges to pipes -- has to be brought by air from Moscow. You 
can imagine the kind of megabucks this costs, but there is 
evidently no other option at the moment. 
  Needless to say all this cannot fail to affect the people, 
their mood, and ultimately their attitude to their work. 
  It is becoming more and more difficult to get replacements 
for these units from Russia, Colonel Ye. Tokarev, head of the 
army cadre department, thinks. 
  Nonetheless at the moment, we would stress, all this is only 
indirectly affecting the unit's combat readiness. A commission 
from the Center led by Major General V. Pronov, the formation's 
chief of staff, came here to work and pointed to the reliability 
of the whole complex. It investigated a great deal and set a 
great deal to rights, so to speak. The unit received good 
marks, but its status remains unchanged. ``We have no future 
here...,'' one officer told me bluntly. 
  Why is that happening in our country? The people who have to 
``pull'' the strategic installation out of the mire without 
receiving proper pay, in many respects through personal 
initiative and self-restraint, should be rewarded, but they 
``have no future.'' Why did we make such a mess of the 
identical installation in Krasnoyarsk, owing to then Foreign 
Minister E.A. Shevardnadze's, so to speak, tractability and 
under pressure from the Americans, and why are we now turning it 
into...a furniture factory? At a time when the United States 
has not just failed to mothball its long-range tracking radar in 
Greenland but has even modernized it and has absolutely no 
intention of cutting back its other stations. 
  The U.S. BMEWS ballistic missile early warning system is 
established and operating. It comprises three posts on 
Fylingdales Moor (Britain), in Thule (Greenland), and in Clear 
(Alaska), which have been modernized in recent years to enable 
the system to detect missiles at long range. This system uses a 
multifunctional Precision Approach Radar station comprising a 
``Safeguard'' ABM defense system. During the eighties more 
powerful assemblies of the Pave Paws OTH stations were deployed 
on U.S. eastern and western seaboards and southern borders. The 
NORAD command post in Colorado Springs exercises operational 
control of the entire nuclear missile early warning system. 
  There is also a first-echelon tracking missile launches and 
engaged in nuclear burst fix acquisition -- five ``IMEWS-2'' 
artificial earth satellites in orbit at distances of 
30,000-40,000 km. This system still monitors the entire surface 
of our planet, including Russia and the CIS. And in spring 1993 
during the Western European Union's military and scientific 
conference the question was raised of creating a European ABM 
defense system (EUROWISAT) combined with similar U.S. systems. 
Its deployment is scheduled for the year 2005. 
  So the breakup of the Union cannot so far be said to have 
had 
any effect on the MAEW. But there are problems, as we can see. 
Above all, the question of the status of MAEW units abroad needs 
to be resolved most speedily. Regrettably, everything is not as 
easy as we would like. Kazakhstan, for instance, has a bone to 
pick with the Russian military over use of its airspace, 
fulfillment of customs regulations, etc. But that is not the 
main thing. Major General A. Kasymov, chief of the Main Staff 
of the Kazakhstan Armed Forces, gave his view of the problem as 
follows: ``The question of the future of the MAEW unit is in my 
view linked to the question of Kazakhstan's accession to the 
1972 ABM Treaty. We know the Russian Federation's stance: 
People say that Kazakhstan cannot be a party to the treaty 
because it does not have the status of a nuclear state.... But 
this treaty must be reviewed today to take account of the 
opinions of states with elements of the strategic nuclear forces 
stationed on their territory It is therefore necessary to lay 
down new conditions for the creation of the `nuclear club,' 
either on a multilateral basis or on a bilateral basis with 
Russia. And to record these in a corresponding protocol like 
the Lisbon Protocol....'' 
  S. Tyurin, Russian consul in Kazakhstan, is inclined to 
think 
that Russia should be quicker in making up its mind about the 
status of the MAEW military unit in Kazakhstan: ``I am not a 
military man, but I believe that this unit is a very important 
installation, spearheading scientific and technical progress. 
And failure to pay attention to it will cause us a setback just 
like the earlier setback with Baykonur in terms of the space 
program. At the moment -- this is a fact -- the military are 
surviving here as best they can. You cannot describe them as 
occupiers, since their main weapon is radar equipment....'' 
  Everyday material and technical difficulties are a minor 
misfortune. It is their uncertain status that is causing 
discord among the officers and the personnel. The republic has 
after all adopted a law laying downm that anyone who does not 
apply for other citizenship by 1 March automatically becomes a 
citizen of Kazakhstan.... So you can understand their position. 
And, moreover, that of their wives and school-age children, who 
are not particularly enthusiastic about the need for mandatory 
study of the Kazakh language in local schools or about obtaining 
secondary education certificates here. Not to mention the fact 
that there are Kazakhstani security and prosecutor's office 
organs at the garrison.... Colonel General (Retired) Yu. 
Votintsev, one of the people who developed the MAEW system, 
believes that a sorry fate lies in store for these installations 
if the problems are not resolved. ``The outdated `Dnepr' 
stations will be able to operate for another two or three years, 
six years at most, and then the whole Commonwealth will be left 
without some of the most accurate means of detecting attacking 
missiles.'' However, owing to the dismantling of the 
Krasnoyarsk radar a gap has already formed in our OTH tracking 
systems in the northeast of the country. Therefore, logic itself 
suggests that it is necessary to at least preserve what is left. 
  ``The point is that the highly effective system only works 
when it receives information from all OTH tracking stations. It 
would therefore evidently be right for the MAEW to be not a 
national but a supranational system,'' Lieutenant General S. 
Sokolov, MAEW army commander, said. ``But, naturally, with 
other CIS countries taking a shared financial part in running 
it.'' 
  The Main Staff of the Air Defense Troops takes a similar 
view. 
  ``Whether we need this installation or not is not under 
discussion,'' Colonel General V. Smirnov, commander of the 
missile-space defense troops, said. ``But, in order to resolve 
the problems arising there, an agreement is first needed on 
Russian-Kazakhstani military cooperation -- an agreement which 
is not yet in place.'' 
  Well, this would evidently be the optimum solution to the 
very difficult situation that has developed since the breakup of 
the USSR as far as preserving the MAEW installations is 
concerned. It is after all easy to destroy things -- something 
that we have repeatedly seen over the last few years -- but it 
is hard to create them. The MAEW embodied the best achievements 
of many generations' intellectual potential. And, however 
stable the world may be today, it was, is, and remains a crucial 
deterrent against the unleashing of a nuclear missile war. 
  A final point. A session of the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry Collegium was held recently. It analyzed the results 
of the Russian Federation's military cooperation with 
neighboring states and identified tasks for 1994. It was 
stressed that, as a result of joint work on the part of the 
Russian Federation Defense and Foreign Ministries, a 
normative-legal base has by and large been created for 
military-political and military-technical cooperation with the 
republics of the former USSR. It was pointed out at the same 
time that, in view of Russia's strategic interests in this 
sphere, there are still plenty of unresolved questions. 
  It only remains to hope that the necessary decisions on 
strategic arms will not be shelved. After all, the fate of the 
military and their relatives and friends depends on them. And 
ultimately the reliability of Russia's defense itself.

  [Text] Moscow January 17 TASS -- The Russian Defence 
Ministry is financing the building of a multi-purpose 
nuclear-powered submarine at the Sevmaspredpriyatiye Production 
Association, First Deputy Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin told 
journalists today. 
  Kokoshin said that despite financial straits Russia 
continues 
to build ships for its navy in line with the updated naval 
doctrine. 
  Kokoshin stressed that Russia has legitimate interests in 
different parts of the world ocean and needs surface vessels and 
submarines of all kinds to safeguard these interests. He said 
the new multipurpose submarine is designed to support combat 
stability of strategic missile-carrying submarines and execute 
other assignments in the ocean. 
  According to information provided by the naval headquarters 
of Russia, several big ships are to become operative in 1994, 
including the heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser ``Peter the 
Great.''

<F P=106> [From the ``Pacific Ocean'' Program] </F>
  [Text] Folk wisdom says that a promise takes three years to 
keep. Sovetskaya Gavan residents have found this saying to be 
true. A decision was adopted exactly three years ago to withdraw 
nuclear submarines from the Sovetskaya Gavan Bay. This decision 
was adopted by the Pacific Fleet command and by the former 
commander Admiral Khvatov personally, under public pressure. 
However... our correspondent Yevgeniy Chuyev comments on this 
significant date. 
  [Begin recording] Chuyev: Military 
chiefs had promised to begin a gradual withdrawal of the 
dangerous submarines from the teeming waters of the bay by 1991. 
The rest of story proceeded as usual, and the situation just 
dragged on. You might remember an old joke: The important thing 
is not to achieve anything, but to show a readiness to do so; 
after an order is given, the main thing to do is to say: Yes, 
sir! The year 1991 was noted for the turbulent political events 
in our country, and for the August putsch attempts. The year 
1992 saw economic collapse and financial failures of well- 
intentioned schemes, such as the intention to withdraw the 
submarines. As this year was nearing its end, money was finally 
found for the withdrawal of the first submarine. Here is where 
the problem started. As some officers have said, this is how it 
started: A submarine arrived at one of the restricted factories 
of Maritime Kray -- or, to be exact, in one of the Maritime Kray 
units. The moment it arrived they shouted: We cannot accept 
you, there is no place we can put you. In short, the submarine 
was received like a stepdaughter: it was supplied neither 
provisions nor water, and the sailors had to carry their own 
provisions just to survive. Allow me to quote a part of the 
story as told by Captain Third Rank Aleksandr Orlov, who 
witnessed it all first hand. He said: ``People who work at the 
factory are not practical, and the principle of pay before work 
is very well rooted here. It is called early pay nowadays. 
However, even this solves nothing because first, there was no 
[word indistinct] conversion order -- namely, for disarming the 
submarine; second, the floating pier where the submarine was 
supposed to dock was missing; third, the submarine was 
considered to be cruising independently still, and thus had not 
really arrived. Can you believe it? Although they say that the 
situation at the factory has calmed down, the crew still wonders 
about its future.'' 
  The submarine will leave the factory and head to [words 
indistinct], where it will await its turn to be dismantled. 
Considering the fact that the waiting line is very long, it is 
safe to assume that the grueling waiting and ordeal will drag on 
for years. But what about the others? After all, three more 
nuclear submarines remain in Sovetskaya Gavan, and there are 
many more in the Far East region's waters. Undoubtedly, it is 
simpler just to build submarines than to think of a proper way 
to dispose of them. This situation involves ethical issues as 
well as material ones. It is not the sailors' fault if someone 
failed to think of their future. But as for civilians -- people 
like you and me, those who live on the coast -- we should not 
also be forced to carry the burden of nuclear hostages and bad 
planning. The submarines have certainly done no wrong, and 
after faithfully serving the Motherland, they have the right to 
eternal peace without having to undergo the current ordeal and 
tribulation. We have waited patiently for three years, but the 
promise is sticking in our throats. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Vladimir Foshenko video report from Voronezh; from the </F>
``Utro'' program] 
  [Text] The Novovoronezh Atomenergozapchast Association has 
experienced in full the mania for creating gigantic domestic 
industries. Even when the former union was undivided and all 
its nuclear electric power stations [AES] were operating 
normally, insufficient orders could be found to operate the 
plant and its production capacities to the full. The Chernobyl 
catastrophe and the subsequent suspension of construction of new 
AES power units for an unspecified time undermined the already 
shaky economy of the enterprise. [Video shows workers handling 
metal rods and components on a production floor] 
  Today its main output, components for nuclear reactors, 
makes 
up only 22 percent of its overall production volume. The plant 
found itself unable to maintain its enormous auxiliary 
capacities. When this happened three years ago it was decided 
to shift them into independent organizations with their own full 
measure of responsibility and an independent bank account. They 
were told in as many words: So, if you want to survive, here is 
the necessary minimum order from the plant, find the rest of 
your profits yourselves. [video cuts to show Foshenko 
interviewing V. N. Sukhoverkhov, general director of the 
``Atomenergomash'' Production Association] 
  [Begin Sukhoverkhov recording] My main task is 
marketing. I mean looking for orders and markets for the 
products of the enterprises comprising the production 
association, now and in the future. I have absolutely no 
interest in anything concerning the internal operations of these 
enterprises. [end recording; video cuts to show a worker 
handling automobile window glass] 
  So machine tools and equipment not related to the basic 
needs 
of nuclear power engineering appeared on the previously empty 
production floors of the enterprise, which never did reach 
design capacity. A wood processing shop began turning out 
furniture; production started of glass for all types of 
automobiles, including imported ones; a sausage shop, and a shop 
for plastic goods were inaugurated; and a whole plant for 
disposable syringes was built. [video again shows 
Sukhoverkhov] 
  [Begin Sukhoverkhov recording] As far as our 
prospects are concerned, they include the preparing the way for 
the creation of new production facilities. We are seeking to 
attract investors to build these new production facilities. 
[end recording] 
  From a previously unified plant, six production groups were 
formed. They remain, however, a single production mechanism. 
Next year it is planned to double the number of these 
enterprise.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow December 29 TASS -- The Russian Central 
Machine-Building Research Institute has demonstrated a new 
method of destroying chemical weapons today, using conversion 
technologies of the missile and space complex. The method was 
developed in the framework of the state scientific-technical 
programme ``security.'' 
  Member of the Academy of Natural Sciences, A. Panushi, 
pointed out in his report that the new method is based on 
rendering safe super-toxic substances, including chemical 
weapons. This thermal-chemical technology has considerable 
advantages over domestic and foreign technologies based on a 
conventional low-temperature and plasma combustion. The newly 
designed method relies on the principle and instruments used in 
rocket engines. 
  Apart from technologies, the process of the destruction of 
main components of chemical weapons was demonstrated using an 
experimental installation designed by the Central 
Machine-Building Research Institute of the Russian Space Agency. 
A mobile model of this installation makes it possible to 
destroy chemical weapons and other super-toxic substances 
directly in their storage places. 
  Russian minister for the environment, Viktor 
Danilov-Danilyan, and vice-president of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences Konstantin Frolov, who took part in the discussion of 
the new method, pointed out the importance of conducted 
experiments and their prospects both for Russia, the CIS and 
other countries.

  [Text] Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov 
believes Russia has the potential to double its exports of 
military equipment in 1994. In 1993, Russia's arms exports 
amounted to $1.2 billion. The work that has been accomplished 
has laid the foundation for future contracts, for example the 
supply of MiG-29 fighters to Malaysia. New opportunities in 
arms exports are opening up with the setting up of the 
Rosvooruzheniye [Russian Armaments] company. Its task is to 
amalgamate Russia's main exporters in military equipment and to 
coordinate their activities.

  [Text] Sergeyev: [over video of Mayak 
Chemical Combine exterior, interior] Shortly after the 
war, weapons-grade plutonium for the first Soviet atom bomb was 
obtained here at the Mayak Chemical Combine in the secret city 
of Chelyabinsk-65. Over the past 40-plus years more than 
1,000,000 curies of radio-nuclides have accumulated here on the 
industrial site of one of Russia's major defense complexes in 
water reservoirs and special technological storage facilities. 
They present a serious threat not just to the Urals region but 
the whole planet. 
  Academician N.P. Laverov: [vice president of 
the Russian Academy of Sciences, identified by caption] 
This is a very complex problem. There has been nothing like 
this in the history of mankind. There has never been such an 
accumulation of radioactive waste. Therefore any step which is 
taken now demands careful scientific substantiation. 
  Sergeyev: The Russian Government has adopted a 
program for the rehabilitation of the contaminated areas in the 
southern Urals. Scientists have been assigned an important role 
in its implementation. A session of the scientific and 
technical council has been held at Chelyabinsk-65, where 
specialists discussed the results of the steps taken in the year 
that is ending and elaborated tactics for combatting the 
dangerous radio-nuclides for the coming year. [video shows

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Dolinin ``Reportage for This Issue'': ```First </F>
Aid' for Missiles''--first three paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] Hundreds of ballistic missiles ``held'' by the 
Strategic Missile Forces are on alert duty in Russia. Russian 
missilemen also have a headache over the launchers stationed in 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. They have plenty of trouble 
with this whole ``nuclear missile business.'' 
  Missiles, which are packed full of electronics and fuel and 
have nuclear warheads, require constant surveillance and care, 
particularly in the event of the aging and the malfunctions 
which are making themselves felt increasingly clearly today, 
given the meager funding, depleted spare parts, tools, and 
accessories kits, the destroyed collaboration within the former 
Union, the customs obstacles.... 
  In these conditions specialists locally and at the 
operational-technical control center of the Strategic Missile 
Forces, which our correspondent visited, are operating a ``first 
aid'' system. 
  Operational-technical control centers appeared in the 
Strategic Missile Forces High Command and in missile large 
strategic formations and combined units several years ago. They 
proved their viability in auspicious times, and in the present 
times -- with universal shortages -- they have proved simply 
essential. 
  ``Such a center in the Strategic Missile Forces High 
Command,'' Lieutenant General Vladimir Nikitin, deputy commander 
in chief, believes, ``is the eyes and ears of the forces' 
leadership. Here measures are taken to rectify the simplest 
fault in missile hardware and, if necessary, major technical 
decisions are worked out.'' 
  The center itself is housed in small, well-equipped 
premises. 
Nothing here is superfluous. Showing me round his facility, Lt. 
Colonel Mikhail Poludnitsyn, the center's chief, drew attention 
to the alert-duty personnel's posts and the collective 
electronic panel. The latter highlights information on the 
faults which have arisen, down to each individual launcher, 
gives their characteristics, and shows the time of reinstatement 
of ``indisposed'' missiles and protection systems. All this is 
conveyed via a computer link to the display units of chiefs of 
directorates and services. 
  The alert-duty personnel are headed by Col. Yuriy Surnin, 
who 
is assisted by two Alekseys -- Captain Kotlyarevskiy and Senior 
Lt. Klychnikov. Col. Vladimir Bezgreshnov, preparing to take 
Surnin's place, unhurriedly bones up on the situation. 
Engineers are on duty round the clock, being operationally 
subordinate to the Strategic Missile Forces Central Command Post. 
  I asked Surnin to assess the condition of the missile 
armament and hardware over the past 24 hours. 
  ``Twenty launchers (more than half of them outside Russia) 
required prompt [operativnyy] intervention,'' he said. ``On 
one, for example, an instrument has failed.'' On this score he 
reported: Measures have been taken, and the instrument is being 
delivered to the launcher by courier from a store in one of the 
divisions. The alert-duty personnel knew the train's number and 
were monitoring the officer's time of arrival in the unit and 
the hardware's readiness to receive him. 
  ``We strive for stability, operational efficiency, secrecy, 
and continuity in the center's activity,'' Lt. Col. Poludnitsyn 
emphasized. 
  This is achieved not only by constant alert duty but also by 
means of the planning meetings conducted on a daily basis by Lt. 
Gen. Anatoliy Perminov, chief of the Main Directorate for the 
Operation of Missile Armament, and on Saturdays by Lt. Gen. 
Vladimir Nikitin, deputy commander in chief, directly at the 
operational-technical control center 
  Invited to the meetings are leading specialists of main 
directorates and officers of the state technical supervision, 
communications, the motor vehicle service.... Such 
representation has entirely justified itself. This staff of 
professionals resolves all problems. It is only when these fall 
outside the competence of the deputy commander in chief that 
direct application is made to the commander in chief of the 
Strategic Missile Forces himself. 
  The Saturday conference at the center was held in a calm 
working regime, but you could sense the anxiety and inner 
tension of the people gathered there. There are quite a few 
problems in Russia, so it turned out, and things are still more 
difficult in the event of equipment malfunctions in Ukraine. 
There are more malfunctions in just two missile divisions there 
than in all the Missile Forces. Technical decisions on them 
have been worked out in good time, and the Ukrainian side has 
not rejected them; but it cannot implement them. There are not 
the material and financial means or even the fuel to enable the 
routine inspection and maintenance crews to travel to the 
launchers. 
  Problems also arise in the divisions in Kazakhstan. For 
example, instruments intended for the automated systems for the 
protection of nuclear weapons are not allowed through customs. 
Whether they like it or not, the ``technical personnel'' are 
also required to be diplomats and prepare requests to the Main 
Customs Administration. 
  On visiting the operational-technical control center I saw 
for myself that an unwritten law exists among the missilemen: 
Don't leave a missile until a malfunction has been rectified. 
Those on duty in the control center and those who work with a 
wrench directly in a combat position really are like ``first 
aid'' for nuclear missile weapons.

  [Text] Moscow January 5 TASS -- The number of unplanned 
shut-downs of nuclear reactors in Russia has dropped by 50 
percent in 1993 since 1992 when 54 such shut-downs were 
registered, Yevgeniy Ignatenko, vice-president of the concern 
Rosenergoatom, said. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Ignatenko said 
that the number of emergencies caused by human error also 
decreased sharply from 14 in 1992 to six in 1993. 
  He believes this is the result of the implementation of the 
state programme of modernisation of nuclear power plants in 
Russia and re- training their personnel. However, the lack of 
funds to buy necessary spare parts and introduce new 
technologies still remains a serious problem. 
  Ignatenko stressed that last year was very difficult for the 
industry. Nuclear power stations are owed by the consumers 
about 260 billion roubles for 1993. This forces nuclear plants 
to take credits to buy fuel and equipment and pay salaries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Grebenkov, head of the laboratory </F>
of the Institute of Energy Problems at the Belarusian Academy of 
Sciences, by Yevgeniy Rostikov; place and date not given: ``Will 
Waste Dumping Be on the Sun, Too?'' -- first paragraph is 
RESPUBLIKA introduction] 
  [Text] Today, when those in our Republic who suffered so 
much from the ``peaceful atom'' are more and more loudly voicing 
demands for more Belarusian nuclear power stations, the position 
of Vitaliy Trubnikov seems very representative. I am not going 
to discount the contention that the ``risk levels of operating 
nuclear stations is very low.'' This calls for a separate and 
serious discussion. This time, I brought up the issue of 
radioactive waste. Everyone knows where it comes from. 
However, the question is how and where to bury it. I asked 
Aleksandr Grebenkov, head of the laboratory of the Institute of 
Energy Problems at the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, to share 
his opinion on this issue. 
  Grebenkov: Indeed, the problem of radioactive 
waste remains one of the most difficult and expensive issues. 
It first arose during the development and creation of the first 
atomic bomb. In the United States, all wastes, chemicals, and 
even clothes were mixed with concrete in a special laboratory, 
loaded in containers and dumped in the Massachusetts Bay near 
Boston. 
  In the Soviet Union, the attitude was just as neglectful. 
Radioactive wastes were often discarded at unequipped and 
unguarded dump sites. However, as far as I know, there were no 
such sites in our Republic before the Chernobyl catastrophe. 
  Rostikov: And what about the burial ground in 
Minsk? 
  Grebenkov: That's a different matter. The burial 
place in Sosny, established specifically for this purpose, is a 
sophisticated engineering facility equipped with several 
protective barriers. It has been operating for several decades 
now without any problems. The problem is, however, that it is no 
longer large enough. The situation became especially difficult 
after the Chernobyl accident. At first, we shipped all 
Chernobyl-related waste to the scientific and industrial 
amalgamation ``Prypyat'' in Ukraine. Now that our republics 
have become independent states, Ukraine refuses to accept 
``foreign'' radioactive waste. This is why we found ourselves 
confronted with a need to set up our own dump sites -- because 
you cannot consider as dump sites the dustheaps scattered all 
over Homel and Mohylev Oblasts, where bulldozers dig radioactive 
litter into holes covered at best with polyethylene. After some 
time, those holes sag and accumulate water, which can easily 
penetrate into the ground waters. Over the past two years, the 
State Chernobyl Committee has conducted inventories of those 
sites to determine how dangerous they are. 
  Rostikov: But it was the Committee that once 
sanctioned those burial sites. 
  Grebenkov: This was all we could do at that time. 
Some villages needed to be buried. The fires last year showed 
how dangerous the secondary transfer of radiation is. Add to 
this marauding... Also the problem of burying ashes from burning 
radioactive wood and peat, where the concentration of 
radioactive substances is 50 times of that in wood, is acute. 
Silt is another source of radioactivity. No one knows so far 
what to do with it. Water is evaporating, increasing the risk of 
secondary transfer of radiation. 
  Rostikov: Where do you plan to locate stationary 
burial sites? 
  Grebenkov: In several places. One of them is in 
Homel Oblast, near Khatki. They would comply with all 
international standards. 
  Rostikov: What do you know about the construction 
of the burial site at the ``Marlinskiye Hamlets'' military 
firing ground near Stolin? Local residents claim that this will 
be where not only local waste will be buried but also waste from 
atomic stations and CIS and Western nuclear submarines. 
  Grebenkov: This area was heavily contaminated in 
the Chernobyl accident. Since intensive clean-up measures are 
being conducted there at this time, one has to do something with 
the collected radioactive dirt. This burial site will 
efficiently block the spread of radiation throughout the 
Republic. However, this site will, so to say, serve local needs 
-- there could be no talk about any waste from other regions, 
let alone from other countries.

Sinisoo's claim that Russia proposed June 30 as the deadline for 
taking out the fuel. 
  The minister told BNS this is ``a case typical of the 
situation in Estonia where a department does not coordinate its 
activity with others.'' 
  In Tarand's opinion, the Transportation and Communications 
Ministry and the Rescue Service should certainly take part in 
the dismantling of the reactors. 
  Kalev Timberg, the deputy director of the Rescue Service, 
told BNS the service is to secure fire safety during the process 
and deactivation of radioactive substances if an accident 
occurs. Russia hasn't yet submitted to the Rescue Service the 
dismantling blueprints, which complicates the situation, he said. 
  Timberg refused to comment reports that Russian military 
authorities want the Rescue Service to bring to the scene 
equipment able to shoot jets of water to a height of at least 12 
meters. 
  Henno Putnik, the chief specialist of the Estonian 
Meteorology and Hydrology Institute's radiation laboratory, told 
BNS removal of nuclear fuel rods from reactors ``is an operation 
Russian submariners often carry out.'' 
  The dismantling of the entire nuclear reactor complex in 
Paldiski is to take place in the second stage of the operation. 
  Tarand told BNS Finnish and Swedish specialists have offered 
to help Estonia in this.

  [Text] Chisinau, Dec 23 (AFP) -- Five Moldovans were 
arrested as they attempted to enter Romania carrying 1.7 
kilogrammes of pure uranium and two kilogrammes of red mercury 
to be sold on the black market, customs officials said here 
Thursday. 
  The uranium and mercury, originating in Russia, were seized 
by Romanian customs officials as the Moldovans crossed the land 
frontier at Leuseni, and were to be sold on to one or several 
unknown customers, they said. 
  Ukrainian authorities and Black Sea security forces on 
Wednesday arrested six people involved in a plot to smuggle out 
300 grammes of a ``highly radioactive material'' worth one 
million dollars, according to Ukrainian radio monitored by the 
BBC in London. 
  The report did not say where the arrests were made, what 
kind 
of radioactive material was involved, or where it was bound. 
  More than 20 kilogrammes (44 pounds) of red mercury and 20 
containers of cesium have been intercepted this year at the 
frontier between the former Soviet republic of Moldova and the 
culturally similar republic of Romania, where border controls 
for nationals of the two countries have in principle been 
simplified. 
  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, 
smugglers carrying nuclear materials from Russia and other 
former Soviet republics have been arrested in several central 
and eastern European countries.

  [Text] Nuclear weapons, whose shelf life is reaching its 
upper limit, can now pose a threat to Ukraine. Kostyantyn 
Hryshchenko, head of the directorate of control over armaments 
and disarmament of Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
stressed this during a meeting with journalists on 18 January. 
He emphasized that all components necessary for the safe 
storage of nuclear weapons, hydrogen absorbers in particular, 
are manufactured in Russia and until recently were not being 
supplied to Ukraine. Hryshchenko noted that this led to the 
storage of nuclear weapons becoming increasingly unstable. The 
threat was gradually increasing and demanded a resolution. In 
the opinion of the representative from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, after Ukraine's experience with Chernobyl it would be 
extremely irresponsible not to take this situation into account.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the ``Disarmament'' column: </F>
``Ukraine Has Gone Ahead With Abolishing Its Nuclear Potential. 
Has Russian and U.S. Pressure Yielded Results?''] 
  [Text] Recently Ukraine has speeded up the dismantling of 
the nuclear missile potential it has inherited. On 20 December 
Valeriy Shmarov, Ukrainian vice premier in charge of the 
military industrial complex, announced that 17 nuclear SS-24 
missiles (in all there are 46 SS-24's in Ukraine) have been 
taken off alert. Combat nuclear units (more than 100) have been 
taken down from missiles, yet they still remain in silos. 
Before the end of the year Ukraine has promised to dismantle 
warheads from yet another three SS-24 missiles. And in 1994, 
according to Valeriy Shmarov, the remaining SS-24 missiles 
located on Ukraine's territory are to be taken off alert status. 
This, in spite of the fact that back on 11 August Grishchenko, 
head of the Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry's Arms Control 
and Disarmament Department, announced that, in Kiev's opinion, 
the Ukrainian SS-24's do not come under the START I Treaty and 
therefore may legally be kept. 
  The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed that 17 warheads have 
indeed been taken down from SS-24 missiles. In addition, 
according to the Russian Defense Ministry, nuclear units have 
been dismantled from 41 Ukrainian SS-19 missiles (more than 200 
units) while part of the SS-19 missiles have already been taken 
out of their silos for subsequent destruction. Therefore 
approximately one-third of the Ukrainian nuclear missile 
capability has been taken off alert. Clearly the joint 
Russian-U.S. diplomatic and economic pressure has finally 
resulted in appreciable shifts in Kiev's position. A U.S. State 
Department spokesman in Washington welcomed Ukraine's latest 
moves as ``a step in the right direction.'' 
  True, full elimination of all nuclear missile disagreements 
between Moscow and Kiev is still a long way off. Valeriy 
Shmarov said that Russian specialists continue to service the 
nuclear charges located on Ukraine's territory, and described 
the Russian Government statement that such servicing has been 
stopped as ``populist and uncalled for.'' Nonetheless, Colonel 
General Yevgeniy Maslin, chief of the 12th Main Directorate of 
the Russian Defense Ministry (earlier a highly classified branch 
of the Soviet Army whose specialists deal with all matters of 
storage, use, and transportation of nuclear units and are 
generally responsible for all nuclear charges adopted for 
service), assured SEGODNYA's correspondent that ``there are no 
Russian military servicemen from the 12th Directorate in 
Ukraine.'' However, the 43rd Missile Army deployed in Ukraine 
includes former specialists of the 12th Main Directorate who 
have ``stayed'' in Ukraine together with the army and sworn the 
Ukrainian military oath, and can not now be considered Russian 
servicemen. 
  Furthermore, only three defective SS-24 missile warheads 
have 
been delivered to Russian territory and transferred to 
specialists of the Atomic Energy Ministry (former Sredmash). 
The other decomissioned missile nuclear units are so far in 
Ukraine. As before, the 43rd Army's combat unit storage 
facilities remain overloaded in excess of all norms (six to 
eight times, according to the 12th Main Directorate). 
  The question about the form and size of compensation to 
Ukraine for nuclear disarmament also remains open.

<F P=106> [Report by the Press Service of Ukraine's Ministry of </F>
Defense: ``Ukraine's Nuclear Facilities''] 
  [Text] Some foreign mass media continue carrying 
information on the critical state of nuclear facilities located 
on the territory of Ukraine. They make particularly frequent 
references to ``Russian experts,'' officials of the Russian 
Ministry of Defense, and some Russian politicians. 
  Ukraine's minister of defense made a tour of units and 
facilities of strategic rocket troops deployed on the territory 
of Ukraine and visited temporary storage facilities for nuclear 
warheads detached from those missiles that have been taken off 
combat duty for an objective evaluation of their condition. 
  During the trip, Ukraine's Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy 
and 
officials in charge of the condition of nuclear weapons made 
statements for the press. 
  Lieutenant General Volodymyr Mykhtyuk, commander of the 
43d Rocket Army of Strategic Rocket Troops: 
  ``Problems involving maintenance do exist. This is perfectly 
understandable. However, there is no need to lay it on thick. 
The situation at nuclear facilities is fully under control. We 
have all the necessary means for this. Any attempts at drawing 
parallels with Chernobyl or something similar are absolutely 
groundless.'' 
  Lieutenant General Valeriy Vasylyev, commander of the 
Ukrainian Air Force: 
  ``The strategic aviation within the Ukrainian Air Force is 
equipped with nuclear munitions. They are presently reliably 
stored. Even though our aviators also have numerous problems, 
there cannot even be talk about a critical situation. Such 
assertions do not correspond to reality.'' 
  Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, Ukraine's minister of 
defense: 
  ``On the instructions of the president and in accordance 
with 
a special program, we, together with military specialists and 
scientists, visited all the facilities where nuclear weapons are 
stored. Our main task was to obtain objective information on 
the operational status of nuclear warheads and assess the 
quality of their maintenance and storage. We particularly 
wanted to find out what additional measures need to be taken 
locally with regard to such important issues as the security and 
defense of the facilities and protection from fire and 
detonation.'' 
  ``Of course, we have enough problems. Particularly so on the 
eve of negotiations on these issues with the Russian side. In 
the very near future, we plan a meeting with the Russian 
Federation's defense minister [Pavel Grachev]. A whole package 
of documents have been elaborated and will be discussed. It is 
important that both we and Russia show a willingness to 
constructively resolve all problems that are emerging.'' 
  ``Therefore, one should not overdramatize the situation, as 
some journalists and politicians have done. The situation at 
the missile facilities is satisfactory. We are taking 
additional measures to reinforce security, maintain normal 
conditions for storing nuclear warheads, and provide units and 
subunits of strategic troops with everything necessary.''

  [Text] As the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's public 
relations center disclosed on Wednesday, officers of the Black 
Sea regional internal affairs agency and the Odessa (?Bergut) 
elite anti-terrorist formation squad thwarted an attempt to 
smuggle a container with 300 grams of potent alpha, gamma, and 
beta radiation emitters in 60 sealed glass ampoules, which the 
smugglers intended to sell for $1.02 million. The detainees 
include the manager of the [word indistinct] research and 
production association, a broker with the [word indistinct] 
firm, and four persons without definite employment. In addition 
to the above radioactive material, several firearms, 100 kilos 
of mercury, and a lot of document forms were confiscated in the 
raid. A similar raid is reported to have been carried out in 
Chisinau, neighboring Moldova's capital, which also yielded a 
container with 1.5 kilos of radioactive material. A joint 
search is reported underway for the (?hazardous) materials 
shipper.

<F P=106> [Letter by physicist Yuriy Shvaydok, edited by Yana </F>
Moyseyenkova: ``Warning Against Catastrophe Is Not Groundless'' 
-- first paragraph is VECHIRNIY KYYIV introduction] 
  [Text] On 11 December 1993, VECHIRNIY KYYIV published a 
letter by physicist Anatoliy Kovalevskyy under the headline ``Is 
the Explosion of the Containment Bunker Inevitable?'' 
Kovalevskyy warned against a possible explosion at the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant from the accumulation of a 
critical mass of plutonium and uranium in certain parts of the 
reactor. This frightening theory has its peculiarities, because 
the scientist based his calculations on his own research, still 
not acknowledged by official scientific circles. This is why 
Kovalevskyy's attempts to draw attention to his theory were 
ignored. However, if there is even the slightest chance that a 
new accident might occur, the hypothesis should be thoroughly 
examined, the more so since the author of the letter refers to 
analogous research by Japanese scientists. VECHIRNIY KYYIV sees 
its goal as receiving a clear and grounded response from 
representatives of the official scientific community. Today, we 
are publishing the first response, provided by physicist Yuriy 
Shvaydok, manager of the International Institute [as published]. 
  Shvaydok: According to our calculations, there 
should have been another explosion at the Chernobyl plant in May 
1989. I made the calculations along with Candidate of Technical 
Sciences M. Koponenko and radiologist V. Savin. A reaction 
indeed, was launched then; fuel caught fire and the temperature 
increased. However, the concrete plate cooled with liquefied 
nitrogen cracked because of a difference in temperatures and the 
accumulation of a critical mass was postponed. 
  All the arguments furnished by A. Kovalevskyy are correct. 
He claims that the accumulation of uranium and plutonium 
presents a danger. This is correct, but the critical mass of 
plutonium is 14 kilograms and it may take a long time for the 
process to complete. However, the threat presented by americium 
is much more real. One should keep in mind that a huge plate is 
hanging on pieces of wire and pipes inside the containment 
bunker. Its fall would inevitably result in a gigantic dust 
cloud. We cannot rule out that this might bring the mass of 
americium-242 to a critical level. Americium is the material 
used to build neutron bombs. 
  It takes 16 hours for americium-241 to transform into 
americium-242, while its critical mass is just a couple of 
grams. Taking into account the data on accumulation, periods of 
disintegration, and complete decomposition, I have come to the 
conclusion that the final explosion at the Chernobyl plant will 
take place on 22 May 1999. 
  What will be the consequences? The one-kilogram bomb used on 
Hiroshima claimed 100,000 lives. The Chernobyl explosion could 
destroy mankind by initiating a ``chain reaction of reactors,'' 
both in Ukraine and abroad, including nuclear warheads. 
  What should be done with the reactor? There was a suggestion 
to apply the ``green meadow'' method. To the best of my 
knowledge, there is no way to use this method in Chernobyl. The 
idea is a bluff. I think that preference should be given to 
so-called ``membrane technologies.'' Basically, they call for 
the use of flat membranes to equalize the concentration of 
matter in a solution. By using this method, we can interrupt 
the process of building up a critical mass. Following this, we 
may begin the decontamination of the Chernobyl facility.

  [Text] An extensive range of issues associated with the 
ratification of START-1 and the reservations that are listed in 
the Ukrainian Parliament's decree on this problem were discussed 
in Kiev last week. The delegations of the United States headed 
by S. Talbott, ambassador-at-large and special adviser to the 
secretary on the newly independent states, and of Russia headed 
by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs G. Mamedov took part in 
the negotiations. The Ukrainian delegation was headed by Vice 
Prime Minister V. Shmarov. 
  As reported by the Ukrainian Presidential and Cabinet of 
Ministers Press Service, the sides agreed that questions of 
Ukraine's security should be jointly resolved with Russia and 
the United States on questions of the elimination of missiles. 
As reported by the UNIAN press agency, V. Shmarov said that 
particularly good understanding was reached with regard to 
compensation for both tactical nuclear weapons transferred to 
Russia and strategic missiles. The vice prime minister also 
stated that Ukraine had already taken 17 of the most up-to-date 
SS-24 missiles off combat alert. V. Shmarov considers this to 
be a serious step attesting to the fact that our state is 
striving to pursue a nuclear-free policy. 
  The Press Center of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense has not 
confirmed V. Shmarov's information that the deactivating the 
SS-24 missiles has begun. The UNIAN correspondent was told that 
the Ministry of Defense is not authorized to comment upon such 
statements.

statement ``On Proclaiming the Territory of Greater Yalta a 
Nuclear-Free Zone.'' The Yalta Town Council takes upon itself 
an obligation not to allow the installation, deployment, 
maintenance, or storage of nuclear weapons or other radioactive 
materials on its territory. The transit or transportation of 
nuclear components, including the arrival of ships with nuclear 
weapons on board to the port, is forbidden. It was decided to 
establish efficient control over adherence to the nuclear-free 
status. The statement was sent to Ukraine's Supreme Council, to 
the Crimean Supreme Council, and to the committee of the 
International Secretariat ``The Movement of Local Authorities in 
Nuclear-Free Zones'' (Manchester, Great Britain). The deputies 
turned to local organs of power of the Black Sea Region with a 
proposal to support their statement.

  [Text] On 29 December two edicts were issued by the 
president of Ukraine concerning our general internal problems. 
The first one is on measures of physical protection of nuclear 
material and nuclear installations in Ukraine: 
  With the aim of preventing illegal actions in relation to 
nuclear materials and nuclear installations which are used for 
peaceful purposes and with the aim of establishing legal 
principles of their physical protection, I hereby decree: 
  To establish, until the law of Ukraine on the use of nuclear 
energy is adopted, that in the sphere of physical protection of 
nuclear material and nuclear installations the Security Service 
of Ukraine and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine will 
assess the state of affairs with the preservation of nuclear 
material, prevent criminal actions against nuclear material and 
nuclear installations, give recommendations as to the level of 
their physical protection, supervise the observance of these 
recommendations, and search for and retrieve nuclear material if 
lost. 
  The State Committee of Ukraine for Nuclear and Radiation 
Safety, in compliance with the recommendations of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and also the recommendations 
of the Security Service of Ukraine and the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of Ukraine, as issued under Paragraph 2 of this article, 
will approve the norms and rules concerning physical protection 
of nuclear material and nuclear installations and will supervise 
their observance and the state of physical protection. 
  The State Committee of Ukraine for the Use of Nuclear Energy

  [Text] Kiev is now studying the possibility of Ukraine 
joining the Council of Defense Ministers of the Commonwealth 
countries. This was learned from Ivan Bizhan, Ukraine's deputy 
defense minister. 
  As far as the nuclear disarmament problem is concerned, the 
deputy defense minister said that before the end of the year two 
regiments servicing and maintaining SS-12 missiles would be 
deactivated.

<F P=106> [Statement by the All-Ukrainian Political Association </F>
``Ukrainian State Independence'' (DSU): ``The Political 
Philosophy of the DSU'' -- capitalization as published] 
  [Text] The ideology of the DSU is not restricted to the 
interests of a social or party group, stratum, or class, but 
expresses the interests of the nation. The political ideology 
of the DSU is natiocratic [natsiokratychna]. The association 
strives to build a natiocratic state in which the UKRAINIAN 
NATION will be the source of power. 
  Nation is the main concept in the DSU's political 
philosophy. 
The rights and interests of the nation are the main criteria of 
our actions. The government is legitimate when it is guided by 
the interests of the Ukrainian nation. 
  The task of the state is to serve the nation and to be a 
powerful instrument in its political and spiritual 
self-assertion and in its historic activity. The power of the 
Ukrainian nation will also guarantee the rights of every member 
of this great entity. 
  When we say ``nation'' we mean an ``ethnos,'' which controls 
itself and ethnic minorities. For us, the notions ``nation'' 
and ``state'' are inseparable. 
  The WILL, POWER, and GRANDEUR of the NATION is the triad of 
our political philosophy. The national will primarily expresses 
internal aspirations of the ethnos, which has acquired its 
statehood. The category ``power of the nation'' has both 
internal and external political dimensions. Control over itself 
is not the ultimate goal of a nation. A nation strives to 
expand its influence and its power imperatives beyond its own 
territory. A full-fledged national idea cannot remain confined 
to the boundaries of its own state and it expands beyond 
internal national problems. It is characterized by messianic 
aspirations. A nation strives to make its own values and its 
own understanding of the world a legacy of other nations in 
order to sow its seed on the soil of other states. 
  Every developed nation strives to create a civilization and 
include other nations into the sphere of its influence and into 
its sociocultural sphere. 
  A great nation is a nation that has achieved success in all 
spheres of self-expression, played all the roles meant for it by 
BIRTH [Rid], and is capable of teaching the world and 
influencing the course of history. Such a nation is ideal and 
such a nation is majestic [mayestatychna]! 
  We do not conceal our desire to witness Ukraine's world 
grandeur. Yes, we want Ukraine to become a political, economic, 
and cultural superpower. 
  Political power is created by military force. In order to 
become a weighty political factor in history and in order to 
renounce the pernicious principle of neutrality, Ukraine must 
become a military and powerful state. 
  A country that does not want to be pushed to the background 
and that strives to influence historical processes, must be a 
nuclear power. That is why, despite the unprecedented pressure 
exerted upon us by the United States and Russia, Ukraine must 
keep its nuclear weapons. 
  The 21st century will become an epoch of natiocratic 
revolutions. The Western civilization, which is based upon 
liberal democratic (but, in fact, transformed Judaic) values, 
has exhausted its creative potential. The Russian civilization 
is also moving toward a catastrophe. The natiocratic ideas of 
Mykola Mikhnovskyy, Dmytro Dontsov, Mykola Stsiborskyy, and 
Stepan Bandera are victoriously spreading. The sun of the 21st 
century that rises over Ukraine will herald the advent of a 
total natiocratic renaissance to the world.

Selivanov and Boris Zamchinskiy, identified by caption] 
  [Text] [Announcer to camera] An operation to 
thwart the smuggling out of a large batch of radioactive 
materials which, according to the investigative bodies, could be 
used to produce nuclear weapons, has been carried out by 
subunits of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs together 
with Interpol. 
  [Selivanov over video of said operation captioned 
``13.12.1993, Ukraine''] A criminal gang specializing in 
the export of enriched uranium produced at CIS countries' 
nuclear industry facilities was detained during the operation. 
A total of 240 capsules containing 1.5 kg of radioactive 
material were confiscated. 
  Of late law-enforcement bodies are increasingly coming up 
against criminal activities with a clearly pronounced nuclear 
bias. The impression is that the protection of enterprises 
producing nuclear components leaves much to be desired. 
  Lowering of the nuclear safety standards is fraught with the 
most serious consequences in our time. The attempt to smuggle 
out radioactive material which was foiled in Odessa is another 
reminder of the urgent need to adopt prompt interstate measures 
in this area. [video shows footage of operation,

<F P=106> [Interview with S.N. Voronin, chief nuclear and </F>
thermonuclear weapons designer, under the ``Interlocutor of the 
Day'' rubric by Mikhail Rebrov; date, place not given: ``Atomic 
Bombs Are Not for Use in Political Games'' -- first four 
paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Calling Card </H5>
  Stanislav Nikolayevich Voronin was born into a working-class 
family in 1930 in the city of Yaroslavl. After graduating from 
school he went to the Leningrad Ship-Building Institute. He 
began working at the All-Union Experimental Physics Scientific 
Research Institute (Arzamas-16) in 1954 as an engineer-designer 
and was involved in developing and testing nuclear munitions for 
several generations of land-, sea-, and air-launched missiles. 
He has won Lenin and State Prizes. In 1969 he became a deputy 
chief designer. 
  Since 1991 he has been a chief nuclear and thermonuclear 
weapons designer. 
  He is married with two children. 
  Rebrov: Stanislav Nikolayevich, everyone is 
hearing about the future of Ukraine's nuclear weapons today. 
There are very different opinions on this. INTERFAX reports 
that [Ukrainian] President Kravchuk recently said that ``given 
the complex economic situation Ukraine regards nuclear weapons 
not as weapons but as a material asset.'' What comment can you 
make on this statement? 
  Voronin: Some of the chief designers of nuclear 
weapons and munitions -- prominent scientists Yu.B. Khariton, 
Ye.N. Avrorin, Yu.A. Trutnev, and R.I. Ilkayev; directors of 
Russia's Arzamas-16 and Chelyabinsk-70 federal nuclear centers 
V.A. Belugin and V.Z. Nechay; and Ministry of Atomic Energy 
specialists have sent a letter to the citizens and governments 
of Ukraine, Russia, and other countries exposing all the 
trickery over the nuclear weapons and over the question of 
whether they are weapons or commodities.... 
  Rebrov: You recently visited Ukraine, Pervomaysk 
among other places. What is going on there? 
  Voronin: An inspection of the state of the nuclear 
weapons in this and other areas revealed a number of major 
irregularities in the handling of the nuclear munitions. Not 
only as far as their storage is concerned, but also in terms of 
maintenance. What is being done there constitutes a flagrant 
breach of the most basic regulations and norms for handling 
nuclear weapons. You want me to be more specific? OK. Some of 
the warheads have been taken off alert status and cannot be put 
back. That's impossible. Warranty periods [garantiynyye sroki] 
have expired, there are no spare parts, and the servicing 
procedures envisaged by operating instructions are not being 
carried out. This work must be carried out without fail at 
least once every three years. The munitions have been stored in 
a temporary storage facility, that is in places where they 
should only be kept during the servicing procedures. This 
storage facility is jam-packed at the moment. There is no 
proper access to the weapons, nor are there places for technical 
servicing, and consequently there is none of the proper 
supervision. This is all very serious. 
  Rebrov: It has been reported that a rise in 
temperature has been recorded at these storage facilities.... 
  Voronin: Yes, of 1.5-2 degrees. That is 
understandable. Every munition emits heat; plutonium is, after 
all, always hot -- this is not critical. It is something else 
that is frightening: There are lots of weapons in the store, the 
radiation background is rising, and the time that technical 
personnel spend there has to be restricted.... 
  It is always dangerous to stockpile nuclear munitions. And 
if there are flagrant breaches of technical maintenance 
requirements to boot, it is doubly dangerous. Fire, 
explosion.... This is plutonium, after all. A highly dangerous 
material. I won't tell you what could happen if it touches the 
ground. It has a half-life of 24,000 years.... 
  Rebrov: And how long have these munitions been 
there without technical servicing? 
  Voronin: Five years.... The articles contain 
moisture absorbers and bulk fillers [poglotiteli vlagi i 
obyema]. They also require periodic checks. A change in the 
oxygen content of the environment can cause the important 
uranium components to oxidize. These processes occur tens of 
times more intensively than in air.... And there is also the 
formation of fine dust. It can spontaneously ignite. What is 
more, the hydrogen content is rising in the hermetic container. 
It may approach critical level. And an explosive mixture 
spells the danger of detonation. The increased concentration of 
hydrogen also has an adverse effect on electronic instruments. 
  Rebrov: It is not only at Pervomaysk that this 
alarming, if not dangerous, situation has arisen.... 
  Voronin: Regrettably, no. A similar feckless 
attitude is being manifested toward cruise missiles and other 
munitions. The recurrent irregularities are becoming 
frightening. Just think: Missile complexes fitted with nuclear 
munitions are not carrying out the repair and inspection work 
for which documentation makes provision. 
  And what about failure to comply with transportation 
regulations! We asked for two weapons to be sent to us for 
control disassembly [kontrolnaya razborka]. The talks were 
difficult, but it did nonetheless prove possible to persuade 
them of the -- let me stress -- urgent advisability of doing 
this. We are still waiting. The weapons have still not turned 
up. It now turns out that they are held up at customs and have 
spent two weeks in a siding somewhere without any supervision 
and guard. 
  In a word, these violations -- and the list goes on and on 
-- 
are causing slipups, increasing the danger in handling nuclear 
munitions, and may cause accidents whose consequences and scale 
will be comparable to or even exceed the disaster at Chernobyl. 
  And this is a disaster not only for Ukraine and Russia. All 
neighboring states and those states in Europe and the Near East 
which, owing to various meteorological phenomena, may find 
themselves in the zone of radioactive contamination need to 
ponder this. 
  Rebrov: Stanislav Nikolayevich, is Ukraine able in 
your opinion to cope autonomously with such an alarming 
situation and such a complex problem? 
  Voronin: What do you mean by ``cope with?'' The 
rigorous system for maintaining and ensuring the security of 
nuclear weapons that operated for many years in the former USSR 
and is still functioning in Russia has been destroyed in Ukraine 
and is not operational. I say this in all responsibility as a 
chief designer. 
  I do not want to go into the reasons, I do not want to 
conduct a political debate; I am only talking facts. And the 
facts are that the prevailing situation is being aggravated by 
the fact that the nuclear munitions on Ukraine's territory lack 
physical protection and guard in keeping with present-day 
requirements. 
  Rebrov: What about disassembly? The Ukrainian 
leadership is relying on Western aid.... 
  Voronin: Let me tell you this: Atomic bombs are 
not for use in political games! Some politicians are indeed 
saying that nuclear munitions can be dismantled in Ukraine. 
This is an ill-intentioned attempt to mislead the public. 
Ukraine has neither the specialists with the requisite 
qualifications nor the production units nor the experience of 
disassembling weapons. Incidentally, handling munitions whose 
warranty periods have expired and which have been kept in 
extremely dubious conditions is a highly dangerous job. 
  I would like to believe that we will reach a sensible 
solution once we have cast aside all political ambition and 
speculation. In exchange for the warheads Ukraine will receive 
fuel elements for its nuclear electric power stations. But who 
will pay the ``Russian workers'' for their hypercomplex and 
dangerous work? Have you asked yourself that? 
  It is thoughtless to count on foreign specialists. No 
sensible professional, if he is a responsible inhabitant of the 
planet, would undertake to dismantle a nuclear munition 
developed in another country, using unknown technology. 
  Rebrov: What is the situation today? Has there at 
least been some progress -- the problem has, as you said, gone 
beyond Ukraine and Russia? 
  Voronin: There is no particular optimism. 
However, nor is there particular reason not to be optimistic. 
The warheads must be removed immediately. We have proposed a 
schedule. And that is not so easy either. The transport and 
the plants where the disassembly will be carried out must not be 
overloaded. Time is moving on. Haggling is inappropriate in 
such a dangerous situation. There has so far been no reaction 
from Ukraine. 
  Rebrov: Stanislav Nikolayevich, there have been 
various adjustments and amendments to the agreements that have 
been reached.... What is behind them? 
  Voronin: All that is irresponsible bluff. That is 
why scientists and designers from two Russian nuclear centers 
have provided the peoples and governments of all the world's 
countries with an analysis of the situation and urged them to do 
everything they can to avert a potential catastrophe. 
  Rebrov: When we met with you in Arzamas-16 in 
October you spoke about the problem of the safety of the nuclear 
weapons, and now we have this situation.... 
  Voronin: I said and I can repeat that we have not 
been marking time while working on developing nuclear munitions. 
Year in, year out the level of security has risen. We have 
succeeded in developing new detonators that do not explode in 
the event of fire or when struck and do not operate even if you 
crush them. In other words, we have succeeded in making 
detonators less sensitive to heat and mechanical factors than 
the explosives used in the weapons. 
  The configuration and design of these munitions are devised 
in such a way as to ensure that no nuclear explosion occurs in 
the event of any catastrophe or accident. But what I am saying 
does not apply to the munitions now in Ukraine. 
  Rebrov: You said that ``you have not been marking 
time.'' What about now? 
  Voronin: Do you mean: What are we doing now? 
Have we come to a standstill? Have I gotten your drift? Allow 
me to ask you this: Has the world already become nuclear-free, 
and have all states with nuclear weapons stopped producing and 
improving them? No! Then why should Russia act differently? 
Isn't our security guaranteed by the might of the country's 
defense potential? I think that I have answered your question. 
  Rebrov: In that case are tests necessary? 
  Voronin: They are. Can you develop new weapons 
and not test them? I would like to talk about guarantees of the 
safety of such tests. We have developed a technology for 
underground explosions whereby no emissions occur. This is a 
tricky problem, but it has been resolved. And I think that 
information about it should not be kept secret but brought to 
the notice of the public, to everyone who talks about tests 
without knowing or understanding the crux of the matter. 
Regrettably, the inspections that have been carried out at test 
facilities -- not long ago but recently -- have not acted as an 
argument; nobody reads these reports. Hence the tendency to 
blame atomic specialists for everything. 
  Moreover, if we are talking about tests, you have to take a 
far broader view and not just confine yourself to weapons. Talk 
to our scientists and, in particular, to Academicians Khariton 
and Trutnev. Both Yuliy Borisovich and Yuriy Alekseyevich will 
give you a detailed insight into the problems of physical 
science. It is not ``marking time'' either; today physics is 
tackling the kind of processes that cannot be reproduced under 
laboratory conditions. Imagine, pressure of billions of 
atmospheres, temperatures of tens and even hundreds of millions 
of degrees, velocity measured in 100-millionths of a second.... 
Not to mention fantastic densities, the purity of the 
substances obtained, etc. No science can develop without 
experiment.... 
  Rebrov: Blowing up munitions that have been 
uncontrolled in terms of technical servicing, observance of 
storage norms, etc is probably of interest to nuclear designers? 
  Voronin: Indisputably. That is why I would like 
to stress that we should not tilt at windmills but confront the 
real danger. It does exist, and its source is well-known. 
  Rebrov: One last thing, Stanislav Nikolayevich, 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has frequently written about the social tension 
at Arzamas-16. Has there been any change? 
  Voronin: We are grateful for the support, the 
newspaper's article played a positive role, and there has been 
kind of progress, but.... Regrettably everything has been held 
up. And I do not rule out the possibility of another social 
explosion.

<F P=106> [Article by Anatoliy Martsynovskyy: ``Missiles on Target. </F>
Ukrainian Nuclear Weapons Are Among the Main Objectives in 
Moscow's Offensive External Policy'' -- first paragraph 
published in boldface] 
  [Text] It would be naive to believe that our missiles 
constitute a military threat for Russia. These missiles are 
under the operational control of Russia's Strategic Missile 
Troops headquarters; they are serviced by Russian specialists 
alongside Ukrainian ones; our military doctrine does not 
envisage first nuclear strike, and so forth. Notwithstanding 
this, Russia seeks Ukraine's nuclear disarmament as soon as 
possible and the ``missiles issue'' remains a stumbling-block in 
relations between Ukraine and Russia. 
  Moscow is developing vigorous activity. Taking advantage of 
its prestige (more specifically, our lack of prestige) in the 
world, it does everything it can to continue playing the role of 
a big brother who holds the younger brother's hand and keeps 
pointing at him: ``A naughty boy!'' This negative image of 
Ukraine, the image of a minor nuclear aggressor is also steadily 
being created by the Russian mass media, which are readily 
quoted by the West. The world community is being encouraged to 
put pressure upon Ukraine. An appeal was recently issued by 
Russian designers, scientists, and specialists of the Atomic 
Energy Ministry [Minatom] to citizens and governments of world 
states, in which the Russians intimidated those governments with 
the dangerous state of Ukrainian nuclear warheads. All the 
numerous statements by high-ranking Ukrainian politicians and 
military figures on the groundlessness of such assertions do not 
produce any special effect and constitute, figuratively 
speaking, whispers against a background of Russian loudspeakers. 
  Russia's official argument in this political struggle is the 
dangerous state of our missiles. Having pointed out that our 
politicians (people's deputy Serhiy Semenets, co-chairman of the 
group for studying aspects of ratifying START-1: ``Emergency 
Situations Are Impossible'') and military figures (Minister of 
Defense Vitaliy Radetskyy: ``The State of Missile Facilities Is 
Satisfactory'') have a different opinion, we will proceed to 
some other, more spontaneous, methods resorted to by Moscow for 
attaining Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. 
  If Ukraine gets rid of its missiles, Russia will become the 
only nuclear power in the region of Central and Eastern Europe. 
This will also give it the traditional and desired possibility 
to be at the top. The Russian desire to be in control is more 
than obvious: For example, Russia's nervous reaction to plans by 
Poland, Hungary, and Czechia to join NATO was very revealing. 
If such plans are implemented, the alignment of forces promoted 
in the region will not be in Russia's best interests. At a 
recent (1 December 1993) CSCE conference in Rome, Russia 
demanded that the mandate of a peacekeeper in CIS countries be 
given to it -- not a single country supported that initiative. 
Fortunately for us, because that mandate, alongside statements 
by Russian politicians, in particular, Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Andrey Kozyrev (``Russia must actively defend the rights 
of the Russian-speaking population, using rapid- deployment 
forces for the purpose''), would give our neighbors an 
opportunity for large-scale activities, since (again, from 
Moscow's point of view) that ``Russian-speaking population'' is 
abused in almost every former Union republic. Thus, Russia is 
clearly striving to gain control of the region, and Ukrainian 
missiles, which are presently a real factor of deterrence, do 
not in any way suit its ``far-reaching'' plans. 
  Another factor of Russian impatience is totally prosaic -- 
the cost of the content of the Ukrainian warheads. This amounts 
to billions of U.S. dollars. That is why Russia demands that 
the warheads be transferred precisely to it. Kazakhstan, which 
had hitherto been ``quiet,'' played a dirty trick on Moscow: On 
13 December, an American-Kazakhstan agreement was signed -- the 
Americans want to buy the entire uranium content of Kazakhstan's 
missiles. That uranium is worth about $1 billion; therefore, 
this money is flowing under Russia's nose into Kazakhstan's 
treasury. Moscow newspapers immediately called Kazakhstan's 
missiles ``in fact, Russian property'' and regretted that 
Ukraine's uncompromising position is having such a bad influence 
upon Kazakhstan's behavior. Therefore, Russia's striving to get 
hold of Ukrainian warheads is perfectly understandable, as is 
also Moscow's anxiety on this point: There is no agreement 
between Ukraine and Russia on transferring warheads to Russian 
plants. 
  Russia's reaction to our parliament's decree on ratifying 
START-1 was all the more negative. At that time, Moscow 
resembled a furious fisherman looking at yet another empty hook. 
Kozyrev demonstratively refused to receive our Ambassador 
Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy. The aforementioned appeal by Russian 
scientists to the world was quickly arranged. The Moscow press, 
having stopped pouring dirt by buckets, opened all the taps on 
the tank. 
  A few words on the decree itself. It is quite obvious that 
this document cannot be assessed in a simple way. Yes, despite 
previous promises, we have actually become a nuclear power, 
although temporarily so; yes, the decree is at variance with 
some articles of the Lisbon Protocol under which our president's 
signature appears; yes, the document itself, from the point of 
view of politicians, contains rather naive points regarding 
security guarantees for Ukraine. However, it is pointless to 
assert either the wisdom or worthlessness of that document, 
proceeding from immediate considerations alone: Doubtless the 
future, perhaps, not so distant, will provide such an 
assessment. Let me remind you that the deputies almost 
unanimously (what a surprise!) approved the reduction, over 
seven years, of 36 percent of launch vehicles and 42 percent of 
warheads. They [the deputies] advanced conditions to the world: 
Never use nuclear weapons against Ukraine; do not use 
conventional armed forces against it, and do not resort to the 
threat of force; refrain from exerting economic pressure for the 
purpose of resolving any disputes; respect Ukraine's territorial 
integrity and inviolability of borders. By the time the decree 
was adopted, Ukraine had 176 vertical-launch installations with 
1,240 nuclear warheads and 43 heavy bombers with 372 nuclear 
warheads. 
  That the position of the Ukrainian parliament should not be 
characterized in categorically negative terms was soon confirmed 
by the Russian elections in which Zhirinovskiy, a ``sincere 
friend'' of the former imperial colonies, triumphed. 
Anti-Ukrainian articles on nuclear topics immediately 
disappeared from Moscow newspapers (apparently, not for long). 
The world became concerned and a question arose: Is it 
generally safe to transfer the Union's nuclear weapons to 
Russia? At any rate, the warheads of 17 missiles that were 
deactivated by Ukraine at the end of December have remained ``at 
home.'' At other times, this would have given rise to certain 
emotions in Russia. Now, there is complete tranquility. Maybe, 
the United States will also revise its policy with regard to 
Ukraine. So far, it only listened to what Russia was saying. 
  According to [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine 
will continue to adhere to its decision to become a nuclear-free 
state, but we will demand that a tripartite agreement be 
concluded with Russia and the United States. Meanwhile, an 
opinion is being formed among Ukrainian parliamentarians on the 
need for Ukraine to gain full control of its missiles: Such 
control on the part of Russia is dangerous for our country. It 
is significant that there is no nonaggression agreement between 
the two states. Besides, Russia's military doctrine envisages a 
preventive nuclear strike against nuclear countries. 
Technically speaking, according to specialists, it is not a 
major problem for Ukraine to gain positive control over the 
missiles. The problem is, rather, a political one. 
  Without doubt, we are in favor of a nuclear-free world. 
However, at present, a number of political and economic 
considerations prompt us to refrain from hasty steps, such as 
was the proclamation of the country's nuclear-free status at the 
dawn of our independence. At any rate, the fulfillment of the 
parliament's decree has already started, and this is a specific 
step toward a nuclear-free Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Report by George Timmerman; place and date not given: </F>
``Belgian-Walloon Arms Exports: `Business As Usual' -- Trade to 
Gulf States Continues''] 
  [Text] Brussels, 29 Dec -- In a few weeks Foreign Trade 
Minister Robert Urbain [PS: French-speaking wing of the 
Socialist Party] will have to present his report on the Belgian 
arms trade to parliament for the first time. The publication of 
such an annual report is set by the new and stricter arms act of 
5 August 1991, which only came into effect on 16 April 1993. 
The new law, which prohibits arms exports to countries which do 
not respect human rights, was passed under pressure from the SP 
[Dutch-speaking wing of the Socialist Party] and the Volksunie 
[The People's Union]. All signs seem to indicate that despite 
the law, little has changed. The motto for the Walloon-Belgian 
arms manufacturers remains: ``Business as usual.'' 
  The export of murderous weapons is traditionally viewed as a 
very sensitive political issue. It is not just a moral 
question. Since all the large producers of ``classical'' 
weapons are on the other side of the language border [Wallonia], 
it is also a loaded issue in community terms. Reasons enough to 
raise as much fog and secrecy as possible round this aspect of 
our export efforts. 
  On 17 May 1993 Volksunie Senator Nelly Maes asked Minister 
Urbain which countries in North America, the Near and Middle 
East are supplied with arms by Belgium. The answer was: 
``Since the publication of a list of countries which purchased 
arms in Belgium is extremely delicate given the relations with 
these countries, the discussion of this report [on the 
application of the new arms act] with the agreed confidential 
framework offers the opportunity to further break down the 
information into geographical areas.'' 
  In his answer, Urbain also revealed that since the new arms 
act took effect, from 16 April to 15 May, licences were granted 
for the definitive export of weapons, ammunition and materiel 
specially for military usage, to a value of 1,888 billion 
Belgian francs [BFr]. These products were overwhelmingly 
destined for NATO countries (BFr1,542 billion) and countries put 
on the same footing as NATO countries (BFr135 million), he said. 
Other areas appeared to be of secondary importance, according 
to Urbain's figures: the Near East (BFr48 million), Asia 
(BFr114 million), Latin America (BFr29 million), Africa (BFr2 
million) and Eastern Europe (BFr15 million). 
<H5>  Double? </H5>
  However, reliable and fairly detailed information in the 
possession of the editorial office, drawn up by the Customs and 
Excise Administration of the Finance Ministry, point in another 
direction. This information mainly covers the period just 
before the new arms act took effect (January 1991 to July 1993). 
Of course the large and apparently very urgent arms deliveries 
to Turkey by plane from Zaventem fall under sales to NATO 
partners. However, a civil war is clearly taking place in 
Turkey, so that arms exports to it were prohibited under the old 
law too. In addition very large weapons consignments were 
transported by ship from Antwerp and Zeebrugge to Saudi Arabia 
and other Gulf States, such as Qatar, Oman and the United Arab 
Emirates. Has this enormous trade to the Gulf States suddenly 
dried up since the new arms act took effect? Since the middle 
of April this year all licence applications have been examined 
in the light of the provisions of the new arms export act, 
according to minister Urbain. All-in-all, in the first month 
since the new law took effect, ``one export application was 
refused, because the destination was obviously violating human 
rights.'' In any case the amount quoted by Urbain of BFr1.8 
billion in one month seems strikingly large. By way of 
comparison: Foreign Affairs Minister Willy Claes (SP), in 
answer to a parliamentary question in the past, said that 
Belgian arms exports stood at BFr11.5 billion in 1991. If the 
period under examination of mid-April to mid-May 1993 is 
representative of the whole year, then in the course of this 
year arms exports would have climbed to BFr21.6 billion. That is 
nearly double the amount compaired to two years ago. 
<H5>  Outdated </H5>
  There was a time gap of no less that 18 months between the 
passing of the arms trade act by parliament and the publication 
of the implementation decrees in the Official Journal. During 
all this time the new arms act was in a dead letterbox. 
Insiders do not doubt that the postponement in the royal 
decrees should be blamed above all on delaying maneuvers by the 
PS. 
  This party, which is closely linked to the Walloon arms 
lobby, had every interest in the longest possible maintenance of 
the arms export licence system provided for under the outdated 
1962 act. Only when a parliamentary committee of inquiry was set 
up due to the efforts of Louis Vanvelthoven [Dutch-speaking wing 
of Socialist Party], Nelly Maes [The People's Union] and Johan 
Van Hecke [Christian People's Party], could work be started on 
changing the law. On 10 September the text was published in the 
Official Journal. Scarcely two weeks later the ``Martens 
eight'' government fell over different interpretations by the 
communities of certain articles in the act. The French-speakers 
wanted a large arms delivery to Saudi Arabia. And they had 
their way, due to the lack of implementation decrees for the new 
act. Subsequently a mediocre scheme applied of ``federalized'' 
ministry arms export committees, each of which decided on the 
allocation of arms export licences for its own region. The task 
has been taken over by ministers Claes and Urbain since the 
present government took office. 
<H5>  Political Support </H5>
  Belgian arms exports mainly benefit two companies located in 
Wallonia, namely Mecar and FNNH [New National Factory of 
Herstal, formerly FN]. Mecar produces a product range 
comparable to that of PRB, which in the meantime has been sold 
to the British Astra company. Mecar is a subsidiary of Allied 
Research Associates and most of its shareholders are U.S. 
officers and Saudi Arabian sheiks. Virtually the whole of 
Mecar's production is destined for countries like Kuwait, Saudi 
Arabia and until recently Iraq. Specialists point to the 
possibility of Mecar being specially set up in Belgium by the 
United States to get maximum benefit from the flexible Belgian 
legislation on arms exports. The Walloon-U.S. ammunition maker 
can count on the virtually unconditional support of a number of 
Walloon politicians. 
  The same applies to FNNH, at present owned by the French 
Giat 
[Association of Land-Based Weapons Industries] group. FN has 
long been the country's most famous arms producer. The Walloon 
regional investment company SRIW has not only provided repeated 
financial support to Mecar and FNNH. To safeguard the export 
licences of both companies, at the end of 1991 PS chairman Guy 
Spitaels was even prepared to have a political and institutional 
crisis, which led to the fall of the Martens cabinet.

<F P=106> [Report by own correspondent G.T.: ``Senator Nelly Maes </F>
Confirms Massive Arms Export''] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels, 30 Dec -- ``The data published 
yesterday by DE MORGEN are correct,'' according to Nelly Maes, 
VU [The People's Union] senator. For years she has been quietly 
battling weapons exports. After comparing DE MORGEN's articles 
with her own records based on numerous parliamentary questions, 
Senator Maes claims that the data perfectly match her 
information. [passage omitted summarizing referenced DE MORGEN 
articles] 
  In her opinion, some blatant samples of hypocrisy are the 
delivery of mortars to Zaire on 4 December 1991, the delivery of 
guns and munition to Angola on 3 April 1991, or the export of 
808 crates of kalashnikovs to Saudi Arabia on 19 July 1991.

<F P=106> [Report by Luc Van Broeck: ``With MOX in Nuclear Plant, </F>
Radiation for Staff Increases Slightly''] 
  [Text] Doel, 28 Dec -- Following an extremely turbulent 
discussion, the Chamber passed the controversial MOX resolution. 
From now on spent nuclear fuels can be recycled into MOX fuel, 
to be used in nuclear plants. According to Electrabel the 
recycling of plutonium into MOX from spent nuclear fuels is a 
far better solution than the very expensive storage. Electrabel 
points out that MOX is already used on a regular basis in 
similar reactors in Switzerland, Germany, and France, without 
any safety problems. 
  According to Electrabel the use of MOX will hardly change 
anything to Doel's operation and safety. ``Surveys have 
established that the use of MOX in a nuclear plant raises the 
collective radiation dose for the staff by 1 percent at the 
most, which is much less than the normal variations from one 
year to another. For the people living close to the nuclear 
plant nothing changes,'' Electrabel says. 
  The standard fuel elements which are currently used in the 
nuclear plants at Doel and Tihange do not contain any plutonium 
when they are loaded into the reactor, but they do when they are 
removed from the reactor at a rate of roughly 5 kg of plutonium 
per element. So the main difference between a MOX- and a 
standard fuel element is the presence of plutonium. The term 
MOX refers to mixed oxide, made up of uranium and plutonium 
oxide. 
  In pursuance of a contract which was concluded in 1978, a 
small part of Belgium's spent nuclear fuel will be reprocessed 
in the French reprocessing plant at La Haque until the year 
2000. Approximately 4,600 kg of plutonium will be recovered from 
these nuclear fuels. From the end of 1993 onwards, this 
quantity must return to Belgium, through annual deliveries. 
  ``We should not forget,'' Electrabel emphasizes, ``that 300 
to 400 tonnes of MOX fuel is enough to ensure the whole Belgian 
power production for three years.''

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Isnard: ``A New Nuclear Missile on the </F>
Plateau of Albion?''] 
  [Text] For the first time, Francois Mitterrand is not 
ruling out the plan to bury a new missile in the silos of the 
plateau of Albion to replace the S-3D missiles currently there. 
In fact, although he does not give the code name, the French 
president is talking about the MS-5 strategic missile program, 
which is shrouded in the greatest secrecy. This missile would 
be intended to arm both so-called new-generation submarines by 
the year 2005 and the silos buried in upper Provence. 
  Since the early 1970's, the plateau of Albion has 
accommodated 18 ground-to-ground missiles capable of carrying a 
1-megaton nuclear payload over a distance of approximately 5,000 
km. These missiles have since been modernized. In view of the 
missiles' aptitude at thwarting -- or not thwarting -- hostile 
defense forces, which have supposedly gained in efficiency in 
the meantime, the missile base of the plateau of Albion could be 
obsolete by the beginning of next century. Hence the current 
debate aimed at determining the weapons system which might 
succeed the one currently deployed on the plateau of Albion. 
  The debate is all about whether France can maintain three 
different systems -- ground-to-ground missiles, sea-to-ground 
missiles, and air-to-ground missiles, as is the case today -- or 
whether it should only maintain two of these -- and, if so, 
determining which system could be abandoned. The answers given 
by the experts vary tremendously. Nothing has been decided as 
yet, and the next military planning law, which will cover the 
years 1995 to 2000, will no doubt judge the merits of the 
different options. 
  Recently, General Vincent Lanata, chief of staff of the Air 
Force whose forces serve the Albion plateau and whose aircraft 
carry air-to-ground missiles, has expressed his wish to have a 
more advanced airborne missile at his disposal. 
  Consequently, Mr. Mitterrand, who sets great store by the 
political and strategic symbol represented by the plateau of 
Albion, has just spoken for the first time about the possibility 
of simultaneously deploying -- both in French submarines and in 
the silos in Provence -- missiles which are based on the same 
basic design but can be adapted to either launch mode. This is 
the program dubbed MS-5, involving a missile with multiple 
warheads and a range of 8,000 km. 
  If this approach were definitively retained, it would 
presuppose that financial priority had already been given to the 
M-5 missile project, the version intended for submarines. 
However, what does one find? Launched in 1992, back when 
Pierre Joxe was defense minister, the program has been slowed 
down by the Balladur government in 1994 [year as published], to 
the great displeasure of the missile's constructor, the 
Aerospatiale group, whose CEO, Louis Gallois, has unceasingly 
maintained that the M-5 is of primary interest. The M-5 even 
figures among the projects threatened with being staggered over 
an even longer period -- along with the future transport plane, 
the antimissile defense systems, certain equipment for use in 
space, and the NH-90 logistical helicopter -- if the military 
planning law allocates insufficient funds.

<F P=106> [Joachim Wille report: ``Siemens Has Nuclear Fuel Processed </F>
in Russian Nuclear Factory''] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 23 December -- Siemens AG and the 
FRG Environment Ministry have confirmed information obtained by 
FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU about cooperation between the German 
corporation and a Russian nuclear factory in the processing of 
nuclear fuels. As Siemens spokesman Rainer Jend said in Hanau 
upon inquiry, a first shipment of uranium material to the Tomsk 
nuclear complex in Siberia had already taken place without this 
so far being made public knowledge. 
  A total of 140 tonnes of ``slightly impure residue'' 
obtained 
in the production of nuclear power station fuel elements at 
Hanau are to be reprocessed in Tomsk by the end of next year. 
This is stipulated by a ``service contract'' concluded with the 
Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy. In return, Siemens imports 
two shipments of about 70 tonnes of so-called enriched 
uranium-hexafluoride from Tomsk in order to manufacture new fuel 
elements in Hanau. The nuclear waste produced during processing 
in Tomsk is disposed of in Russia. According to Siemens, only 
small quantities are involved. 
  The Siemens spokesman pointed out that the deal with the 
``Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises Tomsk,'' a branch of 
the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, has been approved and 
supported by the responsible German and Russian bodies. 
According to him, the Federal Radiation Protection Office, the 
Federal Export Office, and the European nuclear authority 
EURATOM were involved. As Cay Friemuth, spokesman of the Bonn 
Environment Ministry, said, the permits were granted as early as 
in July 1993 with the participation of his Ministry and of the 
Economics Ministry. The first shipment to Tomsk was sent on its 
way via the land and sea route on 21 October. According to the 
regulations of the nuclear law, the permit must be renewed for 
1994; this will probably be done, Friemuth said. 
  Upon inquiry by FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU, Siemens spokesman 
Jend 
said that it is still open whether the 140-tonne project will 
turn into lasting cooperation with the nuclear complex in 
Siberia. However, he pointed to the ``cooperation agreement for 
the field of nuclear fuel circulation,'' which was concluded by 
Siemens and Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov in 
September. This agreement involved joint projects in, for 
instance, the construction and storage of fuel elements and the 
processing of plutonium from the Russian nuclear weapons. 
  The 140 tonnes of impure uranium material, which have 
accumulated in Hanau, cannot be purified and enriched on site, 
according to Jend, because the part of the fuel element factory, 
which would be suitable for this work, has been closed down 
since a hydrogen explosion on 12 December 1990. Processing in 
Hanau would be possible only in the new Siemens factory, about 
the approval of which Siemens and the Hesse land government have 
been engaged in a legal quarrel for some time. Jend said: 
``You must ask Minister (Joschka) Fischer, when we can do that 
in Hanau.'' 
  Asked about the safety of Russian nuclear factories, Jend 
said that Siemens experts convinced themselves in Tomsk that the 
processing would be conducted in line with the internationally 
usual Purex process and that ``high quality standards'' are 
achieved in the process. Jend did not accept the reference to 
the nuclear accident in Tomsk, during which an explosion 
released plutonium last spring and 200 square kilometers were 
radioactively contaminated. This ``was in a completely 
different corner'' of the large nuclear complex, where several 
thousand people work. 
  In its assessment of the safety in Tomsk, the Environment 
Ministry relies on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
in Vienna, which has access to Tomsk. Spokesman Friemuth said 
that his Ministry has to accept the safety standards if the IAEA 
does not have any indications of irregularities.

<F P=106> [``deu''-signed report: ``Union Bundestag Group Wants To </F>
Facilitate Arms Exports''] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The dispute dividing government and 
opposition on the subject of arms export controls is 
intensifying. Pressured by the arms industry, the coalition 
Bundestag groups and the Economics Ministry are trying to relax 
the German guidelines for arms export, which are stricter than 
those of most other countries. One of the reasons for this is 
job security. The foreign policy spokesman of the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag 
Group, Karl Lamers, told a newspaper that the German arms export 
guidelines put German companies at a disadvantage: ``Thousands 
of jobs and high-tech know-how that are of enormous importance 
for the civilian industry threaten to be lost.'' 
  Lamers demands a uniform European Union [EU] policy on arms 
exports. This is also mentioned as an objective in the section 
on joint foreign and security policy of the Maastricht treaty. 
Lamers said that, due to the resistance of other European 
states, however, the high German standards cannot be maintained 
in Brussels. 
  Bonn's attempts to facilitate the exporting of arms via 
Brussels meet with strong resistance from the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD]. SPD Bundestag Group manager Peter 
Struck said the constitution demands that the Bundestag has to 
be consulted by the Federal Government first. The 
constitutional amendment passed when the Maastricht treaty was 
ratified says: ``The Federal Government, before agreeing to an 
introduction of new laws by the EU, gives the Bundestag the 
opportunity to comment. The Federal Government bases its 
negotiations on these comments.'' 
  The deputy SPD chairwoman and European affairs expert, 
Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, accused the government of negotiating 
a softening-up of the arms export guidelines in the European 
Council of Ministers, ``behind the Bundestag's back, ignoring 
the constitution, and excluding the public.'' The government is 
``by no means entitled to do this.'' 
  The Economics Ministry denies negotiating uniform export 
guidelines for traditional armament products within the EU. 
These negotiations only refer to dual-use products. This means 
products that can be used for both civilian and military 
purposes, such as machinery, special steels, and pesticides. 
The government coordinator for aerospace and space technology, 
Reinhard Goehner, has repeatedly said that it will not be 
possible to maintain the strict German export regulations. 
Negotiations on dual-use products have reached the final stage. 
  The German guidelines for traditional arms and dual-use 
products were tightened after the Second Gulf War in early 1991. 
United Nations inspectors had discovered that a large share of 
Iraqi dictator Saddam Husayn's arms supply came from German 
companies. Since then, the German arms industry constantly 
complained about disadvantages as compared to other countries, 
especially France and Great Britain. 
  Arms producers from these countries have blamed the Germans 
for being unreliable, the German arms industry said. Over the 
past four years, 280,000 jobs were lost in the armament 
industry. Yet, according to the Stockholm-based SIPRI 
Institute, with a 3.1 billion German marks turnover, Germany was 
still the world's third-largest arms exporter in 1992.

<F P=106> [Article signed: ``Pilatus: Oscar J. Schwenk Named Director </F>
for Development''; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Zurich, 20 Dec (ATSA) -- Aircraft manufacturer 
Pilatus based in Stans (Nidwalden demicanton) has appointed a 
new director to replace Walter Gubler, who was fired last March. 
Oerlikon-Buehrle, the group to which Pilatus belongs, announced 
that Oscar J. Schwenk will take up duties on 1 January 1994. 
Ernst Thomke, who temporarily managed the company after Mr. 
Gubler left, will resume his responsibilities as president of 
the administrative council. 
  Oscar Schwenk has been working for Pilatus since 1981, most 
recently as a member of the board of directors responsible for 
the division ``operations.'' His predecessor had been dismissed 
with immediate effect on 26 March 1993. Mr. Gubler was blamed 
for having authorized a second delivery of aircraft to Burma, 
although he knew that the planes in the first delivery had been 
equipped with arms. 
  With this dismissal, Pilatus wanted to start anew. At the 
time the company declared that in the future it wanted to avoid 
at all costs the possibility of its planes being equipped with 
arms. Pilatus wants to establish itself more strongly in the 
small civil airplane market. For instance, during the summer, 
the manufacturer had tried to take over the American company 
Piper. 
  This past summer, Ernst Thomke together with Hans Widmer, 
head of Oerlikon-Buehrle, had strongly committed themselves to 
exporting training planes to South Korea and Nigeria. At the 
end of September, the federal council had agreed on the delivery 
of 20 PC-9 planes to South Korea and to seven PC-7 planes to 
Nigeria. 
  Ernst Thomke, a Swiss manager, had left the board of SMH 
[Swiss Corporation for Microelectronics and Watchmaking 
Industries Ltd.] on 1 June 1991. He had played an important 
role in the success of Swatch. One year later he became manager 
of operations for the group Motor-Columbus. 
  Mr. Thomke, who lives in Granges, is a member of the 
administrative councils of ATEL, SAEG Refindus, Studer Revox, 
and Swissmetri. Rumour has it that he might succeed the 
director of Ascom, Leonardo Vannotti. He himself denies being 
contacted by Ascom.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) held a second official 
working-level contact Monday [10 January] but failed to make any 
progress on arranging IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear 
facilities. 
  Yun Ho-chin, a councilor at the North Korean Embassy in 
Vienna, represented his country at the two-hour talks, in which 
the IAEA explained technical details of the need to maintain 
continuity in surveillance materials in response to the North 
Korean position conveyed at the first meeting Friday [7 January]. 
  The IAEA presented its explanation and demands to the North 
Korean side on paper. 
  ``The North Korean representative and the IAEA had a 
working-level contact to discuss problems of inspection on North 
Korea's reported nuclear facilities on Monday,'' IAEA Spokesman 
Hans Meyer said. 
  ``At the meeting, the IAEA has conveyed technical 
requirements (for the inspection) to the North Korean side.'' 
  Meyer declined to disclose further information. 
  One IAEA source said, however, the IAEA action means that 
there are differences of opinion on the scope of the inspection 
on North Korea's seven reported nuclear facilities. 
  Practical problems such as dispatch of the inspection team 
could be discussed only after the two sides agree on the scope 
of the inspection, the source said, requesting anonymity. 
  At Friday's meeting, North Korea told the IAEA that it would 
not accept inspection of two sites, a radiochemical laboratory 
that is in effect a nuclear reprocessing facility and a 
5-megawatt reactor, another IAEA source said. 
  As a result, the two sides are standing far apart as the 
IAEA 
demands opening of those two facilities as well, the source said. 
  Spokesman David Kyd, meanwhile, said that the IAEA does not 
expect immediate progress in the problem of inspection on two 
unreported sites believed to be nuclear waste storage facilities. 
  The two sides are expected to resume their talks this week.

  [Text] During a working-level contact with North Korea on 
10 January, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
delivered a technological check list on the collection of 
samples from nuclear material and the examination of an 
operation diary [unyong ilchi] of seven nuclear facilities and 
requested that North Korea inform the IAEA of its decision on 
accepting inspections within this week. 
  The IAEA also informed the North Korean side that in order 
to 
inspect seven facilities in accordance with the technological 
check list, it is necessary that at least six to seven 
inspectors carry out activities for three weeks. 
  It was learned that the technological check list delivered 
to 
North Korea includes items on determining if the number and 
material of the five megawatt-nuclear fuel rods in Yongbyon 
correspond with what North Korea had previously reported to the 
IAEA, examining the operation diary, and replacing surveillance 
equipment. 
  In particular, it was learned that, if a radiochemical 
laboratory is a reprocessing facility, the amount of nuclear 
material remaining in tanks and pipes will be measured. In 
addition, samples from the laboratory will collected and 
inspectors will check sealed devices and replace surveillance 
equipment. Public attention is focused on the North Korean 
response, which is expected in two or three days.

  [Text] Baghdad, Jan 9 (AFP) -- International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) experts are preparing the transfer of a second 
batch of Iraqi enriched uranium to Russia, UN sources said here 
Sunday. 
  The team is working at a site near Baghdad and hopes to 
complete its mission by the end of January, the sources said 
without specifying the quantity involved. 
  Last month the same group supervised the removal and 
shipment 
by air of 33 kilograms (73 pounds) of irradiated fuel from Iraq 
to Russia. 
  In October, IAEA chief Maurizio Zifferero said that some 35 
kilograms (77 pounds) of enriched uranium would be transferred 
to Russia. 
  The IAEA, a Vienna-based United Nations agency, and Iraq 
signed an accord in April for the removal of 35 kilograms of 
uranium. The agreement was reached during a mission of IAEA 
inspectors led by Zifferero, who said at the time that the 
operation would cost Iraq several million dollars. 
  Last November the IAEA shipped 12 kilograms (27 pounds) of 
non- enriched uranium from Iraq to Russia. 
  The transfers are in line with UN Security Council 
resolutions to disarm Iraq after the Gulf war in 1991.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan 8 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has accepted 
U.S. demands to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) to inspect its nuclear sites in principle, but with the 
proviso that the IAEA inspectors do not take samples of the fuel 
rods, the ASAHI SHIMBUN reported Saturday. 
  The IAEA is going to consult with North Korea on details of 
the inspection soon, and the United States is trying to persuade 
it to allow the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks 
to make a decision on the issue of taking samples, the daily 
newspaper quoted a South Korean Government source as saying. 
  North Korea said that, of its seven declared nuclear 
installations, it would rather not allow inspections of the 
5,000 kilowatt experimental reactor and radiochemical 
laboratory, according to the paper. 
  Pyongyang has insisted that it would never allow the 
inspectors to take samples from fuel rods, a process that is 
indispensable to measuring of the amount of plutonium that has 
been extracted. 
  The United States agreed to discuss the sample problem and 
special inspections of two undeclared sites in the high-level 
talks, the paper said. 
  At an inspection in 1992, the IAEA asked North Korea for 
fuel 
rod samples but was rebuffed. 
  ``We had not prepared to halt our experimental reactors,'' 
they were told. ``The crane to pull up the fuel rods is out of 
order.'' 
  With the North Korean condition, the IAEA is dissatisfied 
with the inspection, but the United States is persuading it that 
it is more important to solve the North Korean nuclear problem 
through dialogue, the ASAHI said.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] plans 
to increase significantly the number of inspection experts and 
send them to Pyongyang in order to restore the continuity of 
inspections, which was greatly damaged by the suspension of 
operation of monitoring equipment in North Korean nuclear 
facilities and by North Korea's refusal of inspections. 
  A relevant IAEA high-ranking official said that through 
overall inspections [chonmyon sachal], which will be resumed in 
the future, the IAEA plans to restore the damaged continuity of 
inspections of North Korea. Toward this end, it will send the 
inspection team to Pyongyang after adding three or four 
additional experts. 
  He stressed that the IAEA plans to send an inspection team 
of 
approximately seven experts to Pyongyang for the nuclear 
inspection of North Korea, which will be resumed in the future. 
He said he was not sure if North Korea would accept the seven 
experts because the IAEA has not received an official message 
from the North Korean side yet. He said, however, that the IAEA 
plans to discuss the issue with North Korea through 
consultations. 
  He stressed that the inspections must be regularly conducted 
in order to completely restore the continuity of inspections and 
he expressed the hope that North Korea will respond positively. 
  He said that the inspection team, which is ready to go to 
North Korea now, is standing by in order to change monitoring 
equipment in North Korean nuclear facilities, including six 
monitoring cameras and over 40 pieces of sealing equipment 
[pongin changchi] and to check in detail the total stock of 
nuclear material that has not yet been examined.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Crowning months of secret negotiations 
and reciprocal visits, in early December Brazil and Russia 
signed a broad trade agreement designed to boost their annual 
trade from $200 million to $2 billion within a five-year period. 
The agreement includes cooperation in aerospace research, mutual 
technology transfer of military materiel, joint ventures in oil 
production and construction, and other transactions. 
  Brazil and Russia signed a trade agreement on 3 December to 
increase their annual trade from $200 million to $2 billion over 
the next five years, military correspondent William Waack 
reported in the 4 December conservative daily O ESTADO DE SAO 
PAULO. During his official visit to Russia from 1 to 3 December, 
Brazilian Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Jose 
Eduardo de Andrade Vieira and Russian Foreign Economic Relations 
Minister Oleg Davydov discussed the possibilities of space 
research, transfer of supersonic airplane technology, and 
exports of Brazilian foodstuffs. Waack noted, however, that 
everything still hinges on an interbanking agreement that has 
not even been initiated. 
  During his Moscow trip, Waack continued, Vieira also visited 
the Moscow Space Center and was again told by the Russians that 
they would like to use the Alcantara launch site in Maranhao 
State for the international Iridium project. Vieira spoke 
favorably of the project, which envisages placing roughly 60 
communication satellites in orbit within the next two years, and 
said that he would present it to Brazilian President Franco. 
Moscow's independent, business-oriented KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 4 
December, however, said that plans for Russian participation in 
the project were being developed ``at Brazil's suggestion.'' The 
Moscow state-run news agency ITAR-TASS on 3 December also quoted 
Vieira as saying that he had met earlier in the day with Russian 
Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin to discuss Brazil's 
participation in the international Iridium space communications 
project involving the use of Russian Proton booster rockets. 
Brazil's O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 4 December cited diplomats 
familiar with this issue saying that ``the main obstacle'' to 
this project would soon be removed: The Brazilian government is 
now ``willing'' to join the Missile Technology Control Regime 
soon, accepting ``an international code of conduct that does not 
allow the transfer of the technology for building and operating 
missiles to third parties.'' 
<H5>  Arms and Aerospace </H5>
  KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 4 December noted that ``Russia has long 
been mulling over plans for an outlet to the Latin American arms 
market. Brazil may become a good springboard for the products of 
the Russian aerospace complex. In Moscow, the Brazilian side 
once again expressed interest in joint development of inertial 
guidance systems for space-launch vehicles.'' 
  O ESTADO of 4 December reported that the Monteiro Aranha 
Group has been negotiating for 18 months with the Russians to 
purchase defense materiel to assemble Russian MiG-29 supersonic 
fighters at the Brazilian Aeronautics Company (Embraer) 
facilities, as well as to buy ships and helicopters. The source 
quoted one of Vieira's advisers to the effect that the Monteiro 
Aranha Group ``sought a fait accompli so the Armed Forces would 
have to approve these deals.'' 
  Moscow's ITAR-TASS and official military newspaper KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA, as well as various Brazilian dailies, speculated 
extensively during September on the ongoing negotiations between 
the two countries over possible swaps of Russian war materiel 
for Brazilian foodstuffs. Rio de Janeiro daily JORNAL DO BRASIL 
on 1 December, however, noted that Frederico Robalinho, trade 
policy secretary of the Brazilian Ministry of Industry and 
Commerce, has denied knowing anything about reported Brazilian 
government purchases of Russian arms. According to JORNAL, 
reports of possible exchanges of Russian arms for Brazilian food 
products began circulating in September when Brazilian Army 
Minister Zenildo Zoroastro de Lucena visited Russia. Robalinho, 
however, commented only that Brazil is interested in the 
purchase of helicopters such as the MI-26, spare parts and 
maintenance of military equipment, as well as a nonmilitary ship 
to replace the ``Barao de Tefe'' in the Antarctic. Robalinho, 
JORNAL added, described this negotiation as ``historic'' because 
Brazil and Russia are for the first time carrying out an accord 
that will develop all possible trade opportunities. 
  In a related press report, the weekly Sao Paulo news 
magazine 
ISTOE reported on 24 November that the Brazilian Army will 
receive Russian surface-to-air missiles that will be distributed 
to various infantry headquarters. The delivery of the missiles, 
according to ISTOE, will begin early in 1994. In an earlier 
``exclusive'' report (ISTOE, 18 November) regarding the 
negotiations between Brazil and Russia, Army Minister General 
Zoroastro lauded the ``great efficiency of light arms, 
particularly grenade launchers, manufactured by the Russian 
defense industry. General Zoroastro also announced that talks 
between Brazil and Russia to designate a Brazilian Armed Forces 
attache to Moscow have been concluded; likewise, Russia would 
have an Army attache assigned to Brasilia.'' 
<H5>  Background of the Accord </H5>
  On 18 November, leading Sao Paulo business daily GAZETA 
MERCANTIL provided considerable detail on the scope and 
background of the then upcoming Russia-Brazil trade accord. 
GAZETA commented that the governments of Brazil and Russia had 
concluded their largest ever economic agreement, the result of 
``authentic diplomatic engineering spanning five years of secret 
negotiations'' and the ``final intermediation, in the Brazilian 
private sector, by the two Rio entrepreneurial groups, Monteiro 
Aranha and its associate, ITS Participacoes.'' The accord 
provides for bilateral trade increasing to $5 billion in the 
next five years, with financing from the two governments. The 
annual volume of trade anticipated is almost six times greater 
than the $172 million projected for 1993, GAZETA added. 
  During this period, GAZETA continued, Brazil is committing 
itself to purchasing various Russian arms and ammunition, 
rockets, large military helicopters for use in the Amazon 
Region, special fishing boats and ice- breakers, hydraulic and 
thermal turbines and generators, petroleum and its by-products, 
gas, chemical-pharmaceutical products, fertilizers, nonferrous 
metals, primarily aluminum and its by-products, and Portland 
cement. Russia, in turn, will buy from Brazil the following: 
designs for hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants; 
agricultural equipment; beef and pork; soybeans and derivatives; 
sugar, cocoa, and coffee; textiles; and finished and 
semifinished shoes. 
  Two lines of credit have been specially established in the 
``store account'' system, GAZETA continued. In sales of raw 
materials and commodities to Russia, the term of payment will be 
one year and at London Inter-Bank Overnight Rate (LIBOR) rates. 
In exports of equipment, machines, and manufactured products, 
the term will be five years, also at LIBOR rates. Banks and 
firms directly involved are Bank of Brazil, Sao Paulo State 
Bank, Monteiro Aranha, Andrade Gutierrez, Embraer, Brazilian 
Petroleum Corporation (Petrobras), Ceval, Vinicola Aurora, 
Tramontina, Iochpe-Maxion, Grendene, Portobello, Olvebra, Artex, 
and Neiva. 
  KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 4 December said that lines of credit 
from 
the Russian side will probably be provided by Mosbiznesbank, 
Mezhkombank, Imperial Bank, and the Export-Import Bank. The 
accord also provides for the establishment of ``joint ventures'' 
including the following enterprises: 
  --Andrade Gutierrez and Monteiro Aranha, in association 
with Agrarian Technologies of Russia, Neftkom, MID-Continent of 
the United States and John Brown of Great Britain, to design and 
build a refinery in Krasnodar; 
  --Brazilian firms and Anglo Resources Ltd. in oil 
exploration in the Stavropol Basin; 
  --Monteiro Aranha and Anglo Siberian Oil Ltd. in developing 
the design and construction of a refinery in Krasnoyarsk, as 
well as participating in the consortium to build a bridge over 
the Yenisey River in the same area. 
  Providing an historical perspective to the agreement, GAZETA 
went on to say that from the diplomatic standpoint, this accord 
with Russia has a very special strategic dimension, particularly 
concerning cooperation in ``sensitive'' technologies that will 
be started with ``very small-scale transactions.'' Such, it went 
on to say, is the case of the association of Embraer with the 
Russian aeronautical and space conglomerate, Aviaprom, together 
with Mashinoeksport, the sectoral foreign ``trading'' company. 
The two Russian firms presented a formal proposal to Embraer to 
form a multinational group, in which Argentine and South African 
state firms would participate to develop the CBA-123, a civilian 
aircraft that has been gradually developed by Embraer. Aviaprom 
and Mashinoeksport subsequently invited Embraer to examine their 
``Delfine'' and ``Be-30'' models with Russian TVD-1500 and 
TVD-20 turbines of similar performance to the U.S. Garrett 
TRF3SI-20 that would be used in the CBA-123. The three firms 
then began the technical discussion involving the ``plan, 
production, and sales'' of a line of agricultural planes with 
two basic models having a capacity of up to 0.6 and 2.5 tons 
respectively. 
  The technical discussions, GAZETA continued, were followed 
by 
a letter from Aviaprom President A. Gereshchenko to Embraer 
President Ozires Silva in October 993 noting that ``we have a 
good basis for cooperation.'' There followed a written 
invitation from Gereshchenko and Mashinoeksport Vice President 
I. Latin for Embraer to participate in ``the creation and 
operation'' of the Burlak aerospace complex. Both Gereshchenko 
and Latin had been in Brazil in February l993 in a secret visit 
to the Alcantara launch site in Maranhao, GAZETA pointed out, 
and then noted that 10 weeks later, Embraer, Neiva, Aviaprom, 
and the Myaslshchev Design Bureau signed a protocol to launch 
communica- tion satellites from Alcantara. There was, according 
to GAZETA, a parallel accord between the Monteiro Aranha group 
and Khrunichev Enterprise to use Russian rockets as launchers. 
The Monteiro Aranha group also signed an agreement with 
Rostvertol in Rostov to sell large Russian helicopters of the 
Mil line in Brazil. 
  GAZETA further noted that in September 1993, Army Minister 
General Zoroastro headed a military delegation to Russia to 
study military equipment and missile technologies available to 
Brazil, and added that the Brazilian Government has been trying 
to attract partners to its space program by offering the use of 
the Alcantara site, where satellite launches cost an average 20 
percent less than from any other launch site in the world. In 
addition to Russia, Brazil is engaged in negotiations with 
China, which Strategic Affairs Secretariat Minister-Chief Mario 
Cesar Flores has often called ``the partner of the future,'' 
GAZETA concluded.

  [Text] Prague, Dec 22 (CTK) -- Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin ``emphatically,'' requested Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec during his visit to Israel last week that the Czech 
Republic not supply any nuclear power components to Iran, not 
even components considered useful exclusively for peaceful 
purposes, Israeli Ambassador to Czech Republic Moshe Yegar told 
CTK today. 
  He added that any deliveries to Iran having to do with 
nuclear energy are extraordinarily dangerous. 
  While in Israel, Zieleniec denied that any Czech exports to 
Iran could be used for non-peaceful purposes. 
  The Israeli Government's request to the Czech Republic is 
justified by the ``terrorist'' nature of the contemporary regime 
in Iran, the ambassador explained. He said Iran wants to obtain 
nuclear weapons ``at any cost,'' and references to allegedly 
peaceful uses of nuclear power are only excuses to attain that 
goal. 
  Nuclear potential in Iran would be ``an extraordinary and 
alarming danger'' for the entire near east, Yegar warned. 
  The Czech company Skoda Plzen, which has experience in 
building nuclear power plants, admitted last week that its 
director had visited Teheran in November allegedly to discuss 
``supplies of parts for a nuclear power plant.'' 
  The American daily THE NEW YORK TIMES reported that 
according 
to American intelligence services, Iran has engaged in a secret 
program for the production of nuclear weapons. The paper said 
that Americans fear that Czech civil supplies could help Iran to 
obtain nuclear waste, which it could then transform into 
plutonium, the main component in nuclear explosives.

  [Text] Moscow, RIA -- The contract for supplies of rocket 
engines and technology from Russia to India, concluded in 1991 
between the commercial company Glavkosmos and the Indian Space 
Research Organisation [ISRO], may be saved, a Glavkosmos 
official, asking not to be identified, suggested in an interview 
with a RIA correspondent. 
  The fulfilment of the 2.250 million rupees contract was 
suspended after the United States accused Russia of violating 
the regime of control over the transfer of rocket technologies. 
In the opinion of the American side, India could use the 
Russian engines for launching its ballistic missiles. 
  In December 1993 a delegation of Glavkosmos held talks with 
the representatives of ISRO, during which a new version of the 
agreement was worked out. It has been sent for approval to the 
Russian Government. In the opinion of Glavkosmos experts, there 
is now hope that this version will be approved because ``both 
politically and economically it is advantageous to Russia and 
does not violate the terms of the control regime.'' 
  Glavkosmos has already received over 1 billion rupees from 
the ISRO and is planning on account of the remaining part of the 
contract to transfer to India two take-off rocket blocks and 
equipment for their operation. India, in turn, guarantees 
Glavkosmos specialists access to the places of assembly, testing 
and launching of its rockets with mounted Russian engines.

Der Stee Starts Action Against Rotterdam Dry Dock Company's 
Trade With Taiwan''] 
  [Text] The Hague, 22 Dec -- Former Minister A. van der Stee 
(CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]) is heading a group of major 
Netherlands companies lobbying to halt the possible export of 
submarine parts by RDM [Rotterdam Dry Dock Company] to Taiwan. 
  The group, comprising representatives of Shell, Akzo, DSM 
[Dutch State Mines], Philips, Stork, and Fokker, fears that, if 
RDM's deliveries to Taiwan are carried out, it will have a 
negative impact on their trade relations with the PRC. 
  RDM has an opportunity to deliver nonstrategic parts for 
submarines to Taiwan. Such an order, which is expected to be 
worth several hundred million guilders, is very important for 
the Rotterdam company's existence. 
  Van der Stee, who is chairman of the China section of the 
Netherlands Center for Trade Promotion (NCH), confirmed this 
morning that he had recently talked to Prime Minister Lubbers, 
Economic Affairs Minister Andriessen, Finance Minister Kok, and 
Foreign Minister Kooijmans in an attempt to protect the 
Netherlands companies' interests in the PRC. ``The Chinese 
surely will condemn us for our hypocritical policy and this will 
have a negative effect on our trade relations,'' Van der Stee 
claimed. ``China currently has a 10-13 percent growth rate and 
the Netherlands should profit from that. One must avoid 
anything that could conflict with this interest.''

<F P=106> [Report by Georges Timmerman: ``Saudi Arabia Remains a Mega </F>
Customer''] 
  [Text] Brussels 29 Dec -- Most of the 120 major weapons 
shipments from the ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge in recent 
years have been destined for Saudi Arabia or the other Gulf 
States. 
  Detailed information in DE MORGEN's possession shows that 
between January 1991 and April 1993 more than 40 consignments of 
Belgian weapons left for Saudi Arabia, seven went to Qatar, five 
to Oman and five to the United Arab Emirates. 
  Mecar-Seneffe [subsidiary of Allied Research Associates] 
mainly supplied smoke generators, igniters, percussion caps, 
rifle grenades and mortar bombs to the Saudis. However, FN 
Herstal [National Factory of Herstal] was the biggest supplier. 
  This company supplied hundreds of pallets of ammunition of 
every caliber, automatic hand weapons, rifles, machine guns, 
heavy machine guns, mortars, Kalashnikovs, hand grenades, 
antitank projectiles, anti-aircraft artillery and components for 
every type of other weapon. 
  The lists of arms shipments from our two sea harbors show 
that a considerable share of Belgian arms exports were destined 
for Third- World countries. 
  For example arms shipments went to Thailand (11 tonnes of 
war 
ammunition and 755 tonnes of components for 155-mm projectiles 
from FN Herstal on 8 February 1991), Venezuela (2,000 rocket 
motors and 1,560 rocket heads from Forges de Zeebruges on 12 
February 1991, 13 tonnes of ammunition and projectiles on 31 
December 1991), Chile (two 90-mm cannons with accessories from 
Cockerill-Seraing on 14 May 1991 and 28 February 1992), Botswana 
(some 7 tonnes of arms, components and bayonets from FN Herstal 
on 19 September 1991), Taiwan (3 tonnes of arms and components 
from FN Herstal on 14 January 1993, various shipments of rocket 
motors from Forges de Zeebruges) and Indonesia (79 tonnes of 
ball powder from PB Clermont on 13 December 1991). 
  Third-World countries were also massively supplied with 
Belgian arms from Ostend and Zaventem airports. 
  To give a few examples: 945 kg of explosives, grenades, and 
gas masks to Rwanda (6 January 1993), 14.9 tonnes of arms 
components and ammunition to Dubai (28 April 1991), 144 kg of 
arms to Singapore (29 July 1991), 325 kg of mortars to Zaire (4 
December 1991), more than 5 tonnes of arms and accessories to 
Jordan (25 March 1992), 425 kg of ammunition to Burkina Faso (23 
April 1992), 320 kg of arms to Brazil (24 September 1992), and 9 
tonnes of ammunition and 22 tonnes of explosive to Somalia (19 
December 1992).

<F P=106> [Newsletter by XINHUA reporter Wang Jingcheng (3769 2417 </F>
6134): ``A Flower of Nuclear Science and Technology Jointly 
Cultivated by China and Algeria''] 
  [Text] Algiers, 24 Dec (XINHUA) -- At a little past 10 AM 
on 21 December, a special Boeing-767 plane landed on (Ain 
Wusela) military airfield 250 kilometers south of Algiers. 
Nearly 200 excited passengers, including Algerian government 
officials, most foreign diplomats in Algeria, and foreign and 
Algerian reporters, walked off the plane and continued the 
journey by bus toward a vast stretch of wilderness. Half an 
hour later, a cluster of beige buildings appeared on the horizon. 
  This is the site of (Ain Wusela) Science Town, so named in 
Algeria's development plan. The first group of buildings 
completed in the science town are those of the 15,000-kilowatt 
heavy water reactor built by Algeria in cooperation with China. 
On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between China and Algeria on 21 December, 
the Algerian government held a grand inauguration ceremony for 
the reactor. 
  The multi-function heavy water reactor was completed after 
five years of close cooperation between Chinese and Algerian 
scientists in overcoming various difficulties. China provided 
Algeria with technology and a complete set of facilities [she 
shi 6080 2457], and trained relevant Algerian scientists and 
technicians. During the one-year warranty period, the reactor, 
operated by Algerian scientists and technicians, has shown that 
it is up to the designed standards in all functions and 
composite indexes [zong he zhi biao 4844 0678 2172 2871]. 
  Djebbar, minister of national education of Algeria, presided 
over and addressed the ceremony. He said that the Algerian 
government is satisfied with the effective cooperation between 
the two countries in the high-technology field. During the 
ceremony, Algerian Foreign Minister Dembri said the reactor is 
entirely for the purpose of scientific research on the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy. For this reason, he solemnly declared in 
the name of his government: ``Algeria is preparing to join the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.'' His declaration immediately 
won warm applause from among the foreign diplomats, and Algerian 
and Chinese scientists and technicians present. 
  The reactor, named ``(As Salam),'' is an important means to 
raise Algeria's science research level, as well as an 
indispensable installation for training Algeria's nuclear 
scientists and technicians. During the course of construction, 
scientists and technicians of the two countries combated 
sand-storms and droughts, and completed the reactor and 
supportive structures on schedule. Moreover, they planted trees, 
landscaped the surroundings, and laid a foundation for further 
development of the science town in the vast wilderness. During 
the course of cooperation, they established a profound 
friendship and took pride in cultivating, with toil and sweat, a 
flower of nuclear science and technology in Algeria's scientific 
and technological field. 
  The host showed the reactor and its control system to 
foreign 
diplomats and reporters. In the control center where various 
lights were flashing, the visitors listened attentively to a 
briefing by an Algerian staff member with a PHd degree. While 
shaking this reporter's hand, the Congolese ambassador to 
Algeria said: ``I wholeheartedly wish China and Algeria success 
in this cooperative project.'' 
  After the visit, Li Dingfan, head of the Chinese delegation 
and deputy director of the State Atomic Energy Agency [guo jia 
yuan zi neng ji gou 0948 1367 0626 1311 5174 2623 2845], who 
made a special trip to Algeria to attend the ceremony, wrote in 
the visitors book: ``May the flower of nuclear science and 
technology jointly cultivated by China and Algeria bear rich 
fruit soon.'' After learning of the meaning of Li Dingfan's 
inscription, (Madani), spokesman and director of the information 
department of the Algerian Foreign Ministry, said: The 
inscription fully reflects the aspirations of the Algerian 
people and Chinese people, and the project which symbolizes 
Algerian-Chinese friendship will surely further promote friendly 
cooperation between the two countries.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan. 18 (YONHAP) -- The Golf II class 
submarines that the Russian fleet is selling to North Korea can 
carry ballistic missiles, Western defense analysts in Moscow 
said Tuesday. 
  A senior officer of the Russian Pacific Fleet was quoted as 
saying that Russia signed a contract with Pyongyang to sell 10 
Golf II submarines in a report in a Japanese newspaper Sunday. 
  The Golf II class was outfitted by the Russian Navy with 
ballistic missiles and North Korea could load its recently 
modified Nodong-1 scud missiles on the submarines if they were 
delivered intact, the analysts said. 
  Golf II submarines were manufactured until the late 1980s 
and 
are an improvement on the Fox-Trot class vessels already sold to 
North Korea and excel the submarines currently owned by the 
communist country, they said. 
  Russian Navy officers say the submarines were sold on 
condition that they are used for scrap, but North Korea may try 
to recycle them for military purposes. 
  The Russian Defense Ministry kept silence on the submarine 
kind and sales condition on Monday, but denied a report by the 
TOKYO SHIMBUN. 
  The Foreign Ministry acknowledged the contract to South 
Korean diplomats in Moscow, but assured them that the submarines 
were sold as scrap like ordinary exports. 
  It has not been revealed whether Russia was selling just the 
hulls or included the engines, and it is a serious matter if the 
latter were included, the defense analysts said. 
  Navy public relations officers affirmed that the submarines 
to be sold to North Korea would be dismantled under the 
observation of Russian military experts so that they cannot be 
used for anything but scrap. 
  But as its submarines are outdated and obtaining spare parts 
is very difficult, North Korea may cannibalize the Russian 
submarines to use the parts in their own submarines, the 
analysts said. 
  Because the Golf II and Fox-Trot classes are more modern 
than 
its submarines, North Korea's submarine technology will improve 
even if the Russian vessels arrive dismantled, they said. 
  Japan is said to be seriously worried because the Golf II 
submarines can carry ballistic missiles. In addition to the 10 
Golf II submarines, Russia has sold and delivered four Fox-Trot 
types to North Korea, according to the TOKYO SHIMBUN.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] At 1245 on 1 October, Mr. 
Phaithun Kaeothong, deputy minister of labor and social welfare, 
issued a statement concerning the 1 October announcement by the 
United States that it will bomb the chemical weapons plant in 
Libya, which could affect the Thai laborers in Libya. He said 
that the U.S. report stated that there are 200 Thai laborers 
working at that chemical weapons plant. The three employment 
agencies that sent the workers were the S.P.C. Suphachok 
Company, the W. and M. Associates Company, and the Handle Group 
Company. The Ministry of Labor has placed the S.P.C. Suphachok 
Company on the black list. The other two companies are illegal 
companies that have never registered, and officials have been 
ordered to take action against them. 
  "There is no cause for concern among Thai workers in Libya, 
because we have ordered the Thai labor attache in Greece to look 
after the laborers in Libya. Officials have information on the 
bombing targets and will immediately evacuate the Thai laborers 
to safe spots. That chemical weapons plant is located in Rafta. 
So far we have not been able to make contact, because Libya has 
refused to grant visas to officials. And those that have been 
allowed into the country have been restricted with respect to 
where they can go, making it difficult to meet with the Thai 
laborers. But the Thai-language service of the BBC radio has 
contacted those Thai laborers and told them to find a way to 
leave the munitions plant. The Ministry of Labor has prepared 
evacuation measures and has submitted a request to the cabinet 
for 200 million baht to pay for this," said Mr. Phaithun. He 
added that Thai workers continue to go to Libya to work. But 
employment companies have been told that if they send workers to 
work in munitions plants, their permits will be revoked 
immediately. The Ministry of Labor has a list of all employment 
companies and knows which companies are doing what. 
  Dr. Bun Wanasin, an adviser to the minister of labor said 
that at present the situation in Libya is not serious. That 
threat made by the United States is just an attempt by the 
United States to put pressure on Libya to turn over the two 
terrorists. The United States is not expected to bomb Libya for 
at least two weeks, and Libya has not made any preparations 
because it is still negotiating with the United States. [passage 
omitted] 
  At 1630 hours that same day at the Labor Skills Development 
Department, police officials from the Suppression Division took 
a number of suspects and a large number of documents concerning 
illegal job placement and turned them over to the 
director-general of the department. 
  After reviewing the documents, Mr. Sinchai Riantrakun, 
deputy 
director-general of the Labor Skills Development Department, 
said that General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, minister of labor, 
ordered the department to cooperate with officials from the 
Suppression Division and special operations units in searching 
the offices of the Handle Group Company Ltd. located at 119/265 
Sukhaphiban Road. There, they found job applications, pictures 
of the workers, money orders that the job applicants had given 
to the company, money orders for agent fees, airplane tickets, 
119 passports, and labor contracts from Libyan employers. Some 
of these documents were fakes that had been copied from the 
Labor Employment Department. The officials arrested Mrs. 
Sisuphat Hongthong, Mr. Suchat Hongthong, Mr. Suphot Phetmunwai, 
and Mr. Narong Yingsap and charged them with placing laborers 
without first obtaining permission from the registrar. These 
people are all company officials. The owners of this company, 
Mr. Chatchai Hongthong and Mrs. Arak Phinrat, managed to escape. 
Officials are now looking for them. 
  Mr. Sinchai said that during the interrogation, the company 
officials said that the company had been sending workers to 
Libya for 2 to 3 years. Their fee was 30-40,000 baht per person. 
On the application, it stated that the workers would be employed 
as mechanics, welders, blacksmiths, concrete workers, and 
physicians' assistants. But it hasn't been confirmed that this 
company was sending laborers to work at the chemical weapons 
plant in Libya as American officials have stated. The suspects 
will have to be questioned further, and the data on the large 
number of disks will have to be studied. 
  "I want to stress that this action was taken in accord with 
the labor employment law. Employers in Libya probably understand 
this. This should not have any effect on our international 
relations, because this action was taken in accord with Thai 
laws. The illegal labor issue is a major problem today. The 
Labor Employment Department will take resolute action in 
investigating matters. Those who find jobs for people abroad 
must do things in accord with the law," said Mr. Sinchai. He 
added that these violations are criminal violations for which 
people can be imprisoned for up to ten years and fined 60,000 to 
200,000 baht.

  [Excerpts] On 30 September, Mr. Sakthip Krairuk, 
director-general of the Information Department, Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, said that the UN Security Council may impose an 
embargo on Libya. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Sakthip said that besides this, the government has taken 
steps to have the Labor Skills Development Department issue 
stipulations prohibiting Thai workers from engaging in 
activities abroad having to do with the production, stockpiling, 
and use of chemical weapons. 
  "The Thai government supports the attempt by the people of 
the world to limit the spread of chemical weapons. On 13 March, 
the government implemented a royal decree on controlling 
shipments out of the country in order to prevent the shipment of 
chemicals and implements that could be used to produce chemical 
weapons," said Mr. Sakthip. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The American charge d' affaires met with General 
Chawalit Yongchaiyut, the minister of interior, and said that 
there are 200 Thai laborers working in chemical and nuclear 
weapons plants in Libya. After that, Mr. Suthat Ngoenmun, the 
deputy minister of interior, admitted that there are Thai 
workers employed at those plants. But he said that they are 
engaged in laying pipes to produce clean water. The Labor Skills 
Development Department was then ordered to draft a ministry 
regulation prohibiting Thai laborers from being sent to work at 
foreign munitions plants. In just 3 to 4 days, the Labor Skills 
Development Department submitted a draft regulation to the 
ministry's legal section. But the resolution was not approved, 
because it was felt that the present labor law does not give the 
ministry authority in such cases. However, the director-general 
of the Labor Skills Development Department already has the 
authority to prohibit this. There is no need to issue a ministry 
regulation. 
  Last week, Mrs. Amphon Chunnanon, the director-general of 
the 
Labor Skills Development Department, told reporters that after 
it became clear that a ministry regulation couldn't be issued, 
the department issued an order prohibiting Thai workers from 
being sent to work at a foreign munitions plant regardless of 
the type of weapons produced there. This prohibition does not 
apply just to Libya but to all countries. It is difficult to say 
how effective this will be. Normally, employment companies 
declare that they are sending workers to perform one type of 
job, but they may actually perform some other job. The 
department can't follow them to see what they are actually 
doing. Furthermore, a large number of workers have gone abroad 
to work without going through the Labor Skills Development 
Department. This is a major problem today. Those laborers may be 
working at plants where we do not want them to work. 
  Unfortunately, the director-general of the Labor Skills 
Development Department did not state frankly that prohibiting 
workers from working at foreign munitions plants is aimed simply 
at sucking up to the Americans. Actually, it will be difficult 
to prohibit workers from doing that.

  [Excerpts] There have long been rumors that the "air raid 
shelter" in Libya is being modified so that it can serve as a 
large nuclear and chemical weapons production plant, weapons 
that could virtually destroy the human race. Thus, this tunnel 
is very troubling to the people of the world. 
  These rumors got started in the West, particularly in the 
United States, the enemy of Libya's leader, Qadhdhafi. There 
have also been reports that Thai engineers designed this nuclear 
weapons plant. And there are more than 60 Thai laborers working 
on this tunnel. [passage omitted] 
  Police Major General Luan Panarotsathip, the commander of 
the 
Suppression Division, ordered Police Colonel Chaloemchat 
Sittanon, the deputy commander, and Police Colonel Chumphon 
Manmai, the superintendent of Precinct 2, to coordinate things 
with the Labor Skills Development Department in order to conduct 
an investigation. 
  A few days later, police officials checked the people at 
that 
company. It was suspected that this was an engineering company 
that was involved in sending Thai laborers to work in Libya. The 
police detained four officials at the Suppression Division and 
seized a number of documents. [passage omitted] 
  On the morning of 14 October, Police Colonel Chumphon and a 
team of officials raided a condominium located at 13/1 
Nimmanmoen, Lane 12, Suthep Subdistrict, Chiang Mai City. The 
offices of the W and M Company Ltd. were located there. When the 
police rushed in so early in the morning, Mr. Wirot 
Sakunmuthita, the owner of the company, looked very bewildered, 
and the more than ten workers there all wondered what was 
happening. 
  "What the hell is going on," said Mr. Wirot looking at the 
police officials. Focusing on Chumphon Manmai, who had entered 
the office ahead of the other police officials, he asked, "Do 
you have a search warrant?" 
  "We have both a search warrant and a warrant for your 
arrest," said Police Col. Chumphon, taking out the warrants for 
him to see. Mr. Wirot's attitude softened, and he tried to ask 
what was going on. He asked why the police wanted to search his 
company. When informed that officials believe that this company 
is sending workers to work abroad without authorization, Mr. 
Wirot angrily said that "this is clearly a political matter." 
  But even though Mr. Wirot made a scene, the police began 
searching the offices, which were filled with modern equipment. 
They were particularly interested in the ten computers and 
computer disks. Wirot just stood there complaining, saying that 
"the United States probably put pressure on you to do this." 
  In the end, the Suppression Division officials seized three 
computer disks and a number of documents concerning the 
operations of this company. After that, the police escorted Mr. 
Wirot to his house at 65/7 Sirorot Road, Lane 1, Suthep 
Subdistrict, and found 158 disks containing information on 
sending laborers from the north to work in Libya. They also 
found receipts and expenditures journals. 
  The police charged Mr. Wirot with hiring Thai laborers and 
sending them to work abroad without authorization. Mr. Wirot 
admitted that he was the owner of the W and M Company Ltd., and 
said that he was the engineer who had designed that tunnel in 
Libya. 
  Libya awarded the contract to build this tunnel to the 
M.N.C. 
Company Ltd. Construction got underway two years ago. It is 
thought that construction will be completed within another year. 
This tunnel is about 17 meters wide and about 110 meters long. 
Wirot was paid 25 million baht to draw up the plans and oversee 
the construction. The Libyan government has invested 
approximately 700-800 million baht in building this tunnel. 
  And they plan to build several more tunnels! 
  Mr. Wirot denied knowing anything about this. And he said 
that he isn't interested in what Libya plans to do with the 
tunnels once they are completed. He said that he doesn't know if 
they will use them as air raid shelters or sites for nuclear and 
chemical weapons plants. But Wirot has to fly to Libya about 
twice a month. 
  A report from an intelligence unit stated that the situation 
concerning the construction of chemical and nuclear weapons 
production plants in Libya is expanding, particularly in Lotta 
and Banghazi, which are located about 10 hours away from 
Tripoli, the capital. Those plants are located in valleys with 
an area of more than 1,000 rai and in underground tunnels. There 
are at least nine such plants. 
  Most of the chemicals are sent directly from Germany. It's 
said that if these chemicals come in contact with the air, they 
will immediately burst into flames. If applied to steel, this 
chemical can quickly melt the steel. They now have about 120 
tanks of this chemical, with each tank weighing 40 tons. Because 
of its great concern about this, the United States is closely 
monitoring the construction of these tunnels in Libya. 
  Police officials are very suspicious about the role played 
by 
Mr. Wirot. They wonder who he is exactly and how he managed to 
gain a monopoly on the construction of these tunnels. 
  Another question that the police must answer concerns the 
relationship between the engineer who drew up the plans, that 
is, Wirot, and a Thai engineer who studied in Germany and who is 
an expert on chemicals. The police wonder how important he is in 
the construction of these tunnels. 
  The United States has charged that these tunnels are being 
modified so that they can serve as plants for producing nuclear 
and chemical weapons, mankind's most destructive weapons.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has said that 
Ukraine was, to all intents and purposes, a nuclear state since 
its parliament had virtually not ratified the strategic arms 
reduction treaty (START-1). 
  In late 1993 the Ukrainian parliament ratified the Start-1 
treaty, but with reservations which changed its essence. 
  Meeting in Moscow Wednesday well-known political leaders, 
U.S. Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, the Russian Minister 
said that presence of nuclear arms on the territory of Ukraine 
would be discussed at the Moscow summit January 12 between 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his U.S. counterpart Bill 
Clinton. 
  Grachev believes taking part in the summit will be Ukrainian 
leader Leonid Kravchuk who will give a certain impetus to the 
possible solution. 
  Nuclear weapons, believes the Minister, cannot be a subject 
of bargaining. This is dangerous, said Grachev. 
  He said he has a hot line with U.S. Defense Secretary Les 
Aspin [as received]. 
  Grachev has said on Wednesday, at 16:00 he intends to 
discuss 
with his U.S. counterpart acute security problems.

  [Text] The disruption of connections between the nuclear 
supervision services of Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania may lead 
to the most undesirable effects in the sphere of radiation and 
nuclear safety, the head of the press office of the Russian 
Goskomatomnadzor (state committee for supervising nuclear 
installations), Yuriy Rogozhin, told INTERFAX today. 
  Rogozhin said his committee's leadership knew of the 
accident 
at the 4th reactor of the Zaporozhskaya nuclear power station in 
Ukraine on January 12 only five days later from a fax from the 
European Nuclear Society HQ in Switzerland to Moscow. 
  Rogozhin said Russia received information on the accident on 
the Ignalina nuclear power station in Lithuania only from the 
press. 
  He pointed out that failures to provide the necessary 
information to the Russian Goskomatomnadzor by former Soviet 
republics run counter to the official agreement between the 
nuclear supervision organizations which was reached shortly 
after the break-up of the Soviet Union. 
  According to Rogozhin, the Ignalina nuclear power station 
was 
equipped with reactors of type RBMK-1500, which are identical to 
those that were installed in Chernobyl. With the lack of 
information, it is difficult to speak of the maintenance of 
nuclear safety. 
  Rogozhin pointed to the fact that reactors functioning now 
in 
former Soviet republics are made in Russia, and Moscow must be 
fully informed of even the most insignificant accidents.

<F P=106> [By reporter A. Portov; first paragraph is newspaper's </F>
introduction] 
  [Text] The Russian Pacific Fleet is likely to resume 
dumping into the sea liquid nuclear waste, the product repairs 
to nuclear-powered submarines. Despite Japan's emergency plan 
to stop the dumping, the resumption is likely to go ahead 
because Russia does not have enough nuclear waste treatment 
facilities and is being urged to promote the mass dismantling of 
nuclear-powered submarines in accordance with the second 
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II). Reporter Portov 
recently obtained information from several high-ranking Pacific 
Fleet officers about nuclear-powered submarines, nuclear weapons 
facilities near Vladivostok, and Russia's handling of nuclear 
waste disposal. 
  "The graveyard of holdovers from the East-West Cold War era" 
is now in a terrible condition and out of control. Portov 
reports on the current situation in an area of Russia which 
foreigners are still forbidden to enter. 
  Vladivostok -- The Bolshoy Kamen Bay, the Cape of Maidel 
[name as published], and the Strelok Bay are located between 
Vladivostok and Nakhodka. The Pacific Fleet's nuclear 
weapons-related facilities, such as nuclear-powered submarine 
bases, underground nuclear warhead storage sites, docks designed 
to handle nuclear- powered craft, and nuclear waste treatment 
facilities are concentrated in the area. Foreigners are 
prohibited from entering. 
  Nuclear waste yielded at Zvezda nuclear-powered submarine 
dock, which is located in the Bolshoy Kamen Bay, is the 
radioactive liquid at issue in Russian plans to dump waste into 
the Sea of Japan. About 20 nuclear-powered submarines are 
currently under repair in the dock. There are also four nuclear 
reactors in the dock from disassembled submarines. The reactors 
are known as "cigarette butts." 
  Many of the repairs are made upon the nuclear reactors 
involved. Repeated cleaning of the reactors' external circuits 
with cooling water produces a large amount of radioactive waste 
liquid. In addition, nuclear-powered submarines in the Zvezda 
dock are equipped with SLBM [submarine launched ballistic 
missile] launchers, the numbers of which are due to be reduced 
in accordance with START II. 
  As far as START II is concerned, Russia plans to dismantle 
eight of the submarines currently in the dock. Also, before the 
end of the year, it will move a 365-class nuclear-powered 
submarine equipped with a SLBM launcher from Russia's largest 
submarine base on the Kamchatka Peninsula to the Zvezda dock for 
dismantling. 
  There are two nuclear waste discharge ships in the Zvezda 
dock. They are "TNT-5" and "TNT-27." Both are currently full of 
radioactive liquids. 
  Another reason Russia is in haste to dump nuclear waste into 
the Sea of Japan and other waters is the delay in its 
procurement of new nuclear waste discharge ships. The 
procurement was proposed at a nuclear waste council meeting held 
at the Pacific Fleet headquarters on 5 December. Because the 
Russian Government is currently in difficult financial 
conditions and because such ships are built in Ukraine, 
immediate construction and procurement of the ships is unlikely. 
Nevertheless, a high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer at 
headquarters said: "If we have new ships, we can dump nuclear 
waste not only into the Sea of Japan but also into waters 
further away in the Pacific. But...." His remarks made it 
clear that the only option left to Russia was marine dumping of 
nuclear waste, which is banned under the London Convention. 
  Another reason is one that has greatly irritate officers at 
the fleet headquarters in charge of dumping nuclear waste. The 
Pacific Fleet owns at least 14 support ships, of which four 
could be refitted to become nuclear waste storage ships. 
However, to make money, all 14 have been leased to 
newly-established corporations by former Pacific Fleet Commander 
Furatov [name as published], who was dismissed from his post in 
the spring, and other high-ranking officers. The ships are 
currently being used for commercial purposes. 
  The headquarters' prosecution bureau is interrogating about 
15 former high-ranking officers, including Furatov, on suspicion 
of having "illegally leased the support ships." Nevertheless, 
because of the lease contracts, it will be impossible to refit 
them as nuclear waste discharge ships in the near future. 
  There is another nuclear-submarine dock at Chazima Bay [name 
as published] in the off-limits zone. Called No. 30 dock, it is 
currently closed, and falls under direct control of Russian 
Naval headquarters. In 1985 there was an accident at the dock 
which killed eight people. There was a blast from a nuclear 
reactor due to a rapid rise in the temperature of cooling water 
which occurred when the reactor was opened for repair. 
  It is believed that when Russia resumes nuclear waste 
dumping 
it will use ships at the Zvezda dock, such as "TNT-5," but will 
probably move them to No. 30 dock to elude the vigilance of 
other countries. It is thought the ships will then leave No. 30 
dock to dump nuclear waste or they will be scuttled in the near 
seas. 
  There is a solid nuclear waste dumping site and an 
underground nuclear weapons storage depot at the Cape of Maidel. 
This dumping site is also full of nuclear waste. It is said 
that Russia has many times dumped nuclear waste from the site 
into the Sea of Japan and other waters. 
  Reactors from dismantled nuclear-powered submarines 
represent 
the most troublesome aspect of handling solid nuclear waste. 
They are called "cigarette butts." 
  A high-ranking Pacific Fleet officer said: "The Northern 
Fleet has also disposed of cigarette butts in the waters off the 
Kolskiy Peninsula in the Barents Sea. If Russia dismantles more 
nuclear- powered submarines in accordance with START II, the 
Pacific Fleet may also have to start dumping its cigarette butts 
into the sea." 
  There is a nuclear-powered submarine base and an underground 
nuclear warhead storage center in Pavlovsk in Strelok Bay. The 
submarine base is the largest in the Maritime Kray. In the bay 
there are two abandoned sunken submarines.

  [Text] The works to destroy chemical weapons on the test 
site in Shikhany, Saratov region, seriously damage the health of 
people who live there, according to the former senior research 
official of the Volsk Scientific and Research Institute of 
Organic Chemistry, Vladimir Uglyov. 
  The town of Volsk is situated a few dozen kilometers away 
from Shikhany, which hosts a test site of the Defense Ministry. 
At the moment, the Moscow city court is conducting closed 
hearings of the case of another former employee of the same 
institute, Vil Mirzayanov, accused of revealing confidential 
information on the production of chemical weapons in Russia. 
  Uglyov said the weapons were destroyed in Shikhany by 
burying 
in the ground. Substances containing arsenic, in particular 
lewisite, were simply dumped into pits dug especially for this 
purpose. Such substances are supposed to lose their poisonous 
features in a short period of time. 
  "However, the background level of arsenic in the region 
exceeds the maximum limit three times," Uglyov said. From 
August 1992 to August 1993, the number of illnesses went up by 
1.8 times in the region, he said. Uglyov pointed out that the 
test site was situated not far from the river Volga and did not 
rule out the possibility of the poisonous substances' leakages 
into the water. 
  The scientist said he had never received a response to his 
repeated appeals to the president and government to take 
measures to improve the ecological situation in the region. He 
pointed out that he had worked on the development of chemical 
weapons for 15 years. 
  "If the detrimental consequences of the destruction of 
chemical weapons remain ignored, I will make public the 
poisonous substances' formulas and names, sources of raw 
materials, techniques of their manufacturing and combat use," 
Uglyov said. He said he was doing that only to draw everyone's 
attention to the health of people residing in the Saratov region.

  [Text] In his interview with Interfax on Saturday head of 
Belarus' Foreign Ministry Petr Kravchenko declared that Belarus 
hopes to solve the issue on a just monetary compensation for 
uranium to be extracted from nuclear warheads, which Russia 
intends to sell to America, during U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
visit to Minsk. 
  He explained that "in contrast to Ukraine, Belarus does not 
claim for low enriched uranium which is used as fuel for atomic 
power stations. We have no nuclear reactors and power plants. 
Belarus pretends for monetary compensation for this uranium -- 
he underlined -- the American party has given its backing to 
this approach and President Clinton will fix it legally." 
  In Kravchenko's words, the draft of a corresponding 
agreement 
which is expected to be signed on Saturday in Minsk stipulates 
that "Russia will not be able to sell low enriched uranium to 
the United States without preliminary coordination with Belarus, 
Ukraine, and Kazakhstan," said Kravchenko. 
  According to the minister, the visit of the American 
president to Minsk is a historic event. "The visit has broken 
Belarus' obscurity in the world once and for ever. From now on 
Belarus has a chance to be represented in the world as a small 
democratic civilized state with its deep national traditions," 
he said. 
  Kravchenko believes that the Belarusian-American summit 
"helps to correct the disbalance which has been in our bilateral 
relations." "Earlier cooperation between two countries was 
restricted to military strategic problems and problems of 
refugees," he said. 
  The minister stressed the importance of the treaty on 
security of American investments in the Belarusian economy which 
is to be signed in the course of Clinton's visit to Minsk. 
  According to the republican Foreign Ministry, in 1993 the 
volume of turnover between Belarus and United States was $125 
Mn. "In 1994 this number will increase by 10 times after 
signing of the treaty," believes the minister. 
  He reminded that in February 1993 Belarus was granted the 
most favored nation regime in trade with the United States. "It 
means that tariffs higher than common ones will not be imposed 
on deliveries of Belarusian goods to the United States. In 
addition, in some cases Belarusian goods will be entirely 
relieved of any customs tariffs," indicated Kravchenko. 
  In his words, Belarus hopes to receive an assistance from 
the 
United States totalling "several tens of million dollars in 
addition to those $76 [figure as received] as it has already 
received according to the Nunn-Lugar law." "This funds will be 
channelled to prevent transportation of contraband uranium from 
Russia to the Western Europe by transit via Belarus and to solve 
export problems and to re-train retired officers," he said.

  [Text] Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy has 
completed an inspection of strategic units and missile sites. 
  "The state of missile installations is satisfactory. We are 
doing all we can and more to protect and safely store nuclear 
warheads and provide strategic forces with everything they need." 
  He reports in a statement, released by the republic's 
Defense 
Ministry, that he visited a depot for nuclear warheads, removed 
from missiles, and says that the purpose of his mission was to 
impartially assess the state of nuclear sites. 
  He notes that he checked all nuclear sites at the 
president's 
request and in line with a special program. 
  "We have enough problems to resolve on the threshold of 
negotiations with Russia on these issues." He revealed plans 
for early talks with his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev to 
discuss a whole set of documents. "What's most important for 
Ukraine and Russia is eagerness to work hard toward nuclear 
disarmament," Radetskyy stressed, and warned against dramatizing 
the situation, as some journalists and politicians do. 
  Meanwhile, the Commander of Ukraine's 43 Strategic Missile 
Troops Army Vladimir Migtyuk has admitted that "technical 
maintenance problems really exist." However, in his words, 
"there is no reason to lay it on thick." "Nuclear facilities 
are fully under control, he assured, we have all means for 
that." He dismissed as far- fetched attempts to draw a parallel 
to Chernobyl or anything else. 
  The Ukrainian Air-Force Commander Valeriy Vasilyev has 
announced that the nuclear warheads on board strategic aircraft 
"are reliably protected." He refuted allegations that their 
condition was appalling. 
  Colonel Valeriy Izmalkov, a member of the Parliamentary 
Commission on Defence and Security Affairs dismissed as 
"absolutely baseless" some foreign assertions that Ukraine will 
declassify the operative missile management codes in the coming 
months. 
  In his words, these codes are not possible to declassify. 
Only U.S. and Russian Headquarters could re-target missiles 
after making essential calculations. "Ukraine is not ready for 
that," Izmalkov remarked.

  [Text] By the middle of December Ukraine had removed from 
operational service 17 nuclear SS-24 missiles and detached the 
warheads from the delivery medium, the Ukrainian Vice Premier 
for the Military-Industrial Complex, Valeriy Shmarov, told 
INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  We hope that our partners in nuclear arms negotiations will 
appreciate this unilateral step, he said. Shmarov said that the 
deactivation of missiles was a labor-intense process, however, 
Ukraine was well aware of that, when it made the decision. The 
Vice Premier said that in 1994 the rest of the SS-24 missiles 
stationed in Ukraine must be deactivated. 
  Shmarov also said that Russian experts continued to service 
nuclear warheads in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Vice Premier 
dismissed as populist and senseless the Russian government's 
statement to the effect that such servicing had been stopped. 
  In the course of trilateral talks, American, Ukrainian and 
Russian delegates had in Kiev last week progress was achieved in 
resolving the problem of Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, Shmarov 
said. For instance, he said, the question of compensation to 
Ukraine for the tactical nuclear arms removed earlier, became 
specific. For instance, Ukraine said it would agree to accept a 
smaller compensation, if Russia were to write off Ukraine's debt 
to it. 
  The sides achieved understanding on the need to hand over to 
Ukraine enriched uranium in exchange for nuclear warheads. 
Shmarov said that Ukrainian experts had computed the amount. 
"Probably that uranium will be processed and handed over to the 
United States under a Russian-US contract," Shmarov said. 
  The United States Deputy Defence Secretary William Perry is 
reported to have said during the talks that Washington was 
considering an additional 400 million dollars in compensation to 
Ukraine for nuclear disarmament. 
  So far the United States has given Ukraine 175 million 
dollars under the Nunn-Lugar amendment in technical and other 
assistance for removing nuclear missiles from Ukraine.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F>
Diplomatic Correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, 
Vitaliy Trubetskoi and others] 
  [Text] During a three-sided meeting of the presidents of 
Russia, Ukraine and the United States in Moscow, not all issues, 
if any, concerning nuclear weapons in Ukraine are likely to be 
cleared up. The only thing Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine can do is 
to confirm unambiguously to Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton his 
republic's international commitments on nuclear disarmament and 
promise to submit again the START-I treaty for ratification by 
the new parliament. 
  This statement was made to INTERFAX Wednesday by a senior 
Russian diplomat responsible for Russian-Ukrainian relations. 
  He believes that the likely three-sided summit may present a 
good opportunity for Kravchuk to distance himself in public from 
the partial ratification of the treaty. 
  The diplomat has said the United States promised to Ukraine 
financial aid worth $170 Mn as soon as the disarmament process 
begins. 
  The Americans are practically-minded people. They will not 
give money to Ukraine for mere promises, he said.

  [Text] The Moscow deal on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons 
from Ukrainian soil is part of "President Kravchuk's defeatist 
policy," member of the parliamentary commission for defence and 
security matters Igor Derkach told Interfax on Saturday. 
  He says the agreement is not likely to be implemented given 
further economic recession in Ukraine. 
  Derkach pointed to a lack of convincing arguments in 
statements by the American and Russian leaders about security 
guarantees and technical assistance to Ukraine. "The $175 Mn 
aid to Ukraine the Americans promised a long time ago will be 
used to pay U.S. experts," he said. 
  The dismantling and transfer of long-range missiles from 
Ukraine to Russia will cost $3 Bn, according to the estimates 
local experts made prior to the ratification of the Start I 
agreement by Ukrainian deputies.

  [Text] On January 20, the Ukrainian parliament will gather 
for a session to evaluate the moves by President Kravchuk, who 
signed the document on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament, member of 
the Ukrainian parliament's Presidium and a leader of the Popular 
Rukh, Les Tanyuk, told INTERFAX-Ukraine. 
  Tanyuk announced that according to his sources, "Kravchuk is 
planning a big conflict with the parliament. The parliament may 
be dissolved," he said. He believes that in such a situation 
new parliamentary elections may not be held. 
  Ukraine signed the Moscow agreement "on its knees," said 
Tanyuk. This agreement cannot be implemented because Kravchuk is 
only planning to ask experts to make corresponding estimates. 
Tanyuk described such actions as "anti-state," and carried out 
under the pressure of forces which are not interested in 
Ukraine's development.

<F P=106> [Article by Alma Pizzi: "The European Community Gets Ready </F>
for a `Clean' Fusion Reactor"] 
  [Text] The International Conference on Materials for 
Fusion Reactors, organized by the EC Commission and the Advanced 
Materials Institute of the Joint Research Center at Ispra 
(Varese), was held in Stresa, Italy. This was the sixth edition 
of the biennial conference following those held in Tokyo, 
Chicago, Karlsruhe, Kyoto, and Clearwater. 
  One of the short-term objectives of the EC is the 
construction of an experimental reactor as part of global 
cooperation. It will be based on the magnetic confinement of 
deuterium and tritium plasma, followed by the design and 
construction of a demonstration reactor. 
  The experimental fusion reactor, named ITER [International 
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor], is to be built around the 
year 2000 and already involves major research efforts into 
materials, subjected to the extreme service conditions which 
cause their deterioration. 
  The international conference in Stresa, attended by 400 
scientists from 23 countries (for the first time there was a 
major delegation from Russia), examined the mechanisms of 
degradation and the remedies for expanding the working potential 
of materials for fusion reactors. 
  More specifically materials can be developed which, though 
becoming partially radioactive due to the neutrons generated by 
the fusion process, will be able to lose their radioactivity 
gradually within 20-30 years. By using this type of material 
the energy generated by the fusion process may become clean.

  [Text] All is not entirely well with the transatlantic 
alliance between Space Systems/Loral, Aerospatiale, Alcatel 
Espace, Alenia Spazio and Deutsche Aerospace. There appears to 
be some big divisions amongst the members who are grouped 
together to develop and market satellites. 
  -- Deutsche Aerospace (Prime contractor), Aerospatiale and 
Alenia Spazio are partners in Argentina for the Nahuel system; 
Alcatel Espace decided not to participate in this venture. 
Space Systems/Loral did not show a much interest in Nahuel 
either. 
  -- Alenia Spazio, instead of using and promoting the 
Spacebus 
platform for the ESA [European Space Agency] Artemis and DRS 
[Data Relay System] spacecraft, will develop a new bus with the 
financial support of the Italian government. 
  -- Deutsche Aerospace (MBB, at Munich) is forming a 
German-Chinese venture to develop applications satellites for 
China; the other partners of the "Space Alliance" are not 
involved in this industrial agreement. 
  -- Aerospatiale is cooperating with Matra Marconi Space in a 
joint proposal for the second generation of Meteosat weather 
satellites; there are some serious discussions between the 
public sector Aerospatiale and private Matra Marconi Space to 
upgrade industrial cooperation in the field of space systems.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yves Petroff, director of the European </F>
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, by unidentified questioner: "The 
Best Source in the World" -- date and place not given] 
  [Text] [SCIENCES ET AVENIR] The synchrotron is working, the 
very first experiments are taking shape; what is your 
appreciation of the qualities of the ESRF [European Synchrotron 
Radiation Facility]? 
  Petroff: Our machine will be the best synchrotron 
radiation source in the world for several years to come. A 
machine of equivalent efficiency will only be available in 
another three years' time in the United States (in Argonne, with 
a 7-GeV [giga-electron Volt] synchrotron) and in four years' 
time in Japan (the 8-GeV Spring Height facility). Current tests 
show that we have exceeded our aims in terms of beam quality: 
duration (27 hours instead of the forecast eight), intensity 
and brilliance, stability, and availability. The ESRF 
represents a real leap forward for European research workers. 
We are going through a very exciting period offering new 
prospects in physics and new fields of exploration. 
  SCIENCES ET AVENIR: What are your forthcoming 
deadlines? 
  Petroff: We are now installing the first of the 30 
high- performance synchrotron light lines, fed by undulators and 
wigglers which make the electrons oscillate and make it possible 
to multiply the brilliance of the beam by up to 1,000 times. We 
will open eight lines in September 1994, 10 lines a year later. 
They will on the whole be used by the scientific communities of 
the 12 countries which built the ESRF. To date, decisions have 
been made on 23 lines out of a possible 29 or 30, although some 
have been frozen for a year due to an 8-percent budget cut. 
Other light lines will be installed on curvature magnets and 
purchased by organizations or countries which will have 
two-thirds of the beam time, the other third being reserved for 
the use of the ESRF. Five have already been allocated and are 
being installed (Italy, Switzerland/Norway, two for France, and 
another Italian line for an original nuclear physics 
experiment). There are therefore a dozen remaining. In all, we 
will have between 45 and 47 lines. 
  SCIENCES ET AVENIR: Who will come to work at the 
ESRF? 
  Petroff: There are many potential users; Europe is 
strong in this field. The first users will be the ESRF's 
researchers, who will be in charge of specialized-light lines. 
Of course they will play host to teams, but they will also have 
their own research subjects. You will not get good people if 
they can not carry out their own work. You do not develop a new 
piece of equipment, a detector, unless you yourself have an idea 
for an experiment in mind. This is the only way to avoid 
stagnation. Working at full capacity, the installation will be 
able to host around 220 research workers per week (the average 
duration of an experiment). We hope to have the machine working 
for 6,000 hours per year, in other words round the clock for 
over eight months. Between 2,000 and 2,500 researchers will be 
able to share this time, which will be allocated by program 
committees mostly made up of scientists from outside the 
facility on the basis of the scientific interest of the 
experiments proposed, but avoiding too great a distortion 
between the country's share of the funding and the time 
allocated. 
  SCIENCES ET AVENIR: To what scientific advances 
can we look forward? 
  Petroff: The quality of the source is such that it 
makes it possible to envisage experiments which have been 
impossible until now. We have been able to focus the optical 
beam down to an area measuring a few square microns. We are now 
able to reproduce in the laboratory pressures of 2 million 
atmospheres, which are found at the center of the Earth or on 
some planets. However, this means working on volumes of a few 
cubic microns...hence the optical beam of a few square microns. 
Our aim is thus to tackle experiments where the material to be 
studied is of a very small size. This is often the case of 
protein crystals, of which the study by diffraction will be one 
of the ESRF's major tasks for the coming years. We have also 
been able to show that if a monochromatic beam from one of the 
ESRF's undulators is passed through a hole three microns in 
diameter, it becomes extremely coherent, featuring properties 
similar to those of a laser with a wavelength in the visible 
spectrum. This opens up new possibilities for research into 
phase transitions in alloys, surfaces, and liquids.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nuclear Safety - Development of EU </F>
Assistance to Eastern Europe and Ex-USSR"; as released by 
Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] In conjunction with President Clinton's talks in 
Brussels and Moscow, the European Commission has made a point of 
recalling the essential role the EC plays within international 
efforts to boost nuclear safety in Eastern Europe and the former 
USSR. Information provided by the Commission reveals the 
following: 
  (a) Following the G-7 meeting in Munich in July 1992 (which 
should be considered the starting point of international 
assistance to improve nuclear safety because it gave rise to a 
multilateral action program and the decision in principle to 
create a multilateral fund of 700 million dollars), the EC 
accepted responsibility for coordinating implementation of the 
program agreed in Munich within the G-24. In early 1993, work 
to create the multilateral fund was concluded and its 
administration has been entrusted to the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development [EBRD]. Since the implementation 
of the Munich action program, a total of 506 assistance programs 
have been listed in the G-24 data bank, involving 16 donors 
(including the European Union), five international organizations 
and 15 beneficiary countries. These 506 programs involve a 
total of ECU461.25 million, of which more than 60 percent is 
provided directly by the EC (through its PHARE and TACIS 
programs) and by the member states; 
  (b) Regarding the organization of implementation of the 
Munich action program, the EC has contributed to a large measure 
in the achievement of several positive results, in particular: 
  - three working groups (Kozloduy, Training and Civil 
Liability) are fully operational, while three other issues 
(Slovakia, RMBK and Regulatory Authorities) are being handled in 
ad hoc working groups; 
  - institutional arrangements are fully operational (the 
Plenary Group meets twice a year and the Steering Committee four 
times a year). A secretariat has been established with the 
status of an independent unit within Directorate-General XI of 
the European Commission (it comprises European civil servants 
and national experts from Germany, Belgium, France, Japan, 
United Kingdom and Russia); 
  - the data bank has reached an advanced state of development 
and is now being used by the secretariat and members of the G-24 
as a tool for the administration of bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation. The system will be perfected soon so as to make 
distance access possible. Moreover, the secretariat's missions 
in Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria have made it possible to 
incorporate the data bank into national programs for the 
improvement of safety being developed in these countries without 
western assistance; 
  - information on projects underway is provided by means of a 
quarterly publication (NUSAC News). 
  (c) In addition to participation in decisionmaking and 
multilateral fund management bodies, the EC has established 
close technical cooperation between the G-24 secretariat and the 
EBRD secretariat (meetings are held regularly in Brussels). The 
Commission notes that this cooperation has already proved 
productive regarding the case of the nuclear power station in 
Kozloduy (Bulgaria), with approval of an initial project 
totalling ECU25 million on which the G-24 Kozloduy working group 
has issued a favorable technical opinion. An identical 
procedure is underway for the Ignalina station in Lithuania and 
will be used subsequently for a number of projects in Russia. 
  (d) Regarding the outlook for 1994, a stepped-up effort will 
be made to improve coordination of aid to beneficiary countries 
in the area of legal matters so as to establish international 
confidence facilitating the exchange of know-how. Two specific 
aspects will be the focus of this initiative: 
  - the development of an appropriate framework in terms of 
civil liability to enable western suppliers to more easily 
deliver equipment and material. The G-24 ad hoc group on civil 
liability will continue providing follow-up to national 
developments in nuclear law and will continue its contacts with 
the nuclear industry and the insurance sector; 
  - the development of legislation on intellectual property.

<TEXT>

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] In the spring of 1992, the French and U.S. 
Presidents decided to follow in the footsteps of the British and 
Russians by extending their countries' moratoria on nuclear 
tests. Those respective decisions had more to do with politics 
and diplomacy than with scientific or technological arguments. 
So one might well ask what the consequences of these decisions 
might be. 
  Firstly, nuclear weapons -- like conventional arms -- grow 
old. In other words, only detonating them can provide sufficient 
information on such problems of ageing to ensure that the armed 
forces concerned remain confident in their respective nuclear 
arsenals. 
  A second problem resides in the fact that France has not 
developed any new tactical weapons, especially when it comes to 
low- powered missiles. The United States is facing an entirely 
different problem, for it already has weapons of this type. 
Strategic experts believe that France, too, should have 
variable-energy arms, as well as the neutron bomb. Of course, 
those who oppose nuclear testing maintain that the same kind of 
information can be obtained through computer simulations. 
However, doing this requires vast computer programs which need 
the input of incredibly extensive databases compiled on the 
basis of previous tests. Yet, to our knowledge, French 
researchers do not have any such databases, unlike the 
Americans, no doubt, who naturally classify them as 
confidential. Furthermore, even if the performance of nuclear 
missiles could be simulated by computer, it would be difficult 
to estimate the damage caused by the electromagnetic shock 
generated at the moment of detonation. 
  A wave of this kind can destroy the electronic components of 
monitoring and tracking equipment. In this area, the United 
States has gathered extensive experience through underground 
tests. 
  We should also mention another argument advanced against 
resuming nuclear testing, namely the risk of radioactive 
pollution. However, in 1991 an international committee 
performed a series of measures at the French testing site in the 
Pacific and ended up finding no trace of radioactive elements 
that could have been produced by an explosion. 
  Finally, prolonging the moratorium would risk causing the 
best available researchers to lose interest in this kind of 
work. This would then result in a loss of know-how which would 
be very difficult to overcome when the decision to resume tests 
is made. These, then, are the problems that will have to be 
taken into account by the members of the working group jointly 
appointed by the French president and prime minister on 15 July 
1993 to "consider the effects on our nuclear capacity of the 
moratorium on nuclear testing." The working group, chaired by 
Admiral Lanxade, the French chief of staff, comprises two 
representatives of the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), two 
military figures, and the former research minister, H. Curien. 
Let us hope that despite the "wall of silence" surrounding the 
group's conclusions which are due to be submitted this month, 
the government will keep French citizens informed regarding the 
ultimate reasons behind the decisions that will surely have to 
be taken.

<F P=106> [Article by Bradford Smith: "France Hits the Re-Accelerator </F>
Pedal"] 
  [Text] The GANIL heavy-ion accelerator at Caen in France 
is to be upgraded at a cost of 120 million French francs (about 
14.8 million pounds) over the next six years. GANIL-plus will 
collect and sort radioactive ions produced in heavy-ion-target 
collisions by GANIL, and "re-accelerate" them to energies 
between 2 and 25 MeV [megaelectronvolt] per nucleon. These 
"radio-active beams" will be used in nuclear physics, 
astrophysics and materials science research. The upgrade was 
endorsed by the Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee 
(NuPECC) in May. 
  Work on GANIL-plus is expected to start almost immediately 
following an agreement signed in mid-October by Claude Detraz of 
the CNRS (the national scientific research council), Robert 
Aymar of the CEA (the French atomic energy agency) and Rene 
Garrec, president of the Basse Normandie region of France. The 
CNRS, CEA and Basse Normandie are contributing equally to the 
upgrade. 
  Both agencies plan to fund GANIL-plus through the internal 
redeployment of resources, in line with the findings of a recent 
review of large research facilities by the Conseil de Grands 
Equipements Scientifiques. 
  The review found that neither agency could afford all the 
projects it had planned or under way. Capital projects, such as 
GANIL-plus, could only be funded if something else was postponed 
or cancelled. 
  The scientific goals of GANIL-plus are three-fold and will 
be 
overseen by a steering committee of 12 physicists, chaired by 
Ben Mottelson, the Nobel-prize-winning nuclear theorist from 
NORDITA in Copenhagen. 
  In nuclear physics, radioactive ion beams will allow 
exploration of "superdeformed" nuclei - nuclei that cannot be 
made by colliding ordinary matter. The short-lived ions 
produced by GANIL-plus will also have proton/neutron ratios 
different to everyday, stable matter. 
  Radioactive nuclei are thought to play an important role in 
the evolution of stars. Direct measurements of cross-sections 
and lifetimes will test current theoretical models in 
astrophysics. In particular, GANIL-plus will be able to 
elucidate the various reaction pathways in nucleosynthesis that 
lead to the isotope abundances observed in the Universe.

  [Text] If radioactivity is released in the event of an 
accident in a nuclear plant, accurate information as to the 
amount and spread of radiation is extremely important. 
Radioactivity knows no frontiers, so monitoring systems must 
operate on an international scale. The Russian Federation is 
acquiring a system of this type, integrated into a system 
already in place in Germany. 
<H5>  Data Exchange Via Satellite </H5>
  Rapid, standardized, transregional radioactivity data 
exchange is of particular importance in the event of an accident 
and requires a modern information and communications 
infrastructure and regular practice in operating it. There have 
been several facilities in Russia measuring radioactivity to 
date, all working on their own, but a unified information system 
for recording and assessing the data acquired will now improve 
cooperation among them. The Federal Ministry of the 
Environment, Nature Conservation, and Reactor Safety (BMU) has 
commissioned German Aerospace AG to install a modern 
radioactivity metering and information system. IRIS (integrated 
radioactivity information system) is being set up for the 
Russian Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. In 
the first phase of the project, parameters collected and tested 
in the area surrounding the nuclear power station near Smolensk 
will be transferred to a central post in Moscow, where they will 
be processed and used to draw up radiological maps. As Germany 
has an interest in obtaining accurate information as early as 
possible in the event of accidents at Russian nuclear plants, 
the data will be transmitted to the Federal Republic via 
satellite and fed into the German information system. The IRIS 
metering network planned for Russia is based on the IMIS 
integrated metering and information system in Germany. After 
the Chernobyl reactor disaster, the BMU commissioned Dornier 
GmbH to create the user software for the system in 1988. 
<H5>  Radiation Metering System for Europe </H5>
  IMIS is an early warning system designed to minimize 
exposure 
to radiation following incidents involving the release of 
radioactivity. A program system that uses models to calculate 
the level of contamination in the water, soil, and air has been 
incorporated to assess the impact on the population. The 
calculations are used in conjunction with a catalog of measures 
from which the appropriate recommendations and instructions may 
be derived. The system comprises the following main functions: 
  -- measurement of radioactivity in environmental samples; 
  -- monitoring of environmental radioactivity in the air, 
soil, and water over large areas; 
  -- compilation, presentation, and assessment of 
radioactivity 
parameters; 
  -- dispatch of instructions and recommendations to the 
authorities concerned, and 
  -- information exchange among the authorities responsible. 
  The methods of linking and coordinating different metering 
facilities and networks devised for IMIS can be used for other 
environment protection operations, primarily waterway monitoring 
and soil conservation, as well. 
  Cross-border environmental problems call for information 
technology solutions using supraregional systems. Being of a 
decentralized nature, the integration of heterogeneous networks 
run by different organizations constitutes an ideal model for an 
integrated European environmental information system. IMIS 
systems of this type are already undergoing trials in the Czech 
and Slovak republics.

<F P=106> [Interview with ENEA President Prof. Nicola Cabibbo by </F>
Francesco Prestipino; place and date not given: "ENEA Has Faith 
in the Future;" first five paragraphs are RICERCA &amp; 
INNOVAZIONE 
introduction] 
  [Text] It has increased its research effort in the sectors 
it covers and, something new, it is working as an "agency" by 
publishing and distributing the results of its activities 
throughout Italy. 
  With over 5,000 employees, nine large research centers, and 
other smaller areas where it is working, ENEA [Agency for New 
Technologies, Energy, and the Environment] is present throughout 
Italy. 
  Amongst its new lines of intervention there are plans for 
the 
transfer and distribution of innovation to production, industry 
and agriculture, the development of components and technologies 
for the utilization of renewable sources of energy and energy 
saving, as well as research and experimentation of innovative 
nuclear reactors that are safer than those of the past. 
  This redefinition of its areas of competence is laying the 
foundations for the ENEA of the year 2000. It will be a 
producer of technological and managerial culture, and be at the 
service, in particular, of the manufacturing world. 
  Nicola Cabibbo, whom we have interviewed, has recently been 
called to direct this research giant. He is a scientist who is 
well known and respected by the international scientific 
community, and has come from the presidency of the INFN [Italian 
National Institute for Nuclear Physics]. 
  Prestipino: Prof. Cabibbo, the handbook of the 
new ENEA is definitely the 1993-95 three-year program, that was 
published in December 1992 and presents the programs and new 
objectives of the agency in 115 pages. How much of this 
reflects the situation of the old agency and how much describes 
the new one? 
  Cabibbo: Let us say immediately that this is a 
"sliding" plan, that has suffered from the time when it was 
drawn up, and allows for changes of direction as it goes along. 
The developments of the coming years will influence the way it 
is followed. 
  Prestipino: It has been said that the plan is 
already old or that anyway it reflects the ideas of the old 
agency. 
  Cabibbo: When I arrived at the ENEA I did not 
consider reviewing the plan because it is a lengthy procedure. 
Perhaps I will participate in the preparation of the next one. 
Let us not forget that it has been approved at ministerial 
level. 
  I think that it is very important for the agency to focus 
its 
activities better. Its nuclear activity having been 
interrupted, ENEA has found itself without the burden of this 
institutional duty. From this point of view the reform law of 
August 1991 is to be viewed very positively since it gave the 
agency precise goals. Nuclear energy was an enormous job that 
required commitment, involved great responsibility, care for the 
environment, and the development of advanced technologies. 
  Now my idea is to focus and gather the various initiatives 
around major projects, in a context that is easier to understand 
so that the objectives to be pursued are clearer. 
  The structural elements are still there. I mean to say, 
there is still the expertise in the energy field, and the fields 
of related problems, from the rational use of energy, to the 
alternative sources, to nuclear energy and so on. 
  Prestipino: So is it a plan without an itinerary 
that is to be reviewed as it goes along? 
  Cabibbo: Certainly. In the environmental field 
for example, a central problem is that of working in harmony 
with the others who are involved in this field. Let us not 
forget that there are about 3,000 researchers scattered around 
in various research centers working on the environment in Italy, 
and that about 800 of them are in ENEA. 
  Prestipino: Could ENEA have a role to play in 
this harmonization process? 
  Cabibbo: In the environmental field work is also 
done for projects. It is clear that ENEA will launch its own 
projects, like the one on the "Mediterranean Basin" that was 
presented at the end of September at our marine research center 
at Santa Teresa. 
  Yes, in some ways we put ourselves forward as promoters and 
coordinators, a little like we are for the Antarctic, but we are 
always ready to compare what we are doing with what others are 
doing. 
  Instead, that which ENEA can specifically provide and make 
available to safeguard the environment, on the one hand is 
systems ability, and on the other is technological ability. 
These two riches permit ENEA to take on important roles, at a 
global level, in programs that do not take single aspects into 
consideration, but that consider the environmental problems as a 
whole, since they are necessarily interconnected and often 
require multidisciplinary interventions and collaboration with 
other countries. For example, Spain is very interested in 
collaborating with us, and France, being very active in the 
environmental field, is already doing so. 
  Prestipino: Amongst the strategies for the 
renewal of the agency, what effect will the new line that you 
announced have on the use of the APE [Array Processor 
Experiment] super computer? 
  Cabibbo: The super computer is a central element 
for the transfer of scientific knowledge to major applications, 
ranging from those of the environment such as meteorology and 
climatic changes, to those of great technological interest such 
as metallurgy and combustion processes. ENEA has ordered a 
large parallel computer capable of performing 100 billion 
operations per second, an APE Quadrics, produced by Alenia 
Spazio under license from the INFN. At present it is the most 
powerful parallel computer available in the world and the 
technology is entirely Italian. 
  We have also ordered six small Quadrics that will either be 
used for developing programs or for new types of applications, 
made possible by the availability of the power of a super 
computer that has the size and advantages of a work station. 
  Prestipino: Will the super computer also be used 
in the energy sector? 
  Cabibbo: Certainly. For example, one of the 
problems that we are carefully studying in the energy field is 
that of combustion and this requires a combination of 
experimental techniques and numerical simulation. The trend is 
to consider the experimental techniques as the validation of the 
simulation techniques. The latter, in fact, are much richer, 
and permit a more detailed and careful study. ENEA has a very 
important experimental combustion center at Casaccia. We are 
trying to integrate this experimental center, so that it forms 
part of a more complete picture that will involve the use, once 
the Quadrics computer is available, of numerical simulation. 
This will put us in the vanguard. 
  Prestipino: At this stage of renewal, while the 
structure of the agency is being planned out on a grand scale, 
what would be a burden and what would be helpful? 
  Cabibbo: Compared to other agencies, ENEA is 
divided into large research centers, such as those at Casaccia 
and Frascati near Rome, Saluggia in Piemonte, Trisaia in 
Basilicata, Brasimone in the Tuscan-Emilian Appenines, Portico 
in Campania, Santa Teresa in Liguria and Bologna. This 
structure creates, on one hand, a managerial and organizational 
burden, but on the other it offers the advantage of being able 
to put an imposing striking force into the field to work on 
specific problems that require the simultaneous use and synergy 
of various types of expertise. This is what ENEA has always 
done in the past for the complex programs for nuclear power 
stations. 
  A very interesting program that has been recently managed by 
ENEA has been the "Antarctic Project." The agency was able to 
pour its technical-scientific and managerial ability into this 
program. ENEA received merit for having enabled Italy to 
present itself on the international scene in "full dress." A 
modern base was constructed in a short time and the quality of 
the research programs carried out has allowed us to become one 
of the nations of the Antarctic Treaty with full rights, and to 
collaborate, with equal scientific dignity, with the other 
countries that are already present, such as the United States 
and France. But the Antarctic program is a paradigm from 
another point of view in the sense that ENEA does not deal only 
with those aspects that it finds more congenial, such as the 
systems engineering and logistics that require extremely complex 
operations and the use of advanced technologies, but does so in 
close collaboration with other research bodies. The scientific 
program is multidisciplinary, and ENEA, although it is also 
present at this level, has a minor position with respect to the 
CNR [Italian National Research Council] and the universities 
that play the major part. 
  Prestipino: What direction will the new ENEA 
take, will it turn toward pure research or to a closer 
collaboration with industry? 
  Cabibbo: It will pass through research, but also 
through its applications. ENEA is able to do valid research and 
as the institutional duties of ENEA also include direct 
interventions, such as those on the environment, we are 
directing our work toward the concrete problems of the country. 
In order for this to be possible and for it to give the results 
that are wanted, the agency must have strong research components. 
  Prestipino: How is the agency preparing for its 
new duties? How are the personnel and the engineers being 
retrained? 
  Cabibbo: Technical abilities are easily 
transferable, particularly when you are working in complex 
sectors. For example, the director of the Antarctic program is 
a nuclear engineer. New expertise is certainly necessary to 
enter new fields, but the possibility of self training is also 
to be valorized. 
  When we think about training we also think about it as a 
further field of service that ENEA could offer the national 
community. 
  [Cabibbo continues] For example, today there is an extensive 
request for training that has arisen from local requirements for 
new expertise, resulting from the necessity to look after 
certain aspects of the safeguarding of the environment and to 
increase energy saving. ENEA has a wealth of expertise to offer 
in these sectors. 
  Prestipino: In a certain sense the reform law has 
put ENEA on the market, pushing it to find its own funding for 
autonomous survival. How is it doing? 
  Cabibbo: I would say well. One third of the 
funding is covered by collaboration programs with the ministries 
and with the European Community. It is enough to consider that, 
in terms of funding, international commissions entrusted to ENEA 
amount to about 120 billion per year. 
  Prestipino: The south of Italy, what lines of 
intervention are planned for this area by ENEA? 
  Cabibbo: ENEA is moving toward the actuation of 
the agreement on the Mezzogiorno [southern Italy] Program. For 
example we have already taken on 55 of the projected 80 
researchers. At present we are waiting, but in the meantime we 
are working on a new collaboration agreement with the ministry 
of scientific research. 
  We are not so interested in the value of the initiative 
being 
discussed, as we are in its ends, the goals of such a 
collaboration. 
  Prestipino: Energy. What is ENEA doing at an 
international level to have safe nuclear energy? 
  Cabibbo: Examining and reviewing current nuclear 
technologies following the referendum is of dramatic importance 
for ENEA. 
  An interesting point is that our European partners, in 
particular Germany, that were reluctant to accept the commitment 
to a new generation of reactors are now more disposed to do so. 
Work is being done on a new project at a European level. ENEA 
intends making its own contribution to this project, the EPR 
(European Pressurized Reactor), because it seems to meet our 
requirements in terms of social acceptability. 
  The safety characteristics of new reactors can no longer be 
expressed in terms of probabilities. The design must be such as 
to guarantee that even the biggest possible accident has no 
consequences, either for the environment, or for the population. 
  The research for these new generation power stations must 
continue to lead to reactors that are intrinsically safe, with 
which, in the worst case, it would be possible to lose the 
reactor itself, but without emissions outside the plant that 
were above the safety level. The construction of these plants, 
already technologically possible, depends on a number of 
factors, these being high costs, social acceptability, and the 
problems of managing them. ENEA's research program is very 
limited with respect to what the agency was doing in the 
'eighties, also because the new reactors require development and 
certification at a European level, if not at a world level. 
This is not a road that we can take alone. 
  Prestipino: Alternative forms of energy. Other 
countries have moved on to their commercialization. In Italy we 
are still at the research stage. What does ENEA intend to do? 
  Cabibbo: The renewable sources that ENEA is 
concerned with are wind energy and the energy that can be 
obtained from biomasses, such as garbage. They are already 
competitive, particularly if the social costs (pollution etc.) 
of the traditional sources of energy are taken into account. 
However, with respect to what is technologically possible 
today, Italy is behind as far as the use of energy derived from 
the wind is concerned. 
  It is necessary to provide incentives for the construction 
and use of this type of equipment, as has been done in Denmark 
and the United Kingdom, guaranteeing those that use the 
equipment (usually small producers) that their energy will be 
purchased. ENEA has collaborated with two Italian industries in 
the research and development for the construction of various 
models that are slightly different from those used in the 
northern European countries because of the lower wind speeds 
found in our regions. Denmark and the United Kingdom are 
demonstrating that already today it is possible to produce 
abundant energy from the wind, and to do so at competitive 
prices. 
  The time is also ripe for us to make the jump in quality 
from 
research to industrial application. It is one thing to 
construct a single prototype unit generating energy from the 
wind and it is another to construct a hundred, being able to 
count on the economies of scale. 
  Prestipino: And solar energy? 
  Cabibbo: Solar energy is less conventional than 
wind energy. The energy produced by solar power plants has a 
higher cost. It is an interesting technology for certain 
specialized applications, such as isolated houses. However, it 
still cannot make an impact on the energy consumption of the 
country. 
  Solar panels that are cheaper than those currently available 
are necessary if their use is to have a relevant impact. Once 
we have gotten over this problem, the solution to which could be 
found in the coming years, (ENEA is doing a lot of work in this 
direction, both at the Portici center and in collaboration with 
other countries) the photovoltaic cell will become very 
desirable, both for ecological motives, and from the aesthetic 
point of view. Let us not forget that wind-powered generators 
have been strongly contested in the United Kingdom because, 
according to some environmentalists, the blades of the windmills 
disfigure the countryside. 
  Prestipino: In conclusion, Prof. Cabibbo, where 
is ENEA going? How will it respond to the many older employees 
who are retiring early? How will the agency be renewed? 
  Cabibbo: ENEA is still feeling the influence of 
nuclear energy, which required an organizational set-up that is 
too burdensome today. As an agency that dedicates itself to 
other activities it will be necessary to adjust the team. 
  The early retirements would be very positive if it were 
possible to bring young people into the agency. At present we 
can only hire about 10 percent with respect to the number of 
people who are leaving. An ideal turnover figure would be 20/30 
percent. Without hiring young people, the agency is getting 
older. Two thousand people will be leaving and it will be 
necessary to hire at least 600 young people during the next 10 
years.

<F P=106> [Article signed AN PI BA SH: "Discovery in September of 10 </F>
Kilos of Uranium in Zurich: Security Services Targeted -- 
Commissioner Villiger Orders Development Survey"; as released by 
Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Berne, 18 Nov (ATS) -- The discovery in late 
September by Zurich police of 10 kilos of natural uranium 
originating from the former Eastern bloc was the result of tips 
given by the Information and Security Service (GRS) of the 
Federal Military Department (DMF). Federal councillor Kaspar 
Villiger has ordered the legal division of his department to 
throw some light on the affair, indicated the DMF Thursday. The 
role played by police chief Peter Regli, in particular, will 
have to be cleared up. 
  The Zurich canton police had discovered the uranium after 
receiving an anonymous telephone call. The caller said that he 
had deposited the merchandise at a freeway rest area in 
Kemptthal (Zurich), so that it could be disposed of in a 
competent manner. According to the DMF, the police were tipped 
off at the instigation of police chief Peter Regli, the deputy 
chief of the State Information Service. 
  The police inquiry concerning the case itself is under way. 
At the same time, the chief of the DMF has instructed the legal 
division of the department to establish the role played by the 
GRS in the affair. The flow of information and the contacts 
between the caller and the deputy chief will be subjected to 
close scrutiny. 
<H5>  GRS Informer </H5>
  The caller knew the police chief personally because he had 
done his military service with him in the air force. However, 
when interviewed by ATS, Daniel Eckmann, the spokesman for the 
DMF, said that the anonymous telephone call had come from a GRS 
informer. Supposedly, the man involved was an arms dealer living 
in Zurich. 
  It is claimed that he asked for advice from police chief 
Regli, who had then suggested that the caller turn to the 
competent police body, maintained Mr. Eckmann. The uranium 
courier had then explained to him that his life had been 
threatened if he went to the police. For that reason, the 
police chief contacted the police himself so that the uranium 
could be brought into safety as quickly as possible. 
  Evidently, stressed the DMF spokesman, a procedure of this 
kind is no everyday matter. It is not normal for the deputy 
chief of the State Information Service to be involved in such an 
operation involving the safe disposal of uranium. 
<H5>  Transparent Explanation </H5>
  Kaspar Villiger wants to establish all the facts "which will 
make it possible to evaluate the political and legal aspects of 
the intervention in their entirety," quoted the statement issued 
by the DMF. Police chief Regli ought to "have a transparent 
explanation" for all the circumstances leading up to the uranium 
being brought to safety. The DMF will take account of these 
explanatory remarks accordingly. 
  Peter Lehmann, the spokesman for the Public Ministry of the 
Confederation, confirmed an article in the German-language 
weekly "Cash," in which the person who supposedly deposited the 
uranium was an arms dealer living in Zurich. It is alleged that 
this dealer was arrested last 27 October at Zurich-Kloten 
airport. When interrogated by officials from the Public 
Ministry, it is claimed that he admitted having transported the 
merchandise from Eastern Europe to Zurich at the request of an 
unidentified contact so that it could be eliminated from the 
market. 
<H5>  25,000-Franc Fine </H5>
  It was thanks to an official from the police force of the 
Zurich canton that it had been possible to identify the arms 
dealer, following his recording of three anonymous telephone 
calls. The arms dealer could be charged with violating the 
federal law on atomic energy. Under Article 35 of the law he 
could be sentenced to pay a fine of up to 25,000 Swiss francs 
for the illicit trafficking of radioactive material. 
  According to specialists at the Paul-Scherrer Institute, who 
were called to the scene when the discharge of radioactivity had 
been established, the level of uranium radiation had not been 
very high. It is alleged that it would only have posed a danger 
to human beings after exposure to it over a two-hour period at 
close quarters.

Article Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Article by Phaisan Phutbongkhon: "Are Thai Workers in Libya </F>
in Danger?"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The question which 
causes concern is whether the 10,000 Thai workers in Libya will 
have to leave. And if they have to leave, will they return home 
or will they find work in other countries beforehand. It is 
certain that this problem will cause difficulties for Thai 
workers and their families at home and perhaps even for the 
government. 
  This is another big problem which might affect international 
business, the labor business and the market for Thai labor. 
[passage omitted] 
  This time America learned that Mr. Qadhdhafi was developing 
the most dangerous chemical weapons people could devise which 
could cause more suffering for those poisoned than nuclear 
weapons. 
  America could not allow Libya to continue to develop such 
chemical weapons because they would present a serious danger to 
American allies including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait as well as 
some other Arab states. Even Europe and America itself were 
threatened. Therefore America developed the plan to bomb the 
chemical weapons plant. 
  One must believe that America was concerned about Thailand 
and the Thai workers and so called for a withdrawal from the 
area beforehand. America feared that with the bombing many Thai 
workers would be injured and killed, and this might affect 
relations with the Thai government. As one Thai person I would 
like to thank America for the relatives of those Thai workers. 
  We Thai are the most peculiar people on earth. We get 
involved in various situations in various countries throughout 
the world. In many cases even the Thai government does not know 
about them. In almost every Arab country there are Thai people 
working at many different jobs from the lowest level to 
positions close to the leadership. 
  The "Saudi Diamond Case," which is so famous there is no 
telling how it will end, came about because we Thai went to work 
at the highest levels of the palace in Saudi Arabia. And the 
person who made it possible for Thailand and Thai people to be 
disgraced throughout the world turned out to be a Thai policeman. 
  In Libya it seems that there are Thai people working close 
to 
the leader, Mr. Qadhdhafi, who even peel fruit for him. At the 
factory which is to be bombed there are many Thai construction 
workers. 
  In fact if America had asked for good intelligence or at 
least had asked for cooperation from the Minister of Interior or 
asked my associates, then America's intelligence would have been 
better because Mr. Chiu or my associates could not be considered 
weak in intelligence. 
  It would appear that General Chawalit Yongchaiyut even had 
good information about who led the military leadership to 
believe that General Chawalit or Mr. Den Tomina was behind the 
burning of the school in the South and supported the 
partitioning of the land. It was a just a question of solving 
the political puzzle. 
  Many intelligence sources agreed that the target factory was 
under construction. But it was not clear whether it was a 
factory for chemical weapons or not. The construction this time 
was in an underground foundation, and a company from England, an 
American ally, was the contractor. By the time this was 
finished, it would have required at least two years to build the 
building, and it would have required a long time to assemble the 
machinery etc. Altogether it would have taken at least four 
years. By that time we would have been in the second or third 
Chuan government, or my Prime Minister Chuan, might not be in 
power any more. 
  The engineers for this factory were not just anybody. They 
were German engineers, and it was a company from Germany, an 
American ally. In a situation like this America should have 
known about this just as my Mr. Chiu knew. Why were they so 
concerned now? And it does not appear that Germany and England 
were warned to stop assisting the construction. 
  I feel that if America were genuinely concerned about the 
Thai workers, then it should have been no less concerned about 
the well-being and lives of the Germans and English. And if one 
considers the length of time [until completion] then the time to 
bomb would be when the factory is completed in two years because 
then an enormous investment could be destroyed at one time. In 
addition it would help America's allies to get the income from 
the project. Or the allies might be able to gain additional 
intelligence. It would appear that England feels the same. 
  Now I feel that the message to remove the Thai workers from 
Libya is strange somehow. 
  When one thinks about it, if the Thai workers are removed 
and 
the timing of the bombing is changed to two years in the future, 
where does the labor come from to do the work? 
  If one looks around, one can see three possible sources: 
South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. I think Vietnam would do the 
physical work while South Korea or Taiwan might supervise the 
construction. 
  If one thinks like this, one comes to the realization that 
this would be similar to economic assistance to Vietnam and 
setting up lines of communication with Vietnam. And the gaining 
of this experience by Vietnam could be important for opposition 
to China in the future. 
  We Thai might have to pay the price for stupidity. 
  We must call on the Thai government to consider this 
carefully. It should quickly withdraw the Thai workers for whom 
there is concern before it is necessary. 
  The homework for the Minister of Labor in this matter is 
very 
heavy because if America does not listen and bombs now then I 
feel we will lose some people.

"Department of Trade and Industry Cuts Red Tape for Computer 
Exporters"] 
  [Text] The Department of Trade and Industry has introduced 
an Open General Export Licence (OGEL) which will cut red tape 
faced by computer exporters. 
  Reflecting relaxations on export controls agreed by the 
Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Control (COCOM) 
earlier this month, the new licence will allow - subject to some 
conditions - the export of certain computers and signal 
processing equipment without the need to apply for individual 
export licences. The new licence comes into force immediately, 
however existing licenses are still valid for export. 
  Now exporters will be required to include with the official 
documentation for Customs a note stating that `the goods are 
being exported under the Open General Export Licence 
(Computers)'. They should keep records of all goods exported 
under the licence and must, before or within 30 days of the 
first use of the Licence, give the Secretary of State their 
details and an address where the records can be inspected. 
  The two types of goods which will now be eligible for the 
OGEL are: digital computers whose composite theoretical 
performance (CTP) is no more than 67 million theoretical 
operations per second (Mtops); and signal processing or image 
enhancement equipment with a CTP of no more than 40 Mtops. 
  The OGEL also contains provisions imposing certain 
conditions 
on use of the licence relating to the non-proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction. Destinations to which the OGEL does 
not apply are: Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Serbia, 
Montenegro, the United Nations Protected Areas in Croatia and 
those areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the control of the 
Bosnian Serb forces. 
<H5>  Note for Editors </H5>
  The Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls 
(COCOM) was established in 1950 as a non-Treaty based regime 
which operates informally through a number of committees 
supported by a permanent secretariat based in Paris. It operates 
on the basis of consensus and has traditionally been a forum 
where NATA allies, with Japan and Australia, review the scope of 
multilateral controls on the exports of sensitive dual-use, 
military and nuclear equipment and technology. 
  The recent relaxation of these export controls has been 
brought about by agreement reached within COCOM in response to 
changing strategic concerns and advances in technology.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Eckart Werthebach, president of the </F>
Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution "who heads 
the German security services," by Gad Shimron; in Werthebach's 
office in Cologne, date not given] 
  [Excerpt] Shimron: Ever since the fall of the 
Berlin Wall and the collapse of the communist regime we have 
been hearing more and more about the smuggling of dangerous 
materials (nuclear, chemical, and biological) from the east to a 
thriving black market here. What are you doing about the matter? 
  Werthebach: Smuggling of nuclear equipment and 
material or other weapons falls within our jurisdiction only 
when such activity is organized by a foreign intelligence 
service. 
  Shimron: Such as Iran? 
  Werthebach: Most of these activities are 
perpetrated by organized crime. However, we have evidence that 
Iran is very interested in the illegal acquisition of equipment 
and weapons of mass destruction and the means to launch them, 
and that the Iranian intelligence services are involved in these 
activities. They relocated their procurement office from London 
to Dusseldorf. I consider curbing these activities originating 
in Iran one of the most important missions of the organization I 
direct. We set up a special unit to deal solely and exclusively 
with the smuggling of weapons and equipment to dangerous 
countries. 
  Shimron: Iran has a big embassy in Bonn and a 
large procurement office in Dusseldorf. Is it true that they 
oversee all their nonconventional procurement programs from 
Germany? 
  Werthebach: First of all, I would like to say 
that I am convinced that the production of nonconventional 
weapons (nuclear, biological, and chemical) constitutes the 
worst type of terror one can imagine, because it does not just 
imperil one person but entire nations. That is why all of us, 
all my colleagues in the West, including Israel, are unanimous 
in our belief that the matter should be treated with utmost 
gravity. There is evidence, including the relocation of the 
Iranian procurement office from London to Dusseldorf, that the 
Iranians may be using Germany as a business center for all of 
Europe. They buy equipment and material not just from Germany, 
but also from neighboring countries. However, the entire 
business is overseen and administered from Germany. We have 
evidence to corroborate this assumption, and for our part, we 
have taken all the appropriate measures against this phenomenon. 
We treat the matter with utmost seriousness. Speaking from the 
point of view of an intelligence service, I can tell you that we 
have been doing all we can and we will do all that is necessary, 
incidentally, amid coordination with our partners. [passage

<F P=106> [EC press release No IP/93/1043: "TACIS Finances Major </F>
Conversion Project"] 
  [Text] TACIS, the European Community's technical assistance 
programme to the newly independent states (NIS), aims to set up 
a conversion plan in four regions of the former Soviet Union 
where the economy has in the past been largely based on military 
production. This ECU 4.5 million project will cover the regions 
of St. Petersburg and Samara (Russia), Kharkov (Ukraine), and 
Minsk (Belarus). 
  The objective of the conversion programme is to transform 
industrial capabilities from the production of weapons to 
civilian goods and, in so doing, maintain employment and 
technical capability levels. 
  The project will last 30 months and will be implemented by a 
consortium composed of British aerospace and the French 
consulting company softrade Intergroupe. 
  The military industrial complex of the former Soviet Union 
is 
a huge conglomerate of industries. It employs some 12 million 
people, 5 million of whom work on the production of weapons. It 
is administered by 9 ministers. These industries are 
concentrated in Russia, where they contribute to approximately 
half of the country's total industrial output. Other areas of 
concentration are Belarus and Ukraine where, in general, 
unrelated weapon components are produced for their final 
assembly in Russia. Together, these three republics employ a 
workforce of 7.3 million. Russia alone has 1,100 military 
enterprises employing 5.5 million staff, and 700 military 
research institutes (excluding nuclear) which employ a further 
1.3 million. The scale of Russia's defence-related industry, 
contributing to up to 50% of its total industrial output, 
indicates that the success of economic reform though less 
important than for Russia, the size of the industry in Ukraine 
and Belarus is also significant [sentence as received]. 
  Following the sharp drop in military orders in the last 4 
years (estimated at 70%), military companies started 
immediately to produce civilian goods. However, the lack of a 
coherent conversion plan resulted in a number of former military 
companies producing the same goods. Further obstacles to a 
successful conversion result from the vertically integrated 
structure and the lack of market culture within the management 
of the firms. Companies are structured to handle production 
from raw materials to product components through to the final 
products themselves. In most cases, they also produce the 
housing, clothing, food and other basic needs of employees. 
Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the 
management has a poor awareness of cost control methods, quality 
assurance, accounting, marketing services, distribution networks 
and after sale service. 
<H5>  What the EC Project Involves </H5>
  TACIS aims to prepare a conversion plan for the four regions 
following an assessment of the existing industrial assets, the 
identification of the potential and the scale of the 
corresponding investment. Conversion potential will be 
evaluated by selecting three categories of company: those that 
can be rapidly adapted to civilian production without 
substantial restructuring, those that require fundamental 
restructuring over a 5 to 10 year period and finally, those that 
do not lend themselves to conversion or where the cost would be 
prohibitive and their future viability doubtful. A limited 
number of companies from the first and second category will be 
selected for a full-scale feasibility study. 
  In a number of companies, it is expected that the results 
from such studies will be so promising that external investment 
will quickly follow. In other instances, the business case will 
need to be further investigated through a detailed financial 
analysis of the prospect of conversion and the corresponding 
costs, from organisational restructuring to the introduction of 
new processes, management methods and technology. As a result, 
the selected company will be provided with marketing plans and 
strategies, leading then to financing plans and/or joint venture 
prospectus. 
  Finally, the managers of the selected companies will undergo 
training by working closely with European experts who will be 
providing advice on the day-to-day functioning of these 
companies. The main objective of such training programmes is to 
have re-trained managers running restructured enterprises. 
  Conversion of Aviation Industries in Moscow [subhead] 
  In addition, the European Commission is making an important 
contribution to the development of a coherent military 
conversion strategy in Moscow itself. Its assistance to the 
aeronautical design bureau MIG [Mikoyan and Gurevich] and the 
aviation manufacturer Lukhovitsky will be carried out by a 
consortium led by Dassault aviation and composed of Arthur D. 
Little and the Ares group. The 2 million ECU project will last 
for two years. 
  From its establishment in Moscow in 1939 up to 1989, MIG, 
which currently employs some 5000 people, concentrated solely on 
the design of military aeroplanes. However, it now has to 
convert its activities to the design of civilian aircraft as 
orders from the military sector have been reduced by two thirds 
over the last four years. This process of conversion is slowed 
down by limited access to Western markets as a result of the 
lack of certification from Western authorities of the MIG 
quality assurance system. 
  Lukhovitsky, a manufacturing company established in 1962 and 
currently employing some 7500 people, specialises in the 
construction of military aircraft, including MIG fighters. It 
has recently had to face a similar decline in military orders to 
the Mig aeronautical design bureau and, despite its efforts to 
convert to the production of civilian goods, a coherent overall 
strategy is still lacking. 
  TACIS assistance is urgently needed to enable MIG and 
Lukhovitsky to develop domestic markets and gain greater access 
to foreign markets. Major tasks to be undertaken by TACIS 
include upgrading the MIG quality assurance system to Western 
standards and surveying its production of aluminium alloy parts. 
Furthermore, the existing means of production of Lukhovitsky 
will be assessed and, following an analysis of both Russian and 
foreign markets for an initial list of 100 potential 
opportunities, around fifteen products with the most potential 
will be selected. 
  The implementation of new business plans will be greatly 
aided by this assistance. By the end of the project, it is 
expected that MIG will be able to manufacture a structural unit 
for a civil aircraft in compliance with Western standards, 
representing a major step forward in the conversion of aviation 
industries.

  [Text] The government strongly urged Iran on 30 November 
to exercise caution in allowing the DPRK (North Korea) to test 
fire the latter's new-type "Nodong-1" missile in Iran by 
notifying that country that if it allows North Korea to test 
fire such a missile on its territory, it would suspend the 
extending of yen-based loans to Iran that will be used to 
finance the construction of hydroelectric power plants. 
  This has been disclosed by a government source, and it is 
the 
first time that the Japanese Government has put diplomatic 
pressure on Iran not to permit North Korea to test fire such a 
missile in Iran. 
  According to the same government source, North Korea is said 
to be planning to test fire the "Nodong-1" missile in Iran in 
mid- December after obtaining Iran's consent. In response to the 
Japanese Government's urging, the Iranian side said, "Iran has 
no intention of allowing North Korea to test fire the missile." 
Yet the Japanese Government still remains suspicious. 
  The Japanese Government, which seeks U.S. collaboration in 
confirming North Korea's missile test firing in Iran, plans to 
suspend the yen-based loans to Iran when it confirms that. It 
is believed that Japan's suspension of the yen-based loans to 
Iran would inevitably sour relations between the two countries. 
  In late last May, North Korea test fired the "Nodong-1" 
missile from its eastern coast area over the Sea of Japan. At 
the time, the missile flew about 500 km over the sea, but it is 
said to have a range of about 1,300 km. The prevailing view is 
that in the test firing last May, North Korea shortened the 
distance of missile flight by adjusting launch method. 
  North Korea is believed to hope to test fire a missile with 
a 
range of 1,300 km in Iran. 
  Meanwhile, the Japanese Government in May last year 
committed 
38.6 billion yen in yen-based loans to Iran. 
  A note exchanged between Japan and Iran at the time included 
Japan's four principles for the Official Development Assistance 
(ODA) whereby Japan extends yen-based loans to other nations 
taking into account "the military spending; the development and 
manufacturing of weapons of mass destruction; and the export and 
import of weapons in those nations." The exchange of note, 
however, mentioned nothing about prohibiting Iran from providing 
North Korea with a site for missile test firing.

<F P=106> [Bronwen Maddox report: "Five Countries Query Legality of </F>
Thorp Permit"] 
  [Text] The government has received inquiries from the 
European Commission and other European governments about the 
legality of licensing the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant in 
Cumbria, it emerged yesterday. 
  Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, told the Commons in a 
written answer that, since the start of the second public 
consultation on Thorp in August, the government had received 
letters from the Irish Republic and Denmark about the 
application of the European directive on environmental impact 
assessments to Thorp. 
  He added that Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands had also 
written to the UK about Thorp and the environmental impact 
assessments required under international marine pollution 
recommendations. Ministers are expected to announce within days 
whether they will give the go-ahead to the 2.8 billion pound 
plant. They have already said that they are "minded" to grant a 
licence. British Nuclear Fuels, the plant's owner, has said 
that the alternative of launching a public inquiry could delay 
start of operation by months and would undermine its 
profitability. 
  Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, 
said 
yesterday: "It would be nonsense for the government to give the 
plant the nod only for the European Court to rule it illegal 
later." 
  Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group whic has 
mounted 
court challenges to the government's handling of the Thorp 
decision, said yesterday it believed that full environmental 
impact assessments should be carried out before a decision was 
made.

  [Text] Russia will refrain from supplying the technology 
for producing cryogenic missile boosters to India thus cutting 
away at 80% of the 1991 Indian deal's value, Russian Vice 
Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin told INTERFAX on Wednesday. 
  He said the supply of the boosters will continue, while the 
technology will not be handed over. Shokhin pointed out that 
India was buying missile technologies rather that cryogenic 
boosters themselves. 
  The contract stipulated that Russia was to supply two 
boosters each worth about $6 million to India. The first 
booster was to be delivered in 1995. After the contract is 
amended, the contract's value earlier estimated at $220 million 
may be slashed by over 80%, according to the Russian Space 
Agency. 
  The new terms will be formulated in a stricter accordance 
with the requirements of the Missile Technology Control Regime. 
Russia signed a memorandum on its intention to observe its 
provisions in Washington on September 2 this year. The 
memorandum demands the necessary amendments should be made to 
the contracts running counter to the regime before January 1, 
1994.

  [Text] Russia pledges to supply to India at least four more 
cryogenic boosters for a SLV-3 rocket, twice more than 
stipulated by the 1991 contract. 
  As the General Director of Russia's Space Agency Yuriy 
Koptev 
has told INTERFAX, an agreement on additional supplies has been 
reached at negotiations in Bangalore between Indian Space 
Research Organization (ISRO) officials and Russian experts 
earlier this month. 
  In Koptev's words, India will get two more boosters as 
compensation for Russia's forced repeal of the additional 
agreements as incompatible with the Missile Technology Control 
Regime (MTCR), accords that provide for the delivery of 
cryogenic technology and equipment to Delhi and for Indian 
specialists' training. 
  Thereby, Koptev said, "Russia has kept virtually intact the 
volume of financing" envisaged by the contract and its addenda 
and estimated at $220 Mn. The first booster is to be supplied 
in 1995. 
  In Koptev's opinion, putting relations with ISRO on a 
footing 
in line MTCR, which Russia intends to join, has not had any 
adverse effect on bilateral cooperation, which is borne out by 
the two countries short-term plan to sign an intergovernmental 
agreement in the field.

  [Text] Paris, 3 Dec 1993 (AGENCE EUROPE) - The Assembly of 
the Western European Union (WEU) adopted a recommendation in 
Paris urging the WEU Council to encourage cooperation with the 
countries of the former USSR in the field of high-tech, "so as 
to encourage transparency in the transfer of material for both 
civil and military use." Indeed, the Assembly notes that the 
internal stability in these countries depends to a large extent 
on modernising their structures and transformation in economic, 
industrial and technological domains, domains where it believes 
it is possible and desirable to improve Western assistance for 
these countries. The Assembly insists on the creation of a 
European information system, as currently initiatives often have 
a double use, and calls on WEU member countries to give all 
their political and economic support to Moscow's International 
Centre for Science and Technology, whose aim is to prevent the 
proliferation of technologies of mass destruction. Noting that 
Ukraine and Kazakhstan had not yet acceded to the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Assembly called on the WEU Council 
to try to obtain this accession.

safety in the country concerned; (3) the respect of the main 
international agreements on nuclear safety, and accession to the 
international conventions of Paris and Vienna on the civil 
liability of the operators. It also asks the Commission to 
submit to it as soon as possible: 
  --the major outlines of its master plan on nuclear safety in 
the East; 
  --a detailed analysis of the recent joint report by the 
World 
Bank, IEA [International Energy Agency] and EBRD [European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development] on the different alternative 
scenarios concerning nuclear safety in a global energy context; 
  --an energy strategy for the East, environmentally 
sustainable and based on the priority of massive and accelerated 
development of energy efficiency in energy production, transport 
and consumer sectors. In the framework of this strategic plan, 
it asks the Commission that financial assistance in the 
framework of the PHARE [Poland-Hungary: Actions for Economic 
Reconversion] and TACIS [Technical Assistance to the 
Commonwealth of Independent States] programmes places emphasis 
on projects involving true partnership, parallel actions between 
operators and safety authorities and on twinning between Eastern 
and Western European power stations and safety organisations. In 
negotiations with the countries concerned, the Commission has to 
take account of the following objectives: 
  (a) commitment by countries to drawing up plans for shutting 
down the most dangerous power plants (VVER-230 and RBMK); 
  (b) introducing a legislative framework for controlling 
safety in each of the countries concerned with provisions which 
conform to those adopted at Community level; 
  (c) defining global energy programmes; 
  (d) setting up independent safety authorities; 
  (e) adopting energy saving measures; 
  (f) gradually introducing a real price for energy. 
  EURATOM [European Atomic Energy Community] loans for nuclear 
safety in the East remain blocked Commissioner Chistophersen not 
having given Parliament the assurances it regarded as necessary 
concerning the conditionality of aid, at the request of its 
rapporteur, Parliament sent back to Committee a second report by 
Mr. Herve concerning the capacitation of the Commission to 
contract EURATOM loans to contribute to funding towards 
improving the degree of the efficiency and safety of the nuclear 
sector in countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the 
Republics of the former USSR. During the debate, Mr. 
Christophersen told Parliament that the European Commission 
shared their objectives, but that there were differences in the 
means of attaining these. In particular, he considered that 
Parliament was going a little too far and that it was hardly 
possible to require of the Eastern countries that they close 
down their plants in order to obtain Community aid. As for the 
proposal to create a task force responsible for these questions 
within the European Commission, Mr. Christophersen considered 
that the implementation of the PHARE and TACIS programmes had, 
after some difficulties, found their cruising speed, and that it 
was not essential to take further initiatives at organisational 
level. The Commission intends acting in four fields: 
  --on-the-ground-support for modernization; 
  --analysis of construction safety of those plants which 
already exist in the countries concerned; 
  --setting up independent controls; 
  --restructuring and storage. 
  As for the possibility of recourse to EURATOM loans, Mr. 
Christophersen regretted that Parliament had on several 
occasions postponed the debate on the subject, pointing out 
that, to guarantee safety in Central and Eastern Europe and 
former USSR comparable to that which exists in the West, it 
would require at least ECU [European Currency Unit] 10 billion a 
year (notably by mobilising international capital). The 
co-president of the Green Group, Paul Lannoye was not satisfied 
with Mr. Christophersen's replies on: 
  (a) the EURATOM Treaty and the recycling of irradiated 
fuels: 
the Treaty does not mention this at all, otherwise, tell me 
which Article, Mr. Lannoye asked Mr. Christophersen, who 
affirmed that this was a priority issue in the Treaty; 
  (b) the import by COCEMA [Comittee of European Manufacturers 
of Plant for the Food Industry] of uranium from Russia: the 
Commission, Mr. Christophersen recalled, has already approached 
France. To Mr. Lannoye who pointed out that the problem was not 
a recent one and that it had been going on for twenty years, Mr. 
Christophersen replied that the Commission had sent France a 
warning. In favour of uniform rules of safety in the Community, 
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union at the same time, 
Parliament adopted a resolution on nuclear safety, submitted by 
the Socialist Group, by which it considers that the rules to be 
respected in the field of nuclear safety have to be harmonized 
at Community level, as well as in Eastern Europe and the CIS, on 
the basis of more rigorous safety. 
  It urges the political authorities of the countries of 
Central and Eastern Europe and the CIS to commit themselves to 
drawing up plans with a view to an immediate decommissioning of 
the most dangerous nuclear power plants. It insists on the need 
for these countries to look at other forms of energy, taking 
account of environmental considerations. It calls on the Council 
and Commission to ensure that Community aid does not encourage 
the construction or renovation of nuclear sections in these 
countries aimed at promoting export strategies of cheap 
electricity, but produced to the detriment of safety rules of 
countries in the European Union or EFTA [European Free Trade 
Association]. It calls on the Commission and the Council to be 
extremely vigilant and to ensure, on one hand, that the 
Community and all the States concerned by the transport of 
radioactive material are beyond such incidents, and, on the 
other hand, that the means used for this kind of transport 
fulfill the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] safety 
standards. It calls on the Commission to find a solution to the 
problem of storing radioactive waste, and to study, for each 
Member State, the possibilities of long-term storage, and also 
to analyse medium and long-term radiological effects on man and 
the environment.

  [Text] Prague, Jan 18 (CTK) -- The Czech Foreign Ministry 
has neither been informed about Skoda heavy engineering company 
General Director Lubomir Soudek's negotiations in Iran last 
November nor has it been approached by anyone from the Iranian 
side, ministry spokeswoman Lucie Pilipova told CTK today. 
  The latest issue of the Czech political weekly RESPECT 
reported that during the visit to Iran, the delegation from the 
Plzen, west Bohemia-based Skoda company led by Soudek negotiated 
with the Iranian Defense Ministry and Army representatives on 
the possibility of supplying Iran with weapons and military 
systems. 
  The weekly said that representatives from the Czech Foreign 
Ministry had also been present at the talks. 
  Pilipova declined to comment on the published article or on 
other reports on the topic that have appeared in the Czech media 
recently. 
  Neither has a spokesman for the Iranian Embassy in Prague 
commented on the article, citing a statement issued by his 
embassy in December. At that time Iranian Ambassador in Prague 
Rasul Movahedijan distanced himself from the information on his 
country's alleged efforts to obtain nuclear technology from the 
Czech Skoda company. At the same time he spoke in favor of 
closer contacts with the company, emphasizing that this 
cooperation was directed solely towards peaceful projects. 
  Skoda representatives admitted in December that Soudek had 
negotiated on the possible nuclear project -- the construction 
of a nuclear power plant -- during his November visit to 
Teheran, but added that no agreement was concluded. 
  Israeli Ambassador to the Czech Republic Moshe Yegar, in an 
interview with CTK in December, voiced the view that any 
supplies for nuclear energy projects to Iran were 
extraordinarily dangerous and voiced doubts about Iran's 
sincerity in connection with the presentation of its nuclear 
program as solely peaceful one. 
  RESPECT wrote that during the November talks with Skoda 
representatives, not only were supplies for nuclear energy 
projects discussed, but Iran also showed interest in Czech 
supplies of "special technology" -- ground-to-air missiles, 
modernized T-72 tanks, and the Tamara detection system, which 
can track aircraft equipped with special anti-radar devices.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Negotiations on Cooperation </F>
Agreement With Russia Expected To Be Relaunched"; as released by 
Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] Since the signing of the EC/Russia political 
statement on 9 December (for which Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin came to Brussels in person), negotiations between the EC 
and Russia on the conclusion of a partnership and cooperation 
agreement have known a period of reduced activity. A meeting of 
experts planned for end of December in Moscow has been postponed 
(Russian sources indicate that it should take place at the end 
of January) and the initialing of the final agreement could, say 
well-informed sources, take place toward the end of March. This 
development does not correspond to the optimistic scenario 
described by politicians on both sides at the signing of the 
political statement when not only the president in office of the 
European Council, Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, but 
also the president of the Commission, Jacques Delors, had 
announced that an agreement would be signed in the next few 
days. Relaunching negotiations was the central topic of talks 
that the Russian Ambassador to the EC, Mr. Silaew, had on Monday 
[17 January] and Tuesday [18 January] with the vice-president of 
the European Commission, Mr. Christophersen, with Sir Leon 
Brittan and also with Mr. Benavides of the DG-I [Directorate 
General I -- external relations]. EUROPE believes that the 
reasons for the present break are both technical and political, 
given that: 
  (a) Fundamental divergence persists, notably in the nuclear 
field (in particular concerning the rules and provisions to 
govern the trade of uranium between the EC and Russia), maritime 
transport and access to the banking market (where Russia calls 
for a transition period). As regards the nuclear question (by 
far the most tricky question), France insists for trade 
questions to be governed by a separate accord between the EC and 
Russia, in this case the EURATOM agreement (negotiated 18 months 
ago with Russia but never completed) which would give the EC 
more possibilities for acting in connection with over-large 
import flows or dumping practices in the trade of enriched 
uranium. The 11 other member states, the Commission and Russian 
authorities hope to include this chapter in the cooperation 
agreement. It seems that the Commission recently submitted a 
compromise solution to Russian authorities. It is now awaiting 
Moscow's reply; 
  (b) After the parliamentary elections in Russia in December 
and given the political and staffing changes that have taken 
place within the Russian Government, the EC expects the 
situation will become more stable and that its interlocutors in 
negotiations will be clearly identified; 
  (c) Further to the real "forcing" by negotiators before and 
during Mr. Yeltsin's stay in Brussels (mainly in order to make 
it possible to sign the statement), the Twelve needed time for 
reflection in order to examine results obtained in detail.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazuhisa Ogawa, military analyst, from the </F>
"Sunday Debate" column: "Theater Missile Defense Ineffective 
Against North Korea"] 
  [Text] Reports on the Nodong-1 missile of the DPRK (North 
Korea) in Japan all give the impression that this missile may 
hit Japan directly any time. This is precisely a case of 
"looking at the tree but losing sight of the forest," a uniquely 
Japanese way of perception. 
  If we look at the position of North Korea in the world; that 
is, the "forest" as a whole, a different vision opens before us. 
  Around North Korea, there is the towering presence of the 
United States with its enormous military power. Russia and 
China, with their impressive military power, and Japan, with its 
enormous economic power, are all keeping a close watch over 
North Korea. 
  Cruisers and frigates of the U.S. Seventh Fleet based in 
Yokosuka carry a total of more than 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles 
(with conventional warheads), which have 450-kg warheads with a 
range of 1,300 km. They can reach the entire North Korean 
territory any time. 
  If North Korea succeeds in attaching nuclear or chemical 
warheads to Nodong-1, and decides to use them, it must be ready 
to sustain total destruction. 
  North Korea has its reasons for developing missiles under 
such circumstances. Karl Von Clausewitz, in his book "On War," 
said: "War is merely a continuation of policy implemented by 
other means." North Korea follows his teaching to the letter. A 
political objective is always present behind any military action. 
  North Korea's objective is "soft landing"; that is, the 
continuation of the Kim Il-song regime. It wants the world to 
guarantee democratization and economic development for North 
Korea at its own pace. Thus, it is reasonable to think that 
North Korea actually wants the world to stop it from developing 
nuclear missiles. It calculates that economic aid will be 
offered to discourage it from missile development. This 
tug-of-war is expected to continue. 
  It is true that the Nodong-1 and the development of nuclear 
weapons pose a serious threat to Japan. However, TMD [theater 
missile defense] will not help at all to stop this. 
  How far has North Korea gone in its efforts to develop 
missiles and warheads? The Nodong-1 is an improved version of 
the very old short range ballistic missile "Scud," which the 
former USSR started to manufacture in the 1950s. If North Korea 
had no other choice but to improve on this outdated model, that 
means it does not have the capability to develop modern missiles. 
<H5>  Nuclear Warheads Not Probable </H5>
  Since the Nodong-1 is an improved version of the Scud, its 
performance is bound by the limitations of the Scud. Inferring 
from Iraq's "Al Abbas," warheads of Nodong-1, with a range of 
1,000 km, are probably around 150 kg in weight. Since the 
amount of fuel Nodong-1 carries is also increased, at the point 
liquid fuel undergoes explosive combustion, the fuel tank 
becomes empty, resulting in the missile losing its balance. It 
is very difficult to control this. Such is the limitation of 
Nodong-1's performance. 
  As to warheads, even assuming that North Korea has succeeded 
in developing a nuclear device, this is probably neither a bomb 
nor a warhead, but something in the vicinity of a "nuclear 
explosion device" about three to five tons in weight. Two to 
four years is required to downsize this. North Korea hopes that 
it will be stopped during this period. A similar amount of time 
is necessary to acquire the technology to control chemical 
warheads or to spread poisonous gas. Thus, both nuclear and 
chemical warheads are quite improbable. 
  When a conventional warhead weighing 150 kg hits the target, 
its shrapnel scatters over an area of 120 square meters at most. 
In terms of cost and effect, the whole exercise is quite 
meaningless. 
  The U.S. economic system is termed a war economic system. 
The mainstays of this system, the oil and arms industries, all 
rely on defense appropriations. The fatal weakness of this 
economic system is that for the system to function normally, a 
strategic weapons system, which has limitless possibilities for 
development, has to be introduced. Since the TMD involves high 
technology, it embodies limitless potentials for research and 
development. 
  The U.S. defense research budget is around 5 trillion yen, 
which is even larger than the entire Japanese defense budget. 
The TMD has to be viewed in such a context. This is more an 
economic issue between Japan and the United States than a 
military question. Japan has to deal with the United States 
with such a understanding. 
<H5>  Japan Lacks a Strategic Viewpoint </H5>
  It is important to stop North Korea from developing nuclear 
weapons and missiles. The United States and the ROK declare 
that they will always keep the door open while they apply 
pressure on North Korea with economic sanctions and military 
options. 
  The United States also professes that if North Korea 
compromises it is ready any time to send in big business to work 
on improving the DPRK infrastructure, and help in economic 
development. It is also preparing to help North Korea convert 
its nuclear power plants to light-water reactors. Japan does 
not possess such a strategic viewpoint. 
  I believe Japan's involvement with the TMD should not go 
beyond the limits of the Japan-U.S. security setup. This should 
be the natural conclusion considering the TMD is an economic 
issue by its very nature.

  [Text] In an effort to help Asian countries and other 
nations beef up their export control of arms and arms-related 
technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
is scheduled to establish an "export control support center" on 
10 January within the security trade information center, which 
is MITI's auxiliary organ. Underlying MITI's establishment of 
the support center is its conclusion that as a result of the 
scheduled reorganization of the Coordinating Committee for 
Export Control (Cocom) in late March as a new organ designed to 
prevent the spread of arms to "strife- potential countries," it 
will be more important to strengthen export control systems of 
countries other than the advanced nations. 
  Three staff members will be working at the support center on 
a full-time basis, and its planned activities will include the 
holding of export control seminars for Asian nations and former 
Soviet republics including Russia, and the dispatch of experts 
to these nations. MITI, in its budgetary requests for fiscal 
1994, has appropriated 40 million yen for the support center. 
It held an export control seminar for Asian nations last 
October for the first time, but from now on, such activities 
will be conducted by the support center.

  [Text] Demand for domestically produced reconnaissance 
satellites is rapidly growing in the Defense Agency. Since 
North Korea successfully conducted a test launching of its 
"Nodong-1" ballistic missile, which can directly hit Japan, the 
agency has been stressing the need for tools to keep track of 
North Korea's missile development. The agency is currently 
reviewing the "National Defense Program Outline" upon request of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and is supposed to draft the 
revised outline by the end of this year. The new outline is 
expected to emphasize reinforcement of the nation's 
intelligence-gathering and analysis capability. Procurement of 
military satellites is difficult for Japan because a 1969 Diet 
resolution rules out the nation's development of space 
technology except for peaceful purposes. However, it appears 
that the agency thinks the prime minister may like the proposal 
for obtaining the satellites since he tends to attach importance 
to high-technology equipment. 
  Full-fledged reconnaissance satellite systems are currently 
possessed by only three nations -- the United States, Russia, 
and China. If Japan decides to build its own military 
satellites, neighboring nations would certainly react strongly 
to the decision. Even within the country, the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan, a coalition member, would strongly oppose such 
an attempt. 
  A reconnaissa?ce satellite system should have ground 
facilities worth over 150 billion yen [Y], and three to four 
satellites, which would cost at least Y40-50 billion each. A 
senior Defense Agency official said: "Taking maintenance 
expenses into account, the satellite system would cost several 
hundred billion yen." Moreover, as the trail-blazing pioneer of 
space development, the United States may react negatively to 
Japan's attempts to develop its own space technology. Even in 
the Defense Agency, few people believe the plan can come to 
fruition easily. 
  The Defense Agency has already begun studying the political, 
technical, and financial problems involved in obtaining 
satellites within the 1990's. A senior official said: "In the 
next five-year defense buildup plan, which will begin in fiscal 
1996, we would like to advocate the need for Japan to obtain its 
own reconnaissance satellite, at the least." 
  The introduction of reconnaissance satellites has been an 
earnest desire of the Defense Agency, which aims at establishing 
Japan's own system for gathering and analyzing strategic 
information. At present, Japan depends to a large extent on the 
United States for military data on its immediate strategic 
environment. 
  In Diet interpellation in 1985, former Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro Nakasone expressed a positive stance toward Japan 
obtaining its own reconnaissance satellites. At that time, 
however, the government could not further discuss tangible 
measures for obtaining the satellites due to the 1969 Diet 
resolution saying "Japan's development and use of space 
technology should be limited to peaceful purposes." However, 
the Defense Agency is seeking a breakthrough for obtaining 
satellites on the pretext of the government's 1985 statement 
that "it is possible for the Self- Defense Forces to use 
information provided by general-purpose satellites, such as 
weather satellites."

historical sciences at Institute of U.S. and Canadian Studies, 
Russian Academy of Sciences: "The Challenge to International 
Security: North Korea and Nuclear Weapons"] 
  [Text] The author is deeply grateful to the Center 
for War, Peace, and Media Studies (New York) and the 
Russian-American Information Agency for reference materials used 
in the compilation of this article. 
  In the Vancouver declaration on the results of the meeting 
of 
the Russian and U.S. presidents on 3-4 April, the leaders of the 
two countries acknowledged the great importance of preventing 
the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery 
vehicles. They reaffirmed their determination to strengthen the 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to turn 
it into an open-ended and global pact.[.sup]1[/] 
  Despite the good intentions of Russia and the United States 
and of the majority of countries in the world community, 
however, North Korea's actions have given rise to the most 
severe crisis in international non-proliferation policy since 
the time the treaty first went into effect (in 1968). 
  On 12 March 1993 the DPRK officially notified the UN 
Security 
Council of its intention to withdraw from the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and thereby free itself 
from its political obligation not to develop nuclear weapons. 
The DPRK became the first country in the world to announce its 
planned withdrawal from the treaty. This decision could set a 
dangerous precedent and have a negative effect on the nuclear 
non-proliferation framework, which is overseen by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). A letter to the 
foreign ministers of the states party to the treaty says that 
the DPRK decided to withdraw from the treaty in connection with 
the state of emergency that arose in the country as a result of 
the American-South Korean "Team Spirit" maneuvers and with the 
"unfair resolution" the IAEA Board of Governors passed on 25 
February, demanding that military installations with no 
relationship to nuclear activity be opened for inspection. 
Article 10 of the treaty says: "Each party to this treaty shall, 
in exercising its national sovereignty, have the right to 
withdraw from the treaty if it decides that extraordinary 
events, related to the subject matter of this treaty, have 
jeopardized the supreme interests of its country. It shall give 
notice of such withdrawal to all other parties to the treaty and 
to the UN Security Council three months in advance. Such notice 
shall include a statement of the extraordinary events it regards 
as having jeopardized its supreme interests." 
  When the DPRK made the announcement, it also put its army on 
red alert, and the Republic of Korea responded by doing the 
same. "A war between the DPRK and the United States could break 
out at any moment," the DPRK ambassador to the United Nations 
declared. 
  Many experts believed just a short time ago that the threat 
of a North Korean nuclear weapon was considerably diminished, if 
not completely non-existent. After signing the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty in 1985, the DPRK agreed to put its nuclear facilities 
under IAEA control in 1992. Inspections created strong 
suspicions, however, that the declared quantity of plutonium was 
far smaller than the amount actually produced. On 25 February 
this year the IAEA decided to conduct a "special inspection," 
envisaging access to any and all facilities and gave the DPRK a 
month to open two facilities where the undeclared plutonium 
might be located. The DPRK responded by announcing its 
withdrawal from the treaty. 
  This was the beginning of the crisis in the nuclear 
non-proliferation framework, which was then alleviated in a 
somewhat unexpected manner. Just one day before Pyongyang's 
decision would become a reality, on 11 June, a joint 
American-North Korean statement was published and said that the 
DPRK "is unilaterally postponing any action on its intention to 
withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons for the period of time it deems necessary." 
  The nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula had tremendous 
repercussions in the world community. There is widespread 
interest in assessments of the DPRK's technological capabilities 
for the development of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass 
destruction, the motives behind its announced withdrawal from 
the treaty, the implications of this decision for the 
non-proliferation framework, and the role of the world's leading 
countries, the United Nations, and the IAEA in resolving this 
crisis. 
<H5>  Arsenal and Potential </H5>
  Nuclear potential: Experts agree that Pyongyang 
has the industrial potential to build nuclear weapons. The 
network of atomic industry facilities that was built up over 
almost three decades of work on the nuclear program in the DPRK 
could be used for military purposes. 
  A 200-MW gas-graphite natural-uranium reactor is being 
built, 
for example, and sites are being chosen for the construction of 
three 635-MW reactors. There are two plants for the enrichment 
of uranium. There are uranium mines in Pakch'on and Pengason. 
Uranium reserves have been estimated at 26 million tonnes of ore 
(over 15,000 tonnes of uranium). 
  With the help of the USSR and the PRC, the DPRK used its 
existing crude resources to build a scientific-experimental 
infrastructure in the 1950s and 1960s and began training the 
necessary group of specialists. The DPRK has several specialized 
scientific research institutes, including the nuclear power 
engineering and radiology institutes, the Nuclear Physics 
Department of Pyongyang University, and the School of Nuclear 
Research Technology at the Kimch'aek Polytechnical Institute. 
  History and the Present Day: North Korea's nuclear 
research began right after World War II. Attracted by the DPRK's 
deposits of uranium ore, the Soviet Union assisted in geological 
prospecting and the assessment of reserves for the possible 
development of an atomic industry. Western experts believe that 
the ore began to be mined and exported to the USSR in the late 
1940s. In 1952, at the height of the Korean War, China took an 
interest in North Korea as a source of uranium for its own 
nuclear bomb. At that time the USSR and the PRC were working 
together closely in the atomic field, including its military 
spheres. In 1955 researchers from the North Korean Academy of 
Sciences addressed an international conference on the 
development of atomic energy in Moscow. In 1956 the USSR and 
DPRK concluded an agreement (which was renewed several times) on 
cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. In accordance 
with this document, scientists and experts from North Korea 
received instruction and training at atomic facilities in the 
USSR, particularly in Dubna. 
  Pyongyang signed the same kind of agreement with the PRC. 
According to some reports, Korean specialists were trained in 
the Chinese nuclear research center in Lop Nor and were even 
present when nuclear weapons were tested. 
  The Atomic Research Center, where the main nuclear projects 
were conducted, was established in Nenben in 1964. In 1965 the 
USSR supplied the DPRK with a 5-MW research nuclear reactor, 
which has been under IAEA control since 1977. The North Koreans 
began building their own reactor in Nenben in the beginning of 
the 1980s. This 50-MW reactor is scheduled to begin operating in 
1995. It is significant that both reactors, the 5-MW and the 
50-MW, are categorized as dual-purpose reactors and can be used 
to generate electricity and to produce weapons-grade plutonium. 
Israel and India used the same kind of reactors for this 
purpose. Experts agree that light-water reactors are preferable 
for civilian needs and gas-graphite reactors are the best choice 
for military use.[.sup]2[/] 
  According to estimates, the research reactor began operating 
in the middle of the 1980s and is capable of producing 4-7 
kilograms of plutonium a year. The more powerful reactor in 
Nenben can produce 40-60 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium 
each year. 
  The gas-graphite natural-uranium reactor in T'aech'on 
(around 
80 kilometers from Pyongyang) is capable of producing 160-200 
kilograms of plutonium a year. The combined product of the three 
reactors would amount to around 200-260 kilograms of 
weapons-grade plutonium a year. 
  Before the plutonium from reactors can be used to produce 
nuclear weapons or in breeders, it has to be extracted from the 
spent fuel in special radiochemical plants. The construction of 
this kind of enterprise began at the end of the 1980s in Nenben. 
Experts have estimated that it will be capable of processing 
several hundred tonnes of nuclear waste a year. According to 
DPRK spokesmen, the plutonium regeneration enterprise is being 
built as part of the program for the development of breeders and 
is a laboratory rather than a plant. Western experts doubt 
Pyongyang's ability to carry out this kind of program. Only a 
few industrially developed countries, such as Japan, could 
afford the high cost of this kind of program. On 22 July 1992, 
IAEA Director General J. Blix said that this enterprise meets 
all of the criteria of a plutonium regeneration plant, and not a 
laboratory. According to IAEA estimates, 80 percent of the 
construction and 40 percent of the installation and adjustment 
work have already been completed. It will begin operating at 
full capacity within 4-5 years and will cost hundreds of 
millions of dollars. 
  In March 1990 North Korea reported that a gram of plutonium 
had been isolated from the spent fuel of the 5-MW research 
reactor in the regeneration plant. In connection with this, 
Western experts suggested that the plutonium isolation projects 
could have been going on for a long time, and not only in the 
facility in Nenben, but also in special laboratories at 
Pyongyang University, with its projects in experimental nuclear 
physics, and the so-called "hot cells" the USSR had delivered to 
the DPRK in the 1970s as elements of the research reactor. In 
addition, they did not exclude the possibility of an underground 
plant for the regeneration of plutonium, serving as a unique 
link between laboratory projects and the industrial production 
of plutonium. None of this answered the main question: How much 
weapons-grade plutonium does the DPRK have, and how close is it 
to a nuclear weapon of its own? 
  Reports of intelligence services: A report of the 
Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service had this to say: 
"At this time the DPRK does not have a nuclear weapon.... 
Available data...indicate that the widespread speculation 
regarding the 'breakthrough' in the DPRK's development of its 
own nuclear weapons is seriously doubtful. There is a gap in the 
technological chain the DPRK built back in the 1970s: the 
development of the raw material base--experimental research--the 
generation of fissionable material--the creation of an explosive 
device--tests of the device--the `perfection' of delivery 
vehicles--the development of a nuclear weapon. The break 
occurred in the plutonium generation link."[.sup]3[/] 
  The CIA has a different opinion. According to the head of 
this agency, J. Woolsey, there is the real danger that North 
Korea has enough fissionable material to build at least one 
nuclear device and conceal it from the IAEA. Defense Secretary 
L. Aspin admitted on "Meet the Press" on 14 March 1993 that U.S. 
intelligence had come up with conflicting estimates of the 
amount of plutonium North Korea had produced and conflicting 
opinions as to whether it had enough to build a bomb. 
  The intelligence data the South Korean defense minister 
cited 
when he addressed parliament on 16 March 1993 indicate that 
Pyongyang has the basic nuclear technology and has even tested 
detonators for nuclear devices. Some of the missiles in the DPRK 
arsenal could carry nuclear warheads and could reach any part of 
South Korea, and one type could even reach western Japan. At 
this time the DPRK is working on the SCUD-X missile.[.sup]4[/] 
  According to a report the Japanese Foreign Ministry prepared 
in March 1993, the DPRK is completely capable of obtaining from 
16 to 24 kilograms of plutonium--enough to build an atomic bomb. 
  Missile delivery systems: Short-range missiles of 
the Frog-5 and Frog-7 categories, acquired from the USSR in the 
late 1950s, and updated Soviet-produced SCUD-B missiles and the 
North Korean SCUD-C model make up the basis of North Korea's 
delivery vehicle potential. 
  The DPRK is using technology from Egypt to upgrade SCUD 
missiles acquired earlier from the USSR and is exporting them to 
countries in the Near and Middle East, thereby violating the 
framework set up in 1987 by the leading industrially developed 
countries to control the spread of missiles and missile 
technology. The importers of the missiles include Syria, Iraq, 
and Iran. According to L. Spector from the Carnegie Foundation, 
the DPRK and Iran concluded a special agreement on cooperation 
in missile engineering in 1990, and the PRC assisted the DPRK in 
missile development projects.[.sup]5[/] The North Korean 
medium-range Nodom missile with a range of around 1,000 
kilometers is in the testing stage. According to the Japan 
Defense Agency, in May 1993 North Korea tested the Nodom-1 
medium-range ballistic missile. Experts noted that the missile 
was close to completion and could be deployed soon. 
  All of this has led experts to believe that the DPRK has its 
own missile industry, producing models which might be used as 
delivery vehicles for chemical weapons, and then for nuclear 
weapons after the necessary modifications. 
  The Foreign Intelligence Service reports that the DPRK has 
encountered several objective difficulties in the development of 
the missile industry, primarily due to the shortage of skilled 
personnel, scientists, and engineers and the comparatively low 
technical level of industry. This is why the DPRK is actively 
seeking specialists abroad to attain greater success in missile 
engineering and turn it into a competitive branch.[.sup]6[/] 
The territory of the former Soviet Union has been named as one 
of the locations of this search. With a view to contacts of long 
standing, the DPRK expects the crisis in the military industry 
to result in a brain drain and the solicitation of export 
orders. Russian Security Minister V. Barannikov reported in 
December 1992 that his service had thwarted the attempts of more 
than 30 rocket scientists to cross the border in order to go to 
work in a third country. A more specific later report said that 
they were going to the DPRK.[.sup]7[/] The Russian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs issued a protest to the DPRK and threatened 
the severance of relations unless Pyongyang stopped its attempts 
to lure Russian scientists and specialists to the DPRK. 
  The DPRK's airborne delivery systems are MIG-25 and MIG-29 
planes it bought from the USSR. 
  IAEA control: As mentioned above, it was not until 
January 1992 that a delegation from the DPRK signed an agreement 
on nuclear safeguards with the IAEA in Vienna. Pyongyang pledged 
to grant IAEA inspectors access to its nuclear facilities. This 
occurred more than seven years after the DPRK had become party 
to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The main reason for this long 
delay was North Korea's demand for the removal of U.S. nuclear 
weapons from the southern half of the Korean peninsula. 
  The U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea were covered by the 
U.S.-USSR agreement (September 1991) on the elimination of land- 
and sea-based tactical nuclear weapons. In December 1991 Seoul 
officially announced that all American nuclear weapons had been 
withdrawn. That was also the time when the DPRK and the Republic 
of Korea signed an agreement on reconciliation, non-aggression, 
bilateral exchanges, and cooperation and the document declaring 
the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free zone. In 1992 there were 
several official announcements by the President and defense 
secretary of the United States that tactical nuclear weapons had 
been withdrawn from Asia and Europe. Independent American 
experts W. Arkin and R. Norris confirmed the fact that 151 
nuclear weapons had been removed from South Korea. In 1992 the 
United States and South Korea cancelled the "Team Spirit" annual 
combat maneuvers as a goodwill gesture. 
  When the DPRK was signing the agreement with the IAEA, it 
submitted a list of nuclear facilities and the nuclear materials 
in its possession. The list said that North Korea had derived 
several grams of plutonium from the spent fuel of an 
experimental reactor. Pyongyang assured the IAEA that 
representatives of the agency could visit any sites they wished, 
including installations which were not on the official list of 
facilities subject to inspection. 
  In November 1992 IAEA technical experts were studying the 
discrepancy between the radioactive content of the small 
quantity of plutonium and the products of reactor waste. 
Although the quantity of plutonium North Korea had declared was 
far below the amount required to build a nuclear weapon, the 
discrepancy led to the understandable suspicion that the amount 
of plutonium produced might exceed the amount declared. 
  The IAEA inspectors hoped to answer this question by first 
gaining access to the reactor core, to check how many fuel rods 
had been removed for the extraction of plutonium, and then 
visiting two suspicious facilities in Nenben. North Korean 
spokesmen said the reactor could not be inspected until it had 
been shut down, so that the rods could be removed. The agency 
hoped that the scheduled replacement and, consequently, the 
inspection might occur between April and October 1993. 
  Meanwhile, the North Korean Government had refused the IAEA 
access to the suspected nuclear waste storage sites on the 
grounds that these were military installations and that they had 
no connection to the nuclear program. The North Korean Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs said that the heads of the IAEA had no right 
to use U.S. intelligence information as grounds for a so-called 
"special inspection," presupposing the inspection of non-nuclear 
facilities. The IAEA stood its ground and warned the DPRK that 
the matter would be discussed by the IAEA Board of Governors, 
which passed a resolution on 25 February 1993, requesting the 
DPRK to grant IAEA inspectors access to the suspicious 
facilities within a month. The arguments between the DPRK and 
IAEA reached their peak when the United States and South Korea 
resumed the annual "Team Spirit" maneuvers. It was then that 
Pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. 
  A DPRK Foreign Ministry note of 15 March stressed that the 
discrepancy between official information and the results of 
agency measurements was the product of the IAEA Secretariat's 
fabrications. The DPRK protested the 25 February resolution on 
the "special inspection" and said it was withdrawing from the 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in defense of 
its own sovereignty. 
  At a special meeting on 18 March 1993 the IAEA Board of 
Governors passed a resolution expressing concern over the DPRK's 
announced withdrawal from the treaty, stressing that the 
agreement on safeguards with the DPRK was still in force, and 
requesting the DPRK to reconsider its decision and help the 
agency clear up the inconsistencies the inspections had 
revealed. This was the main topic of discussion at another 
meeting of the board on 31 March 1993. 
  Experts have said that it is of fundamental importance for 
the IAEA to learn the truth about the DPRK's nuclear program. 
After the IAEA failed to detect Iraq's nuclear weapons program 
before the war in the Persian Gulf, it became the target of 
harsh criticism and its effectiveness was in doubt. In the case 
of the DPRK, the agency intended to do its job thoroughly, and 
if North Korea were to refuse inspections in the three months 
remaining before the expiration of its treaty membership, the 
IAEA was prepared to turn the matter over to the UN Security 
Council. 
<H5>  Possible Motives </H5>
  Experts and specialists have three explanations for the 
DPRK's decision to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  The first explanation essentially says that 
Pyongyang wants to continue working on the military atomic 
program it adopted in the 1970s without being bound by political 
commitments or feeling the need to conceal its nuclear 
preparations from the IAEA. 
  In this case, the decision to deny the inspectors access to 
the suspect facilities and prevent the determination of the 
precise quantity of plutonium produced seems completely logical. 
After the lessons the IAEA had learned from the inspections of 
nuclear installations in Iraq, when the latter had managed to 
conceal the degree and scales of its progress in the development 
of nuclear weapons, Pyongyang could hardly expect to fool the 
agency experts for long. Eventually, sooner or later, the IAEA 
would discover the military atomic program, and then the 
Security Council would take the same measures it had taken in 
the case of Iraq. These denuclearization measures still do not 
apply to countries which are not party to the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty and do have secret military nuclear programs, such as 
Israel, India, and Pakistan. That meant that it was politically 
more convenient for a country striving to develop a nuclear 
weapon not to be a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  What lay behind the decision to create atomic potential? 
When 
American nuclear weapons had been deployed in South Korea and 
American military and political leaders had implied several 
times during the cold war that they were prepared to launch them 
at the first sign of hostilities between North and South Korea, 
the DPRK's motives had been unequivocal--it wanted to neutralize 
the nuclear threat from the south with its own weapons. The main 
motive for the development of nuclear weapons disappeared, 
however, after the removal of the American weapons from the 
peninsula. 
  In spite of this, experts have noted that military and 
political factors are still influencing the DPRK's choice in 
favor of nuclear weapons. After Russia's denunciation of the 
treaty on friendship and mutual assistance with the DPRK in 
1992, accompanied by its development of political and economic 
relations with the Republic of Korea, and after the PRC had 
recognized the Republic of Korea, self-reliance, including 
reliance on its own potential nuclear strength, acquired 
decisive significance. At a time when the north was clearly 
losing the economic competition, people in Pyongyang may have 
believed that atomic potential could become the main political 
instrument and means of leverage in bilateral relations with 
Seoul. They probably expected the development of weapons of mass 
destruction to confer greater stability on the regime of Kim 
Il-song and his dynasty in the country. 
  In addition to all of this, as long as nuclear weapons are a 
symbol of military and political might, they will be a cherished 
dream of states hoping to play a prominent role in their own 
regions and in international affairs. This applies not only to 
the DPRK, but also to Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya, not to 
mention such de facto nuclear states as Israel, India, and 
Pakistan. All kinds of surprises can be expected from these 
states--from the secret development of atomic potential to open 
withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty. This has been 
pointed out repeatedly by prominent experts in the United States 
and in Russia.[.sup]8[/] 
  The second explanation is that the DPRK wants to 
gain maximum advantage from a promise to give up its advanced 
nuclear arms program in exchange for military, political, and 
economic dividends in its relations with South Korea, the United 
States, and Japan. People in Pyongyang might believe that these 
states will pay a higher price for access to the DPRK's atomic 
facilities than the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from the 
southern half of the Korean peninsula. 
  Pursuant to the declaration of the nuclear-free zone, the 
DPRK and the Republic of Korea established a joint commission 
for nuclear verification. It was supposed to define the scales 
and principles of bilateral inspections. The commission met 
several times in 1992, but its work reached an impasse when the 
two sides could not reconcile their differences of opinion: 
South Korea, with its diversified atomic industry, including 10 
nuclear power plants which have been covered by IAEA safeguards 
since 1975, proposed an equal number of inspections of atomic 
facilities and other military installations; the DPRK said the 
facilities in Nenben could be inspected in exchange for access 
to all American bases in South Korea, to verify the absence of 
nuclear weapons there. 
  North Korea continued to allege that there were nuclear 
weapons in the south of the peninsula, despite South Korean 
President Roh Tae Woo's statement about the lack of those 
weapons in the country, and asserted that nuclear-powered 
submarines with nuclear weapons on board were still sailing into 
the American submarine base in Chinju. The South Korean 
representatives responded by denying the existence of nuclear 
weapons and military bases for nuclear submarines on their 
territory and said that Seoul would agree to mutual inspections 
of installations, but the demand for unilateral inspections of 
the South Korean military bases was unacceptable. 
  Some experts feel that Pyongyang might decide to return to 
the Non-Proliferation Treaty if it gets firm guarantees of the 
absence of nuclear weapons on American bases and of the 
withdrawal of all American troops (36,000 men) from the 
territory of South Korea. The idea of turning the Korean 
peninsula into a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, 
including nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile weapons, 
could contribute to the security of the peninsula. This opinion 
was expressed by Russian President B. Yeltsin in the South 
Korean National Assembly in November 1992. The only question 
concerns the means of accomplishing this. 
  The resumption of the "Team Spirit" maneuvers had an 
indisputably negative effect on the North-South dialogue on 
nuclear verification issues. The United States' declared 
willingness to reduce its military presence on the Korean 
peninsula dramatically by the year 2000, however, could be a 
step in the right direction. It is precisely the American 
military presence and the security of the DPRK that could be 
used, according to some experts, as bargaining chips to 
encourage the DPRK to return to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  The third explanation combines elements of the 
first and second. On the one hand, Pyongyang may have decided 
that withdrawal from the treaty would give it more freedom to 
pursue its nuclear preparations and, on the other, the further 
it progresses in the development of weapons of mass destruction, 
the higher price it can charge for its return to the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. Furthermore, it is even possible that 
Pyongyang has chosen the extremely risky course of openly 
declaring itself a nuclear state at some time in the future, so 
that it can negotiate security issues on the Korean peninsula on 
a fundamentally new level and demand the complete withdrawal of 
U.S. troops in exchange for the renunciation of its nuclear 
status. 
  Today it is difficult to judge which of these explanations 
is 
an accurate description of the motives behind the DPRK's 
decision to withdraw from the treaty. 
<H5>  International Reaction </H5>
  The overwhelming majority of countries in the world, both 
industrially developed states and developing countries, 
expressed serious misgivings about the DPRK's announcement. 
  The United States: At a press conference on 16 
March this year, President B. Clinton expressed the "deep 
concern" of the United States, and the hope that Pyongyang would 
reconsider its decision during the 90 days between the 
announcement and the date the decision would go into effect. 
Observers noted the subdued nature of the U.S. reaction. When 
Secretary of State W. Christopher addressed the House 
Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs on 25 March, he said: "The 
United States is still working with the IAEA, the United 
Nations, and the Asian countries to persuade North Korea not to 
withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty and its inspection 
framework. There is still time for this work to produce results. 
We feel that sanctions against North Korea might be effective. 
If we reach the point of UN actions against North Korea, there 
will be several ways of exerting pressure.... We do not want to 
reach that point, however, and we hope that North Korea will 
acknowledge its error." 
  Meanwhile, U.S. military and political leaders were 
suggesting that if the DPRK did not change its mind, it might be 
advisable to consider launching a "limited strike" at its 
nuclear installations. In particular, Congressman J. Murtha 
suggested this. Commentators said, however, that this could 
start a war on the Korean peninsula. The Clinton administration 
does not want this to happen. 
  Russia: Russian Foreign Ministry spokesmen 
described the DPRK's decision as an unprecedented, disturbing, 
and dangerous move and expressed the hope that North Korea would 
change its mind. A special meeting of the IAEA Board of 
Governors was convened at Russia's suggestion. The idea of 
convening a special conference of five states--North and South 
Korea, the United States, the PRC, and Russia--was discussed in 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Commentators have noted, 
however, that Russia has had no major way of influencing the 
DPRK after the almost complete cessation of shipments of Russian 
raw materials and arms to North Korea. 
  The PRC: As an ally of the DPRK, Beijing did not 
express its opinion, and it did not confirm its role as a 
mediator in the DPRK's relations with the United States. The 
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did stress, however, its 
support for a nuclear-free zone on the Korean peninsula. 
  Japan: On 19 March 1993 Prime Minister K. Miyazawa 
expressed deep regret over the DPRK's announcement, but he asked 
the international community to give Pyongyang a chance to 
reconsider its decision before taking any measures against the 
DPRK. Japanese Defense Minister M. Sukuma said that the chance 
of war on the Korean peninsula was slim, although it could not 
be called non-existent. Tokyo implied that economic aid to the 
DPRK would be out of the question until the nuclear issue had 
been settled. According to reports in newspapers, Japan, the 
United States, and the Republic of Korea agreed to submit the 
"Korean question" to the Security Council for consideration 
unless the DPRK changed its mind. 
  Republic of Korea: Seoul had the most frightened 
reaction. It asked the countries of the world to exert pressure 
on Pyongyang. South Korea put the 650,000 personnel in its armed 
forces (the DPRK has 1.1 million) on red alert. According to 
reports in the press, Seoul planned to ask Washington not to 
withdraw the 14,000 American soldiers participating in the "Team 
Spirit" maneuvers, its B-1B bombers, and the Patriot air defense 
systems from the country and to keep the aircraft carrier 
Independence near the Korean coastline. Seoul warned that it 
would refuse to finance economic cooperation with Pyongyang if 
the latter did not change its mind. Expenditures on cooperation 
were supposed to amount to 1.2 billion dollars in 1995, as 
compared to 126 million in 1992. 
  Implications: The DPRK's decision could have 
far-reaching negative implications for the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. It could set a dangerous precedent, and North Korea's 
example could be followed by the states that have been irritated 
by IAEA inspections for a long time because they complicate 
secret projects in the nuclear sphere. Experts have included 
Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya among the future "deserters." This 
could reinforce the reluctance of several "threshold" countries, 
such as Brazil and Argentina, to become party to the treaty, and 
it could strengthen the determination of such countries as 
Israel, India, Pakistan, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan to stay outside 
the non-proliferation framework. 
  If the DPRK continues to follow the nuclear path and 
acquires 
nuclear weapons of its own, this event, experts agree, could 
have the most dramatic implications for the non-proliferation 
framework. In this case, South Korea will have to reconsider its 
attitude toward nuclear weapons and might decide to develop 
them, particularly in view of the fact that it has the 
industrial base for this. If an arms race starts on the Korean 
peninsula, Japan is unlikely to stay out of it, and it might 
have to begin the agonizing reassessment of its own traditional 
non-nuclear stance. Experts believe that Japan could have its 
own nuclear weapon within a year after this decision has been 
made. This would have global implications. Other Asian 
countries, especially Taiwan, are also likely to join the race. 
Experts have pointed out the fact that the DPRK is already 
capable of exporting technology and materials to other states in 
violation of the nuclear non-proliferation framework. This 
capability will grow stronger with time. 
  Developments: After the DPRK refused to allow the 
inspection of the suspicious facilities, the IAEA asked the UN 
Security Council for help. The council met behind closed doors 
on 12 May. The press reported that two definite points of view 
were expressed during the discussion of this issue. The 
supporters of the first (the United States and other Western 
countries) insisted on severe economic sanctions against the 
DPRK for its refusal to allow the IAEA inspection and its 
decision to withdraw from the treaty. The advocates of the 
second (the PRC and Pakistan) took a more neutral stance by 
proposing a resolution requesting the DPRK to reconsider its 
decision and return to the treaty ranks. The result was a 
comparatively mild resolution, simply mentioning that the 
Security Council would consider taking concrete and severe 
measures if the DPRK did not comply with the request to return 
to the treaty. It was passed by 13 votes, with two abstentions 
(China and Pakistan), and it requested North Korea's observance 
of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  Paradoxically, the failure of the Security Council to 
approve 
economic sanctions against the DPRK could be of great benefit to 
the prestige and the future of the non-proliferation framework. 
A resolution on economic sanctions might have compromised the 
treaty itself and invalidated Article 10, acknowledging the 
right of parties to withdraw from the treaty. In this case, the 
treaty would have lost one of its fundamental principles--the 
principle of voluntary membership. Instead of remaining a free 
association, it might have turned into a compulsory union, which 
is certain to have undermined its prestige. 
  The very fact that this problem arose is an indication that 
the mere existence of the treaty is not enough to guarantee the 
actual non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The United Nations 
has to have a stronger role in enforcing the treaty. This can 
only be done if the Security Council adopts a special 
declaration on non-proliferation, stipulating possible responses 
to similar problems in the future, whether they involve 
withdrawal from the treaty or the open declaration of nuclear 
status. The five permanent members of the Security Council 
should begin drafting a declaration obligating the nuclear 
states to eliminate their arsenals, and the non-nuclear states 
to never create them. This declaration could be the deciding 
factor in the reinforcement of the non-proliferation framework. 
  During the discussion in the Security Council, the DPRK 
complained to the United States that Washington was continuing 
to deploy nuclear weapons in South Korea and that the discussion 
of nuclear issues could only be continued within the framework 
of bilateral talks with the United States. The American 
representative to the United Nations said that Washington was 
willing to conduct these negotiations and stressed that the 
United States had no intention of attacking North Korea and did 
not have any nuclear weapons in South Korea. 
  The apparent possibility of breaking the deadlock was 
realized in bilateral American-North Korean talks in New York 
and Geneva (June-July). The first round resulted in the 
publication of a joint statement, which said that the DPRK was 
rescinding its announced withdrawal from the treaty. 
  This certainly can be viewed as a victory in the struggle to 
uphold the authority and prestige of the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty. 
  It is too early, however, to say that the crisis has been 
surmounted, because the DPRK is still insisting that IAEA 
inspectors will not be allowed access to the suspect facilities. 
  Prospects: At this time it is difficult for 
experts to guess how the crisis will end. On the one hand, 
Pyongyang's political ambitions and the scales and progress of 
its nuclear program indicate an obvious desire to acquire 
nuclear weapons of its own. On the other, the fact that all five 
permanent members of the UN Security Council are party to the 
treaty, and that they acknowledged the need for a consistent 
fight against the proliferation of nuclear weapons in January 
1992, suggests that the crisis might be resolved through joint 
efforts, especially now that the overwhelming majority of 
industrially developed and developing non-nuclear countries 
share the "big five's" insistence on the need to strengthen the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty and its framework. Experts believe that 
the international community is facing its first test since the 
war in the Persian Gulf, and only time will tell how it will end.
