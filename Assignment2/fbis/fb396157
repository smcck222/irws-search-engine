  [Text] It has become clear that the Nodong-I ballistic 
missiles being produced by the DPRK (North Korea) are mobile. 
This was revealed by an international military source on 23 
December. If these missiles are operationally deployed in the 
condition of being able to be moved around, most likely it will 
become difficult for Japan to intercept them when they are fired 
at this country or for the U.S. armed forces to attack the 
missiles in case of contigencies. The source predicted that the 
Nodong-I missiles will be operationally deployed next year. 
  According to the Defense Agency, North Korea succeeded in 
test-firing a Nodong-I missile into the Sea of Japan in late 
May. At that time, missiles were launched from a fixed 
launching pad on the coast facing the Sea of Japan. As such, it 
was thought that changing missile launching positions would be 
difficult. But the analysis of information carried out by Japan 
and the United States has revealed that the missiles can use 
mobile launching platforms as well. Because the missiles are so 
large, however, it is said that they cannot be launched from a 
sea vessel. 
  The Defense Agency at present assumes the range of the 
Nodong-I to be about 1,000 km, and it has made public the 
results of its analysis which indicate that all of Japan, with 
the exception of only part of Hokkaido, lies within this range. 
  Even when the Nodong-I missiles become mobile, their range 
will not change much, but because they will not use fixed 
missile bases, it is thought that it will be difficult to 
predict where the missiles will be launched from. 
  Furthermore, because North Korea is proceeding to place its 
military facilities underground, a top Defense Agency official 
said, "It will become difficult for the U.S. armed forces to 
attack the missile facilities even if they want to."

  [Excerpt] Bonn/Zagreb (DPA) -- Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman today accused the Muslims of using chlorine gas shells 
in the fighting in central Bosnia. Following the departure of 
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, with whom Tudjman had held 
talks at a two-day conference in Bonn, Tudjman also accused the 
Muslims of continued offensives. However, he described the 
Bosnia-Croatian conference at the Petersberg government guest 
house as useful. 
  Even after Tudjman's remarks, it remained unclear whether 
there would be a cease-fire in central Bosnia. Izetbegovic said 
yesterday evening on ZDF [Second German Television Channel] that 
"no major results" had been achieved. Both presidents are now 
preparing for a new round of talks on 18 January in Geneva, this 
time involving all warring parties from the conference on former 
Yugoslavia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Santoro; copyrighted by CLARIN] </F>
  [Text] After systematically refusing to sign the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (TNP) for 25 years, Argentina will 
finally do so in 1994. This announcement was made, quite 
unexpectedly, by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. 
  This announcement constitutes a turnabout by the Peronist 
government in yet another traditional stance of Argentina's 
foreign policy, namely the reluctance to sign this treaty 
because it entailed a legal and political "inequality" between 
nuclear countries and nonnuclear ones. 
  During an end-of-the-year toast with journalists, Di Tella 
tried to dampen the effects his announcement will trigger. "In 
our capacity as TNP members we will seek, in 1995, that nuclear 
powers disarm," he said in a matter-of-fact way. He thus 
produced an argument that goes against the historical stance of 
Argentine diplomacy, which had rejected the treaty on the 
grounds it was "the disarmament of those countries that have no 
[nuclear] weapons," according to what was officially reported. 
  Taking stock of the results of the country's foreign policy 
this year, the foreign minister elaborated on "the new security 
policy." 
  "We have implemented a security policy particularly based on 
the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, be they 
nuclear, chemical, or missile," he underscored following an 
aide-memoire that he himself had written to deliver the 
end-of-the-year speech, which nobody expected. 
  He then enumerated some of the measures taken to abandon the 
Foreign Ministry's traditional positions in this area: 
  -- "Our vocation for peace has led us to be totally open 
about the Argentine nuclear program by signing an 
all-encompassing agreement on safeguards with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency and furthering a joint nuclear policy with 
Brazil." Until democracy was reinstated in our country in 1983, 
the United States and other industrial countries suspected that 
our country had a secret nuclear program to develop the atomic 
bomb. 
  -- "We have promoted agreements on the banning of chemical 
weapons, first at the regional level (the so-called Mendoza 
Declaration) and then at international level under the aegis of 
the United Nations." By virtue of the aforementioned 
declaration, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile committed themselves 
to renouncing chemical, bacteriological, or biological weapons. 
It has for time immemorial been surmised that Chile had 
developed chemical weapons in a clandestine way, but it has been 
denied by the current democratic Chilean Government. 
  -- "Furthermore, we proposed amendments to the Tlatelolco 
Treaty together with Brazil and Chile." Congress ratified this 
treaty on 11 November -- after waiting 25 years -- despite the 
Radical Party's opposition. The Tlatelolco Treaty establishes a 
nuclear-free zone in Latin America. The amendments Di Tella 
refers to have to do with the interest Argentina has in 
preserving its industrial secrets, like the method for 
processing enriched uranium developed by the National Commission 
for Atomic Energy (CNEA) at the Pilcaniyeu plant in Neuquen 
Province. 
  -- "We also have discontinued the Condor-2 missile project 
and established the National Commission for Space Activities, 
which is in charge of retrofitting the Falda del Carmen plant 
(where the missile was developed) and developing satellites." 
Following infighting in its own party and a dispute with the 
Radicals, this administration dismantled the missile in 1991 and 
sent its components to the United States this year. It has not 
yet honored its promise to recycle the aforementioned plant into 
a technological research center for peaceful uses. 
  Contradiction 
  The unexpected announcement by Di Tella on 29 December 
contradicts his own remarks to CLARIN on 8 March 1982, when he 
announced that the government had decided to promote in Congress 
the Tlatelolco Treaty's ratification, but denied the country 
would sign the TNP. 
  Argentina had signed the Tlatelolco Treaty, though its 
ratification by Congress still was pending until November, 
whereas it always refused to sign the TNP. Now the government 
will request signing the agreement and then will have to submit 
it to Congress for ratification so the treaty can take effect. 
What remains to be seen is the UCR's [Radical Civic Union] 
stance on this new and bold step taken by the government.

<F P=106> [Article by Julie Flint: "Renegade Iraqi Scientist Details </F>
Gas Atrocities"] 
  [Text] Birds fell from the sky, green reeds turned yellow, 
bodies blistered. Military papers found in the possession of a 
dead Iraqi officer authorised the use of chemical weapons "as a 
last resort." 
  Pressure for the United Nations to investigate alleged gas 
attacks in the marshes of southern Iraq grew yesterday as Dr 
Hussein Sharistani, once Iraq's leading nuclear scientist, 
arrived in Britain with details of a month-long inquiry into 
allegations that Saddam Hussein had again used chemical weapons 
against his own people. 
  The allegations of the attack on the Hammar marshes coincide 
with reports that President Saddam has begun draining the most 
populous part of the marshlands, the north-eastern region. The 
memory of massacres is so vivid there that the Iraqi opposition 
has for the first time instructed local people not to offer 
resistance. 
  Since the attack on the Hammar marshes at the end of 
September, Gulf War Victims, an independent research group 
founded by Dr Sharistani and his Canadian wife, Bernice, has 
interviewed "practically every man who witnessed the battle." 
  This evidence, and other information collected from the 
marsh 
region, will be presented to the Foreign Office this week in the 
hope that Britain will press for a full investigation. 
  Although Gulf War Victims has been unable to confirm the 
exact nature of the gas used, it has pieced together a detailed 
picture of the attack and the events that followed it. Dr 
Sharistani, held in solitary confinement for 10 years before 
being released from jail in 1991, is confident that UN 
investigators can be led to the spot where hundreds of people 
were reported to have died from shells that killed without 
wounding. 
  "Everyone we have spoken to agreed these projectiles were 
unlike any others they had seen," Dr Sharistani said yesterday. 
"They were liquid and made little noise when they exploded. The 
smell was different from other shells; there wasn't the usual 
burning smell." 
  Witnesses said the attack on the Hor Alawi area on the 
eastern edge of the Hammar marshes began early on September 26, 
when dozens of armoured vehicles advanced with artillery. The 
attack was beaten off by resistance fighters, who had occupied 
Hor Alawi after the drainage of the Amara marshes flooded the 
area north of the Euphrates. 
  "The resistance captured six armoured vehicles," Dr 
Sharistani said. "In one of them they discovered a briefcase 
with a notebook containing the minutes of a meeting. The third 
point in these minutes said that if they could not dislodge the 
rebels from the area, they should use chemical weapons as a last 
resort." 
  Survivors said shells fired by the Iraqis emitted a thick, 
white, ball-shaped gas cloud that hung a few yards above the 
ground for about an hour, causing breathing difficulties. 
  Some said there was a smell of rotten apples -- a smell 
Iraqis associate with chemical weapons used during the war with 
Iran. All said the Iraqi soldiers carried gas masks and filters 
attached to chest straps. 
  The resistance abandoned Hor Alawi at nightfall after 
running 
out of ammunition. As they retreated, Dr Sharistani said, they 
fired shells captured during the battle. Two or three days 
later, informers in the marshes said hundreds of Iraqi troops 
had been killed. The bodies had no visible wounds, but were 
blistered and discoloured. 
  The informers said army casualties had filled military 
hospitals in Basra, Qurna and Medainah. Local people reported 
numerous mourning ceremonies in the days after the attack, and 
said Iraqi troops took the unusual step of burning the bodies of 
dead civilians. 
  Iraqi diplomats in New York have denied the use of chemical 
weapons. UN officials are seeking access to the marshes to 
ascertain whether chemicals or a combination of other lethal 
agents were used.

<F P=106> [Report by Annika Savill: "`Butcher' Directs Attack on </F>
Shias"] 
  [Text] 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, a cousin of Saddam Husayn who 
rose to fame as the butcher of Kurdistan and Kuwait, is the man 
in charge of depopulating the southern marshes through 
executions, chemical attacks and desertification. 
  General al-Majid, dubbed "Ali Chemical" in Iraq, has been 
made acting Governor of al-Basrah in addition to his position 
as Defence Minister. From there, he personally supervised the 
chemical attacks in September against the Shias in the marshes, 
according to Husayn Shahristani, formerly Iraq's top nuclear 
scientist. 
  The General is an expert in genocide and depopulation; he 
was 
personally responsible for poison-gas attacks against the Kurds 
- such as the one on the town of Halabjah in 1988 - during 
Saddam's "Arabisation" drive in the north. 
  He extended the system of forced removal under which some 
100,000 Kurds fled the country. In 1990, he was made governor 
of the newly annexed Kuwait. There, he oversaw the exodus of 
civilians while attempting to conscript Kuwaiti men into his 
Iraqi army. 
  Now, General al-Majid is turning his talents to a 
three-pronged programme finally to depopulate the southern 
marshes. "When Saddam realised the southermost marshes were not 
drained, and the rains started again after the summer, he 
decided to speed up the exercise," Dr Shahristani, on a visit to 
London, told the Independent. So in addition to the draining 
that has turned most of the south into a modern desert, General 
al-Majid launched a chemical attack on the population on 26 
September. "He has sent word to the Shia fighters that that he 
will do to them what he did to the Kurds," said Dr Shahristani. 
  He is also rounding up Shia men and executing them 
summarily. 
Dr Shahristani, himself a Shia, has met relatives who have had 
to claim the bodies from Abu Ghurayb jail in Baghdad. They 
speak of decomposition beyond the stage of identification. 
  Dr Shahristani, who quit Iraq's nuclear energy programme in 
1979, said the chemicals used in the south were different from 
those used in Halabjah. "These are newly made, with tear-gas 
and a cocktail mix of lethal ingredients. These do not require 
much equipment. They can be made in university laboratories, or 
the equipment can easily be buried." 
  Eyewitnesses have told Dr Shahristani the chemicals were 
fired in shells by mortar. They spoke of "bodies changing 
colour to yellow or orange with blisters". As many Iraqi 
soldiers appeared to have died as Shia civilians. The soldies 
fell with their gas masks on. Only the victims strong enough to 
walk to the Iranian border have got out to tell the tale. 
  dr Shahristani will today take his case to the Foreign 
Office. UN inspectors,charged with ensuring Saddam complies with 
resolutions to destroy weapons of mass destruction, are due to 
visit the area soon. Six weeks on, it is expected the evidence 
will be difficult to find.

<F P=106> [Article by Steve Rodan; Hillel Kutler contributed to this </F>
report: "Target Ready; Can the Arrow Missile Project Make the 
Grade and Convince Its Detractors of its Worth?"] 
  [Text] May 29, 1993. A blast rocked the eastern coast of 
the Sea of Japan. North Korea had launched the first test flight 
of its secret Nodung missile. It sailed 500 kilometers toward 
Japan and fell into the sea. 
  In Tokyo, the Japanese were in a panic. They knew well that 
the Nodung could have easily flown its maximum range of 1,000 
kilometers and crashed into Japan. 
  In Washington, U.S. strategists upgraded the missile threat 
from Pyongyang from potential to real and decided that the 
communist country required high-level attention. 
  Within hours, the news was relying to Jerusalem, Yitzhaq 
Rabin and his military aides agreed that a turning point had 
been reached. North Korea was a friend of Syria and Iran. The 
Arabs now had a missile that could strike the Jewish state from 
launchers out of the effective range of the Israel Air Force 
[IAF]. 
  To Rabin, it was the realization of a frightening thought he 
had been expressing for at least a year. Israel could eventually 
face thousands of medium-range missiles deployed by radical Arab 
leaders swept into the euphoria of jihad, holy war. 
Should Israel make a preemptive strike, hundreds of missiles 
could rain down on it. If not, Israel would be forced to submit 
to a dangerous and humiliating surrender. 
  Rabin's conclusion was that Israel must step up the 
development of what could be its most ambitious and, perhaps, 
most expensive project ever: the Arrow (Hetz) anti-missile 
defense system. To its supporters, the Arrow can be Israel's 
answer to the growing Arab missile threat and a card to play in 
future Middle East diplomacy. To its opponents, the Arrow is a 
wasteful project that will bankrupt the government and never 
work. 
  These days, both proponents and opponents are nervous. In 
the 
coming days, the Arrow will undergo the first of three tests to 
determine whether it can actually intercept and destroy the 
warhead of an incoming enemy missile. If the tests fail, 
opponents could succeed in reducing the scope of the project. If 
the tests succeed, Israeli officials will decide to prepare for 
the production and deployment of a system which no other nation 
has. 
  "The next three tests will be crucial, not only for the 
technological hurdles but also psychologically," says former 
defense minister Moshe Arens, an Arrow supporter. "If they fail, 
then they [in the government] won't want to continue." 
  Both sides agree that Israel faces a growing Arab missile 
threat. Syria is acquiring Scud C missiles from North Korea. 
Egypt is investing heavily in missile production as well. 
Military sources acknowledge the eventual threat of 2,000 Arab 
enemy missiles being aimed at Israel. 
  "The danger of missiles is a real threat," says Deputy 
Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur. "I don't know who doesn't 
appreciate this great danger." 
  Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yisrael Tal, one of the top military 
strategists in Israel, says the Arabs have reached a strategic 
balance with Israel through their acquisition of 
ground-to-ground missiles. "We have lost the monopoly of 
strategic deterrence, and there is a threat that it will pass 
over to the Arabs," Tal is quoted in Arye Shalev's Peace 
and Security in the Golan, published this year. Tal, a 
senior Defense Ministry official, has not repeated these views 
in public. 
  The argument is over the Israeli response. Until the Gulf 
war, Israel and the U.S. shared the same approach. A missile 
attack could be dealt with by the Air Force, which would search 
and destroy missile batteries. "I was hearing the same story," 
says James Hackett, an executive with Titan Systems and one of 
the leading missile experts in the U.S. "They said, `We don't 
need [anti-missile] missiles. Just give us more airplanes.'" 
  The Pentagon changed that attitude after the war, in which 
29 
soldiers were killed by an Iraqi Scud attack on Saudi Arabia. 
The Israeli military's view has remained the same: absorb a 
first blow, locate the enemy's offenses and then attack hard. 
  "The entire effort is how to reduce the early damage [from a 
missile attack] so the missile launchers can be found," says 
Me'ir Kohen, a missile expert close to the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] leadership. "If we have good intelligence, we can find 
them." 
  The subject has pitted uniformed commanders against defense 
technocrats. It has been a controversy fueled by a wholesale 
disinformation, personal enmities and a bureaucratic battle 
between the IDF and the Defense Ministry. Israel Aircraft 
Industries [IAI], the chief Israeli contractor for the Arrow, 
originally set 1995 for the completion of the Arrow's 
development. Military experts say it will be a miracle if any 
sort of system can be installed by the end of the decade. 
  "It [Arrow] is not practical in the short term," says former 
Air Force commander Avihu Bin-Nun. "The resources are limited. 
If we invest in the offensive answer, then we have versatility." 
  "The missile threat is very small," he adds. "It has been 
blown out of proportion by us. One plane can do more against us 
than all 40 missiles that fell on us [during the Gulf war]." 
  Bin-Nun's view is widely held throughout the military, 
particularly among the commanders who draft budgets. For years, 
the Air Force had little to do with the project. Today, IDF 
strategists, set to review its multi-year program, are planning 
to demand a cut in the Arrow program. 
  In many ways, its a rerun of previous army battles with the 
civilian defense establishment over budgeting huge research and 
development programs. "The army works from a mindset," says 
Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yirmeyahu Olmert, a former secretary to Arens. 
"The army always wants to work tactically and doesn't want to 
look at the long term." 
  The shooting in this battle has been largely behind closed 
doors. Spokesmen for the army and Defense Ministry refused to 
allow interviews on the subject. Few Israeli officials would 
talk, particularly among those with firsthand knowledge. Most, 
like the chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and defense 
committee, Ori Orr, would not. 
  One of the reasons is that the stakes are high. The end of 
the Arrow would be a severe blow to a financially ailing Israel 
Aircraft Industries, the prime Israeli contractor. The Arrow is 
the biggest project involving U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation. 
An expansion of the Arrow program would certainly mean less 
money for other military development projects. 
  The Arrow aims to protect Israel from short-range and 
medium-range ballistic missiles, regardless of whether their 
warheads are conventional, biological, chemical or nuclear. A 
long-range early warning radar would detect the launching of an 
enemy missile hundreds of kilometers away. Another kind of 
radar, called fire-control radar, would track the enemy missile 
as it made its way toward Israel. 
  An Arrow would be fired to intercept and destroy the missile 
before it reached Israel. If the Arrow failed to destroy the 
enemy missile, another Arrow would be launched. 
  The Arrow travels at a speed of Mach-9, nine times the speed 
of sound. 
  For defense of specific points, the U.S. is providing $13.9 
million for a hypervelocity gun, in which plasma is injected 
into the gun barrel behind the shell, thereby doubling the 
shell's speed. The Patriot PAC-3, a planned improvement on the 
missile Israel received during the Gulf war, would also 
intercept short-range tactical missiles. 
  Like most huge projects, the Arrow missile began as a 
political indulgence. It was 1985 and the Reagan administration 
was looking for support for its controversial Strategic Defense 
Initiative, nicknamed Star Wars. The U.S. offered to fund any 
project by any country that would develop an anti-missile 
defense system. 
  The response was lukewarm. IAI, however, came up with a plan 
to develop a missile that could shoot an incoming enemy missile 
out of the sky. The Arrow would be used against ballistic 
missiles with ranges of 1,000 kilometers and intercept them 
about 100 kilometers from target. This would make the Arrow 
ideal protection against unconventional weapons, such as 
chemical or nuclear warheads. 
  U.S. officials were quickly convinced and, by May 1986, 
Israel and the U.S. signed a memorandum of understanding to 
facilitate formal Israeli participation. Two years later, the 
two countries agreed on funding and the beginning of the first 
stage of the arrow experiments. The stage would include four 
tests and cost $158m. The U.S. would pay 80 percent, with Israel 
picking up the rest. 
  In May 1991, the U.S. and Israel announced the second stage 
of the Arrow. It now had a new name, Arrow Continuation 
Experiments (ACES), and a lot more money. The second stage would 
comprise 11 launches, and Washington agreed to pay 72 percent of 
the $322m, with Israel paying the rest. Israel also agreed to 
absolute U.S. control and accepted the condition that it could 
not sell Arrow technology or even use it for other Israeli 
projects. 
  Meanwhile, the debate over the Arrow intensified as the IDF 
poured in more money. Sources in the General Staff pointed out 
that the IDF's pre-Gulf war forecast of Scud damage had been 
overestimated, and grumbled that Israel didn't need a missile 
defense system. Others said Arab missiles were too weak to make 
a difference in war. The Air Force was upset that it did not 
lead a project that it might eventually be asked to purchase and 
deploy. 
  "In the beginning, the IAF was not in the picture," Bin-Nun 
says. "The IAF didn't sign anything. They haven't allowed the 
IAF to lead this. It is a mistake for the IAF to stand on the 
side, to give advice but not have direct responsibility." 
  The biggest question was whether the Arrow was making real 
progress. There was no ready answer. What qualifies as success 
when the project is huge, the technology novel and the exact 
price hard to pin down? 
  "For the IDF, it makes sense not to put all of its money 
into 
one thing it can't back out of," says Ze'ev Eytan, a senior 
researcher and an editor of the annual military survey released 
by the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies. 
  The early launches of the Arrow were difficult. Sources 
close 
to the project say the first, in August 1990, lasted only five 
seconds; news reports said it lasted six seconds. The tracking 
radar failed to operate and the safety officer feared that the 
missile might go off course. The officer aborted the mission and 
instructed the missile to self-destruct. Arrow sources say the 
Pentagon determined that the flight did not constitute a test. 
  The project slipped further. The second Arrow test was on 
March 25, 1991, four months behind schedule. Arrow sources say 
that flight lasted 16 seconds. The central computer of the 
missile overheated from external heat and malfunctioned. 
  The Israelis tried to present the launches in the best 
light. 
They said the first flight was designed to test only the Arrow's 
launching mechanism, engine and computer. As for the second 
test, IAI officials reported that six of the 11 objectives of 
the flight were achieved. 
  The Americans were more blunt. "We didn't get a lot of the 
test objectives done," Col. Harold Richardson of the U.S. 
Strategic Defense Initiative Office told the U.S. magazine 
Defense News. 
  The third test was also delayed as engineers tried to figure 
out what was wrong. That launch, on October 30, 1991, also 
failed, U.S. and Israeli sources say the test started well, but 
the interceptor developed a malfunction and deviated from its 
planned course. 
  The Israelis and Americans decided it was time to regroup, 
U.S. officials in charge of the project determined that the 
Arrow had to take a step back. The American style has always 
been cautious, step-by-step, with advancement only predicated on 
the success of the previous test. However, in the early stage of 
the program, the Israelis would embark on several tasks and see 
which one was progressing. 
  The Israelis involved in the Arrow acknowledged that the 
joint project entailed heightened media exposure, adaptation to 
U.S. R&amp;D standards, as well as a constant reassessment of the 
project. In all, it led to an atmosphere of what some of them 
termed "do or die" before each launch. "I agree that if this was 
an Israeli project we could have taken more chances and be less 
exposed to the public eye," a defense source says. 
  Some of the Americans involved in the Arrow, like most of 
the 
Israelis, saw the silver lining in its failures. They argued 
that the project was still flexible and changes could easily be 
made. "If I had three straight successes, I would be dead 
scared," a U.S. Arrow source says. "My fear would be when my 
failure was going to come." 
  The Americans decided that the Arrow missile first needed to 
be test-fired without a flaw. As a result, the fourth test was 
downgraded. The mission was just to ensure an Arrow flight and 
to maintain contact between the missile and ground control. The 
Arrow would not be tested for its ability to intercept an enemy 
missile. 
  The Israelis involved in the Arrow reviewed many of its 
components. Sources close to the project say IAI engineers made 
up to 70 changes in the Arrow between the third and fourth 
launches. 
  The approach worked. On September 23, 1992, the Arrow was 
fired from a boat and was airborne for 42 seconds. Ground 
control maintained contact with the Arrow and the missile 
performed well. The planners were pleased. 
  Arrow engineers said this was a turning point for the 
project. On February 28, the missile underwent its fifth flight. 
This time, the mission focused on the missile's sensor. An Arrow 
simulating an attacking missile was fired. This was followed by 
a second Arrow, containing an electro-optic sensor. The Arrow's 
sensors found the incoming missile and followed it. The Arrow 
interceptor passed within several meters of the incoming enemy 
missile. The Arrow was not equipped with a live warhead and did 
not destroy the incoming missile. 
  But for the Arrow's planners, this was a bull's eye. They 
said the Arrow had proven that it could -- under optimal 
conditions -- locate and intercept an enemy missile. They said 
had the Arrow been equipped with a warhead, it could have 
destroyed the missile. 
  The sixth and most recent test was in July. The launch was 
aborted when the target missile veered off course. The Pentagon 
and Defense Ministry took more than 30 hours to pass verdict on 
the test. The U.S. ruled the launch did not constitute a test. 
  Israeli and American planners agree that plenty of work 
remains to be done. As Michael Holtcamp, the manager of the 
project, based in Huntsville, Alabama, put it, one slip of the 
Arrow's sensor or radar and the mission is unsuccessful. 
  The Arrow will have three chances to prove this. "The next 
three tests are called lethality tests," Holtcamp says. "That is 
to ensure that the target is killed. We hope to have proven the 
principle in the next three shots." 
  Americans working on the Arrow insist that the mission is 
difficult but possible. They point to the precision-guided 
missiles, particularly the Tomahawks, used by the U.S. during 
the Gulf war. Those missiles were programmed to hit specific 
targets, albeit stationary, and were largely successful. 
  "There are imaging systems out there," says a U.S. source 
close to the Arrow project. "The technology is there. The 
problem is that the application has never been done exactly the 
way it's being planned for the Arrow." 
  Gerald Steinberg, an expert on missiles at Bar-Ilan 
University, agrees that the problem is daunting. "It has never 
been done before." 
  At the same time, project managers are planning significant 
changes to the Arrow. A new missile, called Arrow II, will be 
smaller and lighter; Arrow II will be considered for production, 
while the first Arrow, which is experimental, will not. The new 
version will have two stages as does the current Arrow but it 
will have a longer range. The sensors on the missile will also 
be improved. The new missile is scheduled to undergo seven 
tests, starting in the next few months and continuing until 1996. 
  So far, opponents of the Arrow are not impressed by its 
technological achievements. They say the Arrow is far from even 
proving that it can destroy an enemy missile under optimal 
conditions, let alone under battle conditions. They also doubt 
that the Arrow can effectively protect against nuclear warheads. 
By firing plenty of Scud missiles, an enemy can quickly ensure 
that Israel will use up its supply of valuable Arrows. 
  "IAI engineers are trying to enter completely new fields 
where unknowns dominate," says Reuven Pedatzur, a defense 
researcher who last month released a report on the Arrow for the 
Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies. "In much of the Arrow 
technology, these engineers have no prior professional 
experience. Major breakthroughs will be needed to complete the 
project." 
  Pedatzur says the snags in technological advancement will 
mean more delays in the project and increased costs. The costs 
will include the huge investment in the Arrow's components, such 
as the fire-control radar and early warning systems, which he 
says are not being financed by the U.S. Already, the government 
has budgeted about $120m for the radar system and at least $100m 
more might be needed. Israel wants Washington to finance the 
development of the radar but has not received a commitment. 
  So far, the Defense Ministry has acquired two estimates of 
the Arrow's costs -- that of IAI and the Israeli WALES 
consulting firm. In 1989, IAI estimated the cost of developing 
Arrow missiles and launchers at $1.3 billion. This includes the 
development and purchase of early warning radar, fire-control 
radar and a command-and-control system. A U.S.-developed model 
radar, which operates at a different frequency and is being 
promoted by the Pentagon, would cost about 10 times that much. 
  Defense sources warn against committing anybody to this 
estimate. "I don't think that today IAI can give the right 
numbers," says a defense source. "But it is a lot less than what 
Pedatzur is saying." 
  Pedatzur says the early-warning radar will cost $100m per 
unit and the cost of developing two systems will cost between 
$400m and $500m. Development of the fire-control radar, which 
tracks the incoming enemy missile, is estimated at $200m with 
the price of each unit at between $30m and $50m. The command and 
control system is estimated by Tadiran, which wants the 
contract, at between $40m and $50m. 
  Pedatzur says the cost of the entire Arrow system to the IDF 
could top $6.75b. This would include research, development and 
procurement of 100 launchers and 400 missiles. It would not 
include the costs of a nationwide communications system, 
manpower and training. 
  "This is still not the whole story," Pedatzur says in his 
report. "Other components still in the concept stage will have 
to be developed in the wake of the lessons of the Gulf war. It 
is difficult to gauge these costs, but they will probably run 
into billions of dollars." 
  Brig.-Gen. (res.) Aharon Levran, who has researched the 
Arrow 
for Bar-Ilan University's Center for Strategic Studies, calls 
Pedatzur's estimate baseless and misleading. He dismisses the 
argument by the Arrow's IDF critics who assert that the project 
is not cost-effective; one of their arguments is that it makes 
no sense that a $1m Arrow be used to destroy a $200,000 Scud 
missile. 
  "You can't talk in sterile terms about cost-effectiveness," 
Levran says. "You have to look at the matter as to what damage 
they [incoming missiles] will do and what they do to the 
strategic balance. If this is the central strategic challenge, 
you have to find an answer to this and not hide behind clever 
answers." 
  Still, Pedatzur has plenty of supporters. He has been 
invited 
to discuss his report with the IDF General Staff. In Washington, 
the General Accounting Office [GAO], the congressional watchdog 
of government spending, says in a report released last August 
that Israel might be underestimating the costs of producing and 
deploying the Arrow system. 
  The report says Washington is already providing funding not 
only for the development of the Arrow but for other programs 
related to the completion of the project. The reference is to 
$54.4 million budgeted for the entire Arrow system, including 
its radar system. 
  "The U.S. may be drawn into funding most of the elements 
needed to deploy and support a complete Israeli Arrow missile 
defense system in response to piecemeal Israeli requests," the 
GAO report says. 
  The study raises another question: Will the U.S. allow the 
Arrow to be completed? The GAO cast doubts on whether the Arrow 
is even suitable for Israel's needs, as opposed to another 
missile defense system being developed in the U.S. Precisely 
that argument was expressed when Israel was developing the 
U.S.-financed Lavi fighter-jet a decade ago. At the time, U.S. 
defense contractors demanded that their government stop spending 
taxpayers' money to build a foreign airplane that would 
eventually compete with American products. 
  The IDF, particularly the Air Force, pushed for the end of 
the Lavi, saying it was unworkable and unaffordable. In 1987, 
Israel decided to cancel the billion-dollar Lavi project. Today, 
Lavi supporters assert that Israel cannot afford to buy the 
top-quality U.S. airplanes that will do the job originally 
envisioned for the Lavi. 
  U.S. involvement in the Arrow is on a much smaller scale 
than 
it was on the Lavi. The problem is, what if the Arrow works? Who 
will own and sell it? Under the agreement, the U.S. will own 
all of the Arrow technology developed. But disputes have erupted 
over Israel's claims that it contributed most of the technology. 
  Pentagon officials say the feud is not unusual. The U.S. and 
Japan have argued for years over technology ownership in their 
joint projects. "This is the great lurking problem in all 
technology transfers," says Steven Bryen, a former Pentagon 
official responsible for U.S. technology transfers. 
  Opponents and proponents of the Arrow are looking to 
Washington. They have quietly lobbied Congress and the Pentagon 
for support. Pedatzur has tried to relay his fears on the Arrow 
to U.S. officials. At one point, he says he tried and failed to 
interview Bin-Nun on the Arrow and present this in a hearing in 
Congress. 
  "What's my goal?" asks Pedatzur, who now works for the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "I want a public debate." 
  On the other side is Marvin Klemow. A tough-talking former 
Associated Press reporter now representing IAI in Washington, 
Klemow protects the Arrow as if it were his own child. He and 
other Israelis connected with the arrow have done their best to 
stop Pedatzur--a former military correspondent who still writes 
for Ha'aretz--and others from speaking to Pentagon 
officials and congressional aides. 
  "He was telling people that he was doing an objective study 
for the Jaffee Institute," Klemow says. "We said he was a 
reporter. He never told them that he was also a reporter. So, 
they denied [Pedatzur the chance to meet them]. One 
congressional aide he did see said that every question he did 
ask was meant to elicit negative responses." 
  Throughout, Rabin has maintained a stony silence. Publicly, 
the prime minister and defense minister has never commented on 
the Arrow, leading some military sources to assert that the 
prime minister's heart is not in the project. 
  "I doubt if Rabin has had five minutes to even seriously 
consider the Arrow and its future," a source close to Rabin says. 
  But quietly, the Rabin government has expanded the 
commitment 
to the Arrow. Lt.-Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, the head of the 
Ballistic Missile Development Organization, the U.S. agency 
involved in the Arrow, told Congress last May that Israel is 
committed to completing the development of the Arrow, regardless 
of U.S. aid. Sources close to Rabin say he changed from being an 
opponent to a lukewarm supporter of the project during the Gulf 
war. He became a strong advocate of a missile defense system 
after the May 29 Nodung launch by North Korea. 
  "His position is very supportive [of the Arrow]," says Oded 
Ben-Ami, Rabin's spokesman at the Defense Ministry. "Israel has 
every interest in developing the Arrow and bringing it to 
completion." 
  Later, Rabin gave approval to fund the production of several 
Arrow missiles and a launcher even before the end of the 
U.S.-Israel research-and-development project to find out if the 
system works. Defense sources say money has been budgeted for 
the current fiscal year to prepare for the eventual deployment 
of the Arrow as part of a five-year Israeli plan that ends in 
1997. Defense sources estimate that the deployment is dependent 
on the development of the Arrow radar and it will not be 
achieved before 1995. 
  Moreover, the IDF is now said to be fully cooperating with 
the project. The IAF has recently completed a feasibility study 
and operational assessment of the Arrow. In August, military 
representatives participated in a series of tests to determine 
how the Arrow could defend against an enemy warhead containing 
multiple chemical bombs, each the size of a soft-drink can. 
  "Rabin supports it 100 percent and wants them to prove that 
the Arrow can, or cannot, shoot down an incoming missile," a 
senior defense source says. 
  However, there are doubts regarding the number of missiles 
to 
be produced. That will depend on U.S. aid. "If the Americans 
leave the project, there will be a serious debate," says Gur, 
Rabin's deputy. 
  So far, the Americans have been cautious not to be drawn 
into 
the debate. "U.S. decision-makers should understand that the 
signals they send today will have major ramifications for the 
Israeli approach to the Arrow program," says Marvin Feuerwerger 
in a 1991 study for the Washington Institute for Near East 
Policy. 
  Still, the debate is already being felt in Washington and 
the 
result is that many in Congress and the Pentagon are beginning 
to wonder whether Israel wants the Arrow. Senator Daniel Inouye 
(Democrat-Hawaii) was confused as he made the rounds in Israel 
in July to warn officials that the project was in danger. 
  As a Capitol Hill source put it: "From a purely political 
standpoint, for the U.S. to withdraw support for the Arrow now 
will send a very terrible signal now with regard to support for 
Israel's security and the peace process." 
  Israeli sources said Inouye told Rabin that cancellation of 
Arrow would send the wrong signal to the Arabs. He said he 
didn't understand why so many military men were against the 
Arrow when the lion's share of the costs were paid by Washington. 
  "If you don't know what you want, then I don't know how to 
help you," an Israeli source quoted Inouye as saying. 
  Arens put it another way: "It's really a very daring 
assumption that the U.S. would continue to fund the missile if 
we are not definite about it." 
  Bryen, the former Pentagon official, agrees. "The more the 
Israelis debate it, the more the U.S. will say, `Well, it's too 
controversial.' It's a self-fulfilling prophecy."

<F P=106> [By reporter Gao Jian (7559 1017)] </F>
  [Text] United Nations, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- A Chinese 
representative said here today that only by making a definite 
commitment to the complete prohibition and thorough destruction 
of nuclear weapons and by adopting appropriate and resolute 
steps to that end will the measures of nuclear states to prevent 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons have a genuine significance. 
  The second session of the preparatory committee for the 1995 
conference of parties to the Treaty on Nonproliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons was convened this week at the United Nations 
Headquarters in New York. Sha Zukang, head of the Chinese 
delegation to the session expounded China's views on how to 
effectively prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  Sha Zukang said China recognizes the importance of the 
prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons as well as 
the maintenance of an effective international legal mechanism 
for that purpose. At the same time, China also believes that 
nonproliferation by itself is not the ultimate goal that the 
mankind should pursue, and that the real objective should be 
complete prohibition, thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, 
and realization of a nuclear-free world. 
  Sha Zukang believes that only by making a definite 
commitment 
and by adopting appropriate and resolute steps to that end will 
the measures of nuclear states to prevent the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons have a genuine significance. He said failure to 
do that will perpetuate the defect of the existing imbalance in 
the treaty in the rights and obligations between the nuclear and 
nonnuclear states. To realize quickly the objective of the 
total prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, a 
large number of nonnuclear countries have given up the option of 
acquiring and developing nuclear weapons; however, their demand 
for security guarantees has not been fundamentally satisfied. 
  Sha Zukang said the Chinese Government believes that 
conditions are ripe for all nuclear states to make the 
commitment of not being the first to use nuclear weapons and not 
to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear 
states and nuclear free zones. 
  Sha Zukang criticized some big nuclear powers for a lack of 
sincerity for peace in this respect. He said if nuclear 
states, particularly the big nuclear powers with global nuclear 
attack capability, are unable to take even the limited step of 
guaranteeing that they will not be the first to use nuclear 
weapons and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons 
against nonnuclear states and nuclear free zones, how can they 
expect the large number of nonnuclear states to trust their 
sincerity for peace. 
  He pointed out that it will be difficult to ensure 
universality and enduring effectiveness for the international 
nuclear nonproliferation mechanism if nuclear states only make 
one-sided emphasis on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons 
and if they only emphasize their own absolute security to the 
neglect of the nonnuclear states' legitimate security concerns.

<F P=106> [By Kim Tae-yong] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Jan 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's 
view of North Korea and unification seems little different from 
those of his predecessors, but he does have a stronger desire to 
improve inter-Korean relations than they did. 
  Kim clarified this view on Thursday, after a policy briefing 
from Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok. 
  In the current international situation, where every country 
is competing fiercely, the Korean people cannot survive unless 
they realize unification as soon as possible, he told Yi. 
  Kim instructed his minister to develop inter-Korean 
relations 
so that a South-North Korean commonwealth is established during 
his term in office, which ends in February 1998. 
  Although he is eager to see inter-Korean relations improved, 
he has one condition: Settlement of the North Korean nuclear 
problem. 
  ``The government should solve the nuclear problem, which is 
blocking improvement of inter-Korean relations, this year 
without fail to revitalize inter-Korean reconciliation and 
cooperation,'' he told Yi. 
  Once the nuclear problem is solved, the government should 
push ahead with the promotion of mutual interests and 
improvement of relations, Kim said. 
  ``First of all, the government should make a breakthrough in 
solving the nuclear problem through an exchange of special 
envoys, and then it should push ahead with exchange and 
cooperation with North Korea,'' he said. 
  Inter-Korean relations were cool last year because of the 
suspicions about North Korea's nuclear development program. 
  Kim told Yi that he was sure that North Korea had no choice 
but to change its policies soon, and said that the government 
should use the change as an opportunity to improve inter-Korean 
relations. 
  Since North Korea is in a very difficult situation at home 
and abroad, it cannot avoid changing its policies. When North 
Korea begins to show a willingness to solve the nuclear problem, 
the international situation surrounding the Korean peninsula 
will change rapidly, he said. 
  The government should use the change for a stable 
improvement 
in inter-Korean relations and, ultimately, to realize peaceful 
unification. 
  ``For those goals, the National Unification Board should 
push 
ahead with diverse inter-Korean talks and North Korea 
policies,'' Kim said. 
  He reassured Yi that he will not seek absorption like in 
Germany, but warned him that the people should guard against 
sentimental theories of unification.

  [Text] New York, Jan 21 KYODO -- Japan supports an 
indefinite, unconditional extension of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) beyond its 1995 expiration since 
it will promote peaceful use of nuclear power, its ambassador in 
charge of disarmament said Friday [21 January]. 
  Yoshitomo Tanaka made the remarks in a speech at the UN 
headquaters at a meeting of the preliminary committee preparing 
for a 1995 international conference to discuss extension of the 
pact. 
  As reasons for Japan's support, Tanaka noted the treaty 
calls 
for nuclear powers to reduce nuclear arms and promotes the 
prevention of nuclear proliferation, a major concern in the 
post-Cold War era. 
  The NPT, which came into force in 1970, requires nuclear 
powers to sincerely promote disarmament talks and bans 
nonnuclear states from producing or possessing nuclear arms. 
  Japan became party to the NPT in 1975. 
  The preliminary committee was set up to promote 
working-level 
consultations before an international conference in 1995. 
  So far, 60 countries have expressed support for unlimited 
extension of the treaty. 
  But nonaligned nations, mostly Asian and African developing 
countries, have demanded that revisions be made in the treaty's 
clauses and that extension be set for a limited period, saying 
the treaty is discriminatory between nuclear powers and 
nonnuclear countries. 
  A majority of support with 162 signatories is needed to 
extend the treaty.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea was on the 
verge of developing a nuclear weapon when it stopped its nuclear 
program because of the mounting outside pressure and 
overwhelming cost, a senior Russian intelligence officer is 
quoted as saying by MOSCOW NEWS [MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI]. 
  ``North Korea was determined in its plan for military 
application of nuclear technology, and according to our 
assessment it was near success,'' Lt. Gen. Gennady Evstafiev, 
director-general of massive destruction weapon control bureau of 
the external intelligence office, says in an interview with the 
weekly in Friday's edition. 
  Pyongyang froze its nuclear development program for two 
reasons, however, because of the international pressure and the 
recognition that it could no longer afford the enormous 
financial burden, Evstafiev says. 
  As a result, he says, the communist regime may give up its 
nuclear program altogether and go entirely public on its nuclear 
sites. 
  The intelligence officer points out that extra care is 
needed 
so as not to upset the sensitive political situation of North 
Korea, which is in the middle of a power transfer. 
  Moscow agrees with international experts on the gravity of 
the North Korean nuclear problem, he says, adding that 
Pyongyang's leaders have long sought to manufacture nuclear, 
biological and chemical weapons and have already succeeded in 
developing a delivery systems by modifying Scud missiles into 
the Nodong-1. 
  Evstafiev names North Korea the most dangerous country in 
the 
world, with the potential to make nuclear weapons. Next on his 
list are Israel, India and Pakistan. 
  He says Pyongyang is playing a big game with Washington in 
their ``nuclear dialogue'' and Moscow has therefore to put its 
national interests first to guarantee safety in the Far East.

  [Text] According to a Chinese source on 21 January, North 
Korea has been secretly extracting a considerable amount of 
plutonium while it held nuclear negotiations with the United 
States, and that it is highly possible that North Korea has 
already produced a small nuclear bomb and is hiding it in an 
underground warehouse. 
  This source well versed in North Korean affairs said: ``I 
recently heard from a senior North Korean official that North 
Korea is hiding nuclear weapons in an underground warehouse in 
the mountains near Pyongyang and that any thorough inspection of 
North Korean nuclear facilities [haek sisol] by the United 
States and the International Atomic Energy Agency will fail to 
locate them.''

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Cha-su: ``Turning the Joint Declaration of </F>
the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula Into an 
International Treaty''] 
  [Text] The Foreign Ministry feels nervous about minimizing 
the stir regarding the report that the United States is calling 
on the ROK to turn the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization 
of the Korean Peninsula into an international treaty. It seems 
the Foreign Ministry is concerned about a breakup of the 
cooperative system with the United States, which may take place 
during the final stage of the U.S.-North Korean negotiations. 
<H5>  The Government's Position </H5>
  The government opposes the U.S. proposal to turn the Joint 
Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula into 
an international treaty. That is, the government contends that 
because the joint declaration of denuclearization signed in 1992 
is not a treaty between countries but an agreement signed within 
the nation, the government does not need to turn it into an 
international treaty. 
  The government believes the issue of North Korea constantly 
keeping nuclear reprocessing facilities, even after adopting the 
joint declaration of denuclearization, should be resolved 
through North-South dialogue. In other words, the government 
believes that the government should persuade North Korea to 
destroy the nuclear reprocessing facilities through the Joint 
Nuclear Control Committee and, then, abide by the joint 
declaration of denuclearization. 
  A government official explained that ``the U.S. proposal to 
turn the Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula into an international treaty is a result of 
considering North Korea's demand for a guarantee that a nuclear 
preemptive strike on the DPRK will not take place.'' That is, 
there is a possibility that because North Korea indeed regards 
as serious a nuclear threat from the United States and others, 
it may stick to nuclear development. Thus, in order to ease 
North Korea's threat, it is necessary for the nuclear-possessing 
countries to promise not to conduct a nuclear attack on North 
Korea. 
  Government officials have analyzed that the United States is 
intending to supplement the weak points of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) by turning the joint declaration 
of denuclearization into an international treaty. The current 
NPT regulations stipulate that NPT member countries can have 
nuclear reprocessing facilities and inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are only required of 
the plutonium produced from the nuclear reprocessing process. 
Accordingly, if the joint declaration of denuclearization is 
turned into an international treaty, North and South Korea 
cannot have nuclear reprocessing facilities so suspicions of 
nuclear development on the Korean peninsula will be fully 
abolished. There was a (Tulatert) protocol signed by South 
American countries, including Brazil and Argentina, in 1967 in 
which the nuclear-possessing countries acknowledged the contents 
that had been agreed upon by the relevant countries. 
  At that time, when the South American countries resolved not 
to develop and possess nuclear weapons, they called on the 
nuclear- possessing countries, including the United States, to 
acknowledge the guarantee of refraining from a nuclear attack on 
them. Thus, the nuclear-possessing countries turned the 
agreement into an international treaty through a protocol. 
  It can be said that the United States has tried to apply 
this 
precedent to the Korean peninsula. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The government has decided to oppose a measure 
promoted by the United States of turning a joint declaration of 
the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula into an 
international treaty in an effort to block North Korea's nuclear 
development. 
  On 17 January an official concerned of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs said that ``a joint declaration of the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is not an act between 
countries [kukka kanui haengwi] and it is, therefore, impossible 
to turn it into an international treaty,'' adding ``the issue of 
nuclear reprocessing facilities on the Korean peninsula should 
be solved between North and South Korea.'' 
  The official continued: ``The government's policy is that if 
the radiochemical laboratory North Korea possesses now turns out 
to be a small-scale nuclear reprocessing facility it will 
persuade North Korea, through the North-South Joint Nuclear 
Control Committee, to close the facility and abide by the joint 
declaration of denuclearization.''

<F P=106> [By Han Chong-ho] </F>
  [Text] Recently the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a 
report entitled, ``Looking Back on the International Situation 
and Its Prospects.'' This report sums up the diplomacy of 1993 
and elucidates diplomatic goals for 1994. This report says that 
the greatest diplomatic tasks for this year are improving 
U.S.-Japan relations and dealing with North Korea's nuclear 
issue. In particular, if North Korea agrees to accept the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's complete inspection at the 
U.S.-North Korea negotiations, Japan and North Korea will resume 
working-level contacts in Beijing which was suspended since the 
eighth Japan-North Korea negotiations in November 1992. 
  The Japan-North Korea talks which started in January 1991 
discussed issues including the issue of compensation for the war 
crimes committed by Japan. These issues were discussed prior to 
discussing the establishment of diplomatic relations. When the 
Japanese side brought up the issue of Yi Un-hye (the Japanese 
instructor to former North Korean terrorist Kim Hyon-hui who was 
responsible for the bombing of the Korean Air Lines plane in 
1983), the North Korean side left the negotiating table and 
talks have been suspended since. Japan proposed resuming talks 
on many occasions, but the North Koreans rejected it each time. 
A Japanese source in Seoul said: ``The Japanese Embassy in 
Beijing frequently telephones the North Korean Embassy in 
Beijing on meeting, but the North Korean side continues to 
reject our proposal.'' 
  A Japanese diplomat who assumed office in Beijing in July 
1993 has not yet exchanged greetings with the North Korean side. 
North Korea only recognizes the United States as a counterpart 
to dialogue and has even left out the ROK. Therefore, the 
Japanese Government is not hastening to resume the Japan-North 
Korea talks and is maintaining a position of observing 
U.S.-North Korea negotiations. 
  However, the Japanese side is becoming active again. On 28 
December 1993, Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata revealed a 
desire to resume negotiations with North Korea by using the 
issue of compensation as a starting point. Also on 9 January, 
on his way home from visiting China he held a news conference 
and openly proposed to the North Korean side that negotiations 
be resumed. Compensation is an issue because North Korea demands 
compensation for Japan's illegal colonialization of Korea which 
Japan insists that the Japanese annexation of Korea was 
legitimate and will only recognize property rights and claims of 
unpaid wages. 
  Japan has been experiencing difficulties in the talks 
because 
of North Korea's nuclear issue. It also revealed that if North 
Korea is willing, talks with North Korea may be resumed at 
anytime. However there are doubts on whether Japan truly wants 
to achieve talks to establish diplomatic relations with North 
Korea. 
  Kim Pong-chin, professor at Japan's North Kyushu University, 
is in agreement with this claim. In a paper written for a 
scientific journal published at the National Unification 
Research Institute, he analyzed: ``The greatest agenda in the 
Japan-North Korea negotiations to establish diplomatic relations 
is the issue of liquidating the past. The reason that North 
Korea is rejecting the talks is that Japan is intentionally 
neglecting internal tasks such as the issue of compensation by 
putting forth external elements such as the nuclear issue.'' 
Professor Kim continued: ``Based on the Cold War era way of 
thinking, Japan is playing the role of proxy for the U.S. policy 
toward North Korea and is trying to advance its own interests to 
the utmost by taking advantage of the weak points and 
limitations of the ROK's North Korea policy.'' 
  Japan's situation on the issue of North Korea's nuclear 
issue 
is summarized as 'accepting reality as it is to establish 
countermeasures.' This theory is that a countermeasure must be 
provided to prevent nuclear development since a war may break 
out if sanctions are carried out toward North Korea. More than 
any other country, Japan is a country that generates the most 
rumors of danger on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, it is 
peculiar for Japan to reach such a leisurely conclusion. What 
Japan is promoting from the level of 'taking measures' for 
nuclear development is the Theater Missile Defense plan. Japan 
claims that this is the interceptor system of North Korea's 
NODONG No. 1 missile, but the ROK experts think that Japan is 
using North Korea's threat to form a nuclear weapons 
transportation system. 
  With North Korea's nuclear problem an issue, Japan is able 
to 
favorably lead the Japan-North Korea negotiations towards 
establishing diplomatic relations and is using the nuclear issue 
to promote arms proliferation. Once the nuclear issue moves 
toward settlement, Japan will once again resort to liquidating 
the past to promote economic relations. Thus, Japan is showing 
flexibility in adapting to reality. This is the true nature of 
Japan's practical diplomacy toward the Korean peninsula. 
  The National Unification Board presented a report entitled 
``Current Situation and Prospect of Economic Relations Between 
Japan and North Korea'' during parliamentary inspections of 
government offices last year. According to this report, Japan's 
post-war policy toward the Korean peninsula was fixed within the 
framework of U.S. policy on Korea. Since the mid-eighties, 
however, Japan has pursued practical diplomacy based on a policy 
of maintaining equal distance towards both South and North Korea 
under the pretext of the slogan, ``Post-war liquidation with 
North Korea.'' This report assesses that Japan's strategy toward 
the Korean peninsula has two parts -- the first aims at 
expanding political influence on the Korean peninsula by 
normalizing relations with North Korea, and the second aims at 
promoting economic infiltration with capital and technology in 
the initiative to reorganize order in Northeast Asia. 
  North Korea and Japan have virtually restored relations 
although they have yet to formally establish diplomatic 
relations. In 1992, a government inspection team presented a 
surprising report after visiting various places in Japan to 
inspect cooperative relations between Japan and North Korea. 
This report reads: ``Japanese businesses have already 
completed the planning and survey stage and have gained an 
understanding of North Korea's industrial situation, examined 
main projects for important areas of North Korea, and studied 
conditions for investment in North Korea. They are believed to 
have established personal relations with leading figures in 
North Korea -- influential figures, provincial party officials, 
and managers of local industrial complexes. It is a matter of 
concern that the North Korean economy may become subject to that 
of Japan once diplomatic relations between the two are 
established.'' 
<H5>  Japan's Foreign Ministry Concerned About Information Leakage </H5>
  Japan's East Asian Trade Institute and the Japan-North 
Korean 
Trade Association visited Pyongyang together on two occasions in 
April 1991 and July 1992 to discuss items that North Korea may 
want to develop and import. Experts are saying that the 
``tripartite trade route'' connecting North Korea and Japan 
through the former Soviet Union and Hong Kong in the fifties and 
the sixties has been revived as the ``tripartite investment 
route.'' 
  Likewise, Japan is disregarding the nuclear issue and 
steadily pushing ahead with work to expand its own interests in 
North Korea. The United States and the ROK will not intervene in 
Japan's affairs as long as Japan cooperates in the resolution of 
the nuclear issue and the improvement of South-North relations. 
In the beginning of the new year, ROK Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said that he would establish various diplomatic 
measures in preparation for the North Korean establishment of 
diplomatic ties with the United States and Japan. Regarding 
this, a ROK diplomat in Seoul said, ``Japan must obtain ROK and 
U.S. consent before establishing diplomatic ties with North 
Korea. North Korea is well aware of this. Minister Han's 
remarks on ROK support in the establishment of diplomatic ties 
between the two means that the ROK is willing to conciliate 
North Korea with the Japan card in the last stage of 
negotiations for resolving the nuclear issue, and not that it 
will actually help in the establishment of North Korea-Japan 
diplomatic relations.'' 
  Reaching a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue 
means 
the beginning of a new diplomatic war. Japan is preparing for a 
new strategy towards the Korean peninsula while ROK leaders 
dream sweet dreams of South-North dialogue, whose resumption 
remains distant. 
  On 28 December 1993, a visit to North Korea by a delegation 
of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDP] led by dietman 
Hajime Hukata, director of the Organizational Department of the 
SDP Central Committee and executive officer of the Japan-DPRK 
Friendship Promotion League at the request of the Workers Party 
of Korea [WPK] generated interest from diplomatic circles. 
Hukata is a typical pro-North Korea politician who had visited 
North Korea on 28 September 1990 with Kanemaru, then-vice 
president of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, to realize 
the joint tripartite declaration. He met Hwang Chang-yop, 
secretary of the WPK and chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, on 30 December. 
Hwang Chang-yop leads the work to establish diplomatic ties 
with Japan as the head of a special agency recently established 
by North Korea on re-establishing diplomatic relations with 
Japan. 
  Hukata's visit to North Korea, however, failed to interest 
ROK and Japanese media because an SDP dietman's visit to North 
Korea is not meaningful under the situation, in which the 
coalition ruling party's future is unclear. An official of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, ``I observed Hukata's visit to 
North Korea with interest, but didn't find anything worth 
noticing.'' 
  Ever since the pro-North Korean SDP became the ruling party, 
the Japanese Foreign Ministry has become deep suspicious of the 
coalition ruling party's policy toward North Korea. An 
influential dietman of the Japan Renewal Party, Hajime Isihi, 
was the executive officer of the team to visit North Korea in 
1990, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Kajimura, who controls key 
departments of the cabinet such as the Intelligence Office, the 
Foreign Policy Deliberation Office, and the Security Office, was 
the deputy executive officer of the delegation to North Korea. 
An unidentified Japanese foreign ministry official told the 
Japanese press that ``It [the Foreign Ministry] cannot help but 
worry about possible information leakage since most of the 
Hosokawa regime's members are pro-North Korea.'' 
  Japan's diplomatic policy is influenced by government 
officials. Regarding this, an observer well-versed in Japanese 
affairs, said to keep an eye on Yutaca Kawashima, minister at 
the Japanese Embassy in the ROK from July 1992 until November 
1993, when he was appointed director of the Foreign Ministry's 
Asia Department, the hub of Japan's foreign policy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Dr. Zlatko Binenfeld, reserve </F>
Croatian Army general and adviser to Croatian Defense Minister, 
by Mate Piskor: ``Tuzla and Vitez Are Ecological Bombs''] 
  [Excerpts] Reporting from the fronts in Croatia and later 
also from those in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croatian media on 
numerous occasions has alleged that the Serbian and the Muslim 
forces have been using chemical agents banned since 1925 by 
international convention. However, there has been very little 
credible evidence and this has been the reason why the Croatian 
Army so far has not openly reported it, stresses Professor Dr. 
Zlatko Binenfeld, reserve general of the Croatian Army and the 
defense minister's adviser for research and military-technical 
development. 
  Piskor: General, your lecture on the application 
of chemical welfare in the clashes in the former Yugoslavia, 
which was given at Croatian Defense Ministry last week, has 
perplexed the public. Why did you present it to the public in 
such a shocking way and why only now? 
  Binenfeld: You see, I am a scientist and I always 
insist that each claim must be supported by the appropriate 
evidence. There had been no material evidence for the use of 
chemical agents in Croatia even though there was much talk about 
it. We have the evidence now and we are presenting it to the 
public. This involves an Oganj rocket filled with the CS 
[chlorobenzamalonitride] chemical agent, which landed near 
Pokupski a year and a half ago and a hand grenade filled with 
the same chemical agent that was recently found near Zadar. 
<H5>  Shocking Information </H5>
  Piskor: You have stated that the former Yugoslav 
National Army has approximately 100 tonnes of CS at its 
disposal. How great a danger does this represent? 
  Binenfeld: Before I give a specific answer, I must 
explain something. I have been studying the problems of 
protection from chemical agents for 42 years. I have lectured 
at the Military Medical Academy and the Military Technical 
Faculty in Zagreb, I was an adviser to the former Yugoslav 
Government on the Disarmament Committee in Geneva, and a 
participant and lecturer at numerous international conventions 
on the use of and protection from chemical agents. Despite 
this, I did not know what the Yugoslav National Army was 
manufacturing in Bijelo Polje near Mostar. I thought that that 
they were manufacturing quantities of chemical agents that were 
only sufficient for protection tests, but in fact they 
manufactured large quantities. General Tus, the commander of 
the air force of the former Yugoslav National Army in Mostar, 
was not informed either, and not even the omniscient CIA had any 
such notion. [passage omitted] 
  Piskor: There is growing evidence that chemical 
agents are being used in the clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
that the Muslim forces are using it increasingly often against 
the Croats. What is your view? 
  Binenfeld: This whole business about the use of 
chemical agents in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I consider the use of 
chlorine to be a chemical agent, started long ago with 
Silajdzic's statement that, if given no other choice, they would 
use chlorine as a weapon. He threatened to poison all Europe 
with chlorine and similar nonsense. Had he used the chlorine in 
Tuzla he would have killed his own people first, because a 
chemical agent kills unselectively, and especially pays no 
attention to ethnicity. 
  But they really do have 500 tonnes of chlorine in Tuzla and 
now comes the most dangerous bit about it. They have threatened 
to use chlorine against the Serbs and the Serbs have accused 
them of actually doing so. However, this is not certain because 
UN experts have found smoke boxes and not bombs filled with 
chlorine. However, they have used chlorine against the Croats 
several times. 
  When we started to receive the initial reports about the use 
of chlorine-filled bombs in Vitez and Busovaca, for a long time 
we would not allow this to be revealed to the public until we 
held what we considered evidence. Evidence means the name of a 
hospital, a date, the name and surname of the patient, date of 
birth, symptoms, a medical examination, therapy, and the seal 
and signature of the physician in charge. Unfortunately, there 
is plenty of such evidence published. We have not received a 
denial of a single one either from the Muslims, whom we were 
accusing, or from the UN Protection Force. [passage omitted] 
  Piskor: Grenades filled with chemical agents are 
being manufactured in Tuzla. However, is Tuzla dangerous just 
because of this? 
  Binenfeld: Precisely. The Sodaso factory in Tuzla 
is a real ecological bomb. I studied the Sodaso factory in 
autumn 1992. Bearing in mind that I obtained information about 
the exact quantities of chemicals that they possess from the 
factory itself, I informed all the important officials in the 
world about the danger. They have all acknowledged it but nobody 
has done a thing about it. I have informed the world that the 
approximately 60 tonnes of mercury in Tuzla presents a danger of 
contamination spreading via the Spreca River practically all the 
way to the Black Sea. The representative of Tuzla in Zagreb has 
openly threatened to do this. Bearing in mind that, apart from 
mercury, they have more than 150 tonnes of a chemical similar to 
the one in Bhopal, where a tenth of the quantity caused a huge 
ecological catastrophe and killed several thousands of people, 
it becomes clear why I have said that Sodaso is a real barrel of 
gunpowder. There is also a great quantity of hydrochloric acid 
and other acids. If an explosion occurred, lethal 
concentrations of acids would emerge. It is actually difficult 
to anticipate what would happen, how many people would perish, 
how many would be injured, and what the environment would be 
like afterward. It would be a catastrophe. I have proposed that 
these chemicals be transported somewhere safe, but, naturally, 
again without any success. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Jan (NA) -- Argentine Vice Foreign 
Minister [title as received] Fernando Petrella stated that the 
ratification of the Tlatelolco Treaty by Argentina, Brazil, and 
Chile ``will bring tranquillity not only to these countries but 
to the rest of the hemisphere, and to the international 
community as well.'' 
  Petrella stressed the system ``of verification and 
transparency'' signed by the three countries, and added that the 
opposite would have been ``submitting Argentina to a system of 
separation and isolation that would have led it to lose the 
train of development in the nuclear area.'' 
  In remarks to a radio station, Petrella said the document 
ratifying the Tlatelolco Treaty by Argentina was submitted today 
in Mexico City by Foreign Policy Under Secretary Rogelio Pfirter. 
  However, so far Brazil has not ratified the treaty, although 
it had agreed with Argentina and Chile to simultaneously submit 
the documents. 
  ``What happened was a little lack of synchronization, but 
Brazil will ratify the treaty, possibly in the course of the 
first quarter of this year,'' Petrella said. 
  The vice foreign minister denied that the Tlatelolco 
Treaty's 
ratification would reduce Argentine sovereignty in nuclear 
matters ``because it is just a matter of preserving the 
country's current capacity, attained very well in the past.'' 
  ``In this manner some situations will be whitewashed and we 
will be in a position to have access to technology that the 
National Atomic Energy Commission and the entire Argentine 
nuclear industry need,'' he said. 
  Petrella said: ``Ukraine, which is a nuclear power, wants to 
stop being one, the same as the Czech Republic, and North Korea, 
a country with which the international community is 
negotiating.'' 
  ``I would say that most countries will be members not only 
of 
the common agreements but of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
as well, which Argentina hopes to join this year, as conveyed by 
the president,'' he said. 
  Petrella also stressed the ``distrust'' that existed among 
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile concerning the nuclear issue, 
``partly created by the origin of the Treaty for the Provision 
of Nuclear Weapons that has marked a sort of discrimination 
between those that could be nuclear powers and those that could 
not.'' 
  ``Those countries that conducted a nuclear explosion before 
1967 could become members, while all other nations, some of 
which had tremendous industrial development, were left out,'' he 
said. 
  In that order he said: ``That sort of discrimination has 
generated a distrust in countries that, in this manner, could 
not have access to technology that would allow them to use 
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.'' 
  ``This has demonstrated that the treaty was baseless because 
countries such as ours have broadly developed that technology 
without violating, by self-control, what the treaty 
prohibited,'' he said.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- Nuclear Industries of Brazil (INB) 
last Friday delivered to Furnas Centrais Eletricas the first 
eight fuel rods for the next fuel loading of the Angra-1 nuclear 
plant. By 6 February INB expects all 40 new fuel rods will be in 
the plant. 
  Angra-1 will be undergoing its fourth fuel replacement 
process, an operation that is usually made every 18 months. The 
plant, which discontinued operations in 1993, will be started in 
the middle of February according to the latest decision by the 
directorate of Furnas, which operates the nuclear plant. 
  Fuel rods are assembled at INB's Fuel Elements Factory (FEC) 
in Resende (Rio de Janeiro). Transportation between this city 
and Angra doe Reis (Rio de Janeiro) takes approximately six 
hours. During this first stage two fuel rods are being 
transported in each container, in four trucks.

  [Text] The government is waiting for Congress to approve a 
bill to establish controls on the export and import of 
dual-purpose military goods (for civilian and military purposes 
and directly linked services) prior to negotiating our entry 
into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), an 
organization created by a group of countries in 1987 to control 
the export of technologies and systems that can contribute to 
the proliferation of missiles capable of carrying nuclear 
warheads. 
  Draft bill 2530/92, which is included in the executive 
branch 
message 36/92, has already been approved by the Chamber of 
Deputies Economy Committee and has a preliminary favorable 
opinion of coordinator Fabio Feldmann, of the Consumer Defense, 
Environment, and Minorities Committee. His advisers state that 
the report will be finished by the end of the month and will be 
included the amendments proposed by the Navy Ministry last week. 
The draft was also sent to the National Defense, Science and 
Technology, and Constitution and Justice Committees. 
  Having been approved two by committees -- because the 
Foreign 
Ministry already has the approval of the Environment Committee 
-- the government will now ask for very urgent discussion of the 
bill using a procedure that sends the bill directly to the 
plenum without passing through other committees. 
  Diplomatic sources have stated that the government wants to 
increase Brazilian credibility before the international 
community. To become a member of the MTCR, Congress must first 
approve the bill controlling the export of dual-purpose 
materiel. Congress must also ratify the quadripartite nuclear 
safeguards agreement among Brazil, Argentina, the 
Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control (ABACC), 
and the amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty that ban nuclear 
weapons in Latin America. The Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee postponed voting on both items last week. 
  A diplomatic source commented: ``Brazil's participation in 
the MTCR comes under the nonproliferation policy.'' By 
approving the bill, Brazil will be prohibited from passing 
technologies received from industrialized countries to countries 
considered untrustworthy, such as Iraq, North Korea, and Libya. 
  The bill sent to the Chamber of Deputies in August 1992 
provides for the creation of an international importation 
certificate by which importers commit themselves to refrain from 
exporting certain goods without previous authorization of the 
appropriate Brazilian authorities. The bill also creates a 
delivery verification certificate to confirm the entry of the 
product into the importing country. The bill anticipates -- 
under the jurisdiction of the president of the Republic -- the 
creation of a permanent inter- ministerial commission comprising 
representatives of various ministries. 
  The position of executive secretary will be filled by the 
Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE). 
  In his preliminary report, Fabio Feldmann (PSDB-SP) 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party - Sao Paulo] says: ``Military 
materiels, such as ammunition and explosives in any of their 
diverse forms, require strict controls on their handling, 
transport, and storage.''

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Jan (MENA)--Engineer Mahir Abazah, 
minister of electricity and energy, has denied the presence of 
any pressure on Egypt not to implement the project of nuclear 
stations for generating electrical power. 
  The minister said before today's meeting of the People's 
Assembly Committee for Energy and Industry, chaired by Dr. Amin 
Mubarak, that the ministry is following up on the latest 
developments in nuclear stations around the world so that they 
will be ready at the appropriate time whenever a decision is 
reached to implement the nuclear stations. 
  Mahir Abazah added that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor 
explosion restricted the expansion of many developed countries 
in the field of nuclear stations. Examples are the United 
States, Italy, and Germany. 
  The members of the committee had demanded that modern 
technology specializing in the use of nuclear reactors for 
generating electricity be introduced to deal with the rise in 
the price of electricity in Egypt. They noted that there are 
those who maintain that there are pressures on Egypt not to set 
up such stations.

  [Text] Bangalore -- India will continue to develop its 
nuclear energy programme, especially in the field of fast 
breeder reactors in the overall interest of development and 
improving the quality of life of the citizenry Atomic Energy 
Commission Chairman R. Chidambaram asserted here on Monday. 
  Inaugurating a four-week residential course on ``An 
integrated approach to knowledge, and information'' at the 
National Institute of Advanced Studies. Chidambaram pointed out 
that there were many dimensions to nuclear energy, the 
generation of electricity being only one facet of the country's 
nuclear programme. 
  Over the years the spin-off from nuclear research had 
enriched industry, helped medical sciences and boosted 
agriculture. BARC [Bhaba Atomic Research Center] for example had 
played a vital role in the agriculture sector by creating new 
pulse varieties. In Maharashtra farmers who cultivated 
BARC-developed pulse varieties 31,000 hectares in 1989 had been 
so impressed with the yield that they increased their sowing 
area to 2,00,000 hectares by 1993. 
  He said nuclear energy would be increasingly used in the 
country in the 21st century as conservationists were up in arms 
against mega hydel projects and the heavily polluting thermal 
projects. 
  Chidambaram pointed out that efforts were on to make use of 
India's vast reserves of thorium which were five times more that 
the uranium reserves. ``Our pressurised heavy water reactors use 
uranium, hence work is on to make greater use of thorium. At 
Kakrappa, in Gujara we have made a beginning. But much more 
needs to be done,'' he said. 
  Chidambaram said that India's safety record in the running 
of 
its nuclear power plants had been very good. ``The truth is that 
the dangers of radiation are more pronounced at radiology 
departments and at X-ray units where proper precautions are not 
taken. The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board was studying ways and 
means to reduce the danger posed to patients,'' he said. 
  Later, participating in the Foundation Day celebration of 
the 
Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) he called upon the 
scientists to make use of the synergistic strengths of various 
research organisations across the country to contribute to the 
growth and development of the nation.

  [Text] The products of the Arak petrochemical 
complex--which has an annual production capacity of 350,000 
tons--have eliminated the needs of most of the country's 
industrial units for raw materials. 
  The deputy minister for petrochemical affairs in the 
Petroleum Ministry, who is also the director general of the 
National Petrochemical Company [NPC], announced yesterday: The 
units of the Arak Petrochemical Complex have begun full 
production. In an exclusive interview with the Voice and Vision 
of the Islamic Republic of Iran, he provided more details: 
  [Begin recording] Unidentified 
correspondent: Can you give us details regarding the latest 
petrochemical units that have recently become operational at the 
Arak Petrochemical Complex? 
  Deputy minister: I can give the glad tidings to 
our dear compatriots that the Islamic country of Iran is now the 
primary producer of raw materials for the plastics industry in 
Arak. We now produce various plastic substances while formerly 
this industry was dependent on foreign imports. Fortunately, 
today we produce 350,000 tons of such materials in Arak, which 
fulfills most of the needs of our 1,500-2,000 indigenous 
factories engaged in the plastics industry. 
  In the near future we will eliminate all the remaining 
shortages with the production at the Bandar-e Imam Petrochemical 
Complex. These products entered the market about two months ago. 
Today, fortunately, the first phase of the Arak Petrochemical 
Complex, which includes six industrial units, has become 
completely operational and will cater to the needs of numerous 
domestic factories. It may be worth mentioning here that 
plastic materials are byproducts of petrochemicals, which have 
extensive value-added uses and consumption in the areas of 
foodstuffs, clothing, housing, hygiene, and health. You will 
see the large variety of such products in these fields as they 
replace natural materials such as minerals, iron ore, other 
metals, and cotton. 
  I personally wish to stress that since we have been 
successful in producing these goods from crude oil, the entire 
country should endeavor to boost its use of these products in 
the country and to reduce their use of natural products, 
especially since synthetics are cheaper to use and produce. We 
intend to replace natural products with plastics. 
  The production of petrochemicals in Arak marks a quantum 
leap 
and a change of the climate in the petrochemicals industry in 
Iran, praise be to God. In the near future we will be quite 
(?self-sufficient) in this area. 
  Correspondent: Thank you. 
  Deputy minister: You are welcome. [end

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said 
Pakistan firmly believes in going ahead with making a fuller 
peaceful use of atomic technology. She was presiding over the 
annual meeting of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Council in 
Islamabad today. The council reviewed the progress of work at 
different establishments of the Pakistan Atomic Energy 
Commission and considered the main lines of future programs of 
the commission which lay emphasis on self-reliance and 
indigenization. 
  Addressing the council, the prime minister said the Islamic, 
democratic and awami [people's] government fully supports 
achieving excellence and advancement of technology, be it simple 
or high technology. It was the elected prime minister, late 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who had first started the atomic projects 
in Pakistan which are now being implemented. Late Zulfiqar Ali 
Bhutto had 25 years ago given an autonomous status to Pakistan 
Atomic Energy Commission and sought cooperation of the United 
States for support of PINSTECH [Pakistan Institute of Nuclear 
Science and Technology] and other atomic projects. Now, the 
prime minister said, with Chinese cooperation her government is 
completing the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant after 25 years. 
There are some undue misgivings about our peaceful nuclear 
program, but we hope that Pakistan would very soon be able to 
allay these misgivings. 
  The prime minister expressed the determination to make 
Pakistan an enviable, progressive and developed state. She paid 
tributes to the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission scientists for 
working selflessly and single-mindedly without looking for award 
or name. The present government, after its takeover, especially 
marked one of its cabinet meetings for preparation and approval 
of the new technology policy. Despite financial constraints, 
the government earmarked an amount of 1 billion rupees for this 
purpose. She expressed the confidence that the new policy would 
lead the country toward rapid economic development. The present 
government is attaching high priority to the energy sector. 
Work at the 300-megawatt nuclear power plant acquired during 
1988-90 would be completed soon. The prime minister 
complimented the commission on its performance and directed it 
to work with greater vigor for peaceful application of nuclear 
technology for socioeconomic uplift in the country. 
  Earlier, the prime minister was shown the indigenously 
redesigned and upgraded Pakistan Research Reactor-1 and the 
research facilities around it. The chairman of the Pakistan 
Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed, briefed the prime 
minister about the activities in pursuit of peaceful application 
of atomic energy.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Pakistan will be able to manufacture 
its own nuclear power reactors sooner than later. 
  This was disclosed by the chairman Pakistan Atomic Energy 
Commission (PAEC), Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad, while speaking at a 
discussion on Pakistan Television Monday evening. 
  Former chairman of the commission, Munir Ahmed Khan, was the 
other participant, while Farhatullah Babar, press secretary to 
prime minister, was the moderator. 
  ``In fact, a successful experiment in this regard had 
already 
been made,'' informed Dr. Ishfaq. 
  He reiterated the government's resolve to continue its 
peaceful nuclear programme. 
  ``It is an issue on which there is complete national 
consensus,'' Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed said. He was of the view that in 
the wake of scarce energy resources, it was an imperative for 
Pakistan to concentrate on its peaceful nuclear programme. 
  ``Pakistan's nuclear programme was totally peaceful and its 
sole objective was the social uplift of the people,'' remarked 
Dr. Ishfaq. 
  Pakistan, fortunately, had a number of highly professional 
and qualified scientists, who were busy undertaking research 
work in a variety of fields relating to nuclear science, said 
the chairman PAEC. 
  ``Research and development (R&amp;D) programme, which is 
working 
for past 25 years, had been further strengthened, and Pinstech 
was leading the programme,'' told Dr. Ishfaq. 
  He also informed that at the Kanupp, scientists have 
prepared 
spare-parts and a full-fledged computer programme, which speaks 
volumes of their capability in the field. 
  Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed told the viewers that the 300-megawatt 
Chashma nuclear power plant, being setup with the assistance of 
China, will be operative within the next two years. 
  The usage of nuclear technology in agriculture, industry, 
and 
health sectors was also dilated upon by Dr Ishfaq who told that, 
so far, 180,000 patients had benefited from the techniques 
introduced at centres where nuclear technology was being used. 
  Munir Ahmed Khan, former chairman of the PAEC, said in the 
wake of atomic blast by India in 1974, Pakistan intensified his 
efforts to expand its nuclear capability. Initially, he 
recalled, the emphasis was on increasing our scientific 
manpower, which stood at 300 then, and to provide them the 
latest scientific education. 
  ``Unfortunately, all the advanced countries stopped 
fufilling 
their commitments to Pakistan in the aftermath of atomic blast 
by India,'' observed Munir Ahmed Khan. 
  In this context, he referred to the Pak-French agreement for 
reprocessing plant and stoppage of spare-parts for Kanupp by 
Canada. 
  Consequently, he said, centres of nuclear studies were set 
up. 
  ``That was the period when the Pakistan scientists were 
compelled to depend on self-reliance which has paid dividends 
over the years,'' reflected the former chairman PAEC. He termed 
the commission as one of the best institutions and a centre of 
excellence in the muslim world. 
  Farhatullah Babar said that the government of Benazir Bhutto 
was determined to pursue peaceful nuclear programme to meet the 
energy shortage that the country was facing. 
  He referred to the recent visit to PAEC by the prime 
minister. In her address to the council's annual meeting, told 
the moderator, the prime minister had categorically stated that 
her Islamic, awami and democratic government was determined to 
fulfil the dream of late Z. A. Bhutto who, with the cooperation 
of the United States, had laid the foundation of Pinstech and 
other scientic organizations.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Sizov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow Jan 14 TASS -- The documents on the complete 
destruction of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal by its transfer to and 
scrapping in Russia, which were signed in the Kremlin, also 
determine the procedure of the payment of compensation to Kiev 
for their loss, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in 
an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
  This loss, according to Kozyrev, will be made up with 
uranium 
fuel, which Russia will obtain after recycling the weapon-grade 
uranium in collaboration with the United States. Part of the 
profit gained from the sale of uranium on the world market 
belongs to Ukraine, Kozyrev noted. The uranium after all is the 
property of the former Soviet Union, which is why the profit 
from its sale will be divided, he said. ``We ourselves will 
obtain weapon-grade uranium, recycle it and sell to America, and 
the share belonging to Ukraine will be paid in the form of 
uranium fuel,'' he clarified. 
  According to the Russian foreign minister, there is no 
provision for any additional payments by Russia, and also of 
writing off a part of Ukraine's debts. 
  Andrey Kozyrev said that the United States will provide 
additional resources so that Moscow and Kiev can both ensure 
safety during the dismantling of the nuclear arsenal, its 
transportation and other necessary procedures. Naturally, the 
dismantling of the arsenal -- the nuclear contents and the 
warhead -- will be carried out in Russia only. Not because, 
Kozyrev emphasised, Moscow wants to humiliate or offend Ukraine, 
but because the appropriate plants are located in Russia and a 
warhead can only be dismantled where it was made, otherwise 
there would be a real danger of monstrous environmental 
consequences. 
  The signed agreements really are historical. A political 
decision has been made and the political will has been 
displayed, now only ``purely technical work'' is needed to go 
ahead, Kozyrev said. First of all we should determine the share 
belonging to Ukraine, deduct from it Russia's expenses on 
recycling it and other works and repay this part ``in whatever 
form the Ukrainians want and the Russians can manage,'' he said. 
But it is a purely technical question, the Russian minister 
said. 
  Speaking of security guarantees given to Ukraine, Andrey 
Kozyrev emphasised that they are basically standard ones. These 
are the same guarantees which the three countries, the United 
States, England and Russia, give to all the participants in the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons treaty. It is quite natural 
that the signed documents will come into force only after 
Ukraine joins the nuclear weapon nonproliferation treaty as a 
nonnuclear state, the Russian minister said.

<F P=106> [VoyenTV ``Bearing South'' video report; from the ``Military </F>
Review'' program] 
  [Text] Now a few words about one of the most important 
military-political events of the week. Russia and Ukraine, not 
without some help from the U.S. President, have finally managed 
to agree on the future of Ukraine's nuclear potential. 
  At the meeting of three presidents -- the Presidents of 
Russia, the United States, and Ukraine -- Leonid Kravchuk 
confirmed Ukraine would join the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
as soon as possible as a state without nuclear weapons. 
[video carries montage of shots showing troops handling 
weapons components; the ``Voyen TV,'' Ministry of Defense 
Television Studio logo is shown at top right of screen] It 
is presumed the first 200 nuclear weapons will be withdrawn from 
Ukraine to Russia within 10 months. Altogether about 2,000 
nuclear weapons must be dismantled in Ukraine. [video cuts

of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, addressing a news 
conference] 
  [Begin Maslin recording] In their statement the 
Presidents emphasized the importance of ensuring the security 
and reliability of nuclear weapons until they are dismantled. 
At the same time, the state of affairs regarding nuclear safety 
on the territory of Ukraine continues to worsen. Storage depots 
are packed beyond standard limits with warheads and nuclear 
munitions that have been removed from service. 
  This is intolerable and besides everything else, it has 
brought about a considerable increase in radiation levels. This 
has been confirmed by chief designers from Arzamas-16 who 
visited Pervomaysk on Ukrainian territory in September last 
year. The warranty periods of most component parts have 
expired. [end recording; video shows destruction of a 
launch tube] 
  The signed agreement promises that nuclear weapons, which 
are 
dangerous not only when used but also when improperly stored, 
will stop being used as bargaining chips in political games.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 14 January carries the regularly 
scheduled ``Details'' program. The program, hosted by Nikolay 
Svanidze, contains excerpts of interviews with Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, and Ukrainian Ambassador to Russia Vladimir 
Kryzhanovskiy, by unidentified correspondents. Places and dates 
of the interviews are not given. 
  The program opens with an excerpt from Kravchuk who says 
that 
14 January is New Year's Day according to the ``old calendar.'' 
Therefore, he wishes the people of Russia and everybody a Happy 
New Year. Kravchuk says, ``And on the whole, this month, is, 
let's say, a new beginning because today is the beginning of a 
new account. Because today's document is the beginning of a new 
page for Ukraine, for Russia and for the whole world.'' 
  Svanidze then says that in Moscow today the presidents of 
Russia, the United States, and Ukraine discussed nuclear weapons 
and Ukraine agreed to withdraw to Russia 176 intercontinental 
missiles and approximately 1,500 warheads for dismantling. 
  Next follows an excerpt of Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy's 
interview. He says: ``Ukraine is not backing down. I would call 
it a trilateral compromise. All three sides made some 
compromises. I would not say that the biggest compromise was 
made by Ukraine.'' 
  In a further excerpt of the Kravchuk interview, Kravchuk 
says: ``To embark upon the path of confrontation or ambition is 
a bad thing. Most in Ukraine understand this, I know. 
Unfortunately, there are people who see things differently. 
Fortunately, such people are in the minority.'' 
  Then Kryzhanovskiy says in his interview, ``The president, 
in 
this case, is carrying out, in full and in principle, the will 
of the people. Moreover, there are even certain, I would say, 
contradictions between him and the parliament, which wants these 
weapons to remain on the territory of Ukraine for a certain 
time, until certain conditions prevail.'' 
  Svanidze says that Kravchuk is in a difficult situation. He 
has been performing a balancing act for the past two years -- 
balancing the temptation to be leader of a nuclear state and the 
impossibility of keeping these ``expensive toys.'' 
  Kryzhanovskiy is then shown saying, ``We are not thinking of 
servicing of these nuclear weapons. We were counting on them 
being serviced by Russian specialists alone.'' 
  Next is an excerpt from Kravchuk, who says, ``The nuclear 
weapons which we inherited from the former Soviet Union could 
not be used by Ukraine, speaking frankly, as a guarantor of 
security or as weapons of deterrence, because they were 
manufactured in Russia, the codes -- in Russia, the buttons -- 
in Russia. Therefore, that is all an illusion.'' 
  An excerpt from the Kozyrev interview follows. He says, 
``Against whom were the nuclear missiles in Ukraine, which were 
installed by the former Soviet Union, directed? Against the USA 
and NATO, and they are aimed at the USA and NATO. They are not 
aimed at Russia. And the missiles which are in America? They 
used to be aimed at the Soviet Union -- and now in Moscow... 
[pauses] and incidentally, that bilateral, Russian-American 
agreement is much more important for us. Why? Because American 
weapons used to and are still to this day aimed at Moscow. 
Nuclear weapons, each of which is capable of wiping out in a 
second what we have here.'' 
  ``Well, the agreement reached on not targeting them, the 
flight assignment is to be canceled, and that process will be 
finished in about two month's time. That is what the Presidents 
of Russia and the United States agreed in Moscow. That is to 
say, you and I are no longer rabbits. At least, in two month's 
time we will not be in a situation where any madman may at any 
moment press that infamous button by accident and a missile will 
fly according to an assignment set years ago - namely towards 
us. It will fly, but most likely, into space. Do you 
understand [word indistinct]. That is a substantial thing. The 
Ukrainian missiles -- that is, those in Ukraine, are not aimed 
at us. Therefore, it may be important for the Americans -- the 
missiles are aimed at them.'' 
  Svanidze, shown sitting on a sofa beside Kozyrev, asks if 
the 
missiles can be pointed a new target. Kozyrev replies: ``But it 
is not that easy to retarget them, and Moscow is the one who has 
to retarget them because that infamous button for these missiles 
is in Moscow. But naturally, we will not do that. We will not 
point these missiles at ourselves.'' 
  Svanidze says that pressure has been brought to bear on 
Kravchuk from domestic and foreign forces. He was beset by 
crisis in 1993 and anti-Russian feeling is running high in 
Ukraine, but compensation is promised Ukraine for giving up its 
nuclear weapons. 
  Kravchuk is shown saying, ``Taking account of the fact that 
there will be compensation for the tactical and strategic 
nuclear weapons, that there will guarantees of national 
security, financial, economic, technical and guaranteed aid. 
All of that is in Ukraine's interest.'' 
  Svanidze then says that Ukraine has not managed to step out 
of Russia's shadow and embark upon independent dialogue with the 
West, but Kravchuk did what he had to do as president of a 
country beset by economic problems such as Ukraine's. 
  Kravchuk is again shown. He says, ``It is not that one will 
be the older and the other the younger, that one is the older 
brother and one the younger brother, that one is the leader and 
the other is subordinate. The peoples will be equal. Equal in 
all their relations, one a bit more, one a bit less.'' 
  A further fragment of Kozyrev's interview follows: ``The 
episode with Ukraine is the clearing away of Russia's old 
obstructions. Do you see? Essentially, the meeting on the 
Ukrainian theme, unfortunately, took place two years later than 
it should have done and this is the reason for the delay in the 
process of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine.''

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Vinogradov: ``Almaty Demands Billion </F>
Dollars for Its Uranium''] 
  [Text] Kazakhstan intends to be get the full amount 
[poluchit spolna] for the uranium contained in the warheads of 
the 104 SS-18 missiles located on its territory. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev said this in Kiev, where he is on an 
official visit. The Kazakh president pointed out that he is 
ready to sign a new agreement with Russia either on a bilateral 
basis or on a quadrilateral basis involving Ukraine and Belarus. 
In the next few days he will be going to Washington to discuss 
these problems with Bill Clinton. 
  Russia believed that the matter of compensation for the 
nuclear material in the strategic missiles due for removal from 
Kazakhstan was in principle closed. There are agreements on 
this point. Almaty, like Kiev and Minsk, should receive its 
share after deduction of expenditure on the reprocessing of 
highly enriched uranium and its transportation and storage at 
Russian plants. 
  However, all the indications are that the method of 
calculation adopted earlier does not suit the Kazakh side. It 
intends to follow the example of Ukraine, which succeeded a week 
ago in obtaining $1 billion on signing the trilateral agreement 
with Russia and the United States in Moscow. This money is 
being given to Ukraine out of the sum appropriated by the U.S. 
Congress for the nuclear disarmament of the CIS countries under 
the START I treaty. It has become known that Almaty is hoping 
for similar compensation. 
  In other words, Kazakhstan, like Ukraine, has decided not to 
wait for funds to come into its account from the sale of uranium 
by its Russian partners, whom it is not inclined to trust very 
much. It is obviously safer to get insurance now, in the form of 
a guaranteed billion out of the U.S. quota. 
  Experts believe that in that event Russia will have to take 
on additional expenditure for the safe dismantling of nuclear 
warheads in the possession of its CIS neighbors. It cannot be 
rule out that Belarus will demand its share in the same way, 
although some of the uranium has already been shipped out of its 
territory to Russia for reprocessing. When it hosted Bill 
Clinton recently, Minsk received $100 million from this same 
package. But now, REUTER reports, Belarus is laying claim to a 
further $500 million.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Oysboyt, chairman of the Kaliningrad Oblast </F>
branch of the Chernobyl Union: ``Submarine That Cannot Sail...'' 
-- first paragraph is KALININGRADSKAYA PRAVDA introduction] 
  [Text] Discussion around the possibility and expediency of 
building an underground nuclear power plant in our oblast -- 
judging by the number of letters from our readers -- still draws 
attention. We have published articles by Mr. Dolgov, a 
representative of the joint stock company Malakhit, and Mr. 
Leonov, commander of the APLK-27 submarine boat, who have called 
on citizens of our region to mature to the understanding that 
building a nuclear power plant in our oblast is necessary. In 
response to these appeals, ordinary citizens of Kaliningrad 
Oblast have sent us letters objecting to this idea. M. Oysboyt, 
chairman of the Kaliningrad Oblast branch of the Chernobyl 
Union, has also joined the discussion. His position and 
justified criticisms have made us rethink other aspects of this 
issue. 
  The idea of constructing a nuclear power plant in our oblast 
was first suggested by Dolgov, a representative of the joint 
stock company Malakhit, which was once working on designs for 
nuclear reactor steam-generating machines for the defense 
industry. The approaching conversion has made the designers 
seek a nice wrapping for the introduction of their products on 
``peaceful'' markets. In other words, the ``atomic lobby'' has 
tried to pour new blood into an old industry which was damaged 
along with the Chernobyl reactor. In other countries, the 
lobby's synonym is the ``nuclear Mafia.'' I dare say that it is 
the most dangerous one. There have been many cases when 
top-level officials from different oblast administrations, or 
even the government, who were previously sharply opposed to this 
lobby, have suddenly changed their opinions completely. It is 
quite obvious with what this has been connected. 
  The apparently absolute nuclear security and safe operation 
of the proposed type of reactors with liquid metal heaters serve 
as arguments for building an underground nuclear power plant in 
Kaliningrad Oblast, and the underground location of the plant is 
portrayed as additional security. At least three aspects here 
are alarming. The first two have already been presented -- the 
failure of a similar reactor on the APLK-27, the causes of which 
are still unknown, and the well-known vacuum reactivity effect, 
another inherent fault of this type of reactor. 
  There is also a more recent example: Russian VESTI has 
reported that a leak of radioactive sodium occurred during a 
recent accident at the Beloyarskaya nuclear power plant. 
Apparently, the accident involved the recommended type of 
reactor with a liquid metal heater. Sodium is used in no other 
type of reactor. The secure operation of underground nuclear 
power plants also raises doubts. Such a plant will rather 
resemble a nuclear submarine that cannot come to the surface. 
Every component of this system may provoke an emergency 
situation. The number of emergency situations at currently 
operating nuclear power plants and submarines is listed in the 
three-digit range. I will cite a sample from a report by the 
Government Commission for Investigating Causes of the Chernobyl 
Nuclear Power Plant Breakdown. 
  ``There has been no single year without an emergency 
situation at the nuclear power plant... There have been 1,042 
emergency stoppages of power units over the last five years; 
among them, only 35 percent have occurred due to human error.'' 
  This means that the remaining 65 percent were caused by 
technical malfunctions and led to serious consequences. The 
most frequent emergency situation on nuclear submarines is fire. 
An analysis of the causes of fires on Soviet and U.S. Navy 
nuclear submarines shows that 70 percent of such accidents have 
been caused by short circuits in electric switchboards and 
wires, which are connected with technical defects. There are 
twice as many electric wires in a nuclear power plant as on a 
submarine. Whereas a nuclear submarine can surface and call for 
help from other naval vessel, an underground nuclear power plant 
will not sail, and therefore, politely speaking, it is very hard 
to extinguish a fire in one. 
  There is an array of intermediate scenarios between these 
two 
extremes, but it is obvious that a number of problems will have 
to be solved over the coming decades or even centuries, 
depending on the half-lives or degeneration of nuclear 
components. There are also two intriguing economic aspects of 
building a nuclear power plant. The first one is that the 
Malakhit joint stock company will charge only for designing a 
nuclear power plant, which will take three or five years. Who 
will built it, provide necessary supplies, and complete the 
work? All Malakhit needs right now is money, and later it will 
somehow be built. The second aspect is that those who have 
suffered from nuclear arms research have been asking who is 
responsible for that after these many years. Who is to pay 
compensation for possible accidents? 
  My position is clear: We do not need such problems. 
However, neither the current administration nor future 
parliament will have the right to resolve this problem. I am 
deeply convinced that only the entire population of our oblast, 
having complete information about the risks facing them as well 
as possible profits and losses, can decide whether they want to 
live in such a neighborhood. This can be done only by way of a 
region-wide referendum.

<F P=106> [``Article Received Through RIA-Novosti Exclusively for </F>
ADEVARUL'' by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: ``Russia 
and NATO''] 
  [Text] The tendency to establish a democratic Europe as a 
whole is being thwarted by the tendency to break it up and the 
appearance of new threats and dangers. Which of these 
tendencies is going to prevail? This greatly depends on the 
decisions that will be adopted in Brussels and by the CSCE in 
Budapest. 
  Toward what goals should the general security system that is 
going to be established be directed? What criteria are to be 
used to establish this system? What possible ways are there for 
this system to come about? 
  One cannot say that there is a crisis of solutions -- 
apparently with ``only one way'' that is effective -- to 
European security issues. These solutions are based on two 
myths that are believed by their supporters as being axioms of 
current European policy. First, we talk about the thesis that 
there is a ``security vacuum'' and a ``gray zone'' in Central 
Europe, which is condemned inevitably to become Russia's sphere 
of expansion. And second, we talk about the thesis of 
``Russia's move toward a nationalistic, imperialist policy'' 
after the recent parliamentary elections. 
  By putting the two affirmations together, one can conclude 
that NATO must defend Central European countries from the 
imminent pressure coming from the East. 
  To accept the thesis of the ``security vacuum'' would mean 
to 
reject precisely the essence of the general European process, 
the way in which it is described in the Paris Charter, namely 
the unity of democratic peoples in Europe. This would be the 
greatest failure of the orientation of the entire European 
policy, which, apparently, in spite of unavoidable difficulties, 
brought about the unification of Germany and ensured the 
destruction of the totalitarian monsters of the 20th century. 
  And if we consider the worst-case scenario -- the revival of 
Russian imperialism -- then we should start, not from the 
hypothesis of ``Soviet tanks'' pouring into the West, but from a 
replay of the Yugoslav drama in the former USSR. The result 
would be tens of millions of refugees, catastrophe in great 
industrial complexes, and the danger posed by the use of 
tactical nuclear weapons. What will NATO be able to do in such 
a situation to defend its Eastern members? Two Chernobyls would 
be more than enough for all of Europe. The ``guard on the 
[River] Bug'' would not be able to save anybody. 
  Among other things, this scenario -- the worst possible -- 
might be provoked precisely by a hasty expansion of NATO. It 
would serve the extremists in Russia as the most convincing 
argument in favor of a revival of the Russian empire to reject 
the ``pressure of the West.'' Thus, the strategy of ``the most 
evil scenario'' is dangerous because it carries in itself a 
forecast that can very easily become reality. 
  The fear of a new ``Russian threat'' can be eliminated first 
of all through a partnership with democratic Russia, which has 
embarked on a path of establishing a rule-of-law state and a 
market economy. The foreign policy promoted by Russia's 
president has already proved its orientation toward achieving 
the national interest of the country through partnership and not 
through confrontation with the surrounding world. This foreign 
policy is sanctioned in a democratic Constitution. Russia does 
not have territorial claims on any country in the word, and thus 
no claims on Central or Eastern European countries either. 
Russia's new military doctrine directs its armed forces 
exclusively toward defending the country and its allies and 
toward peace operations in accordance with Russia's 
international engagements. 
  As far as the results of the parliamentary elections are 
concerned, I am convinced that there can be no fertile ground 
for any real fascist outbursts in Russia, a country that in 
World War II took more sacrifices than any other country in the 
world to the shrine of the victory over fascism. The electorate 
cast their votes not for a ``campaign against the West'' or ``to 
set out for the South Seas'' and not for the forced restoration 
of the Soviet Union or of the socialist camp. They voted 
against the ambitions and arrogance of certain reformers, 
against their lack of ability to explain to the people the goal 
of reform in simple, human language, and against the current 
lack of social protection for the population and the inadequacy 
of the fight against crime. The Russian democrats have already 
started to draw the necessary conclusions from the awakening 
lessons administered to them by the parliamentary elections. But 
there is not and will never be any ``flirtation'' with 
right-wing extremism. We condemn all overt or covert forms of 
extremism, aggressive nationalism, and fascism. 
  The West in turn must also draw conclusions and correct the 
tone and the manner of its dialogue with Russia. Advice and 
recommendations have no room in this dialogue. The partner 
starts off on the wrong foot by presenting certain proposals 
that we must either adopt entirely or reject entirely, without 
the right to make certain adjustments to it, in accordance with 
our own interests. 
  Now is the time when Russia should feel more strongly 
foreign 
support for its reform process. An accurately worked out, 
detailed strategy of cooperation between Russia and its 
democratic allies in the West is required now. We need new 
strategic schemes and mechanisms to implement them that would 
thoroughly reflect the current degree of maturity in our 
relations. And most important: One should proceed from promises 
of large scale cooperation made to Russia in Tokyo to the 
fulfillment of those promises. 
  In the process of establishing a new architecture of Europe 
it is important to take into account a number of criteria, such 
as: 
  -- a balanced approach, in subsequent stages to the European 
security system. The methods of ``shock diplomacy'' and the 
policy of the ``fait accompli'' should be excluded. The Russian 
side is in favor of broad consultations with all the interested 
states. 
  -- the open nature of regional organizations and 
institutions 
as a guarantee of their appropriate adaptation to the current 
European realities. Russia has no right to dictate who should 
and who should not join NATO, but we have the right to count on 
the fact that the North Atlantic Alliance will take into account 
the particularities of the transition period, which is 
inevitably a long-term process. And if we were to talk about a 
longer term process, it should confirm the position included in 
the documents through which NATO declares itself open to accept 
all democratic states in the Euro- Atlantic region. One should 
not exclude a priori that in the future Russia will also request 
to be accepted into NATO. It is important to ensure an 
effective partnership, based on equal rights in the period of 
transition and of mutual adaptation. 
  -- ensuring an equal level of security for each European 
state. The emergence of ``first degree security and second 
degree security,'' of ``gray zones,'' of ``special spheres of 
influence,'' of ``isolated regions,'' or of ``cordons 
sanitaires'' in Europe are inadmissible. 
  -- the preservation of a contract-juridical base for 
European 
security. 
  -- the elimination of territorial claims in interstate 
relations in Europe. 
  The major goals of the strategy of partnership that we are 
proposing in the political sphere and in the area of security 
must be the following: 
  -- First: to develop Euro-Atlantic cooperation. The CSCE 
should be turned into a political organization for all the 
regions (a general regional organization), and the North 
Atlantic Cooperation Council into an organization of independent 
political and military cooperation, but closely connected with 
the CSCE. Their goal should be to coordinate the efforts of 
NATO, the Western European Union, and the CIS on international 
security, achieving peace, and ensuring the active defense of 
the European ethnic minorities' rights to their language and 
other rights. I believe that a great step in this respect would 
be to adopt at the Rome session of the CSCE a declaration on 
fighting aggressive nationalism. 
  -- Second: to create a system of mutual guarantees for the 
security of Central and Eastern European countries. The 
stronger interstate relations are, the more durable the nature 
of their relations will be. 
  -- Third: I welcome the proposal of my German colleague 
Kinkel to conclude certain conventions of cooperation and 
consultation between NATO on the one hand and Central and 
Eastern European countries, Russia, and Ukraine on the other. 
The opening of a NATO- CIS communications channel would also be 
useful. 
  -- Fourth: to increase the capacity of European countries to 
ensure peace. For the time being, we should say it openly, East 
and West have not found a common way to respond to local 
conflicts in Yugoslavia or the former USSR, although meanwhile 
these conflicts have become a great problem for European 
security. 
  -- Fifth: to ensure the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons 
in Europe. It is not correct to present the Russian-Ukrainian 
dispute around the issue of strategic missiles as an episode in 
the process of dividing the Soviet inheritance. Here we are 
talking about ways to prevent the creation of a breach in the 
regime of nuclear nonproliferation. The strategy of European 
partnership should foresee strong encouragement for the strict 
observance of the accord on nonproliferation of nuclear weapon. 
  Certainly, separate discussions are required by the economic 
component of the partnership and the essence of those 
discussions would be to move from the stage of certain 
chronically delayed programs to moves to include Russia in the 
international division of labor on an equal basis and without 
discrimination, and to facilitate its access to European markets. 
  The dialogue on the issue of partnership for Europe is 
already actively developing. I hope that the NATO summit, 
through its balanced and farsighted decisions, will mark a 
useful contribution to the development of this dialogue. The 
members of the North Atlantic Alliance can find in Russia an 
interesting and responsible partner for drafting this strategy.

  [Text] Moscow January 24 TASS -- Russian Atomic Energy 
Minister Viktor Mikhaylov sent a letter to Interior Minister 
Viktor Yerin, requesting to take adequate measures to prevent 
Interior Ministry staff members from making reports on the 
situation at the Atomic Energy Ministry, ``which are based on 
fabrications and fantasies without appropriate scientific 
examination and documented confirmation.'' 
  The letter was prompted by the fact that Interior Ministry 
officials made statements for some mass media, alleging that 
thefts of arms uranium, plutonium and even nuclear warheads from 
facilities of the military-industrial complex and the Atomic 
Energy ministry have become an ordinary thing. 
  Mikhaylov claimed that there are no facts corroborating 
thefts of arms ploutonium and nuclear warheads from the 
ministry's facilities. If the Interior Ministry has such facts, 
they should be documented.

  [Text] [110625] [Tarasov over video of dummy wearing

100 of the world's countries signed a multilateral convention in 
Paris banning chemical weapons. 
  The manufacture of chemical weapons ended in the former USSR 
back in 1987. Nonetheless, Russia has inherited 40,000 tons of 
lethal fluids and gases. These are the biggest stockpiles in 
the world. The convention stipulates that by the beginning of 
the next century virtually no chemical weapons stockpiles will 
remain. Currently preparations for the destruction of these 
weapons are under way. The coordination of the efforts of 
ministries and departments has been entrusted to the Committee 
for Convention Problems.

<F P=106> [``Expert Analysis'' article by Igor Vlasov, head of sector </F>
of the Russian Federation President's Committee on Problems of 
the Chemical and Biological Weapons Convention: ``Chemical 
`Thorns' in the Country's Side'' -- passage within slantlines 
published in boldface] 
  [Text] The problem of the destruction of chemical weapons 
has alarmed the country's public. The sociopolitical situation 
has been sharply aggravated in the regions where it is planned 
to site installations for the destruction of the chemical 
weapons arsenal, and certain representatives of social movements 
are trying to exploit the currently fashionable topic of 
chemical disarmament in their own interests. Journalists are 
citing unverified facts, and people weighed down with science 
degrees are now trying to draw attention to themselves by making 
revelatory statements. The press increasingly often carries 
articles in which so-called chemical weapons experts who like to 
pose as major specialists try to intimidate the public with 
reports on the alleged continuation of scientific research into 
chemical weapons, their unauthorized destruction, secret burials 
on land and in water, and so forth. 
  In our view, such activity by ``experts'' and ``selfless 
campaigners'' is pursuing an unseemly aim: Using unverified and 
sometimes knowingly false statistics, they juggle this 
information around and impose on the public a distorted and 
unobjective view of the problem of the destruction of chemical 
weapons. 
  That is why I consider it expedient to examine consistently 
the basic stages in the implementation of the 1993 Convention on 
the Banning of Chemical Weapons. 
  First of all, I would recall that the state, which signed 
the 
Convention, is beginning work on the destruction of chemical 
weapons within a maximum of two years and will complete it no 
more than 10 years after the convention's entry into force. In 
the first stage, that is no more than two years after the 
ratification of the Convention, tests of the first facility for 
the destruction of chemical weapons will be carried out and 
then, no more than three years later, at least one percent of 
the stocks of these weapons is to be destroyed. In Russia's 
case this will mean 400 tonnes of toxic agents. In the 
subsequent stages, which are to be carried out no later than 
five, seven, and 10 years after the convention's entry into 
force, at least 20-45 percent of the weapons are to be 
destroyed, as are eventually all the remaining stocks of 
chemical weapons. Each state will choose its own method of 
destruction independently. It should be noted that the 
destruction process is to correspond to the very latest 
scientific achievements and be carried out at specially equipped 
sites. Meanwhile the destruction of toxic agents by burial on 
land, underwater, or by incineration in the open air is not 
permitted. 
  According to specialists' estimates, as far as Russia is 
concerned the Convention on Banning Chemical Weapons could come 
into force in 1995 and the operation of the first facility for 
the destruction of toxic agents could begin in 1997. Russian 
President B. N. Yeltsin made a statement in spring last year in 
which he said among other things: ``The world has changed, 
Russia's position in the world has changed, and we do not intend 
to attack anyone. The time has come to get rid of chemical 
weapons -- they are the past which we have inherited.'' Let us 
note that the problem of the destruction of chemical weapons is 
of great sociopolitical and social significance for Russia, due 
first and foremost to the need to lower the level of ecological 
tension in regions where the arsenals of these weapons are 
based. The program for the destruction of chemical weapons that 
the state is elaborating gives priority to the unconditional 
guarantee of safeguarding the life and health of the population 
as well as measures to protect the environment. 
  Social protection is also envisaged for the population 
living 
in zones where enterprises for the destruction of chemical 
weapons are to be sited: The latest technologies will be used 
and the volumes of toxic substances to be shipped across 
Russia's territory will be kept to a minimum. All this will 
involve considerable material expenditure especially since there 
is no special-purpose industrial facility for the destruction of 
chemical weapons in the Russian Federation. 
  The Committee on Problems of the Chemical and Biological 
Weapons Convention has been created to coordinate the 
verification of the fulfillment of international commitments in 
the sphere of the destruction of chemical and biological 
weapons. The policy of chemical disarmament in Russia has long 
needed an agency which would be independent of such powerful 
structures as the Defense Ministry and enterprises in the 
military-industrial complex, could carry out the process of 
disarmament in our country in a highly skilled and objective 
way, and could worthily represent Russia's interests in the 
international arena. Academician A. Kuntsevich, the well known 
scientist, was appointed chairman of this committee. In the 
past a military chemist, he made a major contribution to the 
creation of decontamination procedures which render toxic 
substances harmless and he set up a scientific school. 
  ...Today all Russia's chemical weapons stocks are housed in 
special-purpose arsenals of the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry -- these are the seven chemical ``thorns'' in Russia's 
side: the city of Kambarka and the settlement of Kizner 
(Udmurtia), the settlement of Gornyy (Saratov Oblast), the city 
of Shchuchye (Kurgan Oblast), the city of Pochep (Bryansk 
Oblast), the settlement of Leonilovka (Penza Oblast), and the 
settlement of Maradykovskiy (Kirov Oblast). The total quantity 
of chemical weapons is 40,000 tonnes, made up as follows: 
organophosphorous toxic agents (sarin, zamin [as 
transliterated], and VX) -- 32,300 tonnes; mustard gas, 
lewisite, and their compounds -- 7,700 tonnes; and phosgene -- 
5,000 tonnes. If the Paris convention is ratified, the process 
of the destruction of these weapons should begin in 1997. 
  To enable the Russian Federation to fulfill its 
international 
commitments, the Committee on Problems of the Chemical and 
Biological Weapons Convention under the Russian Federation 
President, in conjunction with the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry, the Russian Federation Ministry of Ecology, the 
Russian Federation Ministry of Health, the Russian Academy of 
Sciences, and other ministries, elaborated in 1992 the draft 
first stage of the comprehensive program for the destruction of 
chemical weapons. Leaders of local administrations and 
representatives of public organizations in those regions where 
it is planned to site facilities for the destruction of chemical 
weapons took part in the discussion of this program. The draft 
was adopted after comments, amendments, and clarifications. 
  An essential condition of work on the draft is the public 
discussion of proposed decisions, a state ecological feasibility 
study of them, and the elaboration of the corresponding 
legislative acts. It is also recommended that a federal 
targeted program be elaborated to eliminate the consequences of 
the production of chemical weapons on the territory of the 
Russian Federation. 
  The chemical ``thorns'' can be removed from Russia's side 
only if there is a skilled, comprehensive, and well-balanced 
approach to the problem of the destruction of chemical weapons 
and joint efforts by scientific specialists, state and public 
organizations, and the local administration and population of 
the regions where the installations for the destruction of 
chemical weapons, one of the most treacherous types of weapon of 
mass destruction, are to be sited.

<F P=106> [Unattributed reply to reader's letter under the ``Briefing </F>
for the Readers'' rubric: ``The 1,641th Underground Hiroshima''] 
  [Text] Will China's recent underground nuclear explosion 
not encourage Russia and the United States to carry out new 
nuclear tests? 
  [Signed] S. Boychenko, Lipetsk 
  The underground test in the PRC of a nuclear explosive 
device 
with a yield of 80-90 kilotonnes carried out 5 October last year 
has indeed complicated the situation. So far the leading 
nuclear powers have abided by their voluntary unilateral 
commitments to refrain from such actions ideally until the 
signing in 1996 of an agreement on a complete ban on underground 
nuclear explosions. Tests in the atmosphere, in space, and under 
water were banned earlier by the international treaty of 1963. 
  However, the members of the ``nuclear club'' decided not to 
follow China's example and will continue to observe the 
moratorium on underground explosions although both Russia and 
the United States proclaimed a little over four months ago their 
readiness not to hold such tests only so long as the other great 
powers refrained from them. So far only the leadership of 
France has expressed the theoretical possibility of staging a 
series of tests in the period up to 1996. 
  As of now the nuclear powers have officially given notice of 
2,166 nuclear test explosions (954 by the United States, 936 by 
the USSR, 192 by France, 44 by Britain, 39 by China, and one by 
India). Of that number the 1,641th nuclear device has now been 
detonated underground at the test sites shown on the attached 
map. [Note: A map accompanies the article showing test 
sites at Nevada, Mururoa, Novaya Zemlya, Semipalatinsk, Lopnor, 
and the Tar desert] 
  As far as is known, neither Russia nor Britain intends to 
detonate even those test charges that they have stored in 
underground galleries: In Russia's case at the test site in 
Semipalatinsk, in Britain's at the U.S. site in Nevada. So let 
us hope that 1994 becomes nuclear-free at least on the territory 
of the main nuclear countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with the head of the Moscow Center for Arms </F>
Control, Anatoliy Dyakov, by Andrzey Rybak; place and date not 
given: ``Still Under Control''] 
  [Text] 
  Rybak: Russia stores some 180 tonnes of 
weapons-grade plutonium, which is enough to produce 90,000 
nuclear warheads. But the Russians go on producing plutonium. 
Why? 
  Dyakov: This situation is far from logical to me 
also. Three reactors--two in Tomsk, one in Krasnoyarsk--are 
still producing weapons-grade plutonium. But they also generate 
electricity. If they were closed down, many people would be 
without electricity and heating. Yet, the government says there 
is another reason as well: The fuel used in the reactors cannot 
be stored for a long period. It has to be processed if even 
greater risks to humans and the environment are to be avoided. 
  Rybak: Russia is in the midst of an economic 
crisis. Does this have an effect on the destruction of nuclear 
weapons, as laid down in the START Treaties? 
  Dyakov: This is, indeed, a major financial 
problem. A total of 30,000 nuclear warheads are to be 
destroyed. Storing one gram of plutonium costs between $1 and 
$2 per year. The warheads contain a total of 60 tonnes of 
plutonium. This means that storing them alone would cost $60 to 
$120 million a year. The entire nuclear complex consumes some 
$1.5 billion per year. Using about 20 percent of capacity for 
disarmament would cost some $300 million per year. And the work 
will take 10 to 15 years. 
  Rybak: The United States promised Russia financial 
support for disarmament. 
  Dyakov: There is a $800 million fund. But this 
has been almost completely exhausted. 
  Rybak: The rich threshold countries are very much 
interested in Russian nuclear scientists. How big is the danger 
that they might sell their knowledge? 
  Dyakov: I, personally, do not know of any 
scientist of the ``inner circle'' who has emigrated to these 
countries. 
  Rybak: But an increasing number of them lose their 
jobs. Scientists at the secret nuclear complex Arzamas-16 were 
on strike recently because their salaries had not been paid. 
  Dyakov: The scientists' situation is very bleak. 
But I do not think this will lead to mass migration. 
  Rybak: In Germany and Poland there have been 
several cases of smugglers being arrested with nuclear material. 
  Dyakov: This was only slightly enriched uranium 
that is not suitable for weapons. As to the military nuclear 
complex, the situation is still under control. 
  Rybak: Corruption is on the increase within the 
Russian Army. All kinds of weapons are being stolen and sold. 
Why not nuclear weapons? 
  Dyakov: Your concern is justified. If everybody 
steals, including government personnel, you cannot expect the 
Army to be any better. 
  Rybak: The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty will 
expire in 1995. What will happen then? 
  Dyakov: I think that the Treaty will simply be 
extended. I hope that we will finally achieve a ban on tests. 
  Rybak: In spite of the Nonproliferation Treaty, 
Iraq and North Korea have almost finished developing the bomb. 
How can such things be prevented in the future? 
  Dyakov: We have to put heavy pressure on such 
countries, impose economic sanctions. But we must also stop 
discriminating against the threshold countries. We cannot 
modernize our arsenals and prohibit them from developing the 
bomb. The First World must set an example by completely 
destroying its nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- The Russian atomic power 
industry will apparently soon get a safe reactor for nuclear 
power plants. Its new version was suggested by Russian 
scientists. 
  Academician and Nobel prize winner Nikolay Basov, who heads 
the development project, told ITAR-TASS that ``the new reactor 
is a hybrid model, because it incorporates both nuclear and 
thermonuclear sub-systems.'' ``Time has forced us to make use of 
this `combination'. Russia has accumulated large stockpiles of 
uranium and plutonium as a result of disarmament and curtailed 
research in the sphere of nuclear energetics. They can be 
successfully used in the new reactor,'' Basov stated. 
  A laser will play the role of a high-intensity neutron 
source 
in the new reactor. 
  The results of the already staged experiments speak in 
favour 
of this type of a hybrid nuclear-thermonuclear reactor.

  (Text] Dubna, 18 Jan -- A new nuclear accelerator operating 
through superconductivity and a new cyclotron -- these two major 
physics ``machines'' have been created and are operating at the 
Combined Nuclear Research Institute [CNRI] at Dubna near Moscow. 
This was announced today at a session of the CNRI's academic 
council, which is summing up last year's results and planning 
work for the future. 
  Despite the economic difficulties that science in Russia is 
experiencing, the CNRI is developing as a major international 
center in many fields, said Vladimir Kadyshevskiy, CNRI director 
and a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. 
He noted that the institute had integrated basic research into 
the structure of matter, the designing and application of new 
technologies, and university teaching in the relevant fields of 
knowledge. 
  The institute's international courses last year on 
``Radiation safety: physical, medical, biological and ecological 
aspects (the lessons of Chernobyl)'' helped expand the subject 
matter of teaching at the CNRI university and the establishment 
of new contacts. Now documents are being prepared on the 
organization of a UNESCO-IAEA faculty in Dubna with the same 
specialization, and it is planned to organize a faculty of 
economics in cooperation with Moscow University. 
  Taking part in the work of the Scientific Council are 
experts 
from Germany, since a routine agreement has been concluded 
between the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology 
and the CNRI on the use of the institute's installations up to 
the end of 1996. In this way physicists from one of the leading 
European states have shown an interest in the development of 
Dubna Physics Center.

power generation concept; figures in brackets denote broadcast

  [Text] [131118] [Unidentified correspondent over 
video of exterior, interior of unidentified nuclear power 
station] As is generally known, despite all the advantages 
of electricity generation at nuclear power stations, there is 
also one great disadvantage -- the likelihood of the occurrence 
of an uncontrolled reaction, an explosion, or a meltdown of the 
active zone of the reactor. We all recall the Chernobyl tragedy 
and other similar accidents. 
  Now a new concept has been submitted to the European 
Organization for Nuclear Research -- generation of electricity 
at a nuclear power station linked with a particle accelerator. 
The new reactor will be operating in a subcritical mode which 
rules out the occurrence of a chain reaction. The electricity 
will be supplied from particle accelerators. According to 
experts the new power generation technique will be competitive 
since it does not require new technological development while at 
the same time providing an ecologically relatively clean, 
inexhaustible, and reliable source of energy. [131205]

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Gubarev: ``Prepare the Candles, Ladies </F>
and Gentlemen! The Shutting Down of Nuclear Power Stations 
Presages a Power Catastrophe''] 
  [Text] It could happen as early as February. The Russian 
president and government will find it necessary to introduce a 
state of emergency. This was stated by directors of nuclear 
power stations who gathered in Moscow. They warned that, as 
early as February, the Leningradskaya, Smolenskaya, Kurskaya, 
Novovoronezhskaya, Kolskaya, and Bilibinskaya power stations 
will be unable to operate, and hence they will have to shut down 
their reactors. 
  Yes, the ``greens'' who have been ``at war'' for some years 
now with the aid of their Western colleagues against Russia's 
nuclear electric power stations [AES's] can celebrate a 
``victory.'' In the situation which has developed our power 
stations are simply physically incapable of operating, since 
there is no fuel, it is impossible to carry out systematic 
repairs, and there is no money to buy spare parts and 
consumables. And this is at a time when the only sector in 
Russia which has not decreased production since 1991 and has not 
permitted a slump [sentence as published]. Moreover, on the 
results of the work for 1993 our nuclear power stations were 
superior in virtually all indicators to the AES's of France and 
the United States. This applies to the reliability of 
operation, the number of breakdowns, and the performance of the 
service personnel. These are not ``our'' statistics, but the 
conclusions of international experts and organizations. 
  It should be remembered that in the European part of Russia 
AES's produce almost one-half of the electricity, and one-fourth 
of this goes to such centers as Moscow and St. Petersburg. Add 
to this the fact that ``nuclear'' electricity is two to three 
times cheaper than the price which we, the consumers, have to 
pay. Therefore, the shutdown of AES's will at the very least 
provoke a two- to threefold increase in tariffs; but we are 
already used to this.... But something else is more dangerous: 
Stations are turning from producers into mighty consumers of 
energy, since this is required in order to maintain safety. And 
you can't just ``hit the switch''--we all know full well what 
happened at Chernobyl. 
  And there is no use in hiding it, because of the shutdown of 
enterprises--including chemical, metallurgical, and machine 
building enterprises--an electricity surplus has developed in 
Russia. Electricity is mainly generated by coal and other 
thermal stations, and consequently, the ecological situation is 
sharply deteriorating. Discharges into the atmosphere of all 
manner of substances harmful to man and life in general will 
increase dramatically. Here is a truly ``Pyrrhic victory'' for 
ecology! 
  Surely we can learn something from the experience of 
Armenia, 
where the decommissioning of AES's led to catastrophe? Or from 
the sad experience of Ukraine, where the power situation 
provoked a disastrous slump in industry and agriculture, and 
therefore, in the life of society as a whole? Do we really 
prefer to learn from our own mistakes? However, there is not 
long to wait: If we do not intervene in the fate of Russia's 
nuclear power stations today, within a month we will find out 
what a power crisis is really like.... So prepare the candles, 
ladies and gentlemen! 
  The directors of Russia's AES's, who gathered at the 
``Rosenergoatom'' concern for their emergency meeting, see as 
the main culprit of their woes the ``supermonopoly structure of 
the RAO `YeES Russia' [Russian joint-stock company `Integrated 
Energy System of Russia']--the sole consumer of our output.'' 
In their appeal to B. Yeltsin and V. Chernomyrdin they laid 
special stress on this fact. 
  And it is possible to understand the directors: Any monopoly 
is harmful. The RAO buys energy from nuclear stations and, as 
is the custom with us, does not pay for it in full. But the RAO 
also does not receive money from consumers--it is probably 
impossible to find one enterprise today which has paid for the 
electricity it has received. Moreover, even our neighbors in 
the nearby foreign parts prefer not to pay--there are more than 
sufficient examples of this. 
  Effectively Russia has provided just over 3 trillion rubles' 
[R] worth of electricity free of charge over the past few 
years--they took it and did not pay! You might think that we 
were already living under communism.... No, not ``we,'' but a 
great many enterprises and republics; and ``we'' are forced to 
pay over the odds for our light and heat. 
  The nuclear physicists work well. And the government 
understands this: It is no accident that the country's top 
leadership listened attentively to their problems. And hence 
the directors of Russia's AES's write in their appeal: 
  ``We thank our government for the fine decisions aimed at 
stabilizing the financial position in nuclear power engineering 
which it made in October-December of last year and which have 
been sunk by the prevailing reality existing in our country, 
where it is not the decisions of the government or the president 
that are fulfilled, but those of structures of the type of the 
RAO `YeES Russia' and people who prefer to burn scarce organic 
fuel, rather than deliver cheap power from AES's to consumers.'' 
  The directors go on to cite a surprising fact: ``Of the 
credits worth R70 billion allocated by the government in October 
1993 to pay for energy delivered from AES's, in three months 
only R6 billion has reached the AES's; R30 billion of the 
indicated sum for some reason was left in a commercial bank'' (I 
omit the name of the bank so as not to give it further 
publicity--V.G.). True, the AES directors are mistaken here: 
The money was not ``left'' in this bank for two months, but was 
successfully ``put to work''--it brought in to the bank twice 
the amount, since the ``nuclear R30 billion'' really ``did its 
stuff.'' And very few employees of the bank cared that at some 
nuclear power stations employees are not receiving their pay.... 
  No, the employees and directors of Russia's AES's are not 
threatening a strike: They understand full well how serious the 
situation is today in power engineering and industry, but are 
warning the president, the government, and all of us, that they 
will be forced to shut down AES's, since their duty as 
professionals and as human beings forbids them to allow new 
Chernobyls. The AES directors clearly state that they cannot 
allow the slightest risk in the operation of AES's. But, to be 
honest, the AES directors no longer hope for help from the 
government, since not one of its decisions has been fulfilled.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Ladin report under the ``Events and Commentary'' </F>
rubric: ``Will Nuclear Charge Be Left to Our Descendants as a 
Memento? Semipalatinsk Test Site Continues To Pose Questions''] 
  [Text] At a meeting between Tulegen Zhukeyev, state 
counselor of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and journalists 
discussion again turned to the future of a nuclear device 
prepared for testing at the Semipalatinsk test site but still in 
an underground gallery, as the test site has been closed to date 
under an edict of the president of Kazakhstan. Nuclear tests 
have accordingly ended. 
  What, then, will become of the nuclear charge? What is its 
future? Could a spontaneous underground nuclear explosion 
eventually occur? These and other questions are worrying people. 
  The state counselor thinks the nuclear charge should be 
neutralized. However, according to him, Kazakhstan is unable to 
do this itself. Only those who prepared the charge and placed 
it underground for testing are capable of doing it. 
  However, as we have learned from informed sources, the 
nuclear charge's removal from the gallery entails very 
complicated engineering operations. This is not only expensive, 
it is dangerous too, as it was never planned that the device 
would be removed. It was prepared only for detonation and was 
carefully sealed up. 
  We have heard from certain officers at the test site that 
destroying the charge in situ would be the simplest and most 
expedient solution. That is to say, detonate it and let that be 
an end to the matter, particularly as its yield compared with 
those detonated at the test site in previous years is not very 
great. 
  But a new problem is coming to a head. The military unit 
which provided support services for tests at the Semipalatinsk 
site is being disbanded. Shortly there will be no one to remove 
or detonate the charge, depending on which decision is made. 
Perhaps our descendants will be left this ``surprise'' as a 
keepsake?

  [Text] Kiev, 11 Jan -- Anatoliy Shybiko, deputy chairman of 
the Ukrainian Republican Party, noted in an interview with a 
UNIAR correspondent that without having in front of him the 
agreement on liquidating Ukraine's nuclear arsenal and without 
understanding its point, it would be premature to give a 
preliminary assessment of this agreement. In his opinion, a 
final assessment of the agreement should be given only after a 
text of the agreement between Ukraine, Russia, and the United 
States becomes available. Mr. Shybiko is deeply convinced that 
Ukraine should remain a nuclear state for the near future and 
should accede to the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons as a nuclear state.

  [Text] Kiev, 12 Jan -- President Leonid Kravchuk's firm 
intention that the sovereign Ukraine should become a 
nuclear-free state has been confirmed once more today by Viktor 
Stelmakh, head of the press service of the Ukrainian president 
and Cabinet of Ministers, in a telephone conversation with the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. The president acts consistently in the 
spirit of the resolution, passed by the country's Supreme 
Council, on Ukrainian ratification of the well-known treaty on 
the destiny of the nuclear weapons on its territory, the head of 
Kravchuk's press service pointed out. 
  The occasion for the conversation at 0930, during which a 
real official statement was made, was the coming visit to 
Ukraine today of U.S. President Bill Clinton for a meeting with 
Kravchuk. The head of Kravchuk's press service said Clinton's 
arrival from Prague was expected here this evening at 1900 and 
his stay would last about two and a half hours. The Kiev 
dialogue would center on fundamental questions for the signing 
in Moscow, currently in preparation, of the trilateral treaty on 
nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Opposition to concluding the trilateral 
American-Russian-Ukrainian agreement on nuclear weapons on 
Ukraine's territory has sharply intensified in the parliament of 
Ukraine. Even moderate deputies now come out against the signing 
of such a document. According to them, the members of 
parliament were not even told about the treaty signed in Moscow 
by the presidents of the United States of America, Russia, and 
Ukraine. 
  In the opinion of the members of parliament, the signing of 
the Moscow treaty would mean that the president took a stand 
which totally differs from that approved by the parliament. The 
actions by Kravchuk play into the hands of Russia and the United 
States and were carried out by him under pressure, stated the 
members of parliament. Many of them say that they will come out 
against any attempt by President Kravchuk to ignore the 
reservations which were signed and expressed during the 
discussion dedicated to the ratification of the START I treaty. 
The communist deputies speak out for impeaching President 
Kravchuk if the trilateral Moscow agreement is signed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Oleksandr Rol, chairman of </F>
Ukraine's Officers Union, SOU, by Mariya Bazelyuk; place and 
date not given: ``The Defense of Ukraine Cannot be Guaranteed by 
Other States'' -- first paragraph published in boldface] 
  [Excerpt] The Fifth Congress of the Ukraine's Officers 
Union [SOU] held in Kiev on 18 December 1993 elected Major 
General Oleksandr Rol as the SOU chairman. Rol was born in 
Kiev, where he completed high school and received training at an 
aviation club. He studied at the Chernihiv Aviation School and 
later graduated from the Military Aviation Academy. He was a 
fighter pilot, a bomber pilot, and also did staff work. For 
three years, he was adviser to the commander of the Vietnamese 
Air Force. Even though Rol's military service was almost 
entirely outside Ukraine, he speaks very good idiomatic 
Ukrainian and this points to his family's healthy roots. 
for the state. [passage omitted] 
  Bazelyuk: Did you take part in elaborating the 
Ukrainian Military Doctrine? What is your opinion about it? 
  Rol: It is centered on defense. The doctrine 
adopted by the Supreme Council in October 1993 has become a 
state document, which soldiers must adhere to rather than assess. 
  Bazelyuk: However, it is written in the doctrine 
that ``Ukraine must become, in the future, a nonnuclear state if 
other nuclear powers undertake similar actions.'' After it 
became a state document, some people in the upper echelons of 
power rushed to transfer nuclear weapons immediately to Russia. 
What is your position with regard to our state's nuclear status? 
  Rol: Starting from 1991, I made many statements 
for the press and spoke from various rostrums. I said that 
Ukraine must have atomic weapons as a means of deterrence. Our 
state must possess nuclear weapons as long as at least one 
country, which may become our adversary and lead to a military 
confrontation, keeps its nuclear weapons. This is my opinion. 
No matter how big our army is, there is nothing like nuclear 
potential as a means for defending Ukraine. 
  The position of our political leadership has led to several 
negative processes. Back on 24 August 1991, Ukraine, for some 
reason, proclaimed to the whole world that it was going to 
become a nonnuclear state. Another example. Why, people are 
asking, does Ukraine need the Black Sea Fleet, if it declared 
that it only needs the fleet for local needs? This gave rise to 
the problem of the Black Sea Fleet with all its consequences. 
It is a pity that we gave away our tactical weapons so quickly; 
they might defend Ukraine much better than the largest army. It 
is impossible to guarantee national security without modern 
weapons. 
  Ukraine must proceed from the fact that it is impossible to 
ensure the defense of our state if we only rely upon guarantees 
offered by other states. In questions of Ukraine's defense 
capability and national security we may only rely upon our own 
forces. 
  Why does the West help Russia in every way? Simply because 
it has a powerful nuclear potential and is, in this respect, a 
strong power. 
  Bazelyuk: What are Ukraine's real possibilities 
for maintaining its nuclear status? 
  Rol: First and foremost, it is up to our 
president. We might conduct a nationwide referendum on 
Ukraine's nuclear or nonnuclear status. You know, I am very 
annoyed when some state tells us didactically: ``You must give 
up your nuclear weapons.'' Who would dare make such claims upon 
China, Great Britain, or France? 
  Bazelyuk: How do you assess that the personnel of 
the 43d Rocket Army has not, to this day, taken the oath of 
allegiance to Ukraine? 
  Rol: I will investigate this situation as chairman 
of the SOU. 
  Bazelyuk: You have been nominated as a candidate 
as Ukraine's people's deputy. Do you agree to stand for this 
post and why? 
  Rol: I agree, because I have a clear picture of my 
work in the Ukrainian Parliament. 
  Bazelyuk: Thank you for the interview, from which 
I have become convinced that, despite the enormous pressure 
exerted upon Ukraine both from the West and from the East, 
Ukraine will be able to create a reliable defensive shield with 
all those types of weapons necessary for this.

  [Text] Kiev, 14 Jan -- Ukrainian Parliament Speaker Ivan 
Plyushch is refraining from comment on the matter of the signing 
of the tripartite American-Russian-Ukrainian agreement, in 
accordance with which Ukraine is getting rid of virtually all of 
its nuclear potential, before the relevant documents are 
studied. Serhiy Kolesnyk, a member of the Commission for 
Defense Issues, and Andriy Pecherov, a member of the Supreme 
Council presidium, have refused to comment on the fact of the 
signing of the document. 
  Volodymyr Shcherbyna, leader of the ``New Ukraine'' faction, 
assessed the fact of the signing of the treaty positively, on 
the whole. Giving the reasons for his stance, he asked his 
opponents to reply to the question of whether they could re-aim 
the Ukrainian missiles from facilities in the United States to 
similar facilities in Russia? 
  People's deputy Vladyslav Nosov, secretary to the 
Constitutional Commission, said that by signing the agreement in 
Moscow today the president of Ukraine had exceeded his 
authority, because in accordance with the current Constitution 
he does not have the right to dispose of Ukraine's state 
property (in accordance with the Vienna Convention, the 176 
missiles and nuclear warheads on Ukrainian territory are 
Ukraine's property). According to Nosov, Kravchuk's actions can 
be assessed as an act of ``brutal arbitrariness.'' As regards 
impeachment, noted Nosov, the Constitutional Court, if there was 
one in Ukraine, would have to institute proceedings against the 
president of Ukraine. Nosov mentioned the vagueness of 
Ukrainian legislation as one of the reasons for Kravchuk 
violating the Constitution. 
  Mykhaylo Shvayko, deputy chairman of the Commission for 
Economic Reform, noted that the discussion of this treaty in 
parliament would be very stormy. It is not ruled out, 
emphasized Shvayko, that Kravchuk will provoke ``impeachment'' 
in the Supreme Council. 
  Volodymyr Kryuchkov, a member of the Commission for Issues 
of 
Defense and State Security, believes that implementation of this 
treaty is unrealistic both for Russia and for Ukraine. 
  It has been learned from informed sources that America is 
proposing compensation to Ukraine for the dismantlement of the 
missiles, which comes to approximately $1 billion. But the 
dismantlement of one complex of SS-24 missiles costs not less 
than $10 billion according to approximate calculations, and 
there are 46 such complexes in Ukraine. In addition, Ukraine 
currently has 136 (?SS-18) missiles.

  [Text] Lvov, 15 Jan -- The tripartite treaty on the 
elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, which has been signed 
in Moscow, will make it possible to deepen cooperation between 
Ukraine and other states and will meet with the understanding 
and support of the world community. This view was expressed 
today by the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Konstantin Zlenko [name 
as heard], Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, and Deputy Prime 
Minister Vasiliy Shmarov at a meeting with representatives of 
the diplomatic corps. 
  At the same time Ukrainian centrist and radical right-wing 
political parties showed a total lack of understanding of the 
signing of the treaty. In particular, the very large Rukh 
organization and the Conservative Republican Party assessed the 
actions taken by President Kravchuk as treachery. According to 
them, the document signed in Moscow covers not only liquid 
fuelled rockets but also solid fuelled ones, which are not even 
mentioned in the START I Treaty. 
  The pointer of the political barometer in Ukraine has moved 
toward tension. The sharp response has been softened to a 
certain extent by the Christmas holidays, which continue until 
19 January.

  [Editorial Report] Kiev Ukraiyinske Radio First Program 
Network in Ukrainian at 1305 GMT on 17 January carries a 
NEZHAVISIMOST program. This program lasts 45 minutes and in its 
first part presents an interview with Aleksandr Chalyy, chairman 
of the Legal Department within the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, 
and Konstantin Trishchenko, chief of the Department for Control 
Over Weapons and Disarmament within the Ukrainian Foreign 
Ministry by correspondent Syarhey Omelchuk. The second part of 
the program is a live phone-in question-and-answer program. The 
subject of the cast addresses the activities of Ukraine in the 
denuclearization sphere and results of the tripartite 
Ukrainian-Russian-U. S. negotiations in Moscow. 
  At 1313 GMT, touching upon opinions of various political 
groupings regarding the Moscow agreement, Aleksandr Chalyy says 
that ``this tripartite declaration is the logical continuation 
of Ukraine's political activities on the international arena,'' 
and it fully corresponds to clause No. 9 of the Declaration of 
the National Sovereignty of Ukraine. In addition, he recalls 
that 90 percent of the population backed the text of this 
Declaration and ``the Supreme Council has ratified the START 
treaty with reservations.'' Responding to the reporter's 
question on whether nuclear weapons are a deterring factor in 
relations with Ukraine's neighbors, the chairman of the Legal 
Department states that this theory was born in the USSR, and it 
demands the existence of reliable nuclear weapons and an 
aggressive military policy. ``Ukraine has no operational 
control over its nuclear weapons and this policy cannot be used 
by us. In addition, we cannot produce nuclear weapons,'' he 
adds. 
  At 1317, when asked to comment on security guarantees, 
Aleksandr Chalyy enumerates the principles -- territorial 
integrity, inviolability of borders, sovereignty, and 
independence of Ukraine -- saying that this document will be 
published tomorrow. Further, the talk shifted to prospects of 
the political development of Crimea. However, Mr. Chalyy 
refuses to answer this question and says that time will show 
what happens, however, the nuclear disarmament process does not 
in any case affect the political processes in the Crimea. 
``There are many regions even in Russia that want to become 
independent, however, Russian diplomacy is very careful in 
meeting their demands.'' 
  At 1328 GMT, queried on the compensation mechanism, 
Konstantin Trishchenko recalls the Massandra agreement and 
Geneva negotiations on the issue and reminds that ``Ukraine will 
receive free fuel for its nuclear power plants and new jobs will 
be created in the atomic power engineering field.'' 
  In the second part of the program, at 1337 GMT, the 
listeners 
again ask about security guarantees for Ukraine and compensation 
for the Republic. Konstantin Trishchenko recommends that they 
read tomorrow's newspapers and repeats that the United States is 
a stable guarantor of Ukraine's security. Next, some listeners 
ask about the possibility of ratifying this agreement in the 
Supreme Council. Konstantin Trishchenko responds that the 
tripartite international treaty will be ratified ``by all 
means.'' 
  The final questions [1345 GMT] concern the general situation 
in the world regarding the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. 
The end of the program is unmonitorable.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 18 TASS -- ``We are able to remove 
all nuclear warheads stationed on the Ukrainian territory to 
Russia within a year for subsequent dismantling them at 
enterprises at which they were produced,'' Colonel-General 
Yevgeniy Maslin, a military expert for nuclear safety and a 
department chief of the Russian Defence Ministry, told a 
briefing here today. 
  He highly assessed an agreement on the removal of nuclear 
weapons from the Ukrainian territory, signed by the three 
presidents. Maslin reminded of the fact that talks on this 
problem had been going on since 1992 and it was only now that 
the talks came to a logical end. 
  Maslin informed journalists that currently, there are 176 
launching installations of intercontinental ballistic missiles 
(IBM) in Ukraine, including 130 installations of SS-19 type and 
46 of SS- 24 type. There are also around 40 heavy bombers 
Tu-160 and Tu-95 capable of launching air-based long-range 
cruise missiles. The overall number of warheads stationed in 
Ukraine includes 1,300 warheads for IBM and over 600 warheads 
for air-based cruise missiles. 
  In the opinion of the military expert, nuclear safety in 
Ukraine causes permanent concern of experts. According to 
Maslin. Ammunition depots are overloaded with warheads and 
nuclear ammunition removed from combat alert, which resulted in 
a considerable increase of the radiation level. This was 
confirmed by experts of the Russian nuclear centre 
``Arzamas-15'' who visited Ukraine in September, 1993. 
  The designed life of the majority of warheads has expired, 
while maintenance preventive checks had not been carried out and 
some missiles are currently in a critical condition. As an 
example, Maslin mentioned three nuclear warheads which had to be 
hastily removed from the Ukrainian territory as they were in a 
critical condition. It is difficult to say how many hazardous 
warheads are in Ukraine yet because there is a lack of experts 
exercising control over the safety of nuclear weapons, Maslin 
said. 
  The expert pointed out that any delay in removing and 
dismantling nuclear weapons is inadmissible since it is fraught 
with unpredictable consequences. However, there are still 
people in the republic who either do not realise this or are 
deliberately playing out ``the nuclear card,'' he said. 
  Maslin pointed out that Russian experts can give ukraine 
guarantees of safety of all operations in the process of removal 
and utilization of strategic weapons.

  [Text] A news conference was held at the Russian Ministry 
of Defense today. The military and political aspects of the 
Moscow summit meeting were discussed at the news conference. 
Viktor Levin, our observer, reports. 
  Levin: Colonel-General Maslin, chief of a main 
directorate of the Russian Defense Ministry, introduced by the 
Minister's Press Secretary (Yelena Agapova) as the chief 
specialist in the area of nuclear safety, dwelt in detail on the 
issue of the state of nuclear arms in Ukraine. 
  [Begin Maslin recording] In their statement, the 
presidents emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety and 
reliability of nuclear weapons until they are dismantled. 
However, nuclear safety in Ukraine is continuing to get worse. 
Storage facilities are more than full with warheads and nuclear 
ammunition which have been stood down. This is impermissible. 
Apart from everything else, it has resulted in a considerable 
increase in background radiation. This is confirmed by the 
chief design specialists from Arzamas-16 who visited the 
territory of Ukraine, Pervomaysk, in September last year. 
  Guarantees on most spare parts have run out. Regular 
technical servicing is not being done everywhere. The findings 
of the chief designers who investigated those three munitions, 
you remember, the ones which were sent from Ukraine because they 
were in a very dangerous state, landed on my desk yesterday. 
  Specialists are neither trained nor retrained in educational 
centers. Due to a lack of effective control, the personnel's 
theoretical knowledge and practical skills have been 
substantially lost and this engenders a great deal of doubt with 
regard to their capability for getting the work carried out with 
any degree of quality. 
  Due to lack of equipment and absence of field training, the 
special emergency repair crews are not in practical terms ready 
to carry out tasks dealing with the elimination of the 
consequences of possible accidents involving nuclear ammunition. 
There is a great deal more besides, affecting the servicing and 
maintenance. 
  Well, and it is in a situation such as this that proposals 
emerge within the military circles of the Ukrainian Defense 
Ministry to have the munitions moved to a former engineer depot, 
to have them stored there for a so-called interim period. Apart 
from everything else, this is very dangerous. [end 
recording] 
  Levin: I asked a question whether it is really the 
case that Ukraine fails to understand that keeping nuclear 
weapons in such a poor technical state poses a threat to Ukraine 
itself. Here is General Maslin's reply. 
  [Begin Maslin recording] There exists, well, I am 
in touch with my Ukrainian colleagues practically from the very 
inception of the negotiating process. There are sensible people 
there who do understand this. However, there are also 
people--and I am not afraid to say so--who fail to understand 
this danger. 
  For some fifty minutes I had to address some committee, I no 
longer recall what they call it, the defense and security 
committee of the Ukrainian parliament. For fifty minutes I told 
them, in great detail, what nuclear ammunition is, what danger 
it poses, in the first place for Ukraine, but the questions that 
came afterwards dealt mainly with the costs--how much if we sell 
it to you. That is to say--I would not like to offend anyone by 
this--but nonetheless, the statements, you have after all 
noticed that statements have appeared in the press alleging 
treachery, well, these are the people who do not understand and 
they fall into one category. 
  There is a second category of people who do understand, but 
who wish to retain their positions in the new structures that 
emerged there to supervise the nuclear weapons. My former 
subordinates are there, too, working and unwilling, to some 
extent, to part with these weapons and probably this can serve 
as an explanation. [end recording] 
  Levin: The trilateral agreement between Russia, 
Ukraine and the USA removes financial problems. It is now up to 
the Ukrainian parliament and its political will.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Pogorelyy report: ``Why Russia Is Concerned''] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Defense Ministry held a press conference 
for Russian and foreign journalists devoted to the 
military-political aspects of the Russian and U.S. presidents' 
Moscow summit meeting. Leading experts in the nuclear missile 
sphere--Colonel General Yevgeniy Maslin, chief of a Russian 
Defense Ministry main directorate; Major General Anatoliy 
Svetikov, first deputy chief of the Strategic Missile Forces 
Main Staff Operational Directorate; Major General Anatoliy 
Lukyanov, deputy chief of the Russian Defense Ministry 
International Treaty Directorate; and Boris Gorobets, spokesman 
for the Ministry of Atomic Energy--answered journalists' 
questions. 
  They all revealed the complexity not only of the 
military-political, but also of the military-technical aspects 
of the problem of the nuclear potential in Ukraine and once 
again underlined not only the political significance of the 
tripartite agreement on eliminating these weapons, but also the 
considerable contribution it makes to strengthening nuclear 
security--provided that the matter is resolved positively. Col. 
Gen. Yevgeniy Maslin reminded the press conference that it is a 
question of around 1,300 warheads [boyegolovka] for SS-19 and 
SS-24 missiles and 600 air-launched cruise missile warheads 
[golovnaya boyevaya chast]. The general said that this arsenal 
causes most profound concern in Russia. 
  The point is that the state of these warheads is still 
deteriorating. The warranty periods of most of the munitions' 
components are expiring and they are not undergoing the 
requisite technical maintenance, while maintenance personnel 
lack the requisite level of both theoretical and practical 
training. The complexity of the situation is indicated not 
least by the fact that three warheads were recently delivered to 
Russia from Ukraine in a preaccident state. 
  Our country does indeed have the technology to dismantle and 
salvage the nuclear munitions, but time is pressing on. It is 
no coincidence that it was specifically said during the summit 
meeting that the first consignment of 200 warheads must arrive 
at Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy enterprises for elimination 
within the next 10 months. 
  Nor has Kiev's desire for material compensation been 
forgotten--in exchange for the aforementioned first [consignment 
of] 200 warheads Ukraine will receive 100 fuel assemblies for 
nuclear power stations from Russia. Further payments are to be 
determined. If that does not seem enough to Ukraine, it was 
said at the press conference, the following legitimate question 
arises: Perhaps Ukraine does not want to part with its nuclear 
arms, contrary to its own declarations? 
  The press conference did not overlook the problem of mutual 
nontargeting of strategic nuclear missiles, enshrined in the 
Moscow declaration signed by Presidents Yeltsin and Clinton. 
When asked by your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent whether this 
clause contravenes the status of nuclear weapons as a means of 
deterring an aggressor (as in the ``Basic Provisions of Russian 
Federation Military Doctrine'') Generals Anatoliy Lukyanov and 
Anatoliy Svetikov replied that our nuclear arsenal does of 
course retain the functions of deterrence and intimidation. The 
fact that the missiles will not be targeted at the United States 
and Russia respectively in everyday life, a sign of the new 
quality of the partnership relations between the two countries, 
is another matter. Since the missiles nonetheless remain on 
alert duty, we can always resume the possibility of their combat 
use if necessary.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anton Buteyko, Ukrainian presidential </F>
adviser, by Francoise Delstanche in Brussels on 18 January: 
``Kiev Expresses its Faith in the Face of the Agreement on 
Denuclearization''; first four paragraphs are L'ECHO 
introduction] 
  [Text] Anton Buteyko believes that the West is focussing 
too much attention on nuclear affairs. Moderately optimistic 
about the nuclear agreement for the future since, according to 
him, the president has met Parliament's demands, Kravtchuk's 
adviser sees no progress being made on the dossier regarding the 
Black Sea fleet. 
  The tripartite agreement between the United States, Russia, 
and Ukraine, signed last Friday in Moscow, was saluted yesterday 
by the European Union as ``an important contribution to 
international security and stability,'' albeit on condition that 
it be implemented rapidly, failing which any delay would be 
considered with great anxiety. 
  The practical implementation of the agreement effectively 
depends on the backing of the Ukrainian Parliament in Kiev. Not 
directly, but with respect to the conditions that it imposed on 
the ratification of the Start I agreement on the reduction of 
strategic nuclear arms, and on the ratification of the treaty on 
nuclear nonproliferation, both of which Washington had laid down 
as preconditions. However, the Ukrainian leaders are proving 
relatively confident on these points. That is what was 
explained to us yesterday by Anton Buteyko in an interview given 
while passing through Brussels. However, he believes that the 
West is focussing too much attention on the nuclear problem and 
forgetting that other elements are emerging as definitely just 
as important. Consequently, he argues, the development of equal 
relations with the European Union would contribute to the 
stability of the region. 
  Moreover, in his opinion, only Ukraine can check the 
pressure 
in Russia caused by new political forces like that of 
Zhirinovskiy. For, in his view, the renaissance of these fascist 
movements is a menace not only to Ukraine, but also to Europe as 
a whole. 
  Delstanche: Do you think it will be easy to obtain 
the Ukrainian Parliament's support for the tripartite agreement 
on denuclearization? 
  Buteyko: The agreement does not formally require 
ratification. On the other hand, when Parliament ratified the 
Start I treaty, it voiced a certain number of reservations, in 
particular concerning the security guarantee for Ukraine, and 
the provision of technological and financial assistance in the 
context of disarmament. In fact, it must be clear that when 
Start I was negotiated, all the arms to be destroyed had to be 
eliminated using the combined economic resources of the USSR as 
a whole, whereas now we would have to destroy them using our own 
resources. That, however, is impossible in view of the economic 
crisis ravaging our country. Furthermore, the destruction of 
this arsenal will benefit the Western nations at which the arms 
in question were aimed. Therefore, it is logical that they 
should contribute to that process, for we are contributing to 
their security. Then again, Parliament has asked for 
compensation for the material contained in the tactical and 
strategic arms handed over to Russia. 
  In addition, it must be remembered that the negotiations 
were 
launched at the initiative of Ukraine, but that neither the 
United States nor Russia took our interests into account. It 
was Parliament's decision regarding the Start I treaty that 
provided a positive impulse in the negotiations. All the more 
so since we also understood that it was impossible to resolve 
certain matters on a bilateral basis. 
  Delstanche: So what is the next stage in the 
implementation of this agreement? 
  Buteyko: The president could now come to the 
Parliament and explain that he has met the conditions laid down 
when Start I was ratified, and that this treaty can now take 
effect. It will then be up to Parliament to approve the 
president's arguments, or not. 
  We think that Parliament will give us the green light, and 
we 
are going to work toward that. Admittedly, the approach of the 
March elections could lead some members of Parliament to exploit 
this to further their own personal interests, but despite all 
that I am continuing to hope that the ``ayes'' will have it. 
  Delstanche: And do you imagine achieving this 
during the present legislative period, which will end next March? 
  Buteyko: It is still our intention to achieve 
Parliament's backing, but if we do not, then we will be back in 
charge under the next Parliament. 
  Delstanche: A debate flared up last September 
between Kiev and Moscow regarding an agreement on the sale of 
the Ukrainian share of the Black Sea fleet to Russia in return 
for the cancellation of the bilateral debt. What stage have the 
talks on this subject reached? 
  Buteyko: At the end of the meeting on 3 September 
1993, a joint press release stipulated that the two delegations 
had to draw up recommendations over the following months on all 
the decisions made within that context, while taking account of 
all the ideas expressed and the specific agreements already 
concluded at that meeting. Since then, there have been two 
rounds of talks, but the Russians intend to consider only their 
own proposals. 
  Meanwhile, we have said that Ukraine would agree to divide 
the fleet in two, but not the associated elements of 
infrastructure. The Russians can by all means pay for using 
those. 
  Delstanche: And what about the bilateral debt? Is 
the fate of this debt still in abeyance? 
  Buteyko: Everyone in the West forgets that in 
September 1992 the heads of state of the CIS agreed to share out 
the property of the former USSR among the new states. Under the 
terms of this agreement, Ukraine should have received 16 percent 
of the assets of the old state, as well as gold and diamond 
reserves. However, Moscow never implemented this agreement. If 
our energy debt is compared with the Russian failure to return 
these assets to Ukraine, then it is Russia which is indebted to 
us, not the other way round. 
  Having said that, the tripartite agreement included the 
provision that compensation for the material contained in the 
arms will more or less cover the bilateral debt. The experts 
must now decide on the value of this material. 
  Delstanche: There are some people in Ukraine who 
seem to think that this agreement constitutes a victory for 
Russia above all... 
  Buteyko: This trilateral agreement opens up the 
way to the destruction of the nuclear monster, and the whole 
world will gain from this. However, even more specifically, it 
is Ukraine which insisted on continuing the negotiations on 
guarantees and compensation, and that is the reason why things 
have now been resolved. 
  So you can judge who the victor is. Which does not mean to 
say that Russia and the United States are also gaining from it. 
  Delstanche: Can Ukraine have faith in the Russian 
commitments regarding its security? 
  Buteyko: This aspect of the agreement still 
depends on the Ukrainian Parliament's ratification of the treaty 
on nuclear nonproliferation. However, if that is the case, then 
the two countries, the United States and Russia, undertake to 
respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine as 
well as the inviolability of its borders. In the past, this had 
never been recognized in any document coming from Moscow. 
Admittedly, in the past, many agreements have not been 
implemented, but now the United States is a party to the 
agreement, which gives us cause to hope that it will be 
respected.

  [Text] The trilateral statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia on the elimination of 
nuclear weapons on the territory of our state remains the focus 
of attention. If, in the world as a whole this move is 
supported on a mass scale, in Ukraine attitudes toward this 
statement and its assessments are ambiguous. Our correspondent 
Petro Ostapenko met Oleksandr Tarasenko, the deputy chairman of 
the Supreme Council of Ukraine's Commission for Issues of 
Defense and State Security, and asked him to express his 
attitude toward the trilateral statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia. 
  [Begin recording] Ostapenko: Ukraine's 
President Leonid Kravchuk and representatives of the executive 
bodies of power are saying today that the trilateral statement 
is the result and continuation, let us say, of the decisions by 
the Supreme Council on nuclear weapons. Oleksandr, what is your 
opinion? Is this true? 
  Tarasenko: Well, this document still needs 
in-depth comprehension. First, it is called a statement, a 
trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United 
States, and Russia. How should we assess it today? Does it 
have a legal force as an international document and as an 
agreement, or is this just a statement? Upon studying it 
profoundly -- yesterday our commission was considering this 
document -- upon studying it profoundly, it can, in the long 
run, be qualified as an international agreement. In compliance 
with our current legislation -- the Constitution first and 
foremost -- and in compliance with the law on the president, on 
his plenary powers, the international agreements that Ukraine -- 
that is, the executive power, concludes in the field of defense, 
military construction, military relations with neighboring and 
other states, are subject to mandatory ratification by the 
Supreme Council. 
  Why did I say that this document is an agreement and not a 
statement? Because, there is a supplement to the trilateral 
statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States, and 
Russia as of 14 January, and this supplement provides specific 
dates, the terms in which our strategic nuclear weapons should 
be fully deactivated, their number, and so on. This goes beyond 
the limits of the resolution that was adopted by the Supreme 
Council. What does this supplement stipulate? This supplement 
gives, for example, such parameters: Ukraine ensures the 
elimination of all nuclear weapons, including strategic 
offensive weapons -- that is, strategic air force, TU-160 and 
other aircraft carrying nuclear missiles, located on its 
territory, in compliance with its relevant agreements within the 
term of seven years as is envisaged by the START I Treaty and 
within the context of the statement by the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine on Ukraine's non-nuclear status, all the RS-22 missiles 
-- to be more specific they are called SS-24 -- on Ukraine's 
territory will be deactivated within 10 months by means of 
removing their warheads. What does it mean? 
  You know that in two thirds of our silos, launcher vehicles 
are filled with liquid fuel -- that is, heptyl. The entire 
world already knows what kind of a liquid fuel this is. This 
heptyl is a super poisonous substance, and the launcher vehicle 
itself is even a bigger powder keg than the launcher vehicle and 
the warhead as a whole. Proceeding from this, Ukraine and its 
plenary bodies and persons must take into account their own 
interests, first and foremost, and not the interests of those 
who benefit from this unilaterally. I believe that the Supreme 
Council, either the present or the future one, should seriously 
ponder over this document, and it can be ratified only after its 
parameters are specified. 
  Ostapenko: I am sorry to interrupt you. You have 
just read out the item that has to do with all sides without 
exception. But nothing is said here about the Supreme Council 
resolution on the ratification of START I with reservations. It 
clearly stipulates that 36 percent of launcher vehicles and 42 
percent of warheads are subject to elimination today. That is 
to say, these parameters have been extended to all nuclear [word 
indistinct]. 
  Tarasenko: Absolutely. They run contrary to the 
Supreme Council resolution. The Supreme Council resolution and 
START I envisage percentage and here is says about the complete 
elimination. 
  In this connection I would like to say the following, so 
that 
our radio listeners and our compatriots, our half-brothers, as 
they say, would know it: All those strategic nuclear systems 
located on the territory of Ukraine are targeted at certain 
objectives in the United States of America and relevant bases 
beyond the borders of the U.S. Correspondingly, approximately 
the same number of nuclear weapons are targeted at our 
territory. Well, this is military strategy and tactics and 
there is nothing incomprehensible here. Everybody understands 
this: If you target me, then I target you. But this document 
should also envisage adequate moves on the part of the United 
States of America, and our control over this, because everyone 
will control us, control how we eliminate nuclear weapons, 
remove nuclear warheads, transfer them from Ukraine to Russia. 
The only thing envisaged here is that Ukraine will have the 
possibility to control Russia neutralizing the nuclear warheads. 
However, this agreement does not envisage what the United 
States will do with that quantity of strategic nuclear weapons 
that are targeted at us, and what will be Ukraine's role in 
carrying out control over this process, as far as the actions of 
the United States are concerned. 
  Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin declared that they would 
decode their missiles, which would then be retargetted at some 
deserted islands, or something like that. Ukraine's 
participation here is not envisaged, is that right? 
  Tarasenko: Ukraine's participation here is not 
envisaged. Moreover, I disagree with such a stand, just as a 
citizen and just as an inhabitant of this planet Earth. If 
Ukraine eliminates these weapons, the former weapons of the 
Soviet Union, as is known, then the United States of America 
should eliminate and neutralize the same quantity of weapons. 
This is what we are talking about, not about retargetting at 
some other states, and so on. That is to say, there is no 
alternative in the world to universal nuclear disarmament and 
appropriate actions by all nuclear states. This is what our 
politicians should insist on, and at this point I again repeat 
and emphasize that the given document needs in-depth 
comprehension in legal terms, in terms of international law. 
What obligations, what guarantees can we talk about? Because, 
they already guaranteed us something to a certain extent. Let 
us not mention any names today, because there has already been 
enough talk about this. Who is to blame and who, let us say, 
ordered the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons from the 
territory of Ukraine? Those are our weapons. They would have 
been of paramount importance for the defense capacity of 
Ukraine. However, we transferred those weapons and could not 
cope with these ones. Here we outwitted ourselves. 
  Ostapenko: I know, Oleksandr, that you are 
familiar with the technical condition of the strategic nuclear 
weapons, missiles, and warheads located on Ukraine's territory. 
Today, in numerous interviews, the military say that it is 
difficult for Ukraine to service them, that Ukraine will be 
unable to service them, therefore, the sooner we deactivate and 
transfer these weapons, the better for Ukraine. What do you 
think about it, please. 
  Tarasenko: You, Petro, probably touched upon a 
very important aspect of this problem. It is quite clear that 
nuclear warheads and their systems are the most sophisticated 
systems because they should be sophisticated as they guarantee 
the safety of a nuclear warhead itself and a silo as a whole. 
This is why there exists a practice in the world according to 
which the given warheads are serviced by the authors who 
manufactured them. The authors themselves can destroy them. 
There is no other process, as they say. In this respect, we 
could find a state that would do this [word indistinct] but we 
cannot do this without Russia because the one who will have 
access there should know what it is, and so on. Therefore, every 
launching system and, moreover, nuclear warhead has relevant 
terms which guarantee their safety, and systems. We cannot do 
this without Russia. Therefore, it is necessary either to have 
very specific, responsible bilateral agreements toward that end 
with Russia on ensuring periodic servicing of the warheads and 
the silos as a whole or to neutralize and transfer them after 
their guaranteed service life expires. There is no other way 
around. Also, it could be possible to do as follows: A certain 
number of warheads and silos could be dismantled without their 
periodic servicing after their guaranteed service life expires. 
This is the way to follow. This would be the most correct, most 
appropriate way. Following it, one should move from the 
warhead, from the head, as they say, to the tail. That is to 
say, to dismantle the entire silo and not just remove the 
warheads and leave the rest with ourselves. It would be the 
same kind of a powder keg. Therefore, the most correct way is 
to act in line with a stage-by-stage, unit-by-unit principle. 
Both the warhead and the launcher vehicle should be dismantled 
completely. This would ensure the highest level of security to 
our state. 
  Ostapenko]:One more, very important aspect, as far 
as this problem is concerned. Did you see the guarantees of 
Ukraine's national security in this statement and in the 
supplement, the guarantees that Ukraine and the Supreme Council 
were striving for and which all those living in Ukraine wish to 
have. 
  Tarasenko: Undoubtedly, there are certain aspects 
and elements of security here. There are such provisions, and 
so on. But, as they say, history and mankind know instances 
when such guarantees were given, when there were agreements, but 
there was the Second World War despite these bilateral and 
multilateral agreements, and 22 million people died and the 
economies in a whole number of countries were destroyed. This 
is why one should rely on God but have his own mind, as they 
say. Both our military and scientific potentials should work 
toward ensuring our state security -- not at the expense of 
nuclear weapons now but at the expense of other highly effective 
means. Such measures are being taken today. This is why, 
simultaneously with the reduction and elimination of nuclear 
weapons, fulfilling that resolution by the Supreme Council, we 
should work concurrently toward ensuring the combat readiness of 
our Armed Forces. Our commission, together with military 
departments, is carrying out this work. [end recording] 
  Announcer: Such is the attitude of people's 
deputy, deputy chairman of the Supreme Council Commission for 
Issues of Defense and State Security Oleksandr Tarasenko toward 
the trilateral statement by the presidents of Ukraine, the 
United States, and Russia on the elimination of nuclear weapons 
in Ukraine.

  [Text] Kiev January 25 TASS -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk called upon the parliament to revise its attitude 
towards the ratification of the US-Soviet Strategic Arms 
Reduction Treaty (START-1) and the 1992 Lisbon Protocol. 
  An official letter by the president insisting that Ukraine 
should join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] was 
distributed among Ukrainian lawmakers on Tuesday. 
  Last November the Ukrainian parliament ratified the START-1 
imposing several tough conditions and stating that Ukraine 
should not join the NPT. 
  Ukraine's membership of the NPT was one of the key issues of 
the tripartite meeting of the Russian, American and Ukrainian 
presidents in Moscow. 
  The Ukrainian parliament is to consider the Moscow statement 
of the three presidents later this week.

  [Excerpts] Kiev, 25 Jan -- The Supreme Council of Ukraine 
began its session today under the chairmanship of Speaker Ivan 
Plyushch. [passage omitted] 
  With regard to the issue of Ukraine's accession to the 
nuclear arms nonproliferation treaty, Ivan Plyushch said that 
the last time parliament discussed the issue was on 18 November 
1993, when it adopted reservations concerning ratification of 
the START treaty. Since then, the president of Ukraine has 
carried out a great deal of work which resulted in the signing 
of the Moscow statement. 
  Plyushch said the president of Ukraine requested the Supreme 
Council to examine the issue of Ukraine's accession to the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty. However, the Supreme Council's 
three standing commissions which met 24 January with the 
participation of the working group dealing with ratification of 
the treaty, failed to find a common solution. 
  The parliament speaker said that this afternoon's session of 
the Supreme Council will look at the resolution on the state 
privatization program for 1994.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ihor Nedyukha, candidate of technological </F>
sciences: ``Once Again About the `Shield' and `Sword'''] 
  [Text] According to the press, the Ukrainian Nationalist 
Assembly [UNA] has sent the chairman of Ukraine's Security 
Service, Ye. Marchuk, a statement (the text was supplied), 
containing a request to evaluate President L. Kravchuk's 
activity during the negotiations with the presidents of the 
United States and Russia on Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. This 
statement, in fact, accuses the Ukrainian president of 
violations of the law to the extent of high treason. 
  However, the impression arises that the UNA leadership had 
not read Marchuk in HOLOS UKRAYINY 12 December 1992 where he 
insisted on the expediency of Ukraine's staying under the 
``nuclear shield of Russia,'' in other words, on the current 
policy of the total nuclear disarmament of Ukraine. 
  For that reason, I find it inappropriate to demand that 
Marchuk does the evaluation. This conclusion does not only 
apply to the UNA appeal, but also to the analogous statement by 
the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party [UKRP]. 
  The validity of the above interpretation is confirmed, at 
least, by the fact that the transfer to Russia of the ``Sword'' 
-- the tactical nuclear weapons -- is known to have been 
completed on the night of 5 and 6 May 1992. 
  It remains to be hoped that opponents of the Ukrainian 
president in the ranks of the UNA and UKRP will also agree that 
the same people must be among those who have planned and those 
who are implementing the measures for withdrawing the entire 
``Sword'' and ``Shield'' (strategic nuclear weapons) complex 
from Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Kostenko, Ukrainian environment </F>
minister and head of a parliamentary working group on START I 
and nuclear disarmament, by Vladimir Skachko: ```This Is Not 
Disarmament but Disrobing (razdevaniye, also meaning `robbing') 
of the State.' The Ukrainian Supreme Soviet Can Give a Legal 
Assessment of the Moscow Statement by the Three Presidents'' -- 
first paragraph is introduction; place, date not given] 
  [Text] Ivan Plyushch, speaker of the Ukrainian Supreme 
Soviet, has stated that the Supreme Soviet must decide on the 
question of compatibility of Ukraine's national interests with 
the statement signed by presidents of the United States, 
Ukraine, and Russia on the future of the Ukrainian strategic 
missiles and also consider a draft resolution on Ukraine's 
accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. According to 
Ivan Plyushch, because the resolution on joining the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty was prepared by the presidential 
services, the report on this matter should be made by President 
Leonid Kravchuk. Yuriy Kostenko, head of a special working 
deputies group on preparing the START I Treaty and on Ukraine's 
acquiring a nonnuclear status, and minister for environmental 
protection, commented for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the deputies' 
decision to return to these matters. 
  Kostenko: The Moscow tripartite statement has 
actually offered quite a different scheme of nuclear disarmament 
for Ukraine than what was decided on this score by our Supreme 
Soviet. This scheme does not take many aspects into account 
either from the viewpoint of national security or from the 
viewpoint of our economic interests. Therefore the Moscow 
statement must be considered in full as a separate agreement and 
be given an appropriate legal assessment. 
  Skachko: But this is a statement, not an 
agreement. The parliament may neither ratify it, nor fail to 
ratify it. 
  Kostenko: I understand this. The statement has 
been made in such a way that it could not be submitted to the 
consideration of the Supreme Soviet. This is so-called legal 
chicanery. Now, Ukraine's supreme legislative body adopts one 
scheme of nuclear disarmament while the executive branch, 
contrary to this, proposes a totally different one. Therefore 
the Supreme Soviet, in line with the current constitution and 
entitled to consider all international agreements, is also to 
consider this document as well as give it a proper legal 
appraisal and establish whether it is good for Ukraine. 
Possibly, it will have to be vetoed as a document which 
contradicts Ukraine's national interests. 
  Skachko: And presumably the parliament resolution 
on this question must be enforced? 
  Kostenko: This is undoubtedly the power of the 
Supreme Soviet. Moreover, I would like to point out that the 
work conducted by the Supreme Soviet will allow, in my opinion, 
more or less to balance Ukraine's interests with the interests 
of those who insist that Ukraine become nuclear-free. In the 
Moscow document I do not see either the economic interests or 
guarantees of Ukraine's security that many are talking about so 
much. 
  Skachko: How would you comment on the view that 
neither the statement nor the appendix to it contains a word on 
compensation for the tactical nuclear weapons evacuated to 
Russia? 
  Kostenko: This only shows once again that there is 
a certain contradiction between what our Supreme Soviet has 
adopted and what our president has signed. The parliament 
resolution clearly says that compensation must be made also for 
the tactical nuclear weapons, while the Moscow statement does 
not say anything about this separately. As far as I know, 
Russia apparently promises to consider this issue and provide 
some compensation after all. 
  Skachko: In other words, compensation for tactical 
nuclear weapons is a subject of separate talks between Ukraine 
and Russia? 
  Kostenko: Yes, talks on this issue have been going 
on, but it has not been settled conclusively yet because experts 
have been tasked to consider it and establish how exactly 
compensation will be made. 
  Skachko: Has any time frame been defined for 
making compensation to Ukraine for the tactical nuclear weapons? 
  Kostenko: No, no term has been established. This 
is very difficult to do because no one knows with what funds 
compensation will be made. If from the proceeds of the 500 
tonnes of enriched uranium that Russia is to sell to the United 
States, then this can happen only after this uranium has been 
sold on the world market. Only then will Russia start partially 
to receive real money and, naturally, will be able to make some 
compensation to Ukraine. At present, however, no such funds are 
available. True, there is also another option (which, 
incidentally, would be the most adequate for Ukraine): to 
evaluate the cost of each warhead. This is possible because it 
is known how much uranium and plutonium there is in each 
warhead. Therefore, using an equivalent, one could estimate the 
value of the tactical nuclear weapons that we have transferred 
to Russia. According to our preliminary estimates, the value is 
$10 billion. Assuming this sum, Russia is already in debt to 
Ukraine -- not the other way around, as some are trying to have 
us believe today. And if we talk about energy, then, given that 
uranium and plutonium are very valuable energy carriers, an 
equivalent exchange scheme could be used: We deliver highly 
enriched uranium and plutonium to them, and they supply us with 
oil and gas. But unfortunately this option has not been used; 
moreover, during the talks the subject of ``plutonium'' was 
somehow lost altogether. And it is a very costly element: one 
kilogram of enriched plutonium, according to various estimates, 
can cost up to $1 million, and one kilogram of enriched uranium 
up to $100,000. Now you can imagine the value of the material 
assets that we have already transferred to Russia. 
  Skachko: How much uranium and plutonium have you 
transferred to Russia? 
  Kostenko: Approximately 10 tonnes of enriched 
plutonium and more than 90 tonnes of enriched uranium. 
  Skachko: What is the correlation in parliament of 
people who advocate a solution of the problem of Ukraine's 
nuclear weapons on terms favorable for it and those who are 
ready to give the missiles away? 
  Kostenko: Judging by the results of voting during 
the ratification of START I, it can said that the majority of 
parliament members are inclined toward organizing a normal 
nuclear disarmament of Ukraine. But what has happened in Moscow 
is not nuclear disarmament but the disrobing of the state. In 
the military, economic, and political sense.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] 
  Unidentified announcer: Since there are certain 
complications ahead, I think it is too early to speak about the 
transportation of Ukrainian nuclear ammunition to Russia as an 
accomplished fact. Could you please tell us how long it may 
take to implement this process? It is not going to happen 
overnight, is it? 
  Unidentified speaker in Russian: I completely 
agree with you that this process will not be completed in one 
year. This is a lengthy process that will depend on technical 
conditions and safe transportation capabilities. To this end, 
the Ukrainian Defense Ministry is putting together timetables 
and plans to precisely observe each provision and rule out any 
off-chance accident. We cannot be even an iota wrong. This is 
why meeting all safety requirements for transportation will call 
for a considerable amount of time and effort on the part of the 
Defense Ministry officials and military officers who are experts 
on this issue. 
  In addition, the transportation and preparation for it will 
involve Russian specialists who developed and utilized this 
nuclear ammunition. Everyone is asking today: When will the 
first and the last [warhead] be removed? The defense minister 
has made it perfectly clear: The state has to have state 
secrets. Today, making public when a nuclear load will be 
transported through the Ukrainian territory -- which is a 
distance of from 721 km to 1223 km to our eastern border... This 
is a long distance. And we must secure safe conditions for this 
transportation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] An attempt to smuggle 1.5 kilograms of enriched 
uranium has been cut short in Odessa. According to information 
from employees of the criminal investigation department, the 
radioactive material was not stolen in the Ukraine. The 
criminals obtained it from one of the former Soviet republics 
via the territory of Moldova. The criminal group planned to 
sell uranium in a Near East country for $1.2 million. According 
to employees of the investigation group, such an amount of 
enriched uranium is valued at $10 million abroad.

in a most grave condition. Interviewed by RIA, he noted that 
there is no means to pay AES personnel for their work properly 
or to buy fuel, equipment, and spares. In this situation highly 
qualified specialists are defecting en masse to Russia's nuclear 
facilities. All this, (Bronnikov) stressed, puts Ukrainian 
nuclear power engineers in extreme conditions, which is 
impermissible if atomic power stations are to function normally.

  [Text] Vasiliy Kotko, deputy chairman of the State 
Committee for the Use of Nuclear Power, has deemed as 
``catastrophic'' the current situation in the nuclear power 
sector. According to him, there have been no purchases of 
nuclear fuel since the middle of 1993 due to a lack of funds. 
In 1993, the volume of nuclear fuel purchases decreased 
twofold, as compared to 1990. The same reasons hampered the 
dumping of nuclear fuel residue. 
  Kotko points out that the National Control Center of the 
Ukrainian Ministry of Power, the committee's primary and only 
consumer irregularly pays for received nuclear electric power. 
The ministry owes nuclear power stations some 550 billion 
karbovanetses. 
  Kotko underlines that the sector has exhausted its resources 
and if the situation remains unchanged uncontrolled processes 
will begin. If fuel is not bought the industry will be unable 
to function.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jean-Francois Augereau and Jean-Paul Dufour: </F>
``Superphenix Reactor: A Political Choice''] 
  [Text] Following the Nuclear Safety Directorate's 
recommendation on Tuesday [18 January] that the Super-Phoenix 
reactor should be reactivated under certain conditions, the 
debate on the Creys-Malville superbreeder reactor has reentered 
the economic and political arena. 
  By requesting an in-depth reassessment of ``all financial, 
legal, and social aspects of the installation,'' opponents are 
hitting the right target. It no longer is a matter of 
criticizing security alone. Even the danger posed by the fires 
caused by leaked sodium, which were very difficult to control, 
was played down in the expert report. 
  It is now up to the politicians to decide whether or not to 
continue the development of this technology, which, as everybody 
agrees, will not be economically viable for several decades. 
One kW/h produced by the Super-Phoenix prototype is 2.3 times 
more expensive than 1 kW/h generated by a conventional nuclear 
power station. This fact, together with the collapse of the 
uranium market and the freeze in nuclear programs, seems to 
argue against the construction of a superbreeder reactor network. 
  So, should we halt this program for good? This would cost us 
a little fortune, both for decommissioning the reactor and for 
indemnifying France's [foreign] partners. Should we opt, 
instead, to continue this program and try to make a little 
profit out of the installation by having it generate kW/h and 
incinerate small quantities of waste? The latter solution would 
keep the research teams busy and enable us to keep current of 
developments in this technology should it one day become 
econmomically viable. 
  Pending this decision, the reactor operator and the 
political 
authorities are working on the financial figures. Super-Phoenix 
required an investment of 27.7 billion French francs [Fr] 
(current francs), including Fr7.65 billion in intercalated 
interests [interets intercalaires]. Moreover, the superbreeder 
reactor costs more when it is idle (Fr750 to 800 million per 
year) than when it is operating normally (Fr650 million). 
However, this has to be weighed against the political pressure 
emanating from ecological groups, for whom Superphenix has 
become the symbol of the nuclear danger that has to be 
eradicated.

  [Text] Ankara -- Behcet Canturk, one of the prominent 
figures of the Turkish drug and arms smuggling world, was killed 
on Saturday [15 January]. Canturk who was also the sponsor of 
the pro-Kurdish paper ``Ozgur Gundem'' was found dead, along 
with his driver, near the Sapanca district of Sakarya. 
  The examination of the two unidentified bodies, which were 
found on the TEM highway near Kirkpinar, Sapanca, has revealed 
that one of the bodies belonged to Canturk. The other body next 
to Canturk, who was shot once in the mouth, was identified as 
belonging to his driver Recep Kuzucu. There were no identity 
cards on the bodies, which were taken to the mortuary of the 
Sakarya State Hospital where they were identified by their 
relatives. 
  Security officials, who stated that there were many empty 
cartridges in the area where the bodies were found, said that 
investigations were underway. Drawing attention to the fact 
that the conflict among drug smugglers has recently become 
tense, the officials said that the smugglers were settling 
accounts among themselves for reasons which were as yet unknown. 
``The men may have been killed as a result of this power 
struggle,'' the officials added. 
  Born in Lice, Diyarbakir in 1950, Canturk committed his 
first 
murder at the age of 15 when he was a student at a junior high 
school. After serving a prison term of one year, Canturk was 
released under an amnesty of the time. In 1969, during an 
inter- tribe struggle, he murdered another person. Security 
forces were unable to catch him and he committed two more 
murders while at large. 
  When he turned himself in to the police in 1971, he was set 
free again in 1974 in accordance with a further amnesty. 
  Canturk, who was the leader of the Canturk tribe in the town 
of Lice in the province of Diyarbakir, settled in Istanbul in 
1979. He started to deal with arms and drug smuggling from that 
time. Canturk, whose mother and whose second wife were both of 
Armenian origin, was taken into custody following the coup of 
Sept. 12, 1980 and tried in the case publicly referred to as the 
``The Case of the Godfathers.'' The charges were of providing 
financial support to the Armenian terrorist organization, ASALA 
[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia], and to the 
outlawed Kurdish organization Progressive Eastern Cultural Clubs 
(DDKD). The prosecutor demanded capital punishment for Canturk, 
but he was acquitted after a series of hearings. 
  Canturk was also tried at the Diyarbakir Military Court on 
charges of smuggling heroin to European countries by sea. He 
was acquitted due to lack of evidence. 
  In 1991, he started to publish the pro-Kurdish daily Ozgur 
Gundem with Yasar Kaya. Although he was financing the paper, he 
had left the auditing of the paper's accounts to another person 
in line with the company's statutes.

  Joint Statement 
by the President of the Russian Federation and 
the President of the United States 
on Nonproliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction 
and the Means of Their Delivery 
  President Yeltsin and President Clinton, during their 
meeting 
in Moscow on 14 January 1994, agreed that the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and their missile delivery systems 
represents an acute threat to international security in the 
period following the end of the cold war. They declared the 
resolve of their countries to cooperate actively and closely 
with each other, and also with other interested states, for the 
purpose of preventing and reducing this threat. 
  The presidents noted that the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons created a serious threat to the security of all states, 
and expressed their intention to take energetic measures aimed 
at prevention of such proliferation. 
  -- Considering the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons as the basis for efforts to ensure the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, they called for its 
indefinite and unconditional extension at conference of its 
participants in 1995, and they urged that all states that have 
not yet done so accede to this treaty. 
  -- They expressed their resolve to implement effective 
measures to limit and reduce nuclear weapons. In this 
connection, they advocated the most rapid possible entry into 
force of the START I and START II Treaties. 
  -- They agreed to review jointly appropriate ways to 
strengthen security assurances for the states which have 
renounced the possession of nuclear weapons and comply strictly 
with their nonproliferation obligations. 
  -- They expressed their support for the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in its efforts to carry out its 
safeguards responsibilities. They also expressed their 
intention to provide assistance to the agency in the safeguards 
field, including through joint efforts of their relevant 
laboratories to improve safeguards. 
  -- They supported the nuclear suppliers group, and agreed 
with the need for effective implementation of the principle of 
full-scope IAEA safeguards as a condition for nuclear exports 
with the need for export controls on dual-use materials and 
technology in the nuclear field. 
  -- They reaffirmed their countries' commitment to the 
conclusion as soon as possible of an international treaty to 
achieve a comprehensive ban on nuclear test explosions and 
welcomed the decision to begin negotiations at the conference on 
disarmament. They declared their firm intention to provide 
political support for the negotiating process, and appealed to 
other states to refrain from carrying out nuclear explosions 
while these talks are being held. 
  -- They noted that an important contribution to the goal of 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons would be made by a 
verifiable ban on the production of fissile materials for 
nuclear weapons and by the most rapid conclusion of an 
international convention to this effect with the widest possible 
participation of states and on a non-discriminatory basis. 
  -- They agreed to cooperate with each other and also with 
other states to elaborate measures designed to prevent the 
accumulation of excessive stocks of fissile materials and over 
time to reduce such stocks. 
  -- They agreed to establish a joint working group to 
consider: 
  -- including in their voluntary IAEA safeguards offers 
all source and special fissionable materials, excluding only 
those facilities associated with activities having direct 
national security significance; 
  -- steps to ensure the transparency and irreversibility 
of the progress of reduction of nuclear weapons, including the 
possibility of putting a portion of fissionable material under 
IAEA safeguards. Particular attention would be given to 
materials released in the process of nuclear disarmament and 
steps to ensure that these materials would not be used again for 
nuclear weapons. 
  -- The presidents also tasked their experts to study 
options for the long-term disposition of fissile materials, 
particularly of plutonium, taking into account the issues of 
nonproliferation, environmental protection, safety, and 
technical and economic factors. 
  -- They reaffirmed the intention of interested 
organizations of the two countries to complete within a short 
time a joint study of the possibilities of terminating the 
production of weapon-grade plutonium. 
  -- The presidents agreed that reduction of the risk of 
theft or diversion of nuclear materials is a high priority, and 
in this context they noted the usefulness of the September 1993 
agreement to cooperate in improving the system of controls, 
accounting, and physical protection for nuclear materials. They 
attached great significance to further joint work on the 
separate but mutually connected problems of accounting for 
nuclear materials used in the civilian an military fields. 
  Both presidents favored a further increase in the efforts to 
prevent the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. 
  -- As the heads of the countries that have the world's 
largest stockpiles of chemical weapons, they acknowledged 
particular responsibility for eliminating the threat posed by 
these weapons. In this context, they declare their resolute 
support for the convention on the prohibition of chemical 
weapons, and their intention to promote ratification as rapidly 
as possible and entry into force of the convention not later 
than 1995. 
  -- To promote implementation of a comprehensive ban on 
chemical weapons, they welcomed the conclusion of the 
implementing documents for the Wyoming memorandum of 
understanding and agreed to conclude work in as short a time as 
possible on the implementing documents for the bilateral 
agreement on the destruction of chemical weapons. 
  -- The presidents reaffirmed their desire to facilitate the 
safe, secure, timely, and ecologically sound destruction of 
chemical weapons in the Russian federation and the United 
States. The applauded the joint chemical weapons destruction 
work plan recently concluded between the two countries which 
leads the way for the united states to provide additional 30 
million dollars in assistance to support an analytical chemical 
laboratory in Russia to facilitate chemical weapons destruction. 
The United States also agreed to consider appropriate 
additional measures to support Russia's chemical weapons 
destruction programme. 
  -- They reiterated the importance of strict compliance with 
the convention on the prohibition of biological and toxin 
weapons and of continued implementation of measures in 
accordance with the Russian- American-British statement of 
September 1992, which provides inter alia for the visits of 
facilities and meetings between experts in order to ensure 
confidence in the compliance with the convention. 
  -- They supported convening a special conference of the 
states' parties to the convention on the prohibition of 
biological and toxin weapons in order to consider measures that 
would contribute to transparency and thereby confidence in 
compliance with the convention and its effectiveness. 
  The presidents expressed the determination of their 
countries 
to cooperate with each other in preventing the proliferation of 
missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction. 
  -- They welcomed the conclusion of the bilateral memorandum 
of understanding between the Government of the Russian 
Federation an the Government of the United States of America 
signed in September 1993, noted the importance of this agreement 
for ensuring mutually beneficial cooperation between Russia and 
the U.S. in the field of space exploration, and agreed to 
collaborate closely in order to ensure its full and timely 
implementation. 
  -- The U.S. welcomed Russia's intention to join the Missile 
Technology Control Regime [MTCR] and undertook to cooperate with 
Russia in facilitation of its membership at an early date. The 
Russian Federation and the United States of America are certain 
that further improving the MTCR, including the prudent expansion 
of membership, will help reduce the threat of proliferation of 
missiles and missile techologies in the regional context as well. 
  The presidents of the two countries agreed that, in addition 
to strengthening global norms of nonproliferation and working 
out agreements to this effect, close cooperation is essential in 
order to develop policies on nonproliferation applicable to 
specific regions posing the greatest risk of proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. 
  -- They agreed that nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula 
would represent a grave threat to regional and international 
security, and decided that their countries would consult with 
each other on ways to eliminate this danger. They called upon 
the DPRK to honour fully its obligation under the Treaty on the 
Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and its safeguards agreement 
with the IAEA in connection with the treaty, and to resolve the 
problems of safeguards implementation, inter alia, through 
dialogue between IAEA and DPRK. They also urged full and speedy 
implementation of the joint declaration of the ROK and the DPRK 
on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
  -- They support efforts to reach agreement on the 
establishment of a multi-lateral forum to consider measures in 
the field of arms control in nonproliferation that could 
strengthen security in South Asia. They call on India and 
Pakistan to join in the negotiation of and become original 
signatories to the treaty banning nuclear weapons test 
explosions and the proposed convention to ban production of 
fissile materials for nuclear explosives and to refrain from 
deploying ballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of 
mass destruction to each other's territories. 
  -- They agreed that Russia and the U.S., as co-chairs in 
the Middle East peace process, would actively promote progress 
in the activity of the working group for arms control and 
regional security in the Middle East, striving for speedy 
implementation of confidence-building measures and working 
toward turning the Middle East into a region free of weapons of 
mass destruction, where conventional forces would not exceed 
reasonable defense needs. 
  -- They firmly supported the efforts of the UN special 
commission and the IAEA to put into operation a long-term 
monitoring system of the military potential of Iraq, and called 
upon Iraq to comply with all UN Security Council resolutions.

<H3>  Joint Statement on Issues of Export Controls and Policy in 
the Area of Transfers of Conventional Weapons and Dual-Use 
Technologies </H3>
  The secretary of state of the United States of America and 
the minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation 
underscored the staunch commitment of their countries to efforts 
to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to 
enhance global and regional stability. In keeping with the 
spirit of the new strategic partnership between the United 
States and Russia the ministers have agreed on development of 
wide-ranging cooperation in the field of export control. 
Moreover, they have agreed that all necessary steps in this 
field be taken expeditiously, and have established a 
senior-level working group for this purpose, as well as to 
initiate bilateral cooperation in the areas specified in a 
memorandum of intent signed this day in Moscow. 
  The ministers expressed satisfaction with steps taken since 
the last meeting of the President of the United States and the 
president of the Russian Federation to eliminate the vestiges of 
the Cold War, such as the Coordinating Committee for 
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), which according to the 
understanding reached by COCOM members will be terminated not 
later than 31 March 1994. They also welcomed the decision to 
establish a new multilateral regime for enhancing responsibility 
and transparency in the transfers of armaments and sensitive 
dual-use technologies. This new arrangement would not be 
directed against any state or group of states, and would prevent 
the acquisition of such items for military end uses if the 
behavior of a state is or becomes a cause for serious concern as 
determined by the participants of the new multilateral regime. 
  The United States and Russia, as leading exporters of 
conventional weapons, military equipment and dual-use 
technologies, are convinced that additional measures are needed 
on an international basis to increase responsibility, 
transparency and, were appropriate, restraint in this area. 
They expressed their willingness to work with other countries 
in bringing about the early establishment of a new multilateral 
regime in order to achieve these objectives, which would 
supplement existing nonproliferation regimes, in particular 
through arrangements to exchange information for the purpose of 
meaningful consultations.

<F P=106> [Article by Vienna-based correspondent Han Ki-pong: ``No </F>
Progress in the Third Round of the Contact Between North 
Korea-International Atomic Energy Agency''] 
  [Text] The atmosphere in Vienna, where the North 
Korean-IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] negotiations 
over nuclear inspections have been underway for three weeks, is 
considerably different from the optimistic view Washington and 
Seoul have had in early January. Even though the third round of 
the official working- level contact between North Korea and the 
IAEA side was held on 17 January, no ``green light'' was shown, 
as expressed by the IAEA side. It has been learned that, through 
steady contacts in New York at the end of last year, the United 
States and North Korea reached a series of agreements on 
resuming ad hoc [imsi] and ordinary [tongsang] inspections, on 
the announcement of the discontinuation of the Team Spirit, on 
resuming the working-level contact for exchanging the 
North-South special envoys, and on resuming the third round of 
North Korean-U.S. talks. 
  Accordingly, it was expected that the IAEA inspection team 
would be able to enter the North by mid or late January, at the 
latest, without any problems. 
  However, as soon as technical negotiations between North 
Korea and the IAEA started, North Korea began to behave as 
though it had forgotten the political agreement. Such an 
atmosphere makes us believe that the U.S.-North Korean agreement 
attaches more importance to the beginning of the IAEA-North 
Korean negotiations to conduct ad hoc [imsi] and ordinary 
[tongsang] inspections, than to the resumption of full-scale ad 
hoc and ordinary inspections. 
  Actually, it is believed at the IAEA that, because the 
Clinton administration wants to have a diplomatic success, it 
might make ``an early announcement.'' 
  The subjects of the three rounds of the official North 
Korean- IAEA negotiations have been: sounding out mutual 
positions (on 7 January), delivering the IAEA's technical demand 
conditions regarding inspections to North Korea (on 10 January), 
and delivering the North Korean side's position toward the 
IAEA's demand conditions (on 17 January). 
  The IAEA side has kept silent about the concrete contents of 
the negotiations. However, it has been learned that the great 
stumbling blocks to the negotiations are the scope of the 
inspections and technical issues. Among the seven nuclear 
facilities North Korea reported to the IAEA, North Korea has 
felt particularly nervous about the 5-MW Yongbyon experimental 
reactor, which is the most important one in clearing North 
Korea's nuclear suspicion; and a radiochemical laboratory, 
suspected to be a reprocessing facility. North Korea has assumed 
the position that it can receive restricted inspections by just 
allowing the replacement and repair of the existing monitoring 
equipment. North Korea has claimed that this is enough to 
guarantee the continuity of the nuclear safeguards accord. 
  The IAEA holds that the ad hoc inspections are aimed at 
verifying the accuracy and integrity of the reported facilities, 
that there is no alternative but to conduct full-scale and 
unconditional inspections. 
  Along with this, it has been learned that the issue 
concerning the number of inspections has yet to be resolved. 
  Regardless of the level of the political agreement reached 
between the United States and North Korea, it is certain that 
North Korea is once again trying to buy time. 
  North Korea has come to avoid international sanctions by 
beginning negotiations with the IAEA. It seems that North Korea 
is employing a two-pronged policy to leave behind a ``nuclear 
suspicion,'' at the most, during negotiations with the IAEA. 
This is the very strategy North Korea had employed for the past 
year. Whenever North Korea has been driven to a corner, it has 
used a hardline strategy of worsening the situation and 
benefiting from it. For example, when North Korea was faced 
with the pressure of special inspections, it withdrew from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It will be two years in April 
since the nuclear safeguards accord was effectuated. However, 
North Korea has refused to receive even the ad hoc inspection, 
which is the most basic stage of the inspection, not to mention 
special inspections. North Korea has diverted the people's 
focus of attention elsewhere so that they regard even the 
resumption of the ad hoc inspection as progress in the nuclear 
issue. 
  It seems as though North Korea this time thinks it can still 
buy time. The fourth round of the IAEA-North Korean 
negotiations may be held on 19 or 20 January. However, it is 
difficult to expect that North Korea will change its position at 
once. 
  North Korea will probably accept full-scale ad hoc 
inspections at a time when it believes that it can obtain the 
greatest benefit from the third round of the high-level talks 
with the United States. 
  It seems that North Korea has planned it can prevent the 
issue of special inspections from being a key point in the 
agenda at the third round of the high-level talks.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan 18 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are expected to hold a 
fourth round of negotiations on IAEA inspection of North Korean 
nuclear facilities on Wednesday, informed sources said Tuesday. 
  Following a third round of working-level contacts Monday, 
IAEA Operations Director Demetrius Pericos and Yun Ho-jin, a 
councilor at the North Korean Embassy, met unofficially Tuesday 
and agreed to hold a fourth round on Wednesday, the sources said. 
  The successive meetings could mean that the negotiations are 
making rapid progress, IAEA sources said, hinting that there 
could be early inspections. 
  As a result, they said, the two sides could reach an 
agreement this week and the IAEA could start inspecting North 
Korean facilities by 24 January at the earliest. 
  Or the two sides could work out some sort of agreement early 
next week so that an IAEA inspection team could enter North 
Korea by 31 January, the sources said. 
  This optimistic view comes after an official IAEA evaluation 
that there was ``no green signal'' in the third round, but the 
sources described the atmosphere of the talks as good and said 
that the two sides managed to narrow their differences. 
  One IAEA source, who like the others declined to be 
identified, said that both the IAEA and North Korea shared the 
opinion that an IAEA inspection, in whatever the form, has to be 
carried out before the IAEA holds its regular board of governors 
meeting on 21 February. 
  In other words, an IAEA inspection team has to go into North 
Korea in late January or early February in order for the IAEA to 
submit a report to the Board of Governors for it will take at 
least two weeks to inspect facilities and another week to 
prepare the report, the source said. 
  The IAEA Secretariat, which is giving ``political 
significance'' to the February board meeting because it is the 
start of a new fiscal year for the IAEA, wants to get tangible 
evidence to show in the negotiations with North Korea, which 
have been dragging along for more than a year now, the source 
said. 
  The Secretariat also likes to reach a kind of interim point 
with North Korea on inspection ``in consideration'' of the 
United States, which has publicly announced its agreement with 
North Korea. 
  As for North Korea, the IAEA could expect some sort of 
``concession'' from Pyongyang because North Korea, too, has to 
demonstrate a positive attitude toward IAEA inspection in order 
to keep its negotiations with the United States going, the 
source said. 
  Details of the perceived progress being made at IAEA-North 
Korean negotiations are not known. 
  But what is known so far appears to be that the two sides 
have agreed in principle on the need for inspections on seven 
reported facilities, including the radiochemical laboratory and 
the 5-megawatt reactor, the source said. 
  As for differences of opinion on thorny issues such as the 
IAEA request for the collection of materials from the 
facilities, the two sides could discuss them so that another 
inspection team could be dispatched to North Korea later, the 
source said.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan 20 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned North Korea that it will not 
send a team of inspectors unless Pyongyang meets its inspection 
requirements at the seven declared nuclear sites. 
  In a fourth working-level meeting, the UN nuclear watchdog 
agency Wednesday urged North Korea to submit to all inspections 
as stipulated by the nuclear safeguards pact and explained why 
they are required. 
  After the meeting, IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that 
although North Korea had agreed on many items of inspection that 
the IAEA had proposed in a meeting Monday, it still balked at a 
considerable number of items. 
  The IAEA told North Korea clearly that it would push through 
the items it refused to accept, he added. 
  In order for the inspections to be meaningful, North Korea 
has to meet the detailed and reasonable inspection requirements 
of the IAEA, he stressed. 
  The position of the IAEA is that unless North Korea agrees 
on 
all the inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites under 
the nuclear safeguards regime, the IAEA will not send an 
inspection team to North Korea, and this position has been 
clearly conveyed to Pyongyang, he said. 
  The IAEA hopes that North Korea will accept the inspections 
of its declared nuclear sites as requested, Meyer said. 
  Commenting on inspections of two undeclared sites in 
Yongbyon 
that are suspected of being nuclear waste processing facilities, 
he said access to these facilities for additional information 
would be dealt with separately. 
  The IAEA and North Korea will have another working-level 
meeting in Vienna next week, an IAEA source said. 
  North Korea has agreed, in principle, on inspections of its 
seven declared nuclear sites but refused to accept some 
inspection items at two problem sites, a radiochemical 
laboratory and a five-megawatt reactor, such as examination of 
chemical substances used there, other sources said.

  [Text] Berlin, Jan 22 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea have agreed on the basic 
principle of a one-time restricted inspection, and the IAEA is 
expecting an official answer on the sites Pyongyang will open 
for inspection next week, IAEA Spokesman David Kyd said Friday. 
  One-time restricted inspection is neither a regular 
inspection nor a full-fledged inspection, Kyd told YONHAP by 
telephone. The IAEA totally understands the situation and so it 
is not demanding a full scope safeguard inspection. 
  Both sides agree that the purpose of their working-level 
talks is to try to agree on a one-time inspection to see if 
there have been any abnormal changes in the status of North 
Korea's nuclear facilities, but there is a problem on the scope 
of the inspection, Kyd said. 
  The IAEA insists that it should inspect all the facilities, 
and North Korea disagrees. 
  Remarks by a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman 
berating 
the IAEA were just an attempt to shift the blame in case the 
contacts fail to reach an agreement, Kyd said. 
  He said he believed that North Korea would give an official 
answer at a diplomatic level next week, and he is waiting for 
the answer. 
  Making announcements to the outside world and trying to 
reach 
agreement through patient discussions are totally different 
activities, he said, adding that he did not think North Korea 
would break off contact with the IAEA. 
  North Korea may want to say that the IAEA is trying to 
resume 
regular inspections, which had been carried out until last 
year's suspension of nuclear inspection, but that is not true, 
he said. 
  The IAEA has an understanding that the resumption of regular 
inspections should be discussed more. 
  There is no change in the IAEA's position that it will not 
send an inspection team until it has a clear agreement with 
Pyongyang on the scope of the inspection, he added. 
  Also reached by telephone, Yi Si-yong, the South Korean 
ambassador to Vienna, said that there was no change in the 
IAEA's position that North Korea should open all seven declared 
nuclear sites for inspection according to nuclear safeguards 
regulations. 
  Securing continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea and 
carrying out a full-fledged inspection are required by 
resolutions of the IAEA Board of Directors and general meeting, 
and the IAEA Secretariat is not in a position to make 
concessions freely, Yi said.

  [Text] Paris, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- Hans Blix, 
secretary-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), said Sunday that the IAEA will reject a meaningless 
inspection that cannot confirm if North Korea has transferred 
its nuclear materials since the last IAEA inspection in Yongbyon. 
  The North Korean nuclear problem is not only the most 
sensitive issue related to Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
but the most delicate issue politically also, the French daily 
LIBERATION quoted him as saying. 
  If IAEA inspection is always blocked, like in North Korea, 
the problem is very serious, he said. 
  North Korea allowed the IAEA to inspect its seven declared 
nuclear facilities in January last year for the last time before 
it announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty in March. 
  The IAEA is demanding from North Korea the same inspections 
of its seven declared nuclear facilities as conducted last year, 
and is discussing inspection of two additional nuclear 
facilities. 
  The IAEA is also demanding periodic inspections, Blix said. 
  It is certain that North Korea did not declare some 
plutonium 
although it declared that nuclear facilities in Yongbyon 
produced a minimal amount of plutonium, he said. 
  Inspections of the two undeclared nuclear facilities are to 
confirm if they produced plutonium, but the IAEA is still not 
sure if it can find how much plutonium was produced from the 
North Korean nuclear sites. 
  On the question of whether the IAEA can guarantee that North 
Korea is not pushing ahead with military nuclear programs after 
the inspection conditions are met, he said that there are always 
uncertainties. 
  Even if the IAEA does inspect the nuclear reactors in 
Yongbyon, it cannot rule out the existence of secret nuclear 
facilities, he said. 
  He said that the monitoring equipment in North Korean 
nuclear 
facilities has not been operating for several months because 
film and batteries ran out and did not rule out the possibility 
that North Korea extracted nuclear material from the reactors. 
  North Korea has not allowed the IAEA inspection team to 
exchange films and batteries of the monitoring equipment since 
last August.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hans Blix, director general of the </F>
International Atomic Energy Agency, by special correspondent 
Romain Franklin in Vienna; date not given: ``North Korea's 
Nuclear Program -- the IAEA's Headache'' -- first two paragraphs 
are LIBERATION introduction] 
  [Text] International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Official 
Hans Blix explains why Pyongyang's refusal to let inspectors 
check its nuclear sites is a major problem. 
  It has now been a year since North Korea's nuclear ambitions 
sparked a crisis on January 1993, with Pyongyang refusing to let 
IAEA inspectors carry out a ``special inspection'' of two 
nuclear-waste sites. Such an inspection might have provided 
evidence as to the nature of North Korea's nuclear program; 
North Korea is thought to be engaged on a program to manufacture 
nuclear weapons. In March, Pyongyang announced that it was 
withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) which 
it had signed in 1985, then ``suspended'' its withdrawal in 
June, a few hours before it was to become effective. The United 
States has been trying since last Summer to convince North 
Korea's Communist regime to rejoin the NPT and to agree to the 
IAEA's requirements. North Korea recontacted the IAEA last 
week; however, the agency said on Thursday that Pyongyang still 
rejected its requirements. The following is an interview with 
IAEA Executive Director Hans Blix. 
  Franklin: Is North Korea's attitude especially 
problematic for the IAEA as well as with respect to the more 
general issue of nonproliferation? 
  Blix: I would say that this is the most acute and 
politically most sensitive nonproliferation issue we have to 
deal with. The IAEA has been demanding, unsuccessfully so far, 
that a number of inspections which require additional 
information and site visits be carried out, and the case has 
been referred to the Security Council of the United Nations. 
That the inspection process should be paralyzed in such a 
manner is quite a serious matter. 
  Franklin: The CIA says that North Korea could be 
in possession of up to 12 kilograms of plutonium, enough to make 
one or two atom bombs. Is that a fact? 
  Blix: We do not know. The North Koreans have 
declared they have extracted minimal amounts of plutonium (from 
their Yongbyon reactor). However, our inspectors have concluded 
that the amount declared was not the whole picture. This could 
be very serious if the amounts involved are substantial. It 
might be possible to get a better idea of such amounts by 
checking how long the nuclear fuel has been in place in the 
reactor -- whether it has been in place since the initial 
start-up or if it has been changed since. 
  Franklin: What did you hope would come out of the 
inspection of the two sites Pyongyang has made off-limits? 
  Blix: Evidence or confirmation of plutonium 
production there; there is no guarantee that we will be able to 
determine the amount of plutonium produced, however. 
  Franklin: If all IAEA requirements are met, will 
you be in a position to guarantee that North Korea is not 
working on a military nuclear program? 
  Blix: There will always be some uncertainty, all 
the more since inspecting the Yongbyon plant does not in any way 
rule out the existence of other (clandestine) facilities. 
  Franklin: Is it still possible to hide an 
underground nuclear facility from all current detection 
techniques? 
  Blix: That must be no easy task. 
  Franklin: But it is technically feasible? 
  Blix: In Iraq, we looked for an underground 
plant...and even though we did not find one, we remain cautious. 
Never, for any country, do we give a 100-percent guarantee that 
there is no clandestine nuclear program in operation. 
  Franklin: Are the cameras installed by the agency 
on the Yongbyon site still operational? 
  Blix: None of them is as their film supply is now 
exhausted. 
  Franklin: Then, is it possible that fissionable 
materials might have been taken out of the reactor in the 
meantime? 
  Blix: This cannot be ruled out. 
  Franklin: The United States, acting under a UN 
mandate, are currently arranging an agreement which would make 
it possible to reinstate the inspection scheme in North Korea. 
Some people say this agreement is too advantageous for North 
Korea. What are your basic requirements? 
  Blix: We do not intend to carry out any inspection 
that would not be significant, that is, which would not let us 
determine whether fissionable materials have been diverted since 
our previous inspection. The agreement being negotiated would 
be implemented in two phases, at least. First, we ask to be 
allowed to carry out the types of inspections we were performing 
on the seven declared nuclear sites last year. Then we ask for 
a consultation with the North Koreans on the inspection terms 
for the two additional [undeclared] sites. Furthermore, such 
inspections must take place on a regular basis in the future. 
  Franklin: Does fissionable material smuggling 
create a new danger? 
  Blix: This is not a very serious problem. We 
never found any enriched uranium when investigating the cases 
brought to our attention by the media. As for plutonium, the 
amounts involved were minimal. Likewise, we never noted a 
defection by any nuclear scientist from the former USSR's 
military machine. 
  Franklin: What other dangers may arise? Some of 
your colleagues have referred to the atom bomb as becoming a 
``poor man's weapon...'' 
  Blix: More and more developing countries are 
reaching the technological level needed to separate plutonium or 
enriched uranium. There is a definite overall risk, and what 
matters is retaining the political will to curtail it.

<F P=106> [``Nuclear Issue on Korean Peninsula Can Be Solved Only </F>
Through DPRK-U.S. Talks'' -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, Jan 16 (KCNA) -- The nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula is a matter which can be solved only through 
talks between the DPRK and the United States in view of its 
background or its character, says NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula has been raised 
since the United States deployed nuclear weapons in South Korea 
against the DPRK and it has become all the more grave matter 
with continued nuclear threat to the Korean people from the 
ground, sea and sky with South Korea as the largest nuclear 
forward base in the Far East, the paper points out, and 
continues: 
  The United States is the very one who creates nuclear threat 
on the Korean peninsula and the DPRK is the victim who is 
exposed to the nuclear threat for scores of years. 
  The DPRK and the United States are the parties concerned who 
are mainly responsible and have authority to settle the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula. This matter, therefore, can be 
solved through dialogue and negotiations between the United 
States, maker of nuclear threat against us, and the DPRK, a 
victim. 
  At the first round of the talks, both sides discussed and 
agreed on the matters of principle in the solution of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and made public a joint 
statement, and at the second round of the talks, the sides 
discussed practical steps to implement the principles agreed 
upon in the joint statement. Out the third round of the talks 
has been long deadlocked by moves of the Western insound forces 
and their followers. 
  Out of the desire to fundamentally solve on an equal and 
fair 
basis the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, the DPRK side 
put forward a formula of package dealing and has consistently 
made efforts for an agreement at working-level contacts between 
both sides. 
  At the 18th DPRK-U.S. contact held on 29 December last year, 
the sides agreed to discuss in a package deal the issues for a 
fundamental solution of the nuclear problem. 
  The DPRK-U.S. contacts show that the nuclear problem on the 
Korean peninsula can be solved in a fair and peaceful way when 
both sides display the spirit of mutual understanding and 
cooperation. 
  A fair solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula favours the interest of the United States itself. 
  The lesson of the DPRK-U.S. contacts since the second round 
of the talks is that the matter can never be untangled by means 
of resorting to delaying tactics or putting pressure, placing 
unreasonable precondition and, moreover, the threat and hostile 
act infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the partner 
of dialogue will lead the situation to a catastrophe. 
  If the principles already agreed upon between the DPRK and 
the United States are observed and implemented, the nuclear 
problem on the Korean peninsula would be solved fairly.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan 17 (YONHAP) -- Russia signed a contract 
to sell North Korea 10 Golf II class submarines not long after 
it exported four Fox-Trot class submarines to the communist 
country, a senior official of the Russian Pacific Fleet Command 
is quoted as saying in a report by the TOKYO SHIMBUN. 
  North Korea made the deal at its consulate in Nakhodka with 
a 
company that sells submarines it has salvaged from the sea, 
according to the dispatch from Russian fleet headquarters in 
Vladivostok. 
  Although the company has a permit to export submarines under 
the Pacific Fleet's arms reduction plan, it needs formal 
approval from the central government to sell intact submarines. 
  In an abnormal procedure, the submarines are likely to be 
towed by Russian warships to North Korea to escape inspection by 
customs officers, the vernacular Japanese paper said. 
  Once the submarines leave Russian waters, they will be 
handed 
over to North Korean ships for the rest of their journey to 
chongjin, the daily said. 
  The Golf II submarines are similiar to the Fox-Trot types in 
size, but excel them in speed and cruising range and can carry 
three SS-N-5 ballistic missiles. 
  They were sold for $130 dollars a ton, with the total 2,126 
tons selling at $276,000. They were initially for sale to a 
Japanese company, but went to North Korea after the first 
contract was called off, the TOKYO SHIMBUN said. 
  The Russian Navy officially confirmed earlier the sale of 
four Fox-Trot submarines to North Korea, which have reportedly 
been delivered through a Japanese trader. It added that the 
sales were under condition that North Korea use the vessels for 
scrap.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan 17 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry 
expressed concern Monday [17 January] at Russian sales of 
submarines to North Korea lest they be used for something other 
than for scrap. 
  Paek Nak-wan, director-general for European Affairs, met 
with 
Georgiy Toloraya, minister at the Russian Embassy in Seoul, and 
explained South Korea's interest in the matter and requested 
Moscow to disclose the scope of the sale.

express concern that North Korea might try to use the submarines 
for other purposes.''

  [Text] Moscow has notified Seoul that it has made contracts 
to sell 12 decommissioned submarines to Pyongyang and already 
handed over one to the country under the contract, the Foreign 
Ministry said yesterday. 
  Russian Vice Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov met South 
Korean diplomats in Moscow Thursday and told them the vessels 
cannot be restored to submarines as they have been completely 
removed of arms and other equipment. 
  He also said Russia has obliged North Korea to allow 
Russians 
to check, for verification, the disassembling process in the 
contract, the ministry said. 
  ``From these reports from Russia, the decommissioned 
submarines being sold to North Korea are believed to be for use 
as scrap metal,'' said Paek Nak-hwan, director-general for 
European Affairs. 
  When asked by Seoul of its evaluation, Washington also said 
it saw little possibility that North Korea would acquire 
submarine technologies through disassembling the vessels, Paek 
said. 
  U.S. officials said that North Korea might use some of the 
disassembled parts for its other submarines but this also might 
not pose much worries, he said. 
  Paek said the former Soviet Union had handed over two 
decommissioned submarines to South Korea's Samsung in 1989 in 
exchange for some medical equipment. 
  Samsung conducted a close examination but didn't find any 
other use of the vessels but as scrap iron at that time, he said. 
  The former Soviet Union also sold two vessels to Taiwan in 
1991 but China did not raise objections, Paek said. 
  The official said Seoul has demanded an additional 
explanation from Moscow on how it will check the process of 
disjoining the vessels. 
  ``We will continue to closely watch future development of 
the 
Russia-North Korea dealing,'' he said.

<F P=106> [Observer Aleksandr Golts report on interview with Colonel </F>
General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Armed Forces General 
Staff; place and date of interview not given: ```General Staff 
Secret Report' in Fact Blatant Forgery. Chief of Russian 
Federation Armed Forces General Staff Refutes Articles in 
Japanese Weekly and IZVESTIYA''] 
  [Text] The popular Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN has 
published material which, if it were true, would cause an 
international sensation; the respected Russian newspaper 
IZVESTIYA has given a detailed account of this material. Citing 
a secret document from the Russian General Staff and an 
interview with an anonymous staffer from this organization, it 
is reported that Russia is allegedly assisting the 
implementation of North Korea's nuclear missile plans. Also, 
that our nuclear and rocket scientists have helped to develop 
the nuclear weapons [boyepripasy] which, it seems, the DPRK 
already possesses as well as the means to deliver these weapons. 
Moreover, it is claimed that, in the Russian military's 
assessment, the situation is so grave that the issue of 
establishing a joint system of ABM defense for Russia, Japan, 
and the United States needs to be addressed. 
  But it is probably no accident that neither the actual 
magazine nor IZVESTIYA has attempted to ascertain whether this 
document is genuine by making inquiries at its alleged source. 
  In reply to my question as to whether such a document really 
exists, Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Armed 
Forces General Staff, answered: ``The articles in the Japanese 
magazine and IZVESTIYA are based on a gross and obvious forgery. 
It is only to be regretted that such a respected newspaper has 
fallen victim to forgers by publishing this material from its 
Japan correspondent Sergey Agafonov without any preliminary 
verification.'' 
  Indeed, it can only be conjectured why the photograph of the 
first page of the ``document'' was thought sufficient to remove 
all doubts as to the authenticity of the report. After all, it 
is unlikely that IZVESTIYA employs people specializing in the 
clerical work of the Ministry of Defense who would be able to 
distinguish a genuine document from a forgery. People who deal 
with office paperwork, however, are adamant that the Ministry of 
Defense never uses the kind of document serial numbers indicated 
in the article. But if this is the case, the ironic questions in 
the article addressed to the ministry and the General Staff are 
still left hanging in the air. After all, if no leaks took 
place, any hint that there is a little key which ``opens General 
Staff safes for Japanese guests'' is simply an insult. 
  However, other questions are now being raised. In 
particular, what was the point of publishing these unverified 
reports. Col. Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov believes that ``we are 
talking about a clear provocation with the aim of casting 
aspersions on the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff.'' 
Can it be that someone actually wants to rekindle the antiarmy 
campaign of the past few years? 
  At the same time the chief of General Staff is not ruling 
out 
the possibility that this episode has played into the hands of 
those who want to complicate relations between Russia and North 
Korea. 
  Yes, the nuclear problems of the Korean peninsula are 
currently very acute. Russia is not hiding its alarm at the 
fact that the DPRK has suspended its participation in the Treaty 
on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. At the same time, a 
ranking Russian diplomat stated recently, we believe that 
sanctions against the DPRK -- on which some countries are 
insisting -- should be used only as a last resort. But there 
are those who would prefer to replace the complex process of 
negotiations with open pressure on Pyongyang. And is it not 
currently in their interests to make it seem as if Russia is to 
blame for the fact that the DPRK has allegedly acquired nuclear 
weapons?

<F P=106> [Ivan Lamper article: ``Skoda Plzen Denies Arms Contacts </F>
With the Iranian Regime; Documents State Otherwise''] 
  [Text] On Monday 10 January a strange denial was published 
in MLADA FRONTA DNES: ``It is out of the question that Skoda 
Plzen would want to offer Iran the modernized version of the 
T-72 tank.'' This statement was issued by Skoda Plzen spokesman 
Jaroslav Hudec. According to him, he wanted to curb 
``speculation by some of the media about the visit to Iran by 
the Skoda director.'' Until Hudec's statement, however, there 
had been no hint of suspicion in any Czech or foreign newspaper 
that Skoda Director General Lubomir Soudek had offered tanks to 
Tehran. Until now, his trip to Iran has been marked by a 
completely different scandal: A willingness to supply the regime 
with technology for its nuclear program. Why did spokesman 
Hudec decide to deny ``speculation'' that has so far not 
occurred to anyone? 
<H5>  The Deputy Minister and the General </H5>
  The answer is simple. On Friday 7 January RESPEKT asked 
Director General Soudek the following question: ``During your 
visit to Iran at the end of last November, did you hold talks 
with representatives from the Iranian Defense Ministry and 
military experts?'' As Soudek was unable to reply--apparently, 
he was too busy--Jaroslav Hudec dealt with the matter: ``I am 
authorized to state on behalf of the director that, while he was 
in Tehran, he did not hold talks with any of the people you 
mention.'' Three days later, the aforementioned denial was 
issued. Although no specific arms were mentioned in the RESPEKT 
question, Hudec thought it necessary to deny in advance talks 
about T-72 tanks. 
  The two negative statements issued by spokesman Hudec are, 
of 
course, at variance with a document RESPEKT has managed to 
obtain. This is an internal memorandum from the trip to Iran 
prepared for select trading partners of Skoda Plzen after the 
delegation's return home. The following two notes are contained 
in the comprehensive text: 
  A Meeting at the Defense Ministry. 
  Present on the Iranian side: Deputy Minister Vaheed and five 
members of his staff; the deputy foreign minister. 
  We briefed them on the RDP Group and its possibilities. We 
gave them a rough outline, prepared by the RDP Group, of the 
options for supplying our hardware. 
  Interest in: 
  -- the new generation of surface-to-air missiles 
  -- Tamara 
  -- the modernization of tanks. 
  Talks With the Army. 
  Present: General Rahimi, deputy head of tank production. 
  The general is an expert on tanks. It was recommended to: 
  -- send him a list of RDP Group shareholders and their 
military production program (responsible: Engineer Vlcek, 
deadline 31 December 1993) 
  -- invite representatives from the Iranian Army to a 
demonstration of the T-72 and other weapons innovations 
(responsible: Engineer Vlcek, deadline 2/94). 
  On the basis of a demonstration of the hardware, it is 
possible to conclude an agreement on the purchase of weapons or 
on cooperation in the production of weapons systems in 
components. 
<H5>  The Risk: An Unnecessary Fuss in Advance </H5>
  Jan Vlcek, the director general of the Czech RDP Group arms 
consortium, knows nothing about a list of shareholders or about 
inviting Iranian experts, which he is supposed to arrange. ``I 
have not heard anything about this,'' he says. ``We respect the 
law and Czech foreign policy.'' Like Jaroslav Hudec, he also 
describes all the reports about talks between Soudek's team and 
Iranian military officials as ``mere deduction and speculation.'' 
  Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy is more cautious 
in his judgment. In reply to a written question on whether he 
had been informed of Soudek's talks at the Defense Ministry in 
Tehran--either before the visit or after it--he said: ``I am 
only given a brief outline of Mr. Soudek's plans during his 
foreign visits. I was not informed in advance of any specific 
contacts in Iran. I was briefed on his talks only after the 
visit was over.'' 
  And the second question was--what do you think of them? 
  ``During all of these negotiations, the RDP Group management 
exposes itself to the substantial risk that the activities that 
attract unnecessary attention in advance will come up against a 
stumbling block--that the government will not grant a license 
for the anticipated exports.'' 
  There is a slight slip here: In the Czech Republic today it 
is Vladimir Dlouhy's own office and not the government that 
grants licenses for military contracts. According to a cabinet 
resolution of May 1993, it must--at the same time--be guided by 
the point of view of the Foreign Ministry. It, according to its 
spokeswoman, Lucie Pilipova, only considers trade with countries 
under the UN Security Council's embargo to be unequivocally 
prohibited. Despite this, the Cernin Palace apparently also 
``carefully analyzes'' all other requests to export arms and, 
after weighing the situation, gives its consent or rejects them. 
Would the Foreign Ministry now permit the export of tanks and 
missiles to Iran? ``It is impossible to give an unequivocal 
answer to such a hypothetical question that does not concern a 
specific application for a license,'' said Pilipova. ``I think, 
however, that, after taking into consideration all the 
circumstances, our office would be inclined to the view not to 
permit such exports.'' 
<H5>  An Element of Human Nature </H5>
  Jaroslav Hudec has prepared a little show piece for 
reporters 
in connection with the discussion on arms production at Skoda 
Plzen: A copy of the technical design for a saber -- ``until 
now, our last arms order'' -- that Skoda produced 300 of 10 
years ago for the Castle Guard. ``Nevertheless, I would like to 
emphasize one thing,'' says Mr. Hudec apropos of the drawing. 
``Arms production is an element of human nature. It is a fact 
of life and we are realists. We are not ashamed of wanting to 
manufacture special technology. Unfortunately, however, we have 
found ourselves on the defensive.'' 
  It is, of course, hard to determine the true extent of this 
``defensive.'' Skoda Plzen is one of the 40 shareholders in the 
RDP Group arms consortium and, within its framework, it 
coordinates the program for modernizing the Soviet T-72 tank. 
``It should be a truly quality tank,'' said Lubomir Soudek in 
LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE on 29 September last year. ``We will 
modernize it right on the spot based on verified documentation 
from Western firms and tried-and-tested engines. I believe 
there will be a great deal of interest in it. In the near 
future, I will hold talks with the ministers of national defense 
of certain states outside Europe. We have to agree on some 
deliveries.'' 
  Now the Skoda spokesman ``on behalf of Mr. Soudek'' is 
casting doubt on some of the statements made by his director. 
In particular, it is -- apparently -- out of the question that 
our arms producers could agree with anyone on supplies of the 
T-72 ``in the near future.'' The entire modernization process 
is -- regardless of the verified documentation and the 
tried-and-tested engines -- in its infancy. The company has 
only just hired an expert to determine the course of the 
project, to prepare the budget, calculations, and so on. 
Apparently, no one has any details at the moment and nothing 
will be clear for about two years. The situation is the same 
with regard to another of the statements quoted -- 
``modernization on the spot.'' ``So far, we do not know how the 
tank's modernization will proceed,'' Hudec told RESPEKT. ``Mr. 
Soudek's statement was merely an entrepreneurial idea that has 
not yet acquired firm contours.'' 
  Untrue again, at least as far as Jan Vlcek, the head of the 
RDP Group, is concerned. For him it is a fait accompli: 
``Country X will simply place an order for the modernization of 
its tanks and we will go there and carry out the work locally. 
The state where we will carry out the modernization has to be 
-- naturally -- approved by the government.'' 
  There is a problem here, however. Today, there are very few 
countries X that have the ``T-72'' and that, at the same time, 
would meet our conditions for arms exports. The only logical 
customer would be our army. However, the RDP Group management 
itself admits that, so far, it has not managed to conclude a 
contract with it. Therefore, if Vlcek's company wants to adhere 
to our state's political line in its business dealings, its 
stake on the T-72 looks like an inexplicable risk: The markets 
that would be interested are embargoed and those to which the 
tank may be exported do not want the product. 
  According to rival experts from this branch, the answer to 
the riddle lies in the phrase ``modernization on the spot.'' 
Instead of provocative and largely unsuccessful attempts to 
``smuggle'' assembled weapons to terrorist countries, this 
method provides scope for more dignified camouflage: Only parts 
of these weapons, licenses, and the appropriate know-how can be 
exported. 
<H5>  Until the Bear Starts Waving His Arms </H5>
  Of course, tanks and missiles were not the only hot items 
discussed by the Czech businessmen during their visit to Tehran. 
Apart from General Rahimi and Deputy Minister Vaheed (the former 
head of the Iranian intelligence service), the Skoda Plzen 
director also visited Reza Amrollahi from the Iranian Atomic 
Commission. A well-known scandal erupted around these talks 
immediately after the return of Soudek's delegation. 
  ``The Iranian regime is trying to turn Prague into a 
purchasing center for technology, know-how, and materials that 
would be denied it elsewhere in the world,'' wrote the Israeli 
newspaper HA'ARETZ on 5 December and thus provoked an outcry in 
the domestic and foreign media. The most severe reaction came 
from North America. ``According to the U.S. strategic doctrine, 
it is necessary to ward off the risk that Iran will produce a 
nuclear weapon. Germany, after it got its fingers burnt in Iraq 
and Libya, banned the export of nuclear technology to terrorist 
states, but people from executive power are trying to get round 
this ban. And the hungry Czechs want to sell to anyone,'' wrote 
THE NEW YORK TIMES three days before the end of the year. The 
article ended unequivocally: ``If Prague sees its future as a 
merchant of death, it should be told that it cannot bank on 
membership in NATO. If the Russian bear again begins waving his 
arms, whom would the Czechs want to guarantee their security? 
Will it turn to its nuclear customers in Tehran?'' 
  The domestic press mostly limited itself to quoting the 
official statements issued by Skoda Plzen. It admitted that 
negotiations were held on supplying a reactor to Iran, but it 
denied that it acted as an intermediary for Siemens or 
Westinghouse. The mass media, the Skoda Plzen spokesman, and 
some government ministers then repeated several times that 
Skoda's offer concerns ``peaceful technology,'' which can in no 
way be used for the production of nuclear weapons. This 
argument was used recently by MLADA FRONTA DNES on 10 January: 
``To be slightly cynical, selling the Iranians a reactor just 
means a good deal to the tune of tens of millions of korunas. 
It would be hard for the company's management to explain to its 
shareholders that they had left such an opportunity to the 
competition.'' 
<H5>  The Road to Prosperity </H5>
  The uproar over the nuclear reactor is the second time 
recently that the world has tried to scuttle Czech-Iranian 
nuclear cooperation. In June 1993 the secretary at the U.S. 
Embassy in Prague asked the Foreign Ministry to suspend the 
contract to supply technology for extracting and processing 
uranium ore concluded between the Prague company Geoindustria 
GMS and the Iranian Atomic Commission. The Czech side replied 
that it was impossible to turn down the deal because it involved 
``peaceful equipment,'' but in the end -- apparently, thanks to 
voluntary cooperation from the exporter -- the export deal fell 
through. Last year the GMS company even terminated its work on 
a geological survey of the uranium deposits in the Anarak and 
Bandar Abbas regions in Iran. 
  Skoda Plzen, of course, refuses to make similar concessions 
in the nuclear business. The pressure to terminate the contract 
is, according to it, merely an ``unfair move by the 
competition.'' The question of who this competition is remains 
unanswered. In democratic countries today there is no risk of 
being lost in the crush over orders for the Iranian nuclear 
program. The Federal Government (under pressure from the United 
States) prohibited Siemens from undertaking nuclear activity in 
Iran several years ago and the French Framatome company and -- 
of course -- the U.S. Westinghouse company cannot export there 
either. Skoda has also been criticized in the foreign press not 
for reasons of ``competition,'' but on the contrary, because -- 
as an alleged intermediary -- it enables these companies to 
conduct prohibited business deals. 
  At the moment, Iran has a contract with Russia to construct 
a 
nuclear power plant (the VVER [water-moderated water-cooled 
power reactor] type). Russia is also apparently considering 
whether to complete the half-built (and partly bombed) power 
plant in Bushehr that had to be abandoned by Siemens. According 
to Skoda Deputy Director Frantisek Svitak, the Plzen company is 
interested in participating in -- to say the least -- the first 
order as a general supplier via Russia. The point of view of 
the experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency is 
unequivocal: A project of this size will give the Iranians 
considerable experience in reactor engineering and operations. 
It will be essential to train local experts and to permit the 
operation of test reactors that, in the long-term perspective, 
will support the state's nuclear program. Moreover, if Tehran 
obtains the VVER reactor, this will provide it with enough of an 
excuse to submit orders for more nuclear technology. 
  The equally unequivocal point of view of Skoda's senior 
management stands in opposition to all of this. Spokesman 
Jaroslav Hudec formulated it as follows in the December issue of 
the enterprise's magazine SKODOVAK: ``Whether people like it or 
not, our enterprise will not allow itself to be dictated to by 
anyone who feels entitled to do so. We have our own way of 
thinking and our own plans for achieving prosperity.''

<F P=106> [(Sergey Viktorov) commentary] </F>
  [Text] Iran has once again stressed the peaceful nature of 
its nuclear program. [Word indistinct] Reza Amrollahi, official 
representative of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization [IAEO], 
speaking to an IRNA correspondent on Wednesday, said that a 
recent report in the U.S. magazine ``U.S. [word indistinct] 
TODAY'' is sheer lies and (?part of a) U.S. plot against the 
world of Islam. (Sergey Viktorov) writes on this: 
  We should recall that normally information by the special 
services of the United States form the basis of reports such as 
those that are being (?recently heard) in a number of Western 
countries. Taking into consideration the special 
characteristics of U.S.-Iranian relations, it is difficult to 
consider such information to be realistic and unbiased. 
  Nevertheless, according to known facts, in their effort to 
portray the Islamic Republic as a country that has been 
(?rejected) by world society, the U.S. special services are 
willing to ignore conclusions that have been drawn by impartial 
international experts, something which Reza Amrollahi justly 
pointed out in his news conference. 
  Last fall a group of experts from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] inspected all the nuclear installations on 
Iranian territory and did not find any proof that Iran is 
manufacturing nuclear weapons. It should be noted that all 
similar IAEA inspections have so far yielded the same 
conclusion. Moreover, it should be added that Tehran has never 
expressed its intention to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Pact and has also signed the agreement on (?banning) chemical 
weapons. 
  Thus it appeared that the exploitation of this issue could 
be 
stopped. But this did not happen. The United States has 
succeeded in its efforts to convince its partners in the G-7 to 
join in boycotting the exports to Iran of so-called technology 
that can be used for dual purposes. Tehran, which was in a 
technologically unfavorable position, requested assistance from 
Russia and China to complete the construction of incomplete 
nuclear energy installations, and specifically (?agreed) on the 
purchase of two Russian-built nuclear reactors and one Chinese 
nuclear reactor. However, this rekindled a more intense campaign 
in the West regarding Iran's ambitious nuclear programs. 
Russia's assurances were in vain. Russia pointed out that 
Russian-Iranian cooperation in the field of nuclear energy would 
be strictly within the framework of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Pact and under the constant supervision of the IAEA. 
  Of course, the United States wants a more moderate 
government 
to come to power in Tehran. However, the traditional anti-U.S. 
remarks by the current Iranian leaders do not leave any chance 
for a positive change in the situation, and it seems that the 
West will thus continue to exploit the issue of Iran's imaginary 
nuclear threat. 
  One can agree with Reza Amrollahi's remarks in his recent 
interview. However, Tehran's wish to (?link) itself with the 
world of Islam, which can recently be seen, is also reflected in 
these remarks. If one can [word indistinct] speak about a type 
of U.S. plot, it is highly possible that this plot is only 
against Iran. But this plot must be regarded as a confrontation 
between two irreconcilable ideologies.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Shimanskiy report on interview with Valeriy </F>
Tsepkalo, adviser to the chairman of the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet on foreign economic issues -- date not given: ``After 
Ukraine, Belarus Claims its Share of Uranium''] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The Belarusian leadership is concerned 
about the agreement signed in Moscow by Clinton, Yeltsin, and 
Kravchuk. And during the U.S. President's visit to Minsk the 
extremely delicate question of Belarus's share of the materials 
from the elimination of warheads was raised. IZVESTIYA's 
correspondent asked Valeriy Tsepkalo, the chairman of the 
republic Supreme Soviet's adviser on foreign economic questions, 
to comment on this situation. 
  ``The question of the share of the uranium in the tactical 
and strategic nuclear weapons being withdrawn from Belarusian 
territory has been discussed in talks between ourselves and 
Russia,'' Valeriy Tsepkalo explained. 
  ``Moscow and Washington formerly prepared an agreement on 
the 
sale to the United States of the uranium released as a result of 
the elimination of the nuclear warheads on strategic offensive 
weapons. At that time the United States reassured Kazakhstan, 
Belarus, and Ukraine that the agreement would not be signed 
before the question of the distribution of revenue from the sale 
of the uranium was settled. Nevertheless, the United States and 
Russia did sign the agreement. But the United States has 
assured us that the agreement will not come into force until 
agreement is reached on the distribution of the revenue. The 
United States is buying 500 tonnes of uranium over 20 years at a 
cost of $5.5 billion.'' 
  ``The agreement between the United States, Russia, and 
Ukraine contains provisions which establish Ukraine's share of 
uranium sales, either in money or in kind -- that is to say, 
through the delivery of industrial uranium for Ukrainian nuclear 
power stations. And most important of all, Ukraine has 
succeeded in resolving the problem of tactical nuclear weapons; 
in other words Russia has agreed to recognize Ukraine's right to 
the fissionable materials in the tactical weapons and count 
their number when determining the profit from the sale of 
uranium.'' 
  ``For us this is very important. Russia has not recognized 
our right to that quantity of fissionable materials in the 
nuclear weapons withdrawn from Belarus through 27 April 1992. 
But after all, almost half of all the tactical nuclear weapons 
of the former USSR were situated on the republic's territory.'' 
  ``Russia has claimed that the lion's share of the revenue 
from the sale of uranium will go toward covering the expense of 
destroying the weapons. However, this does not correspond to 
reality, since Russia has received considerable sums for these 
very purposes from the United States.'' 
  ``We consider it possible to begin talks with Russia about 
our share of the profits with the mediation of the United States 
-- that is to say, to prepare an agreement similar to the one 
signed in Moscow.''

  [Text] Energy Minister Moshe Shahal has turned down an 
offer from Russia to sell nuclear technology to Israel. The 
minister has just returned from a visit to Russia, which 
included a tour of a nuclear power plant. The minister 
explained why he refused the offer: 
  [Begin Shahal recording] I am not in favor of 
entering or buying existing technology for nuclear power plants. 
I think that Israel and probably the world will have to wait 
many years for a new technology, a safer technology. The 
Russians mentioned that in the past, during the time when 
Professor Yuval Ne'eman was the minister of energy and 
afterwards in a meeting with Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, there were 
talks by the Israeli Government to have a sort of a joint 
venture for a nuclear power plant. I mentioned and I explained 
our policy that we are more interested in the scientific 
question, in cooperation together maybe with Russia and the 
United States, but for future technologies, not the existing 
ones. Basically, I would say the government is not involved in 
buying energy supply as it was some years ago. I explained the 
new structure that we have here. [end recording]

  [Text] Moscow Jan 22 TASS -- The Russian Foreign Ministry 
has denied allegations that Russia has offered to pay its debts 
to South Korea by selling or launching joint production of 
modern arms. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS, Nikolay Solovyov, 
head of the Second Department for Asia of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, on Saturday, said that ``the Russian Foreign Ministry 
did not hand over to the Embassy of South Korea on January 19 
any official documents concerning the selling or joint 
production of missiles, submarines or other modern technologies 
as a form of debt payment for credits.'' 
  The statement followed a publication by the South Korean 
newspaper HANGUK ILBO which quoted sources in the South Korean 
Foreign Ministry as saying that Russia had officially offered to 
pay its debts for Korean credits either by selling its arms or 
launching their joint production. The newspaper also claimed 
that on 19 January the South Korean Embassy in Moscow had been 
presented with a list of military technologies offered by Russia 
for selling or joint production. It said the list had to be 
considered by the Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs and 
Defence. 
  The newspaper said that during his visit to Seoul in August 
1993 Aleksandr Shokhin, who was a Russian vice-prime minister at 
that time, handed over to South Korea a package of proposals on 
military and technical cooperation. Solovyov confirmed this 
information, but added that South Korea has not made an official 
reply yet.

<F P=106> [Editorial: ``A New Nuclear Joke''] </F>
  [Text] During bilateral talks between the two countries in 
Tokyo Monday, India and Japan agreed to work together to bring 
about a non-discriminatory Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. It is 
not yet clear as to which country initiated the proposal but it 
is an even bet that it must have come from our nearest 
neighbours across the Wagah border. Pakistan's stand has always 
been for a regional NPT but what India is now proposing along 
with Japan is an NPT on a world basis. This is, the effect 
India's declaration that if all other countries dismantle their 
nuclear facilities, only then will India agree to do so. As far 
as India is concerned, the present treaty, which expires in 
1995, has been extremely nondiscriminatory in its own behalf. 
After the demise of the Soviet Union as a superpower, the USA 
remains the only superpower in the world which is in a position 
to dictate what the nuclear programme of any country should be. 
In this respect all its dictation has been directed at Pakistan 
which has been asked to cap its programme and then roll it back 
so that this country goes back to square one in the nuclear 
field, despite its repeated protestations that it intends to use 
nuclear power only for peaceful purposes. We have even agreed 
to sign the NPT if India does so at the same time. India's 
response, on the other hand, has been persistently negative. It 
is far ahead of Pakistan, having exploded a nuclear device as 
early as 1974 and the world knows this. This, apparently is not 
where India intends to stop if its latest proposal is examined 
closely. 
  Obviously, India sees no threat to its existence from the 
USA. It lives in mortal terror of its Chinese neighbours and 
trusts Pakistan not one whit and, it repeatedly warns its people 
that an attack from this country can never be ruled out. These 
are the two basic reasons for the present ploy. It stands out 
like a sore thumb that India is endeavouring for an NPT on a 
global basis in order to buy time to stockpile nuclear arms. 
The Indian proposal has been made with a lot of check since the 
attitude of the United States towards its nuclear programme is 
nothing short of an endorsement of whatever India has achieved 
in that field, which is reported to be more than considerable. 
The Indian dread of the Chinese defies comprehension. The late 
Field Marshal Ayub Khan was once asked if he thought China might 
attack India. He pooh poohed the idea with the remark, ``why 
should China do that and end up having to feed India's millions 
when it is hardly in a position to feed its own?'' As for 
Pakistan, the idea is similarly ludicrous. The bania 
[derogatory term for petty traders] is a crafty creature by 
nature who thrives on intrigue. The latest Indo-Japanese 
proposal needs to be shot down in favour of one that calls for 
complete annihilation of nuclear arsenal the world over in one 
fell swoop. In that case there would be no need for an NPT at 
all. The world cannot afford to give India enough time to 
become a nuclear power.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Japan urged India to join 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) to sweep away 
international concern about its development of nuclear weapons, 
Foreign Ministry officials said Monday [17 January]. 
  Japan made the call during bilateral talks in Tokyo on 
nuclear nonproliferation, the second of their kind between the 
two nations, the officials said. 
  Japan is greatly concerned about India's nuclear development 
problem in view of its guidelines on implementing official 
development assistance (ODA), they said. 
  The guidelines require Japan to take into account, when 
extending ODA, the recipient nation's military expenditure and 
development, production, import and export of weapons, missiles 
and mass- destruction weapons. 
  Japan also called on India to accept inspections of certain 
nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) to improve the transparency of its nuclear development 
plans, the officials said. 
  The Indian delegation, pointing out that India's basic 
policy 
is the total abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide, called on 
nuclear power nations to make commitments to abolish nuclear 
weapons by presenting specific schedules, they said. 
  India also told Japan it basically supports the nuclear test 
ban treaty and a treaty to ban production of fissionable 
materials, they said. 
  India will be able to meet Japan's demand to improve 
transparency of its nuclear plans if the treaty to ban 
production of fissionable materials takes effect, the Indian 
delegation was quoted as saying. 
  Also in the talks, Japan pointed out the importance of 
holding multilateral talks to discuss security in Southwest 
Asia, including nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and missiles. 
  India told Japan that if such talks are held, it is 
necessary 
to invite all nations that could influence security in Southwest 
Asia and ensure that all nations shoulder equal obligations, the 
officials said. 
  Touching on India's relations with Pakistan, the Indian 
delegation explained that the ties are still tense despite talks 
between vice foreign ministers of both countries, they said. 
  Japan and India held their first bilateral meeting on 
nuclear 
nonproliferation last March in Delhi. 
  The Japanese and Indian delegations agreed to hold a third 
round of talks this year, the officials said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, 24 Jan -- The Japanese Government expects to 
conclude by March this year outline agreements with three 
republics of the former Soviet Union, excluding Russia, on 
assistance in scrapping the nuclear weapons they have inherited 
after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The ITAR-TASS 
correspondent learned this today at the Japanese Foreign 
Ministry. 
  In the words of a member of the disarmament section at the 
Japanese Foreign Ministry, diplomats from Tokyo are conducting 
talks in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to decide what share 
each of the three republics is to receive of the $100 million 
Japan allocated to the CIS in April 1993 to facilitate the 
scrapping of nuclear weapons and the utilization of radioactive 
waste. 
  The Japanese assistance is to be directed toward 
facilitating 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections at 
military and civilian nuclear facilities in these countries, and 
toward ensuring the safe storage of fissile materials. Specific 
programs will also envisage sending to the spot Japanese 
specialists from nuclear power stations and nuclear waste 
depositories, as well as teaching Japanese experience to local 
staff. 
  Tokyo has decided to expedite the process of drafting 
outline 
agreements in view of the fact that Ukraine and Kazakhstan have 
recently adopted a constructive stand concerning accession to 
the Nuclear Arms Nonproliferation Treaty, and that Kiev has 
guaranteed the withdrawal of this type of weapons from its 
territory.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is looking 
for various ways on getting repaid for loans to the former 
Soviet Union, including material repayment in enriched uranium 
and bunker C oil, an envoy said Tuesday. 
  ``Possibility is not that high at this moment,'' said Kim 
Sok-kyu, South Korean Ambassador to Moscow, ``but we are 
studying these ideas because of the precedent of being repaid in 
aluminum.'' 
  Kim temporarily returned to Seoul last week to brief the 
government on recent developments in Russia and to coordinate 
Seoul's policy toward Moscow. 
  The Paris Club will provide a rough guideline on repayment 
schedule for South Korea, Kim told a press conference, and an 
inter-ministerial discussion with Finance and Trade, Industry 
and Resources Ministries will find various alternatives. 
  Seoul promised 3 billion U.S. dollars in financial aid to 
the 
former communist country but delivered only 1.47 billion dollars 
and suspended the rest at the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
  Seoul has received a list of arms Russia offered for joint 
development and production, another alternative to loan 
repayment, but the government will need prudent review before 
making any decision, said Kim. 
  On North Korea-Russia relations, the envoy said Moscow 
proposed vice minister-level talks to North Korea from this year 
but is yet to receive a reply. 
  ``North Korea and Russia are gradually restoring their 
relations of dialogue,'' he told reporters. 
  Moscow has not abandoned human rights issue with Pyongyang 
and is determined to insert the rights clause for the workers in 
a new agreement on operating North Korean lumber yard, he said. 
  President Boris Yeltsin said he wants his South Korean 
counterpart Kim Yong-sam to make certain to visit Russia this 
year, and the two countries will consult on this issue, he said.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "A Rich Fruit of Reform and Opening </F>
Up -- Congratulating the Start of Commercial Operations by the 
No. 1 Generating Unit of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station"] 
  [Text] The Spring Festival is just around the corner, and 
inspiring good news has come from the Daya Bay nuclear station 
in the south of the motherland: The No. 1 generating unit has 
officially been put into commercial operation, the commissioning 
of the No. 2 generating unit is progressing smoothly, and the 
entire project will be completed and put into operation this 
year. This is an important achievement in the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy and nuclear technology in our country, and is a 
rich fruit of our reform and opening up. It will have an 
important and far-reaching impact, not only on promoting the 
economic prosperity of Guangdong and Hong Kong, but also on the 
further development of nuclear undertakings in our country. 
  The Daya Bay nuclear power station is the product of reform 
and opening up. With the direct concern of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping and the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin 
as its core, the construction of the Daya Bay nuclear power 
station has adhered to the policy of reform and opening up, has 
opened up a new path for making use of foreign funds to build 
large basic industrial projects, and also has made useful 
attempts at the establishment of a modern enterprise system. At 
each crucial moment, leading comrades of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council have given it concern and 
support, and have solved a series of important problems so that 
the entire project could progress smoothly. Local governments 
and departments concerned have done a great deal of work and 
have supported all aspects of the construction of the nuclear 
power plant. The successful construction of the Daya Bay 
nuclear power station is the result of giving play to the 
enthusiasm of the central authorities and of the local 
governments, as well as the result of the concerted efforts of 
all quarters concerned across the country. 
  In the entire course of the construction of the Daya Bay 
nuclear power station, the principles of "quality first and 
safety first" have been adhered to. Over one thousand nuclear 
power specialists and engineering technical personnel from more 
than 20 countries and regions have cooperated closely. The 
plant has absorbed the experience of, and has drawn lessons from 
nuclear power construction projects abroad. It has followed 
international safety standards and codes, and has established 
strict quality supervision and guarantee systems. It also has 
undergone safety assessments and examinations by state and 
international atomic energy organizations and specialists. 
Therefore, the project quality and operational safety of the 
nuclear power station is ensured. 
  Nuclear power is a safe, clean, and economical energy 
source. 
China's energy resources are abundant, but they are not evenly 
distributed. In particular, the comparative shortage of energy 
resources in the economically developed southeast coastal areas 
has constituted a "bottleneck" that is constraining economic 
development. Therefore, while making great efforts to develop 
thermal and hydropower, the appropriate development of nuclear 
power in accordance with local conditions is an important way to 
solve the energy-shortage problem in these areas. At present, 
China has made a good start in developing nuclear power. The 
300,000 kW Qinshan nuclear power station has been operating 
safely and steadily for more than one year and has reached the 
design load factor index two years ahead of schedule. After the 
nos. 1 and 2 generating units of the Daya Bay nuclear power 
station are all completed and put into operation, together with 
the pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations, about 12.6 
billion kWh -- equal to the consumption of about 6 million 
tonnes of coal -- can be generated each year. This will ease 
much of the pressure on long-distance transportation and reduce 
environmental pollution, and the economic results and benefits 
to the society will be rather considerable. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping once explicitly pointed out: "We still 
have to develop nuclear power stations." Through the practice 
of constructing the Daya Bay and Qinshan nuclear power stations, 
we have accumulated experience, trained personnel, and created 
favorable conditions for the development of nuclear power. The 
broad masses of cadres and workers on the nuclear power front 
should seriously sum up experience, make persistent efforts, 
further implement the spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress 
and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider to the 
outside world, and make greater contributions to further the 
development of nuclear undertakings in China [zhua zhu ji yu,

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports published in Seoul vernacular daily newspapers on 2 
February analyzing the statement by a DPRK Foreign Ministry 
spokesman denouncing the United States for `reversing' the 
DPRK-U.S. agreement for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue 
of the Korean peninsula. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 
1,200-word 
article by reporter An Hui-chang, entitled "Background of the 
Statement on Reviewing the Withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT." Noting that U.S.-North Korean 
nuclear negotiations have entered "a new phase" with North 
Korea's publication of a Foreign Ministry statement warning of 
its withdrawal from the NPT, the article analyzes the North 
Korean position as aimed at "strategic purposes." First, North 
Korea wants to promptly secure "substantive fruit" by realizing 
working-level contact with the United States, instead of talks 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, through "a 
strong message" to the United States. Describing the 
substantive fruit as "attaining limited inspection" in 
negotiations with IAEA and suspension of the Team Spirit 
exercise, the article reports that North Korea must have judged 
that it had better use "strong measures" toward the United 
States in a bid to accomplish its goals rather than hoping for 
results from negotiations with the IAEA; and that by using such 
measures, the United States would eventually "make concessions," 
although initially showing "tough reactions." 
  The article cites observations of a National Unification 
Board, NUB, official that although North Korea is "outwardly" 
sternly denouncing the United States, it is maintaining the 
position not to destroy "the frame of negotiation" as long as 
the United States wants to continue dialogue. Basically, by 
releasing the recent statement, North Korea is seeking to 
"resume" negotiations with the United States to discuss the IAEA 
inspections, the Team Spirit issue, and the third round of North 
Korean-U.S. talks; and in this way, wants to "secure" its own 
practical interest. The paper also notes that North Korea 
intends to "consolidate" its internal unity by further creating 
"the atmosphere of tension" with the United States. 
  The liberal TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 5 a 1,300-word 
article by reporter Kim Cha-su entitled "`Attempt to Drag on 
Time' Aimed at Reducing Inspections." Noting the discussion 
between North Korea and IAEA over "the scale of inspection" is 
in the final stage, the article observes that by publishing the 
statement, North Korea is using "delaying strategy" aimed at 
dragging on time in discussions with IAEA because it is not in 
the position of accepting IAEA inspections during Kim Chong-il's 
birthday on 16 February. North Korea also thinks that if 
inspections are conducted before the IAEA Board of Governors 
meeting slated for 21 February, "heated discussions" will take 
place concerning North Korea's "nuclear development suspicion" 
by introducing the results of inspections. 
  The article observes that North Korea is attempting to 
maintain "a favorable position" regarding inspections in 
negotiations with the IAEA by expressing its "tough position" so 
"the scale of inspections" will be reduced "as much as 
possible." The article also points out the possibility that 
North Korea and the United States interpreted the promise of 
acceptance of IAEA inspections "differently." In other words, 
during a 29 December contact in New York, North Korea promised 
that it will accept IAEA inspections in such a way as to "ensure 
continuity of nuclear safeguard measures." The United States, 
however, might have interpreted this as acceptance of 
inspections "to the extent demanded by IAEA." This 
misinterpretation might have touched off North Korea's "tough 
position." 
  Concerning such various observations, relevant government 
officials predict that North Korea's "true intention" will be 
revealed during this week in its reply letter to the IAEA on the 
scope of inspections put forward by the IAEA, which North Korea 
is committed to send "within this week." The article concludes 
that the government views that although it is delaying time in 
negotiations with IAEA, North Korea will accept inspections by 
making "gradual concessions," and thus will not lead the 
situation to a "catastrophe." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word 
article by reporter Chong Pyong-chin entitled "The Government's 
View on North Korean Statement on Withdrawal from NPT." 
Regarding the recent North Korean statement as "a message" to 
the United States, the article observes that North Korea is 
attempting to "upgrade" its position during forthcoming 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks by stressing "the U.S. 
violation of promise" as the main reason for deadlocked North 
Korean-IAEA negotiations. Explaining differences in assertions 
between North Korea and IAEA on the scope of inspections, the 
article reports North Korea seems to wish to solve its problems 
at talks with the United States, instead of talks with IAEA. The 
article observes that there is "no change" in the North Korean 
policy to "settle" the negotiation over the nuclear inspections 
"in any form" before the IAEA's regular Board of Governors 
meeting slated for 21 February. The article refers to some 
observations on the ROK and U.S. side that North Korea will 
likely allow the IAEA inspection team to visit North Korea 
around 16 February -- Kim Chong-il's birthday. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 5 a 
1,200-word article by Yang Sung-hyon analyzing the background of 
the statement by a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
  Describing it as "a message to the United States," the 
article analyzes that the statement has a long-term objective to 
secure an advantageous position in future talks with the United 
States by blaming the United States for breaking a promise, thus 
causing a stalemate in the negotiations with the IAEA. 
  The article notes that "North Korea could not easily accept 
the IAEA's requirements presented in the fourth contact on 17 
January because North Korea had intended to use them as the 
conditions for a package deal in the third round talks with the 
United States." 
  The article speculates that the hard-line moves by the 
United 
States and the ROK, including discounting the meaning of the 
suspension of the Team Spirit exercise and the discussion on the 
deployment of Patriot missiles, may have stimulated North 
Korea's intention to seek a resolution through U.S.-North Korean 
contacts again. 
  The article ends by quoting a government official as saying: 
"It will be difficult for North Korea to secure another contact 
with the United States" due to the firm U.S. stance to side with 
the IAEA. 
  The independent left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on 
page 3 a 1,500-word article by Pak Chong-mun entitled "North 
Korea's Nuclear Statement in the Final Stage, Is It a Tactic or 
Does the North Mean It?" 
  Noting that the statement implies a probability that North 
Korea may depart from a peaceful resolution of the nuclear 
issue, the article reports the Foreign Ministry is gravely 
concerned about the aggravation of the situation, although it 
tries to appear calm. 
  The article analyzes that the Foreign Ministry is not 
optimistic because: "First, if the statement is interpreted as 
North Korea's actual refusal of overall inspection [chonmyon 
sachal], the situation is in a deadlock because the United 
States and the IAEA cannot make any more concessions. Second, 
if the statement is interpreted as aiming at another contact 
with the United States for further reduced scope of inspections, 
there is still little possibility of settlement because the 
United States has no reason to intervene between North Korea and 
the IAEA." 
  The article quotes a Foreign Ministry official as saying: 
"It 
seems that North Korea began negotiations with the IAEA based on 
the optimistic report by the negotiating team with the United 
States, which had apparently only reported the advantageous part 
of the agreement, but now the IAEA's requirements are facing 
strong opposition inside the North." 
  The article ends by reiterating the threat implied by the 
statement to reverse the resolution plan of the nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo February 1 TASS -- Tokyo now has practically 
all main technologies and components to develop its own nuclear 
weapons, since they were developed separately during civilian 
research, two leading Japanese independent experts, Hisashi 
Maeda and Haruo Fujii, [names as received] told ITAR-TASS on 
Tuesday in separate interviews. 
  They virtually confirmed the legitimacy of the conclusions 
drawn by the British Defence Ministry which, according to press 
reports, had warned its government way back last December that 
Tokyo was close to developing a nuclear bomb. 
  Mr. Fujii believes, in particular, that Japan's strategy is 
to distribute the formation of a nuclear potential among 
civilian sectors which raise no suspicions. Under present 
conditions Tokyo has no possibility to "hide" any large research 
expenditure in the state budget without specifying the purpose 
of the research efforts, Mr. Maeda pointed out, for his part. 
  Such a strategy yields certain results because, for example, 
the country's companies have long devised unique explosive 
devices for carrying out complex oil-prospecting operations, the 
devices which may serve already now as finished detonators for a 
nuclear bomb. 
  Of course, substantial technical obstacles still remain in 
the path of the development of a combat nuclear capability. 
However, the main problem, in experts' opinion, still is in 
making a political decision on the establishment of such systems 
in practice. 
  Japan is now obviously not prepared for such a dramatic 
step, 
considering the pacifist sentiments among the public, the 
memories of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the 
constitutional bans, and the government-adopted three 
non-nuclear principles: Not to have, not to produce and not to 
import nuclear weapons. 
  However, Mr. Maeda believes that Tokyo may seriously change 
its stance if it encounters a chain reaction of the proclamation 
of "nuclear sovereignties" by neighbouring countries. Japan is 
extremely worried by sufficiently reliable reports about North 
Korea's feverish nuclear efforts. There are suspicions that 
Seoul may also embark upon the same road if it fails to contain 
the military threat from Phyongyang by other means. 
  Mr. Maeda is of the opinion that Japan can well become a 
third "new nuclear power of the region" after South Korea, 
although, in his view, Tokyo would hardly make such a decision 
easily.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 1 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
Tuesday [1 February] brushed aside a reported move toward the 
possession of nuclear weapons and renewed a commitment to its 
long-held nonnuclear policy. 
  "Our country has been maintaining three nonnuclear 
principles 
and our use of nuclear energy is limited to peaceful purposes," 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference. 
  "It is impossible for us to develop nuclear weapons," the 
top 
government spokesman said. 
  Japan has long adhered to a policy of not possessing or 
producing nuclear weapons or allowing them into Japan. 
  Takemura's comment was intended to refute reports by a 
British newspaper that Tokyo might alter its nonnuclear policy 
and opt to possess nuclear weapons. 
  The SUNDAY TIMES reported Sunday that Britain's Defense 
Ministry has warned Prime Minister John Major that North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons development program may compel Japan 
to give up its nonnuclear policy. 
  Takemura said the British Government has acknowledged it has 
no reason to doubt Japan's nonnuclear stand. 
  He also denied a report carried Monday by another British 
paper, the independent, that Tokyo plans to develop 
intercontinental ballistic missiles in connection with its 
imminent launching of the first all-Japanese satellite-launch 
rocket. 
  "I want to emphasize our nation's space development 
activities are strictly limited to peaceful purposes," Takemura 
noted.

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 6 KYODO -- Japan will scale down its 
extraction of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel, power industry 
sources said Sunday [6 February]. 
  The new measures are contained in a long-term plan for the 
development and use of nuclear energy being prepared by the 
Atomic Energy Commission, the sources said. 
  Under the plan, the industry will also embark on long-term 
storage of large amounts of spent fuel on site at nuclear power 
stations, the sources said. 
  They said the commission has decided to introduce sweeping 
changes in the fuel recycling system, a main pillar of Japan's 
energy policy, because of international disapproval over 
increased use of plutonium. 
  The sources said the commissioning of a second recycling 
plant planned in addition to one being built by the Japan 
Nuclear Fuel Ltd. at the village of Rokkasho in Aomori 
Prefecture will now be delayed by about 20 years from around 
2010 until 2030. 
  The timing of a third recycling plant would be decided 
around 
2010, they said. 
  Delaying the commissioning of the second plant until 2030 
will not affect demand for a plentiful supply of plutonium for a 
fast breeder reactor expected to be operational by that time, 
the sources said. 
  The plant now under construction at Rokkasho is designed to 
handle 800 tons of uranium annually, but spent fuel from the 
nation's power plants annually exceeds this amount and is 
expected to reach around 1,600 tons by 2010. 
  With the postponement of the second plant, Japan's 
reprocessing capacity will be significantly less than the supply 
of spent fuel. 
  The sources said this will necessitate long-term storage of 
spent fuel that cannot be processed at the Rokkasho site. 
  Due to the consequent shortage of storage space at nuclear 
facilities, the revised plan suggests that space be sought 
outside the facilities and that existing space be expanded, the 
sources said. 
  Japan's plutonium policy has been a subject in the United 
States Congress. 
  President Bill Clinton has expressed understanding of the 
policy, but has also written to congressional opponents of 
plutonium use to say he shares their opinion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 31 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the DRPK made public a statement today in 
connection with the fact that the United States is reversing the 
agreement between the DPRK and the United States for a peaceful 
solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. 
  The United States has gone the length of imposing a deadline 
and issued an ultimatum that it will not agree to hold a third 
round of the DPRK-USA talks, unless the DPRK accepts the IAEA 
demand, the statement said, and went on: 
  The United States plans to defiantly go ahead with its 
large- 
scale nuclear war exercises against the DPRK, including the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises and is pressing ahead on 
a full scale with the deployment of the "Patriot" missiles in 
South Korea. 
  All the facts clearly show that the United States has no 
intention at all to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula peacefully but still remains unchanged as ever in its 
ulterior objectives to strangle the DPRK by force at any cost. 
  With regard to the current crisis due to the despicable and 
dangerous actions of perfidy on the part of the United States, 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea solemnly declares its position as follows: 
  First, if the United States defiantly goes ahead and 
reverses 
the promise it has made to the DPRK, the DPRK will no longer be 
bound by the promise it has made to the United States. 
  The DPRK's promise to the United States includes all the 
goodwill measures and commitments it has taken so far 
unilaterally for the continued DPRK-USA talks and for a peaceful 
resolution of the nuclear issue, such as the suspension of the 
effectuation of its announced withdrawal from the treaty on the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the freeze of all the 
nuclear activities, and the declared intention to renounce the 
graphite-moderated reactor system. 
  Second, if the United States has no intention to hold any 
further round of talks, the DPRK, too, will have no intention to 
do so. 
  It will be a gross miscalculation, if the United States 
considers the DPRK-USA talks as an offering to the DPRK. 
  The DPRK has consistently called for negotiations with the 
United States since the first days of the origination of the 
nuclear issue, in order to peacefully resolve the issue, not to 
seek any benefit from the United States. 
  We have so far lived on our own without any relations with 
the United States, we can live well on our own in the future, 
too, and we have become constitutionally adapted to such life. 
  Third, if the United States decides to take other options, 
we 
will also take our own counter measures. 
  In no way does the right of choice belong to big countries 
only. 
  The U.S. hardliners and conservatives must be held totally 
responsible for the catastrophic consequences arising therefrom, 
and the South Korean authorities, indiscreetly following their 
lead, can never extricate themselves from this responsibility.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Warns Against Japan's </F>
Nuclear Armament That Has Reached a Dangerous Phase" -- KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, February 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement today regarding Japan's 
design to produce nuclear weapons by securing plutonium by 
itself. 
  The statement says: 
  According to reports, Japan will soon ignite monju, its 
first 
fast breeder reactor. This is an undisguised attempt of Japan 
to secure quantities of plutonium by itself and produce nuclear 
weapons any moment. 
  The annual capacity of the reprocessing plant of Japan is 
800 
tons, the biggest in the world. When it goes into full 
operation by the end of the present century, Japan will rank 
third in the world in reprocessing capacity after the United 
States and France. 
  Even according to data released by the Japan science and 
technology agency, it has already stockpiled 1.6 tons of 
plutonium at home and 2.9 tons abroad and will possess 50 tons 
of plutonium at all times by 2010, an amount enough to make more 
than 6,200 nuclear bombs. 
  Japan has already developed not only electronic detonating 
device and other elements for the manufacture of nuclear bombs 
and their technologies but also long-range means of nuclear 
delivery that can be used as intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
  Facts tell that Japan's nuclear armament now has reached a 
dangerous phase. 
  In view of the tense situation in which Japan's nuclear 
armament is being stepped up around the Korean peninsula in real 
earnest, we cannot but follow such developments with vigilance. 
  Japan's stepped-up nuclear armament means creating an 
obstacle to the process of denuclearization on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Denuclearization of Northeast Asia must be realized if peace 
and security free from nuclear weapons are to be guaranteed 
substantially in this region including the Korean peninsula. To 
this end, not only Asia but the rest of the world should pay due 
attention to Japan which is capable of possessing nuclear 
weapons and moving in that direction. 
  Denuclearization of Northeast Asia should lead to a total 
elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and editorials from ROK vernacular newspapers published 
on 8 February on the U.S. order to prepare for the Team Spirit 
military exercise and the DPRK nuclear issue. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 2 a 
900-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong 
Chin-sok analyzing the background of the order to prepare for 
the Team Spirit exercise. 
  The article interprets the order to prepare for the Team 
Spirit exercise as a realization that "the negotiations on the 
North Korean nuclear issue have actually ruptured" and explains 
that the order serves as an ultimatum to North Korea. 
  The article reports "the United States is most concerned 
about the possibility that North Korea may declare itself a 
nuclear possessing country because this would automatically 
exempt North Korea from the obligation to accept nuclear 
inspections, and as a result, sanctions by the UN Security 
Council would not be as easy." 
  The article quotes Dr. (Spector) of the Carnegie Endowment 
for International Peace: "There is no clue that could prove 
North Korea is a nonnuclear country." 
  The article forecasts that the U.S. Government will look to 
"a final settlement at the edge of the cliff" by not announcing 
the detailed schedule of the Team Spirit exercise for the time 
being. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 an 
800- word editorial criticizing the use of the Team Spirit 
exercise as a negotiating card. 
  The editorial asserts that the "purely defensive" Team 
Spirit 
exercise is "inevitable" and "natural" under the current defense 
system of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces and that it was not 
appropriate to use the exercise in the negotiations in the first 
place. 
  The editorial asserts that if the exercise had not been used 
as a negotiating card so easily, we might not have been blamed 
for evoking the tension first by resuming the preparations for 
the joint military exercise after saying it was possible to 
suspend the exercise. 
  The editorial asserts there is no guarantee that North Korea 
would give up nuclear development even if all its conditions are 
met because in the past North Korea has always added new 
conditions after concessions have been made. 
  The editorial continues that in dealing with such a 
sensitive 
issue, it should be made clear what concessions we are able to 
make, and the advantages and disadvantages of giving up or 
insisting on nuclear development. 
  The editorial reports that while continuing dialogue 
efforts, 
we should make full preparations for the people's safety and the 
right of existence and urge the government to show, thorough its 
security posture, its clear position toward the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 
1,000- word article by Washington-based correspondent Chin 
Chang-uk. 
  The article notes that even though the hard-line moves of 
the 
United States -- including U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's 
remarks regarding the use of sticks after carrots, the 
resumption of the Team Spirit exercise, deployment of Patriot 
missiles and Apache helicopters, and disclosure of the five-step 
operation plan -- may lead to a crisis scenario, analysts of 
Korean affairs in Washington are optimistic. 
  The article reports that the analysts assert that North 
Korea 
will eventually accept all the inspection conditions of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and that North Korea is 
dreaming if it thinks a war is inevitable under its current 
military preparedness. The article reports that the analysts 
think North Korea is not at all prepared for a large-scale war 
based on the fact that "there is a serious food shortage in 
North Korea, there has been no signs that it has made any 
efforts to secure more military provisions, and that North Korea 
has only a two-month energy reserve with its existing energy 
storage facilities." 
  The article cites another assertion that because North Korea 
is more afraid of the counterattack by ROK-U.S. Combined Forces, 
war will not breakout on the Korean peninsula as long as North 
Korea does not lose its reason. 
  The article concludes with concern by pessimistic analysts 
about the possibility that the United States might lose its 
reason after the humiliating results of the negotiations with 
North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 4 (YONHAP) -- A senior government 
official, concerned over doubts about Korea-U.S. ties aroused by 
Washington's reported pressure on Seoul to buy Patriot missiles, 
said on Friday there is no change in their basic relations. 
  Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said no decision has 
been made on deployment of the anti-missile missiles in Korea, 
though negotiations are under way between the two countries. 
  "I understand that the U.S. Government has not yet made a 
final decision on whether the U.S. forces in Korea should be 
equipped with Patriot missiles," he said. "I think the missiles 
will be deployed after Seoul and Washington reach agreement on 
the number of missiles and the date of deployment, considering 
any possible developments in the situation related to North 
Korea's nuclear weapons program." 
  Washington has not pressured Seoul to buy U.S. weapons, the 
official said, commenting on local press reports that the 
Pentagon has asked Korea to buy airborne self-protection jammers 
for the Korean fighter program. 
  A letter reportedly sent by U.S. Defense Secretary-nominee 
William J. Perry to Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae asking Korea 
to buy jammers for the Korean Air Force's F-16 fighters was not 
meant to apply pressure, but to advise that production of the 
jammers has been suspended due to problems with the weapon, he 
said. 
  Only some of the 120 F-16 fighters Korea is to import will 
be 
equipped with the existing model of jammers and the rest with a 
modified new model, he said, adding that the United States has 
not given up the airborne self-protection jammer project despite 
suspending production. 
  "Nobody knows at the moment whether North Korea will allow 
the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its nuclear 
facilities," the official said, "and the government does not 
want the North Korean nuclear issue to go to the UN Security 
Council and thus to heighten tensions on the Korean peninsula." 
  "There is no discord between Seoul and Washington over the 
North Korean nuclear issue and the two governments are 
maintaining close cooperation." 
  The opposition Democratic Party is angry about the U.S. 
Government's reported pressure on Korea to buy the jammers. 
  In a statement issued on Friday, party spokesman Pak Chi-won 
said, "I feel indignation at U.S. Defense Secretary-nominee 
William Perry's pressure for Korea to buy defective radar 
jammers through channels outside the usual ones in weapons trade 
between the two countries. The government should make public 
this pressure and seek a new diplomatic approach toward the 
United States, defying such pressure." 
  Perry's letter to Defense Minister Yi will damage the two 
nations' traditional friendship, he said, urging the U.S. 
Government to reflect on whether the letter is tantamount to 
regarding Korea as a disposal site for defective weapons. 
  Washington should "apologize for the letter," he added.

  [Text] Artillery and infantry fighting in the area of 
Kiseljak and Kresevo and in the vicinity of Novi Travnik 
intensified this morning. Infantry clashes were most intense 
around Kresevo where last night the HVO [Croatian Defense 
Council] repelled a powerful infantry attack by Muslim forces, 
inflicting huge losses on the attackers. 
  This morning Muslim artillery has pounded villages around 
Kiseljak. Civilians were wounded in the village of Lepenica but 
no exact casuality figures are yet available. 
  Novi Travnik and the surrounding villages, especially the 
village of Rastoci and Relej hill, again came under artillery 
and mortar attacks from the Muslim army. HVO military sources 
have said that in these attacks the Muslim army has been using 
shells filled with chlorine-based toxic gases. 
  At 0800 this morning a general alert was sounded in Mostar 
again. In mortar attacks by Muslims on the western part of 
Mostar [Croat- held] yesterday and throughout the night four 
civilians were wounded.

  [Text] Prague -- The promotion and advertising of arms, as 
well as their sales, can be conducted, according to the new law, 
only by licensed arms dealers. To date, any businessman with a 
general enterprise license could offer arms and military 
technology for sale. 
  Bretislav Gregr, director of the License Administration at 
the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said that the tightening of 
the conditions was caused by instances that unnecessarily 
damaged the reputation of the republic. He gave an example of a 
citizen who had nothing to do with arms dealing advertising the 
sale of handguns and submachine guns in a foreign journal. Some 
people even offered tanks and airplanes abroad. "We have begun 
to receive notes through diplomatic channels asking how it is 
possible that these individuals can offer arms without any 
restrictions," Gregr said.

  [Text] Brasilia, 9 Feb (AFP-NA) -- After introducing a 
controversial amendment, the Brazilian Senate today gave final 
approval to a quadripartite agreement with Argentina, the IAEA 
(International Atomic Energy Agency), and the ABAC 
(Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of 
Nuclear Material). 
  The document was approved after inclusion of the 
supplemental 
adjustments [ajustes subsidiarios] that already had been 
negotiated by Itamaraty and IAEA, which were imposed by senators 
who even threatened to reject the project. 
  The adjustments will preserve Brazilian technological 
secrets, but will permit special ABAC and IAEA inspections of 
any nuclear materials produced by Brazil. 
  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who was fully satisfied with 
the agreement, will be able to travel to Bonn -- he will leave 
on 21 February on an official visit to Germany -- without 
fearing that his interlocutors may threaten to adopt retaliatory 
measures, which would have been likely had Brazil failed to 
ratify the agreement. 
  A report indicated that ABAC is making an inventory of 
Argentine and Brazilian nuclear facilities and materials, and 
the IAEA will make an inspection in the two countries within the 
next 60 days. 
  For Brazil, the ratification was something totally new 
because the country had never ratified a nuclear safeguard 
agreement. 
  The quadripartite agreement is broader than the Tlatelolco 
Treaty, which includes all Latin American countries. The voting 
on the ratification of this treaty had been postponed (perhaps 
for today or a date after Carnival). 
  Today's debate, which lasted more than two hours, developed 
after a Senate request for an amendment, which was finally 
approved and establishes that "all changes to supplemental 
adjustments will be approved by Congress."

  [Article by Fatima Belchior from Rio de Janeiro] 
[Text] The overall entrepreneurial complex created in the 1970's 
to support the Brazilian nuclear program -- Nuclebras [Brazilian 
Nuclear Corporations, Inc.], six subsidiaries, and a fuel 
element plant -- are undergoing one more reorganization. Nuclear 
Industries of Brazil [INB], which in 1988 replaced Nuclebras and 
lost some of its original functions, is dismantling three 
subsidiaries: the Brazilian Uranium Co., Nuclemon Mining and 
Chemicals Ltd., and Nuclei [Nuclebras Isotope Enrichment, Inc.]. 
  INB President Roberto da Franca on 26 January said: "We are 
readjusting the industry to its real needs." He added that by 
transforming the three subsidiaries into departments, the 
company will save $1.27 million per year. The number of INB 
board members (directors and advisers) will decrease from 43 to 
14, while the the number of management employees will decrease 
from 83 to 56. 
  The Nuclebras system was created in 1975, one year after the 
Brazilian-German Agreement was signed to support the activities 
of eight nuclear plants. So far, Brazil has only one plant, 
Angra-1, which was not a result of the agreement signed with the 
Germans and normally operates at half its capacity. In addition 
to that, the completion of Angra-2's construction is not 
entirely ensured. Angra-2 will be the first plant to use German 
technology (Angra-1 was negotiated with U.S. Westinghouse). As a 
result, the overall system has no clients for its products: 
uranium, enriched uranium, and fuel elements. 
  Activities linked to the nuclear program have been 
decreasing 
slowly although the idea to build eight nuclear plants was 
discarded a long time ago. In 1986, two years before being 
transformed into the INB, Nuclebras and its subsidiaries had 
almost 6,000 employees. Currently there are 1,200. This number 
probably will decrease as a result of the changes being 
implemented by the INB. So far, Franca has not mentioned 
dismissals. He prefers to talk about reappointment, particularly 
in the experts' area, through accords being signed with Furnas 
[Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc.] and the National Nuclear 
Energy Commission (CNEN), to which the INB is linked. 
  Originally, Nuclebras worked with the following 
subsidiaries: 
Nuclemon [Nuclebras Monazite and Associated Elements, Ltd.] 
(monazite sand exploitation), Nuclam [Nuclebras Mining 
Assistance, Inc.] (uranium prospecting), Nuclen [Nuclebras 
Engineering, Inc.] (nuclear plant engineering), Nucom [Nuclebras 
Nuclear Plant Construction, Inc.] (nuclear plants construction), 
Nuclep [Nuclebras Heavy Equipment, Inc.] (nuclear plants heavy 
equipment), and Nuclei (uranium enrichment). Nuclebras also was 
linked to the Fuel Elements Plant (FEC). 
  Currently, Nuclen belongs to Eletrobras [Brazilian Electric 
Power Company, Inc.] and Nuclep has been included in the 
privatization program. Nuclam and Nucom already have been 
dismantled and will be followed by Nuclemon, Uranium of Brazil 
(which was established together with the INB), and Nuclei. 
According to Franca, the overall complex will now operate with a 
president and four directors. 
  Nuclei, which was built in Resende to enrich uranium through 
the jet nozzle process, was not successful. Franca added that 
the Brazilian Government has chosen to adopt the 
ultracentrifugation process developed by the Navy Special 
Projects Coordinating Board (Copesp). This is why the company is 
being dismantled and the personnel being absorbed by the INB. 
  Uranium of Brazil, which was established to produce uranium 
and its concentrate, was out of operation for four years due to 
lack of demand on the domestic and international markets. The 
product could not be exported in view of its very low price. 
Nearly $8 million would have to be invested in Nuclemon to make 
the installation of a chemical plant to extract chloride [not 
further identified] from rare types of sands feasible. 
<H5>  Waiting for Angra-2 </H5>
  The INB has a $40 million yearly budget resulting from the 
sale to Furnas, which operates Angra-1, of fuel produced in its 
Resende plant. With these resources, the company covers 50 
percent of its expenses. The rest is supplied by the central 
government. 
  Franca believes that when Angra-2 goes into operation the 
company will have the required conditions to become 
self-sufficient because then it will have one more customer for 
its fuel element. "Angra-2 is vital to the INB complex because 
it will ensure that uranium exploitation will continue, the FEC 
remains in operation, and we will achieve more technological 
knowledge," Franca said. 
  INB investments for 1994 are not very significant: Franca 
plans to have from $2 million to $3 million to invest in new 
machinery for the FEC and to adapt Nuclei (where the process of 
enriching uranium through a jet nozzle was developed) for the 
production of pills [pastilhas], which are a component of the 
fuel element. Currently, these pills are only produced abroad. 
  There are more ambitious plans: to sell FEC components to 
Siemens (German) reactors, which must be qualified abroad; to 
rent Uranium of Brazil facilities to the private sector; and 
several other initiatives.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: </F>
"Difficulties Ahead"] 
  [Text] The Foreign Ministry has an almost impossible task 
ahead: to defend Brazilian interests without the cooperation of 
the Senate, which has been making decisions affecting foreign 
policy. In an interdependent world -- regardless of whether we 
agree with it -- many domestic policy decisions end up becoming 
part of a conflict with other nations, which are sometimes more 
powerful than Brazil and can impose conditions during a 
negotiating process. 
  The Senate is currently debating two items that have a 
strong 
effect on our relations with the United States: 
  1. The approval of agreements between Brazil and Argentina 
and the quadripartite agreement between Brazil, Argentina, the 
nuclear agency created by both governments, and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency -- all related to the 
international supervision of the Brazilian nuclear program -- 
and; 
  2. the approval of the law on patents. 
  The delay in approving the agreements has produced all kinds 
of negative effects. Now only a very swift and expeditious 
Foreign Ministry action will be able to make the members of the 
select nuclear club believe that Brazil does not have a second 
purpose in developing its nuclear program. The damage produced 
by the delay in approving those agreements affects the image of 
Brazilian diplomacy, and wears out our relations with the 
nuclear club, but it does not produce immediate damage to the 
country's economic interests. The delay in voting on the 
intellectual property law has doubly negative effects, as it 
affects the image of the country's diplomacy and hurts it 
economically. 
  The Senate seems incapable of realizing that the U.S. 
Government -- following U.S. domestic laws and subject, without 
the shadow of a doubt, to reasonable pressures -- has designated 
the month of February for verifying whether or not the 
legislation on intellectual property rights in Brazil 
contemplates certain requirements. If the answer is negative, 
that country will apply sanctions on Brazilian exports. The 
problem for the Brazilian Foreign Ministry -- which at the 
beginning of the month will send the Foreign Ministry secretary 
general to Washington to attempt, once more, to postpone a 
judgment on the question -- is that the U.S. position is 
sometimes so oblivious to reality that it is comparable to that 
of some Brazilian industrial groups. 
  These national groups are blind to the fact that the economy 
today has a global scope, and that all states do not have equal 
power. On the contrary, the new scope accentuates the 
differences between states. The Americans, on their part, 
appear to be virtually blindfolded in that they fail to realize 
that the Brazilian Government also suffers pressures, and must 
also take the national interests it represents into account. 
  What is important to bear in mind, for as long as the 
Americans do not make a decision, is that the Senate must act if 
it wants to influence foreign policies. You cannot support old 
rhetoric and simply refuse to vote on items that are important 
for our foreign affairs agenda. You cannot implement policies, 
much less foreign policies, by omission -- particularly when on 
the other side of the table is a party that wants action, and 
can demand it by applying sanctions.

<F P=106> [Interviews with officials following nuclear reactor </F>
dedication, by M.B. and A.B.; place and date not given] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  Mr. Li Dingfan, Head of the Chinese Delegation: `A Sound 
Base for Scientific Development in Algeria' </H3>
  Vice-minister of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Li 
Dingfan is also vice-president of the Chinese Atomic Energy 
Agency and a university professor. In addition to his functions, 
he was heading the Chinese delegation that helped build the Es 
Salem reactor. He kindly answered our questions on this project, 
which constitutes a symbol of Algerian-Chinese friendship. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: How would you evaluate this project? 
  Dingfan: Today is a joyful day for everybody. It 
is an important page in Chinese-Algerian collaboration. It is 
memorable. I expressed this in writing in the visitors' book. I 
hope that this blossom of nuclear science and technology, grown 
by the Algerian and Chinese parties, will bear fruit as soon as 
possible. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: What does this project mean to you? 
  Dingfan: It is the living symbol of cooperation in 
development through energy. At least, it is a sound base for 
scientific development in Algeria. We may say that it boosts the 
Algerian people's reputation throughout the world. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: Will the Algerian-Chinese 
cooperation in the nuclear sector continue? 
  Dingfan: If there is a desire for cooperation, 
there is no doubt that we shall be available and present. We 
have been collaborating for six years. 
  I hope that Algeria will be able to continue its development 
peaceably and peacefully. I wish that the people may enjoy the 
benefits of this reactor. 
<H3>  Mr. Abdellah Laid (Doctor in Nuclear Physics): 
`Possibilities for Serious Work' </H3>
  Being a researcher at Ain-Oussera is not a pleasure; it is a 
passion which, alone, makes it possible to overcome all 
problems. Mr. Abdellah Laid is head of research at the physics 
department. He talked to us about it. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: How important would you say this 
reactor is? 
  Laid: It is very important for the future of the 
nuclear sector in Algeria. The entire nuclear sector will be 
concentrated around this site. The reactor design will allow the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy. For instance, we will be able to 
dope selenium, to produce radioisotopes, which are very 
important in Algeria for nuclear medicine and for the industry. 
Studies and surveys of manufacturers and hospitals throughout 
the country have shown that there is a large demand for 
radioisotopes. This reactor being equipped with irradiation 
channels, we can produce these radioisotopes for medicine and 
the industry. For research and agriculture, some radioisotopes 
are currently used in small amounts, but we can supply more now 
that we have this reactor. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: Could you tell me where you studied? 
  Laid: I have a doctorate in nuclear physics. I 
studied my specialty in England for a few years. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: Have you received offers to work in 
other countries? 
  Laid: Yes, but I preferred living in my country. 
It is very important for us. Especially considering that, this 
time, things are taken seriously and we have the possibility of 
doing serious work. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: Could you tell us how much you get 
paid? 
  Laid: I cannot tell you. But it is insignificant 
compared with foreign offers. I am not interested in money; 
rather, I am interested in encouraging researchers and having 
them work around this tool. We have here a great many 
researchers who deserve every kind of encouragement. 
<H3>  The Minister of Foreign Affairs: `A Symbol of the 
Strengthening of Peace and Security' </H3>
  EL MOUDJAHID: Mr. Minister, how would you evaluate 
this new nuclear acquisition? 
  Minister: It is a universal factor for anything 
that has to do with the use of nuclear energy for peaceful ends, 
especially in the sectors of agriculture, health, and of course 
energy. Many countries produce nuclear electricity. In Algeria, 
there are huge potential uses for nuclear energy, including the 
desalination of sea water. Today, we very explicitly mentioned 
that our nuclear program was set up for peaceful purposes. 
Algeria solemnly announced that it now intends to adhere to the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty. This rules out any possibility 
of using it for military purposes. That was the message given at 
this inauguration. At the same time, we wanted the inauguration 
to take place under conditions of absolute openness. The 
international press as well as the entire diplomatic corps 
accredited in Algiers were present. This project is a symbol of 
the strengthening of international peace and security. It also 
shows that our country possesses a powerful scientific and 
technological potential, that Algeria is the kingpin of Maghreb 
and that it currently contributes much to consolidate not only 
Maghreb unity, but also everything that contributes to the 
economic, cultural and social development of the Maghreb 
community. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: How would you evaluate relations 
between Algeria and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA]? 
  Minister: Mostly, we should note that we have 
excellent relations with the IAEA. Its general director just 
sent a message on the occasion of this inauguration. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: This inauguration coincides with the 
35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations 
between Algeria and China. How would you evaluate these 
relations? 
  Minister: First, I would point out that these 
relations developed satisfactorily since, during our national 
liberation struggle, China was one of the first countries to 
recognize Algeria as a sovereign state aspiring to independence. 
After independence, we developed our relations and strengthened 
them in the economic, commercial, and cultural sectors. This Ain 
Oussera center is the best example of the development of our 
relations. 
<H3>  The Minister of National Education: `The Hard Core of 
Research' </H3>
  EL MOUDJAHID: Could you tell us why it was the 
Ministry of National Education that was the nuclear reactor 
project leader? 
  Minister: This project is in line with Algeria's 
research policy. The research sector depends on the ministry 
delegated to higher education which, as its name indicates, is 
itself delegated to the Ministry of National Education. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: What benefit does Algeria derive 
from this reactor project? 
  Minister: It is an important, even a decisive 
stage, following the first stage, which was that of the Nour 
reactor. The latter was a 1-MGW [as published] research reactor. 
The new Essalam reactor has a 15-MGW power output; in other 
words, it allies research and production, especially the 
production of radioisotopes for agriculture, medicine, and 
pharmacy. It is also a future provider of services for product 
control and analysis through nuclear methods. We have reached a 
stage where Algeria can use this nuclear tool for its economic 
and social development. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: What benefits did Algeria derive 
from the operation of the first Nour reactor? 
  Minister: In spite of its modest capacity, Nour 
enabled Algerian researchers to access the nuclear field for the 
first time. Note that this is the peaceful nuclear field since 
we are talking about peaceful nuclear activities. Nour enabled 
us to access this huge and extremely complex field, to 
familiarize us with it, and it enabled our researchers to master 
the essential aspects of nuclear-related research. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: Is the research personnel entirely 
Algerian? 
  Minister: Yes, 100-percent Algerian; but we wish 
to increase their number. According to our Chinese friends' 
evaluations, Algerian researchers are of appreciable quality. 
They are young, very dynamic, dedicated in spite of difficult 
living conditions. Some are away from their families. Therefore, 
we should train more personnel so as to provide this reactor 
with optimum human capacities in order to benefit from all the 
possibilities it offers. Currently, there are fewer than 100 
researchers and technicians; we should increase that number to 
300 researchers, technicians, and engineers. 
  EL MOUDJAHID: On several occasions, technicians 
and researchers mentioned their difficult working conditions. 
Have you considered taking care of their complaints? 
  Minister: First, I would like to say that most of 
them were educated in Algeria, in universities and research 
institutes. We have 17 research centers, this is the 18th; in a 
way, it is the hard core. Its personnel was educated in Algerian 
schools and Algerian universities. I just promised them that we 
would very seriously consider the matter of their material 
living and working conditions. We must improve these conditions. 
<H5>  The Minister of Agriculture: `Multiple Applications' </H5>
  The impact on agricultural production is manifold. 
Applications to agronomic research are varied. To study problems 
of nutrition or fertilization, we often use fertilizers that 
have been rendered radioactive so we can see what happens to 
these elements in plant nutrition. There are various 
applications in plant biology, in conservation, and even in 
seawater desalination. 
  If we can manage to control desalination costs through the 
use of nuclear energy, it will be extremely useful for 
agriculture, through many future projects, for instance, in 
irrigation. The only problem is one of cost. At any rate, as far 
as conservation or fertilization are concerned, applications 
have become quite common in certain countries. 
  This might happen in our country, too. If we put our 
agricultural economy in order. The center is there; so are the 
researchers, and the land close by; all we have to do is to 
create the environment required to mobilize these capacities and 
technologies in order to enable certain sectors to use nuclear 
energy.

  [Text] Bangalore -- Indian Space Research Organisation 
(ISRO) Chairman UR Rao admitted on Thursday that the Russians 
had gone back on the cryogenic rocket deal, but said talks 
between Glavkosmos, the Russian space agency, and the ISRO on 
the issue were still not over. 
  "The Russians have expressed their inability to extend the 
transfer of technology. That is a fact. We are now 
re-negotiating and seeing what can be done on that," he said. 
Rao was speaking to the Press following the inauguration of the 
Karnataka Hybrid Micro Devices Limited (KHMD), an enterprise set 
up under he ISRO entrepreneur development programme. 
  Asked to verify Moscow-based reports that the Russians were 
willing to supply an increased number of cryogenic engines in 
lieu of the technology transfer, Rao said in diplomacy several 
methods are used by negotiators, one of which includes the 
issuing of all kinds of statements. "Some people will express 
their perceptions of the situation, however, we will announce 
something only if we are satisfied." 
  Asked whether the US embargo on ISRO will be lifted in view 
of the jettisoned cryogenic deal, Rao said now the Americans 
ought to lift the embargo as the facts of the deal falling 
through had received wide publicity. However, ISRO would not 
approach the Americans and ask them to lift the embargo. "I 
don't care what they (the Americans) do. They are the ones who 
imposed the embargo. It is up to them to lift it," he said. 
  Rao agreed that embargoes were a nuisance but pointed out 
that ISRO had enough past experience with them. Many dual-use 
technologies were not available to ISRO and even mundane items 
such as the wheels for the mobile rocket-launching tower were 
not given to ISRO in the past. "We had to make it ourselves," he 
said. "Fundamentally a sovereign country like India has to 
develop its own capability in high technology. We cannot become 
a global competitor if we cannot stand on its own two feet." 
  Pointing out that any country with any high technology held 
on to it, preventing other countries from acquiring it, he said: 
"We must develop our own technologies because the market is 
right here. We must take advantage of it." Rao related the 
apocryphal story of an aspirin manufacturer who said that if 
every Indian and every Chinese took one aspirin a day, then he 
would not have to worry about the rest of the world. 
  Rao reiterated that India's own cryogenic engine would be 
ready in four years. "Nothing will stop us from making it by 
1998. I say this with the biggest confidence because of the kind 
of people we have working in the Space Department." Rao said 
ISRO already had its fuel manufacturing facilities at 
Mahendragiri and testing facilities are being developed 
speedily. ISRO had built a one-tonne cryogenic engine which had 
been tested extensively. "Most of the problems in building a 
bigger engine we will be able to tackle. We do not foresee any 
major technical-problems," he said. 
  Rao pointed out that the Russian contract had been entered 
into after ISRO had decided to go into indigenous manufacture of 
cryogenic engines. "We did not go to anybody for the engines. 
They came to us," he said. First it was General Dynamics of the 
US, then Ariane of France and finally Glavkosmos. Rao said, 
while ISRO had refused the earlier offers, it had accepted the 
Russian offer as it was cheap and it was felt it would cut down 
the time needed to develop an indigenous engine. 
  However, now that renegotiations are on, Rao said whatever 
was agreed to, ISRO would not accept an increase in price. The 
original contract stated a price of Rs [rupees] 235 crore in 
Indian rupees. "We will not pay more than this," he said.

  [Text] Madras, Dec. 15, The Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic 
Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam, reached a milestone in operating 
its Fast Breeder Test Reactor when it raised its power output 
from 8 to 9 MW at 3 p.m. today. 
  According to Mr. S.B. Bhoje, director, Reactor Group, the 
output would be further raised to 10 MW tomorrow morning and to 
10.5 MW in the evening. 
  `Everything is working very nicely. We reached another 
milestone at 3.45 p.m. today, when we completed 10,000 hours of 
operation after the FBTR attained criticality in 1985. Much of 
the 10,000 hours was achieved in 1992 and 1993,' said Mr. Bhoje. 
  The IGCAR scientists and engineers would operate the FBTR at 
10.5 MW for four days. Later, they would do reactor physics 
experiments on the core kinetics and engineering tests on the 
plant dynamics. 
  With today's performance, there was a bright chance of power 
from the FBTR being wheeled into the Tamil Nadu Electricity grid 
in January 1994. 
  The latest developments follow the Atomic Energy Regulatory 
Board clearance for raising the output after various checks. 
  The FBTR output would be raised to 12.5 MW in a few months 
and it would reach its full capacity of 40 MW (thermal) in two 
years, said sources in the Atomic Energy Commission. 
  The FBTR is a forerunner to India's ambitious Prototype Fast 
Breeder Reactor with a capacity of 500 MW (electrical).

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan 31 -- The Defence Research and 
Development Organisation (DRDO) successfully conducted four 
flight tests of the modern anti-tank missile "Nag" [Cobra] 
during the last two days. 
  The Nag missile is a third-generation missile with the range 
of about four km and a top-attack capability for defeating 
advance armour. 
  The recent tests were conducted with a missile carrier track 
vehicle in the user configuration which was developed by the 
DRDO in partnership with the Indian industry. The trials 
included the use of a state-of-the-art thermal sight developed 
by DRDO. 
  "Nag" missile is expected to be ready for induction into the 
Army by 1996. 
  India is one of the three countries that are developing this 
class of advanced missiles.

  [Text] Bombay, December 5--The father of India's missile 
programme and scientific adviser to the defence minister, Dr 
A.P.J. Kalam, today emphasised the need for integrating the 
country's technological strength for the success of any 
scientific project. 
  Dr Kalam was delivering the keynote address at the silver 
jubilee function of the aerospace engineering department of the 
Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. Prof J. 
Chandrashekar, head of the aero-engineering department, welcomed 
the gathering. 
  Citing an example of the successful integration of 
technological strength, he said that 30 key institutions in the 
country participated in the "Prithvi" surface-to-surface missile 
programme of which six were academic. 
  Dr Kalam said that the last of the technology demonstrations 
flights of the "Prithvi" was carried out a week ago at Balasore 
and it was a tremendous success. "Watching it enter target zone 
correctly, I realised the importance and value of integrating 
technological strength," he said. 
  The chief architect of India's space programme said that for 
the supersonic combustion programme four groups were jointly 
working. These were ITT, Madras, the national aerospace 
laboratory, the Indian Institute of Science and the defence 
Research and Development Laboratory. 
  According to Dr Kalam, India needed supersonic combustion 
for 
hypersonic flight and the initial test results in this area were 
satisfactory. 
  Talking about power plants for aerospace systems, he said, 
that "Kaveri" engine was being developed for the prestigious 
Light Combat Aircraft (LCA). He said that the engine was 
expected to go into production in 1997 while the tests were 
expected to start next year--1994. 
  Emphasising the importance of cryogenic engines for India's 
programme, Dr Kalam, said that in such critical areas "we should 
develop it indigenously." 
  However, since some foreign nations had a lead time of 10 to 
15 years, ISRO did not want to lag behind in its programme and 
decided to acquire it. 
  Dr Kalam said that the third stage of the Geo-synchorous 
Launch Vehicle (GSLV) would have a cryogenic engine. 
  "Our missile programme will never use cryogenic engines. If 
people abroad say that we would be using it, it is absurd," he 
said. 
  At yesterday's lecture, he said that in the whole of Asia, 
India had the largest number of aerospace development programmes. 
  According to him for many aircraft and related projects 
international participation would become a reality. 
  At present in India about 50 public sector and private 
sector 
companies, 200 industries, 20 academic institutions and 30 
research and development laboratories were participating in 
aeronautical projects. 
  "A confidence has been built up in the aeronautics community 
not only can it build military aircraft, but it can also enter 
into development and production of civil aircraft with 
international collaboration," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Srinivas Laxman: "DRDO May Develop </F>
Anti-ballistic Missiles"] 
  [Text] Bombay, December 25--The Defence Research and 
Development Organisation (DRDO) is currently carrying out a 
feasibility study to develop what is known as an "anti-ballistic 
missile system." 
  The aim of this system is to guard against incoming missiles 
from rival countries. 
  The first hint of such a project came from the chief of air 
staff, Air Chief Marshal, S.K. Kaul, who expressed the need of 
an "anti missile-missile system," while addressing a news 
conference at Avia-India 93, during the Bangalore air show, last 
week. 
  Subsequent inquiries made by this correspondent with 
aerospace scientists at the air show threw light on the fact 
that a feasibility study for such a project was being carried 
out. 
  They, however, emphasised that no firm decision as yet had 
been taken regarding the matter. 
  The final decision, as with other projects, lay with the 
Union cabinet which would go into all aspects, particularly the 
financial implications and the political fallout, before giving 
the green signal, they said. 
  Speculation in aerospace circles pointed to the possibility 
of the anti-ballistic missile system being based on the 
formidable "Akash" system. 
  The "Akash" system utilises the "Rajendra" multi-function 
phased array radar in a ground support role which has been 
developed for the first time in India. 
  It is capable of multiple targeting, surveillance and 
missile 
handling. The phased array radar was on display at the air show 
and drew a lot of interest from foreign delegates. 
  In another significant development, about 80 per cent of the 
structural components for the prototype of India's Light Combat 
Aircraft (LCA) have already been fabricated. 
  The LCA has been designed as a total weapon system where the 
aircraft constitutes a precision weapon launch platform which 
can carry and deploy a wide range of weapons and stores with a 
quick turnaround time.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 24 (PTI)--The Prime Minister, Mr 
P.V. Narasimha Rao, has said the Chemical Weapons Convention 
(CWC) is a great step in the direction of disarmament. 
  Chairing the consultative committee meeting of the ministry 
of chemicals and fertilizers here last evening, he said the most 
important pillar of any disarmament process is verification. 
  In the case of the CWC, every nation has accepted the 
concept 
of verification. He said the CWC is non-discriminatory in its 
approach and therefore the verification methods adopted in the 
CWC can be compared with similar efforts in the direction of 
disarmament. 
  The Prime Minister pointed out that India has been 
instrumental in bringing about this convention. 
  Emphasising that India is not making any chemical weapons 
and 
it has nothing to hide, the Prime Minister said India plans to 
train the chemical industry in such a way that they are able to 
protect their chemical secrets while undergoing the inspection 
process. 
  The Prime Minister underlined that India has the necessary 
equipment infrastructure facilities and trained manpower to 
protect itself against any possible misuse of such inspections. 
  In his opening remarks, the minister of state for chemicals 
and fertilizewrs, Mr Eduardo Faleiro, said that growth and 
development of chemical industry in India is taking place at a 
faster rate. 
  In case the country is not a signatory, trade related 
imports-exports will be affected very seriously as non-signatory 
parties will have to undergo restrictions in importing as well 
as exporting chemicals with respect to the signatory state 
parties. 
  The minister said the signatory parties will enjoy freedom 
in 
transferring these chemicals among themselves. He informed the 
members that 146 countries have signed this convention which was 
concluded on January 14 this year. 
  Giving details of the connection, Mr Faleiro said it 
prohibits development, production acquisition, stock-piling, 
transfer and use of chemical weapons and their precursors. 
  However, each state party has the right to develop, produce, 
otherwise acquire, retain, transfer and use toxic chemicals and 
their precursors for legitimate purposes, the minister added. 
  It was originally envisaged that the convention would come 
into force in the beginning of 1995. The latest indication from 
the provisional Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical 
Weapons (OPCW) is that the treaty may come into fore by middle 
of 1995 or latest by December 1995.

  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 3--The Government has set up a nodal 
committee of secretaries, presided over by the Cabinet 
Secretary, to study the structure of the proposed National 
Authority being set up to meet obligations under the Chemical 
Weapons Convention. Three groups have been set up under the 
committee, of which one is headed by the Secretary, Chemicals 
and Petrochemicals. 
  The Convention is to come into force in the beginning of 
1995 
with the international secretariat being established in the 
Hague while each signatory nation is to set up a national 
authority. A strong technical support structure required for 
this in the shape of trained manpower and laboratory back up is 
also being planned. 
  This was disclosed here today by the Minister of State for 
Chemicals and Fertilizers, Mr Eduardo Faleiro, while addressing 
the Parliamentary Consultative Committee attached to his 
Ministry. 
  Mr. Faleiro told members that the National Authority will 
collect, transmit and obtain data relating to chemicals 
identified in the Convention. It will also oversee the need to 
ensure that Indian production facilities do not get over-exposed 
to international inspections of such facilities. 
  He felt this was most important since technology needed to 
be 
guarded and inspection should not become a means for obtaining 
information which could allow for duplication of such technology 
in other parts of the world. 
  Mr. Faleiro noted that the Convention is non-discriminatory 
and non-confrontationist in its approach and seeks to eliminate 
all chemical weapons within a fixed time frame. Chemicals which 
come under schedule III, however, have a dual purpose as many of 
them can be used for weapons but also have important benign uses 
in production of pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Signatory 
nations will not have any unfair intrusions into the way they 
utilise these chemicals, apart from keeping a centrally 
established nodal international secretariat informed about 
production, storage and trade in such weapons. 
  The Government will work closely with the chemical industry 
to finalise measures to implement the provisions of the 
Convention. Interaction with industry has already begun as 
several meetings have taken place between industry 
representatives and the Department of Chemicals during which 
implications of the Convention have been conveyed to them. 
  The Minister stressed that it was essential for the 
Government and industry to work together to ensure that the 
international secretariat is not able to build a case against 
any production unit in the country. This was all the more 
important since it is well established that we have no chemicals 
weapons activity in the country. 
  He said the implications of the Chemical Weapons Convention 
on the industry mainly relate to becoming more transparent in 
its functioning and in reporting details of production and sale.

  [Text] Bombay, Jan. 21 -- The Tarapur Atomic Power Station 
(TAPS) will switch over to indigenously developed mixed oxide 
fuel (MOX) in a phased manner from its next refueling stage in 
February, shedding its dependence on imported enriched uranium 
for power generation, Nuclear Power Corporation managing 
director S.K. Chatterjee said on Thursday. 
  Mr. Chatterjee told news persons that this would be the 
first 
experiment of partly using the indigenous fuel to operate the 
Tarapur Atomic Power Plant in view of the uncertainty about 
renewal of supply of enriched uranium from France under the 
India-U.S.- France tripartite agreement which ended in October. 
  He said that to begin with, two bundles of mixed oxide fuel 
along uranium stock from the previous contract was over, would 
start using a mix of low-enriched uranium and MOX at the TAPS. 
  Mr. Chatterjee said "We are [word as published] no fuel 
problem till the end of 2,000 AD." 
  However, he said the options for procuring enriched uranium 
would continue to be explored. "We would buy it from whosoever 
was willing to give it to us," he said while asserting that 
"enriched uranium or no enriched uranium, we have to, and will 
run TAPS and have uninterrupted power generation." 
  Mr. Chatterjee said the Atomic Energy Commission chairman 
had 
already said that India had the capacity to run the two units of 
TAPS project -- one indigenously -- and also had the capability 
to produce enriched uranium. 
  Indian scientists had fully perfected the art of producing 
MOX and using it as a substitute to enriched uranium for 
operation TAPS. 
  Mr. Chatterjee said TAPS would complete successful operation 
of 25 years on April 1, 1994 and enter into the 26th year. "We 
will run it for another 14 years." 
  He said the safety assessment for renewal of operations had 
already been completed by SARRA [expansion unknown] after 
inspection.

<F P=106> [Article: "Facilities in N-Plants Adequate To Deal With </F>
Emergencies"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 16. The emergency preparedness plans 
of nuclear installations in the country are considered adequate, 
the Rajya Sabha was told today. 
  Before a nuclear installation began operation, its 
management 
prepared an emergency response plan in accordance with the 
guidelines of the atomic energy regulatory board, the Minister 
of State in the Prime Minister's Office, Mr. Bhuvnesh 
Chaturvedi, told Mr. Ghufran Azam and K.K. Birla in a written 
reply. 
  The offsite emergency response plan was also approved by the 
State Government concerned. 
  In order to maintain a state of readiness to combat any 
emergency, training courses and regular exercises were conducted 
for plant site as well as off-site areas, he said. 
  The feed-back of such exercises was recorded and the 
emergency preparedness plans were reviewed to make improvements, 
if any, for enhancing their effectiveness. 
  Technology upgradation: Mr. Chaturvedi said the 
Government had decided to upgrade the technology of turbine 
generators for atomic power plants manufactured by the public 
sector Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited in the wake of a fire 
accident in the Narora Atomic Power Plant. 
  The Minister said the Government had already received the 
enquiry committee report on the Narora accident and steps were 
being taken to prevent the recurrence of such a fire. 
  He said the committee was of the view though the fire was 
serious in nature, it was not a major accident. -- PTI

  [Text] Kuwait City, Feb 7 (AFP) -- UN disarmament chief 
Rolf Ekeus said here Monday [7 February] he was not convinced 
that Iraq had provided full details about its chemical weapons. 
  "We feel quite satisfied, but not fully satisfied," the head 
of the UN Special Commission on disarming Iraq (UNSCOM) told 
reporters, following his four-day mission to Baghdad. 
  "In the chemical area we are not satisfied that Iraq has 
given us full, detailed information necessary for us to be 
definite that all these weapons have been taken away," Ekeus 
said. 
  The Swedish UN official on Sunday ended a visit to Iraq 
saying Baghdad and the United Nations still disagreed over 
certain aspects of the long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons 
programmes, despite their determination to implement the 
surveillance measures quickly. 
  Ekeus said Monday he was confident that all Iraq's 
long-range 
missiles had been destroyed, along with the production 
facilities. 
  "We have the satisfactory feeling that most of the Iraqi 
capabilities have now been destroyed and eliminated," Ekeus 
said, referring to the dismantling of Iraqi weapons programmes 
in line with the 1991 Gulf war ceasefire conditions. 
  In a joint statement issued in Baghdad Sunday, Ekeus and 
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz said both sides 
"expressed their readiness to expedite the process of 
establishing ongoing monitoring and verification in a spirit of 
goodwill." 
  They said their aim was to enable the International Atomic 
Energy Agency to report to the UN Security Council "that, in 
their view, Iraq had taken all the actions called for by 
paragraph 22 of Resolution 687." 
  The clause provides for the lifting of the international oil 
embargo against Iraq once Baghdad has honoured UN resolutions 
calling for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed four 
days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. 
  Ekeus was due to leave Kuwait for New York Monday, Kuwaiti 
officials said.

<F P=106> [By Faruq Choukri] </F>
  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 6 (AFP) -- A senior UN official said 
here Sunday the United Nations and Baghdad still disagreed over 
certain aspects of the long-term monitoring of Iraq's weapons 
programmes, despite their pledge to implement the measures 
quickly. 
  Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Special Commission on disarming 
Iraq, told reporters after talks with senior Iraqi officials 
that "there are definitely different assessments" concerning the 
surveillance programme. 
  "There are still some question marks, and we have been 
working on them with some, but not complete, success during 
these talks," Ekeus said before leaving for Kuwait. 
  Ekeus, who arrived in Baghdad Wednesday, held talks with 
Deputy Foreign Minister Tariq 'Aziz, Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Sa'id al-Sahhaf and General 'Amir Muhammad Rashid, head of the 
military industrialization organization. 
  In a joint statement, Ekeus and Aziz said both sides 
"expressed their readiness to expedite the process of 
establishing ongoing monitoring and verification in a spirit of 
goodwill." 
  They said their aim was to enable the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) to report to the UN Security Council "that, 
in their view, Iraq had taken all the actions called for by 
paragraph 22 of Resolution 687." 
  The clause provides for the lifting of the international oil 
embargo against Iraq once Baghdad has honoured UN resolutions 
calling for the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  Ekeus said he tried to emphasise in his talks with Iraqi 
leaders the "political ambiance" surrounding the clause. 
  He was referring to the position of certain UN Security 
Council members, notably the United States, which oppose any 
lifting of the oil embargo until Baghdad recognises the 
sovereignty of Kuwait and improves its policy toward the Moslem 
Shiite and Kurdish minorities in Iraq. 
  Iraqi Foreign Ministry Under-Secretary Riyad al-Qaysi, who 
spoke at a news conference with Ekeus Sunday, said Iraq had 
"implemented all that is required" under the clause. 
  However, last week U.S. President Bill Clinton said Iraq 
still had a long way to go toward compliance with the Gulf war 
ceasefire conditions, despite Baghdad's acceptance of UN 
Security Council Resolution 715 in November, which called for 
long-term weapons monitoring. 
  The joint statement issued by Ekeus and 'Aziz said the 
"intense phase" of UN inspections would continue, and Iraq had 
"indicated that it would welcome all such inspection teams and 
facilitate their tasks." 
  The two sides discussed technical matters in a "professional 
and business-like manner," the statement said, and their talks 
"yielded positive results." 
  They agreed to hold a further round of talks in the first 
half of March to maintain the momentum in the disarmament 
process. 
  In the hope of obtaining an end to the embargo, Baghdad is 
cooperating with efforts to dismantle programmes for nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons, which are banned under the UN 
resolutions ending the 1991 Gulf war. 
  UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were imposed four 
days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990. 
  On Friday, IAEA officials said they would remove the last 
batch of Iraq's irradiated fuel next week and start setting up 
cameras at former nuclear sites. 
  The joint statement said Iraq and the United Nations had 
"built on the significant progress" made since last July, when 
the two sides discussed the possibility of lifting the oil 
embargo. 
  Iraq meanwhile reiterated its rejection of a plan to sell 
some of its oil under UN control. 
  Under UN Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712, Iraq is 
allowed to sell up to 1.6 billion dollars' worth of oil for six 
months under international supervision. The proceeds must be 
used to buy food and medical supplies, fund UN activities in 
Iraq, and pay war damages.

  [Text] Manama, Jan 30 (AFP) -- The head of a 16-member UN 
arms inspection team said here Sunday his just-ended mission to 
Iraq was a success, adding that Iraqi officials had promised to 
cooperate in setting up a monitoring system. 
  "We achieved all objectives," said Russian team leader 
Nikita 
Smidovitch, who told reporters his 10-day mission to Iraq had 
been "successful." 
  Smidovitch was inspecting Iraq's military arsenal under UN 
Security Council Gulf war ceasefire resolutions. 
  "The Iraqis had a forthcoming attitude," Smidovitch said. 
"Iraq has promised to cooperate and said they will do what they 
can to shorten ?he period" needed to set the monitoring process 
in motion. 
  He was to leave Manama, the United Nations' base for Iraqi 
missions, late Sunday. 
  The long-term monitoring of the Iraqi arms program is 
crucial 
to Baghdad's hopes for an end to the embargo imposed after the 
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. By accepting Security 
Council Resolution 715, Iraq hopes to at least have UN sanctions 
on its oil exports lifted. 
  Asked how many missions were still needed before long-term 
monitoring could begin, Smidovitch replied? "Quite frankly, it 
will take time. We need more activities to set up the 
monitoring process." 
  The surveillance program is the next UN step following the 
destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction af?er the Gulf 
war of January-February 1991. 
  Iraq agreed to the surveillance in November after rejecting 
it for three years and has been lobbying hard for an end to the 
embargo. 
  On Wednesday, the UN's deputy disarmament chief said 
long-term monitoring of Baghdad's weapons program was still some 
way off despite Iraq's efforts to have sanctions lifted. 
  American Charles Duelfer, deputy head of the UN Special 
Commission (UNSCOM) disarming Iraq under the Gulf war ceasefire 
resolutions, spent five days in Iraq preparing a visit there 
this week by his boss Rolf Ekeus. 
  Ekeus is due to arrive in Baghdad on Tuesday to discuss 
monitoring, but has said he is unlikely to recommend a lifting 
of sanctions before the end of the year.

  [Text] Baghdad, Jan 31 (INA)--Another chapter of U.S.-led 
conspiracy has opened with the allegations that German and Saudi 
inspectors have found two containers loaded with hundreds of 
tons of chemicals on board a freighter at Jeddah Port in Saudi 
Arabia. The inspectors claim that the freighter was heading to 
Beirut where the chemicals were to be unloaded and transported 
to Iraq which will use the stuff in making missiles, says THE 
BAGHDAD OBSERVER editorial. 
  The news spread as quickly as possible and the Western as 
well as the American media flexed their muscles in manipulating 
the allegations to serve their masters' interests. The 
above-mentioned media quoted a German official as saying that 
German intelligence has obtained the information of the 
freighter from their Saudi counterpart. 
  Those who have fabricated this story are themselves the same 
enemy of Iraq. They themselves were behind the imposition of 
sanctions against the Iraqis and they themselves were parties to 
the U.S.-led aggression which destroyed Iraq's infrastructure 
and killed thousands of innocent Iraqi people. Hence what they 
claim comes as no surprise to the Iraqis who are well-aware of 
the tactics of their enemy, the editorial added. 
  When Iraq announced that it was ready to abide by all UN 
resolutions these dubious circles began to launch campaigns with 
the aim of putting a spoke in the wheel of Iraq [words 
indistinct] states to even recommend the lifting of the more 
than three years sanctions against a nation of 18 million people. 
  The daily maintained that the human rights issues was on top 
of U.S. agenda of conspiracy against Iraq. The U.S. and its 
allies Britain and France in particular released their 
accusation against Iraq and said that Iraq was abusing human 
rights in the south of the country and denying the people in the 
north food rations. What these circles alleged is definitely 
false because those people, the Iraqis, who live in the south of 
the country are suffering from the same sanctions imposed on 
Iraq by the UN under U.S. pressures. As to the people of the 
north, the Iraqi government sends them their food ration 
regularly. But the outlawed elements there, supported by the 
U.S. and its allies, steal the food ration of their people and 
sell it in the black market. 
  Today the U.S. and its allies have created another way to 
distort Iraq's reputation before the international community 
which is calling for an end to the blockade imposed on the 
Iraqis. Furthermore, the Saudi regime for its part has been 
showering money upon their puppets in the Western and American 
media to publicize such a lie, the motive of which is well-known 
for the Iraqis. The Saudi regime only wants to keep the embargo 
on Iraq to serve the interests of its allies. 
  Nevertheless it has become crystal clear that the U.S. and 
their agents including the Saudi puppets can never succeed in 
either undermining the morale of the Iraqis, nor can they 
deceive the world public opinion because the truth will soon 
come up and those who fabricated the allegations will be exposed 
by their own people, THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER concluded.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Pressler Snag"] </F>
  [Text] The Pakistan specific Pressler Amendment, ostensibly 
aimed at curbing Pakistan's nuclear designs, has been 
reincorporated in the revised draft of the Foreign Assistance 
Act submitted to U.S. Congress last week by the Clinton 
Administration. The discussion draft submitted on 22 November 
1993 had sought to repeal the amendment taking the view that all 
country specific amendments must be done away with. However, it 
was obvious, given he significance of the nuclear issue within 
the South Asian context, that Pressler would witness the 
fiercest battle between the Administration and the Congress. 
Senator Larry Pressler had them vowed to fight tooth and nail 
for the inclusion of his amendment. It appears now that he did. 
Analysts, both in Pakistan and abroad had built scenarios, 
linking Administration's attempts at shooting down the amendment 
as reciprocating Islamabad's tacit approval of toeing the 
international line on Kashmir. It was thought at the time that 
Washington was posturing to indicate to India its 
dissatisfaction with the human rights violations as also the 
dated Indian rhetoric of Kashmir being its atoot ang [integral 
part]. Ms. Robin Raphel's visit and her statements on the issue 
and Islamabad's decision to withdraw the resolution in the UN, 
condemning human rights violations by India in the valley, 
seemed to point to a nexus of sorts. The Administration on its 
part had given the general impression that Pressler had failed 
to advance Washington's objectives of non-proliferation, raising 
hopes that the amendment might be scrapped. The scenario has 
come apart. 
  While the Americans might see this development in the 
domestic context of a usual fight between the Administration and 
the Congress, the reincorporation of the amendment in the 
Foreign Assistance Act has different connotations for Pakistan. 
And this does not just include the man on the street, but 
virtually everyone. There may be a spate of concerned statements 
on Kashmir by Americans, Ms Raphel's being the latest, but it is 
obvious that when it comes to the crunch, it is always Pakistan 
that falls on hard times. The development also does not 
dovetail with the viewpoint of some American analysts who have 
been advising Washington to remain even-handed in South Asia, 
especially in the military sphere. Simply put it means that the 
conventional strength of the Pakistani defence forces should at 
least be kept at a level where paranoid does not set in, forcing 
it to rely on non-conventional options in the face of growing 
imbalance of conventional forces vis-a-vis India. Now with the 
amendment still clamped on, the squeeze continues. While the 
ground forces could manage to scout for alternatives the air 
force, hardest hit by the amendment, is growing desperate. 
There is the question of the delivery of 71 F-16s for which 
Pakistan has already paid $658 million but which it cannot get 
because of the amendment. However, it has to keep paying the 
installments, another snag on which the two governments, 
according to one report, have been stumbling. While it would be 
optimistic to say that Islamabad could survive the amendment, 
even if the costs be high, the US response to the people of this 
country does not enhance its credibility in the eyes of most 
Pakistani. Given the present escalation of tension in the 
region on the question of Kashmir, the development could bode 
ill, forcing the saner element to concede ground to the hawks.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The New U.S. Condition for Economic and </F>
Military Aid"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Administration has hinted that 
restrictions on economic and military aid to all nonnuclear 
states will be maintained even if the Pressler Amendment is 
abolished. A discussion paper addressed to congressmen said 
that the U.S. Government will make economic and military 
assistance conditional to freezing, rolling back, and eventual 
destruction of the nuclear program. It has been clarified to 
Pakistan also that freezing the nuclear program will not be 
enough. The program will have be rolled back if it wants to 
receive the aid which is now lying in the pipeline. 
  Pakistan should not foster any optimism after the clear 
indication by the U.S. Administration because the United States 
is not even satisfied with our present position and it wants a 
total scrapping of the nuclear program. Given this situation, 
Pakistan is left with no alternative but to achieve 
self-sufficiency in arms production and to try to become a 
self-reliant country to get rid of economic aid and loans. The 
government should pay immediate attention to making basic 
changes in the nation's economic structure and policies so that 
the objective can be achieved. It should give top priority to 
reliance on domestic resources, checking waste, increasing 
national production, and especially to developing Pakistan's 
relations with the economic bloc of Islamic countries. 
  It is encouraging that Pakistani scientists and engineers 
have begun work on attaining the capability to design and set up 
nuclear power plants. It will at least help overcome the 
country's power crisis, thereby accelerating the pace of 
industrial development. Since India has already become a nuclear 
power, it will not be affected by the U.S. restrictions. 
Furthermore, the United States is also giving preferential 
treatment to India. Pakistan has refused to accept any 
unilateral U.S. restrictions. 
  After the U.S. Administration's latest decision, Pakistan 
should now depend on its own resources to meet its defense and 
economic requirements instead of seeking help from the United 
States. We can fully overcome this trial if we can master the 
subject of efficient planning and rely on our own resources. We 
should never think of renouncing the nuclear technology which we 
acquired with our own labor, talent, and resources because it is 
a matter of protecting our sovereignty and independence. Any 
compromise on it will be tantamount to national suicide.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Offer of Effective Defense in Exchange </F>
for Nuclear Program Is Not Acceptable"] 
  [Text] According to press reports, a five-member delegation 
of the U.S. State Department's "Arms Control and Disarmament 
Agency" has come here to hold extensive talks with Pakistani 
authorities on the nuclear nonproliferation issue. A proposal 
will probably be made by the U.S. side that if Pakistan abandons 
its nuclear program, then it will be offered a package which 
will include the supply of the most modern conventional weapons 
and steps to make the Pakistani Armed Forces more effective in 
the battlefield. 
  Pakistan's nuclear program has long been an eyesore for the 
United States and heavy pressure is being exerted on Pakistan so 
it will abandon the program. The United States, through a 
constitutional amendment, has suspended military and economic 
aid to Pakistan. The irony is that the delivery of F-16 planes, 
for which Pakistan already paid, also has been withheld. A 
notice was also issued to pay the storage charges for those 
planes. The United States has not only taken a number of 
serious steps against Pakistan to punish it for the nuclear 
program, but also instructed the rest of the world to strangle 
Pakistan. Despite having an agreement, France withheld the 
supply of a nuclear reactor. Last year, Japan also curtailed 
its aid to Pakistan. China is the only country which is 
unwilling to bow to U.S. pressure. The United States has made 
the whole world, with the exception of China, hostile toward 
Pakistan. 
  The United States is pursuing a double-standard policy on 
the 
nuclear program issue. It vehemently dislikes Pakistan's 
nuclear efforts. It, however, did not even say a single word 
about India, which already carried out a nuclear explosion in 
1974. About a dozen nuclear research centers are active 
throughout India, and according to a report of the United 
States' own CIA, India possesses enriched uranium sufficient to 
produce 40 to 100 nuclear bombs. India's past history also 
proves that it has the habit of launching aggression and it has 
ventured into military adventure with all its neighbors. 
Pakistan was made the target of the Indian aggression in 1949, 
1965, 1971, and 1984. And now, for the last five years, Indian 
forces are engaged in bloodshed and massacre in occupied 
Kashmir. The danger is always there that India might embark on 
an onslaught against Pakistan in its disgust with the Kashmir 
freedom movement. Indian leaders are also threatening Pakistan 
with a limited war. 
  Pakistan is left with only one option given this situation. 
That is to use the nuclear program as a deterrent. It is 
because of Pakistan's nuclear program that India dared not 
launch any aggression against Pakistan since 1971 despite the 
Siachen and Kashmir incidents. The fact is that it is not 
possible for Pakistan to match India in the field of 
conventional weapons. India not only possesses nuclear 
capability, it has amassed conventional weapons as well. Unlike 
Pakistan, the United States has not imposed any restrictions on 
India on the acquisition of conventional weapons, nor does India 
care for any pressure from the United States either. Therefore, 
for Pakistan, relinquishing the nuclear program is tantamount to 
inviting its own death, God forbid. 
  As far as the possible U.S. offer -- that Pakistan's 
position 
in conventional weapons will be bolstered and its Army will be 
strengthened -- is concerned, we will only say that it is 
difficult to trust any U.S. promise. The United States 
concluded a defense agreement in 1959 accepting the 
responsibility to defend Pakistan in the event of a communist 
aggression. But when India, as a protege of the Soviet Union 
and with the strength of Soviet weaponry, launched a naked 
aggression against Pakistan in 1965, then the United States 
suspended defense aid to Pakistan and also stopped supplying 
spare parts rather than honor its commitment. When India again 
launched aggression against Pakistan in 1971, the United States 
again remained a silent spectator. Consequently, Pakistan was 
dismembered by India using its massive military might. India, 
which then entered into a defense agreement with communist 
Soviet Union, was openly supported by it. Pakistan's allegiance 
to the United States on the other hand can be gauged by the fact 
that it offered its territory for the U.S. U-2 spy planes, 
thereby angering the Soviet Union. The situation today on the 
part of Pakistan still remains same. According to a report, the 
U.S. spy planes are stationed at Chaklala air base. Obviously, 
these planes will spy on Pakistan itself or will pick up our 
friendly country China as its target. India is a friend of the 
United States. 
  The U.S. commandos have left after completing their 
exercises. Reports say that the U.S. naval fleet is now engaged 
in joint naval exercises with the Pakistani Navy. Recently, 
General Joseph P. Hoar, the U.S. Central Command chief, also 
paid a visit to Pakistan. The U.S. ambassador enjoys the status 
of a viceroy in Pakistan. On the other hand, the treatment 
given to Pakistan by the United States is evident to everyone. 
During the last year, the United States tried hard to declare 
Pakistan a terrorist state. It is now feared that the United 
States might divide Kashmir in a way which suits its own 
interests. Pakistan is sometimes accused of being a 
fundamentalist or religiously fanatic state. 
  Given this situation, under no circumstances can Pakistan 
trust the U.S. promises. We do not know why our government 
leaders want to hold talks on acquiring a U.S. defense umbrella 
in exchange for abandoning the nuclear program. The United 
States did not help Pakistan when it needed it. How can we 
expect that it will help in the future? U.S. support for the 
Afghan mojahedin or Pakistan during the Afghan war was due to 
its own interests. The proof is that as soon as the Soviet 
Union disintegrated, the United States turned its eyes from the 
Afghan mojahedin and Pakistan. Afghanistan is still reeling 
under bloodshed and Pakistan's difficulties are still the same 
as before. Pakistan should clearly say "no" to the U.S. 
delegation and accept no U.S. offer at the cost of abandoning 
the nuclear program. The United States should also understand 
Pakistan's compulsions in the region and impose no condition 
which makes Pakistan vulnerable to Indian aggression. Pakistan 
should have the right to defend its independence and sovereignty 
and it is not possible without the nuclear deterrent.

<F P=106> [By Munir Ahmad Khan] </F>
  [Text] It is widely assumed that Pakistan has achieved 
nuclear capability and can exercise the nuclear option if and 
when in the future a political decision is made in this regard. 
This capability has been earned at great technical economic and 
political cost. As time passes, Pakistan will be subjected to 
even stronger pressures to compromise on the nuclear issue and 
roll back or even abandon its nuclear programme. National 
interest demands that we retain our nuclear option as long as 
India does as it may take India a considerable time before it 
agrees to subscribe to the Non-Proliferation Regime for Sough 
Asia as has been proposed by Pakistan. During this period 
Pakistan has to maintain its nuclear capability. The question 
is now can we sustain our nuclear option. 
  Realistically speaking, pressures on Pakistan will mount and 
not decrease with time. The US commitment to non-proliferation 
is toughening and not receding. World public opinion is turning 
against nuclear weapons even in the hands of nuclear powers and 
certainly more and more against the so-called near-nuclear 
weapons states such as India, Pakistan and Israel. There is 
hardly any difference of views among the nuclear-haves that 
further proliferation has to be contained. So we will have very 
few or no allies to back us up. We may even be on our own. 
  The assumption that once a country acquires nuclear 
capability it cannot be eroded or taken away is rather naive and 
an illusion. While it takes considerable technical skill and 
political determination to achieve this, in the first place it 
needs even greater effort to retain it later on. France was a 
nuclear rebel until the 1980s but the changed international 
situation and pressures from its partners in Europe and across 
the Atlantic compelled it to conform to the NPT 
[Nonproliferation Treaty] South Africa was able to build a small 
nuclear arsenal by defying international embargoes over a long 
time, but found it politically impossible to hold on to it and 
had to surrender 8 or 10 nuclear bombs it had built. Ukraine, 
with its 1,600 nuclear warheads, ranks as the third nuclear 
power in the world and has sophisticated long-range missiles to 
deliver them to any part of the world. Yet it cannot even 
service this arsenal. Its economic and security compulsions 
have forced it to give up this formidable capability. Even the 
UK finds it harder and harder to hold on to its modest stockpile 
of nuclear weapons in spite of its imperial longings. 
  It appears that its is relatively less difficult to climb 
the 
nuclear ladder but much harder to hang on after getting there. 
We should not underestimate the challenges we will face in 
sustaining our nuclear option and must prepare ourselves to do 
all that it takes to keep it. 
  While it will become increasingly hard for us to retain our 
nuclear option it is relatively easy to lose it. The quickest 
way to do this would be to increase our nuclear rhetoric to win 
greater public applause at home. This nuclear jingoism which 
our politicians and technologists have engaged in to win cheap 
popularity has been extremely costly to the nation. It has sent 
completely wrong signals abroad and played into the hands of our 
opponents. It also provides a ready excuse to India to continue 
with its massive nuclear programme. It is, therefore very 
important that both the government and the opposition and all 
responsible leaders of various parties exercise restraint when 
talking about the nuclear issue. This is needed particularly at 
a time when the US Congress has started debating a revision of 
the Foreign Assistance Act which could hopefully dilute the 
Pressler Amendment and provide an opening for the US President 
to resume US Pakistan cooperation in the economic and defence 
fields. 
  Even if the Pressler Amendment is somehow miraculously 
withdrawn or circumvented it will only be a temporary relief. 
The nuclear issue between the US and Pakistan will not be 
resolved as the US will continue to pursue its objectives 
through other means. India will persist in strengthening its 
nuclear muscle and reach posing a growing threat to our 
securing. The stakes will get higher and higher. The strategy 
we should develop must be one which enables us to keep the 
nuclear option open for a long time. This means we should take 
immediate steps to reduce our vulnerability to outside pressures 
and build up the strength and stamina to resist coercion. 
  Politically we need a renewed commitment to our nuclear 
programme and to maintain the nuclear consensus. The Government 
and Opposition have to speak with one voice so that there is no 
rollback and no unilateral compromise. This demands a measure 
of political maturity on all sides. We have to take the nuclear 
issue out of the political areas so that it is above petty 
politics. 
  Economically, Pakistan is extremely vulnerable. Our 
dependence on foreign economic and financial aid has to be 
reduced. We have to put our economic house in order. This 
requires making tough and unpopular economic decisions which is 
not an easy matter for any political government. But we can not 
expect the aid donors to underpin our economy so that we enjoy 
the luxury of wasting funds at home and continue to postpone 
economic reforms. Without a strong economy no country can ever 
maintain a nuclear option. 
  In the defence field, we are highly dependent on foreign 
military supplies equipment and hardware. India meets 80 per 
cent of its defence needs through indigenous production while we 
are critically dependent on imports. We have to build our own 
defence industry. It will require a bold new approach to 
mobilise our internal technical and human resources, involve the 
private enterprise and establish the essential infrastructure 
for our defence industry which we have neglected so far. 
  All weapon systems, including nuclear devices, lose their 
effectiveness over time. New technological advances render them 
obsolete. Defence preparedness is not static. It has to be 
renewed and upgraded year after year. This needs both local 
R&amp;D 
and access to new and emerging technologies. Unfortunately, our 
technological base is very small and is, in fact, not growing. 
We do not have the skilled manpower systems and replace the 
imported ones whose cost is increasing and the political price 
becoming prohibitive. Getting dual-purposed and sensitive 
technology from abroad is getting more complicated. Over the 
last 15 years. We have lost access to R&amp;D [Research and 
Development] laboratories and hightech establishments abroad 
where Pakistanis are not admitted. Some people at home have 
made wild claims about our attainments and raised doubts about 
our intentions which have served to close doors on our students 
studying abroad. We may well have lost two precious decades in 
updating our knowledge and getting into the main stream of the 
latest technology because we could not resist the talking too 
much and raising slogans of technological defiance when we have 
yet yet to develop a sound technological and scientific 
infrastructure. Time has come for us us to get sober and get 
down to work. 
  In the early years of our nuclear programme speed (or 
apparent speed) was of paramount importance. Like others we 
indulged in ad hocism and ignored the rules of the nuclear game; 
and we are paying for it. The others learnt from their mistakes 
and quickly set up institutions to tighten control over all 
aspects of nuclear activities and developed well considered 
policies. We are persisting in our old random ways which expose 
us to greater political, financial and technical risks. Instead, 
we should benefit from the experience of others and quickly 
develop and institute our own Control and Command System so that 
the nuclear capability we are supposed to have remains at the 
command of the State and not at the whims of the individuals who 
as politicians, technologists and policy makers, may use them 
for their own ends. We have to send a convincing message to the 
world at large that we, too, are capable of accepting and 
exercising nuclear discipline and possess the maturity to 
control what we have with as much responsibility and restraint 
as others. 
  A country should have well-defined nuclear objectives which 
should be pursued through a flexible nuclear policy which takes 
into account the fast moving dynamics of the evolving world 
scene. Even the superpowers have responded to changing 
circumstances by adapting themselves rather than remaining 
rigid. We should know what we want in the long run and achieve 
it through our ability to negotiate with others without 
surrendering our principles. Nuclear weapons are losing their 
legitancy as weapons for warfare but they are useful as 
deterrents and as instruments of negotiation to attain security 
goals. Pakistan has to find a way to convince Washington that 
the country specific amendment against Pakistan is indeed 
counter-productive, and that US and Pakistan interests require 
that Pakistan is not forced to give up the nuclear unilaterally 
but only in a regional framework of security and 
non-proliferation. 
  In brief, our continued retention of the nuclear option over 
a long period will need much greater skill and acemen than we 
are used to. We have to muture a nuclear consensus at home so 
that the political will remains undiminished and people make the 
sacrifices which are called for. We have to strengthen our 
economy, modernuise and broaden our scientific and technological 
base, strengthen our conventional defence and industrial 
capability, refine our control and command system, calrify our 
nuclear goals and policies, restrict our rhetoric and improve 
our nuclear diplomacy. We have to build up our internal 
strength and stamina to retain what we have and build on it 
further to meet the inevitable challenges ahead.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Pakistan will be able to manufacture 
its own nuclear power reactors sooner than later. 
  This was disclosed by the chairman Pakistan Atomic Energy 
Commission (PAEC), Dr. Ishfaq Ahmad, while speaking at a 
discussion on Pakistan Television Monday evening. 
  Former chairman of the commission, Munir Ahmed Khan, was the 
other participant, while Farhatullah Babar, press secretary to 
prime minister, was the moderator. 
  "In fact, a successful experiment in this regard had already 
been made," informed Dr. Ishfaq. 
  He reiterated the government's resolve to continue its 
peaceful nuclear programme. 
  "It is an issue on which there is complete national 
consensus," Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed said. He was of the view that in 
the wake of scarce energy resources, it was an imperative for 
Pakistan to concentrate on its peaceful nuclear programme. 
  "Pakistan's nuclear programme was totally peaceful and its 
sole objective was the social uplift of the people," remarked 
Dr. Ishfaq. 
  Pakistan, fortunately, had a number of highly professional 
and qualified scientists, who were busy undertaking research 
work in a variety of fields relating to nuclear science, said 
the chairman PAEC. 
  "Research and development (R&amp;D) programme, which is 
working 
for past 25 years, had been further strengthened, and Pinstech 
was leading the programme," told Dr. Ishfaq. 
  He also informed that at the Kanupp, scientists have 
prepared 
spare-parts and a full-fledged computer programme, which speaks 
volumes of their capability in the field. 
  Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed told the viewers that the 300-megawatt 
Chashma nuclear power plant, being setup with the assistance of 
China, will be operative within the next two years. 
  The usage of nuclear technology in agriculture, industry, 
and 
health sectors was also dilated upon by Dr Ishfaq who told that, 
so far, 180,000 patients had benefited from the techniques 
introduced at centres where nuclear technology was being used. 
  Munir Ahmed Khan, former chairman of the PAEC, said in the 
wake of atomic blast by India in 1974, Pakistan intensified his 
efforts to expand its nuclear capability. Initially, he 
recalled, the emphasis was on increasing our scientific 
manpower, which stood at 300 then, and to provide them the 
latest scientific education. 
  "Unfortunately, all the advanced countries stopped fufilling 
their commitments to Pakistan in the aftermath of atomic blast 
by India," observed Munir Ahmed Khan. 
  In this context, he referred to the Pak-French agreement for 
reprocessing plant and stoppage of spare-parts for Kanupp by 
Canada. 
  Consequently, he said, centres of nuclear studies were set 
up. 
  "That was the period when the Pakistan scientists were 
compelled to depend on self-reliance which has paid dividends 
over the years," reflected the former chairman PAEC. He termed 
the commission as one of the best institutions and a centre of 
excellence in the muslim world. 
  Farhatullah Babar said that the government of Benazir Bhutto 
was determined to pursue peaceful nuclear programme to meet the 
energy shortage that the country was facing. 
  He referred to the recent visit to PAEC by the prime 
minister. In her address to the council's annual meeting, told 
the moderator, the prime minister had categorically stated that 
her Islamic, awami and democratic government was determined to 
fulfil the dream of late Z. A. Bhutto who, with the cooperation 
of the United States, had laid the foundation of Pinstech and 
other scientic organizations.

  [Text] Jan 19 -- The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission 
[PAEC] has established an institute for nuclear power to develop 
conceptual and detailed design and analysis of the nuclear steam 
supply systems (NSSS) adopted for indigenous design and 
construction as well as for analyses and experimentation for 
safety evaluation of nuclear power plants. 
  Based at the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and 
Technology (PINSTECH), Nilore, the Institute would also study, 
review and document work relating to nuclear power plants being 
carried out at the PAEC establishments and create a nucleus of 
available expertise. 
  The Institute would also advise on re-orientation of 
research 
and development week in the light of an on going critical 
techno- economic evaluation of NPP [nuclear power plant] 
concepts and latest advances in design engineering and safety 
enhancement.

<F P=106> [From the "Test Range" program: Exclusive report over video </F>
entitled "When Missiles Are Dying..." detailing missile 
deactivation process, attributed in the credits to "Radar" 
Studio and Ministry of Defense Central Television and Radio 
Studio, August-December 1993; figures in brackets denote 
broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds] 
  [Excerpts] [070731 thru 070813 -- introductory passage 
omitted] 
  [070814] [Correspondent over video captioned "Radar-TV" 
showing missile transporters on the move] The strategic arms 
reduction treaties concluded between the United States and 
Russia and known as START I and START II have, apart from verbal 
support, evoked no steps in response from the other members of 
the nuclear club. START II is yet to be ratified by Russia. 
Meanwhile the latter's missiles, including the heavy SS-18, 
continue to be removed from operational sites. This work was at 
its height during the summer and fall of last year. As in the 
past, missile men and defense experts displayed prompt and 
coordinated action at all the stages of the reduction process 
right up to the removal of missiles from silos and the draining 
off of missile fuel components. On the one hand, they were 
working under pressure of a tight schedule since every missile 
had to be removed from alert duty on strictly preset days and 
hours, while on the other hand they had to ensure that all the 
operations were carried out without any dangerous pollution of 
the environment ensuing. 
  [070908] [video shows missile being removed from silo, 
personnel donning gas masks, fuel being siphoned off] 
  [070909 thru 071021] [passage omitted on interview with 
engineer who says that ecological safety is guaranteed thanks to 
a closed-circuit system which prevents contact between fuel 
components and atmosphere] 
  [071022] [Correspondent over aerial view of missile test 
range captioned "Radar-TV, VoyenTV"] Our industry cannot do 
something that it was never equipped to do, in other words to 
salvage simultaneously up to 2,000 ICBM's, hundreds of thousands 
of tonnes of special fluids and nuclear and chemical munitions. 
What is more, we lack the necessary resources. 
  This also applies to cleaning up the Russian Missile Forces' 
sole test range which covers an area of 175,000 hectares. 
During test launches certain parts of the delivery vehicle 
separate. They contain toxic rocket fuel residue. All this 
does not burn up in the atmosphere but falls to the ground and 
into water reservoirs. Two years ago the leadership of the 
Missile Forces together with (?"Transres"), a special science 
and production center, tried for the first time to carry out a 
mass cleanup of the test range, using their own resources. More 
than 2,000 tonnes of delivery vehicle debris was collected, but 
only a small part of the test range was cleared. 
  By agreeing to sweeping reductions of the most powerful and 
technically most sophisticated missiles, Russia has not only 
forfeited its status as an influential partner in resolving 
strategic issues, but it also finds itself in a most 
disadvantageous position in terms of the need to observe all the 
necessary ecological and environmental protection safeguards 
during the elimination of the stockpiled weapons. 
  [071142] [video shows aerial view of missile test range, 
test launch, computer graphics, debris littering the test range] 
  [071143 thru 071230 -- passage omitted on officer describing 
operations to clean up 16,000 tonnes of debris accumulated at 
the test range] 
  [071231] [Correspondent over video of operation to remove 
nose section from silo, captioned "RADAR TV"] Today Russia is 
reaping the fruits of the most critical period of its military 
policy when, as a result of cuts in military production, it was 
forced to extend the guaranteed period of service of nuclear 
missiles on alert duty. Consequently, the safe service life of 
30 percent of these missiles has already expired. And another 
30 percent will turn into a potential nuclear threat in two 
years' time. Russia is faced with the task of scrapping more 
than 20,000 nuclear munitions by the year 2000. And since the 
pace of the salvage process is very slow, we may again fall 
hostages to the nuclear threat, but this time because of being 
incapable of carrying out mass industrial salvaging of such a 
vast quantity of nuclear charges. 
  [071315] The radiation background at the launch site is only 
just above the permissible limit [video shows counter reading]. 
Furthermore, all the operations are controlled by several 
specialists simultaneously. Therefore the removal of the nose 
section at the launch site is by no means the most dangerous 
operation. 
  [071331] [video shows operations above ground and detailed 
view of interior of missile silo] 
  [071332 thru 071405 -- passage omitted showing officer 
issuing instructions on safety precautions during nose section 
removal] 
  [071406 thru 071514 -- video shows nose section removal 
operation over largely unintelligible exchanges between officers] 
  [071515 thru 071603 -- passage omitted showing Aleksandr 
Gribov, unit commander, to camera, on safety of handling and 
dispatch of nose sections] 
  [071604] [Unit Commander A. Gribov, identified by caption 
earlier, over video of site being guarded by a soldier, sign 
reading "Mines," nose section being loaded onto truck] It has 
to be said that this is by no means the least important or worst 
of our weapons. Fortunately, it has never been used in 
practice. But the tests that were carried out showed that both 
the missile and the warheads are excellent and highly effective. 
  [071648] [video shows soldier guarding site, nose section 
being loaded onto a truck, partly over sinister music] 
  [071649] [Correspondent over closeup of nose section being 
loaded onto truck] The nuclear nose cone of the SS-18 missile 
can carry 10 nuclear warheads. At the moment there is nothing 
to compare with it in the world. 
  This unusual cargo will be carried in this neat truck only 
as 
far as the nearest depot. Before entering the industrial 
salvaging process, it has a difficult journey along worn-out 
Russian roads ahead. 
  [O71713] [video shows warhead being loaded, truck on the 
move] 
  [071714 thru 071741 -- passage omitted showing Aleksandr 
Volkov, first deputy commander in chief of Strategic Missile 
Forces, to camera, on safety regulations governing handling and 
storage of nuclear munitions] 
  [071742] [Aleksandr Volkov, first deputy commander in chief 
of Strategic Missiles Forces, identified by caption earlier, 
over video of missiles on railroad platforms in a siding in 
snowy location] We have established two bases for scrapping 
missiles, the Surovatikha base, and Pibanshur near the city of 
Izhevsk. 
  [O71805] [video shows missiles in railroad siding, concrete 
building in the middle distance, closeups of missiles on 
railroad platforms, partly over sinister music] 
  [071806] [Correspondent over video of missiles being 
dismantled in large hangar] Pibanshur and Surovatikha are 
Russia's first bases for scrapping ICBM's using resource-saving 
technologies. Following the removal of the dangerous fuel 
components, each SS-17 and SS-18 missile will be carefully 
dismantled. In this way the Surovatikha base will be able to 
scrap more than 40 heavy missiles a year. This means that 
thousands of tonnes of expensive metals and alloys will be 
returned to industry. 
  As is known, the previous class of missiles -- intermediate- 
and shorter-range missiles -- were scrapped by means of 
explosions. To the general amazement of our compatriots, 
billions of rubles were turned into ashes and smoke, quite apart 
from the damage that was done to the environment. This is why 
the two new enterprises -- which, incidentally, have been set up 
by the missile forces themselves within their department -- 
unquestionably mark a long-overdue step toward savings of state 
resources spent on disarmament. 
  For the time being inadequate funding is hampering the 
entire 
federal program for recycling ecologically dangerous materials 
from scrapped weapons. The Surovatikha base could make up this 
shortage of funds through the sale of part of the salvaged 
materials to other enterprises for processing. But the latter 
do not have any money either. 
  While a search for coordinated action by the ministries and 
departments interested in industrial recycling is under way at 
the top, the missile men have to bear the full burden of this 
work themselves. [072009] [video shows detailed views of 
salvage operation with camera switching back to railroad siding 
at the end] 
  [072010 thru 072415 -- passage omitted on brief statements 
to 
camera by Volkov on safety regulations, START I and II 
provisions; video of silo being blown up with correspondent 
describing the economic disadvantages of this treaty obligation] 
  [072416] [Correspondent over video of an SS-18 on a truck, 
followed by computer graphics, captioned "RADAR-TV" and 
"VoyenTV"] To replace the multiple reentry vehicle missiles 
which are being scrapped, Russia is planning to build another 
multiple-warhead missile [mnogoblochnaya raketa] based on the 
SS-25. However, as distinct from the heavy SS-18 missile, the 
new missile cannot be guaranteed to penetrate the opponent's 
anti-missile defenses, since the SS-18 was capable of releasing, 
in addition to its 10 warheads, up to 1,000 false targets into 
orbit. Scientists at the Moscow Heat Technology Institute 
intend to make up for this forced minus-point in the design of 
the nose section of the new missile by making these missiles 
easily reequipable into the "Start" system which can be used for 
launches for scientific purposes either right now or in the 
event of arms reduction. Admittedly, the engineers and 
designers will have to find the money to further develop this 
project themselves in order to preserve the scientific potential 
of Russia's only institute of this kind. [072540]

<F P=106> [From the Slavyanka program of the Russian Defense Ministry] </F>
  [Excerpt] How many chemical weapons are there in Russia and 
are they being destroyed? A Slavyanka correspondent asked (Igor 
Vlasov), head of the public relations sector of the committee 
for (?conditional) problems about chemical and biological 
weapons under the Russian president. He said: 
  [Begin (Vlasov) recording] Russia inherited chemical weapons 
from the former USSR as follows: 40,000 [metric] tonnes of 
toxic substances, including 32,200 tonnes of organophosphoric 
toxic substances stored in aviation, missile, and artillery 
charges; and 7,700 tonnes of old skin-sensitive toxic substances 
dating back to World War I, that is, mustard gas, lewisite, and 
their mixtures. They are stored in boxes, containers, 
reservoirs, and so on. 
  Russia is not destroying chemical weapons because it has no 
industrial facilities for utilizing or destroying chemical 
weapons. [end recording] [passage omitted on announcer recalling 
the 1992 Paris convention on chemical weapons]

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Danilkin under the rubric "Private </F>
Investigation": "From Russia with a Nuclear Welcome. Do You Want 
a Bomb? No Problem"] 
  [Text] It is a commonplace that it takes 1 kg of uranium to 
produce one atom bomb. It is another matter that this is only 
raw material. And the bomb ends up with considerably less power 
than, for example, the one dropped on Hiroshima. And this 
depends largely on the degree of enrichment of the uranium. But 
the fact is that it works! 
  And now the information obtained in the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of Russia: During the past year several dozen thefts of 
uranium-235, uranium-238, and other radioactive substances from 
secret defense industry enterprises of the country have been 
registered. The figures for last year are being amended. In each 
case no less than 1 kg has been stolen, and most frequently they 
each take a piece weighing 4-6 kg. One more stipulation must be 
made here: We are speaking only about cases where the criminals 
were apprehended and the dangerous cargo confiscated. One could 
quite logically assume that we have not managed to arrest all 
the uranium thieves. And now attention: According to figures in 
the German press, as of today the FRG is investigating 150 
criminal cases involving illegal trade in radioactive 
substances. Law enforcement organs there assume that the lion's 
share of these substances migrated to Germany over the vast 
expanses of the once inviolable Union. But even that is not all. 
Let us not be idealists: In spite of German meticulousness and 
care, there is no doubt that this is only a certain part of the 
whole. The ones who failed. If there were no uranium smugglers 
who succeeded, this business would wither on the vine. The 
Russian nuclear business is three years old. Previously it was 
simply impossible. Now it is attractive to many. 
<H5>  May Dreams </H5>
  Last year Vladimir K. was still working in a large Moscow 
scientific research institute that dealt with problems of 
nuclear energy. On his way home from work he usually met his 
friend Aleksandr P., who was not employed anywhere and lived on 
odd-job earnings. In spite of the difference in their social 
positions, both of the young people were equally short of money. 
  When entertaining his friend, Vladimir frequently told him 
various stories from the institute to the effect that they 
practically have uranium coming out of their ears and nobody is 
worried about it. In his words, an equal if not a greater mess 
was being made in the neighboring associate enterprise, which is 
also secret and to which Vladimir also has access. One warm May 
evening the friends did not have enough money for beer and were 
dreaming about wealth. If there is uranium coming out of their 
ears, why not take advantage of an opportunity? This could be 
done best in the "P.O. box enterprises," at the associated 
enterprise. 
  ... In the middle of May Vladimir K. managed to steal a 4 kg 
chunk of uranium which, although it was considered to be only 
slightly enriched, still "gave off radiation." In order not to 
get a large dose, Vladimir wrapped what he had stolen in special 
foil and the placed it in an ordinary cellophane package. He 
boarded the commuter train and went home to Dedovsk near Moscow. 
He had no Geiger counter, so up to this point he did not know 
what kind of doses the other people in the car or he himself had 
received. 
  In Dedovsk the friends buried the package of uranium in a 
suburban forest and started to think about to whom and, the main 
thing, for how much they could sell the "bomb." The task was not 
that simple, and it was necessary to bring four more people from 
that same company in on it. Through joint efforts they managed 
to make connections with people who knew something about prices 
on the black market. It turned out that they should ask no less 
than $60,000 for this piece. By this time none of the six were 
working anywhere, the transaction promised good money, and they 
were already dreaming of a new life. 
  They began to look for a buyer. But from that moment, in the 
words of one of the operatives, "they began to suffer from an 
old affliction"--the fear of losing their wealth. They thought 
someone might find the package of uranium in the forest, so they 
dug it up and moved it to Dedovsk, where they hid it in a 
garage. Then they hid it again, in the garret of a residential 
building whose residents had no suspicion of the danger that 
threatened them. 
  Their search for a buyer lasted a half-year. In the words of 
the "nuclear" six, they would have sold the goods to anyone who 
would pay good money; they were not concerned about what 
happened to their product after that. It was considered 
axiomatic that the "bomb" would interest foreigners and 
therefore they looked for contacts with them. The business even 
reached drivers of heavy trucks from the Baltic region. But 
after hearing the proposals, the majority of the Baltic 
residents stepped on the gas, and the few who did agree to buy 
paid a miserly price. Ultimately the zealous activity of the six 
was noticed by the regional administration for fighting 
organized crime. Experienced operatives from the Moscow suburb 
Krasnogorsk watched the group for three weeks and then arrested 
them. A special group assigned to work with radioactive 
substances was called to confiscate the stolen uranium. 
  When the leader of the operations group spoke with the 
official representative of the enterprise the 4 kg of uranium 
had come from, he stated that "every mouse is accounted for 
around here." To which the Krasnogorsk militiaman responded: 
"Maybe a mouse cannot get by you, but 4 kg of uranium were 
stolen from you." 
<H5>  Our Country Is Large... </H5>
  A militia colonel and deputy department head of the Main 
Administration for Economic Crimes of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of Russia, Vitaliy Zus, confirmed to the correspondent 
that dozens of thefts of radioactive materials are registered 
here in a year. Of rare earth metals--hundreds. Traffic in 
radioactive materials is a sign of the times. We know the 
explanation for this kind of trafficking: the collapse of the 
Union, the conversion that has been started, economic confusion, 
and the liberal conditions on the borders that facilitate taking 
goods out. 
  In spite of all its cataclysms, Russia has remained a 
country 
with immense territories. With a great multitude of defense 
enterprises and the most diverse "P.O. Box enterprises" where 
radioactive elements and that same uranium are used. A demand 
for inexpensive radioactive substances has arisen among 
mysterious foreign consumers. But the conditions at the secret 
enterprises have remained the same. A worker of that same 
department of the Main Administration for Economic Crimes, 
militia Colonel Sergey Mayorov, noted that about 90 percent of 
the thefts of strategic raw material can be explained by the 
possibility of free access, including for people from the 
outside. And also there are all kinds of violations of rules for 
accounting for and storing raw material. 
  The stolen uranium and other radioactive substances are 
usually offered to foreigners or intermediaries who are able to 
travel abroad. Of course it is easiest to meet such people in 
large cities, in Moscow. Most frequently it is there, to its 
white stones, that the uranium trail extends. Where does it come 
from? From everywhere where there are defense "P.O. Box 
enterprises." And they are everywhere: Siberia, the Urals, 
Central Russia...but the Urals still take first prize in this 
matter. They are a real Klondike for "nuclear" thieves. 
  From existing data it is possible to compile a portrait of 
businessmen of this breed. Judging from the practice and thefts 
of radioactive substances, they work, as a rule, in groups, and 
not alone (people working alone are caught more easily). The 
group usually includes (along with "proletarians") middle-level 
technical managers and also some representatives of the 
leadership of the enterprise--in case they have to provide a 
cover at a dangerous moment or simply "not notice." Or put their 
signature on a document for writing materials off. Then the 
courier takes the commodity in a capsule to the capital, where 
the buyer is given the opportunity to take 1 gram of the 
substance for analysis. If the commodity meets his 
"standard"--the transaction is completed according to the 
classical formula of "commodity-dollars." One well-informed 
person told a correspondent that if the buyer thinks of 
violating the gentleman's agreement, he is punished by death. 
This person even confirmed that the ones trapped by the militia, 
as a rule, are "people working on their own or terrible 
dilettantes." 
  Reality convinces us that what he said is true. A department 
chief of the Economic Crimes Administration of the Moscow City 
Internal Affairs Administration, Boris Blontsev, told about one 
such case. In a closed compound in Chelyabinsk Oblast 4.5 kg of 
a substance containing uranium-235 was stolen from a defense 
enterprise. The thief managed to successfully cover his tracks 
and soon he was on his way to Moscow with his mysterious parcel. 
The lone thief had no idea of whom to offer his parcel to or how 
many thousands of dollars to ask for it. Ultimately he ended up 
in a meeting with a buyer who turned out to be...a militia 
worker. Workers of law enforcement organs think that the single 
person from Chelyabinsk had practically no chance of succeeding. 
<H5>  Seize the Moment! </H5>
  While preparing this article I had occasion several times to 
see various consultants. All of them agreed with the opinion 
that a dangerous time had come and it is becoming advantageous 
and almost safe to engage in trade in semimanufactured nuclear 
products. 
  Quite recently a tonne of titanium could be purchased in 
Russia for 350 rubles [R] and then shipped abroad, where one 
could obtain $7,500 for it and buy household electronic 
equipment there, and then take it home and sell it for a 
fantastic profit. More than one Russian has become a billionaire 
from such speculations...prices of rare metals in Russia are now 
approaching world prices, and buying and selling them can 
produce a solid income, especially if they are shipped 
contraband, that is, if you do not pay for licenses, quotas, etc. 
  Not long ago investigators from Moscow confiscated seven 
ampules of cesium--a total of 1,550 g. When they brought it to 
an academician for consultation he was amazed: Never before in 
his life had he seen all at once seven ampules of cesium, 1 kg 
of which costs $50,000. Half joking, the academician said that: 
"He had an atomic bomb lying on his desk at that time." In 
certain circumstances, cesium can be extremely explosive. 
  Specialists from law enforcement organs think that there is 
another, possibly the strongest, precondition for smart "nuclear 
dealers," and one might call this precondition this: state 
feebleness. 
  Until recently any accident involving radioactive substances 
came mainly under the purview of the KGB. This information was 
systematized, analyzed, and immediately sent up to the very top. 
KGB people played first fiddle in all kinds of "P.O. Box 
enterprises." 
  A couple of days ago I phoned the corresponding service of 
the former Ministry of Security and asked for information on the 
countries to which stolen radioactive substances go from Russia. 
A day later the official representative reported: The Department 
has no information on this subject. That is, it does not know. 
One can perhaps believe this answer too: The Department has not 
had time for this recently. 
  I received a similar answer from the Russian customs 
service: 
"It seems that there are such cases, but they are individual and 
are no big deal." Most likely this answer can be accepted as 
well. But when you recall the endless Russian borders which are 
now called penetrable...the customs service is up to its neck in 
work and there is simply no possibility of keeping track of many 
regions. 
  In circles close to the government one most frequently 
encounters this position: "The problem of the sale of stolen 
semimanufactured products for an atomic bomb abroad is 
fabricated, we know nothing about this." And could it be that 
the militiamen who encountered criminals of this kind were 
really just exaggerating because they were afraid? And who would 
let it enter their mind to risk their health in this way even 
for dollars? 
  According to information from the Ministry of Justice of 
Russia, articles concerning the theft and attempts to sell 
radioactive materials were introduced into the Criminal Code 
back in 1988. But during 1988 and 1989 not one person in Russia 
was convicted under these articles. In 1990 one was convicted. 
Then for two years in a row there was silence, and in the first 
half of 1993--there were 12 individuals. We have no figures for 
the second half of the year yet. 
  We managed to obtain this information from unofficial but 
reliable sources: When investigating criminal cases involving 
the theft of radioactive substances they manage to arrest only 
every tenth criminal. And this certainly does not mean that his 
case is necessarily taken to court. As a rule, they use a 
multitude of intermediaries and also couriers to transport the 
material--people who have no idea of the content of their cargo. 
But even if a person is caught red-handed, his first words will 
usually be: "I found it." Or: "I bought it from somebody I did 
not know." Just try to find where it all ends. 
  Information from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia: 
During 11 months of last year 8,793 crimes involving all kinds 
of strategic raw material (including radioactive substances) 
were committed in the country. In spite of the numerous official 
appeals from law enforcement organs to the government for help 
and the various committees and other levels of authority, no 
reaction followed. Which in translation can mean: "Catch them 
yourselves!" 
<H5>  A Bomb for... </H5>
  And now the main question: Where does the river of uranium 
flow from Russia? For now we know for certain that our 
compatriots do not intend to make and keep a private atom bomb. 
But is the final destination of these exports Europe? 
  From the majority of my consultants who had at least in some 
way been involved with the problem of uranium and similar 
substances I most frequently heard this address: the Near East. 
  According to certain information, emissaries are sent to 
Russia, forming the demand and prices on our uranium black 
market. They say that unofficial Iraq has long shown an interest 
in goods of this kind. Evil tongues even assert that there are 
chunks from the Urals in the atom bomb that they are now 
assembling. But officials so far do not want to either confirm 
or deny these assumptions. 
  Paradoxical as it may be, a circumstance that significantly 
complicates the fight against theft of radioactive raw material 
is the coincidence of the interests of the "uranium" criminals 
and those who...are responsible for the safety of our 
radioactive reserves: Both are interested in remaining silent. 
Neither one side nor the other wishes to risk their own necks. 
Not until a critical mass has accumulated.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 9 TASS -- High prices and low wages 
force some Russians to go stealing... radioactive materials to 
resell them later for profit in order to make both ends meet. 
  Last year alone, there were 11 attempts to steal uranium 
from 
Russian nuclear facilities, according to Yuriy Yefimov, head of 
the Department for the Protection of Strategic State Facilities 
of the Russian Interior Ministry troops. 
  Speaking at a conference of the Russian Interior Ministry 
senior officials in Moscow on Wednesday, Yefimov said that law 
enforcement bodies reported about 900 attempts of illegal 
penetration into secret nuclear facilities in 1993. In 700 
cases their employees were caught while trying to smuggle out 
secret documents. 
  Experts of the Russian Ministry of the Nuclear Power 
Industry 
tend to blame the stealings on the worsening economic situation 
in the country which forces people to resort to extreme measures 
in order to eke out their existence. 
  Experts claim that the thefts of radioactive materials are 
carried out by people who know technology as their own palms. 
This opinion was shared by Yefimov who said that one of the 
attempts to steal uranium and smuggle it out of the country was 
made by a group of employees of one of the secret plants near 
the city of Yekaterinburg, the Urals region, which included some 
of its top officials.

materials are also becoming a source of profit for market 
businessmen. In Obninsk staffers of the organized crime 
administration of the Kaluga Internal Affairs Administration 
came across the vice president of one of those commercial firms 
with a fashionable foreign name and discovered that he had a 
container of uranium-235 in his possession. It is no secret 
that this product is used as fuel for nuclear reactors and thus 
commands a high price. A further search led to the city of 
Elektrostal in Moscow Oblast, where the vice president's brother 
was employed at an enterprise. He had 30 times more uranium in 
his possession than his Obninsk brother. According to one 
account, this valuable fuel might have been destined for the 
Near East or Germany.

  [Text] [Parfenenkov over video of city street, bus] The 
people of Krasnoyarsk-26, a city which until now was closed to 
everybody except for taiga inhabitants and those sent there to 
work, have finally undertaken to share events close to their 
hearts with the outside world. The world's first nuclear heat 
and power station is 30 years old. To this day, it faithfully 
supplies heat to the homes of this beautiful city with its 
100,000-strong population on the right bank of the Yenisey 
River. The power plant is located deep down under the rocks. 
The tunnels forged there are adorned in marble in many places, 
and they rival the St. Petersburg subway in terms of length. 
But let's be honest about this -- it is not for the sake of a 
fairly modest nuclear power generator that people dug their way 
into the rockface.... 
  [P.G. Gusakov, nuclear heat and electric power station 
chief, 
identified by caption] In this city most people work at the 
Mining and Chemical Combine, which belonged to the defense 
sector and the nuclear complex, and its task was to produce 
weapons-grade plutonium. 
  [Parfenenkov] Krasnoyarsk-26 still has the capacity to make 
a lot more of this stuff that goes into nuclear weapons, but the 
demand is no longer there. So what will the people of the city 
do? Work to alter the quality of the weapons-grade plutonium is 
under way. Henceforth it will be used as fuel -- that same fuel 
which has provided heat for the last 30 years, and which will 
continue to keep the city in the Krasnoyarsk taiga warm into the 
future. [Video shows view of city, interior of power station,

<F P=106> [From the "Top Secret" program: Video report entitled "The </F>
Nuclear Button" by Artem Borovik, identified by caption; figures 
in brackets denote broadcast time in GMT in hours, minutes, and 
seconds] 
  [Excerpts] [192245 thru 192420 -- introductory passage 
omitted] 
  [192420] [Borovik over video of himself accompanied by two 
others, one in uniform, arriving at missile base] A few weeks 
ago our camera crew visited a Russian nuclear missile base 
located a few hours' traveling time from Moscow. We traveled 
first by train and then by military helicopter, and finally we 
arrived at the launch site, where an SS-17 missile with a 
multiple warhead is concealed in a silo. It is targeted on the 
Warren U.S. nuclear missile base located near the city of 
Cheyenne in Wyoming State -- the headquarters of (Dirk 
Jamieson), a U.S. 3-star general who commands land-based 
strategic missile forces. This missile would take 30 minutes to 
reach Warren base. 
  General Gribov, commander of this Russian missile division, 
descended with our camera crew to his underground labyrinth, 
which is well protected against the consequences of a nuclear 
explosion. It is possible to descend even further to reach the 
combat control console, from which 10 missiles can be launched, 
one of which we have just seen. [video shows Borovik proceeding 
along an underground corridor. An overhead inscription reads: 
"Command Post of Military Unit No. 14264"] The officers on 
duty here spend hundreds of hours a year in these nuclear 
underground corridors. Every time before they come on duty they 
have to pass a test to demonstrate their precise knowledge of 
the functioning of this equipment and the sequence of all their 
actions. They also have to undergo thorough medical and 
psychiatric tests several times a year, and routine checks prior 
to every duty tour. The fate of our planet is in these people's 
hands. They are not told where their missiles are targeted. 
Division Commander General Gribov also prefers not to know, 
although he is fully entitled to this knowledge. When a launch 
command goes out, our missile men know exactly how to 
distinguish between a training command and a combat command, 
while U.S. officers on duty at similar consoles are not told by 
their commanders which is a training command and which is for 
real. 
  Such missile army divisions are scattered throughout Russia 
and also Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Invisible nerves 
link them to a single nuclear center which is located a 
25-minute drive from the Triumphal Arch [video show arch) to the 
west of Moscow at a place called Vlasikha. The missile men told 
us that in the last century there was an estate here whose owner 
was popularly known as "Vlasikha." Only a few years ago these 
roads and traffic along them were controlled by our 
counterintelligence. Outsiders could not pass here without 
being stopped. 
  This whole vast nuclear mechanism of the former Soviet Union 
comprising many thousands of land-based missiles is under the 
command of Colonel General Igor Sergeyev, commander in chief of 
the Strategic Missile Forces. [192700] [video shows missile

  [Text] Thousands of Russians live in localities affected by 
a U.S.-style Agent Orange chemical tested there in the 1960's 
and 1970's, president of the pressure group for chemical 
security Lev Fedorov told Interfax. 
  He is the co-author of a 1992 newspaper article together 
with 
chemical scientist Vil Mirzayanov on Russia's development of 
binary weapons leading to the latter's arrest on charges of 
divulging a state secret. 
  Fedorov who is one of the witnesses in a closed trial in 
Moscow, says that there is still a shroud of secrecy not only 
about new generation weapons but also obsolete toxic agents 
which are no longer produced or have been destroyed either in 
part or in full. 
  Thousands of tons of the Agent Orange type chemical weapons 
were produced at a chemical plant in Ufa between 1965 and the 
late 1970's, Fedorov said. 
  He spoke of having evidence that the weapons were tested in 
the Primorskiy, Krasnoyarsk and Krasnodar regions and in the 
northern Caucasus. These must have been sprayed but the 
government is still reluctant to declassify the secret 
information, Fedorov said. 
  In his words, decomposition of the weapons leads to the 
formation of dioxins, a substance that is hazardous to human 
health.

<F P=106> [Article by Abram Blokh, doctor of geological and </F>
mineralogical sciences: "The Secret of the Kodar Sobakita"] 
  [Text] The secrecy classification has been removed 
from information about the search for and extraction of uranium. 
Anyone who has worked for decades in this mysterious field 
feels, together with relief and a feeling of bitterness, that 
too many years have been spent in a routine of prohibitions and 
inflexible restrictions. 
  I will not undertake to judge the advisability of the 
decisions made a half century ago--the all-embracing 
classification of that vast body of human and physical resources 
which was put into effect at the dawn of the atomic problem. I 
know only that not one of the countries outside the socialist 
camp has taken such a step. We must think that we are not the 
last ones for purely economic reasons, in order to avoid the 
huge unproductive expenditures, to maintain an army of 
protectors and the inevitable informers in secret matters. All 
the same, the leak of information is already substantial when 
there are two who bring it instead of one, unless they are truly 
isolated from the outside world, of course. But hundreds of 
thousands, if not millions of people, have been counted here. 
  In 1954, when a program of searches for uranium was 
undertaken on a wide scale, a geological technician with a 
radiation meter joined our coal geological exploration party in 
Ryazan Oblast. And in the core sample of one of the boreholes 
selected for measurement, in a plain layer of clay on the side 
of the coal-bearing area, a high concentration of uranium was 
suddenly discovered. Soon after, controlled drilling was begun 
under conditions of strict secrecy. The trust employees stood 
watch at the drills and collected and documented the cores, and 
we just provided the drilling process. To the puzzled questions 
why we were drilling where there is obviously no coal and in a 
system that was unprecedentedly dense, the response was for the 
needs of the trust, "but I do not know what kind." While the 
slyly smiling drilling foreman once revealed that his mother had 
brought home a tale from the market that geologists had found an 
"atom" under the village of Zheltukhino. 
  How can we help but remember the immortal adage, over 
200 years old, uttered by the observant Madam de (Stal) after a 
trip to our country: "In Russia everything is a mystery and 
nothing is a secret." The instructional song of the miner 
leaving for a health resort could also have been included in the 
Vysotskiy repertoire by the head of the first division of the 
uranium mine. Quiet Yakov Davidovich Gotman, an honored figure 
in science and technology, one of the pioneers of Soviet uranium 
geology and discoverer of the unique Aldan uranium mining area 
in southern Yakutia, has recounted the absolutely fantastic 
story about the information leak. In the late 1940's, he was 
sent along with S. Yershov, the deputy minister of geology, and 
his colleague B. Petrushevskiy, to Central Asia on assignment. 
On the next day, the "Voice of America" reported the departure 
of three specialists from Moscow for the Central Asian uranium 
deposits. 
  After the country acquired its atomic and thermonuclear 
weapons, through the selfless labor of its specialists and with 
a little help from the prospectors who were just as selfless, 
and was able to stockpile enough of them to annihilate all life 
on the planet, secrecy in the geology of atomic raw material was 
turned into an indisputable absurdity. But the screws were 
tightened even more. 
  In the first decades of the uranium boom a researcher 
working 
in the atomic energy field could publish scientific works which 
did not deal with uranium with all the publication data, 
including the name of the organization in which he was working. 
But if reference was made to articles on uranium geology, 
mention of the subject of one's research and its geographical 
location, as well as one's place of work, was prohibited. The 
routine of a scientific institution was also considered a big 
state secret, and Anatoliy Shcheranskiy, as we know, paid with a 
13-year sentence in the camps at the end of the Brezhnev era for 
allegedly divulging such information. 
  From the mid-1970's, after achieving parity with the United 
States, the ban on indicating one's place of work was extended 
to all scientists who were working with uranium. Even if the 
author of a completely harmless article did not mention uranium 
in previously published works. Even when secrets which they 
endeavored to safeguard were lost because of circumstances, this 
did not stop those in control of universal secrecy. After the 
Prague spring was smothered, the head of uranium geology in 
Czechoslovakia, Vladimir Ruzhechka, did not return home. In a 
book published in Canada in the mid-1970's, he revealed the 
uranium resources not only of Eastern Europe, but the Soviet 
Union as well. But like a mosquito which continues sucking blood 
by inertia when its belly has been cut off, so the illuminated 
skyscraper of domestic secrecy has continued to increase the 
number of its stories. 
  The closed nature of the sector was convenient for the 
uranium barons to a large extent, making it easier to pump huge 
budget appropriations into it. The overexploration of deposits, 
linked chiefly with the faulty planning system, which is 
inconceivable in other countries, is typical for Soviet geology 
as a classic cost-based branch of the economy of socialism. 
Wages and bonuses depended not on specific results, but the 
running meters of drilling, the cubic meters penetrated, and so 
forth. Thus the effectiveness of geological exploration 
operations turned out to be less advantageous for collectives 
than increasing their volumes. 
  It is unlikely that the almost unknown venture involving the 
mobilization of vast sums and numbers of people in completely 
unprepared searches for uranium in the Kodar Range in 
northeastern Chita Oblast would have been possible without 
absolute secrecy. Based only on a highly radioactive piece of 
rock with absolutely no geographical connection (such specimens 
are called "sobakity" in geological terminology) which was sent 
to Moscow, they quickly sent out two camps of prisoners into the 
unpopulated high mountains under severe conditions in the late 
1940's, and urgently put together a specialized geological 
exploration expedition and a second expedition to conduct 
scientific support for the operations, organized from scientific 
associates of the Leningrad Geological Institute, who were to 
remain at the site the year round. At the same time, they 
shipped out heavy equipment and began drilling, tunneling, and 
so forth in an area that had been given absolutely no geological 
study. In the wilderness of the mountainous taiga, out of touch 
with communications, the prisoners immediately began erecting 
the buildings of a new town. The materials needed were taken in 
by a winter road, and by aircraft the remainder of the year. The 
results turned out to be poor--at the cost of much effort and 
many lives, they found only a number of small signs of ore, 
unsuitable for industrial exploitation. 
  The army of specialists who provided their intellect and 
hard 
labor and often lost their health to develop the country's 
uranium base were the victims of this secrecy. They were 
prohibited from traveling abroad, even to "fraternal countries," 
and from contacts and correspondence with foreign colleagues, 
which scientists need like a person needs air. Without 
convincing explanations, authorization to participate in 
international conferences could be refused, even when they took 
place in the USSR, and even when personally invited with a paper 
which did not lead to complaints. 
  When my article on important aspects of the theory of ore 
formation, whose conclusions were based on Ilya Prigozhin's 
assumptions about the lack of equilibrium in thermodynamics, 
appeared in one of the scientific journals, I decided to send a 
reprint to the Nobel laureate and soon after received a warm 
letter from him, a copy of his last monograph, and an invitation 
to visit him at the institute in Brussels. 
  Dreams about a trip were obviously illusory at that time. 
But 
it would really be up-to-date for an outstanding scientist of 
modern times to publish support for his scientific ideas. It was 
during those very years of exhausting opposition from the 
powerful (not in number, but opportunities) group of scientific 
opponents headed by V. A. Zharikov, the current 
academician-secretary of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences], 
who was no less omnipotent then as the chairman of the VAK 
[Higher Degree Commission] and who successfully blocked my 
certification for the doctor of sciences degree for almost 20 
years. 
  Nevertheless, I preferred to remain silent, for the fact 
that 
I had exchanged letters with a foreign scientist could have been 
harmful. 
  The restrictions on movement and contacts were imposed on 
participants in the American atomic project as well. But unlike 
our bureaucracy, these restrictions were extended equally to 
everyone, from Robert Oppenheimer, the head of the project, to 
the ordinary technician. But our uranium "generals," who 
possessed incomparably greater information under the "secret" 
classification, very calmly traveled throughout the world. The 
wives of the high officials working in the uranium field also 
had the same privileges. 
  The Americans were generously compensated with additional 
payments for the inconveniences related to the restrictions. 
Additional payment "for secrecy" was also stipulated for Soviet 
uranium employees by some ancient classified government decrees. 
But in accordance with the classicial laws of the Kingdom of 
Distorting Mirrors, the payments were received by the directors, 
their deputies, chief accountants, and employees of the first 
divisions, that is, the ones who forgot long ago how to hold a 
geologist's hammer--or never did know how, or how to walk the 
hills and dales with a radiation meter and through mine 
workings, or to study the radioactive rocks under a microscope. 
  The farfetched secrecy, in accordance with the laws of 
feedback, has hit the system which gave rise to it as well. 
There is a wide conviction that the criminals sentenced to death 
are not shot but sent to the uranium mines, where they soon die. 
This is all a fantasy. Throughout my working life I have spent 
innumerable shifts underground not only in uranium mines, but 
coal, cobalt, molybdenum, and gold workings as well. I am 
prepared to attest to the fact that I never encountered more 
comfortable conditions than in uranium mines. A well organized 
and strictly controlled ventilation system that provides for 
work safety, workings at one's full height, not manholes for 
"abdominal movement," and a large number of showers on the 
surface, maintained in model sanitary condition... 
  Of course, the all-powerful Minsredmash [Ministry of Medium 
Machine Building] was not ashamed to make use of the convicts' 
forced labor on a wide scale. But just in construction and 
auxiliary operations. The prisoners were not underground. They 
were not needed there, and the uranium mines did not experience 
a shortage of a mining work force. Many were attracted there by 
the exemplary work conditions, the higher earnings, and the 
well-equipped housing with which the ministry's towns and 
settlements were always provided. In addition, the radioactivity 
of even the rich natural ores is incomparable with the enriched 
uranium from the reactors of nuclear power stations, the deadly 
radiation which is erroneously attributed to the mines. If one 
is looking for places suitable for prisoners condemned to death, 
one should look in the coal mines, with their unacceptably low 
level of safety equipment. 
  But what comes with the declassification of uranium, aside 
from a belated quiet satisfaction? Its features as a more 
"cosmopolitan" environment than other ores help to "get into" 
the general natural laws of ore formation. So the tens of 
thousands of volumes of handwritten reports by Soviet uranium 
workers with the most extensive information, which continue to 
remain behind the steel doors of the geological funds, are truly 
the property of world science. The titanic intellectual labor of 
several generations of specialists, which is capable of standing 
up to the competition in any market of scientific knowledge, is 
concentrated in them. The only question is whether we are really 
able to enter these steel doors.

<F P=106> [Olga Musafirova report: "May We Join?.. The Ukrainian </F>
Parliament Will No Longer Stymie the Nuclear Disarmament of the 
State"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- It was simply a crushing victory for Leonid 
Kravchuk. Once again he mixed his supporters and opponents 
together in the Supreme Council to produce new political loaves 
in the way that a good housewife kneads dough. Leonid 
Makarovich listened carefully first to the microphone on the 
left which promised him the Nobel Peace Prize and then to the 
microphone on the right which threatened him with Article 56 of 
the Criminal Code for treason on a specially large scale. And 
all this for a three-page statement by the presidents of 
Ukraine, the United States, and Russia delivered in Moscow on 14 
January. 
  Meanwhile the stove had been lit and the loaves knew that 
they would have to leap into it. Ukraine's nuclear weapons are 
-- thanks to the economic policy of the last two years -- the 
only commodity which the West has dreamed of buying here, buying 
in order to destroy them. 
  However, the Supreme Council was required not to sign but, 
on 
the contrary, to erase something, to strike out its so-called 
"warnings" over an article in Protocol Five of the START Treaty 
as enshrined by decree in November 1993 so that the document was 
not at odds with the three-page statement of the presidents 
which had already been agreed upon. 
  The situation was lent special piquancy by the fact that the 
"Moscow pact" -- neither the statement itself nor the appendices 
to it containing specific figures and deadlines for Ukraine's 
nuclear disarmament -- did not need ratification at all. And 
the debates in parliament guaranteed their participants profound 
moral satisfaction only. 
  Leonid Makarovich bore the blows of fate in worthy fashion. 
He forgave his attackers: "I understand it is a difficult 
decision for you to make..." He encouraged those who thought 
like him: "I received a letter from Clinton at lunchtime. He 
writes that he is doubling economic aid to Ukraine." True, the 
real issues remained off stage: The questions of interest to 
the technicians and professionals like Kuchma of how modern 
solid-fuel SS-24 missiles are going to be scrapped if the 
technology for recycling them does not yet exist in the world; 
who will solve the problem of utilizing weapons-grade plutonium; 
what to do with the abandoned missile silos, and so forth. A 
purely political rather than a comprehensive approach to nuclear 
disarmament can only result in either blatant deception of the 
whole world or upheaval within the Ukrainian state system. But 
the president was as good as his word: He exerted his influence 
and led people toward a compromise. 
  With just a couple of minutes to go before the end of the 
working day parliament was persuaded that it was being taken 
into account, established a quorum, and pushed the "yes" button. 
Unconditional ratification of START I was carried. The new 
decree was prepared by the president himself as a legislative 
initiative. True, during voting the third paragraph -- on 
accession to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons of 1 July 1968 -- got unexpectedly dropped: Someone 
remembered that deputies had not actually seen the document 
themselves, which was inconvenient.... Therefore Ukraine has not 
subscribed to it, although it now wished to!

<F P=106> [Question and answer session with Ukrainian President Leonid </F>
Kravchuk by deputies, following speech by Kravchuk on nuclear 
issues at Supreme Council session in Kiev -- live] 
  [Text] Dorohuntsov, not further identified: 
Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, I know that you signed the statement 
and an appendix to this statement, which is not very simple and 
is not very easy for Ukraine. I believe that you were forced to 
do so. That was a political decision which will have very 
important consequences for Ukraine, and you have probably 
assessed these consequences. I support your stand and I will 
vote in its favor. Unfortunately, I believe that we do not have 
an alternative. 
  However, I have the following question for you. As is known, 
our disarmament -- the technical details are up to specialists 
and we are not specialists -- requires significant expenditures. 
What will Ukraine's share -- if there is no possibility to 
express it in absolute figures -- of these expenditures be, and 
what will the share of the so-called world community be? This 
is a very serious question for us. I think here we could do our 
best to take as much as possible; unfortunately, it is not us 
who make these decisions unilaterally. So, I would only like 
you to express your opinion on this matter. In addition, it 
would possibly be good if this brief discussion of ours is 
broadcast in full. Thanks for your reply. 
  Kravchuk: True, when a resolution is being adopted 
in this hall, or some law, we try to write down in it our 
maximum needs and our maximum benefits, and this can be 
understood. And when the law or some resolution is implemented, 
and when more than one country -- and here three or four 
countries are involved -- compromises are inevitable, otherwise 
one would never adopt anything. Not to adopt a decision at a 
time when there is a Supreme Council resolution and to drive 
this problem into a blind corner would mean extremely grave 
consequences and a threat to the security of Ukraine, and not 
only Ukraine. 
  I underscore that I was guided by the reservations, which is 
the main thing. Second, in order for you to understand, I was 
guided not by the pressure which was applied and which always 
exists, but by the realities facing Ukraine. And the realities, 
which I have already told you about, are these: Today Ukraine 
cannot safely maintain and service the nuclear weapons which we 
inherited. These weapons are becoming obsolete and pose a 
threat to us. If one fails to understand this, the rest is 
derivative. If we act appropriately, others will adopt an 
appropriate attitude toward us. As far as specific expenditures 
are concerned, relevant calculations are already available. 
Both the United States and the European community already say 
that the financial aid figures for dismantling the nuclear 
weapons will be doubled. 
  Second [as heard], the warheads will be dismantled in 
Russia, 
and Ukraine will be compensated for them according to world 
prices, less the expenditure for their dismantling. 
  The next steps connected with silos and launcher vehicles 
will be agreed upon on the basis of other agreements to be 
worked out on the basis of the resolution. This is because 
there are problems here. We cannot blow up the silos because 
they are located in densely populated areas. However, these 
issues will be stipulated in other agreements. Today the talk 
is about the fundamental decisions and about those fundamental 
decisions which the Supreme Council reservations dealt with, and 
we are trying to implement them. 
  Yakheyeva: Tetyana Yakheyeva, Electoral District 
No. 438. First, I have a procedural comment to make on the 
president's legislative initiative. This probably relates to 
the lawyers that he consulted. Leonid Makarovych said that he 
submitted to the Supreme Council a draft resolution on the 
accession of Ukraine to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. 
The treaty itself, however, was not submitted to the Supreme 
Council. I would like everyone to know about this. This is 
like adopting a resolution bringing a law into effect, with the 
law itself having not been under consideration. 
  Second, esteemed Leonid Makarovych, I have several very 
short 
questions. The following situation has arisen on the issue of 
nuclear weapons: Our executive power is governed exclusively by 
statements and declarations, being purely political documents, 
and pays no heed whatsoever to resolutions and laws adopted in 
Ukraine, or to its military doctrine or foreign policy. This is 
why I have this question to you: Do you think the implementation 
of this trilateral statement is obligatory for executive power? 
  The second question is this: What agreements were concluded 
during the negotiations on the fulfilment of the reservations? 
For example, was any agreement concluded on the civilian use of 
silo launchers, compensation, or anything else? Was it or was 
it not? 
  Finally, the last question: According to the foreign media, 
which writes in the words of members of the American delegation, 
some secret accords were reached during these negotiations, the 
contents of which will forever remain unknown to anyone. Were 
such accords reached or is it untrue? Thank you. 
  Kravchuk: I would like to start from the end. A 
package of all the documents which were signed was published. 
Other protocol records related to purely technical matters 
rather than, shall we say, any issues of principle, because it 
is about elimination, withdrawal, their procedure, character, 
the timetable, and so on, and not about political documents, 
which would be of an obligatory nature and which were published 
in the press. In other words, what you are probably referring 
to is these protocol records. I cannot say anything else, I 
have not read it, so unfortunately I do not know what the press 
writes about. 
  Is the statement of an obligatory nature? The statement is 
of an obligatory nature in that we now -- except, shall we say, 
that we, on the basis of existing reservations and of the 
Supreme Council's resolution -- can act accordingly, having 
implemented these reservations with regard to 36 and 42 percent 
of the missiles subject to elimination and reduction. We can 
act right now. So in this sense it is of an obligatory nature, 
because it corresponds with the Supreme Council's resolutions. 
It does correspond with it. 
  As for what you are saying about other agreements, I have 
already said that these issues are settled after decisions of 
principle are made. Then the issues of specific agreements, 
specific issues, are settled. They by all means will be made at 
governmental and inter- governmental level after being worked on 
by experts. This is a whole number of documents rather than one 
document.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Kiev UNIAR in Ukrainian at 1730 GMT on 3 
February carries a 350-word Ukraine Supreme Council resolution 
on the START I Treaty as follows: 
  "The Supreme Council of Ukraine has resolved:" 
  "1. Taking into account the specific measures taken by the 
president and Government of Ukraine regarding the implementation 
of the provisions of the Supreme Council resolution dated 18 
November 1993, and the steps to meet Ukraine half-way on the 
part of the United States and Russia, in order to remove the 
reservations regarding the article of the Protocol to the START 
Treaty signed in Lisbon on 23 May 1992." 
  "2. To charge the Government of Ukraine with carrying out 
the exchange of instruments of ratification of the START Treaty. 
  "3. To accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty dated 
1 July 1968, which will hereafter be termed the Treaty, as a 
state not owning nuclear weapons, with the following statement:" 
  "(1) Ukraine owns the components of the nuclear weapons that 
it inherited from the former USSR, and after the weapons have 
been dismantled and destroyed under its control, and in 
accordance with procedures that will rule out the possibility of 
reusing these weapons' components for the original purpose, 
Ukraine intends to use the material extracted from them 
exclusively for civilian purposes, in particular as fuel for 
Ukrainian AES [nuclear electric power station], or receive 
compensation for them;" 
  "(2) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] does not 
fully cover the unique situation that arose as a result of the 
disintegration of the USSR as a nuclear state. The presence of 
nuclear weapons on the territory of Ukraine until they are 
eliminated entirely, as well as appropriate activity to 
maintain, service, and eliminate them, does not contravene the 
provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty." 
  "(3) Ukraine will hold talks with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency with the aim of concluding agreements regarding 
the guarantees envisaged by the Treaty." 
  "(4) The violation of the territorial integrity or 
inviolability of Ukraine's borders on the part of any nuclear 
state will be viewed by Ukraine as a violation of the Treaty." 
  Kiev UNIAR in Ukrainian at 1900 GMT on 3 February then 
carried the following service message: 
  "The news agency RESPUBLIKA [UNIAR] apologizes for the 
incorrect information about the approval by the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council of the resolution on the fulfilment by Ukraine's 
president of the Supreme Council of Ukraine recommendations made 
during the ratification of the START I Treaty. The Supreme 
Council approved a resolution of two items:" 
  "1. Taking into account the specific measures taken by the 
president and Government of Ukraine regarding the implementation 
of the provisions of the Supreme Council resolution dated 18 
November 1993, and the steps to meet Ukraine half-way on the 
part of the United States and Russia, in order to remove the 
reservations regarding article of the Protocol to the START 
Treaty signed in Lisbon on 23 May 1992." 
  "2. To charge the Government of Ukraine with carrying out 
the exchange of instruments of ratification of the START Treaty. 
With this aim to step up the activity of the Government on 
concluding specific international agreements stemming from the 
reservations of the Supreme Council resolution on the 
ratification of the START I Treaty." 
  "Item 3 on Ukraine's accession to the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty was excluded from the resolution due to 
the fact that it was not discussed in Parliament. Deputy Sergey 
Golovatyy made a remark to the effect that Ukraine could not 
announce itself simultaneously a nuclear state while acceding to 
START I and a non-nuclear state while participating in the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Issues of compensation for 
the nuclear weapon components were touched upon with regard to 
the difference in prices for the fuel uranium on the U.S. 
internal and external market, etc. Deputies Sergey Golovatyy, 
Tetyana Yakheyeva, and Sergey Semenets proposed to discuss this 
in the standing commissions, and to then submit it for the 
consideration of the Supreme Council. After this the issue on 
accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will be 
solved."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy </F>
Shmarov by Olena Lisychna; place and date not given: "Ukraine's 
Last Nuclear Season" -- first two paragraphs are UKRAYINA MOLODA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who headed 
Ukraine's delegation to negotiations in Washington on the eve of 
the Moscow meeting, has indeed become a hero of Ukraine's last 
"nuclear" season. 
  For a while, the legislature has put aside discussion of the 
"nuclear" agreement. If the Supreme Council does not support 
the Moscow agreement, Ukraine will experience "hard days," 
claims Valeriy Shamarov. At the same time, Valeriy Shamarov 
does not support illusions that Ukraine will receive weighty 
credits and investments. However, he believes that even "small 
sums are better than nothing." 
  Lisychna: This "nuclear" history still has many 
white spots, and the issue of compensation for our tactical 
nuclear weapons is of extreme interest. 
  Shmarov: Indeed, for quite a long time, Russia did 
not agree to our demands for compensation. However, at the last 
stage of the negotiations, Russia recognized our ownership of 
the tactical nuclear weapons and we discussed, in general, forms 
of holding our mutual accounts. We will cancel part of our 
debts for energy resources by transferring these tactical 
nuclear weapons to Russia. In the first place, in my opinion, 
this is better than nothing. In the second place, Ukraine 
cannot enjoy equal partnership because it has amassed enormous 
debts to Russia. 
  Lisychna: Valeriy Mykolayovych, what part of our 
debt could be canceled? 
  Shmarov: The more the better. I estimate our 1993 
debts to Russia at $1 billion, while 1992 debts -- at $2.5 
billion. In my opinion, we could settle 50 percent of our 1993 
debts. 
  Well, the issue of strategic nuclear weapons is also very 
complicated. Economic calculations were based on data drawn 
from the worldwide uranium trade. The U.S. side will be a 
guarantor of the fulfillment of this agreement by the Russian 
party. A tripartite commission will draft the contract on this 
agreement in three-months time. 
  Lisychna: Who will pay for the processing of 
uranium in Russia? 
  Shmarov: This expense is included in the costs of 
Ukrainian deliveries to Russia. One more positive moment for 
Russia: Russia will be paid by the United States for each 
weapon dismantled on the territory of Ukraine. 
  Lisychna: Is this payment for work or a kind of 
moral support? 
  Shmarov: This moral support means big money. In 
general, the United States is deeply interested in the 
dismantlement of nuclear weapons because the missiles are still 
directed at the United States, despite the fact that the button 
is in Moscow. 
  Lisychna: For how long can our nuclear power 
plants work on the fuel which we are going to receive from 
Russia as part of our compensation? 
  Shmarov: Yearly, we require 100 tonnes of nuclear 
fuel. Currently, we are short of nuclear fuel. Our nuclear power 
plants could work for five to seven years on the fuel which will 
be delivered under the Moscow agreement. 
  Lisychna: Our legislature must adopt the START I 
and START II Treaties and Ukraine should sign the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty before the Moscow agreements can start 
being implemented.... 
  Shmarov: If these agreements are not implemented, 
Ukraine will experience hard times. We have held a series of 
consultations in the Supreme Council. The deputies understand 
the importance of these agreements. In addition, after the 
Supreme Council says "yes" or "no," we will have to draft nine 
agreements on compensation issues. I hope that the Supreme 
Council's decision on the issue will be positive. 
  Lisychna: On 25 January, IZVESTIYA published this 
report: "The second Chernobyl is under way. The dismantlement 
of old missiles in Ukraine has been stopped for an indefinite 
period due to the lack of military storage bases, transport, and 
material assets." Is this report true? 
  Shmarov: These facts are partially true. 
Currently, we lack containers and means of transport. However, 
the Moscow agreements foresee that Russia will provide us with 
equipment and means of transportation.... The Russian Defense 
Ministry will deliver everything on time.... In general, our 
agreement with Russia is based on mutual relations: We also 
deal with servicing of nuclear- armed SS-24 rocket launchers in 
Russia because they were produced in Ukraine. 
  Lisychna: Valeriy Mykolayovych, what about the sum 
of $2.8 billion? In late 1993, Ukraine demanded that this sum 
be earmarked for the dismantlement of its nuclear weapons. 
However, it turned out that this figure was also false. So, 
what sum does Ukraine currently require? 
  Shmarov: The figure of $2.8 billion is likely to 
be too big. In my opinion, we require more than $175 million or 
even $1.75 billion. Well, concerning the so-called U.S. 
financial aid, I insisted (even during my stay in Washington) 
that the United States should increase its aid within the 
framework of the Nunn-Lugar program. The U.S. side has promised 
this. It is more important for us to not receive consultations 
(we have our own experts) or a system of satellite 
communications, but modern equipment, diesel fuel, assets for 
social protection of servicemen, etc.... Or, simply put, our 
requirements are more practical. 
  Lisychna: Bill Clinton said at the Boryspil 
airport that Ukraine can use funds from the Nunn-Lugar program 
for purposes of conversion and defense.... 
  Shmarov: These means are miserable. As for 
conversion, we have signed an agreement between the Pentagon and 
the Ukrainian Ministry of Machine Building on the issue of 
cooperation in the sphere of conversion. This could be one more 
source of financial resources because we could draft projects in 
which Americans could become interested. 
  One more positive element of the Moscow agreement is the 
extension of our relations. Currently, our government 
delegation is working in the United States. Our economic 
cooperation with the United States currently stands at $500 
million. 
  Lisychna: Valeriy Mykolayovych, how can you 
predict that investments and credits will flow to a 
denuclearized Ukraine? Our economic reforms are at a standstill. 
  Shmarov: This is a difficult question. U.S. 
business circles are dissatisfied with the course of reforms in 
Ukraine. However, they consider our issue of denuclearization 
to be of key importance, and the issue of economic reforms is of 
secondary interest to them. 
  In my opinion, the United States will not force us with the 
implementation of these reforms. Though, some people think this 
way.

<F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko at the Supreme </F>
Council session in Kiev on 3 February -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Esteemed deputies, esteemed president, esteemed 
Ivan Stepanovych. You understand that the question or the whole 
problem of nuclear weapons that are located in Ukraine remains, 
for the moment, the most important problem. I would like to 
begin by saying that after the Supreme Council's ratification of 
START I, neither Russia nor the United States recognized the act 
of ratification as though it had taken place. Obviously, this 
is why we were forced to deal with an extraordinary situation 
and forced to resolve, in a short period of time, exceptionally 
complex issues. I would like to say that the situation 
developed in a very complicated way. Since the first days of 
Ukraine's independence we had never felt such intense 
international pressure, the main aim of which was to isolate us 
as quickly and as broadly as possible internationally. The main 
thing that is almost completely unacceptable and was 
unacceptable and which provoked the toughest reaction was the 
refusal by Ukraine to accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT]. On this issue I would like to assure you that 
there is an absolute consensus by CSCE member countries. The 
treaty should be universal and undoubtedly extended for an 
unspecified period. We have been given to understand that by 
refusing to accede to the NPT, Ukraine is joining a group of 
states that do not have a very high rating in the world and many 
of the world's democratic countries are talking about this. The 
second thing is that doubt was cast on the very fact that 
Ukraine would ratify the START treaty and a rumor was spread 
that Ukraine was reviewing its policy of attaining nonnuclear 
status as set out in its basic foreign policy documents. 
Obviously great harm was inflicted on Ukraine's international 
image. I will be frank. To achieve glory as an unreliable 
international partner that fails to abide by its promises -- 
moreover a country that is only two years old -- is a very 
disadvantageous and I would even say almost hopeless situation. 
To remain without support in the world community, even if one 
thinks one is right, is a losing game. You do not have to go 
far for examples. 
  I would like to note separately that President Leonid 
Makarovych Kravchuk's position on this, which he announced in a 
speech soon after the ratification of the START treaty, is 
exceptionally important. It was really an important political 
and diplomatic step. Thanks to it we managed to avoid, without 
any exaggeration, serious complications. Such a position left 
the doors open for us for contacts and for future work. How did 
our foreign policy department act under these conditions? I 
would like to tell you, esteemed people's deputies, that 
practically in the first hours following the ratification of the 
START treaty, the ministry began work on explaining the content 
of the Supreme Council's resolutions and the motives that caused 
it to raise the reservations at the time of ratification. 
[Passage omitted: Explains the mechanism by which Ukrainian 
embassies informed foreign ministries of other states and how 
Ukraine's foreign minister personally wrote to all the world's 
leading states, including the UN and NATO general secretaries, 
explaining the Ukrainian position on the ratification of START; 
Kravchuk's 30-minute telephone conversation with President 
Clinton and his telegrams to Russian President Boris Yeltsin; 
explanatory work carried out at the CSCE conference in Rome; 
Ukraine's negative image reflected in various publications] 
  You recall the phrase spoken by our president, Leonid 
Makarovych: It is the first time that I am experiencing such a 
difficult situation that Ukraine was fated to endure at the 
beginning of December 1993. We did not broadcast this widely. 
We could not do this because we understood that the nation 
might not be able to withstand all this. We dealt with this and 
worked on it calmly and took it to its conclusion. Esteemed 
deputies, international isolation -- and I would like to place 
particular emphasize on this -- creates such an attitude in the 
world toward an isolated country that any kind of forced methods 
against it are received as a naturally forced reaction to its 
behavior. As an example, I would like to remind you of the 
course of events on the eve of the war in the Persian Gulf. 
Then the United States and its allies made use of the full 
isolation of Iraq almost six months before the military 
operation, to find support for its actions throughout the entire 
world community. It was a great mistake not to take into 
account Russia's reactions on the possible transformation of 
Ukraine into a nuclear state. You are aware that such an option 
is not only unacceptable to the political and military 
leadership of that country but also plays the role of a popular 
slogan for those like one of the winners in the recent elections 
who support the transformation of Ukraine into a new Russian 
province [huberniya]. In this connection I would like to return 
to the key issues for our security and future as an independent 
state, the value of nuclear weapons as a restraining factor. 
Foreign experts and the overwhelming majority of those who 
understand these things tell us that the only weapon capable of 
halting aggression is the one that can be put to real use by 
inflicting unacceptable harm on the aggressor. Not only us, but 
all nuclear state know that Ukraine does not have operational 
control over the nuclear weapons located on our territory. 
[Passage omitted: Repeats Kravchuk's statements about not being 
able to service the weapons and that they are a threat to 
Ukraine's own security] 
  I would also like to dwell on safeguarding Ukraine's 
interests and above all the national security of our state. It 
seems that the state of our economy clearly underlines an 
obvious and undeniable truth or thesis that is only too obvious 
today: that the main component of any state's security is a 
healthy economy and socio- political stability in society. If 
this does not exist, no kind of nuclear weapon, even if it is 
controlled and reliable, will help. The example of the former 
USSR serves as an example, and Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] 
spoke about this. We must consider whether we can preserve 
independence achieved at this price if, having found ourselves 
in isolation and without friends in the world, we encounter a 
situation where supplies of energy sources and in particular of 
nuclear fuel, are completely cut off and every kind of economic 
cooperation is frozen. Could we survive for long? [Passage 
omitted: speaks about the problems of Ukraine's nuclear power 
industry, the trilateral talks in Moscow, the foreign ministry's 
utmost attempts to defend Ukraine's position at the talks; the 
need for compromise; the agreement fulfils the conditions set 
out by the Supreme Council on 18 November 1993; sums up the 
arguments in favor of Ukraine getting rid of nuclear weapons 
including the end of Ukraine's isolation] 
  We will be frank, esteemed deputies. It is a serious and 
difficult political decision but I am certain that it is the 
only one possible under the present conditions. It is about 
preserving not only Ukraine's positive image in international 
relations but about the very survival of our state. Thank you 
for your attention.

  [Text] Kiev, 8 Feb -- "Officials from Ukraine's leadership 
circles have falsified the Ukrainian Supreme Council's 
resolution of 3 February 1994 [ratifying the START I Treaty]," 
People's Deputy Serhiy Holovatyy claims. 
  During the debate on a draft resolution on the trilateral 
statement by the Ukrainian, U.S. and Russian presidents, Deputy 
Serhiy Holovatyy put forward an amendment to Paragraph 2, as 
follows: "To this end (in order to exchange ratification 
certificates), government activity should be stepped up to 
conclude specific international agreements that follow from the 
reservations in the Supreme Council's resolution on the 
ratification of the START I Treaty [the resolution now in 
question is that of 18 November 1993]." 
  This version of the resolution was approved by the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine. In the official text of the resolution, 
however, a different version of Paragraph 2 was presented. 
Namely, the words "to this end" were excluded. Thus, the 
contents of the Supreme Council's decision on this issue were 
essentially altered. The text of Paragraph 2 in its amended 
version makes provision for the following sequence of the 
Ukrainian Government's actions relating to the START I Treaty: 
first, concluding international agreements [words indistinct] 
Holovatyy, it was stated that Ukraine lifted all reservations 
relating to the START I Treaty, also including security 
guarantees. [passage indistinct] In fact, this does not conform 
with reality.

<F P=106> [Pavel Felgengauer report in the "Confrontation" column: "As </F>
of February, Ukraine Will Begin To Remove 490 Warheads to Its 
Own Bases. The Russian Army Is Preparing To Evacuate Missile 
Troop Officers"] 
  [Text] The joint Russian-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement of 14 
January on the terms for the abolition of the "Ukrainian" 
nuclear weapons, signed in Moscow by the three presidents, has 
apparently proved not more long-lasting than previous such 
accords. A week after the ink had dried on the Moscow 
declaration, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry began, without any 
coordination with Moscow, an operation of actually seizing the 
strategic nuclear weapons. 
  On 21 January Army General Lieutenant Vladimir Mikhtyuk, 
commander of the 43d Missile Army, and also the commanders of 
the 46th (Pervomayskaya) and 19th (Khmelnitskaya) missile 
divisions were summoned to Kiev to a session of the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry Collegium "on matters of military discipline 
and training." The army commander reported this to Moscow, to 
the Main Command of the Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF), because 
under an order that has been in effect for 33 years, the SRF 
army or division commander may not leave his unit without 
permission from the SRF commander in chief. In Kiev, however, 
the generals were suddenly ordered to swear the Ukrainian oath 
of allegiance. Gen. Mikhtyuk and Nikolay Filatov, commander of 
the 46th Division, under what one of the participants in the 
conference described as tough pressure, swore the Ukrainian 
oath. Rustam Karimov, commander of the 19th division, refused. 
  After that the 43d Missile Army was actually placed outside 
the SRF Main Command's operational control. General Karimov has 
been removed from the post of division commander and is to fly 
to Moscow within the next few days. Today or tomorrow a new, 
"Ukrainian" commander will arrive at the 19th Missile Division 
who will be appointed by the Ukrainian defense minister without 
any coordination with Moscow. The SRF Command stated that they 
do not even know the new commander's name. Prior to that, 
during the last two years, all cadre reshuffles in the missile 
troops in Ukraine were made only by a joint order after they 
were coordinated in Moscow and Kiev. 
  On 22 January the Ukrainian defense minister signed Order 
001 
(classified as top secret) whereby the troops of the 43d Army 
must be prepared as of 1 February to begin removing the nuclear 
ammunition from the depots of the 19th and 46th divisions (all 
in all, 490 units) to "S" installations, from where Russian 
specialists were withdrawn last year and where the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry has deployed its own nuclear units, manned 
partly by officers of the 12th Main Directorate of the Russian 
Defense Ministry who stayed in Ukraine and partly by reserve 
officers. Colonel General Igor Smirnov, SRF commander in chief, 
sent a coded telegram to the Ukrainian defense minister 
expressing in a polite form his professional concern over the 
situation, but has not received any answer yet. 
  The SRF Main Command is currently making preparations for an 
urgent evacuation to Russia of all missile officers who refuse 
to swear the Ukrainian oath. According to SRF Main Command 
estimates, between 40 and 50 percent of the officers will leave. 
The divisions will become combat-incapable, the combat duty 
system will be disrupted, and political confrontation in missile 
unit crews between "pro-Ukrainian" and "pro-Russian" officers is 
possible. 
  Up until now Russia has been rendering the 43d Army 
technical 
assistance in maintaining its entire extremely complex strategic 
missile systems while officers have been undergoing regular 
retraining within the SRF framework. Now supplies and technical 
assistance for the army have been stopped. The Russian military 
is no longer in control of the situation. It believes that it 
has done everything possible within its jurisdiction and that 
now the problem of the Ukrainian nuclear weapons will again have 
to be decided by politicians in Moscow, Kiev, and Washington.

<F P=106> [Military observer Vladimir Klimov "Topical Commentary:" </F>
"Where Are Missiles Targeted?"] 
  [Excerpts] Hamlet's question "To be or not to be?" remains 
the main question of the day. I was surely not the only one to 
think so on learning that the Russian and U.S. presidents had 
announced the detargeting of strategic missiles in the Moscow 
declaration. 
  "For the first time since the beginning of the nuclear era 
our countries have stopped targeting missiles at each other," 
Major General Anatoliy Svetikov, deputy chief of the Strategic 
Rocket Forces Staff Directorate, believes. [passage omitted] 
  Yet the past is still with us. The following questions have 
arisen from there, from the alarming past: Is the retargeting 
of missiles and their return to their former condition possible 
and how long would this take? Let us allow the specialist, Maj. 
Gen. Svetikov, to speak: 
  "The process of introducing and scrapping missions operates 
on many levels and planes. It varies for different categories 
and types of missile. The scrapping of missions will depend on 
the principle chosen by the two countries' presidents. As 
regards resumption, I can say that as long as a missile is on 
alert status there is always a possibility of returning 
everything to its former place. How long will this take? Long 
enough, although the times vary for different categories and 
types of missile. I do not intend to talk about time periods 
but have singled out the most important thing: the 
implementation of the presidents' decision sharply reduces the 
threshold of a nuclear strike." 
  How nice it would be to put a period after such an 
optimistic 
conclusion and to exclaim joyfully "The End!" Alas, there is 
still a long way to go before the end; dreams about a complete 
ban on nuclear weapons still remain dreams. The nuclear danger 
comes not from across the ocean but from Russia's doorstep -- 
Ukraine. Its president pledged to transport nuclear warheads to 
us for dismantling. But some of them are already in a critical 
condition. 
  Yet again we have to talk of the unreasonableness of certain 
vociferous politicians. Specialists, foreseeing the 
complexities with missiles, made an agreement about centralized 
maintenance of them. But some Ukrainian deputies saw Moscow's 
evil hand in this too. The agreements, which did not need 
parliament's ratification, were blocked by it. We, they said, 
will overcome. 
  But how can routine inspection and maintenance work and the 
maintenance of missile complexes be undertaken when there are 
not enough resources or specialists? The result of the 
deputies' veto is the alarming technical condition of missiles 
in Ukraine. Following inspection, warheads were removed from 
some missile launchers which had simply become dangerous. 
  Hamlet's question has now crystallized over these missile 
silos. How will people answer it?

<F P=106> [TRUD military observer Viktor Badurkin commentary under the </F>
"View on Situation" rubric: "Should We Have No Faith in Signed 
Document?"] 
  [Text] The signatures of Presidents Boris Yeltsin, Leonid 
Kravchuk, and Bill Clinton had hardly dried out on their joint 
Statement on the future fate of Ukrainian nuclear missiles when 
it began to be "torpedoed" in Kiev in parliament and especially 
at the Ministry of Defense. Whereas the parliamentarians 
restricted themselves to verbal criticism of their president's 
conciliatory behavior and their dissatisfaction with the amount 
of compensation for nuclear disarmament, the generals 
immediately embarked on decisive action. 
  At first the idea developed at the heart of the military 
department of retaining on a temporary basis at "S" facilities 
(special bases) the nuclear warheads which had been separated 
from their delivery vehicles. And then a week ago an 
unexpectedly but very insistent proposal was made at the 
ministry collegium that the command of missile troops stationed 
on Ukrainian territory should take an oath of allegiance to 
Ukraine. 
  On the subject of the political "overtones" of the moves by 
the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, it is hard to see them as 
anything but a clear challenge to the line which Leonid Kravchuk 
is pursuing with regard to the state's nuclear disarmament. 
After all it is clearly written into the Moscow agreement that 
all nuclear warheads should be withdrawn from Ukrainian 
territory to Russia for the purpose of their subsequent 
dismantling in the shortest possible time. You might ask, why 
then compel the missile troops' officers to take an oath of 
allegiance to Ukraine, why form their own missile troops, and 
why create a command center for strategic nuclear forces? 
  You can only come to one conclusion: The Kiev generals are, 
irrespective of the consequences, attempting to draw out the 
process of handing over the nuclear weapons to Russia. What is 
more, this is being done to the accompaniment of public 
assurances from the minister Vitaliy Radetskyy about the 
soundness of the three presidents' decision. 
  I think that the key to this paradox is fairly simple. In 
order to command strategic forces you have at least to have 
some, otherwise the number of posts is cut, which means a loss 
of power, privileges, and everything else which guarantees the 
rank of general. Therefore, the Ukrainian military's reaction 
is completely understandable. It is more difficult to explain 
the parliamentarians' behavior. Colonel General Yevgeniy 
Maslin, chief specialist in nuclear missiles at the Russian 
Ministry of Defense, told me about his recent appearance before 
Kiev deputies. For about an hour he explained to them how 
dangerous it is not only for Ukraine but for the whole Europe to 
continue to store nuclear weapons without proper maintenance and 
replacement of their components, after which questions were put 
to him in rapid succession, including for example: But how much 
will Russia be able to afford for the Ukrainian warheads? An 
example of how politics and trade are interconnected.... 
  Meanwhile, for some reason nobody is taking any interest in 
how much it will cost Russia to dismantle the "independent" 
[Ukrainian] munitions. Very likely much more than the $60 
million the United States has appropriated for this purpose. 
(Incidentally, even this money is not "compensation" from kindly 
Uncle Sam for hazardous work undertaken, nor is it disinterested 
aid, but merely an advance made against the Russian share in the 
contract for highly enriched uranium.) At the same time Russia 
has also agreed to provide Ukraine with fuel assemblies for 
nuclear power stations containing 100 tonnes of low-enriched 
uranium as the a first installment of the settlement for 200 
missile warheads which in the next 10 months should be 
transferred to our plants for dismantling. 
  If the Kiev politicians and generals do nevertheless manage 
to draw out this process, we may all regret the consequences. 
The price of procrastination is too high -- radiation respects 
no borders. Three SS-24 missile warheads which were recently 
urgently transported to Russia in a dangerous [predavariynyy] 
condition proved this. Due to periodic technical maintenance 
not being carried out at the proper time, hydrogen and other 
constituents began to accumulate in them resulting in a buildup 
of explosive gas. Apart from this, as time goes by nuclear 
munitions are subject to corrosion, the products of which are 
toxic and radioactive. There are after all 46 SS-24 missile 
launchers, 130 SS-19 launchers, and about 40 TU-160 and TU-95 
heavy bombers of the Navy, for which almost 670 long-range 
cruise missiles with nuclear warheads are in storage. 
  Missile complexes began to be wound down in November and the 
Ukrainian storage facilities are at this moment already 
overflowing with nose sections and nuclear weapons taken off 
alert status, which has significantly increased the background 
radiation. This is no empty claim but a fact confirmed by the 
chief designers from Arzamas-16 who have visited Pervomaysk. It 
is at the very least shortsighted and foolhardy not to take what 
they say into consideration. 
  There is one more side to the question. Next year the Treaty 
on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons runs out. If Ukraine 
does not become a party to it as a nonnuclear power, a dangerous 
precedent will be set for the whole world. In such 
circumstances the notorious "domino" effect cannot be ruled out 
as there are more than enough people wishing to follow this bad 
example, including those along Russia's southern borders. 
  We can only rely on the good sense of Kiev's politicians and 
the Ukrainian president's ability to carry out the adopted 
decisions and to keep to the obligations he signed with his own 
hand.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Kostenko, Ukraine's people's deputy, head </F>
of the deputies working group for nuclear disarmament issues, 
and minister of environmental protection: "`General Atomics' Is 
Precisely What Ukraine Urgently Needs"] 
  [Text] 
<H3>  At the Request of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA, a True Specialist Shows 
How To Make Proper Calculations With Pencil in Hand </H3>
  1. Among the possible variants for utilizing the 
highly-enriched uranium removed from nuclear warheads, the 
proposal by the American "General Atomics" company was the most 
acceptable. The contract provided for creating in Ukraine a 
joint enterprise to process highly-enriched uranium and 
transform it into nuclear fuel for atomic electric power plants 
[AES's]. 
  The following are the advantages of this variant: 
  m--no expenditure associated with the transportation of 
highly enriched uranium; 
  m--with the help of contemporary ecologically safe 
technologies, highly enriched uranium may be effectively 
transformed into fuel; 
  m--conditions are created for Ukraine to earn hard currency 
rapidly; 
  m--Ukraine's long-term technological cooperation with the 
world's advanced companies in the sphere of nuclear power 
engineering. 
  An enterprise, more specifically a small production unit, 
may 
be built within one or two years. The cost of the construction 
is $30 million. After the fulfillment of the program for 
processing the highly-enriched uranium, the production may be 
reprofiled for the needs of Ukraine's nuclear-fuel cycle. 
  2. The transfer of nuclear warheads to Russia is stipulated 
by interstate documents "The Main Principles of the Utilization 
of Nuclear Charges of the Strategic Nuclear Forces Deployed in 
Ukraine" and "The Agreement Between the Ukrainian Government and 
the Government of the Russian Federation on the Utilization of 
Nuclear Warheads," which were signed on 3 September 1993 in 
Massandra [in the Crimea] during the meetings of presidents L.M. 
Kravchuk and B.N. Yeltsin. In accordance with the clauses of 
the aforementioned agreements, Ukraine committed itself to 
transferring to Russia all types of nuclear warheads of 
intercontinental nuclear missiles and air-launched cruise 
missiles for them to be dismantled and utilized. 
  No other possible variants of dismantling nuclear warheads 
were considered. 
  3. On the world market, the price of nuclear fuel, which is 
supplied in accordance with long-term contracts, amounts to 
between $1,000 and $1,400 per kilogram. One-time agreements on 
fuel supply are somewhat cheaper -- between $600 and $700 per 
kilogram. 
  Ukraine receives all its fuel for atomic plants from Russian 
enterprises at prices close to world prices. However, practice 
shows that the majority of world countries with nuclear power 
engineering have their own enterprises that manufacture fuel 
cartridges because it is economically rational. Ukraine has 
large deposits of uranium ore and some functioning enterprises 
of the nuclear-fuel cycle -- the enrichment of crude uranium, 
production of zirconium for heat-generating elements, absorbing 
materials, and so on. That is why it would be much more 
profitable for Ukraine to manufacture our own fuel cartridges 
than to purchase them from Russia. The cost of constructing 
such an enterprise is about $500 million; it could be built 
within two or three years; in the conditions prevailing in 
Ukraine, the period of recoupment would be three years. 
  4. If we proceed from the assumption that capacities for 
the production of nuclear fuel are created in Ukraine, something 
upon which Ukrainian nuclear specialists and scientists insist, 
then it is most expedient to use nuclear materials from the 
warheads for the needs of our own power engineering. 
  If nuclear warheads are transferred to Russia, it is much 
more profitable for Ukraine to receive compensation for the 
nuclear materials, and not compensation in the form of nuclear 
fuel. For example, in accordance with some estimates, the cost 
of highly- enriched uranium is 100 times that of the price of 
low-grade uranium contained in the fuel cartridge, and 
weapons-grade plutonium costs between five and 10 times that of 
the highly-enriched uranium. That is why Ukraine is entitled to 
compensation of $10 billion for the nuclear materials from 
tactical weapons alone. The cost of all those fuel cartridges, 
which Russia promises to supply in exchange for Ukraine's 
nuclear weapons will only constitute between $1 billion and $2 
billion. 
  5. The problem here lies not so much in the inability of 
scientific collectives as in the absence of desire on the part 
of our leadership to do something. 
  6. In accordance with Ukraine's Supreme Council decree "On 
Additional Measures for Ensuring Ukraine's Nonnuclear Status," 
which was adopted in April 1992, the government had to take 
urgent measures to establish effective technological control 
over the nonuse of the nuclear weapons located on the territory 
of Ukraine. It was planned to have this work fulfilled by one of 
the Kharkiv Institutes which developed practically all systems 
of control over the former USSR's strategic offensive weapons. 
  The Supreme Council's decisions have not been fulfilled to 
this day and, for that reason, it is, probably, appropriate to 
speak about seven to 10 years, in order not to do anything at 
all. 
  Partnership for Peace is the attempt, on the part of the 
United States, without entering into a conflict with Russia, to 
fill in that vacuum of security that resulted from the 
disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the USSR. However, in 
conditions of political instability and expansion of the 
revanchist moods in Russia, the West's indecisiveness in 
creating effective security systems in Europe may lead to yet 
another redivision of the spheres of influence and to a 
restoration of Russian hegemony within the CIS or Eastern Europe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vasyl Kotko, deputy chairman of Ukraine's </F>
State Committee for the Utilization of Nuclear Energy, by 
UKRINFORM correspondent Viktor Rozsokha; place and date not 
given: "How Much Is an Atomic Kilowatt?" -- first three 
paragraphs published in boldface] 
  [Text] It is hardly necessary to explain what energy 
sources mean for Ukraine and for its economy today. Nor is it 
necessary to explain that our standard of living increasingly 
depends upon the cost of electric energy, coal, gas, and fuel 
oil. 
  The conference of heads of Ukraine's basic industries -- 
power engineering, metallurgy, and coal industry -- that was 
recently held at the Cabinet of Ministers showed that there will 
be no easy decisions. Although there was consensus on the need 
to reasonably restrain prices of products, the very approaches 
to the forming of the tariffs were not responded to unanimously. 
  This is how deputy chairman of Ukraine's State Committee for 
the Utilization of Nuclear Energy Vasyl Kotko explains the 
position of atomic power engineers. 
  Kotko: Atomic power engineering is perhaps the 
only branch of Ukraine's national economy that finished the year 
1993 with a marked growth in the volume of production. 
  However, the situation that has presently taken shape in the 
industry, is not simply difficult, but, one can say, 
catastrophic. All of the AES's [atomic electric power plants] 
are in an extremely difficult economic situation. Due to lack 
of funds, starting from the second part of 1993, virtually no 
fuel has been purchased. In 1993, the amount of fuel purchased 
was half that in 1990. Also, due to lack of funds, used nuclear 
fuel has not been taken out for long-term storage. Contractual 
relations with regard to equipment, spare parts, and scientific 
servicing of nuclear installations between the AES's and many 
suppliers have practically been severed.... 
  Rozsokha: However, our atomic power engineering 
is fully cost accountable and depends upon the electric energy 
it produces. How could it happen that a branch with such growth 
in production volume has now almost become a financial bankrupt? 
  Kotko: The explanation here is in that the atomic 
power engineers have produced the electric energy and sold it to 
the state, but the state has not paid for it. There are two 
reasons here. An apparent reason lies in the fact that our main 
and only consumer -- the National Dispatcher Center at Ukraine's 
Ministry of Power Engineering -- does not pay at all or does not 
pay regularly for the electric energy received from us. The 
ministry's debt to the atomic plants is presently about 550 
billion karbovantsi [K], or approximately the cost of our 
month's operation. However, this is how the matter appears. 
The main cause lies in our government's policy with regard to 
tariffs. By fixing the prices of electric energy, coal, and 
gas, it is trying to curb the total growth of prices in all 
branches of the national economy, more specifically, to curb 
inflation. I will point out that, from the beginning of 1993, 
the tariff for the AES's remained unchanged for almost half a 
year. The putting into effect of every new tariff was delayed 
by one or two months. As a result, inflation was not stopped, 
but power engineering resources were strongly depleted. It is 
even difficult to estimate the losses. 
  Rozsokha: What is today's rate of the electric 
energy produced by atomic plants? 
  Kotko: It is presently K118 per kilowatt/hour. 
However, on the whole, throughout last year, our rate was at 
least one-half that at thermal plants. AES's represent 
effective power engineering. 
  Rozsokha: Why then, in such an economic 
situation, can you not convince the government of the need to 
change the policy regarding tariffs? 
  Kotko: The government has officially recognized 
the need to change the tariffs policy. Moreover, it pointed out 
in its resolution that the prices of electric energy must change 
automatically only in those cases when the prices of energy 
sources increase by more than 20 percent. 
  Rozsokha: However, the Cabinet of Ministers does 
not fulfill its own decision. Why? 
  Kotko: Because it realizes that an increase in 
the prices of energy sources will lead to an increase of prices 
of everything else. That is why it is trying to maintain the 
previously set prices as long as possible. 
  It goes without saying that nobody -- either the population 
or the government -- wants to have the prices of bread, butter, 
and that same electric energy raised. However, this unpopular 
decision will later have to be adopted, but with more serious 
consequences. 
  Rozsokha: How much longer can the AES's persevere 
if this policy with regard to tariffs continues? 
  Kotko: I believe that we have now reached the 
limit and have exhausted the resources of the branch and, if 
such a policy continues, irreversible processes may start. 
  I think that if the situation does not change now, we will, 
tomorrow, find ourselves in a situation in which stoppages of 
some power units and possibly also of all atomic plants 
successively, will be inevitable. We now need to urgently 
revise our tariff, which must be at least K300 per 
kilowatt/hour. It must change with the rate of inflation. 
These are two minimum mandatory conditions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Defense -- Triple Contract With </F>
Saudi Arabia"] 
  [Excerpts] France and Saudi Arabia have entered into three 
armament contracts involving the upgrading of warships and the 
maintenance of ground-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft 
batteries, the Defense Ministry announced yesterday. [passage 
omitted covered in ref] 
  The three contracts are as follows: 
  -- The ROH contract, worth Fr3.5 billion, provides for the 
upgrading of four 2,000-tonne frigates and two 10,000-tonne 
refueling tankers sold in 1980 (Sawari I contract). The 
upgrading, to be carried out in Toulon (Var region) by the 
French Naval Construction Division (DCN), entails over 3 million 
hours of work for DCN and 1.2 million hours for subcontractors 
and services suppliers (Thomson-CSF, Navfco). To this must be 
added the support services for the six ships' crews, which will 
remain on board during the whole upgrading process. To take 
full advantage of this period of inactivity, some equipment and 
on-board weapon systems will also be upgraded. 
  -- The SLBS (Logistical Support for Bitube and Shahine 
Systems) maintenance contract, worth Fr3.4 billion, is the 
continuation of the 'Al-Thaked contract (1984), which provided 
for the provision of short-range ground-to-air Crotale-Shahine 
missiles batteries and bitube 30-millimeter weapon systems 
(complete with command stations, carriages, and radars). French 
manufacturers will supply spare parts and technical assistance. 
  -- The Shola maintenance contract, worth about Fr2 billion, 
involves rocket thruster units for short-range ground-to-air 
Shahine and Crotale missiles previously purchased by Saudi 
Arabia. The program provides for replacing several hundred 
thruster units intended for all missiles already sold, and 
includes technical assistance. Both missile-related contracts 
entail some 4.5 million hours of work, which will be distributed 
between project leader Thomson-CSF and its major subcontractors 
(Giat industrie, Renault Vehicules Industriels, Matra, SNPE 
[National Company for Powders and Explosives]).

  [Text] Seoul and Washington agreed to deploy Patriot 
missile batteries at U.S. army bases in South Korea in March or 
April, a senior government official said yesterday. 
  He said the U.S. move for early deployment of Patriot 
missiles in South Korea is, in part, aimed at putting pressure 
on North Korea to come to an agreement with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  If the North Korean nuclear problem is solved at an early 
date, the anti-missile missiles could be deployed in Japan 
instead, the official said. 
  He said U.S. President Clinton has not given final approval 
for the deployment of Patriot missiles, but is expected to 
approve it sooner or later. 
  "The South Korean government agrees to the deployment in 
principle and the interceptor missiles will be deployed at the 
bases of U.S. forces here in March or April at the latest," the 
official said. 
  He said the 36 Patriot missiles to be deployed here are for 
protection of strategic points of U.S. forces in South Korea 
rather than for defense of densely populated areas including 
Seoul and the surrounding metropolitan area. 
  Deployment of Patriots on the Korean Peninsula is the first 
step in establishing the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, 
which the U.S. government is pushing for on a long-term basis. 
  Washington confirmed Wednesday it was considering deployment 
of Patriot missiles in South Korea to defend its ally against 
North Korean attack. 
  Gen. Gary Luck, commander of U.S. forces in Korea, requested 
deployment of Patriot missiles late last year to prepare against 
Scud missile attacks by North Korea.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 28 
January carry articles and editorials on the pending U.S.-ROK 
plan to deploy Patriot missiles and other new weapons to the 
peninsula. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 1 a 400-word report 
from Washingon in connection with a U.S. plan to replace the 
existing Cobra helicopters deployed in South Korea with new 
Apache helicopters and to send an aircraft carrier to South 
Korea in addition to deploying Patriot missiles. 
  The report, quoting THE WASHINGTON POST dated 27 January, 
notes the Clinton Administration's plan to replace the existing 
Cobra Helicopter unit deployed in South Korea with two new-type 
Apache helicopter battalions. 
  The report also quotes THE WASHINGTON POST as reporting that 
"the Clinton Administration is ready to approve the plan to 
deploy Patriot missiles to South Korea requested by General Gary 
E. Luck, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, but it is now waiting 
for the ROK Government's final approval." The report continues 
to quote the U.S. paper as reporting that the ROK Government 
worries that the deployment of Patriot missiles "would irritate 
North Korea." 
  The report also quotes THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting 
that 
"the U.S. Defense Department is considering deploying an 
aircraft carrier on the waters near the Korean peninsula." The 
report quotes THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that General 
Gary E. Luck requested one Patriot missile battalion which 
consists of "64 launching platforms, 256 Patriot missiles, and 
special radar devices which are capable of tracing several 
targts simultaneously." 
  HANGUK ILBO also carries on page 5 a 500-word article by 
Wsshington-based correspondent Chong Il-hwa on performance data 
of the Patriot missile and a 500-word article by reporter Yi 
Sang-won on that of North Korea's Nodong-1 long-range missile. 
  Noting in detail the formidable performance of the Patriot 
missile as demonstrated during the Gulf war, the article by 
correspondent Chong Il-hwa describes the process of the 
upgrading of the Patriot system. 
  The article by reporter Yi Sang-won notes that North Korea's 
Nodong-1 missile was reportedly developed from the former Soviet 
Union's surface-to-surface Scud missile developed in the 1980's 
and that it is reportedly now deployed for use in an actual war. 
The article notes the performance of the Nodong-1 missile, 
including its size and range, adding that North Korea is 
reported "to possess 12 to 18 Nodong-1 missiles at present." The 
article also cites that the Nodong-2 missile is now in the 
developmental stage. 
  HANGUK ILBO carries on page 7 an 800-word article by 
Washington- based correspondent Chong Chin-sok on the reasons 
for the pending U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK. 
Noting the recent "hardline" moves by the U.S. Government in 
connection with the North Korean nuclear issue such as the 
pending U.S. plan to deploy the Patriot missile to the ROK, the 
CIA director's secret visit to Seoul, and U.S. Government 
officials' strong-worded remarks on the North Korean nuclear 
issue, the article says: "People hold that these moves are 
probably either a sort of nuclear negotiation card to apply 
pressure on North Korea or a political card for U.S. domestic 
purposes." The article says, however, the fact that the 
hardline moves against North Korea have been led by the 
Department of Defense and the CIA suggests that they are aimed 
at warning North Korea. 
  The article notes different approaches between the U.S. 
Department of Defense and the CIA and the Department of State in 
dealing with North Korea regarding the nuclear issue. The 
article concludes that the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles 
to South Korea can be interpreted as a result of the hawkish 
line led by the Department of Defense and the CIA. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 a 600-word 
editorial on the pending plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the 
ROK under the title "New Arrangement of the Situation on the 
Korean Peninsula." Saying that the plan to deploy the Patriot 
missile can be considered prior preparations taken in 
consideration of the start of the UN sanctions against North 
Korea, the article notes North Korea's protracted delaying 
tactics in the negotiations with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency and the United States. The article also notes the recent 
reports by Russian nuclear experts about the possibility of 
North Korea possessing one to two nuclear bombs, the CIA 
director's secret visit to Seoul, and the deployment of a "U.S. 
national intelligence support team" in the ROK, and says that 
these moves show that "a new move for arranging the situation on 
the Korean peninsula in connection with the North Korean nuclear 
issue is in progress." 
  The editorial continues: "In particular, the deployment of 
Patriot missiles to South Korea will bring a big change to the 
military situation of the Korean peninsula, regardless of 
whether it is intended to cope with the North Korean troops 
concentrated along the DMZ, whether it is a prior step in taking 
sanctions against North Korea, or whether it is 'a sophisticated 
tactic to sell' Patriot missles to the ROK." The article 
concludes by stressing the need for our government to properly 
deal with the changing situation of the Korean peninsula. 
  TONG-A ILBO also carries on page 4 a 1,000-word article by 
reporter Kim Chae-hong. The article notes that "the U.S. plan to 
deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK can be considered to be an 
expression of the strong will of the United States to cope with 
possible North Korean provocation, but the ROK worries that the 
presence of Patriot missiles on the Korean peninsula would 
irritate North Korea and have a serious effect on the nuclear 
negotiations with North Korea." 
  The article is followed by a long explanation of the 
technological aspect of the Patriot missile, including its 
performance demonstrated during the Gulf war. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 a 900-word 
editorial entitled "The Merit of Patriot Deployment." The 
editorial notes North Korea's persistent refusal to comply with 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] demands for the 
inspection of its nuclear sites, increasing the likelihood of UN 
military and economic sanctions on North Korea, and says, "The 
U.S. plan to transfer to and deploy the anti-missile Patriot 
missiles to the ROK shows that the U.S. warning to North Korea 
in connection with the nuclear issue is becoming a reality. The 
ROK Government is inclined to accept the U.S. plan." The 
editorial then notes the deployment of Patriot missiles to the 
ROK has been considered for some time to augment the defense 
capability of the U.S. ground forces in the ROK to effectively 
counter the North's surprise attack, irrespective of the nuclear 
issue, in view of the difficulty of U.S. reinforcement forces in 
arriving in the ROK swiftly enough in case of a North Korean 
surprise attack. The editorial then notes the doubts about the 
performance of the Patriot missile which was used during the 
Gulf war, citing the U.S. accounting audit personnel's 
revelation that the Patriot's capability of destroying the 
enemy's missile warheads was only nine percent. The editorial 
goes on to note the insufficient performance of the Patriot, 
namely, its fragments falling out up to one kilometer diameter, 
increasing danger for civilian casualties, and shrinking 
performance in mountainous areas like the Korean peninsula. The 
editorial concludes by noting, "It is, therefore, effective for 
combat purposes to deploy the much-improved second stage Patriot 
missiles. The deployment of the type which was used during the 
Gulf war could give an impression that the United States is 
disposing of old stock. The deployment of the Patriot should 
not be viewed only from the perspective of creating tension 
between the North and the South." 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 4 carries a 900-word article by 
New 
York-based correspondent Pak Su-man and reporter Song Yong-sung 
entitled "What Was the Background for the Deployment of the 
Patriot in the ROK?--Pros And Cons in the ROK and the United 
States." The article notes, "The U.S. Government plan to deploy 
Patriot missiles to the ROK implies that the United States is 
preparing for the potential circumstances where not only 
economic but also military sanctions will have to be taken in 
case of a failure to bring about the settlement of the North 
Korean nuclear issue." The article notes the view of U.S. 
intelligence agencies that the Patriot will be capable of 
protecting the targets of a preemptive North Korean missile 
attack on the ROK. The article notes some ROK Government 
officials show an unwelcome reaction to the U.S. plan but 
refrain from explicitly commenting on it under the weight of the 
cause of building up the combat capability of the ROK-U.S. 
combined forces. The article also notes, "Some are of the 
opinion that if the nuclear inspection negotiation fails and the 
situation aggravates leading to sanctions on the North, North 
Korea may well be angered by it, and that it will then be 
necessary for the U.S. Forces in the ROK to be equipped with an 
augmented combat capability to cope with such a situation." The 
article then notes insufficient performance of the Patriot and 
some ROK Government officials' view that the deployment of the 
Patriot is ill-timed for the North Korea-U.S. negotiation on the 
nuclear issue. 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 4 also carries an 800-word article 
by reporter Choe Chung-ung on the performance of the Patriot 
missile which notes that the Patriot intercepted and shot down 
50 to 60 percent of the Scud missiles during the Gulf war and 
the "shortcomings" of the Patriot, namely, "its enormous price, 
namely $120 million per unit; the extensive fallout of its 
fragments which can cause heavy human casualties and material 
loss; and the helpless situation in case the enemy fires the 
missile with a chemical warhead." 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 4 also carries a 200-word article 
by ?eporter Pak Hun-sin in the column "Reporter's Bench." The 
article notes the opposition Democratic Party's [DP] position 
concerning the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK, 
and refers to remarks by DPR CHairman Yi Ki-taek: "The 
deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK at this critical 
juncture when negotiations for nuclear inspection is underway 
can adversely affect the inter-Korean dialogue although it is 
said to be for defensive purposes." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN on pag? 4 carries a 
1,000-word article by Washington-based correspondent Yi 
Kyong-hyong entitled "The Meaning of the U.S. Plan To Deploy 
Patriot Missiles--To Provide a Shield for the ROK Defenseless to 
Scud Gttack." The article says, "The U.S. plan to deploy 
Patriot missiles to the ROK seems to be prompted by the sheer 
defensive purposes in preparation for a North Korean Scud 
missile attack." The article stresses that the Patriot 
deployment is far from designed to pose a new threat to North 
Korea, and notes, "Nevertheless, the prevailing view about the 
plan to deploy =atriot missiles is that it will serve as 
important leverage to pressure North Korea into an early 
acceptance of nuclear inspection." The article goes on to note, 
"The deployment of the Patriot missiles in he ROK seems to be 
the U.S. measure to demonstrate its resolute will to defend the 
ROK." 
  SEOUL SINMUN on page 7 carries an 800-word report compiled 
from AP, YONHAP reports from Washington entitled "Patriot's 
Interception Capability 'Unsatisfactory.'" The report says, 
"The Patriot intercept missile, which the United States is 
planning to deploy to the ROK, is a little improved from the 
type used in the Gulf war but is reported to have only a limited 
capability against the North Korean missile attack. The PAC 
II-type Patriot, which is expected to be deployed in the ROK, 
was used by Saudi Arabia and Israel in 1991, and there is 
controversy over its capability to hit the target. Political 
analyst (Baker Spring) of the Heritage Foundation said that the 
United States is now developing the PAC III, and the missile to 
be deployed in the ROK will be the PAC II." The article 
concludes by quoting a#remark by a U.S. military strategist that 
the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK is made more 
from political considerations than from military considerations. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 1 a 650-word 
article by Washington-based correspondent Chong Hae-yong citing 
the 27 January WASHINGTON TIMES' article which said that "To 
cope with the possibility of North Korea's missile attack, the 
Clinton Administration plans to deploy 256 Patriot missiles (64 
launching pads) and special radar equipment capable of chasing 
and intercepting several targets at the same time to the ROK." 
The article also quotes the WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that 
"the plan to deploy the Patriot missiles in the ROK is an 
important sign that the United States is concerned about the 
failure of negotiations over nuclear inspections of North 
Korea's facilities." The article also quotes the WASHINGTON 
POST report on the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles in major 
ports and airports of the ROK and on U.S. plans to sell the 
Patriot missiles to the ROK. The article concludes by citing 
WASHINGTON POST as saying that "the U.S. Government is promoting 
the plan to station two Apache helicopter battalions in the ROK 
which will replace the existing Cobra helicopter battalion." 
  The CHOSON ILBO also carries an 800-word article by reporter 
Pak Tu-sik on page 5 about the ROK Government's reaction to the 
deployment of the Patriot missiles in Korea, and notes that all 
along, the ROK and U.S. Governments have stressed "deployment of 
the Patriot missiles only in consideration of security and 
technology." The article says that "such an explanation by both 
the ROK and U.S. Governments is aimed at preventing the 
introduction of Patriot missiles from having a bad effect on 
negotiations on North Korea's nuclear issue." Then the article 
points out the possibility that "the deployment of the Patriot 
missiles may give North Korea, which has currently been driven 
to a corner, a pretext for frustrating negotiations with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]." The article notes 
the unfavorable reaction of our government's working-level 
officials involved in negotiations with North Korea. The article 
then notes prevailing opinion that "beginning with the 
deployment of the Patriot missiles, the United States-led 
regional missile defense system--'TMD-Theater Missile 
Defense'--should be more systematically reviewed," and also 
notes that "under the present circumstances with North Korea's 
missile threat, the introduction of weapons should be reviewed 
in terms of a middle and long-term plan, rather than a 
short-term plan." 
  CHOSON ILBO also carries on page 5 an 800-word article by 
Kyong Yong-won analyzing the efficiency of the deployment of 
Patriot missiles to the ROK, in which he notes the Patriot 
missiles' defects the low accuracy rate of 50-60 percent and the 
nine-percent destruction rate. Then the article says that "even 
if the Patriot missile's defects are remedied, it is doubtful 
whether the Patriot missiles will be efficient considering the 
many stumbling blocks, including high mountains, that exist on 
Korean terrain." Comparing Korean terrain with the Gulf war 
example, the article points out that although it took 20-30 
minutes for a Scud missile launched in Iraq to reach a target, 
"the early-warning time is no less than three or five minutes" 
on the Korean peninsula because the battlefield depth is only 40 
km. The article says that assuming that the Patriot missiles 
take three to five minutes to chase and intercept a target, "the 
Patriot missiles have almost no time to intercept a Scud missile 
once it is launched in North Korea." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 4 a 
1,400-word article by Washington-based correspondent Chong 
Yon-chu which cites NEW YORK TIMES and AP News Agency reports on 
U.S. plans to deploy the Patriot missile system to the ROK. 
Quoting U.S. officials as saying that "because the Patriot 
missiles are purely defensive, their deployment in the ROK will 
not aggravate tension on the Korean peninsula," the article says 
that "even though the Patriot missiles are defensive, their 
deployment is sure to strengthen the military power of the ROK 
Army and the U.S. Forces in Korea. It is difficult to predict 
what reaction North Korea will show and what effect the 
deployment of the Patriot missiles will have on negotiations 
over the nuclear issue." After noting that some U.S. State 
Department officials were concerned over the bad effect the 
Patriot missiles might have on nuclear negotiations with North 
Korea, the article says that "considering the situation of the 
Korean peninsula, the weapons for `defense' may be turned into 
weapons of 'political offensive' which cause crises and 
tension." The article concludes: "Generally speaking, the 
deployment of Patriot missiles will have a bad effect on the 
solution of North Korea's nuclear issue and on reconciliation 
trends on the Korean peninsula. In this connection, some 
analysts point out that North Korea should also be to blame for 
dallying too long in the political game of negotiations with the 
United States and the IAEA. If there had been more rapid 
progress in nuclear negotiations and a foundation for resolving 
the nuclear issue had been laid, the military hard liners within 
the U.S. Administration would not have had an excuse for a 
hard-line policy." 
  The HANGYORE SINMUN also carries on page 4 a 600-word 
article 
by Yi Sang-ki detailing the capabilities of the Patriot missiles 
which he says are commonly known as the "missile that catches 
missiles." After noting that hundreds of Patriot missiles have 
been deployed in the U.S. continent, Germany, Netherlands, 
Italy, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, the article says "the supreme 
speed of the Patriot Missiles is Mach 6 and their firing range 
is known to be over 150 km. Their effective range is 70 km and 
it takes the Patriot missiles three minutes to launch and 
intercept the enemy's target." The article notes that Patriot 
missiles were on display at the U.S. Suwon Base during the Ulchi 
Focus exercise in 1992 and during the Team Spirit exercise last 
year, and points out that: "There are some that say that the 
Patriot missiles are not suitable for Korean terrain because, 
for starters, the Patriot missiles are too expensive with the 
price of each launching pad amounting to $150 million; second, 
considering that Korean terrain has short battlefield depth, the 
efficiency of Patriot missiles is doubted." The article says: 
"Unlike the depth of the battlefield in the Gulf War, Seoul is 
less than 40 km away from the Armistice Line, so the accuracy of 
the missile's air interception rate will not reach that of the 
Gulf War. In addition, contrary to U.S. press reports of the 
Patriot missile's 80-90 percent target-hitting rate, its 
target-hitting rate is in fact only about 50-60 percent." The 
article concludes by quoting general opinion within the army 
that "considering economic and accuracy conditions, the Patriot 
missiles will provide nothing more than mental stability when 
facing a southward attack." 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 2 a 
500-word article by Washington-based reporter Chin Chang-ho 
noting the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles and a new-type 
Apache helicopter unit to South Korea and to send an aircraft 
carrier to the waters near the Korean peninsula, reporting that 
these moves suggest that the U.S. policy toward North Korea is 
moving in a hard-line direction. The article quotes THE 
WASHINGTON POST and THE WASHINGTON TIMES as reporting that the 
United States will replace the Cobra helicopters with new-type 
Apache helicopters and send an aircraft carrier to the waters 
near the Korean peninsula in an effort to strengthen the combat 
capabilities of the U.S. Forces in South Korea. The article 
also reports a Defense Department spokesman described the 
performance of the Patriot missiles at a briefing session. 
  CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,500-word 
article by reporter Kang Yong-chin on the meaning and background 
of the U.S. plan to strengthen U.S. Forces stationed in South 
Korea. Noting the background of the recent hard-line attitude 
toward North Korea by the hawkish group led by the Department of 
Defense and CIA in connection with the negotiations with North 
Korea the article cites: "After all, the U.S. State Department, 
which has insisted on the need to continue nuclear negotiations 
with North Korea has become to realize that its concessions to 
North Korea have been fruitless." 
  Noting the position of the ROK Government, which has assumed 
a prudent attitude toward the hard-line group led by the U.S. 
Department of Defense and CIA, the article concludes that the 
United States will continue to maintain a hard-line attitude 
toward North Korea "through the strengthening of its defense 
capability in South Korea in a bid to apply pressure on North 
Korea." 
  CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word 
article by reporter Pak Ui-chun describing in detail the 
background of the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot missiles to the 
ROK. The article reports that deployment of Patriot missiles, 
though it will contribute to strengthening the combat 
capabilities of the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea, will 
have a serious effect on alleviating tensions on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The article also quotes leaders of the opposition DP, 
including Chairman Yi Ki-taek, as expressing worries over the 
possible negative effect of the deployment of Patriot missiles 
on North-South dialogue and on easing tension on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The article concludes that the U.S. plan to deploy Patriot 
missiles to the ROK should be prudently reviewed, not only 
because it would dampen the negotiations of the North Korean 
nuclear issue, but also because it would create an arms race on 
the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The United States 
and the South Korean puppets are reportedly having consultations 
to hasten the projected deployment of Patriot missiles in South 
Korea. 
  It is an unpardonable grave military challenge to scheme to 
introduce Patriot missiles in South Korea at a time when 
DPRK-U.S. contacts have taken place and the third round of 
DPRK-U.S. talks are expected for a fundamental solution to the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
  It is self-evident that the deployment of Patriot missiles 
in 
South Korea will key up the tensions on the Korean peninsula and 
increase the danger of war. 
  This scheme vividly shows the reckless attempt of the United 
States and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique to contain the 
DPRK militarily has gone beyond the danger line. 
  The hostile forces of the United States and the South Korean 
puppet clique claim that the deployment of Patriot missiles is 
to "counter the threat of missile attack from North Korea." But 
this is no more than a crafty plea to justify their dangerous 
introduction of lethal weapons. 
  The real purpose of their massive shipment of Patriot 
missiles into South Korea under the pretext of "threat of 
missile attack" is to impede the progress of the DPRK-U.S. 
talks for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula and impose their unreasonable demand for 
"nuclear inspection" on the DPRK through pressure and threat. 
  The projected deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea 
is motivated by the persistent anti-socialist, anti- DPRK 
campaign of the United States. 
  Not content with the deployment of more than 1,000 nuclear 
weapons in South Korea, the traitor Kim Yong-sam allowed the 
introduction of Patriot missiles to kill fellow countrymen. By 
doing so, he revealed once again his true color as a heinous 
traitor, flunkeyist and "civilian" fascist outdistancing the 
preceding military fascist dictators. 
  If the United States and its followers think they can subdue 
the DPRK with pressure and threat, it is a big mistake. That 
method may lead the situation to a hopeless phase, far from 
resolving the problem. 
  The United States must look straight at the reality and act 
with discretion and drop at once the reckless plan of Patriot 
missile deployment in South Korea.

<F P=106> [Article by Yi Won-chae: "Improvement of the Combat </F>
Capabilities of the U.S. Forces in the ROK -- View of the ROK 
Defense Ministry"] 
  [Text] It has been reported recently that the United States 
plans to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopter 
battalions in the ROK and plans to relocate aircraft carriers to 
this region. The ROK Defense Ministry thinks that this would 
contribute to beefing up the combat capabilities of the U.S. 
Forces in the ROK. At the same time, it assumes a prudent 
attitude toward this issue. 
  The Defense Ministry is trying to minimize the importance of 
the report and says: "This plan is being carried out on a normal 
basis as part of the U.S. plan to modernize its forces in the 
ROK." 
  It says that the deployment of Patriot missiles in the ROK 
was decided at the 23d ROK-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting in 
October of 1991. Patriot missiles won a good reputation by 
intercepting Iraqi Scuds during the January 1991 Gulf war. 
After the war, the United States persistently asked the ROK to 
buy them. However, it decided to deploy them in the U.S. Forces 
in the ROK when the ROK concluded that they are not suitable to 
our geographical conditions. 
  The Defense Ministry anticipates Patriot missiles would be 
used to intercept MiG's in times of war because they are 
ground-to-air missiles and are capable of intercepting aircraft, 
even though the primary purpose of their deployment would be to 
intercept North Korean Nodong No. 1 missiles. 
  Military officials predict that they will be the latest 
generation of Patriot missiles whose capabilities to find 
targets and range have improved significantly and are capable of 
correctly intercepting and completely destroying enemy missiles' 
warheads in midair to minimize damage on the ground. 
  However, some military experts say the missiles may not 
prove 
efficient in the ROK because the battlefield depth is a mere 40 
km, the warning time for a North Korean attack is short, the 
missile's hit rate is a mere 50 to 60 percent, and because it is 
not appropriate to use the missiles in a populous area. They 
also say that 36 Patriot launchers are not enough to contain 
enemy air strikes because North Korea is expected to fly 
aircraft over 2,000 times a day in wartime. They also say the 
deployment of Patriot missiles is important in mitigating 
people's uneasiness over Nodong No. 1 missiles. 
  Military officials concerned also say replacing the Cobra 
helicopter unit with two Apache helicopter divisions is part of 
the 1989 ROK-U.S. joint defense capability improvement plan. 
  Apache attack helicopters annihilated Iraqi tank units 
during 
the Gulf war. The helicopters are armed with devices to 
automatically identify and pursue targets, with night firing 
devices, and (Hydra) 70-mm rockets. The two-seater Apache flies 
at 270 km an hour and weighs 9,525 kg. 
  The Defense Ministry says the deployment of aircraft 
carriers 
on the Korean peninsula is related to the decision made at the 
1993 ROK-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting to transfer the 
wartime operational command over the 7th U.S. Fleet to the 
commander of the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command: In an 
emergency, aircraft carriers would be rapidly deployed to the 
Korean peninsula as part of the rapid deterrence forces concept. 
It is expected that the 7th Fleet's ultramodern aircraft 
carrier Carl Vinson (91,400 tonnes) and conventional aircraft 
carrier Independence (86,000 tonnes) would be deployed. 
  The Defense Ministry considers these U.S. deployment plans 
to 
be a carrot-and-stick strategy for its nuclear negotiations with 
North Korea because these plans were mapped out long ago and 
because there is nothing worrisome about North Korea's current 
military situation.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and editorials published in Seoul vernacular newspapers 
on 29 January on the possible deployment of Patriot missiles to 
the ROK. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 
800-word editorial entitled "Patriot Is for Defensive Use." The 
editorial notes that "the Patriot missile is a defensive 
weapon," and that the use of such a weapon is "by no means to 
attack North Korea," but to prepare for a possible attack by 
offensive weapons, such as the Nodong-1 and Nodong-2 missiles, 
which North Korea is currently developing. The editorial views 
that "if the South side does not take any defensive measures at 
a time when North Korea is developing offensive weapons, it 
would be relinquishing our security." The editorial reports 
China expressed opposition to the plan of deploying the Patriot 
missiles by noting: "This is an act threatening security and 
peace on the Korean peninsula." The editorial goes on to note 
that our opposition party [Democratic Party of South Korea] said 
that the plan to deploy the Patriot missiles may provoke North 
Korea. The editorial criticizes the opposition party's remark, 
noting that the opposition party does not know which side is 
committing acts that threaten peace on the Korean peninsula. 
The editorial concludes: "If North Korea changes its position 
and gives up the development of offensive weapons, then the plan 
to deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK will lose its 
justification." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 1 a 
500-word article by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok on 
the plan to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to 
the U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK and to send an aircraft 
carrier to the waters near the Korean peninsula. The article 
reports this is to "prepare for a possible threat by North Korea 
if the UN Security Council decides to apply economic sanctions 
against North Korea." The article quotes a Washington 
diplomatic source as stating that "this is part of a 
comprehensive operational plan to prepare for a possible state 
of emergency that may occur on the Korean peninsula." The 
article reports that a U.S. Defense Department spokesman 
confirmed that "the deployment of the Patriot missiles to the 
ROK is being promoted" and that "when a final decision is made, 
the U.S. Forces in the ROK will possess an improved model of the 
Patriot missile." The article notes it has been confirmed there 
are plans to deploy Apache helicopters to the ROK as part of the 
U.S. plan to modernize its weapons. The article concludes that 
the Patriot missiles will be deployed to Air Force bases in 
Pusan, Taegu, and Kunsan to serve as a strategic defensive base, 
rather than for the defense of the metropolitan area. 
  HANGUK ILBO in Korean on page 2 publishes a 1,000-word 
article by Washington correspondent Chong Chin-sok on the true 
nature of the new moves by the United States regarding the 
security situation of the Korean peninsula. The article notes 
that diplomatic circles in Washington are showing interest in 
U.S. moves regarding the Korean peninsula. The article explains 
that the United States is a "super power" militarily, but it 
needs the approval of the people to use its power. adding that 
"the situation on the Korean peninsula is no exception." The 
article notes "what the United States truly wants is not to be 
prepared for a war, but to strengthen deterrent power to prevent 
the outbreak of a war." The article notes that such moves by 
the United States are a means to put the finishing touches on 
the negotiations regarding North Korea's nuclear issue. The 
article notes that we cannot overlook the fact that the ROK may 
be used as a major weapons market by the U.S. defense industry. 
The article reports: "There are rumors that core figures of 
the U.S. defense industry in Washington secretly visited the ROK 
and met with high-ranking officials to discuss the sale of the 
Patriots." The article notes that the recent moves of the U.S. 
military are an ultimatum to North Korea regarding the 
settlement of its nuclear issue and to confirm to Northeast 
Asian countries, including Japan and China, U.S. presence in 
this region. The article concludes: "Moves for the increase of 
U.S. capability in the ROK cannot by any means be limited to the 
Korean peninsula issue." 
  HANGUK ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 800-word 
editorial entitled: "Unusual Atmosphere on the Korean 
Peninsula." The editorial notes "the ROK Government is 
remaining silent" about U.S. plans to deploy Patriot missiles 
and Apache helicopters and to send an aircraft carrier to the 
waters around the Korean peninsula in case of a possible 
military provocation on the South by North Korea. The editorial 
notes that the people are worried about this matter because "the 
United States and North Korea reached an agreement in principle 
regarding the nuclear issue late last year and that negotiations 
are under way between the International Atomic Energy Agency and 
North Korea on the method for inspection of North Korea's 
nuclear facilities." The editorial elaborates on the pros and 
cons of the United States increasing its capability. The 
editorial notes that the people are curious about "the concrete 
content of the proposal for the settlement of the nuclear issue 
as agreed upon between the United States and North Korea, its 
progress, the real reason for the United States to increase its 
capability in the ROK, and the nature of U.S.-ROK consultations 
at this time." The editorial urges the government to be clear 
about these matters and explain everything to the people. The 
editorial concludes: "How the situation develops and how 
rapidly changes are made on the Korean peninsula are directly 
related to our security, right to live, and interest." 
  The liberal TONG-A ILBO in Korean publishes on page 1 a 
900-word article on the issue of "deployment of ultramodern 
weapons for U.S. forces in the ROK." Noting this issue was 
revealed by the U.S. side first, the article emphasizes the ROK 
Government's "politico-military measures" regarding the issue. 
The article then reports the remark by a high-ranking 
security-related official on the report on the U.S. plan to 
deploy Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters to the ROK that 
"this plan has been included in the equipment modernization 
program of the U.S. Forces in the ROK for three to five years." 
  Asked if the weapons buildup was an indication of a 
"military 
provocation" by North Korea, the official stated: "There is no 
abnormal situation we should cope with at present," adding, "the 
necessity of such pressing measures for nuclear negotiations 
with North Korea should be reviewed from a political and 
military standpoint." 
  Referring to remarks of military officials, the article 
notes 
that "the question of deploying weapons at this time may cause a 
lot of controversy." The article quotes a statement by 
government authorities that "the recent U.S. report on projected 
Patriot missiles deployment, on dispatch of a state intelligence 
support team to the ROK, and on introduction of Apache 
helicopters, has led to the impression of heightened 'tensions' 
on the Korean peninsula. Thus, the government expressed its hope 
to the United States that the U.S. military authorities will 
refrain from leaking intelligence." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 1 
a 300-word article by Washington-based correspondent Kim 
Hak-sun. The article reports: "It was learned on 27 January that 
the U.S. Government is strongly hoping that the ROK Government 
will purchase Patriot missiles, which it is considering 
deploying on the Korean peninsula to counter Scud missile 
attacks by North Korea." The article noted that a diplomatic 
source in Washington observed that "the U.S. Government's plan 
to increase military power, including deployment of Apache 
helicopters in the ROK and dispatch of aircraft carriers to the 
coast of the Korean peninsula, is related to the weapons sale 
strategy of U.S. military industries toward the ROK." 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word 
editorial entitled "Is the Korean Peninsula Uneasy?" Noting that 
the report on the U.S. arms buildup plan on the Korean peninsula 
is arousing "a sense of vague uneasiness" instead of "a feeling 
of relief" regarding security, the editorial points out that the 
report on deployment of Patriot missiles and Apache helicopters 
and on the dispatch of aircraft carriers will "evoke a sense of 
military tension," and refers to the "general observation" that 
such measures are "means of diplomatic pressure" on North Korea 
to accept nuclear inspections. The editorial reports that while 
negotiations are under way, such measures may possibly "irritate 
North Korea" and cause a "negative influence" on the 
negotiations. 
  Stressing that "military issues should be advanced in 
secret," the editorial expresses misgivings that the disclosure 
of such plans might have "diplomatic and military purposes." 
Referring to an explanation by government authorities of the 
U.S. plan to deploy weapons, the editorial reports that the ROK 
Government has failed to "consult sufficiently" with the U.S. 
Government on reinforcement of U.S. forces in the ROK and that 
our government has been "dragged" into U.S. policy on "the 
military situation" on the Korean peninsula, rather than 
"positively coping with this situation." 
  The editorial calls on the government to give "a clear 
explanation on the true aspects" to the people and stresses that 
"concentration of ultramodern weapons on the Korean peninsula 
during an atmosphere of detente is not desirable."

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 29 [date as received] (KCNA) -- 
The United States and the South Korean authorities are 
reportedly having consultations to hasten the projected 
deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea. 
  It is an unpardonable grave military challenge of keying up 
the tensions on the Korean peninsula to scheme to introduce 
Patriot missiles in South Korea at a time when DPRK-U.S. 
contacts have taken place and the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks 
are expected for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  The hostile forces of the United States and the South Korean 
puppet clique claim that the deployment of Patriot missiles is 
to "counter the threat of missile attack from North Korea." But 
this is no more than a plea to justify their dangerous 
introduction of lethal weapons. 
  The real purpose of their massive shipment of Patriot 
missiles into South Korea under the pretext of "threat of 
missile attack" is to impede the progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks 
for a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula and impose their unreasonable demand for "nuclear 
inspection" on the DPRK through pressure and threat. 
  If the United States and its followers think they can subdue 
the DPRK with pressure and threat, it is a big mistake. That 
method may lead the situation to a hopeless phase, far from 
resolving the problem.

  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 1 (YONHAP) -- Seoul and Washington are 
reportedly out of step over the timing of deploying U.S. Patriot 
missiles in South Korea, with the Americans wanting to execute 
the plan as soon as possible while the Koreans are in no hurry. 
  The two governments, currently discussing deployment of 
Patriot missiles on the Korean peninsula, are considering some 
time in March or April, a senior Seoul official said Tuesday. 
  Korea is in no hurry to deploy the missiles as there are no 
clear signs of a threat to the Korean peninsula, while the 
United States wants deployment to take place as soon as 
possible, producing the difference of opinion, the official said. 
  Seoul, fearing that the missile deployment may provoke 
Pyongyang and sidetrack the process of resolving the North 
Korean nuclear problem, wants to watch the progress of the 
nuclear talks before making a decision, he said.

<F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "A Total of 160 Russian Nuclear </F>
Scientists and Missilemen Helped North Korea To Create a Nuclear 
Bomb. The Japanese Have Learned This from a Secret Report by 
the Russian General Staff"] 
  [Text] Tokyo -- The Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN carries 
a detailed account of a secret report on North Korean nuclear 
affairs prepared by the Russian General Staff and an interview 
with an unnamed official involved in compiling that report, 
referred to in a note as "a leader." The report is entitled 
"The Russian Federation's Military Policy in the Asia and 
Pacific Region Under the New Military-Political Conditions." 
  It seems that more can be seen from the top of our General 
Staff building than from the U.S., Japanese, or NATO 
counterparts. At any rate, Russian specialists and analysts are 
more candid on the problem of the North Korean nuclear program 
and stricter in their judgments than their Western colleagues, 
who recently have repeatedly shared information with journalists 
-- true, their own journalists, not foreigners. It follows from 
the report, prepared for Grachev and then forwarded to Yeltsin 
(according to the Japanese magazine, which was told all this by 
our talkative secret agents in Moscow), that Pyongyang has 
scored major achievements in implementing a missile program and 
a nuclear program. The DPRK already has its own nuclear 
warheads and several hundred delivery vehicles capable of 
delivering the payload. 
  It is clear from the Russian report, and from the mysterious 
"leader's" comments on it, that Pyongyang embarked with 
particular zeal on its nuclear missile program in the second 
half of the eighties, with active Russian participation. Almost 
160 Russian nuclear scientists and missilemen have passed 
through North Korean laboratories and specialized centers since 
then. At present nine Russian nuclear scientists and 17 highly 
qualified missile specialists are working in North Korea. This 
is outside the framework of bilateral cooperation and is 
unofficial, as it were -- according to the "leader's" comments, 
many of our scientists have changed their names, and some have 
taken DPRK citizenship. Only it is not this that is important 
but the fact that the project to create the Korean Nodong-1 
intermediate-range missile was successfully completed with the 
assistance of Russian brains, and North Korea has accumulated a 
sufficient stock of enriched nuclear raw materials with the help 
of Russian scientists and technologies and now possesses 
approximately 10-12 kg of uranium-235 and 20 kg of 
plutonium-239. Citing the testimonies of four Russian 
specialists who recently returned from the DPRK after working in 
Korean nuclear complexes, the report maintains that Pyongyang 
already possesses one or two nuclear warheads and by the end of 
this year will roll several more off the conveyor belt. The 
DPRK is now engaged in creating a new generation of Nodong-2 
solid-fuel missiles with an increased hit range. According to 
Russian estimates, in the very near future our fuel technologies 
and know-how and our missile scientists and solid-fuel 
specialists will be objects of special attention for Pyongyang's 
agents. 
  In this connection the report proposes revising all existing 
technological agreements between Russia and the DPRK, stopping 
the leak of cadres, and devoting special attention to 
bridge-building with the United States, South Korea, and Japan 
for extensive coordination of actions. It is even proposed that 
we think about the prospect of creating some kind of regional 
ABM system involving Russia, Japan, and the United States. At 
the same time it is pointed out that not only Russia but also 
China has been involved in the DPRK's nuclear affairs, and the 
Chinese factor is now becoming the key one. 
  The document cited at length by the Japanese magazine is 
stamped "top secret" and was prepared by the Russian Defense 
Ministry General Staff Military-Strategic Analysis Center. 
After being read by Grachev and Yeltsin, extracts from the 
report were forwarded on the president's instructions to the 
U.S. Defense Department (within the framework of an information 
exchange). A facsimile of a Russian Defense Ministry form with 
the issue number 001 SM-137 and date of publication 22 October 
1993 is even given as an illustration. In short, there are no 
doubts about the authenticity of the document itself, but some 
questions do arise, and it makes sense to ask them. The first 
and most important question: On what unspecified grounds does 
Russian General Staff information get into Japanese hands, 
accompanied, moreover, by detailed comments and explanations by 
a "leader" working, to judge from the wording employed by the 
weekly, in the structure of the General Staff itself? Maybe no 
major secrets have been divulged, but the question needs to be 
answered if only for one reason -- a Japanese audience is the 
first to learn about the Russian military department's 
assessments, while the Russian audience, as is already the 
custom, is considered "second class." 
  Second question: On what terms and in what circumstances did 
the Japanese weekly obtain exclusive material from the Russian 
Defense Ministry? If it was on instructions from chiefs 
conducting an intricate publicity operation, I would like to 
have an idea of that intention. If it was without the chiefs' 
knowledge, it would be even better to know the whereabouts of 
the secret key which opens Russian General Staff safes for 
Japanese guests. 
  Finally, a third question, again one of considerable 
importance: Who in Japan (or some other country) will be the 
next happy possessor of Russian secret documents? If the 
Russian mass media are not old enough to have the honor of being 
the first to learn the Russian military department's viewpoint, 
they must at least get their bearings in the information area 
and know in which foreign journal or newspaper it will be 
possible to familiarize themselves with the views of their own 
Defense Ministry.

<F P=106> [Observer Aleksandr Golts report on interview with Colonel </F>
General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Armed Forces General 
Staff; place and date of interview not given: "`General Staff 
Secret Report' in Fact Blatant Forgery. Chief of Russian 
Federation Armed Forces General Staff Refutes Articles in 
Japanese Weekly and IZVESTIYA"] 
  [Text] The popular Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN has 
published material which, if it were true, would cause an 
international sensation; the respected Russian newspaper 
IZVESTIYA has given a detailed account of this material. Citing 
a secret document from the Russian General Staff and an 
interview with an anonymous staffer from this organization, it 
is reported that Russia is allegedly assisting the 
implementation of North Korea's nuclear missile plans. Also, 
that our nuclear and rocket scientists have helped to develop 
the nuclear weapons [boyepripasy] which, it seems, the DPRK 
already possesses as well as the means to deliver these weapons. 
Moreover, it is claimed that, in the Russian military's 
assessment, the situation is so grave that the issue of 
establishing a joint system of ABM defense for Russia, Japan, 
and the United States needs to be addressed. 
  But it is probably no accident that neither the actual 
magazine nor IZVESTIYA has attempted to ascertain whether this 
document is genuine by making inquiries at its alleged source. 
  In reply to my question as to whether such a document really 
exists, Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Armed 
Forces General Staff, answered: "The articles in the Japanese 
magazine and IZVESTIYA are based on a gross and obvious forgery. 
It is only to be regretted that such a respected newspaper has 
fallen victim to forgers by publishing this material from its 
Japan correspondent Sergey Agafonov without any preliminary 
verification." 
  Indeed, it can only be conjectured why the photograph of the 
first page of the "document" was thought sufficient to remove 
all doubts as to the authenticity of the report. After all, it 
is unlikely that IZVESTIYA employs people specializing in the 
clerical work of the Ministry of Defense who would be able to 
distinguish a genuine document from a forgery. People who deal 
with office paperwork, however, are adamant that the Ministry of 
Defense never uses the kind of document serial numbers indicated 
in the article. But if this is the case, the ironic questions in 
the article addressed to the ministry and the General Staff are 
still left hanging in the air. After all, if no leaks took 
place, any hint that there is a little key which "opens General 
Staff safes for Japanese guests" is simply an insult. 
  However, other questions are now being raised. In 
particular, what was the point of publishing these unverified 
reports. Col. Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov believes that "we are 
talking about a clear provocation with the aim of casting 
aspersions on the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff." 
Can it be that someone actually wants to rekindle the antiarmy 
campaign of the past few years? 
  At the same time the chief of General Staff is not ruling 
out 
the possibility that this episode has played into the hands of 
those who want to complicate relations between Russia and North 
Korea. 
  Yes, the nuclear problems of the Korean peninsula are 
currently very acute. Russia is not hiding its alarm at the 
fact that the DPRK has suspended its participation in the Treaty 
on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons. At the same time, a 
ranking Russian diplomat stated recently, we believe that 
sanctions against the DPRK -- on which some countries are 
insisting -- should be used only as a last resort. But there 
are those who would prefer to replace the complex process of 
negotiations with open pressure on Pyongyang. And is it not 
currently in their interests to make it seem as if Russia is to 
blame for the fact that the DPRK has allegedly acquired nuclear 
weapons?

  [Text] Moscow, January 31 (KCNA) -- The Russian paper 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA January 28 reported that the chief of general 
staff of the Russian Armed Forces refuted the report of the 
Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN about Russia's assistance in the 
missile and nuclear program of North Korea. 
  The chief of general staff, according to the paper said the 
report of the Japanese weekly was based on a rude and open false 
document and it was a clear provocation motivated by the 
intention to throw a shadow on the Ministry of Defence and the 
general staff of Russia. 
  The paper said: 
  At the same time, the chief of general staff did not rule 
out 
that this would be beneficial only to those who seek to 
complicate the relations between Russia and North Korea. 
  That is right. The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is 
now presenting itself as a very crucial matter. As was stated 
recently by a high-ranking Russian diplomat, we consider the 
sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 
which some countries insist are the worst means. Worse still, 
there are people who are trying to turn the complicated process 
of talks into an open pressure on Pyongyang. 
  It is not good to them to accuse Russia now of having helped 
the DPRK possess nuclear weapons. Is it?

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>
  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- The reports of some mass 
media that Russian scientists participated in creation of 
nuclear weapons in Pyongyang absolutely contradict the reality, 
Ambassador of North Korea in Moscow Son Sung-pil told ITAR-TASS 
on Friday. 
  North Korea never had a military nuclear programme. The 
research in atomic energy was of an exclusively peaceful 
character, he noted. 
  The ambassador said the former Soviet Union rendered 
assistance to North Korea in various spheres. In those years, 
Soviet specialists, including nuclear energy experts, worked in 
the republic. However, now there are no Russian atomic experts 
in North Korea. 
  According to Son Sung-pil, Japanese mass media are 
initiators 
of various fabrications on the topic. It is not by accident, 
because "Japan has all the necessary components for creating 
nuclear weapons," he said. 
  "It is quite possible that certain circles of that country 
are interested that the world community's attention is attracted 
by the fuss about the alleged threat from North Korea, using it 
as a ground and excuse to create their own atomic bomb," the 
ambassador stressed.

<F P=106> [By Yi Sok-ku from Tokyo] </F>
  [Text] In a dispatch from Vladivostok on 3 February, 
Japan's TOKYO SHIMBUN reported that when submarines that were to 
be sold to North Korea became an issue in the international 
community, Russia decided to stop delivering them to North Korea. 
  The paper, which carried exclusive news of Russia's plan to 
sell submarines to North Korea, sent a reporter to the (Novik) 
port in Vladivostok -- which is the prohibited area for 
foreigners -- and held an interview with a relevant official 
there. He said that Russia had decided to stop delivering 
submarines to North Korea. 
  Having obtained contract documents regarding transactions 
for 
the submarines that were to be sold to North Korea, the paper 
carried commentary on the documents on 3 February along with 
submarine photos. 
  The paper reported that although a relevant Russian military 
officer had said that they were "exporting scrap materials, not 
submarines," it was more likely that Russia was selling them as 
weapons as it has been confirmed that a North Korean 
high-ranking naval officer was directly involved in negotiations 
for the submarines. 
  The paper reported: Although Golf II Class submarines, which 
were to be sold to North Korea this time, appear to be largely 
scrap material, their facilities, including operational 
functions, remain functional. 
  According to the data furnished to the paper, the Management 
Bureau of the Resources External Affairs of the Russian Defense 
Ministry and the Japanese Toyen trade corporation (head office 
in Tokyo) signed the contract on 16-19 November last year. 
  The price of the 12 Russian submarines are as follows: Two 
of the submarines are $140,000 based on price of $51 per ton and 
ten submarines, at $92 per ton, amount to $1.15 million. One of

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, 24 Jan -- The Japanese Government expects to 
conclude by March this year outline agreements with three 
republics of the former Soviet Union, excluding Russia, on 
assistance in scrapping the nuclear weapons they have inherited 
after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The ITAR-TASS 
correspondent learned this today at the Japanese Foreign 
Ministry. 
  In the words of a member of the disarmament section at the 
Japanese Foreign Ministry, diplomats from Tokyo are conducting 
talks in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to decide what share 
each of the three republics is to receive of the $100 million 
Japan allocated to the CIS in April 1993 to facilitate the 
scrapping of nuclear weapons and the utilization of radioactive 
waste. 
  The Japanese assistance is to be directed toward 
facilitating 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections at 
military and civilian nuclear facilities in these countries, and 
toward ensuring the safe storage of fissile materials. Specific 
programs will also envisage sending to the spot Japanese 
specialists from nuclear power stations and nuclear waste 
depositories, as well as teaching Japanese experience to local 
staff. 
  Tokyo has decided to expedite the process of drafting 
outline 
agreements in view of the fact that Ukraine and Kazakhstan have 
recently adopted a constructive stand concerning accession to 
the Nuclear Arms Non-Proliferation Treaty, and that Kiev has 
guaranteed the withdrawal of this type of weapons from its 
territory.

<F P=106> [Mikhail Shimanskiy report on interview with Valeriy </F>
Tsepkalo, adviser to the chairman of the Belarusian Supreme 
Soviet on foreign economic issues -- date not given: "After 
Ukraine, Belarus Claims Its Share of Uranium"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The Belarusian leadership is concerned 
about the agreement signed in Moscow by Clinton, Yeltsin, and 
Kravchuk. And during the U.S. President's visit to Minsk the 
extremely delicate question of Belarus's share of the materials 
from the elimination of warheads was raised. IZVESTIYA's 
correspondent asked Valeriy Tsepkalo, the chairman of the 
republic Supreme Soviet's adviser on foreign economic questions, 
to comment on this situation. 
  "The question of the share of the uranium in the tactical 
and 
strategic nuclear weapons being withdrawn from Belarusian 
territory has been discussed in talks between ourselves and 
Russia," Valeriy Tsepkalo explained. 
  "Moscow and Washington formerly prepared an agreement on the 
sale to the United States of the uranium released as a result of 
the elimination of the nuclear warheads on strategic offensive 
weapons. At that time the United States reassured Kazakhstan, 
Belarus, and Ukraine that the agreement would not be signed 
before the question of the distribution of revenue from the sale 
of the uranium was settled. Nevertheless, the United States and 
Russia did sign the agreement. But the United States has 
assured us that the agreement will not come into force until 
agreement is reached on the distribution of the revenue. The 
United States is buying 500 tonnes of uranium over 20 years at a 
cost of $5.5 billion." 
  "The agreement between the United States, Russia, and 
Ukraine 
contains provisions which establish Ukraine's share of uranium 
sales, either in money or in kind -- that is to say, through the 
delivery of industrial uranium for Ukrainian nuclear power 
stations. And most important of all, Ukraine has succeeded in 
resolving the problem of tactical nuclear weapons; in other 
words Russia has agreed to recognize Ukraine's right to the 
fissionable materials in the tactical weapons and count their 
number when determining the profit from the sale of uranium." 
  "For us this is very important. Russia has not recognized 
our right to that quantity of fissionable materials in the 
nuclear weapons withdrawn from Belarus through 27 April 1992. 
But after all, almost half of all the tactical nuclear weapons 
of the former USSR were situated on the republic's territory." 
  "Russia has claimed that the lion's share of the revenue 
from 
the sale of uranium will go toward covering the expense of 
destroying the weapons. However, this does not correspond to 
reality, since Russia has received considerable sums for these 
very purposes from the United States." 
  "We consider it possible to begin talks with Russia about 
our 
share of the profits with the mediation of the United States -- 
that is to say, to prepare an agreement similar to the one 
signed in Moscow."

<F P=106> [Jaroslav Kmenta and Jiri Bigas report: "Iran Suspected </F>
Skodaexport Employee of Spying"] 
  [Text] The Iranian intelligence service suspected Ladislav 
Tyl, a Skodaexport representative detained in Iran last year 
under so far unexplained circumstances, of espionage. This was 
reported by a diplomatic source that does not wish to be 
identified in order to avoid difficulties in office. 
  Skodaexport Director General Jan Ricica, however, rejects 
the 
espionage charge. "Espionage activity is completely 
unrealistic," he said. He emphasized that following the 
intervention of the Czech ambassador to Tehran, Tyl was released 
with the explanation that the suspicions had not been confirmed. 
  Tyl was arrested shortly after the departure of the Skoda 
Plzen delegation that had visited Tehran to establish business 
contacts and also discussed the possibility of supplying Iran 
with modernized T-72 tanks. While some sources place Tyl's 
arrest precisely in the context of Skoda Plzen Director General 
Lubomir Soudek's business negotiations, Ricica said that such a 
connection seem unlikely to him. Nevertheless, Tyl participated 
in all Soudek's meetings in Tehran. 
  The Skodaexport director general also said that he could not 
think of any reason for detaining Tyl. "Since there was no 
indication of any links with the Skodaexport business activities 
in the course of the incident, we are certain it must have been 
a misunderstanding or a case of mistaken identity," he declared. 
  The Skoda Plzen business mission to Iran created suspicion 
among some intelligence services that Skoda is trying to acquire 
a share not only in supplies of conventional arms, but also of 
technology for the Iranian nuclear program. 
  Tyl was detained by Iranian security on 7 December last 
year, 
and released five days later. He had worked in Iran for almost 
four years. Following the incident, however, he returned home. 
The arrest cut his planned stay in Iran by approximately 14 
days. 
  In response to our question, the Iranian Foreign Ministry, 
through its Prague embassy, refused to comment on the 
circumstances of Tyl's arrest. 
  According to experts on this area, it cannot be ruled out 
that the Iranian security service was attempting to find out 
whether Tyl had any information about the Iranian nuclear 
program. 
  Ricica considers Tyl's arrest a thing of the past. He says 
he does not expect it to have an impact on future business 
cooperation.

  [Excerpt] The prime minister of the Czech Republic, Vaclav 
Klaus, has denied that companies in his country are selling 
nuclear technology, along with other weapons, to Iran. Speaking 
to reporters during the second day of his official visit to 
Israel, he was today lecturing at the Hebrew University. More 
from reporter Dick Winter: 
  [Begin recording] Winter: Dr. Vaclav Klaus, in 
his first visit to Israel, met this morning with his former 
economic adviser: the governor of the Bank of Israel, Ya'aqov 
Frenkel. Frenkel, in 1986 a senior official in the 
International Monetary Fund, helped Dr. Klaus to plan the new 
Czech Republic's emerging free market economy. 
  But reporters' first question to the visiting prime minister 
was about the charges that the Czech firm Skoda, one of the 
Czech Republic's largest companies, is selling nuclear 
technology, along with other weapons, to Iran. 
  Klaus: Well, I must say those are just rumors and 
speculations usually created by the competition in the Western 
European countries, in the United States companies which want to 
catch the markets themselves and try in advance to send rumors 
to undermine the Czech position. Simply that's not true.

  [Text] Kiev, 10 Feb (UKRINFORM-TASS) -- A telephone 
conversation took place today between German Federal Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  During the conversation Leonid Kravchuk gave explanations on 
the question of the elimination of nuclear weapons and also 
touched on bilateral Ukrainian-German relations. He stressed 
that Ukraine is fulfilling its obligations connected with moving 
toward nonnuclear status. It was also stressed that the 
fulfilment of these obligations entails a vast financial 
expenditure that is an inordinate burden on the Ukrainian 
economy. In this connection a request was made to Germany to 
give financial and technical assistance for Ukraine to fulfil 
its obligtions to eliminate nuclear weapons. There was also 
discussion of expanding economic relations between the two 
states. 
  For his part, the federal chancellor expressed understanding 
of the problems that Ukraine is tackling and stressed that 
Germany desires that Ukraine should maintain its sovereignty and 
move successfully along the path of reforms. 
  The leaders of the two states agreed on specific steps that 
will be made toward the further development of relations between 
Ukraine and Germany.

  [Text] Moscow, Dec. 16 (PTI)--The Russian foreign minister, 
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, has said that cryogenic engine technology has 
military applications and therefore Russia had to, for its own 
security, alter the contract with India. 
  Speaking on Russian television last night, Mr Kozyrev said 
that proliferation of missiles in Asia would only negatively 
affect Russian security. 
  "How can we allow India and not allow, for example, 
Pakistan," he queried during the interview. 
  Mr Kozyrev said that another reason for not allowing the 
transfer of technology was that India has had conflicts with 
some of its neighbours and transfer of this technology would 
only increase tension in the area. 
  Mr Kozyrev stressed that India fully understood Russia's 
stand on the issue and the alteration of the contract had not 
affected Indo-Russian relations. 
  "Relations are good. Mr Yeltsin visited India in January. 
Trade and economic relations are also growing," he added. 
  Mr Kozyrev brought up the cryogenic deal in the course of 
the 
interview as an illustration of the "myths" spread by the 
ultra-nationalists, alleging that the government was betraying 
Russian national interests. 
  "Let's assume that there is a proliferation of rockets in 
Asia. These will be closer to Russia than to the United States. 
Then in whose interest is it, to ensure that this does not 
happen?" he asked. 
  Mr Kozyrev's statement, however, raises more questions than 
it answers, according to observers here. 
  If Russia was aware that the technology had military 
applications, then why did it insist that the rockets and the 
technology could not be used for military purposes and why did 
it offer to prove that in front of an international panel of 
experts? asked a Russian specialist. 
  In this context, he then questioned the wisdom of Mr 
Yeltsin's statement in January in New Delhi that Russia would 
fulfill its commitments to India on the deal. 
  Indian and Russian experts had insisted in the past that the 
engines and technology had no military application and in any 
case India intended to use it only for its peaceful space 
research programme.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Radyuhin: "Rocket Deal With Russia </F>
`Renegotiated'"] 
  [Text] Moscow, Jan. 5. Russian space officials are 
optimistic that the cryogenic rocket deal with India will be 
carried through despite Moscow's refusal to supply related 
technology as envisaged by the original contract. 
  The head of the Russian space agency, Glavkosmos, Mr. Yuri 
Koptev, told a local news agency that India would receive two 
extra cryogenic boosters as compensation for technical aid that 
Russia was forced to cancel. Russia will also supply equipment 
for the testing and exploitation of cryo-engines. 
  The 1991 contract provided for the delivery of two cryogenic 
rocket boosters along with the knowhow for their manufacture in 
India. However, last year Moscow bowed to U.S. pressure not to 
transfer the cryogenic technology because it allegedly violated 
the Missile Technology Control Regime designed to prevent the 
spread of military rocket technology to developing nations. 
  Mr. Koptev said the delivery of extra boosters would keep 
the 
initial value of the contract "virtually intact" at about 228 
million U.S. dollars. India has already paid Russia about 60 per 
cent of the cost. 
  Not yet finalised: The cryogenic contract was 
renegotiated during a visit to India last month by a Russian 
space delegation led by the head of the Glavkosmos, Mr. 
Alexander Dunayev. However, diplomatic sources in Moscow said 
the new terms of the contract were yet to be approved by both 
sides. 
  Meanwhile, a Russian daily has reported that an additional 
agreement has been reached by Moscow and Delhi for the supply to 
India of three more cryogenic boosters at a cost of $3 millions 
each. 
  The Rossiiskiye Vesti daily, published by the 
Russian government, said the new contract would enable India to 
pursue its space exploration programme, although it would have 
to adjust it to the changed terms of the 1991 contract. 
According to the paper, additional boosters will be supplied in 
1996, after the fulfilment of the main contract.

  [Text] Energy Minister Moshe Shahal has turned down an 
offer from Russia to sell nuclear technology to Israel. The 
minister has just returned from a visit to Russia, which 
included a tour of a nuclear power plant. The minister 
explained why he refused the offer: 
  [Begin Shahal recording] I am not in favor of entering or 
buying existing technology for nuclear power plants. I think 
that Israel and probably the world will have to wait many years 
for a new technology, a safer technology. The Russians 
mentioned that in the past, during the time when Professor Yuval 
Ne'eman was the minister of energy and afterwards in a meeting 
with Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, there were talks by the Israeli 
Government to have a sort of a joint venture for a nuclear power 
plant. I mentioned and I explained our policy that we are more 
interested in the scientific question, in cooperation together 
maybe with Russia and the United States, but for future 
technologies, not the existing ones. Basically, I would say the 
government is not involved in buying energy supply as it was 
some years ago. I explained the new structure that we have 
here. [end recording]

  [Text] Tallinn, January 25 -- Arms shipment for Estonia's 
Defence Forces from Israel worth $40 million was discharged at 
the Port of Tallinn on January 23, reliable sources told ETA. 
  Estonian government on January 7, 1993 concluded a $60 
million agreement with state-owned Israeli arms company TAAS 
under which the company must supply Estonia with arms by end of 
1995 and Estonia must makes payments by 2000. 
  The deal brought about a political uproar in Estonia 
resulting in ratification of the deal at Riigikogu's closed 
session on December 15 last year with 57 affirmative votes 
against 10 negative and two abstentions. 
  "The deal with Israel does not so much increase Estonian 
national defence than the will to defend Estonian state," Rein 
Helme, deputy head of the parliament's state defence commission, 
said. 
  Estonia bought from Israel automatic rifles Galil (5.56 mm 
caliber), machine guns Negev (5.56 mm), submachine guns 
Mini-Uzi, sniper's rifles, grenade launchers, mortars, 
antiaircraft guns, missiles, ammunition, radio transmitters. 
  First shipment arrived in Estonia last summer.

five-decade respite from its insistent nuclear waste disposal 
headache caused by Russia's stubborn reluctance to admit 
Ukraine's nuclear fuel waste material to its reprocessing 
facilities now that the Zaporizhye nuclear power plant 
production association is reported to have signed a contract 
with the U.S. Duke Power company for construction of nuclear 
waste storage facilities. The contract materialized as a result 
of an international contest for nuclear waste disposal projects 
that the production association had to organize in view of the 
relevant governmental bodies' obvious indifference, inaction, 
and incompetence. 
  The contest reportedly drew participants and tenders from 
Germany, Britain, France, Canada, the United States, Spain, and 
[word indistinct]. The Zaporizhye nuclear power plant 
management chose the project drafted by the Duke engineering and 
service affiliates of the Duke Power company (?as specially) 
following the Ukrainian nuclear power industry's technological 
[word indistinct] and requirements. The project reportedly 
provides for storing used nuclear fuel cases in armored concrete 
cylinders. Despite their relative simplicity and cheapness, 
they are said to be both durable and reliable for storing 
fissionable materials, nuclear safety experts maintain. 
Currently, ecological and feasibility studies are under way in 
these sites. If everything goes well, the first storage 
facility is expected to be completed by late 1995. Similar 
storage facilities are being contemplated for construction at 
other Ukrainian nuclear power plants.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent William Waack in Berlin] </F>
  [Text] Germany is prepared to renounce its nuclear 
agreement with Brazil, suspend any transfer of high technology 
(including that for submarines and space exploration), and 
withdraw its support for the Brazilian candidacy to a permanent 
seat in the future UN Security Council unless the Brazilian 
Senate ratifies those treaties whereby Brazilian nuclear 
activities are subjected to international inspections and 
controls. The governments of Brazil and Germany are concerned 
about the Senate's position, which could markedly undermine the 
visit Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim will make to Bonn 
late this month. 
  The main items on the agenda of Brazilian-German relations 
-- 
including technological cooperation to be implemented by the 
private sector -- now depends on the position of the Brazilian 
Government on the subject of nonproliferation of nuclear 
technology. In Bonn, the seat of the German Government, there 
exists the conviction that the overall credibility of the German 
foreign policy -- especially in the eyes of its western 
counterparts -- would be jeopardized if it does not discontinue 
every form of cooperation on advanced technology with Brazil 
should the Brazilian Senate fail to ratify two treaties: One 
containing amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty (which bans 
nuclear weapons in Latin America and establishes controls) and a 
quadripartite agreement signed by Brazil, Argentina, the 
(Vienna-based) International Atomic Energy Agency, and by the 
recently created joint Brazilian-Argentine agency (which 
establishes comprehensive inspections and controls on nuclear 
activities by the two countries, which are described as "full 
scope safeguards." [given in English] 
  German laws require, irrespective of which party is in the 
government at the end of this year (general elections are 
scheduled for 16 October), that the Brazilian-German nuclear 
agreement signed in June 1976 be renounced. Through this 
agreement, Brazil gained access to various stages of the nuclear 
fuel cycle, in addition to obtaining technological transfer and 
to reaching a commitment to build two large nuclear reactors 
(Angra-2 and Angra-3). The German Government cannot cooperate 
with a country which is not a signatory of the Non-proliferation 
Treaty (NPT) -- which is the case of Brazil -- or which has not 
agreed to another international control regime. Unless it is 
rescinded by either of the two parties, the agreement will be 
automatically renewed at the end of 1994 for another five years. 
  To maintain its credibility, the German Government is 
prepared to go as far as shouldering the financial consequences 
of reneging the contracts to build the Angra-2 plant, which is 
guaranteed by the Hermes insurance company (that is, German 
taxpayers may lose hundreds of millions of marks). 
  There is adequate parliamentary support for the government 
to 
take such a decisive course of action. An influential group of 
Social Democratic deputies has been campaigning since last year 
to get the nuclear agreement renounced on the grounds that 
Brazil has failed to join the NPT and that it refuses to submit 
its activities to international inspection. Most conservative 
deputies of the ruling German party (the Christian Democratic 
Union) firmly believe that "if the price to pay to secure a 
permanent seat for Germany on the UN Security Council is to 
support irresponsible countries like Brazil or Nigeria, it would 
be a very high price to pay," as a leading spokesman for the 
Christian Democratic bloc recently put it to a ranking Brazilian 
counterpart in Bonn. 
  The German reaction to the Brazilian Senate's behavior has 
been unanimously conveyed by several German circles, the private 
sector included. "Brazil will not receive a single screw from 
Germany if the Senate fails to ratify these treaties," is a 
widely repeated phrase. The campaign on the nuclear issue has 
already had an impact on other sectors: A visit to Germany 
scheduled for February by a Brazilian delegation has been 
canceled without clear explanations. This delegation was to have 
studied the impact of Brazil's proclaimed decision to join the 
Missile Technology Control Regime (its English acronym is MTCR) 
on Brazilian-German space exploration projects, which is being 
partially implemented by a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz. 
According to a high-placed source in Bonn, Siemens executives 
have also voiced concern about the fact that the Brazilian 
Senate is provoking a situation which in practice will preclude 
any advanced technology transfer to Brazil. 
  Brazil is on the "H list" (from which Argentina has just 
been 
excluded), which forces any German exporter or supplier of 
sensitive technology item to Brazil to obtain special 
authorizations before concluding any deal. It has been stated 
in Bonn that if the Senate fails to accept international 
controls on Brazilian nuclear programs, the above requirement 
would also be applied to projects such as the transfer of 
technology for building conventional submarines. Yet, if the 
Senate ratifies these agreements, the German Government would be 
willing to consider building a nuclear powered submarine -- a 
major project of the Brazilian Navy -- as "a borderline case" 
not explicitly banned by the Tlatelolco Treaty or by the 
quadripartite treaty. This project may thus be continued. 
  There has been wide speculation and conjectures in Bonn 
about 
the existence of "skeletons in the closets" of the military; 
that is, about whether international inspection teams may yet 
find undisclosed atomic projects in Brazil. The German 
Government speculates as to whether the reasons behind 
non-ratification is prompted by the Brazilian Senate's failure 
to understand that this is a far-reaching subject that it has 
many implications, or whether there are "other motives" for its 
reluctance to agree to the international inspections. In 
official and unofficial remarks, German officials have noted, 
however, that they have no indication to conclude that Brazil is 
running undisclosed parallel atomic programs. 
  The German Government is both perplexed and scared by 
Brazil. 
It has been openly contended here that a few powerful people 
are hurting the interests of the Brazilian nation in the name of 
"things of the past and of outdated positions," an argument that 
is often used to refer to the Brazilian Senate. Officially, the 
German Government is not supporting any country in the 
reorganization and (expansion) process of the UN Security 
Council. Informally, however, it is known that Bonn would 
support Brazil at the United Nations. Yet, this will 
fundamentally depend now on the nuclear issue. 
  German perplexity does not stem from the behavior of the 
legislature -- which is marred by corruption scandals -- alone 
but also from that of the executive branch. In Bonn, no one 
knows for sure whether the construction of Angra-2 will be 
completed. Wishing to conclude the project, the Germans have 
expressed desire to supply additional credit and even to finance 
Brazilian counterpart funds (nearly $750 million), arguing that 
it would be cheaper to complete the 1,300 megawatt plant now 
than to cancel the entire project. It is not known, however, 
what President Itamar Franco will decide. In 1978, Franco 
presided in the Senate a congressional investigating committee 
on the Brazilian-German nuclear agreement. 
  Another problem that scares many people in Germany is the 
fact that Brazil is having difficulties in obtaining agreement 
with the IMF, a condition for reaching an agreement with the 
Paris Club, which encompasses all of Brazilian governmental 
creditors. Germany is the main trade partner of Brazil within 
the European Union and it is the second leading investor of risk 
capital in Brazil, second only to the United States. The German 
Government is thus concerned about the constitutional revision 
because it believes foreign investors in Brazil are treated 
differently from or worse than domestic investors. 
  It has been noted in Bonn that German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel touched on all these topics during his visit to Brasilia 
in October. The Brazilian foreign minister's visit, which seeks 
to strengthen German-Brazilian relations, which was described as 
strategic for both countries (during the Geisel administration) 
could be seriously undermined if the Senate does not change its 
position. It is feared that Amorim may come to Bonn only to 
hear complaints, without being able to give any kind of 
explanation.

<F P=106> [(Sergey Viktorov) commentary] </F>
  [Text] Iran has once again stressed the peaceful nature of 
its nuclear program. [Word indistinct] Reza Amrollahi, official 
representative of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization [IAEO], 
speaking to an IRNA correspondent on Wednesday, said that a 
recent report in the U.S. magazine "U.S. [word indistinct] 
TODAY" is sheer lies and (?part of a) U.S. plot against the 
world of Islam. (Sergey Viktorov) writes on this: 
  We should recall that normally information by the special 
services of the United States form the basis of reports such as 
those that are being (?recently heard) in a number of Western 
countries. Taking into consideration the special 
characteristics of U.S.-Iranian relations, it is difficult to 
consider such information to be realistic and unbiased. 
  Nevertheless, according to known facts, in their effort to 
portray the Islamic Republic as a country that has been 
(?rejected) by world society, the U.S. special services are 
willing to ignore conclusions that have been drawn by impartial 
international experts, something which Reza Amrollahi justly 
pointed out in his news conference. 
  Last fall a group of experts from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] inspected all the nuclear installations on 
Iranian territory and did not find any proof that Iran is 
manufacturing nuclear weapons. It should be noted that all 
similar IAEA inspections have so far yielded the same 
conclusion. Moreover, it should be added that Tehran has never 
expressed its intention to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Pact and has also signed the agreement on (?banning) chemical 
weapons. 
  Thus it appeared that the exploitation of this issue could 
be 
stopped. But this did not happen. The United States has 
succeeded in its efforts to convince its partners in the G-7 to 
join in boycotting the exports to Iran of so-called technology 
that can be used for dual purposes. Tehran, which was in a 
technologically unfavorable position, requested assistance from 
Russia and China to complete the construction of incomplete 
nuclear energy installations, and specifically (?agreed) on the 
purchase of two Russian-built nuclear reactors and one Chinese 
nuclear reactor. However, this rekindled a more intense campaign 
in the West regarding Iran's ambitious nuclear programs. 
Russia's assurances were in vain. Russia pointed out that 
Russian-Iranian cooperation in the field of nuclear energy would 
be strictly within the framework of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Pact and under the constant supervision of the IAEA. 
  Of course, the United States wants a more moderate 
government 
to come to power in Tehran. However, the traditional anti-U.S. 
remarks by the current Iranian leaders do not leave any chance 
for a positive change in the situation, and it seems that the 
West will thus continue to exploit the issue of Iran's imaginary 
nuclear threat. 
  One can agree with Reza Amrollahi's remarks in his recent 
interview. However, Tehran's wish to (?link) itself with the 
world of Islam, which can recently be seen, is also reflected in 
these remarks. If one can [word indistinct] speak about a type 
of U.S. plot, it is highly possible that this plot is only 
against Iran. But this plot must be regarded as a confrontation 
between two irreconcilable ideologies.

  [Text] A seminar attended by experts from the French 
Institute of Protection and Nuclear Security is being held in 
Kiev. Experience of this country, where 78 percent of the 
electricity is generated at atomic power stations, is of great 
practical importance for us. According to the Center for 
Nuclear and Radiation Safety at the Ukrainian State Atomic 
Supervision Administration [Goskomnadzor], this seminar designed 
for nuclear experts has initiated implementation of a three-year 
project providing technical assistance to Ukraine in this 
sphere. The project is financed by the European Community 
Commission as part of the TACIS [expansion unknown] program.

  [Text] Moscow, Feb. 2 [dateline as received] (YONHAP) -- 
The Russian Government hopes to expand military cooperation with 
South Korea as it would contribute to peace and stability in the 
Asia and Pacific region, Vice Defense Minister Andrei Kokoshin 
says. 
  In an exclusive interview with YONHAP News Agency, Kokoshin 
said Wednesday that Russia positively evaluates its cooperation 
in the military field with South Korea. 
  The prospects for further expansion of such cooperation are 
bright, he said. 
  The development of military cooperation between the two 
countries will not have an adverse effect on any third country 
but rather contribute to the easing of tensions in the 
Asia-Pacific region, he noted. 
  Kokoshin, who is in charge of Russia's defense industry, 
said 
that conditions are ripe for South Korean companies to take part 
in the process of privatizing Russia's arms industry. 
  Russia needs South Korean capital for joint development of 
its arms industry as well as Korea's expertise in marketing. 
  He said the Russian Government is prepared to supply 
up-to-date military hardware to South Korea to help repay loans 
the former Soviet Union had taken out from Seoul. Moscow has 
already made a proposal and is now awaiting the Seoul 
government's reply, he added. 
  He also said there was no room for doubt about President 
Boris Yeltsin's promise that Russia would not provide North 
Korea with offensive weapons, a pledge Moscow would continue to 
honor. 
  With regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, Kokoshin said 
the Russian Government's basic policy is that Pyongyang should 
not have any nuclear weapons and therefore, Moscow will do its 
utmost to achieve that goal. 
  In any event, Russia believes that the level of North 
Korea's 
nuclear development isn't very high, he added.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is looking 
for various ways on getting repaid for loans to the former 
Soviet Union, including material repayment in enriched uranium 
and bunker C oil, an envoy said Tuesday. 
  "Possibility is not that high at this moment," said Kim 
Sok-kyu, South Korean Ambassador to Moscow, "but we are studying 
these ideas because of the precedent of being repaid in 
aluminum." 
  Kim temporarily returned to Seoul last week to brief the 
government on recent developments in Russia and to coordinate 
Seoul's policy toward Moscow. 
  The Paris Club will provide a rough guideline on repayment 
schedule for South Korea, Kim told a press conference, and an 
inter- ministerial discussion with Finance and Trade, Industry 
and Resources Ministries will find various alternatives. 
  Seoul promised 3 billion U.S. dollars in financial aid to 
the 
former communist country but delivered only 1.47 billion dollars 
and suspended the rest at the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
  Seoul has received a list of arms Russia offered for joint 
development and production, another alternative to loan 
repayment, but the government will need prudent review before 
making any decision, said Kim. 
  On North Korea-Russia relations, the envoy said Moscow 
proposed vice minister-level talks to North Korea from this year 
but is yet to receive a reply. 
  "North Korea and Russia are gradually restoring their 
relations of dialogue," he told reporters. 
  Moscow has not abandoned human rights issue with Pyongyang 
and is determined to insert the rights clause for the workers in 
a new agreement on operating North Korean lumber yard, he said. 
  President Boris Yeltsin said he wants his South Korean 
counterpart Kim Yong-sam to make certain to visit Russia this 
year, and the two countries will consult on this issue, he said.

  [Text] Moscow January 22 TASS -- The Russian Foreign 
Ministry has denied allegations that Russia has offered to pay 
its debts to South Korea by selling or launching joint 
production of modern arms. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS, Nikolay Solovyov, 
head of the Second Department for Asia of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, on Saturday, said that "the Russian Foreign Ministry 
did not hand over to the Embassy of South Korea on January 19 
any official documents concerning the selling or joint 
production of missiles, submarines or other modern technologies 
as a form of debt payment for credits." 
  The statement followed a publication by the South Korean 
newspaper HANGUK ILBO which quoted sources in the South Korean 
Foreign Ministry as saying that Russia had officially offered to 
pay its debts for Korean credits either by selling its arms or 
launching their joint production. The newspaper also claimed 
that on January 19 the South Korean Embassy in Moscow had been 
presented with a list of military technologies offered by Russia 
for selling or joint production. It said the list had to be 
considered by the Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs and 
Defence. 
  The newspaper said that during his visit to Seoul in August 
1993 Aleksandr Shokhin, who was a Russian vice-prime minister at 
that time, handed over to South Korea a package of proposals on 
military and technical cooperation. Solovyov confirmed this 
information, but added that South Korea has not made an official 
reply yet.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A New Nuclear Joke"] </F>
  [Text] During bilateral talks between the two countries in 
Tokyo Monday, India and Japan agreed to work together to bring 
about a non-discriminatory Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. It 
is not yet clear as to which country initiated the proposal but 
it is an even bet that it must have come from our nearest 
neighbours across the Wagah border. Pakistan's stand has always 
been for a regional NPT but what India is now proposing along 
with Japan is an NPT on a world basis. This is, the effect 
India's declaration that if all other countries dismantle their 
nuclear facilities, only then will India agree to do so. As far 
as India is concerned, the present treaty, which expires in 
1995, has been extremely non- discriminatory in its own behalf. 
After the demise of the Soviet Union as a superpower, the USA 
remains the only superpower in the world which is in a position 
to dictate what the nuclear programme of any country should be. 
In this respect all its dictation has been directed at Pakistan 
which has been asked to cap its programme and then roll it back 
so that this country goes back to square one in the nuclear 
field, despite its repeated protestations that it intends to use 
nuclear power only for peaceful purposes. We have even agreed 
to sign the NPT if India does so at the same time. India's 
response, on the other hand, has been persistently negative. It 
is far ahead of Pakistan, having exploded a nuclear device as 
early as 1974 and the world knows this. This, apparently is not 
where India intends to stop if its latest proposal is examined 
closely. 
  Obviously, India sees no threat to its existence from the 
USA. It lives in mortal terror of its Chinese neighbours and 
trusts Pakistan not one whit and, it repeatedly warns its people 
that an attack from this country can never be ruled out. These 
are the two basic reasons for the present ploy. It stands out 
like a sore thumb that India is endeavouring for an NPT on a 
global basis in order to buy time to stockpile nuclear arms. 
The Indian proposal has been made with a lot of check since the 
attitude of the US towards its nuclear programme is nothing 
short of an endorsement of whatever India has achieved in that 
field, which is reported to be more than considerable. The 
Indian dread of the Chinese defies comprehension. The late Field 
Marshal Ayub Khan was once asked if he thought China might 
attack India. He pooh poohed the idea with the remark, "why 
should China do that and end up having to feed India's millions 
when it is hardly in a position to feed its own?" As for 
Pakistan, the idea is similarly ludicrous. The bania 
[derogatory term for petty traders] is a crafty creature by 
nature who thrives on intrigue. The latest Indo-Japanese 
proposal needs to be shot down in favour of one that calls for 
complete annihilation of nuclear arsenal the world over in one 
fell swoop. In that case there would be no need for an NPT at 
all. The world cannot afford to give India enough time to 
become a nuclear power.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 17 KYODO -- Japan urged India to join 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) to sweep away 
international concern about its development of nuclear weapons, 
Foreign Ministry officials said Monday [17 January]. 
  Japan made the call during bilateral talks in Tokyo on 
nuclear nonproliferation, the second of their kind between the 
two nations, the officials said. 
  Japan is greatly concerned about India's nuclear development 
problem in view of its guidelines on implementing official 
development assistance (ODA), they said. 
  The guidelines require Japan to take into account, when 
extending ODA, the recipient nation's military expenditure and 
development, production, import and export of weapons, missiles 
and mass- destruction weapons. 
  Japan also called on India to accept inspections of certain 
nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) to improve the transparency of its nuclear development 
plans, the officials said. 
  The Indian delegation, pointing out that India's basic 
policy 
is the total abolition of nuclear weapons worldwide, called on 
nuclear power nations to make commitments to abolish nuclear 
weapons by presenting specific schedules, they said. 
  India also told Japan it basically supports the nuclear test 
ban treaty and a treaty to ban production of fissionable 
materials, they said. 
  India will be able to meet Japan's demand to improve 
transparency of its nuclear plans if the treaty to ban 
production of fissionable materials takes effect, the Indian 
delegation was quoted as saying. 
  Also in the talks, Japan pointed out the importance of 
holding multilateral talks to discuss security in Southwest 
Asia, including nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and missiles. 
  India told Japan that if such talks are held, it is 
necessary 
to invite all nations that could influence security in Southwest 
Asia and ensure that all nations shoulder equal obligations, the 
officials said. 
  Touching on India's relations with Pakistan, the Indian 
delegation explained that the ties are still tense despite talks 
between vice foreign ministers of both countries, they said. 
  Japan and India held their first bilateral meeting on 
nuclear 
nonproliferation last March in Delhi. 
  The Japanese and Indian delegations agreed to hold a third 
round of talks this year, the officials said.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Jan (MENA) -- An official in the Supreme 
State Security Prosecution has stated that the security agencies 
succeeded in capturing a number of automatic rifles and 
explosives in an arms cache in the Hulwan district on 
information provided by terrorist Muhammad Ahmad Farhan, who was 
arrested during the al-Ma'sarah incidents last week. 
  The captured material was sent to the criminology laboratory 
for examination and to prepare a report on its condition and 
date of manufacture. 
  The prosecution ordered the cache sealed after a thorough 
search by the security agencies. 
  Meanwhile, the Supreme State Security Court continues its 
interrogation of Farhan in the Qasr al-'Ayni hospital for the 
sixth consecutive day.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Excerpt] Mubarak denounces the terrorists, noting that the 
Egyptian people have rejected their motives, which are contrary 
to Islam. He adds that the security of the country is the 
responsibility of each person. He adds: "The police behavior 
toward the enemies of the homeland will remain civilized and 
governed by the rule of law and will remain above the methods of 
revenge. The police will not punish anyone for a crime 
committed by someone else but will put the whole matter into the 
hands of a fair and honest judiciary that is not subject to any 
authority other than conscience and the law." Mubarak notes that 
the terrorist incidents could have been used as an excuse to 
impose "emergency measures" but that Egypt's government has 
insisted on adhering to the rule of law due to its belief in 
democracy. 
  President Mubarak continues his speech by noting: "The fact 
is that some of our national parties have taken a step in the 
right direction. They condemn terrorism and strongly call for 
eliminating its lairs, causes, and roots. Only some of the 
enemies of democracy, who are still hiding behind false slogans 
that propagate terrorist ideas and actions, have remained 
outside this national consensus." He recalls his recent call 
for a national dialogue among political parties and clarifies 
that he is not trying to eliminate the differences among 
political parties but rather to find a consensus on confronting 
terrorism.

  [Text] Cairo, Jan 29 (AFP) -- A party of senior Egyptian 
Interior Ministry officials has gone to Yemen to try to counter 
the influx of Islamic fundamentalist guerrillas from 
Afghanistan, the semi-official daily AL-AHRAM reported on 
Saturday. 
  The paper said the delegation wanted to "stop the 
fundamentalists coming from Afghanistan from reaching Cairo 
through Yemen" to carry out attacks. 
  The paper said the delegation was "carrying documents with 
the addresses of the homes of fundamentalists" implicated in 
recent attacks in Cairo. 
  The report said Islamic militants arrested in Egypt, 
including the alleged perpetrators of an abortive attempt to 
assassinate Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi in November in 
Cairo, had supplied police with these addresses. 
  They also provided information about camps located in Yemen 
where they received training in weapons handling and explosives. 
  The visit to Sanaa follows a recent meeting in Tunis between 
the Egyptian and Yemeni interior ministers, Hasan al-Alfi and 
Muhammad Salim al-Mutawakkil. 
  Al-Mutawakkil told AL-AHRAM then that they had discussed the 
possibility of signing an extradition treaty to enable Egypt to 
recover fundamentalists who had fled to Yemen. 
  He said Yemen had "set up lines of coordination with Egypt 
in 
the fight against terrorism."

  [Text] Islamabad, Jan 23 -- The government will expel all 
illegal immigrants from Pakistan and will not accept any 
pressure in this regard. 
  Minister for Interior Maj-Gen (red) Nasirullah Khan Babar 
told the National Assembly on Sunday that the government has 
decided to remove all illegal immigrants who were allegedly 
engaged in terrorist activities. 
  "We will not allow anyone to use our soil for carrying out 
terrorist activities against any country," he maintained. 
  Mr Mehmood Khan Achakzai had raised the issue in the House 
and demanded of the government to remove all illegal immigrants. 
  He was of the view that their (immigrants) activities were 
creating tremendous problems for Pakistan. 
  Maulana Fazlur Rahman, Secretary-General of JUI(F) 
[Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam], however defended them and said today 
those who were being branded as terrorists were once declared 
freedom fighters. 
  He said that the government was taking action against Arab 
dissidents on the pressure of the U.S. and demanded not to take 
any action against them. 
  But the Minister for Interior said there was no question of 
being lenient on the question. In this regard, he particularly 
mentioned Egypt and said Cairo was Pakistan's very good friend 
and it has raised the issue of Egyptian dissidents who were 
operating from Pakistan against Husni Mubarak's government. 
  "Our government believes that these illegal immigrants are 
undesirable elements who could not be allowed to live on our 
soil," the Minister said. 
  He said Afghan Jihad was over and nobody would now be 
allowed 
to live in Pakistan without having legal documents. "These 
people should go to Afghanistan as we will not be offering them 
any refuge." 
  He further said hundreds of illegal outsiders have already 
been removed from the country and others would soon be expelled.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hasan al-Turaybi, general secretary of the </F>
Arab-Islamic People's Conference, by Pierre Darcourt in 
Khartoum; date not given -- first two paragraphs are LE FIGARO 
introduction] 
  [Text] The Manshiyah district of Khartoum, in the eastern 
part of the Sudanese capital. A sober building bedecked with 
bright red bougainvilleas. This is the home of Shaykh Hasan 
al-Turaybi, general secretary of the Arab Islamic People's 
Conference. The man the Western chancelleries, Egypt, and Saudi 
Arabia accuse of "leading a veritable Islamic International from 
the Middle East to the Maghreb," led us into a drawing room with 
walls covered with verses from the Koran. His slender figure 
was wrapped in a wide white galabiyah, his bronzed face framed 
with a neatly trimmed gray beard, his head covered with a silky 
turban, his smile was dazzling and his eyes sparkling with 
intelligence. 
  During three hours of conversation, this linguist who is 
regarded as an authority among well-read people in the Muslim 
world, spoke in excellent French interspersed with unexpected 
signs of humor. It is difficult to imagine that this affable, 
erudite person, holder of a masters' degree from Oxford 
University and a doctorate in law from the Sorbonne [Paris 
university], should be regarded as one of the most dangerous men 
in the world, the leader of a "new empire of Evil" in 
Washington's eyes. 
  [Darcourt] Who are you, Shaykh al-Turaybi? 
  [Al-Turaybi] It is for you to choose. For my enemies I am 
the "green devil," the "guru" of Islamic extremism. For my 
friends, I am Shaykh al-Turaybi, a title which the Sudanese 
confer on a man of age and knowledge, a man of religion. To 
understand better who I am, I must talk about my background. I 
was born on 1 February 1932 in Kassala in northeast Sudan, a 
village close to the Ethiopian border, by a whim of the 
itinerant career of my father, who for 30 years had the job of 
qadi, or Muslim judge. My father had graduated from the faculty 
of religious sciences in Omdurman, which explains my attraction 
to Koranic and legal studies. 
  Our family is descended from a famous line of religious 
dignitaries. My ancestor Daf'allah, a renowned sufi, created a 
Koranic school in the center of the country, frequented by many 
disciples, and founded the village of Turaybi which has born his 
name for 300 years. My wife Wisal al-Madi is the direct 
descendant of Muhammad Ahmad, the Great Madi, who swept the 
British troops from Khartoum in 1885. It was during those 
terrible assaults that Gordon, British governor-general of 
Sudan, was killed. The Madi had called on his faithful, the 
al-Ansar, to fight against "the foreign infidels and the impious 
Turks" to establish in Sudan the kingdom of God based on the 
precepts of the Koran. The first Sudanese nationalism was born 
with him. 
  [Darcourt] You studied abroad for seven years. Which 
impressed you most, Britain or France? 
  [Al-Turaybi] France, without any doubt. I spent two years 
in Britain. Long enough to complete a master's degree and no 
more. And I continued my studies in Paris. At that time, going 
to France was already an act of independence in opposition to 
the British colonialists. The whole Sudanese elite was then 
focused on London. English was still the official state 
language. I stayed in France from 1959 to 1964. My wife was 
with me and speaks excellent French. We have six children and 
our first son was born in Paris. During my stay, I was struck 
by the courtesy of the teachers and the comradeship of the 
students. There was no segregation. I was excited by the 
richness and precision of the French language, the culture, the 
history of the Revolution, the relations between Church and 
state, and the study of the different Constitutions. I was not 
focused exclusively on my law studies. I went to the National 
Library, I visited museums. During the university vacations, I 
went to Strasbourg, Toulouse, and Albi, to Germany, and Italy. 
I think that the world is like a book of which you have only 
read the first page until you have left your own country. 
  [Darcourt] How did you enter politics? 
  [Al-Turaybi] My first public engagement was to launch a 
campaign for the emancipation of Sudanese women and to give them 
the right to vote. I thought that they should play a full part 
in building a new Islamic society, well-anchored in this 
century. They also needed to be taken from the exclusive 
confinement of domestic tasks. It was a difficult enterprise, 
but those reforms succeeded. 
  [Darcourt] You are the founder of the Arab-Islamic People's 
Conference, which holds its congress in Khartoum each year. Are 
you satisfied with its work? 
  [Al-Turaybi] The scale of this meeting is a unique event in 
history. More than 500 delegates representing 56 countries from 
four continents -- Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America -- 
took part in it. Nobody was excluded. Among the delegates were 
around 20 leaders of the Sunni clergy; muftis from Bosnia, 
Greece, and Albania; the rector of the Grand Mosque in Paris; 
German imams; several mullahs; imams from the United States, and 
others -- Belgians, Spanish, French -- many women; and even 12 
American bishops in the framework of the Church-Islam dialogue 
which we launched last year. This conference primarily aimed to 
mobilize the largest number of groups and prominent individuals 
to reconcile the Muslims divided among the four corners of the 
world and unite them in the face of those who are relentlessly 
hostile to them. Consensus was reached on a firm will: To 
raise the idea of God in the face of American society in which 
the supremacy of commercial materialism backed by an 
overwhelming military power leaves room for no faith in divine 
law. 
  [Darcourt] During the conference, the United States was 
clearly named as "Islam's mortal enemy..." 
  [Al-Turaybi] The arrogance of the United States which has 
become the only world superpower offends us. It subjects 
countries which refuse to bow to its diktats to a harsh economic 
blockade. This is true of Sudan, which is deprived of all 
development aid, and blacklisted for "violation of human rights 
and collaboration with terrorist organizations." 
  [Darcourt] This is also true of Libya... 
  [Al-Turaybi] The situation is different. Nobody is accusing 
us of having blown up airplanes and we respect the embargo. 
Colonel al-Qadhdhafi has been in power for a quarter of a 
century. He started his national socialist revolution inspired 
by al-Nasir, then he launched his revolution of the Little Green 
Book. He apparently no longer believes in it. His current 
preoccupation is to unite the tribes. But the Americans are 
stepping up the pressure on his entourage and will continue to 
stifle Libya. This is only a remark, but al-Qadhdhafi is likely 
to end up in the next cell to General Noriega, the former 
dictator of Panama. 
  [Darcourt] Sudan is regarded as one of the hubs of 
international terrorism... 
  [Al-Turaybi] These accusations are unfounded. Sudan, 
devastated by a civil war which has been going on for 10 years 
and which is costing it $1 million per day, does not have the 
money or material resources to maintain guerrillas abroad in 
Egypt or Algeria. On the other hand, where American interests 
lie, attacks on democracy are never condemned. Take the example 
of Saudi Arabia: It is a country without a Constitution in which 
nobody votes, governed for more than 60 years by an absolute 
monarchy, the king and...3,500 princes of the blood covered with 
dollars. For the Americans, Saudi Arabia, the main holder of 
the world's crude oil reserves, is an untouchable preserve. 
  [Darcourt] France was not attacked once during the 
Conference... 
  [Al-Turaybi] We have no complexes about France. It did not 
colonize Sudan. France has major assets for becoming the 
preferred interlocutor of the Muslim peoples once again -- its 
feeling for law, its influence in Africa, its knowledge of the 
Arab world, and its advanced technology. We are happy that our 
government chose Air France, and not British Airways, to serve 
Khartoum; Paris, and not London, as the main stop; and that 
Sudan Airways, our national company, bought Airbus planes and 
not Boeings. 
  [Darcourt] Among the delegations invited to the Conference 
were several members of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], of 
whom Abdallah Hannas was the spokesman. The FIS's armed groups 
are stepping up summary executions of foreigners on Algerian 
territory... 
  [Al-Turaybi] This conflict is starting in the same way as 
the FLN's [National Liberation Front] Algerian war, by 
assassinations, outbreaks of violence, and very harsh police 
repression. Every time I met a member of the FIS I always said 
to him: "Have you spoken with France?" He replied: "Out of the 
question." I insisted: "You must talk, open a dialogue. Your 
country is in danger of breaking up. If you come to power by 
force, 3 million or even 4 million Algerians will probably flee 
like boat people to the French coast." 
  France, already disturbed by the problem of immigrants, will 
not be able to receive them. This chaos must be avoided, a 
compromise must be found, and an agreement reached. For the 
time being, you see, these armed groups are not controlled, the 
FIS is a passionate movement without a precise program and not 
yet structured. The first line is harsh. The second line is 
intelligent. After two years of discussion, I have been able to 
persuade them to talk with France and the FLN. Serious contacts 
have taken place in Germany, in the United States, and in Sudan. 
The civil war is a bad fever which must be brought down at all 
costs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Rukh Believes That a Campaign of </F>
Political Terrorism Is Being Waged Against It"] 
  [Text] On 20 January, the chairman of the Ukraine People's 
Rukh [Movement for Perestroyka] held a news conference during 
which he read the statement, adopted the day before by the Rukh 
central leadership on the terror campaign against Rukh, its 
leaders, and activists. The Rukh believes that the acts of 
terror against it are due to its political line aimed at the 
building of an independent democratic state and at ridding 
Ukraine of the former communist nomenclatura. 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil quoted a number of facts: Several 
attacks, over the recent weeks, on the electoral headquarters of 
the Rukh Chernivtsi regional organization; a pogrom on Christmas 
night in the building of the Ternopil Rukh organization; the 
beating up of children of several leaders of rayon Rukh 
organizations in Odessa Oblast. Unknown people broke into the 
apartment of the chairman of the Kirovohrad organization, and on 
15 January, there was an attempt to break into the apartment of 
Les Tanyuk, member of the central Rukh leadership and member of 
Ukraine's Supreme Council Presidium. On 17 January, in broad 
daylight, Colonel Serhiy Budko was beaten up in Vinnytsya. 
Finally, there is the attack on the Rukh secretariat in Kiev 
and the disappearance of the head of the secretariat Mykhaylo 
Boychyshyn, of whom nothing is known to this day. 
  The Rukh demands that the president and the Supreme Council 
chairman intervene in the situation and that Ukraine's Security 
Service, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Procurator 
General's Office investigate the criminal actions against Rukh 
activists.

<F P=106> ["stui"-signed report: "Loeschnak: Right-Wing Extremist </F>
Background to Letter Bombs Unpleasant for Haider"] 
  [Excerpt] Vienna -- Two of the four suspects in the letter 
bomb affair who are still in prison "were involved in the 
attacks in one way or another," Interior Minister Franz 
Loeschnak stated on Sunday [23 January] during the "Meet the 
Press" program. Loeschnak hopes that the judiciary will be able 
to present an "intermediate result" for the bill of indictment 
by the end of the month. The interior minister considers it a 
proven fact that the attacks were carried out by "perpetrators 
completely familiar with the right-wing scene in Austria, and 
clearly xenophobic." 
  He believes that the suggestion by Joerg Haider, chairman of 
the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], that by investigating the 
right-wing scene the authorities were following a "dead-end 
road," can only be explained by the fact that this is 
"unpleasant" for Haider. After all, Horst Jakob Rosenkranz, the 
husband of Lower Austrian FPOe deputy Barbara Rosenkranz, "was 
clearly recognizable" together with one of the suspects on a 
video. 
  This statement led to furious protests among the FPOe. 
Haider described Loeschnak's attacks as "unjustified." He 
stresed that, together with the ORF, Loeschnak is attempting to 
disparage the whole FPOe. 
  Loeschnak admitted that government forces were "surprised" 
at 
the strength of the right-wing extremist scene. [passage

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Gottfried Kuessel, the "leader </F>
of Austrian right-wing extremists," by Otto Tuma in the Stein 
Prison in Krems; date not given: "The Voice of the Leader"] 
  [Text] The politicians will be dragged out of Parliament 
by a frenzied mass of people and be hanged on lampposts along 
Vienna's Ringstrasse street. This retribution will be terrible, 
the inflammatory speaker in his olive-green "leisure suit" said 
to his circle of crypto-Teutons in front of a blazing bonfire, 
calling for "different" times. 
  The "terrible visionary," neo-Nazi leader Gottfried Kuessel, 
35, who has been imprisoned since 7 January 1992, was sentenced 
to the minimum term of 10 years imprisonment for neo-Nazi 
activities. The state prosecutor has now appealed against the 
verdict and called for a more severe sentence. In view of the 
letter bomb attacks -- friends of Kuessel were arrested after 
the series of attacks -- officers of the state police searched 
cell West E 27 in the high-security wing of the Krems/Stein 
prison, the current address of the neo-Nazi leader. More than 
500 letters were confiscated in the secret night-time action on 
the instructions of the state prosecutor. 
  This is the first interview Kuessel gave after the terrible 
series of bomb attacks. His lawyer, Dr. Otto Tuma, asked the 
would-be Teuton the questions on behalf of WIENER, making a 
verbatim record of Kuessel's answers. 
  WIENER emphasizes that we do not identify ourselves with the 
statements of Gottfried Kuessel in the following interview. 
  [Tuma] Mr. Kuessel, you are in the hospital wing of Stein 
prison. What is your health situation? 
  [Kuessel] The gall stones that grew while I have been in 
prison were not only not treated in the Vienna Landesgericht 
Prison, but completely wrongly diagnosed, which resulted in 
permanent bilious attacks since early 1993. As far as I can 
see, the problem has now been solved through an operation. 
  [Tuma] You have been imprisoned for two years. Describe one 
day in Stein prison. 
  [Kuessel] At the moment, I am in the high-security wing and 
do odd chores in the house. This means that between 0700 and 
1500 I work in the house. The time after work and before I go 
to bed is generally dedicated to study, to work on my files, and 
to reading, and writing letters. 
  [Tuma] What are you reading at the moment? 
  [Kuessel] Wisnewski/Landgreber/Sieker: The RAF [Red Army 
Faction] Phantom. Eibl-Eibesfeldt: Man, the Risky Being. The 
Baghavadgita, and computer books. 
  [Tuma] Are you still in contact with your friends, maybe 
through letters? Also with those in prison? 
  [Kuessel] At the moment, that is to say for about one month, 
my correspondence has been interrupted for dubious reasons. I 
hardly receive any mail. I assume that the letters are 
deliberately withheld from me by some authorities. Moreover, in 
a search of my cell, all my letters, which had to pass through 
the censors anyway, were confiscated for dubious reasons; all 
that happened despite the fact that my contact with friends and 
acquaintances is widely limited to private and philosophical 
questions. 
  [Tuma] You get regular letters from your friends in Germany. 
What are the contents of these letters? 
  [Kuessel] As I said, these letters are exclusively of a 
private or philosophical nature. 
  [Tuma] Which of your friends in Germany have not 
disappointed you, and which have? 
  [Kuessel] I did not expect anything special from any of my 
acquaintances and friends, which is why nobody could disappoint 
me. Since a central organization has been a dream that was 
mainly dreamt by the media, but also by the authorities, and is 
to be maintained at any cost and regardless of the truth, and 
is, thus, to be made a reality in public, I did not have to 
expect the least from anyone. 
  [Tuma] What was your first thought when you learned of the 
letter-bomb attacks? 
  [Kuessel] That now somebody is trying to work against the 
natural developments in the 1994 election year! 
  [Tuma] Do you personally see any connection between your 
arrest and the letter bombs? 
  [Kuessel] No, because I do not think that the people I know 
were able to carry out such attacks, and any protests would 
certainly have been held as early as in September or October 
1993. Apart from the immediate victims of the attacks, those who 
are affected are only national and politically "right" groups. 
This should have been obvious to anybody who ever studied the 
theory of the issue of individual terror. The Austrian 
population understands such attacks only to a very limited 
degree and certainly does not support them. Therefore, I think 
that the forces that are behind these letter bombs are 
interested in the defamation of the political opposition in 
Austria and want to act against political opponents even with 
the methods of a police state. The violent actions of the 
authorities against persons from right and national circles, and 
the request for even further-reaching legal possibilities, show 
clear parallels with the actions of the FRG authorities against 
the left in the seventies. People with courage should try and 
consistently think through the question of who benefits from 
that. 
  [Tuma] What would you personally tell Vienna's mayor, Helmut 
Zilk, who was severely injured by a letter bomb? 
  [Kuessel] Personal talks should remain personal, although 
the basic tenor is certainly that physical violence against 
political opponents, irrespective of where they come from and 
how they represent themselves, is unacceptable. 
  [Tuma] How would you describe your current role and position 
in your so-called community of people with the same convictions? 
  [Kuessel] I am a political prisoner -- nothing else! 
  [Tuma] What aspects, what political positions do you see in 
a different light now that you have been in prison for two years? 
  [Kuessel] The suppression of those who think different 
politically has been stepped up and we are further away than 
ever from implementing the principle, which stood at the 
beginning of the development toward political freedom, and was 
defined by Rousseau: "I shall fight against your opinion as 
severely as I can, but I shall also fight for your right to 
articulate it." 
  [Tuma] Did you make any mistakes? 
  [Kuessel] In retrospect one is always wiser. With what I 
know today, I would certainly have reacted differently to 
certain things. However, considering the situation in which I 
was at the time, I hardly ever had any choice to act differently 
from what I did. 
  [Tuma] What do you think of people such as Franz Radl junior 
and senior, Peter Binder, Alexander Wolfert, and Gerhard Endres? 
(those persons were arrested after the series of letter-bomb 
attacks last year -- the editors) 
  [Kuessel] I consider those whom I know to be 
politically-minded people who would not carry out acts of 
terrorism! Most of those whom you mentioned have been under 
public observation for some time and are aware of it. 
  On the other hand, they are all intelligent enough to know 
it. Thus, I think I can rule out that my friends had nothing to 
do with the letter bombs. 
  [Tuma] Who are the "most promising" brains in your movement? 
Are they Bela Althans, Christian Worch, or Arnulf Priem? 
(Althans, Worch, and Priem are among the leaders of the German 
neo-Nazi scene -- the editors) 
  [Kuessel] Since there was and, as far as I know, there is no 
"movement," I think it is a waste of time to think about this 
question. Apart from those who you mentioned, there are enough 
other intelligent, interesting personalities in Europe, the 
names of whom are well known and who can speak for themselves. 
  [Tuma] The Russian nationalists were the clear winners of 
the parliamentary election. Does this circumstance have any 
influence on your movement or similar movements? 
  [Kuessel] The developments in Russia are interesting from a 
geo-political point of view, and I think it is advisable not to 
isolate the Liberal Democratic Party in terms of foreign policy, 
but to take the desire of so many Russian voters into 
consideration and conduct talks with the representatives of this 
party for the prosperous development of all peoples on the basis 
of political and economic independence. 
  [Tuma] An indiscreet question -- after such a long time in 
prison, what is the relationship with your girlfriend like? 
  [Kuessel] You are right, this is an indiscreet question that 
I do not want to answer indiscreetly. What unites me and my 
fiancee is not a "relationship," or "affair," or "partnership," 
but love. This love has been strained by the unfortunate 
circumstances. Nevertheless, I trust in this love! 
  [Tuma] What are your plans for your life after prison? 
  [Kuessel] Considering the length of time, I cannot really 
speak of plans. Nevertheless, I am "using" the time behind bars 
to study, study, and study to prepare for any eventualities 
after my release. Many prisoners leave prison and are fully 
dependent on the state. 
  I am planning to take life into my own hands -- whenever, 
wherever, and under whatever circumstances!

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Help From the Television Bureau"] </F>
  [Text] Astonishment and excitement on Lerchenberg in 
Mainz. ZDF, one of the biggest European broadcasting stations, 
had concluded a cooperation agreement with the Iranian state 
television, IRIB, in 1991. Now the people in Mainz had to learn 
from French judicial circles that their partners are said to be 
involved in the state terrorism of the mullahs. 
  "We are shocked," said Petra Zilken from the ZDF department 
for international affairs, "we have to think thoroughly about 
further cooperation." 
  The serious accusation is made in a charge that was filed by 
the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in Paris and has been 
secret so far. The file sent to the Elysee Palace deals with 
the murder of former Iranian Prime Minister Shapur Bakhtiar. 
Three men killed the politician, who had escaped to French 
exile, by numerous knife thrusts on 6 August 1991. 
  Before the end of this year, the presumable perpetrators are 
to be brought to trial in Paris. 
  After several dozen assassination attempts in Europe, among 
them the assassination of exiled Iranians in the Berlin 
"Mykonos" restaurant, it has now become known for the first 
time: Iran regularly used its television correspondents to 
provide the logistics for the killers. According to the French 
investigators, in this way they organized papers, apartments, 
and cars. Their advantage: Because of their cooperation with 
big European television stations, they enjoy hospitality in many 
places and can move unhindered everywhere. 
  In the case of Bakhtiar's murder, the wirepuller was in the 
Rue de Liege 27: Massoud Hendi [spelling as published], 45, 
Paris bureau chief of the Persian television station, IRIB, and 
nephew of Ayatollah Khomeyni. Hendi procured the visas for the 
two Iranian agents who have to stand trial for Bakhtiar's 
murder. Hendi himself is also detained. 
  A document of the French prosecutors shows that the Iranian 
Ministry for Telecommunications, partner of ZDF and other 
television stations, is doing the preliminary work for the 
assassination commands. 
  The Swiss television station, SRG, which only concluded an 
agreement with the Iranians in November 1993, reacted 
immediately. "Until the accusations are clarified, our agreement 
will be suspended," said Oswald Sigg, spokesman of the SRG 
executive board. 
  Tehran's answer came promptly. Last Thursday, Rudolf 
Weiersmueller, Swiss ambassador to Iran, was called to the 
Foreign Ministry. He had to receive a sharp protest note from 
the mullahs -- a further leg in the controversy between 
Switzerland and Iran, which has been smoldering for some time. 
  The Alpine republic has an international arrest warrant for 
Mohsen Sharif Esfahani, 39, and Ahmad Taheri [spelling as 
published], 32. Together with others, they are said to have 
executed former UN diplomat Kazem Radjavi [spelling as 
published] in his Geneva exile in April 1990. 
  The wanted persons were imprisoned in France. In the event 
of their extradition, which had been demanded by Switzerland, 
Tehran threatened a "firework of bombs" toward French mediator 
Jean Charles Marchiani. With success: The presumable 
terrorists were permitted to leave unmolested for Iran. 
  The German Federal Government was also well out of it 
because, before their trip to France, the presumable murderers 
had travelled from Frankfurt to Aachen -- watched by German 
security authorities. 
  On 17 November 1992, the Swiss police briefed the Federal 
Office of Criminal Investigation: "Ahmed Taheri and Sharif 
Esfahani, who were arrested in Paris, are suspects in the 
RADJAVI [preceding word capitalized] murder case." 
  The French received the decisive tipoff for the arrest from 
their German colleagues.

  [Text] Urban guerrilla group, November 17, has claimed 
responsibility for the assassination against former National 
Bank of Greece governor Mikhail Vranopoulos, saying it had 
planned several attempts against his life over the last six 
months. 
  In a proclamation sent late yesterday to the private Sky 
television station, November 17 said it had decided to "execute" 
Vranopoulos as the second most culpable person -- after former 
prime minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis and before former 
National Economy Minister Stefanos Manos -- in the "criminal" 
sale of the Iraklis General Cement Company to an Italian-led 
consortium. 
  It said the attack on Vranopoulos should also serve as a 
warning to individuals in either the private or public sector 
involved in specific privatisations. 
  Former National Economy and Finance Minister Stefanos Manos 
is also named along with Mr Mitsotakis and Vranopoulos as 
responsible for `defrauding' the Greek people and the 
dissolution of the Greek cement industry. 
  The six-and-a-half page typed proclamation, stamped with the 
group's trademark red five-pointed star, was dated June 1993. 
This was preceded by three paragraphs explaining that the 
attack had been planned for June but that the group had been 
forced to call off that attempt as well as others in July and 
September. 
  Developments in the Iraklis case since June are analysed in 
an addendum dated December 1993. 
  Mr Vranopoulos was replaced as National Bank of Greece 
governor by the new socialist government election in October. 
His police protection was removed on September 6 after a review 
of his request for removal deemed he was no longer a potential 
target. 
  In a postscript, November 17 also claims responsibility for 
several terrorist attacks since last winter, including 
explosions at the Moskhato, Maroussi, Petroupoli and Peristeri 
tax offices, a bazooka assault on the Nea Filadhelfia and 
Kaminia tax officials' cars in Ilisia, Pangrati, Patissia, Ayia 
Paraskevi and Yalatsi. 
  The group warns senior tax officials it will strike against 
them without warning. 
  17N [as published] claims that the PASOK government is not 
interested in a thorough investigation into the Iraklis case, 
because, the proclamation alleges, Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou was given, before 1989, a villa on the island of 
Patmos as a "gift" from the owner of the Khalkis Cements 
company, Mr Kioseoglou, in order to avoid the kind of 
investigation the former owners of Iraklis had had. 17N 
concludes this has made Mr Papandreou a sort of "hostage" of Mr 
Mitsotakis.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ethiopian Hi-Jacker Surrenders in </F>
Rome"] 
  [Text] Rome, 24 Jan (ANSA) -- An Ethiopian fisherman handed 
himself over to Italian authorities early Monday morning, after 
hijacking an Ethiopian Airlines plane en route from Senegal to 
Mali and ordering the pilot to fly to Rome. 
  Ethiopian Airlines flight ET972, with 32 passengers and 11 
crew members on board, touched down at Rome's Ciampino airport 
at 0335 (0235 GMT), after which lone hijacker Getachelw Mulat, 
25, give himself up to police without offering any resistance. 
  Passengers and crew reported that the man entered the 
cockpit 
without anyone noticing and threatened the pilot with a 
10-centimetre blade, ordering him to fly straight to Rome. 
  "We had been in the air for 30 minutes when the captain told 
us that there was a hijacking going on," said Gertjan Storm, the 
Dutch ambassador to Senegal who was amongst passengers on the 
flight. "Half an hour later the captain, who like all the crew 
remained perfectly calm and professional, told us that we were 
heading for Rome. Everyone remained calm and the hostesses 
continued to do their job, handing out food and drink." 
  According to well-informed sources, Mulat told investigators 
at Ciampino's immigration police station that he was a former 
soldier who now fished for a living. He said that the hijacking 
was a political gesture but denied belonging to any political 
group. He put his actions down to a protest against "a 
dictatorship which has deprived us of our freedom," the sources 
said. 
  The hijacker was allowed to talk to Ethiopia's ambassador in 
Rome, Alem Balemah Mradis, who told journalists "he seemed 
desperate to me. He said he had been an officer in our armed 
forces but is currently unemployed. He also said that he did 
this for political reasons but that he does not belong to any 
political party. He wants political refugee status." 
  Rome aviation authorities granted permission for the 
Ethiopian Airlines craft to land when they were informed that 
the plane had fuel left for only 10 minutes in the air. 
  This is the second time that an Ethiopian Airlines craft has 
been forced to change its flight path and head for Rome: in 
August 1992, five men armed with two hand grenades hijacked a 
flight from Addis Ababa and demanded asylum after persuading the 
pilot to take them to Ciampino. The five were sentenced to four 
years and eight months in prison for hijacking and possession of 
weapons.

  [Text] An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing which was flying from 
Dakar, Senegal, with 32 passengers on board was hijacked and 
forced to land in Italy. The Boeing 757 passenger plane which 
was flying to Addis Ababa from Senegal via Bamako carrying 32 
passengers and 11 crew was hijacked yesterday evening. The 
plane's hijacker, Getachew Mulate, surrendered to Italian police 
after forcing the plane to land at Italy's Ciampino Airport. 
There were no casualties among the passengers or crew. The 
plane has left Italy for Addis Ababa, according to Ethiopian 
Airlines. 
  According to AFP in Rome, the 25-year-old Mulate, who 
hijacked the plane wielding a knife, has asked for political 
asylum in Italy.

  [Text] Rome, 24 Jan (AFP) -- A 25-year-old Ethiopian 
seeking political asylum in Italy hijacked a Boeing 747 minutes 
after it had taken off from the Senegalese capital of Dakar and 
surrendered in Rome Monday, police here said. 
  Getachew Mulat, 25, a native of the Ethiopian province of 
Gojan and a Coptic Christian, told authorities after he 
surrendered that he had been an Army officer under the regime of 
Mengistu Haile-Mariam and belonged to a rival clan of the ruling 
power in Addis Ababa. He accused the current regime of Zenawi 
Meli of being "a dictatorship that had stripped Ethiopians of 
their freedom." 
  Getachew hijacked the Ethiopian Airlines flight 972 heading 
from Dakar to Addis Ababa, with stops in Bamako and Niamey, 
shortly after it took off Saturday at 8:00 p.m. (2000 GMT) and 
ordered it flown to Rome. Witnesses on board said he was armed 
with a switchblade but never threatened any of the 32 passengers 
and was calm throughout the entire episode. He repeatedly 
insisted on being flown to Rome, where there is a large 
Ethiopian community, and said he would surrender on landing. 
True to his word, Getachew gave himself up shortly after the 
plane touched down at Ciampino Airport near Rome at 3:30 a.m. 
(0230 GMT). 
  Authorities said they allowed the aircraft to land as it 
only 
had enough fuel left for 10 more minutes of flying. Getachew 
was immediately taken in for questioning and was to be charged 
with hijacking. 
  Addis Alam, the Ethiopian ambassador in Rome who spoke with 
Getachew, described him as a desperate man. "He claimed to have 
committed this act for political reasons and not as a militant 
act for a specific organisation," Addis said. Authorities who 
questioned Getachew said he appeared to be very religious and 
wore a wooden cross around his neck. They said he also carried 
several Copt religious books in his suitcase. 
  Five Ethiopians, also seeking political asylum, hijacked an 
Ethiopian Airlines plane to Rome in August 1992. They were 
sentenced to four and a half years in prison. No one was hurt 
in the 1992 hijacking.

  [Text] Rome, 24 Jan (ANSA) -- The hijacker was taken to 
Rome's Regina Coeli prison later in the morning, and will be 
charged with attack on public transport services. 
  A search of Mulat's luggage produced a large wooden 
crucifix, 
religious material and a notebook containing verses copied from 
the Bible, as well as photographs of the man's family. The 
hijacker told investigators that he was a Copt and was of a very 
religious nature. 
  The 43 passengers and crew on board the Ethiopian Airlines 
Boeing 757 (not 747 as stated previously) will be flown to Addis 
Ababa on the same aircraft at around midnight (2300 GMT) Monday 
night.

  [Text] The Iraq-Turkey oil pipeline sustained heavy damage 
after PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] militants bombed it last 
night. The damage to the pipeline, which was sabotaged at a 
point near the town of Cizre in Sirnak district, is estimated to 
be 500 billion Turkish lira. BOTAS [Turkish Pipeline Company] 
has started work on repairing the pipeline. 
  [Begin off-screen correspondent recording] PKK militants who 
attacked two villages in Mardin Province on Saturday night 
massacred 20 citizens, eight of them children, using chemical 
gas. 
  The PKK members attacked Cizre in Sirnak district the next 
day but were repulsed. One police officer was martyred during 
the clash. After being defeated in Cizre, the PKK militants 
bombed the crude oil pipeline at around 0100 this morning. A 
highly explosive bomb was used in the attack in the Duzova area 
between Idil and Cizre. Cizre, which lies 6 km away, was shaken 
by the force of the explosion. Smoke rising from the burning 
crude oil covered the Cudi Mountain and most of Cizre district. 
The fire was put under control when the valves were shut. The 
equivalent of 50,000 barrels of oil spread throughout the 
surrounding area and caught fire. Damage caused by the pipeline 
fire is estimated at almost 500 billion lira. [end recording]

  [Text] The PKK [Kurdish Workers Party], which planted a 
bomb at the government building in Diyarbakir, has this time 
targeted civil servants. The PKK militants cut off the 
Diyarbakir-Lice road and abducted 16 people, 14 of them civil 
servants. 
  [Begin off-screen reporter recording] The terrorists stopped 
vehicles travelling from Lice to Diyarbakir near the village of 
Guclu last night and abducted 16 travelers. Some 14 of them 
were civil servants working at various public organizations in 
Lice. Operations are continuing in the region to catch the 
terrorists. 
  Elsewhere, the fire that broke out at the Iraq-Ceyhan crude 
oil pipeline as a result of sabotage has been extinguished. The 
damage is being assessed and efforts are under way to collect 
the crude oil in wells dug by teams of workers. The oil had 
spread to the surrounding area. The valves on the pipeline will 
be replaced before repair work starts. [video shows a sketch

  [Text] Israeli President 'Ezer Weizman has declared that 
Israel will cooperate with Turkey on the subject of terrorism, 
especially in the intelligence field. Weizman met with media 
representatives in Istanbul this morning. Recalling that his 
country suffers greatly from terrorism, Weizman expressed the 
belief that Turkey will also be successful in this area. 
  Weizman said Israel wants to develop cooperation with Turkey 
in the tourism, economic, and political fields, and undertake 
joint investments in third countries. The Southeast Anatolia 
Project will trigger vast developments in the region within in 
the next 10 years, the Israeli president remarked, adding that 
these developments will increase the potential for cooperation 
between the two countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by </F>
Smadar Peri at the Prime Minister's Office in Ankara; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpt] [Peri] Madam Prime Minister, in your first 
meeting with President 'Ezer Weizman this week, you told him 
that your top priority is the war against terrorism. Why? 
  [Ciller] We have a problem of internal terrorism, and I will 
neither permit nor tolerate its continuing. We are the only 
secular democratic state in the Muslim world. We have invested 
more than 50 years in securing these achievements, and I do not 
plan to allow those who murder women and children to spoil 
things for us. 
  [Peri] You have already pointed to the common enemy: 
Hizballah. 
  [Ciller] Definitely. Hizballah not only threatens Israel's 
security but also that of Turkey. It is a real problem. I am 
opposed to terrorism in the name of fundamentalism, and 
Hizballah operates under that slogan. 
  [Peri] As the prime minister of a Muslim state, did you not 
have reservations about announcing publicly that you are 
interested in intelligence, security, and strategic cooperation 
with Israel? Your neighboring states follow your every word. 
  [Ciller] I do not care. I am very interested in any form of 
cooperation between us to uproot terrorism by Hizballah and 
others. I am against anybody who tries to harm stability and 
quiet. I do not care if they know that Israel and Turkey are 
cooperating against Hizballah. 
  [Peri] What kind of strategic cooperation are you 
considering? 
  [Ciller] In intelligence and security, and in any other 
field in which there can be cooperation between professional and 
experienced institutions and organizations. 
  [Peri] With your permission, let us try to analyze President 
al-Asad's possible reaction to your remarks. Israel complains 
about Syria's aid to Hizballah, and you are now in fact 
proposing Israeli-Turkish cooperation against Syria. 
  [Ciller] I definitely support the peace process and good 
relations with Israel. We are interested in assisting in the 
process. In my view, Syria is a key state in the process. The 
key to progress in the negotiations lies with al-Asad. That is 
why we must find a way to make it attractive to him and convince 
him that real peace pays. 
  The Syrians, however, abet terror in Turkey, and they also 
bother you. We, for our part, are willing to do anything to 
encourage Syria to take the path of peace. I get the impression 
that Israel does not need to be encouraged in this. 
  I suggest bilateral strategic cooperation. With your 
experience and expertise, it pays us to look for common points 
and pool our resources. 
  [Peri] I am sure that Tehran is also interested in the plans 
for Israeli-Turkish intelligence cooperation. You have a large 
Iranian Embassy here. Have you tried to send out feelers about 
a dialogue with Israel? 
  [Ciller] I do not believe I or my government should act as 
an intermediary between Israel and Iran, unless both sides ask 
for it. 
  [Peri] Do you actually conduct a dialogue with the Iranians 
in Ankara? Do they not have reservations about the fact that a 
woman is prime minister? 
  [Ciller] The main thing is that they do not interfere with 
us. We have 24 ethnic groups in Turkey, and the terrorists 
murder my citizens in cold blood. I am not prepared to accept 
such despicable murders. 
  I will tell you something: Before each action, the 
terrorists make sure they rid the area of journalists so that 
there will be no witnesses or proof of their deeds. That was 
the case in southeast Anatolia. They want to take over by force 
and chip away chunks of Turkey for themselves, and they threaten 
to murder the women and children of those who hinder them. 
  [Peri] And if you are prevented from selling water to 
Israel? 
  [Ciller] I tell you: I will do whatever I decide with our 
water. We have the water sources, and we will sell water to 
whomever we like. Nobody will decide for me or dictate to me to 
whom to sell our water. I am not prepared to accept threats. 
  We will sell water to Israel, and we are also prepared for 
activity with Israeli antiterror experts. 
  [Peri] You are most likely following the reservations our 
decisionmakers are having about President al-Asad. Israel does 
not know what he really meant when he said "peace." Do you 
understand us? 
  [Ciller] Definitely. I believe Syria could have helped in 
the struggle against terrorism, but it prefers not to. What I 
have just said is an understatement. I know that you complain 
about precisely the same thing. The solution will be found when 
we manage to convince al-Asad that he will be better off without 
terrorism and that he will lose if he does not cooperate.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 25 (XINHUA) -- A man who attempted to 
hijack an Air China plane has been sentenced to life 
imprisonment by a local Chinese court, vice-president of the 
Supreme People's Court Liu Jiachen announced here today. 
  Sun Xianlu, 25, an ex-employee of Tianjin No. 2 steelworks, 
attempted to hijack the Boeing airliner to Taiwan on November 28 
last year. He claimed to be carrying explosives, but was 
overpowered at the airport after the crew adopted measures. 
  The plane landed safely at the airport in Nanjing, capital 
of 
east China's Jiangsu Province, Liu said. 
  The Nanjing Intermediate People's Court sentenced him to 
life 
imprisonment with deprivation of political rights on January 13. 
The verdict took effect today. 
  Liu said that several cases of hijacking occured in China 
over a period, and some of the culprits were debtors, some 
attempted to "seek fortune" overseas, and others have had 
criminal records. 
  China has been consistent in severely cracking down on the 
crime of hijacking, he said. 
  According to the country's criminal law and the decision on 
punishing hijackers of aircraft issued by the Standing Committee 
of the National People's Congress, hijackers must be severely 
punished, with the death penalty in the most serious cases. 
  At the end of 1993 an agreement was reached between the 
mainland-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait and the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation. Both 
sides came to a common understanding that hijacking is a serious 
crime and hijackers should be severely punished. 
  They agreed in principle that all hijackers will be sent 
back 
to where they came from, Liu noted.

  [Text] Zamboanga City -- Southern Command Chief Lt. Gen. 
Thelmo Cunanan has ordered his commanders to tighten security in 
all public places in Mindanao. 
  Cunanan gave the order following information that the group 
of terrorists responsible for the blasts at the San Pedro 
Cathedral and two Muslim mosques in Davao City last month has 
transferred operations to other areas. 
  The military and police were ordered to secure places like 
churches, markets and groceries, where there are crowds. 
  He asked the public to bear with the inconvenience and 
discomfort of checkpoints and inspections. 
  Meanwhile, Cunanan said police operations will continue 
against criminal elements despite the cease fire with the Moro 
National Liberation Front. 
  "We will pursue these criminal elements wherever they are. 
We are already taking action against them," Cunanan said. 
  He said the extremist Abu Sayaf is one of the groups hunted 
by the military and the police. 
  As this developed, former Sulu Representative Sakur Tan 
confirmed that the Abu Sayaf group has increased in number and 
are equipped with highpowered armament. 
  Tan, the principal negotiator in the release Monday of 
shipyard owner Ricardo Tong after 139 days of captivity, said he 
witnessed the gathering up of the Abu Sayaf group when he had a 
talk with two of the group's leaders somewhere in Patikul, Sulu.

<F P=106> [Report by Willie Melgar from the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Dozens of peasants from the southern coast and other 
regions this morning participated in a demonstration to demand 
higher salaries for agricultural work. Roadblocks were erected 
at the end of the Raul Aguilar Batres Road, in Zone 12 of the 
capital, where the demonstrators also burned many tires. 
  It was reported that peasants, who are traveling to the 
capital from other regions to demand a daily minimum pay of 20 
quetzals, are staging similar demonstrations. A witness reported 
that this morning's demonstration on the Raul Aguilar Batres 
Road nearly caused a fight between the demonstrators and 
residents of the El Mesquital neighborhood. 
  Meanwhile, several terrorist devices planted near power 
pylons were defused the evening of 27 January. The police made 
this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified police official] In the past 
few hours, based on people's calls and reports, and thanks to 
the citizens' cooperation, we were able to defuse a bomb planted 
near one of the pylons in Villanueva. We can see it from here. 
Bomb technicians defused this bomb at 0200 because of the 
possible damage it could have caused to nearby houses. This 
device contained aluminized [aluminizada] gunpowder, which is 
what has been used to damage the pylons. 
  We found wire used for electrical installations. We found 
the 
power source: a nine-volt battery. We found part of a timing 
device. As you can see, this is a clock face. This was found at 
the downed pylon in Barcenas-Villanueva. We also found 
electrical wire and a timing device, which included this clock, 
at the pylon in Zone 18 in Las Ilusiones. 
  This debris suggests a time bomb was involved. The debris 
was 
found at two places. Bomb technicians, honoring their motto to 
protect the citizens, have worked around the clock and have 
shown up wherever they were needed. 
  Five explosive devices of this sort were defused at Los 
Antojitos Restaurant on Roosevelt Road at 0800 today. You can 
see them here. We urge citizens to continue to help us. We want 
them to call the telephone numbers that were announced. We do 
not want them to take any chances because we are ready to defuse 
such devices at any time. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] where were they found? 
  [Police official] All the bombs shown here were among those 
defused in urban and rural areas. The work was done by explosive 
technicians. We are showing them to the citizens to ensure they 
can identify such devices. We want them to report any findings. 
We do not want them to take any risks. Above all, we want them 
to warn children, who have been the main victims so far. This 
was the case in the grenade explosions in Mazatenango. We want 
to prevent this. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, peasant organizations from the countryside and 
southern coast marched today toward Guatemala City to demand a 
wage of 22.4 quetzals for countryside workers. The peasant 
organizations want national and international human rights 
groups, especially the United Nations and International Labor 
Organization, to pay attention to their problems. 
  Leaflets distributed during the demonstration carried 
messages like: We denounce the unjust and shameful starvation 
wages paid by farm owners in the rural areas of Coban, Alta 
Verapaz, Baja Verapaz, Peten, and Izabal. We demand that 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio decree a 22.4 quetzal wage 
increase for peasants right away because his goal is to fight 
poverty, which is what he has repeatedly claimed in the media. 
We demand the freedom to organize, mobilize, demonstrate, and 
speak out in keeping with Articles 34 and 35 as well as other 
articles of the Constitution. 
  We say no to [word indistinct] and forced recruitment. We 
say 
no to the popular referendum because it is another attempt to 
deceive the people and because the people are not allowed to 
participate. 
  People: Do not allow the same people to deceive us. Join the 
struggle because it is the only path. Unican is here!

  [Text] A terrorist attack which caused a blackout in a 
large part of Guatemala and diverse acts of violence contributed 
this Thursday to create a climate of unrest in the country. 
This has occurred on the eve of a public workers strike, which 
according to the strike promoters, will be joined by over 
200,000 workers. The uncertainty heightened in the wake of the 
decision by the Transportation Coordinating Board to paralyze 
activities this coming Tuesday. This measure could leave the 
country without a normal fuel supply during the strike. 
  The explosion that we mentioned earlier injured three 
persons 
who were identified as: Lydia Bolanos, 32; Carlos Bolanos, 35; 
and Ramon Hernandez, 32. Mrs. Bolanos is employed by the 
computer section of the National Police and happened to be 
passing by the area. The shrapnel scattered up to a radius of 
5 km, reaching the Kennedy and Galilea neighborhoods of Zone 18. 
[sentence as heard] 
  There were reports of other bomb explosions in the outlying 
part of the city, in Panorama neighborhood in the city of San 
Cristobal. 
  [Begin recording] [Volunteer firefighter Aguirre] Thus far 
we 
have received reports of three bomb blasts that occurred in Las 
Ilusiones neighborhood in Zone 18 where the electricity towers 
were damaged. Also, it was reported that another electricity 
tower was damaged on the Pacific highway at the 22-km marker. 
Our units were dispatched to the area and are searching for 
possible casualties. Also, we received a report of another bomb 
explosion in Panorama in the city of San Cristobal. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Aguirre, can you tell us if 
these 
bombs have caused any casualties? 
  [Aguirre] Yes, we learned that three persons injured in 
Ilusiones neighborhood were taken to the general hospital in 
Zone 6 for emergency treatment. 
  [Reporter] How badly were they injured? 
  [Aguirre] Up to the moment, we learned that they sustained 
cuts, bruises and injuries to several parts of their bodies. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Aguirre, can you tell us about a gasoline 
station on fire in Zone 11? 
  [Aguirre] Yes, at this moment units 29, 31, and 37 are 
trying 
to control a big fire on 16th Street in Zone 11. Thus far it is 
not known what caused the fire. [end recording]

  [Text) Guatemala City, 27 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- A powerful 
dynamite charge exploded at an electric power pylon at 2125 
tonight, which left Guatemala City as well as the departments of 
Chimaltenango and Escuintla without power. The National Police 
report the explosion inflicted damage at the Guatemala-Norte 
station, east of Guatemala City, which distributes electricity 
from the Chixoy hydroelectric plant. 
  The terrorist act caused traffic jams in various parts of 
the 
city with traffic lights going out. Meanwhile, authorities from 
the National Electric Institute are working to restore power. 
The incident occurred 72 hours prior to the vote on a referendum 
to approve or reject 37 constitutional reforms. 
  In addition, military sources reported that Guatemalan Army 
troops sustained five casualties when they clashed with a column 
of the Revolutionary Organization of the Peoples in Arms (ORPA) 
at La Igualdad farm in La Reforma. 
  Soldier Julio Lopez Chavez told NOTIMEX that at 1300 the 1st 
and 3d Companies of the San Marcos Detachment searched La 
Igualdad farm, 280 km to the west of Guatemala City, where the 
guerrillas mined the field. The two Army companies detected the 
presence of the 15 ORPA rebels, who retreated to a very deep and 
rocky area when they noticed they had been discovered. 
  The soldiers proceeded to comb the area in search of the 
rebels. Two soldiers, Mauricio Hernandez Chun and Jose Pacual 
Merlo, died when they activated a claymore mine. Three soldiers 
were also injured by shrapnel from the mines. The soldiers' 
bodies and the injured soldiers were transferred to Coatepeque 
on the San Marcos Department border.

  [Text] Alleged URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity] cells downed and destroyed three power transmission 
towers last night. This happened in Las Ilusiones, Zone 18, 
Villa del Dorado, Zone 8, and the Ulises Rojas neighborhood at 
the 21-km marker on the Pacific highway, Villa Nueva 
Jurisdiction. Powerful charges downed the towers, causing a 
blackout in Guatemala City and the interior of the country. The 
blast hit Lirio Bolanos Rosas, a National Police employee of the 
National Police, on Zone 18, and had to be hospitalized. Last 
night and early this morning, technicians of the electricity 
company and INDE [National Institute of Electrification] 
estimated the damage caused at 500,000 quetzales. They did not 
make estimates on the serious damage the blackout caused to 
homes, hospitals, clinics, and computer centers, as well as to 
citizens who were the victims of crimes perpetrated under cover 
of the hour-long blackout in Guatemala City. The bomb squad 
defused a powerful device in the Ulises Rojas Neighborhood.

  [Text] A year and four months after his imprisonment the 
image of Shining Path [SL] leader Abimael Guzman, who will spend 
the rest of his life in prison, is deteriorating in the eyes of 
dissident members of his criminal organization. 
  The number of attacks carried out by this gang on the 
birthdays of Abimael Guzman and Mao Zedong last December in Lima 
shows that the SL "commemorated" Mao's birthday with a greater 
number of actions than they did for "President Gonzalo," which 
demonstrates the deterioration of his image. This can be 
understood from statistics recorded by the Institute for 
National Defense Research (Iniden). 
  According to Iniden, during the second half of 1993 Shining 
Path carried out 346 actions, killing 308 people -- including 
civilian and military -- which is a lower figure compared to the 
same period of the previous year. 
  In a document sent to this newspaper, Iniden states that 
most 
of the SL actions in December were concentrated near two dates: 
December 3, Abimael Guzman's birthday, and December 26, Mao's 
100th birthday. 
  Faithful to the purest SL style, the document states, the 
two 
"commemorations" consisted of a wave of terrorist attacks. This 
means that from 2 to 5 December, the Shining Path carried out 18 
attacks, and from 24 to 29 December, 24 attacks. 
  By the quality of the targets and the number of attacks, the 
document states, it can be deduced that Mao was much more 
"commemorated" than Guzman. 
  Iniden states that the attacks must not be considered as the 
Shining Path's last resort, or as isolated attacks, although "it 
must not be ignored that such low figures for SL attacks have 
not been seen since 1992." 
  In a long, thorough analysis Iniden reports that the Shining 
Path has ceased to be a threat to Peruvian political 
feasibility. It nonetheless counsels the public not to be 
overly optimistic given the escalation of its attacks. 
  The document states that for some people the new wave of SL 
violence was carried out apparently with the pretext of 
"commemorating" the birthday of Abimael Guzman and Mao's 100th 
birthday. 
  For some analysts, the escalation of the violence was meant 
to "maintain Guzman's negotiating capacity" and to make the SL 
members in prison considered political or war prisoners, in 
order to obtain their freedom once peace is "negotiated." 
  The document also points out the existence of a radical SL 
group that does not accept a solution other than continuing with 
the "armed struggle," a situation that does not allow them to 
carry out negotiations for peace. 
  "This latter group does not think in the same way as the 
imprisoned SL leaders and their followers," the Iniden document 
states.

New Security Alliance Between Ankara and Tel Aviv: Turkish 
Commando Units To Receive Israeli Assistance in Gaining Access 
to al-Biqa'; Reasons Why Turkey Joined U.S.-Israeli Campaign To 
Close in on Damascus; Ankara Sets Up Special Militias, Using 
Kurds, Turkish Hizballah To Fight Kurds; Turkish Military Plan 
To Pursue PKK in Syria."] 
  [Text] There is more than the Kurdistan Workers' Party 
[PKK] behind the campaign of military threats Turkey has been 
mounting against Syria for some time. Information obtained by 
AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI affirms that Turkey's minister of foreign 
affairs returned from his "historic" visit to Israel with a plan 
for the two countries to cooperate on security matters. This 
would involve the implementation of a Turkish military plan to 
send commando units to al-Biqa' and to Syria under the pretext 
of shelling the PKK's positions. However, the real objective of 
this plan, which received Washington's blessing, was to drag 
Syria into the peace process by closing in on it and 
intensifying the pressure on it. What are the particulars of 
this plan? Why did Turkey reveal the Israeli cards it has been 
holding at this time in particular? And what will it receive as 
its payback? 
  Late last October, an emergency secret meeting was called by 
Tansu Ciller, the prime minister of Turkey. The meeting was held 
in her office, the prime minister's office in Ankara, and it was 
attended by Ms. Ciller; by Mehmet Golhan, the minister of 
defense; and by Dogan Gures, the chief of staff of Turkey's 
armed forces. 
  At that meeting Ciller stressed the need to adopt a new 
military action plan to fight what she called Kurdish terrorism. 
She was referring specifically to operations by the PKK, which 
is led by Abdullah Ocalan, also known as Apo. Recently, these 
operations took a grave turn for the worse when General Aydin, 
the chief of police, was assassinated in Diyarbakir. Aydin's 
assassination aggravated Turkey's official position to such a 
degree that Ciller removed Nevzat Ayaz, the minister of defense, 
from his position. Ciller then issued very strong statements, 
threatening neighboring countries who were supporting "Kurdish 
terrorism." [She was referring] specifically to Syria and Iran. 
  Ciller started her meeting with senior military officials 
with a pessimistic pronouncement expressing her disappointment 
with the failure of previous military plans. She called for the 
application of a new, more repressive strategy aimed at putting 
an end to "Kurdish terrorism" once and for all. Application of 
this strategy would start now, and it would continue through the 
end of 1994. Ciller angrily pointed out to those officials that 
their former strategy will have to be considered a failure, and 
she read in front of them the most recent security report 
prepared by Turkish intelligence. The report explained the 
particulars of the strict security and military measures that 
had recently been taken to pursue armed Kurds in southeast and 
east Anatolia. More than 150,000 soldiers supported by the most 
modern tanks, armored vehicles, explosives, and war planes had 
been deployed in the region. Militias made up of Kurdish area 
residents were utilized, and weapons as well as monthly salaries 
were sometimes placed at their disposal to secure their 
assistance in pursuing the armed Kurds. The Turkish army was 
using all forms of repression against the population. Sometimes, 
entire villages were burned, and the residents of those villages 
were driven out of their homes. Although all Turkish security 
agencies--the army, police soldiers, police officers, 
intelligence officers, and special forces--took part in all 
these battles and operations, Ciller herself asserts that they 
were not able to bring about a resolution of the military 
situation. Nor were they able to stop attacks by the PKK's 
forces against security personnel, tourists, trains, and 
economic facilities. 
  Ciller then asked the new minister of defense to give her 
his 
analysis of the reasons why the strategy had failed and [his 
assessment] of the strength of the PKK fighters. He replied, 
"Our information indicates that the PKK has more than 10,000 
fighters, and perhaps 15,000. Kurdish residents who support the 
PKK do so either out of conviction or as a result of coercion. 
The problem, however, lies in the support the PKK is receiving 
from outside the Turkish borders, because it is that support 
that is allowing the PKK to make preparations for its 
operations, to train its operatives, and to supply itself with 
weapons. This is what is happening in Iran, in Iraq, and even in 
Syria. It is also happening in the PKK's camps in Lebanon's 
al-Biqa' Valley." 
<H5>  A New Strategy </H5>
  The Turkish prime minister shuddered and said, "They have to 
be stopped. This is a crucial matter for the stability of 
Turkey's security, economy, and international standing. A new 
plan to fight terrorism must be devised, and everything has to 
be utilized in that fight, even if we have to fight battles in 
Iran, Iraq, and Syria and risk the danger of war breaking out 
with those countries." Ciller then took out from one of the 
drawers in her desk a report, which had been prepared for her by 
military intelligence. She briefed the two men who were meeting 
with her about the main points of that report, and she said that 
it was incumbent on us to move in that direction and to prepare 
an integrated military plan. 
  Ciller issued a new, strong statement after that meeting, 
threatening Iran and Syria with a campaign to pursue the 
terrorists inside their territories. After all, the terrorists 
had been pursued for years inside Iraqi territory, and Iraqi 
Kurds subordinate to Barzani and Talabani have been taking part 
in those operations. Most Turkish military personnel and 
politicians joined this stepped-up pursuit of the Kurds, and 
Turkey's chief of staff declared, "We will put an end to the PKK 
before the spring of 1994." 
  In early November it was noticed that Syria was the focus of 
the campaign mounted by Turkish officials. They would sometimes 
accuse Syria of offering the PKK support and giving it refuge on 
Syrian territory, and at other times they would raise once again 
the issue of PKK camps in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley as well as 
that of increased Kurdish operations near the Syrian-Turkish 
borders. Last week Turkey's intensified political and media 
campaign against Syria became extremely brazen, and its 
implications became very grave when Hikmet Cetin, the minister 
of foreign affairs in Ankara, took advantage of his visit to 
Israel--it was the first such visit--and repeated the threat to 
Syria. But Cetin added other indications to the threat when he 
spoke unequivocally about "the need for cooperation between 
Israel and Ankara to fight against Syrian supported terrorism." 
Cetin accused Damascus of continuing its support for the PKK, 
and he revealed upon returning to his country that "a new stage 
in Turkey's relationship with Israel had begun." He reiterated 
his rejection of the prospect that some areas of the Middle East 
turn into free zones for terrorist activity. Cetin went further 
than that in his military statements when he said that Turkey 
"intended to respond to any terrorist action launched directly 
or indirectly from its neighbors' territory. Such an issue could 
not possibly be left without resolution." He added, "The future 
of relations with Syria depends first of all on the elimination 
of terrorism." 
  The implications of the warning issued by Ankara were 
quickly 
grasped by those who have been watching developments and 
monitoring the secrets of Turkish politics and the question of 
the PKK. And yet, given the public and unequivocal entry of 
Israel into the picture, these observers wondered with 
considerable concern about the implications of the warning and 
its [possible] aftermath. They wondered, specifically, about 
what Turkey and Israel had in store for Syria, the country which 
was obviously becoming the object of attention, and they 
wondered also about the roles the new Turkish-Israeli alliance 
would play in the region. 
  Information available to AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI affirms that 
Turkey's minister of foreign affairs visited Israel against the 
backdrop of the new strategy devised by Turkey's military and 
political leaders. The Turkish minister's visit to Israel was 
not made in the context of making a contribution to promote the 
peace process. The Turkish minister did not go to Israel to play 
a part in the multilateral negotiations and in [the talks over] 
the problem of water. The minister went to Israel in an attempt 
to put an end to the PKK and in an effort to get Israel to make 
a security contribution to that effort. The magnitude of that 
contribution could become greater in light of developments in 
the peace process. 
  This information indicates that Turkey's new military plan, 
which was approved to fight the PKK, includes a declaration of 
some sort indicating that all the [country's] military 
capabilities would be mobilized and all of Turkey's regional and 
international cards would be utilized to bring about the success 
of the plan. Turkey's new military plan is based on increasing 
the number of personnel in the Turkish army from 700,000 to 1 
million soldiers. Military operations against PKK fighters in 
Turkey would be stepped up, and those PKK fighters would be 
pursued on land and in the air inside Iran's, Iraq's, and 
Syria's borders, even if clashes with these countries' forces 
were to become necessary and lead to the creation of tension in 
relations with them. In conjunction with this plan Ankara would 
go back to using the waters of the Euphrates as a weapon to 
apply pressure to Damascus. 
  The new plan would also continue the policy of planting 
mines 
on the borders and moving forward with the establishment of an 
electronic security zone along the border with Syria. This plan, 
whose estimated cost exceeds $10 million, is being implemented 
in close cooperation with Israeli military experts. This close 
cooperation on security matters came about after Israel's 
military experts persuaded Turkey to set up a security zone 
similar to Israel's security zone in south Lebanon and to 
improve upon it. 
  However, new developments in the Turkish security plan--and 
AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI was able to obtain details of this 
plan--place emphasis on a larger role that Turkish intelligence 
and special commando units would be playing in going after PKK 
fighters in Turkey and in Iran, Syria, and Lebanon as well. To 
this end, Ciller quickly approved the establishment of a 
"special army." That is, she approved the establishment of 
private militias that would not be officially affiliated with 
the Turkish armed forces. These militias would be made up of 
ordinary citizens who would be trained in combat, infiltration, 
and explosive techniques. Included in that army also would be 
Kurds from all countries, who are known for their support for 
Turkey and their work for Turkish intelligence. That is, Kurds 
from Iran, Iraq, and Syria would be included in that army, which 
would also include units made up of Turkish Muslims, known as 
Turkey's Hizballah, a group which has been engaged in war 
against the PKK for quite some time. 
<H5>  Turkish Commandos in al-Biqa' Valley </H5>
  What will be the role of those militias? Based on 
information 
that has been leaked about the Turkish plan, it seems that 
military and political leaders in Ankara will charge those 
militias with the task of carrying out sabotage operations in 
Iran and Syria. Those militias would conduct 
counter-infiltration operations across the borders, and they 
would penetrate the ranks of other Kurds. This information adds 
that emphasis in the Turkish plan is still being placed on 
shelling PKK camps in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley and that 
consideration is also being given to shelling some of the PKK's 
locations in Syria. 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam, the vice president of 
Syria, declared unequivocally that his country would not condone 
having "any party use Syrian territory as a base from which the 
security of any neighboring country would be violated." No 
international source nor even any anti-Syrian intelligence 
agency has so far confirmed the possibility that Turkey's 
accusations might be valid. 
  Information available to AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI indicates that 
the Turkish military plan to shell the PKK's positions in 
al-Biqa' Valley was the subject of the security talks which were 
conducted in Israel by Ankara's minister of foreign affairs. 
That [in fact] was the main purpose of the visit. It is known 
that economic cooperation between the two countries underwent 
significant development in recent years and that the volume and 
nature of trade has been such that large amounts of Turkish 
water have been exported on oil tankers which dock periodically 
in the port of Haifa. The Jewish lobby, which exercises strong 
influence in Turkey, played a major role in reinforcing the 
growing closeness between these two countries on political and 
security issues. Turkey and Israel, located in an Arab and 
Islamic world, share a concern about their relationship with 
Europe, and they also share the role of defending Western and 
U.S. interests in the context of NATO, an organization in which 
Israel plays a supporting role. In the past years Israel started 
applying Ben Gurion's theory of "a small zone around the Arab 
world," which means relying on Turkey and the Shah's Iran to 
form a ring around all the borders of the Arab world. Israel 
decided to expand that zone around the Arab world after the 
collapse of the Soviet Union by extending it across the Islamic 
republics in Central Asia. It penetrated these countries with 
the cooperation and coordination of Turkey, which was motivated 
by domestic, regional, and international goals and aspirations. 
This cooperation between Israel and Turkey strengthened the 
cooperation between the two countries on security matters to 
"fight terrorism." Ankara received significant services from 
Israel, and those services transferred to Turkey the Israelis' 
expertise in [dealing with] "terrorism." The Turks even received 
detailed reports about the PKK camps in al-Biqa' Valley. These 
reports included maps and photographs as well as information 
about the movements of the party's leaders and the training of 
its elements. 
  Cetin's recent visit to Israel served as a shot in the arm 
for the cooperation between the two countries. Information 
affirms that Israel did approve a protocol for some of the 
temporary bases that will be used by Turkish commando units on 
the Lebanese border strip. Israel agreed to offer these units 
all necessary assistance that would enable them to gain access 
to al-Biqa' Valley, hit PKK positions, and return [to their 
bases] by way of Israel. 
  But the question that is being asked by observers is this: 
Why did Turkey decide to increase the tension between it and 
Syria at this time in particular? Why did it decide to bring its 
strategic alliances with Israel out in the open? Given the fact 
that a strategic alliance with Israel implies not only open 
hostility to Syria but also to the Arabs, why did Turkey decide 
to do this before the peace process ran its course? Why did it 
decide to do this at a time when the region appears to be 
starting to move toward a comprehensive peace as well as 
regional economic cooperation among all the parties? 
<H5>  A Ring Around Syria </H5>
  It is known that the latest crisis between Turkey and Syria 
over the PKK is not the first such crisis between them. That 
crisis between the two countries, who had previously defused the 
tension between them, had almost led Ankara to launch a water 
war against Damascus. That situation was defused by means of two 
high level security protocols, the first of which was signed in 
1987. The latter, which was signed last year, affirmed that 
problems between the two countries had been resolved and that 
the two neighbors had agreed to get rid of the bone of 
contention between them that had been caused by the PKK. At that 
time contention over the PKK had led Ankara to threaten strikes 
against PKK positions in al-Biqa' Valley. 
  Observers today are wondering in bewilderment about what it 
was that they missed that caused Turkey to step up its campaign 
against Syria and to make such threats against it. Why would 
Turkey go so far as to declare its cooperation with Israel on 
security matters? These observers point out that the fatal blows 
that are being delivered by the PKK against Turkey are ones that 
for the most part are delivered by PKK operations carried out 
inside Turkish territory. These operations affirm that the 
party's constituency and its power base are in Turkey and not 
elsewhere. 
  That is why observers acted promptly to find other reasons 
and other goals for the Turkish-Israeli campaign against 
Damascus. It is now certain--and this was revealed by AL-WATAN 
AL-'ARABI in issue number 870 dated 5 November 1993--that this 
issue is not a simple one, but that it is rather complicated and 
involves many other issues and concerns. Turkey is using the PKK 
issue with Syria to achieve regional and international 
objectives that are no longer a secret to anyone. That is, 
Turkey is trying to contribute to the effort to set up a ring 
around Syria, to isolate it, and to drag it into the peace 
process. Informed sources are saying that when the prime 
minister of Turkey returned from Washington some weeks ago, she 
appeared to have received the kind of support that strengthened 
and emboldened her. She started her campaign against Syria by 
coordinating it with Washington and Tel Aviv. It was noticed 
that coordination in this campaign placed special emphasis on 
the terrorism issue, which is an international winner. While 
Israel tried to undermine Syria's international reputation by 
raising the issue of its support for "Hizballah terrorists" and 
the resistance in Lebanon, Ankara chose to dwell on the support 
which Damascus has been giving "Kurdish terrorism." That theme 
is heard with sympathy in the West because the PKK kidnaps 
foreign tourists and adopts a strategy of carrying out 
operations with explosives in European countries against Turkish 
interests. It is obvious that the payback Turkey is asking for, 
namely, to become a visible member of an Israeli-American 
alliance, is one that will strengthen its position for achieving 
what it has been aspiring to and striving for. Turkey wants to 
become a major power in the region, and it wants to work with 
the United States to spread its influence in Central Asia as the 
Soviet Union's successor. Turkey wants to penetrate Eastern 
Europe by way of the Balkans, and it wants to have the right to 
represent the West in the Middle East on an equal footing with 
Israel. Turkey wants to benefit from the possible outcome of the 
post-peace period. 
  Turkey's more obvious goal, however, is that of forming a 
ring around Syria, preventing it from trying to foil the 
Gaza-Jericho Agreement, and applying pressure on it to make it 
join the peace process in Sidon with a weaker position and with 
fewer cards. 
  That is why the Syrians regarded the threat that was made by 
Cetin in Israel as obvious and expected. Consequently, their 
reaction to it was cool and unruffled, because Turkey's action 
to carry out such threats and declare the zero hour for the new 
Turkish military plan depends, as Turkey's previous threats did, 
on the balance [of power] and the variables in the region. The 
implementation of Turkey's threats and new military plan depends 
also on developments in the talks and on the results of 
Christopher's visit to the region, which is scheduled for next 
month. The outcome of all that remains to be seen. Until then 
Turkey will keep the issue of the PKK alive, and it will 
continue making threats.

  [Text] AL-AHALI has learned that several terrorist leaders 
residing abroad will be handed over to the Egyptian authorities 
in the near future in line with agreements recently signed with 
several Arab and other foreign countries. 
  Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi worked hard to 
conclude the agreements with these countries during a recent 
Arab interior ministers' conference in Tunisia. The countries 
with whom agreements were signed include a neighboring country, 
a non-neighboring country that is suffering internal conflicts, 
and a major Gulf country, which set the condition that the 
agreement must not be made public in order to avoid terrorist 
reprisals! 
  Following security negotiations with Egypt, Denmark arrested 
Tal'at Fu'ad Qasim, the most prominent al-Jihad leader abroad, 
and several other leading figures of that organization. Some 
Danish parliamentarians are opposing their being handed over to 
Egypt, however, on the grounds that Egyptian law provides for 
the death penalty, which these parliamentarians regard as 
violating human rights. 
  Egyptian security departments have sent high-level 
delegations to Afghanistan and Pakistan to sign similar 
agreements. Domestic events in Afghanistan have held up talks 
with that country.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Bari] </F>
  [Text] Investigations by the security organs have revealed 
that Samir Isma'il Salih, a Palestinian student attending 
al-Azhar Institute in al-Zaytun, had strong links with Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement]. "Coded" messages issued by the 
Hamas leadership in the occupied territories were found in 
Salih's possession. The messages contain instructions from 
Hamas for suicide operations to be waged against policemen in 
retaliation for what the group called repressive measures 
against brothers in jihad in Egypt. 
  A responsible security source told AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I's 
legal 
editor that preliminary information indicates a foreign security 
service has infiltrated Hamas and is steering it toward 
supporting terrorists locked in armed confrontation with the 
Egyptian security organs, in an effort to destabilize Egypt. 
  The security source said that Hamas, while involved in 
supporting Egyptian terrorists, remains unaware of being 
infiltrated by the foreign security service. 
  The source disclosed that the raid on a terrorist stronghold 
in al-Ma'sarah [a southern suburb of Cairo] came after 
investigations showed that a number of individuals living in 
that area had been involved in attacks against policemen. 
  One notorious terrorist, Tharwat Hajjaj, however, managed to 
escape the police dragnet, together with his wife and three 
children. Two others, Muhammad Ahmad Farhan and Samir Salih, 
were captured. 
  The source added that the Egyptian security service had 
information showing Hamas's support of terrorists but lacked 
material evidence. The arrest of the Palestinian student 
provided us with that evidence, he stated. 
  [Cairo AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic in a related report published 
on pp 1, 4 of its 22 January issue says: "A high-ranking 
security source has denied a press report on the involvement of 
a certain Palestinian organization in terrorist acts in Egypt. 
The source said that terrorist Samir Salih has been living in 
Cairo for some time and that terrorists succeeded in recruiting 
him."]

  [Text] Cairo, 22 Jan (MENA) -- Suspect Sami Salih, who was 
arrested in connection with the al-Ma'sarah incident Wednesday, 
has confessed that he is a member of a terrorist organization 
consisting of about 15 people and led by terrorist Tharwat 
Hajjaj. 
  The suspect told the Higher State Security Prosecution today 
that he conveyed instructions from some leading elements in 
Afghanistan to his colleagues. 
  He said he took part in the attack against the Majidah and 
al-Marwah movie houses in Hulwan, the attack on a tourist bus in 
Misr al-Qadimah, and a number of other terrorist acts. 
  Salih said he and others who frequented the apartments they 
rented in al-Ma'sarah made bombs and explosives to use in 
terrorist attacks. 
  He confessed that before his arrest in al-Ma'sarah on 
Wednesday, he and terrorists Muhammad Ahmad Farhan and Tharwat 
Hajjaj threw bombs at security forces. Hajjaj managed to flee.

  [Text] The security organs in al-Jizah, in coordination 
with the state Security Intelligence Service, launched a 
large-scale security campaign at 0500 yesterday. The campaign, 
which lasted until 0900, targeted the areas of Ka'abish, 
al-Thalath Tawabiq, 'Izbat 'Fakihah, Kafr al-Mansi, al-Jabal, 
Bulaq, and the pyramids. The security forces captured 148 
suspects, including seven extremist terrorist elements, and 
seized a quantity of automatic and semi-automatic weapons. All 
the defendants were referred to the prosecution for 
interrogation. 
  Major General Fahim Husayn, assistant interior minister for 
al-Jizah security, ordered the al-Jizah security forces to raid 
the terrorists' lairs in coordination with the state Security 
Intelligence Service. Secret information received confirmed the 
terrorists' intention to carry out operations targeting the 
police, especially during the Police Day celebrations. The 
security forces launched their raids at 0500 yesterday in the 
areas of Ka'abish and al-Thalath Taqwabiq. They arrested 88 
suspects, including the seven extremist terrorists. 
  A responsible security source said that one of these seven 
terrorists was involved in the recent incidents in Imbabah, 
Bulaq, al-Dakrur, and al-Ma'sarah. The source added that the 
interrogation of the group confirmed their membership in a new 
organization that planned to attack policemen, especially on 
Police Day. 
  The AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I correspondent learned that the raids 
were carried out by more than 80 officers and about 300 soldiers 
equipped with modern weapons and armored vehicles and supported 
by a number of fire engines in anticipation of any clashes with 
the extremist elements. 
  The raids were carried out without any resistance from the 
targeted elements and not a single bullet was fired. 
  At the same time, another group raided the areas of Kafr 
Tuhurmis and the villages of 'Abd-al-'Al and al-Mashabik. Some 
46 suspects were arrested and the prosecution began their 
interrogation. 
  A security source said that the interrogation of the 
terrorist group is being held in total secrecy and the release 
of their names will be delayed.

  [Text] The Shining Path [SL] dissident faction on 24 
January rejected the actions carried out by members of the 
Shining Path leadership to reach "a peace agreement" with the 
government and labeled them "capitulators, informers, and 
cowards." 
  The manifesto is a reply to a letter released on 23 January 
in which many Shining Path inmates expressed their "decided and 
total support for the strategic decision" of Abimael Guzman to 
negotiate peace with the government. 
  The dissident SL faction's manifesto was sent to several 
Lima 
newspapers and signed by a so-called SL Lima Regional Committee 
and a "Committee of Relatives of Peruvian Political Prisoners, 
Prisoners of War, and Missing People." This latter committee, 
which presents itself as an SL military branch for the first 
time, apparently has abandoned its semi-legal status and decided 
to go underground. 
  The dissident faction is headed by Oscar Ramirez Durand, 
alias "Comrade Feliciano," who allegedly is responsible for the 
attacks that took place in Lima in December on the occasion of 
Mao's 100th birthday. 
  The dissidents use violent language against those who 
approve 
of the peace initiative ("revisionist bitch's excrement") and 
accuse them of being "servants of Yankee imperialism." 
  The threats are aimed against the members of the SL 
leadership, including Osman Morote Barrionuevo, Martha Huatay, 
Maria Pantoja, and Edmundo Cox Beuzeville, among others. 
  According to the manifesto, those SL leaders want to murder 
Guzman, whom the dissidents continue to respect as their leader. 
According to analysts consulted by this daily, this demonstrates 
the desperate efforts this dissident faction is making to make 
their decimated followers believe that their top leader is not 
aware of the peace negotiations, when it is widely known to the 
public that Guzman himself has sent several letters to the 
government asking for a peace agreement.

  [Text] Lima, 31 Jan (AFP) -- The Maoist organization 
Shining Path has stated it will continue its 13-year military 
struggle. According to its official newspaper EL DIARIO, which 
was sent to the Lima media on Monday, an "impostor" took the 
place of its imprisoned leader, Abimael Guzman, to issue an 
appeal for peace to the Peruvian Government in October 1993. 
  EL DIARIO said, "We know reactionary people have Guzman 
hidden and isolated in the Navy's dungeons. We reject the 
October video, which presents an impostor, a man they prepared 
for over a year to replace Guzman on television." 
  Shining Path thinks the government's campaign for "a peace 
agreement justifies the assassination of President Gonzalo 
(Guzman)," and so it asks that the health of its leader, who was 
arrested in September 1992 and is currently serving a life 
sentence at the naval base in El Callao, "be taken care of." 
  Nevertheless, the opposition magazine SI claims, in its 
Monday edition, an uneasiness prevails among high command 
members of the Navy, who are in charge of Guzman's custody, over 
the meetings held between the Shining Path leader and the 
imprisoned leaders of the organization at the officers' club in 
El Callao Naval Base. 
  According to official information, during those meetings 
they 
wrote the letters from Guzman and his comrade, Elena 
Iparraguirre (one letter remains unpublished), issuing an appeal 
for peace; and another one along those same lines from four 
imprisoned leaders. 
  SI magazine reports, citing reliable sources, that Shining 
Path's demands to achieve a peace agreement include "a general 
amnesty for all of its imprisoned activists," so they can hold a 
congress to establish the groundwork for peace. 
  The magazine, along with all Peruvian media, thinks a 
division prevails within the Shining Path between the group 
which advocates peace, led by Guzman, and a group of 
"hard-liners" who do not want to end the armed struggle, which 
began in 1980 and which is represented by leaders who are still 
at large. 
  Conversely, EL DIARIO calls the division "false" and denies 
Guzman wants peace; it does admit the imprisoned activists 
include a handful of "capitulators, now lackeys of the 
dictatorship (President Alberto Fujimori's Government), who are 
trying to plant the idea of capitulation among the people." 
  EL DIARIO also publishes a statement from female Shining 
Path 
members, currently at the women's prison in Lima, who also 
recognize the existence of "a small revisionist, black group of 
capitulators that wave the flags of peace while shouting threats 
that will have deadly consequences." 
  To conclude, the January edition of the Shining Path 
newspaper, which is banned in Peru and the possession of which 
is proof of active participation in the organization -- a fact 
that may be punished with a life sentence -- is exclusively 
dedicated to proving its total loyalty to Guzman.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on insurgent activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian 
papers monitored through 3 February. 
  The Ayacucho Political-Military Command announced the arrest 
of seven "terrorists" southwest of Ayacucho Department. One of 
the main leaders has been identified as Pablo Condori Vega, 44, 
"Comrade Castro," who is considered a leader in Puquio, the 
capital of Pucanas Province. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 20 Jan 
94 p A13) 
  "Terrorists" exploded 10 kg of dynamite in downtown Huancayo 
at 1915 on 23 January in the parking lot of Hotel President, 
destroying three vehicles and seriously damaging the hotel. 
(Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 25 Jan 94 p A7) 
  General Alfredo Rodriguez Rivera, new commander of the 
Huallaga Political-Military Command, reported that 2,200 
"terrorists" who repented have surrendered in the region. They 
have asked for protection under the repentance law. Rodriguez 
added that 1,200 belong to the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement and the rest to the Shining Path. (Lima EL COMERCIO in 
Spanish 27 Jan 94 p A11)

<F P=106> [Dispatch by Randah Habib from Amman] </F>
  [Excerpt] Crown Prince Hasan has led a delegation to 
receive the body of Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 'Umran 
al-Ma'ayitah, which has arrived in Amman aboard a military 
plane, following his assassination in Beirut in front of his 
residence. The coffin, which was wrapped in the Jordanian flag, 
was taken off the plane while the members of Na'ib's family 
shouted: Allahu Akbar [God is great], O martyr of Jordan. 
  Official Jordanian sources have ruled out any personal 
motive 
behind this operation because it was carried out in an organized 
way. The Jordanian officials, who do not see any clear 
explanation for the assassination, noted that it is linked with 
extremist elements, perhaps against the background of Jordan's 
involvement in the peace process. Amman is waiting for the 
results of the ongoing investigations in Lebanon and asked to be 
briefed on the results as details are available. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Beirut, Feb 2 (AFP) - A hitherto unknown Palestinian 
organisation has claimed responsibility for the killing of a 
Jordanian diplomat and warned Norway against hosting any more 
Arab-Israeli peace talks, the pro-Syrian Al-Safir newspaper 
reported on Wednesday. 
  An anonymous caller for the so-called Al-Awja Palestinian 
organisation told Al-Safir that his group was "opposed to the 
establishment of peace with the Zionist enemy (Israel)." 
  "All traitors, wherever they may be, will meet the same fate 
as the Jordanian diplomat," 'Umran Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah who was 
shot dead by a gunman outside his Beirut home on Saturday, the 
caller with a fake Palestinian accent said. 
  He also "threatened strikes on Norwegian interests in the 
Middle East if Palestinian-Zionist meetings continue to be held 
on Norwegian territory," the daily added. 
  For several months Norway hosted secret talks between Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organisation which led to the 
signing in Washington on September 13 of a limited autonomy 
accord. 
  Jordan, which is also engaged in peace talks with Israel 
along with the PLO, Lebanon, and Syria, has blamed opponents of 
the Middle East peace process for Ma'aytah's killing.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Iran and Abu-Nidal Behind the </F>
Assassination. Rivoli Was the First Message. Full Details of 
the Story of the File that Killed al-Ma'ayitah"] 
  [Excerpts] The assassination of the Jordanian diplomat in 
Beirut, Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, has opened the door wide for 
speculation. Our sources assert, however, that there is much 
more to it than meets the eye. 
  Our information indicates that the martyr was not just an 
ordinary employee who had specific duties at our embassy in 
Beirut, and that he had worked there for only nine months, 
indeed a year, as was previously announced. He had performed 
similar duties at our embassy in Cairo. 
  Observers in the know link the assassination to domestic and 
foreign developments that have to do with the peace process and 
Jordan's strained relations with several radical movements, 
specifically allied with the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Interviewed by AL-BILAD, al-Ma'ayitah's relatives told the 
paper al-Ma'ayitah had a very sharp mind. He was a man who 
belonged to his homeland and nation, his brother Najib 
al-Ma'ayitah said. 
  This gives an indication, one of the ministers told us, of 
the nature of the special national tasks performed by the martyr 
in the Lebanese arena. This is especially true since 
al-Ma'ayitah's killers stole a very important file the martyr 
was carrying with him, and not in his briefcase, immediately 
after the assassination. 
  Our sources link this file to problems that arose recently 
between the government and the Islamic Republic of Iran. The 
sources recall His Majesty King Husayn's remarks a month ago 
about considering taking official measures regarding diplomatic 
relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  The sources further say that a Jordanian decision was made 
last Thursday [27 January] according to which the Iranian side 
was told to reduce its diplomatic mission in Amman, which has 33 
people. Our sources say that the security agencies believe most 
of them are Iranian security officers. 
  Active Iranian sources in Amman told AL-BILAD the Jordanian 
ambassador in Tehran was the target of several attacks by 
Iranian groups last month. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry, 
however, chose not to go public about the attacks, although it 
addressed official memorandums to its Iranian counterpart in 
this regard. 
  These sources say that Amman has recently witnessed more 
activities by extremist groups that previously operated in Syria 
and Lebanon and visited Iran. 
  The sources assert that the Jordanian security agencies have 
arrested and interrogated many members of those groups, and that 
some of them are still detained, following the explosion that 
occurred at the Cinema Rivoli in downtown Amman. 
  The security organs had received word about a small bomb 
that 
went off almost a month ago at the same theater. The explosion 
was followed by private calls explaining that it was a 
light-caliber message. Jordanian security services kept a tight 
lid on the second explosion last Wednesday, before locating the 
detonator. [passage omitted] 
  Jordanian Foreign Ministry sources say the Ministry has sent 
a special fact-finding committee to Lebanon to investigate the 
sinful operation and find out who is behind it. 
  Security reports began to link the assassination attempt to 
the group of Abu-Nidal, Sabri al-Banna. Lebanese sources told 
Jordanian security officers that they suspect al-Banna is 
involved in the operation. Consequently, our information says, 
the Jordanian security men left immediately for Lebanon. 
  Lebanese security agencies currently regard the Abu-Nidal 
group as the second suspect in the operation, especially since 
it is rumored that five leaders of the group are jailed in 
Jordan. Our government denies the five are in Jordan, despite 
the fact that it has released some of the movement's cadres 
after being detained for two months. 
  Our informed sources, however, confirm that the Jordanian 
agencies have recently received a thank-you note from Abu-Nidal 
after releasing the movement's sequestered property in Amman, 
which includes documents, offices, furniture, and other items. 
The note also demanded that the movement's five leaders be 
released. The Jordanian Government denies it is holding them. 
  Security sources do not rule out a possible connection 
between Abu-Nidal and the operation. The sources, however, 
think most likely there is a joint operation in which the 
pro-Iran groups drew on Abu-Nidal's experience, since he has a 
rich record of involvement in liquidating Jordanian diplomats 
over the past 10 years. Abu-Nidal is trying to break the tight 
siege imposed by our security agencies on his activities in 
Jordan, since he has repeatedly tried to create a main theater 
of operations in Jordan by contacting figures that cooperated 
with him to use him as a pressure card against the Palestinian 
leadership when the negotiating process faces any impasse. 
  Expressing his movement's domestic crisis in light of the 
negotiating process, Abu-Nidal issued a statement on 29 November 
in which he threatened to take action against the interests of 
Arab regimes. The statement emphasized Jordan, since it is the 
second party, after the Palestinians, that is directly concerned 
with the peace process. 
  The Iranian side, which rejects the negotiating process, has 
incited its subsidiary Islamic and Palestinian movements, 
drawing their attention to the serious Jordanian role in this 
context. This is especially true since Jordan and the PLO have 
signed an agreement and the fact that the Iranians have lost the 
Syrian card, which was also lost by the anti-'Arafat Palestinian 
movements. Those movements are now looking for an objective and 
geographical alternative to Syria to express their rejection of 
the negotiations. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Islamic Jihad in Palestine has issued a 
statement on the intifadah entering its 77th month, in which it 
hails the heroic people of the intifadah, their great 
sacrifices, and their confrontation of the treasonous agreement. 
It praised the Alliance of Palestinian Forces. It said that 
this alliance constitutes a political drive of the large-scale 
massive rejection of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and is solid 
ground for unifying our people in their confrontation of the 
dangers threatening them. 
  The Islamic Jihad statement added: Toppling those who are 
negotiating with the Zionists in the name of our people requires 
an extensive popular action to prove to the whole world that 
this desperate team does not represent our people, and 
therefore, cannot determine their future. This team's 
agreements are not binding on our people. We must all move 
within cohesive national ranks to show the whole world that 
those negotiators only represent themselves and parochial 
interests. 
  The Islamic Jihad in Palestine called on the valiant people 
of the revolution to direct their bullets to the chests of the 
occupiers. 
  On the occasion of the blessed month of Ramadan, the month 
of 
jihad and sacrifices, it said: We call on all the sons of our 
people to strictly adhere to God's teachings, to safeguard the 
sanctity of the blessed month, to abide by the principles of the 
true religion, to carry out more acts of jihad, and to escalate 
the intifadah activities. It declared 6 February a day of 
comprehensive strike and popular indignation all over Palestine.

<F P=106> [By Ahmad Muwaffaq Zaydan in Peshawar] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Armed Islamic Group [AIG] [al-jama'ah 
al-islamiyah al-musallahah] in Algeria has disclosed its 
political, military, and religious objectives, in the first 
press statements since it launched its armed operations in 
November, 1991, in which it claimed responsibility for most of 
the operations in Algeria, including assassinations and advising 
foreigners to leave the country. 
  The head of the political and sharia committee spoke to 
AL-WASAT, having been authorized by "the amir of the jama'ah" 
[the prince of the group] Sayfallah Ja'far about the ideology, 
plans, and relations of the group. He explained that it has 
supporters in 39 out of Algeria's 48 governorates, and that the 
jama'ah is held to be "an extension of the jihad of Shaykh 
Mustafa Buway'ali." He emphasized that the jihad will be 
sustained, since "we do not recognize the secular separation of 
the military and political action." He considered the presence 
of foreigners in his country to be "part of a colonialist 
infidel scheme," who, he said, "represent the throbbing heart of 
every occupation and are spies for the infidel in the land of 
Islam." He criticized the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS]. He 
commended the Afghan jihad, indicating that "we are in their 
debt," noting that many of the Algerians who fought in 
Afghanistan had joined the AIG. 
  It is to be recalled that the AIG recently decided to unite 
the armed groups in Algeria, leaving out the FIS, whose present 
leaders "sold out on the cause." A few days ago, it distributed 
a statement in Peshawar, in which it pointed out that the "unity 
meeting" among the military factions decided to merge their 
groups under the designation of "the Armed Islamic Group." 
These are Abu-'Adlan 'Abd-al-Haqq al-'Ayayidah, Dr. Abu-Ahmad 
and his group, and Abu-'Abd-al-Rahman Sayyid Tarrani and his 
delegation representing Shaykh al-Malyani. Sayfallah Ja'far was 
assigned the leadership. The conferees formed a leading council 
comprising military, sharia, political, and media bodies and 
decided on the following: 
  1. The formulation of a comprehensive, national strategy in 
the area of military operations. 
  2. The formulation of an accurate informational plan to 
surmount the barrier of an internal and external news blackout. 
  3. The organization of the masses to the greatest possible 
effectiveness. 
  4. Streamlining the arms procurement networks and 
instituting new networks. 
  5. Instituting fund raising and spending networks. 
  6. Conducting a survey of the number of martyrs, mujahidin, 
prisoners, with a view to looking after their families and their 
needs. 
  7. Breaking the siege of the central governorates by 
widening the base of operations so as to encompass the entire 
country. 
  8. Keeping track of and killing traitors of the movement 
[al-khawanah al-harakiyin], and sellers (hypocrites and spies). 
  9. Keeping the AIG under control, using sharia laws, and 
spreading the sharia in the ranks of the mujahidin. 
  It is known that a number of the AIG members who fell, or 
those who are still fighting, have participated in the Afghan 
jihad. The AIG issues a weekly publication in Peshawar called 
"AL-ANSAR" although it does not say that it speaks for the AIG. 
It is printed abroad and distributed in Peshawar to Arabs who 
fought in Afghanistan. 
  The following is the text of the interview with AL-WASAT, 
which is the first press interview with one of the AIG leaders, 
who received the AL-WASAT questions in Peshawar and sent them 
abroad to receive answers to them. All this has taken place in 
secrecy for security reasons: 
  [Question] When was the AIG established? 
  [Answer] In previous interviews, we said that the AIG is not 
a newborn, but it has deep roots in the world of Islamic jihad. 
In other words, the AIG is an extension to the jihad of Shaykh 
Mustafa Buway'ali, may God have mercy on his soul. Above all, 
the AIG is an extension to the first major battle which took 
place between the believers and the infidels; namely, the Badr 
Battle, which took place between the prophet, may God's peace 
and blessing be upon him, and the infidels of Quraysh. 
  From an organizational, practical, and combat viewpoint, it 
began in 1989, following the release of Shaykh Mustafa's aides 
from prison, particularly Shaykh al-Malyani, may God have mercy 
on his soul. Contacts then began within the ranks of those who 
believe that jihad is a must when Islam is not implemented, when 
the Muslims' land is usurped, when Muslim women are taken 
captives, or when Muslim men are captured. As we expected, many 
youths have joined Shaykh al-Malyani. Other cells from villages 
and quarters, which were also preparing themselves for armed 
jihad, have also joined Shaykh al-Malyani. In addition to this, 
the youths who fought in Afghanistan have also joined the 
shaykh. This is how the AIG was established. It later issued a 
statement called "the unity statement" in which they explained 
some of the main points of the program of action. 
  Direct military action began on 18 November 1991, 
approximately two years after it was established and after 
recruiting the cadres on which jihad depends pursuant to God's 
order: Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of 
your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into the 
hearts of the enemies of God and your enemies. [koranic verse] 
  Decisionmaking is based on shura and the counselors' 
opinions. This means that the AIG is based on a set of rules 
that are already defined in books of jurisprudence and Islamic 
politics of the pious predecessors, ulema, and reliable imams, 
may God have mercy on their souls. 
  Concerning its military weight, it is responsible for most 
of 
the operations that are carried out in the country, foremost of 
which are assassinations and the deportation of the foreigners, 
crusaders, and Jews. It exists in approximately 39 governorates 
out of the country's 48 governorates. 
  [Question] Was the AIG affected by the Afghan jihad? 
  [Answer] The blessed Afghan jihad has affected many Muslims 
in the whole world. It has many advantages which can only be 
denied by the unjust ones. 
  [Question] Do you believe in change brought about by 
political action, or, to put it concisely, by violence? 
  [Answer] Your question prompts us to raise another important 
question. What do you mean by "political action"? If, by 
political action, you mean joining suspect parliaments and 
alliances, holding dialogue with tyrants, accepting the judgment 
of infidelity rather than Islam, and having recourse to 
international laws, such as the United Nations, the 
International Court of Justice, and other Judeo-Christian 
organizations, then it is the duty of every Muslim to disown and 
repudiate such organizations. The mere thought of having 
recourse to these organizations is against God's orders, let 
alone joining them. 
  If, however, you mean by political action following Islamic 
policy as agreed upon by the ulema of this nation, which 
includes jihad and the promotion of virtue and suppression of 
vice, then this is at the heart of our religion, indeed the peak 
of it. Taking such a course of action is a collective duty, 
which later becomes an individual duty. As for what you term 
violence, this is a misrepresentation of God's words and is 
meant to deceive the people. How can we consider "jihad for the 
cause of God" as violence? Can any Muslim allow himself to say 
this about God's words, unless he is a believer in the laws of 
the East and the West, which serve their own interests? We do 
not recognize the secular separation between military and 
political action. 
  [Question] Why have you attacked foreigners, and what is the 
message you want to deliver? 
  [Answer] We attacked foreigners (Jews, Christians, and 
polytheists) because they are part of an infidel, colonialist 
scheme. They represent a living artery and throbbing heart of 
every occupation, be it external or domestic, explicit or 
implicit. Also, those foreigners are spies for the infidels in 
the Islamic world. In addition, those foreigners represent a 
mainstay of the economy. If they live in peace, then this means 
that the country is leading a normal life. However, killing and 
fighting them is practical evidence of the weakness of the 
infidel regime and the return of Islam as prophesied by the 
prophet, may God's peace be upon him. [passage omitted] 
  [Question] There are reports about Iranian aid and 
facilities from other neighboring states. How true is this? Do 
you receive foreign support and how do you finance your military 
operations? 
  [Answer] Iran is a Shiite state, and so we cannot receive 
aid from it. God Almighty has saved us the trouble. But to God 
belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the 
hypocrites understand not. [Koranic verse] 
  [Question] What are the goals that you aspire to achieve by 
armed action? 
  [Answer] It is a jihad for the cause of God, and not armed 
action. Our only objective is to see God's law prevail, make 
people worship God, end injustice and debauchery, and achieve 
justice as the Koran orders us to do. By doing this, we seek 
only to win God's satisfaction, and nothing else. 
  [Question] What is the nature of your relationship with the 
Salvation Front, and can you ignore it? Suppose a change takes 
place, are you qualified to fill the vacuum in terms of the 
cadres, the army, police, security, etc? 
  [Answer] What front do you mean? There are many fronts, 
many branches, and many spokesmen. Be more specific so that we 
can give you an answer. [passage omitted] 
  [Question] Several names in the Algerian arena adopt 
violence. What are the major groups in terms of strength and 
presence in the arena of military action? 
  [Answer] There is a great clamor regarding this. Those who 
read local and international press believe that the number of 
the armed group exceeds 600 or 1,000 sometimes. This is 
incredible; it is a legendary figure. The objective and purpose 
of this are well-known. The media want to show the world that 
there is conflict in order to frustrate the Muslims and create 
confusion in their ranks. God willing, events will prove that 
certain people only are burdening themselves with the blessed 
jihad. 
  [Question] The Islamic Front has formed an army. Are you 
ready to join it or cooperate with it? 
  [Answer] We would like to ask: Which front are you talking 
about and which army do you mean. Many statements have been 
made regarding this army now that capitulatory peaceful 
solutions have become imminent. The AIG is carrying the banner 
of "There Is No God but Allah" in the battlefield. We have not 
heard about this army nor sensed its reality. He who has 
anything else to say should prove it inside, in the land of fire 
and dust, not in the Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, or Hilton 
Hotels. 
  [Question] If the FIS reaches a compromise with the Algerian 
regime, what will be your response? 
  [Answer] The Mujahidin Shura Council and the Islamic Courts 
will decide what should be done if such a thing takes place. 
  [Question] Do your attacks on Rabeh Kebir and Abdallah Anas 
represent your opposition to them personally or to the FIS? 
  [Answer] We oppose policies, not persons; we oppose actions, 
not faces. In the end, we oppose all those who leave the 
battlefield and escape the tremor. Previous experiments alone 
are not criteria to judge people. The pretext that they 
participated in the fighting in the past but they have abandoned 
it now is not accepted. What counts is the end, not the 
beginning. You can judge all those who are in your mind in 
accordance with this rule. 
  [Question] What is the next strategy of the military action? 
Do you believe that the previous operations or strategy will be 
followed? 
  [Answer] We cannot now define a specific strategy. 
Continuing or changing the strategy depends on many tactical, 
geographical, social, and military factors. Therefore, we 
cannot deal with this now. However, some explorations here and 
there would reveal the features of the coming stage, God willing. 
  [Question] What kind of relationship is there between you 
and 
the military action groups in Egypt and other Arab states? 
  [Answer] It is a relationship that the holy Koran has 
ordered 
us to develop. "But if they seek your aid in religion, it is 
your duty to help them" [Koranic verse]. In the same vein, the 
messenger of God, God's peace and blessings be upon him, says: 
"All Muslims are brothers. They must not fail, disgrace, or 
wrong each other." [passage omitted] 
  [Question] When you select the targets of your military 
operations, do you mean to convey a political message or signal 
beyond the operation itself, or is the objective just to kill 
without intending to convey any signals? 
  [Answer] Targets for military operations are selected in 
implementation of God's words: "And slay them wherever you 
catch them, and turn them out from where they have turned you 
out; for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter." 
[Koranic verse] 
  [Question] A change in any state must cover many and various 
fields, especially in view of the fact that social, political, 
and economic relations are interlinked. Through your action, we 
notice that you focus on the military aspect only. 
  [Answer] Establishing the pillars of the Muslim caliphate 
requires greater efforts by us. We are still at the beginning. 
We have not arrived at the stage that will enable us to think 
of such issues. Now we should stand firmly on the ground. 
Afterward, God will help us go ahead. "And those who strive in 
our cause, we will certainly guide them to our paths; for verily 
God is with those who do right." [Koranic verse] 
  [Question] Any armed movement or revolution needs 
traditional 
leaders or symbols. Do you have such symbols? Are you capable 
of winning such symbols? Who among the Algerian personalities 
would you nominate for leading your action? 
  [Answer] The existence of symbols is not a prerequisite for 
waging jihad. It is favorable and nice to have symbols. But if 
we suppose--and this is the actual situation in Algeria--that 
there is no specific symbol, will jihad cease to exist as a 
duty? This jihad began without outstanding symbols. It began 
with the youth. From the womb of the ordeal, symbols will be 
born, God willing. 
  As for the nomination of leading personalities, certain 
conditions must be observed. In addition to some leadership 
traits that must exist in the symbol, he must have participated 
in jihad and military operations and must have killed a 
considerable number of the enemies of God.

  [Text] Algiers, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Algerian police have 
arrested two Islamic militants in connection with the kidnap and 
murder of Mohammed Bouslimani, the president of the charity 
Al-Islah wa al-Irshad. 
  Bouslimani's body was found a week ago in El Affroun near 
Blida two months after his abduction at the end of November. 
  A police statement said agronomist Guitoun Nasser and imam 
Rashid Zerani, 26, an inspector in Algeria's fraud squad, had 
kidnapped the charity leader on the orders of Djaafar al-Afghani 
leader of the Islamic Armed Group (GIA). 
  It said Al-Afghani had ordered the killing after a series of 
discussions with Bouslimani.

  [Excerpt] Algiers, Jan 31 (AFP)--Unidentified killers 
murdered the national secretary of Algeria's Rally for Culture 
and Democracy (RCD), Rachid Tigziri, early Monday outside his 
home in an eastern suburb of Algiers, family sources said. 
  A cultural association representing Algeria's original 
Berber 
inhabitants, from whom the RCD draws its support, blamed the 
"odious crime" on "terrorists" in a statement. 
  Tigziri was the first national official of a political party 
to be murdered since armed Islamic fundamentalists began waging 
a guerrilla war against the state two years ago. Numerous 
intellectuals have been assassinated as part of a campaign of 
fear. 
  The attackers slit Tigziri's throat as he was heading for 
his 
car outside the building in Bach Djarah, one of the strongholds 
of Islamic fundamentalism in the region around the capital. 
  Formerly a senior civil servant at the Ministry of Labour, 
Tigziri had been economics spokesman for the RCD, led by Said 
Sadi. Tigziri, 42, was married and had no children. [passage

  [Excerpt] Algiers, Feb 2 (AFP) -- Suspected Moslem 
fundamentalists have assassinated an activist in Algeria's 
Attahadi (Challenge) political party, Mohamed Touali, the party 
announced in a statement Wednesday. 
  Touali, 32, was kidnapped overnight Tuesday and his body was 
subsequently discovered, the party said. 
  He was the second member of Attahadi and the fourth 
political 
activist to be slain by suspected Islamic extremists since the 
January 27 murder of another official in the party, Ferhat 
Chibout. 
  The statement did not specify where Touali lived nor where 
the body was found. He was an employee of a state-owned company 
in the eastern town of Constantine. 
  His murder followed the killing Tuesday in the Casbah 
district of Algiers of French journalist Olivier Quemeneur and 
the wounding by gunmen of the cameraman's Australian colleague, 
Scott Allan White. 
  On Wednesday, White was at the Ain Nadja military hospital 
in 
a suburb of the capital, in very serious condition. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Remy Leveau, professor at the Institute of </F>
Political Studies in Paris and expert on the Algerian Army, by 
Farid Aichoune and Henri Guirchoun; date, place not given: 
"Islamic Salvation Front: Army Wants To Negotiate"] 
  [Text] [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Following the failure of 
the National Conference and the appointment of General Zeroual 
as head of the Algerian state, is there deadlock once again? 
  [Leveau] I do not think so. There was a suspicion that a 
secret dialogue has been going on for a long time in the secrecy 
of the El-Boulaida (formerly Blida) military prison. But 
negotiations are now openly being conducted between the army and 
the political elements of the Islamic movement. Moreover, we 
have learned that the officials of the FIS [Islamic Salvation 
Front] at one point went directly from their cells to the 
conference table. That proves that they are recognized as real 
partners. I would even say that the army now seems to regard 
them as the only interlocutors on its level, to the detriment of 
the other political parties. Obviously, what we do not yet know 
is why those negotiations did not succeed. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] After having fought the FIS, does 
this army not now have its back to the wall and have no choice 
but to roll out the red carpet for it? 
  [Leveau] Many officers have probably reached the conclusion 
that it was no longer possible to get rid of the FIS and that it 
will be increasingly difficult for them to develop in a country 
which has been rendered hostile by repression. But from there 
to thinking that the Algerian army is preparing to capitulate in 
mid-campaign.... No, despite two years of a vicious circle of 
guerrilla warfare, terrorism, and repression, the military corps 
has not collapsed, as the Islamic movement may have hoped. It 
has remained completely coherent and united. Furthermore, there 
is a hard core of 25,000 to 30,000 men in the elite troops who 
will remain completely loyal to the general staff whatever 
happens. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Are there not some soldiers who have 
been won over to the Islamic cause? 
  [Leveau] There have in fact been a few desertions at a 
junior level. The army attributes them to mistakes made in the 
days of President Bendjedid, who encouraged the integration of 
students through lengthy periods of military service. But when 
this creeping Islamic fundamentalism led to the desertion of a 
few officers, the punishments were harsh. Military Security 
still exits, and reprisals are apparently taken against the 
families. The message had to be very clearly understood. 
[passage omitted] 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] In the framework of the dialogue 
with the FIS which you mentioned, what can these modernist 
officers have in common with the Islamic fundamentalists? 
  [Leveau] If you make a quick sociological analysis of this 
group of young officers, you discover that they are mainly 
scientists with rational minds. When you look at their 
libraries, you realize that they read both history and science 
fiction. They are often married to teachers. But, at the same 
time, they are very austere people who do not drink alcohol and 
who observe their religion. Some have even gone on pilgrimage 
to Mecca. They are the same age, have followed the same 
educational careers: So their profile is not so far removed 
from that of the so-called second-generation FIS members. 
Furthermore, these officers share a number of nationalist 
values with the Islamic fundamentalists. When the Islamic 
fundamentalists refer to the FLN [National Liberation Front] of 
the war of independence, they adopt the nationalist statements 
of the past, so dear to the military. Moreover, in the future, 
the military and the Islamic fundamentalists may find that they 
have the same line with regard to the Sahara, which is likely to 
become a pretext for upping the stakes and launching a 
confrontation with Morocco with the aim of repairing Algerian 
national unity. 
  [LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR] Even if such a convergence took 
place, would the army's interests be reconcilable with the 
Islamic fundamentalists' political objectives? 
  [Leveau] If it is guaranteed a pact on impunity with regard 
to the corruption scandals in which a number of general officers 
are implicated; if its resources are maintained; and, above all, 
if its administrative autonomy is not affected--the promotion 
scale, recruitment by military academies, housing, pensions--the 
army might ultimately agree to allow the FIS to run the 
country's affairs. 
  This is the hypothesis of a change like the one which took 
place in Chile, in which the army abandoned power without giving 
up its privileges and in which, above all, the democratic 
government agreed not to put Pinochet on trial. In this spirit, 
it is even possible to imagine that the young officers I 
mentioned above might no longer feel complete solidarity with 
their elders and might agree to sacrifice some of them on the 
altar of morality. Provided, of course, the edifice of the army 
in general was not excessively undermined. Also provided that 
the Islamic fundamentalists, for their part, were prepared to 
neutralize their most radical elements. 
  Another, possibly more plausible hypothesis is that of an 
army which played a greater part in a pluralist political 
system. In that case, it would have the position of arbiter 
between the FIS, the moderate Islamic movement, the Republicans, 
the Berbers, and civilian society. That would presuppose the 
FIS agreeing to be limited to a popular role--that of the 
defense of the poor and disinherited. But, in both hypotheses, 
the army would do all it could to maintain its autonomy.

  [Text] Algiers, Feb 7 (AFP)--The radical Armed Islamic 
Group (GIA) has "executed" 70 members from a rival Algerian 
fundamentalist movement, according to a GIA statement appearing 
here on Sunday. 
  In the statement, which has not been authenticated, the GIA 
said it had carried out the executions of members of the Islamic 
Armed Movement (MIA) without giving a precise date. 
  The statement was sent by fax, headed the "State of the 
Islamic Caliphate in Algeria" and dated February 5, 1994. 
  It said the killings had been carried out according to 
Koranic law, adding that the "masters of the political decision 
are the mujahidin." 
  The GIA has accused the MIA of trying to suppress its group 
and has described MIA leader Said Mekhloufi as a "traitor, and 
agent of the government services." 
  In a previous statement the GIA said it was "against all 
truce, all dialogue and all reconciliation with the powers" in 
place and threatened anyone taking part in talks with "the worst 
of deaths." 
  Meanwhile, security forces announced Sunday that 13 armed 
Moslem militants were killed between Tuesday and Thursday in 
several regions of Algeria. 
  Six militants were killed Thursday in Oued Fregha on the 
northern border between Algeria and Tunisia, and two died in 
Mechta El Magahi 450 kilometres (279 miles) southeast of Algiers. 
  Three fundamentalists were killed in Oran in western Algeria 
on Wednesday, and two died Tuesday evening in a suburb of 
Algiers. 
  Earlier Sunday the Hilton hotel in Algiers closed its doors, 
the latest in a growing wave of foreign companies to suspend 
operations here because of continuing fundamentalist violence. 
  The hotel, which opened last August, decided to close for an 
unspecified period six days after the killing in the Casbah 
district of French cameraman Olivier Quemener, whose body was 
repatriated Sunday. 
  It also came three weeks after the assassination of an 
employee of the French consulate, Monique Afri. Both killings 
were blamed officially on Muslim fundamentalist groups.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kamal al-Sa'id Habib, "one of the founders </F>
of the Al-Jihad Organization," by unidentified AL-SAFIR reporter 
in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [AL-SAFIR] Some reports say 
al-Jihad and the Islamic Group might merge. How true is this? 
Were there unification attempts in the past? Why did they fail? 
  [Habib] Al-Jihad will remain al-Jihad, and the Islamic Group 
will remain the Islamic Group. Unification has not been 
proposed because there are major differences in our methods of 
action. Undoubtedly, the Islamic Group is now more prominent 
than al-Jihad, but this is because the two organizations have 
different views. While al-Jihad believes in comprehensive 
change, the Islamic Group believes in the promotion of virtue 
and the suppression of vice. The small operations that gave the 
Islamic Group prominence are part of the group's method of 
action. Al-Jihad, on the other hand, believes in comprehensive 
change as the basis of its movement. Therefore, al-Jihad is now 
weaker than it was in 1981. It lacks organizational foundations 
and has no unified leadership. In addition, it received many 
blows since the assassination of President al-Sadat in 1981. 
  [AL-SAFIR] Do you believe rumors that there is a split in 
al-Jihad between Ayman al-Zawahiri and Colonel Makkawi? 
  [Habib] Colonel Makkawi's story is really strange. I think 
there is an attempt by the media to highlight some names and 
suggest there is a split in the organization. At any rate, 
Ayman al-Zawahiri, Colonel Makkawi, or others represent only 
themselves or small groups within al-Jihad; they do not 
represent the al-Jihad Organization. Within al-Jihad, there are 
many schools of thought that take independent actions; it is 
known that al-Jihad groups work independently. Therefore, I 
believe that the groups representing al-Jihad are too varied to 
be incorporated into one organization. I stress that there is 
no organization for al-Jihad in the full sense of the word; 
there are groups that believe in the general thought but express 
themselves with different mechanisms. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-SAFIR] Is daily violence in the Egyptian streets a way 
to 
achieve power? Does al-Jihad believe that violence is needed at 
this particular stage? 
  [Habib] Violence and clashes with the state will not produce 
positive results; indeed, they will not serve the Islamic 
movement in general. It is better to open up society and try to 
establish the Islamic presence inside its normal structure. The 
strategic outlook should be given precedence over this "din," 
which will not lead to necessary changes. In short, the current 
violence does not benefit al-Jihad or the Islamic movement in 
general. Those in the Islamic movement who practice violence 
are a sector that has been forced by the state to do so. They 
feel their lives are threatened at any moment by military 
courts, even when they live abroad. Therefore, they are 
practicing violence irrespective of its results. We must stress 
that, historically, it was the state that started violence 
against the Islamic groups and counterviolence was thus 
imperative. In addition, the absence of the Islamic shari'ah 
forces Muslims to demand its implementation, even through 
violence. 
  [AL-SAFIR] After each operation, people wonder what the 
Islamists really want. We are posing this question to you. 
  [Habib] It should not be taken for granted that the 
Islamists 
are the ones who are carrying out these operations. Egyptian 
society has been infiltrated and the perpetrators could be the 
Mosad, some armed Christian organizations, or even the state 
itself. We do not want to assume that the Islamists are 
terrorists. Although there are some groups deviating from the 
general course, such as al-Shawqiyun and others, al-Jihad has a 
clear cultural mission. I, therefore, rule out the possibility 
of al-Jihad carrying out such operations. We hope the state 
will implement the Islamic shari'ah so that people can rest. 
[passage omitted] 
  [AL-SAFIR] The government is now calling for national 
dialogue. How do you view this dialogue, knowing that the 
Islamic groups, especially al-Jihad, are not participating? 
  [Habib] The government's call is not serious. I believe the 
president made the call without realizing that there are other 
forces stronger than him. Concerning the mechanism of 
implementation, the call for the dialogue is not serious. If it 
was, then all political forces would have been invited. I think 
al-Jihad and the Islamic Group have conditions for joining the 
dialogue. These include releasing detainees, refraining from 
intervening in Islamic preaching in mosques, and refraining from 
desecrating sanctities. These are simple and legitimate 
demands. Dialogue is needed to end Egypt's crisis, but dialogue 
in its old form is fruitless. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-SAFIR] Where are the political Islam groups heading? 
  [Habib] Those groups need to revise their mechanisms and 
plans to link them to reality. I believe violence will not 
produce results. It will not serve the Islamic movement and 
will not decide the issue. All of society needs a change and 
the outlook toward change must be comprehensive. Islam in Egypt 
will inevitably remain, and when the Islamists reach power there 
will be no struggle among them, as there is in Afghanistan.

<F P=106> [Report by Dina 'Izzat: "The Accused in Attempted </F>
Assassination of Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi Pleaded Innocent on 
Tuesday as Military Trial Entered Second Day"] 
  [Excerpt] Nine Islamist militants, standing military trial 
for last November's abortive attempt on the life of Prime 
Minister 'Atif Sidqi, have rejected all accusations leveled 
against them by the military prosecutor-general, which include 
murder, attempted murder and illegal possession of weapons. Six 
other escaped militants are standing trial in absentia on 
similar charges. 
  As the trial entered its second day Tuesday, the 
presiding-judge read out the indictment sheet which listed the 
charges against the 15 defendants. They were all accused of 
belonging to an illegal group whose target is to overthrow the 
government by force. Three of them were accused of the 
attempted murder of Sidqi, by exploding a booby trapped car near 
his motorcade, and the premeditated killing of a teenage 
schoolgirl, Shayma' Muhammad 'Abd-al-Halim Jawdah. Four others 
are accused of inciting the murder attempts while the remaining 
militants face the lesser charges of illegal possession of 
weapons and forging official papers. 
  "The nine defendants present denied all the accusations 
against them," defence lawyer Muntasir al-Zayyat told AL-AHRAM 
WEEKLY. He said the court also granted the request of the 
defence lawyers to meet with the defendants -- which they had 
been denied for nearly two months -- and another request for 
more time to study the case. Hearings, which first opened last 
Saturday, were adjourned until 5 February. At Saturday's 
opening session, one of the defendants said that although the 
al-Jihad organisation took responsibility for the assassination 
attempt, "all confessions made by the nine (to police 
interrogators) were extracted from them by torture." The 
organisation, in a statement faxed to foreign news 
organisations, said it was responsible for the attempt shortly 
after it was carried out on 25 November last. 
  The nine defendants, standing in an iron cage during 
Saturday's session, seemed in fairly high spirits. They chatted 
with their relatives before the session started. 
  Four volunteer lawyers were present to defend the accused 
militants. One of them expressed pessimism about the expected 
verdicts. 
  Defence lawyer al-Zayyat complained to the court that the 
accused were being ill-treated and forced to make confessions. 
He also said the accused were being kept in solitary 
confinement in cells under poor detention conditions and asked 
the court to order an inquiry into these conditions. 
  One of the defendants interrupted him to complain that the 
medical examiner assigned to verify their claims of torture was 
a woman. "How can we reveal ourselves before a woman?" he asked. 
  Al-Zayyat told the court that military trials will not solve 
the problem of terrorism but may lead to more violence. At 
midday, hearings were interrupted by one of the defendants 
raising his voice to call for the noon prayer. 
  During a subsequent recess, one of the defendants read out a 
statement by al-Jihad: "We wish to remind our fellow Muslims 
that they should not help the government with its plot but 
should boycott the national dialogue ... al-Jihad, led by Ayman 
al-Zawahiri, is opposed to any dialogue with the government and 
will pursue its struggle ... We do not have faith in these 
trials. Judgment is the prerogative of God." 
  Al-Zawahiri, a doctor-turned-Islamist militant leader, is a 
prominent "Arab-Afghan" who fought with the Afghan mojahedin 
against Soviet occupation. He is believed to be in Europe at 
present. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) 
said, in a report issued last weekend, that Islamist militant 
groups bear the "major part of the responsibility" for all acts 
of violence carried out in 1993, while police forces were 
becoming less and less involved in acts of "physical 
liquidation" directed against these groups. 
  The report did not absolve the government of responsibility 
for the spread of religious extremism and fanaticism, however, 
but noted that the state institutions and state-controlled media 
were "retreating" in the face of the pressures brought to bear 
by the "political Islamic tendency." 
  EOHR said it "followed with extreme concern the escalating 
terrorist activity and the acts of violence carried out by some 
armed groups of the political Islamic tendency which 
constituted, in 1993, an unprecedented violation of a 
fundamental human right, which is the right to live." 
  Statistics compiled by the EOHR indicate that "the harvest 
of 
bloody violence" in 1993 included the death of at least 207 
people, more than the total for the previous three years during 
the course of which 139 people were killed in acts of violence. 
  The statistics show that these Islamist groups "bear the 
major part of responsibility for all acts of violence in the 
country, although they had shared this responsibility with the 
police forces in 1992," EOHR said. In 1992, Islamist groups 
killed 39 people while 38 others were killed by police fire. 
  In 1993, however, Islamist groups were responsible for the 
death of 137 people including 90 policemen, 39 innocent 
civilians, 6 Christians and 2 foreign tourists. On the other 
hand, 59 Islamist militants were killed either in clashes with 
police or in suicide missions. Moreover, 11 citizens were 
killed by police fire in the course of clashes between police 
and members of militant Islamist groups. 
  "EOHR, while noting that 59 police victims were killed 
deliberately in acts of physical liquidation carried out by 
these groups, must also note that police have desisted since 
last March from acts of physical liquidation of members of these 
groups," the report said. 
  It said that while 118 people were killed by Islamist 
groups, 
only eight members of these groups were killed by police forces 
when they stormed Al-Rahmah (Mercy) mosque in Aswan last March. 
  The report also noted that Islamist groups have upgraded 
their techniques by using explosive parcels, booby-trapped cars 
and time-bombs placed in public squares and densely-populated 
areas "in order to cause the largest possible number of human 
losses." The year 1993 witnessed 12 major terrorist explosions, 
including nine explosions which aimed to kill indiscriminately. 
  The year also witnessed a sharp escalation in assassination 
plots directed at state officials, the report said, citing 
abortive attempts on the lives of Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi, 
Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif, and Interior Minister 
Hasan al-Alfi, in addition to numerous attacks on police forces. 
In the southern governorate of Asyut alone, 57 policemen were 
killed. Christians and tourists also continued to be terrorist 
targets, the report said. 
  EOHR affirmed its position that the only way to deal with 
this escalation of violence is "the peaceful and courageous 
confrontation of all violations of human rights, regardless of 
their source and the identity of their intended victim." It 
said a police confrontation is not enough, "particularly in view 
of the increasing retreat of the state institutions and media 
before the pressures brought forth by the political Islamic 
tendency, which is bound to encourage religious fanaticism and 
sectarian hatred. 
  "In this connection, EOHR notes that the state institutions 
were giving in to the pressures exercised by Al-Azhar and the 
political Islamic groups to ban numerous literary, intellectual 
and enlightened works under the pretext that they are opposed to 
Islam," the report said. 
  "The organisation also notes that the state is primarily 
responsible for the social phenomenon of religious extremism and 
fanaticism. Educational institutes, state-owned media and 
religious newspapers published by the state or the ruling party 
are playing a role which is as grave as that of the newspapers 
of the political Islamic tendency in preparing society to accept 
and encourage religious fanaticism and sectarian hatred, curtail 
freedom of expression and literary and artistic creativity," the 
report said.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-AHRAM in Arabic on 29 January 
publishes on page 16 an approximately 3,500-word article by 
Islamic scholar Dr. Mustafa Mahmud in which he attacks 
secularists in Egypt as "enemies of religion" and "trumpets of a 
foreign cultural invasion" of the country. 
  The writer maintains that the secularists' chief concern is 
"to confront religion and slander Islamists." The secularists, 
he says, "view terrorists and Islamists of all schools of 
thought as one and the same thing. Categorizing them into 
moderate Islamists, extremist Islamists, and criminal 
terrorists, secularists say, is merely a distribution of roles 
within the same trend, a backward and metaphysical trend hostile 
to civilization." 
  Acknowledging anyone's right to choose his own thinking and 
ideology, the writer contends that no one should go beyond this 
freedom to attack religion and those who believe in it. "Those 
in our country who adopt secularism as their ideology are free 
to do so. If they use the sword of authority or the weapon of 
the media to confront the other side, they will be dragging the 
country to catastrophe. But they will achieve nothing. No 
force, no matter how strong, can sow this bad seed in Egypt's 
soil. Egypt can never suit the growth of this kind of thought; 
it is the land of faith, religion, and prophets." 
  Commenting on the current debate on religion and secularism, 
Mahmud says: "I don't think such debate could have started if 
the stage had not been carefully prepared for it by the horrible 
introduction of the so-called Islamic terrorism." The writer 
adds sarcastically: "And because there is Islamic terrorism, 
the secularist assembly must take the lead and rush to defend 
our society, which is threatened with destruction." 
  The writer then cites a CNN report on CIA financial support 
for Golboddin Hekmatyar, "who runs training camps for over 
10,000 terrorists in Afghanistan," concluding that "Islamic 
terrorism, which suddenly appeared on the scene to upset 
balances in the region, is a creation, premeditated sedition." 
He explains: "After the Islamists triumphed in Afghanistan, it 
became a pressing American interest to divide their ranks and 
create conflict among them to deprive them of the fruits of 
victory and, more importantly, to turn Islamic rule into a 
massacre so that no one would be tempted to establish such 
rule." He adds: "If Hekmatyar is opening scores of camps to 
train over 10,000 terrorists and then send them to particular 
Arab countries for sabotage, this is his second mission. Through 
its agents in Pakistan or any other agent Arab country, the CIA 
will provide him with the millions he needs." 
  The writer states: "If they are sabotaging Egypt and 
distorting its Islam so that it has no Islamic rule, then they 
are mistaken. With the diversified composition of its people and 
its position amid storms, Egypt will not choose `a professional 
Islamist' to rule it. It will always prefer a civilian 
government that respects Islam and preserves its traditions and 
respects Christianity and preserves its values. No Egyptian 
Islamist thinker plans to rule. The Islamists' greatest 
ambition is to create an enlightened and influential Islamic 
public to preserve religion's values and role in the social 
arena." 
  "If they realized this," the writer adds, "they would feel 
at 
ease and let others rest; they would save those squandered 
millions. But, most likely, they have a far-reaching objective: 
Shaking the Islamic creed, breaking its backbone, and removing 
it from hearts. But they, and all the money in the world, can 
never achieve this."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Advice to Italians Here: Caution, </F>
Good Sense"] 
  [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (ANSA) -- European embassies in Cairo 
today urged their nationals to exercise vigilance but avoid 
alarm as a spokesman for the Italian Embassy advised Italians in 
Egypt to be vigilant and apply caution and good sense following 
a warning of attacks on foreigners issued by a radical Islamic 
group. 
  This spokesman said the embassy was not considering 
emergency 
measures "either for the community or for enterprises" as a 
result of the group's threat of "extremely ferocious and strong" 
operations against foreign tourists and investors issued 
Wednesday [2 February] after seven of the Islamic militants were 
killed in a police raid on an apartment in Cairo. "Caution and 
good sense mean not going into areas and quarters which are 
notoriously dangerous, avoiding provocative conduct and 
clothing, and taking account that Ramadan, the Muslim month of 
fasting, is about to begin," said the embassy spokesman to the 
Italian news agency ANSA. 
  Also explained was that checks run on visitors to the 
diplomatic representation installed long ago, following earlier 
threats of this nature, were being kept in place. 
  The president of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Cairo, 
Cesare d'Ippolito, said he had witnessed no panic among Italian 
businessmen, who had all been informed of the statement sent out 
by the Islamic group.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi 
has stated that the recent confrontation with terrorists in the 
al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' area was the result of careful planning and 
reflected the high standard of physical and mental training of 
the members of the police force. It also reflects the high 
standard they achieved in intensive training to deal with such 
crimes in Egyptian society. 
  In statements to newsmen today, the interior minister said 
the security services have much information about the financing 
and recruitment efforts of the terrorists and some misled 
individuals who harm and betray their religion and homeland in 
return for a small sum of money. 
  Answering a question about a REUTER report that some 
terrorists issued a statement threatening to carry out terrorist 
operations, al-Alfi said the Interior Ministry rejects what 
could be called a statement by the terrorist groups, because 
terrorism has no voice, opinion, or aim in Egypt. The ministry 
does not permit criminals to address the Egyptian public as if 
they impose the rule of crime on the millions of honorable 
people in Egypt. 
  The interior minister added: The security services now have 
the initiative and the ability to strike at the terrorists' 
criminal rackets. They will not hesitate to confront and deter 
those who think they can impose their distorted views by force. 
  The minister explained that the police now fully believe 
that 
it is their responsibility to purge the country of the last 
terrorist, irrespective of the sacrifice. 
  Al-Alfi said that any criminal who thinks for one moment 
that 
he can threaten any Egyptian must realize that the security 
services can reach him and punish him for his crimes. It has 
become clear to the public at home and abroad that ugly 
terrorism represents a shallow ideology for people who have 
deviated from the teachings of their religion and loyalty to 
their country. 
  Al-Alfi added that the Interior Ministry announced that it 
will take any terrorist who wants to repent before the honest 
Egyptian courts and that the door will remain open to all those 
who wish to repent and return to the right path to serve the 
interests of their country and people. The ministry can protect 
and assist him provided his repentance is sincere. 
  Al-Alfi said that the Interior Ministry emphasizes that the 
blood of the police and civilian martyrs will not be wasted and 
that any criminal will be punished quickly for any crime he has 
committed. 
  He added that the ministry also thinks that popular support 
for the police has become a strong front for achieving security 
and stability and for promoting development in Egypt. 
  The interior minister affirmed that the security service's 
success in containing terrorism is not the only success they 
seek but a first step to be followed by others, supported by all 
the national forces to impose complete security control. 
  He explained that the ministry's standing instructions to 
the 
police are to confront [words indistinct] shooting with force. 
Al-Alfi said that the Interior Ministry will not be lenient with 
any policeman who fails to use his personal weapon when 
necessary, because the confrontation has become total on the way 
to ending terrorism throughout Egypt.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Feb (MENA)--The Higher State Security 
Court-Emergency today resumed its session of the trial of 
defendants accused of participating in mob events in al-Fayyum. 
The case is trying 48 defendants including Dr. 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman. The court heard the remarks of State Security 
Chief Prosecutor Usamah Qandil on the defense's presentation of 
the case. 
  The court decided to postpone the trial until Tuesday to 
hear 
the comments of the defense on prosecution remarks. 
  Usamah Qandil said the judiciary in Egypt is free and 
independent and that there is no intervention in its work and no 
influence on the judges in trials. 
  He said the defense was interested in defending 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman, who absconded, despite it having no right to 
defend him without paying the same attention to the jailed 
defendants. The defendants have thus become the victims of 
their crimes and their defense. According to Egyptian law, a 
defendant who has absconded cannot be defended in court. 
  He said that 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman was subpoenaed correctly. 
He was subpoenaed to appear before the prosecution, but he 
cannot be subpoenaed in the State of New Jersey, as the defense 
claimed, because it is a very big state, not a small village 
where a person can easily be discovered. 
  Chief Prosecutor Usamah Qandil said the case is not one of 
politics or opinion, as the defense claimed. It is a case of 
defendants who have committed crimes for which the Egyptian 
penal code will punish them. 
  He affirmed that the emergency law is constitutional. He 
said there is no truth in defense remarks that it is 
unconstitutional, especially as the Higher Constitutional Court 
issued a verdict confirming that it was constitutional to apply 
this law. 
  He clarified that the republican decree on declaring a state 
of emergency is a supreme decision. The courts cannot oppose 
it, since it falls within the scope of state action as part of 
its duty to keep social peace. 
  He noted that the defendants in this case can be tried 
before 
the Higher State Security Court-Emergency. He said the State 
Security Courts organized by the law form part of the natural 
judicial system, while the State Security Courts-Emergency were 
formed according to the emergency law. These are extraordinary 
courts linked with the state of emergency. 
  The state security chief prosecutor said that the first 
defendant in the case, Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, practices local 
and international terrorism and continues to incite youths. He 
has misled them and made them join the convoy of destruction and 
sabotage, which moves toward a sea of blood amid the dismembered 
parts of Muslim and non-Muslim victims. 
  He noted that there is no text in the Constitution the 
articles of which contradict the process of approving the 
rulings of the Higher State Security Court-Emergency. He 
clarified that when the law stipulated approval of the rulings, 
it defined the limits for the signing authority according to its 
speciality. It stipulated that before approval, the rulings 
must be reviewed by the approval office, which consists of 
judges who review the rulings before approving them. 
  The representative of the prosecution concluded his comment 
by asking for the maximum sentence for the defendants. He noted 
in this regard that the crimes they have been accused of have 
been confirmed by the prosecution's eyewitnesses and 
investigation.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 3 (AFP)--Three of the seven Islamic 
militants killed in a police raid in Cairo were involved in the 
murder of a British tourist in October 1992, police said 
Thursday. 
  Police said the three shot dead on Wednesday--Yasir Zaki, 
'Abd-al-Nabi Tayih and Tariq al-Qurayshi--took part in the 
murder of 28-year-old Sharon Hill in the town of Dayrut, 300 
kilometers (180 miles) south of Cairo. 
  Two other British tourists were wounded in the attack. Hill 
was the first foreigner to be killed in a campaign of violence 
launched by fundamentalist militants in March 1992. 
  Western embassies in Cairo said Thursday they were taking 
seriously the threats against foreigners issued by the outlawed 
Islamic militant group al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah following the 
police raid. 
  However, the embassies stressed they were not warning their 
nationals against visiting Egypt. 
  On Wednesday, the militant group warned foreign investors 
and 
tourists to leave the country, saying it would retaliate against 
the "massacre" of seven of its members by police, and its next 
attacks would be "extremely tough." 
  The interior ministry said police shot dead the seven 
militants when they came under fire in a raid on an apartment in 
a poor district of Cairo. 
  They discovered a large quantity of arms, explosives and 
remote control devices in the apartment. None of the policemen 
was hurt. 
  Seven foreigners were among the 293 people killed since the 
militants launched their campaign aimed at toppling the secular 
government of President Husni Mubarak. 
  Two were killed in an attack on a coffee shop in Cairo in 
February 1993. Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack, 
which remained unresolved. 
  Four other foreigners were killed when a gunman opened fire 
last October in the Semiramis Hotel in Cairo. Police said the 
gunman, arrested on the spot, was mentally ill. 
  Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi warned Wednesday that the 
security forces would continue the crackdown against Islamic 
militants "until the last terrorist is eliminated."

<F P=106> [Spelling of all Iranian names as received] </F>
  [Text] Tehran, Jan 31 (AFP) -- The murder of an Iranian 
pastor, Hayk Hovsepian, whose body was recovered recently, was 
connected with the religious activities of the small Protestant 
sect he led, Hovsepian's relatives told AFP Monday [31 January]. 
  One member of the victim's family, requesting anonymity, 
said 
the leader of the "Assembly of God" had felt he was "in danger 
since he brought to the world's attention in January the case of 
fellow Assembly of God pastor Mehdi Dibaj, originally a Moslem, 
who was sentenced to death for having converted." 
  Hovsepian disappeared on January 19 while he was travelling 
by car to Tehran airport. 
  Police photographs of his body, shown to the family, 
indicated wounds to the abdomen and chest. 
  The body was found the following day in a street in the 
Eslamabad area, some 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of Tehran. 
  However, the family said they were not informed of 
Hovsepian's death until Sunday, and they were unable to see the 
body, because it was buried unusually quickly at Tehran's huge 
Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery. 
  On Monday they were granted permission to bury the body with 
a religious ceremony at a Protestant cemetery. 
  No official account was given to the family about the 
circumstances of Hovsepian's death, the authorities saying 
simply that an investigation was in progress. 
  Another relative who requested anonymity said Hovsepian "had 
no enemies -- the only problem was that he led the Assembly of 
God." 
  "Our church is very active in trying to spread the message 
of 
the Bible, and the government asked us to stop propagating our 
religion," the relative said, adding that the authorities 
recently closed several of the Protestant sect's places of 
worship, after it refused to stop spreading the faith. 
  The sect says it has some 3,000 members in Iran. 
  Several of its members told AFP that the Assembly of God 
followers had been subjected to "pressure and intimidation" from 
the authorities throughout Iran in recent months. 
  Relatives said Hovsepian's death was connected with his 
campaign to alert the world community to the case of Mehdi 
Dibaj, detained for nine years and recently sentenced to death, 
according to the Assembly of God, for having converted to 
Christianity. 
  Dibaj was freed on bail on January 15 following 
international 
pressure, particularly from the Vatican and other European 
countries, including France. 
  The Iranian authorities denied that Dibaj had been sentenced 
to death, and said he was simply accused of "offences against 
the Moslem Prophet (Muhammad) and Imam (Ayatollah) Khomeyni," 
founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

  [Excerpt] Three Israelis were wounded by terrorist gunfire 
in Halhul a short while ago. One of them is in critical 
condition and the other two in moderate condition. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports that as a Subaru passed the 
three men's car at the entrance to Halhul from the direction of 
Hebron, some 20 bullets were fired from it. A leaflet signed by 
the 'Izz al-Din al-Qassam squad was found on the site. The 
Subaru was later found abandoned in Hebron. The security forces 
have clamped a curfew on the area. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, Feb 3 (AFP) -- Israeli 
soldiers disguised as Arabs shot dead a leader of the armed wing 
of the PLO's main group Fatah on Thursday in the occupied Gaza 
Strip, Palestinian sources said. 
  The troops, including women soldiers, opened fire from two 
cars at a group of Fatah Hawks sitting on the road in the Rafah 
refugee camp. Salim Muwafi, the Hawks leader for the camp, was 
killed and another Palestinian wounded. 
  The Hawks fired back, wounding two members of the army's 
undercover unit, the sources said. The army sent in 
reinforcements and imposed a curfew as explosions were heard in 
the camp. 
  The armed wing of Fatah agreed to a ceasefire after the 
Israeli-PLO autonomy accord was signed on September 13. 
  But dissidents took up arms again after the army shot dead a 
leading Hawk, Ahmad Abu-Rish, in November shortly after he had 
been pardoned. The dissidents said earlier this week they had 
mounted seven anti-Israeli operations. 
  Muwafi was the 1,173rd Palestinian killed by Israeli gunfire 
in the six years of the intifada against Israel's rule of Gaza 
and the West Bank, according to an AFP toll.

<F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Interior Minister Salameh Hammad on Sunday 
announced that two people had confessed to planting the 
explosive devices that went off in two cinema theatres and said 
there was a broader plot to destabilise Jordan through 
subversion. 
  The minister's comments, carried by the Jordan News Agency, 
Petra, indicated that the two suspects could be linked to an 
underground group called "Jaysh Muhammad" (Muhammad's Army) 
comprised mostly of Jordanians who returned home after fighting 
the 1980-90 Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. 
  Mr. Hammad said the two, Muhammad 'Ali Shihadah, 26, a 
construction material salesman, and 'Id Salih al-Jahalin, 31, a 
plumber, had admitted to planting the explosive devices at 
Amman's Rivoli theatre on January 26 and al-Zarqa's Salwa 
theatre on February 1. 
  The two blasts injured at least seven people, including Mr. 
al-Jahalin who suffered serious wounds to the lower part of his 
body at the al-Zarqa' explosion. 
  The nature of Mr. al-Jahalin's injuries were such as they 
could have been sustained only from a position of close 
proximity, possibly while handling the explosive device which 
went off prematurely, sources said. As such, they said, he was 
an immediate suspect after his removal to hospital and details 
he provided upon interrogation led to other arrests. 
  First reports spoke of five people arrested last Wednesday, 
one day after the al-Zarqa' blast. More detentions were 
reported shortly thereafter. 
  Mr. Shihadah and Mr. al-Jahalin also admitted to have been 
behind another bomb which was safely removed at al-'Akrush 
Supermarket at Safut, northwest of Amman, last year. 
  "The criminals have confessed that they carried out these 
attacks," Mr. Hammad said, paying tribute to the "strenuous and 
relentless efforts of the Public Security Department" for the 
arrest of the suspects. 
  The suspects "are part of a group which will be disclosed 
later," the minister said. "They have links with some people 
who have returned from Afghanistan." 
  "Investigations are continuing to uncover other details and 
plots aimed at harming national security and stability," he 
added. 
  The two bombings at the two theatres known for screening 
X-rated movies, coupled with the discovery of the device planted 
at the Safut supermarket which sells alcohol, had immediately 
made religious extremists prime suspects. 
  The nature of the bombs, described as crude, homemade 
devices 
consisting of acetone peroxide, were the same as the type used 
by members of Jaysh Muhammad in some attacks in 1991. The 
bombmaking technique was believed to have been acquired by Jaysh 
Muhammad members during their fight alongside the Afghan 
Mujahedeen. 
  Most of the group's members are believed to be Jordanian 
volunteers who fought with the Afghan rebels and returned home 
after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1990. 
  Eighteen members of the group were found guilty in 1992 of 
carrying out or plotting attacks against senior government and 
security officials, state buildings and foreign diplomats as 
well as liquor stores and night clubs. 
  Eight of them including two in absentia, were sentenced to 
death. The death sentences, except those on the two at large, 
were commuted to life terms by His Majesty King Husayn. 
  Jaysh Muhammad was at one point reported to be the "military 
wing" of the Muslim Brotherhood, but the Brotherhood strongly 
denied any such link with the group. 
  According to experts on the Islamic movement in Jordan, 
Jaysh 
Muhammad was set up by hardliners who were once members of the 
Brotherhood but who quit the group after being disillusioned 
over what they saw as the leadership's moderate approach and 
confining the group to the mainstream political process in 
Jordan. 
  Some of the so-called Arab-Afghan veterans--Arab volunteers 
who fought in Afghanistan--remain in Pakistan as well as 
Afghanistan and are suspected of directing militancy in Algeria 
and Egypt.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report from Shandi in Sudan's Northern Region] </F>
  [Text] In a new development the Sudanese Government has 
opened new camps for Arab terrorists in al-Hassaniyah south of 
Shandi, a mountainous area with difficult terrain. The 
government dug several wells, reclaimed 5,000 feddans of land, 
and set up a number of farms to ensure provisions for the 
"Yarmuk," "al-Hudaybiyah," and "al-Qadisiyah" camps, where 
Egyptian, Algerian, Tunisian, and Palestinian terrorists will be 
trained in addition to some Asian and African nationals. 
  Dr. Usamah Bin-Ladin, who is wanted by the law in several 
Arab countries, is helping the Sudanese Government to finance 
these camps. Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir issued a 
decree--which was published by the newspaper AL-INQADH on 
Wednesday, 5 January--granting 1,550 square meters of 
residential land to Bin-Ladin's al-Hijrah Company to build its 
headquarters on. 
  Al-Bashir's decree also transferred the ownership of 
"al-Mukabarat" agricultural project in the Northern region to 
Bin-Ladin. Agricultural produce from the project's 20,000 
feddans will be used to supply the terrorist camps. These camps 
are being opened in the Northern Region in the wake of the 
amendment of the Sudanese Citizenship Law.

<F P=106> [All Sudanese place-names as published] </F>
  [Text] Some Arab and Western capitals are following with 
great interest the trend within the Sudanese Government to grant 
Sudanese citizenship to any Muslim, since this is considered a 
first of its kind by a government since the naturalization law 
was created. 
  Diplomatic sources in Cairo noted that the Khartoum 
government intends to pass a new draft law on naturalization. 
This law stipulates granting Sudanese citizenship to every 
Muslim this coming month. The sources added that if this 
happens, large numbers of extremist terrorists will find shelter 
and a land to use as a springboard for their terrorist 
activities. 
  It is worth noting here that the current naturalization law 
stipulates that the applicant for citizenship must have resided 
in Sudan for not less than 12 years and should not have a 
criminal record of a crime that violates security and honor. 
  These diplomatic sources noted that there are more than 
5,000 
men and women extremist Muslims residing in Sudan. Most of them 
are from Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Palestine. 
The number of Islamists from Morocco known to these sources is 
50. There are over 370 Egyptians known by their "code" 
[preceding word in English] names. There are also over 300 
Tunisians who belong to the Ennahda Movement headed by Rachid 
Ghanouchi. 
  These sources noted that among these groups, there are some 
Syrians, Iraqis, and Yemenis who live in Sudan under the cover 
of being businessmen and contractors. Most of these Islamists 
live in the areas of al-Riyad, al-Ta'if, al-Manshiyah, Kawbar, 
and Madinat al-Mughtaribin in Madinat al-Khartoum Bahri.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 Feb (MENA)--A statement by Sudan's al-Ummah 
opposition party has accused armed elements of the Sudanese 
National Front of attacking prayers during Friday prayers at 
Ansar al-Sunnah Mosque in Omdurman yesterday. [see item 
EA0402195294 in previous Terrorism Report] The statement 
described the incident as a massacre planned and carried out by 
the National Front, leaving 28 worshipers dead [number as 
received], including four students, and more than 300 others 
wounded. The statement added that the incident coincided with 
similar organized attacks on other mosques affiliated with the 
Ansar al-Sunnah in Abu Sa'd and Zaqalona. 
  The statement denounced the incident and noted that this 
bloody attack exposes the front and its claims that it is 
defending Islam as well as its so-called cultural plan.

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 1 (AFP) -- The authorities in Yemen have 
told tribesmen holding three French tourists hostage for more 
than a week to free them "immediately" in exchange for pledge to 
look into demands for a road into the tribesmen's remote 
mountain fief. 
  Reliable Yemeni sources said the government had given the 
promise in a letter signed by 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-'Ansi, deputy 
prime minister and general secretary of the Islamic 
fundamentalist Al-Islah party and by fellow deputy prime 
minister Mujahid Abu-Shawarib. 
  Abu-Shawarib is himself a native of the region where the 
three French tourists are being held about 200 kilometers (120 
miles) northwest of Sanaa. 
  The letter was due to be delivered late on Monday to the 
mountain village of Al-Madhan more than eight hours by road and 
trail from the capital. 
  The move follows a decision announced on Sunday by the 
al-Hashid tribe whose territory adjoins Al-Madhan to halt 
supplies of food to the rebel village in order to force the 
kidnappers into surrendering. 
  The men who seized the French tourists belong to the smaller 
Ahnum tribe who claim to be penalised because the only road to 
their enclave goes through al-Hashid territory with the result 
that often their farm produce is confiscated. 
  A road to be built in the region was initially due to go 
through Ahnum territory but was later diverted to go through 
al-Hashid land. 
  A report in the English-language YEMEN TIMES Monday said the 
ministry of public works had come under strong pressure from the 
al-Hashid tribal chief Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar who 
is also president of parliament to re-route the road so as to 
skirt the Ahnum enclave. 
  The letter delivered Monday reportedly said "the path of the 
road will be reexamined if the French hostages are released." 
  Henri Haslot and his wife, both retired agronomy teachers in 
their seventies, and 42-year-old Brigitte Fontaine were 
kidnapped at gunpoint on January 23 as they were travelling on 
the road from Sa'dah in the extreme north of Yemen. 
  A French foreign ministry spokesman Monday said the three 
were "well treated and in good health." 
  The YEMEN TIMES showed a photograph of the three French 
tourists sitting smiling with a village man at their side. 
  The paper said there had been at least 11 similar cases in 
the past three years, and that all of them had come to a 
negotiated settlement. 
  It said several countries had advised their nationals not to 
go to Yemen unless it was absolutely necessary.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Feb (MENA)--Yemeni Prime Minister Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has revealed wide differences among the 
parties competing for authority in his country. He accused the 
political powers involved in the ruling process of adopting a 
harsh, centralized, and backward approach to running the 
country's affairs. He said this confirms that there is no desire 
to unify institutions, but rather to maintain the status quo. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM to be published on 2 February, 
al-'Attas said he rejected an offer by Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih to join the General People's Congress to avoid 
further division within the Yemeni Socialist Party. 
  Al-'Attas affirmed that there are military movements in the 
two sections of Yemen, particularly after the suspension of all 
projects to rebuild, restructure, and unite the Armed Forces 
since the declaration of unity on 22 May. 
  The Yemeni prime minister accused the state of collaborating 
with terrorists to strike at rival political forces in the local 
arena. He noted that the terrorist elements in Yemen are being 
used in operations at home and abroad. 
  Asked when he would return to Sanaa, al-'Attas said: Soon, 
once we reach full agreement on the security arrangements and 
the legal and constitutional guarantees that aim to rearrange 
affairs and establish peace and stability in Yemen.

  [Text] Moscow February 3 TASS -- Operational headquarters 
has been formed in Yakutsk, capital of Russia's northeast 
Siberian autonomy, to deal with emergencies, including acts of 
terror, the press service of the Federal Ministry for 
Emergencies told ITAR-TASS on Thursday. 
  The headquarters will include members of the Federal 
Interior 
Ministry, the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service, the Federal 
Prosecutor's Office and the Federal Committee for Emergencies, 
as well as Moscow officials. 
  As is known, terrorists from the Vozmezdie (Retribution) 
group have demanded that the Yakutsk authorites hand over to 
them US$500,000 and 500 million rubles at Yakutsk Airport on 
February 4. The terrorists threaten to explode the city's life 
supporting installations if their demand is not met. 
  Experts of the Russian Interior Ministry believe that the 
threat of the explosion is no more than a bluff since the 
criminals need only money. Moreover, competent bodies together 
with army specialists are carrying out operational measures to 
locate and defuse any possible explosive devices. 
  The Trans-Baikal regional centre of the Federal Ministry for 
Emergencies has been put on red alert. Rescue teams are on 
board an aircraft at a Moscow airport, ready to take off for 
Yakutsk any time.

  [Text] Moscow February 4 TASS -- The Siberian city of 
Yakutsk is heavily guarded on Friday as an ultimatum to explode 
its major infrastructure facilites received from an unknown 
terrorist group expires. 
  A group called "Retribution," of which nobody had ever heard 
in Yakutsk, demanded to be paid US$500,000 and 500 million 
rubles threatening to explode life-supporting facilities of the 
city. 
  The Russian Interior Ministry told TASS that police in 
Yakutsk believe the threat is just a bluff; however, army 
experts joined police in a search for explosives. Special 
headquarters were created to monitor the situation and 
reinforced police units are patrolling the city. 
  Everything was quiet in Yakutsk as for 1800 hours local 
time, 
Mayor Aleksey Tomtosov told TASS by telephone adding that all 
important objects are heavily guarded.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Andreyev, Arkadiy Zheludkov, and Valeriy </F>
Yakov: "Terrorists Maintain Tension in Yakutsk, While the 
Authorities Play at Secrecy"] 
  [Text] For three days now the editorial office's 
correspondents have been trying to find out the details of the 
case of the "Retribution" terrorist group which has demanded 500 
million rubles [R] and $500,000 from the government of the 
Republic of Sakha-Yakutia, threatening to blow up vitally 
important facilities in Yakutsk. 
  After the republic Prosecutor's Office instituted criminal 
proceedings in connection with the threats, we contacted Nikolay 
Valentinskiy, deputy prosecutor of Sakha-Yakutia. According to 
our interlocutor, the inhabitants and the law-enforcement organs 
learned of the critical situation in the city from reports in 
the central media. 
  There is no panic in Yakutsk, he said. All enterprises, 
including schools, are functioning normally. N. Valentinskiy 
did not confirm, but nor did he deny the editorial office's 
information that a description had been obtained of one of the 
terrorists, who brought an audiocassette to the mayor's office 
with the "Retribution" group's demands on it. N. Valentinskiy 
refused to supply any other details of the incident, citing the 
ban on providing the press with information until the inquiry 
has been completed. 
  We were unable to obtain any more information from the 
republic Security Ministry office. According to the minister's 
aide, the law-enforcement organs are operating in accordance 
with a special plan. The criminals have not contacted them 
again. There has been no agreement so far on the place or time 
of a meeting. 
  Vladimir Fedyunin, Sakha-Yakutia first deputy minister of 
internal affairs, was more definite. "It is total rubbish," he 
said in connection with the description of the terrorist. V. 
Fedyunin refused to say any more to IZVESTIYA, on the assumption 
that there might be calls from the terrorists' accomplices. 
  Confidential sources reported that information on the 
willingness to make a payment was broadcast on Yakutsk 
television Channel 12 at the appointed hour on 3 February. The 
money was to be collected by someone in a Moskvich car after a 
signal had been given on television. There was no agreement, 
nor could there have been any agreement on the place where the 
money was to be handed over--our correspondent was citing 
private conversations with republic Internal Affairs Minister 
Valeriy Fedorov and General Prosecutor Vasiliy Kolmogorov. 
  Local law-enforcement organs checked on potential hoaxers 
suspected of similar threats in the past, but they obtained no 
information on the terrorists. According to the law-enforcement 
organs' current data, there have been no reports of any 
"Retribution" terrorist group. 
  There was an earlier occasion, in 1993, when an unidentified 
citizen also called the local authorities and threatened to blow 
up power facilities in Yakutsk unless he received some money. 
It turned out to be a hoax. 
  We were told at the Russian Ministry for Emergencies that an 
aircraft carrying a rescue team and the necessary equipment and 
medicines had been prepared in connection with the situation in 
Yakutsk, in case of unforeseen developments.

  [Text] Moscow February 7 TASS -- The terrorist who 
threatened to explode the key life-supporting installations in 
the city of Yakutsk, north-eastern Siberia, was arrested on 
Sunday. Yakutsk Mayor Aleksey Tomtosov told ITAR-TASS by 
telephone on Monday morning that the terrorist was a certain 
Abdulayev, who had been earlier convicted three times. 
  On February 4 he demanded that the republic's government 
deliver US$500,000 and 500 million rubles or else he would set 
off several explosions and commit several other acts of terror 
in Yakutsk. 
  It was soon found out that Abdulayev had planted no bombs. 
It was also established that no group Vozmezdie (Retribution) 
existed: it was an invention of the hardened criminal who wanted 
money to pay off major debts and "enjoy some good living," as he 
put it himself. Aleksey Tomtosov said criminal proceedings had 
been instituted. Specialists of the Federal Ministry of Internal 
Affairs and Counter-Intelligence Service supposed from the very 
beginning that the criminal was bluffing, but a large-scale 
operation was launched to make sure that no danger threatens the 
city and its residents.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Telegin </F>
of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Ministry of Security and 
interview with Yakutsk Mayor Aleksey Tomtosov by Ruslan Ignatyev 
under the "Incident Press" rubric; place, date not given: 
"Money Was To Have Been Handed Over at Airport" -- first two 
paragraphs are introduction] 
  [Text] As ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA reported yesterday, on the 
morning of 1 February a cassette tape arrived in the lobby of 
Yakutsk City Hall. On this tape there was a recording of a 
payment demand for $500,000 and 500 million rubles. If these 
terms were not met, the terrorists threatened to detonate 
explosions at important vital installations. 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's special correspondent called the 
Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) Ministry of Security and asked the 
officer on duty, Lieutenant Colonel Sergey Telegin, to spell out 
the details of what had occurred. 
  [Ignatyev] Sergey Vladimirovich, how did all this begin? 
  [Telegin] At 0900 hours on 1 February, an unidentified 
person dropped a cassette tape off in the lobby of city hall and 
asked Tamara, the secretary, to give it to her superiors. The 
cassete lay around in the lobby nearly all day, and it was only 
toward the evening that someone remembered that it was there. 
When the tape was played, an unusual 10-minute recording was 
discovered on it. 
  A calm male voice announced that a terrorist group named 
"Revenge" is operating in Yakutsk; it has the capability to 
carry out sabotage and terrorist acts, blow up vital 
installations in the city -- namely heat supply stations, 
gasworks, and water supply systems -- and also perform acts of 
violence against the civilian population on bus routes and in 
airport waiting halls if the authorities do not meet the 
relevant conditions. The conditions are these: On 4 February 
the authorities must hand over $500,000 and 500 million rubles. 
  The extortioners proposed the following plan of action: At 
1900 hours local time on 3 February, there should be an 
announcement on the 12th channel of Yakutsk television in which, 
if the conditions had been accepted, a contact telephone number 
should be indicated for communication purposes. 
  The terrorists named a vehicle -- a Moskvich station wagon 
-- 
together with its registration number. According to the 
criminals' information, it is a private vehicle that carries 
paying passengers. The money must be handed to the driver. 
Between 1000 and 2100 hours on 4 February he has to drive 
around the city picking up anyone who hails him and asks to be 
taken to the airport. Every 50-60 minutes the driver has to 
turn up at the cabstand at the airport. The driver must not be 
replaced by an officer. The capture of the person arriving to 
collect the money would also result in serious consequences: 
The terrorists would open fire indiscriminately on people 
outside and in the airport waiting hall. 
  A pack of "Rodopi" cigarettes is to be fixed to the 
windscreen of the "Moskvich" to identify it. The voice warned 
the driver not to touch it, it was none of his business. 
  [Ignatyev] What action did you take to prevent a tragedy? 
  [Telegin] As soon as the chief heard about the message, an 
operational staff was set up with the participation of 
representatives of the Internal Affairs Ministry, Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, prosecutor's office, and Committee 
for Civil Defense and Emergencies. We put extra guards on all 
important installations in the city. There was a joint session 
of this staff and the government of the Republic of Sakha 
(Yakutia). The terrorists' conditions were accepted. We found 
the driver indicated by the criminals and handed him the money. 
The contact telephone number was read out on local television 
channel 12. An operation was carried out to search for and 
disable potential explosive devices. None has been found so 
far. The relevant services are ready at any time to take all 
the necessary steps to prevent a tragedy. The Transbaykal 
regional center of the Russian Federation Emergencies Ministry 
has been placed on red alert. A special team will come from 
Moscow to assist if necessary. 
  A ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA special correspondent asked mayor of 
Yakutsk, Aleksey Tomtosov, about the situation in the city. 
  [Tomtosov] All is quiet in the city at this time, all 
institutions and enterprises are operating. It is probably an 
unsuccessful hoax. I hope there will be no explosions or 
terrorist acts. The criminals are just after the money. 
Nonetheless, it is not nice when these situations occur. We 
have tighter supervision at heating plants and other vital 
installations, since the winter has been unusually severe this 
time round. As I talk with you, the temperature is -41 outside. 
The Arctic winter has ended and the days are considerably 
longer. We are looking forward to some warmth. And we are 
hoping for better things. 
  STOP PRESS: As is known, the terrorists set a deadline for 
the receipt of the money -- 2100 hours local time. That is 1500 
hours in Moscow. We telephoned the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) 
Security Ministry duty officer and he said that none of the 
bandits had arrived to collect the money. It had been decided 
to extend the operation until around 2300 hours local time. 
  The Yakutsk prosecutor's office has instituted criminal 
proceedings for extortion.

<F P=106> [Sergey Bystrov report: "`Savior of Siberia' Lands Up </F>
Behind Bars"] 
  [Text] As the editorial office has been informed by the 
Russian General Prosecutor's Office Information and Public 
Relations Center, the Irkutsk Oblast Prosecutor's Office, acting 
in conjunction with the East Siberian Regional Administration 
for Combating Organized Crime, has halted the activity of a 
dangerous group whose aim was to perpetrate armed terror against 
entrepreneurs, law enforcement agency chiefs, and the heads of 
city and oblast administrations. 
  This formation hid behind a "front"--a private legal 
practice 
called Partner LTD, which was supposedly intended to give legal 
assistance to the population regarding the privatization of 
state property. 
  In fact a well organized, cohesive gang was set up complete 
with its own operations administration, security service, 
special department, and skillfully camouflaged bases in 
neighboring woods, where they stored arms and munitions, 
interrogated citizens with the use of physical violence, worked 
out kidnapping plans, and trained gang members in the use of 
guns and knives and in unarmed combat. 
  The general director of Partner LTD, who styled himself the 
"savior of Siberia" and his gang the "Movement for the Recovery 
of the Siberian Nation," committed with his partners in crime 
the murder of two entrepreneurs in the city of Shelekhov, 
Irkutsk Oblast, and was preparing to commit other acts of terror. 
  The uninvited "savior of Siberia" and 13 members of his gang 
were arrested as a a result of measures taken by investigations 
operatives. All have had charges pressed against them. Another 
three gunmen are being sought. 
  During the operation to eliminate the gang 4 assault rifles, 
14 sawed-off guns, 11 sporting shotguns, around 40 grenades, 
hundreds of kilograms of napalm, 12 radio sets, a large number 
of sets of militia uniforms, camouflage clothing, and other 
military equipment and munitions were seized at storage sites. 
  The case is being investigated by an Irkutsk Oblast 
Prosecutor's Office investigation operations group. The 
investigation is constantly monitored by the Russian General 
Prosecutor's office.

<F P=106> [Tunzale Kasumova report: "Cars Blown to Smithereens"] </F>
  [Text] Baku -- Train No. 660, which was standing at a 
platform in Baku Railroad Station, was blown up at 2247 hours 
yesterday. Three people died, and seven were injured. 
  If the explosion had happened some 20 minutes earlier or 
later, the scale of the tragedy would have been more 
considerable. By a lucky chance, however, by the time the 
delayed-action mine placed in the second car went off, the 
passengers who had just arrived on this train from Kislovodsk 
had already gotten off and all those who were to set out in it 
for Astara at 2307 hours had not yet had time to get on. 
Nevertheless, material damage (considerable damage!) was 
caused: In addition to the two cars blown to smithereens, 
windows were blown out in the nearby Baku-Tbilisi and Baku-Ganja 
trains. 
  A. Bagirov, the republic's transport prosecutor, has said 
that an investigation has started. "This is not the first act 
of terrorism," he remarked. "Whereas in previous instances we 
were dealing with explosive devices with a clockwork mechanism 
restricting their operating time to 12 hours, a mine has now 
been used which, thanks to special chemical fillers, can be set 
off two or three days after being put in position."

  [Text] The operation for the release of the hostages taken 
by a terrorist in Sukhodolsk on Thursday (formerly Krasnodon, 
the Ukrainian region of Lugansk) has practically come to an end 
in the airport in Rostov-on-Don. Well-informed sources told 
INTERFAX that the terrorist, who called himself Nikolay 
Skvortsov, was seized. 
  He had kept two boys, ages 3 and 4, and their 28-year-old 
nursery school teacher, Natalia Khitalenko, as hostages. 
  The terrorist, who had also captured a YAZ car with a 
driver, 
demanded on Thursday morning that US$500,000 and a plane to go 
abroad be given to him. 
  He went from Sukhodolsk to Rostov-on-Don together with the 
hostages. Authorities there agreed to give him a Tu-134 
aircraft. 
  Initially, he declared that negotiations would begin as soon 
as he boarded the plane. He also demanded that he and the 
hostages board the plane before the crew. Two crews had 
volunteered to pilot the plane. 
  According to some sources, the terrorist intended to leave 
for London. Other information says he was going to the U.S.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Right-Wing Extremists"] </F>
  [Text] More than 70 neo-Nazi and right-wing extremist 
organizations and splinter groups with a total of about 41,500 
members are haunting Germany. While so far authorities have 
assumed that the right-wing extremist scene is largely torn by 
strife, now constitutional protectors admit that they have 
underestimated the interlacement of the groups. 
  The slogan of "Marching separately, striking together," 
which 
was issued by the late neo-Nazi leader Michael Kuehnen, is 
increasingly being followed. Controlled by the supra-regional 
cadre organization "New Front Association of Like-Minded 
People," individual groups at home and abroad are coordinating 
their activities through magazines, information telephones, and 
mailbox systems. 
  The militant nature of the scene is also alarming: By the 
end of 1993 the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations had 
reported 1,814 acts of violence with right-wing extremist 
motives. Eight people were killed; in 1992 there were 17 deaths. 
<H5>  The Right-Wing Extremist Scene in Germany </H5>
  Parties: 
  The Republikaner (REP): Founded in Munich in 1983. 
[Chairman Franz] Schoenhuber tries to draw a line between the 
party and militant neo-Nazis. Many ex-Republikaner have good 
contacts with the neo-Nazi scene. About 25,000 members. 
  German League for People and Homeland (DL): Collection point 
for former members of the Republikaner and the NPD [National 
Democratic Party]. Ex-Republikaner [and DL Chairman Harald] 
Neubauer has a seat in the European Parliament and is 
establishing Europe-wide contacts. The DL has 1,000 members. 
  National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD): In terms of 
personnel it is closely linked to the neo-Nazi scene. It took 
in members of the German Alternative, cooperates with the Viking 
Youth, and has contacts with Worch (National List, New Front of 
Like-Minded People). About 5,000 members. Its chairman is 
Guenter Deckert. 
  German People's Union (DVU): With 26,000 members it is one 
of the largest right-wing extremist organizations. Publisher 
[Gerhard] Frey (DEUTSCHE NATIONAL-ZEITUNG) cooperates with the 
Russian fascist Zhirinovskiy. It has contacts with the DL. 
  Liberal German Workers Party (FAP): The only openly national 
socialist party. Has taken in many activists of the National 
Offensive, the German Alternative, and the Nationalist Front. 
Attracts attention by marches and militant actions. About 220 
members. Its chairman is Friedhelm Busse. 
  Umbrella Organization: 
  New Front of Like-Minded People (GdNF): The GdNF considers 
itself as the cadre organization of the right-wing movement in 
Germany. Its goal is the new establishment of the NSDAP 
[National Socialist German Workers' Party, or Nazi party]. The 
GdNF coordinates nationwide actions and has contact with foreign 
right- wing extremists. All leading German neo-Nazis belong to 
it. The head of the GdNF is Christian Worch. 
  Banned Organizations: 
  German Alternative (DA): The strongest militant neo-Nazi 
group in the new laender: 350 members. Active in particular in 
Saxony and Brandenburg. Banned on 10 December 1992. Many of its 
members have joined the NPD. Its chairman was Frank Huebner. 
  Nationalist Front (NF): A militant organization headed by 
ex-NPD member [Meinolf] Schoenborn, it had weapons and 
ammunition. It was banned on 27 November 1992. A large number 
of its 130 activists gathered in the Central German Youth 
Promotion Project. 
  National Offensive (NO): This is a collection point for 
disillusioned FAP members in Bavaria, Saxony, and Brandenburg. 
It intended to form "autonomous structures." It was banned on 
22 December 1992; it had 150 members at the last count. Its 
chairman was Michael Swierczek. 
  Organizations: 
  National List (NL): Founded by Kuehnen followers in Hamburg 
in 1989. The NL considers itself as a "spearhead" and often 
appears as the organizer of rightist meetings. The NL has about 
30 members, and its leader is Christian Worch. 
  German Hesse (DH): It is a small but striking group. The 
leaders belong to the inner circle of the German neo-Nazi scene. 
It cultivates contacts with the Viking Youth, the FAP, and the 
banned DA. It has about 60 members. Heinz Reisz is the group's 
leader. 
  Viking Youth (WJ): The oldest right-wing extremist 
organization in Germany, it was founded in 1952. In tent camps 
young people get paramilitary training. It has contacts with 
the NPD and has about 400 members. Its leader is Wolfgang 
Nahrath. 
  Central German Youth Promotion Project (FMJ): This is 
considered to be the successor organization of the banned DA and 
NF. It is primarily active in Brandenburg. It publishes the 
agitating brochure ANGRIFF [Attack], and has 100 members. The 
founder of the FMJ is Andreas Pohl. 
  Votan's People (WV): Its leader, Arnulf Priem, was the NPD's 
landtag candidate in 1974. The military sports group WV 
developed in 1987 as a sidekick of the Germanic-racist "Asgard 
League." It has about 40 members. 
  Right-Wing Extremist International 
  United States: The NSDAP/AO [National Socialist Workers' 
Party/Foreign Organization] is the most important supplier of 
material to the German neo-Nazis. It maintains good contacts 
with the GdNF. Worldwide it has 5,000 members. Its leader is 
Gary Lauck. 
  Austria: Gottfried Kuessel, the imprisoned leader of the 
Extraparliamentary Opposition Loyal to the People [VAPO] was a 
speaker at rightist rallies in Germany. 
  Russia: Vladimir Zhirinovskiy demands a German-Russian 
alliance in the "struggle for white Europe." It has good 
contacts with DVU and DL. 
  Alliances: 
  Sweden: White Aryan Resistance -- 50-100 militant members; 
  Denmark: Danish National Socialist Movement -- several 
hundred members; 
  Latvia: Movement of National Independence -- 1,600 members; 
  The Netherlands: Nederlandse Blok [Dutch Block] -- several 
hundred members; 
  Great Britain: British National Party -- 2,000 members; 
Blood and Honour -- several thousand followers all over the 
world;

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Paper Bomb at Spanish Embassy"] </F>
  [Text] Rome, 3 Feb (ANSA) -- Early results of an analysis 
of the bomb remnants indicated that only part of it, around the 
detonator, exploded. If this is confirmed by investigators, it 
would represent a major change in the scale and direction of 
terrorist violence against Spanish targets in Rome, experts said. 
  The probable target of the attack was the owner of the car, 
Spanish military attache Ruano Fernando Sagristano, 
investigators say--raising the hypothesis that the persons who 
planted the bomb meant to kill him. 
  As to the authors, they pointed to the Basque terrorist 
organisation, ETA, which has been responsible for a string of 
largely symbolic bomb attacks in Rome, against property rather 
than individuals.

  [Text] Madrid and Pamplona have once again been the scene 
of explosions of devices planted at various offices. A young 
woman has been injured in Madrid. 
  Two bombs went off at a Finance Ministry office in Madrid 
and 
another at an INEM [National Institute of Employment] office. 
GRAPO [October 1 Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups] gave warning of 
the planting of the first bomb. 
  A third threat alerted the police to another device at a 
social security office. 
  In Pamplona residents were awakened this morning by four 
explosions. ETA warned that bombs had been planted.

<F P=106> [Report by Sinan Onus] </F>
  [Text] During the National Security Council meeting the 
previous day President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister Tansu 
Ciller were given a report on Armenia, prepared over the last 
year by MIT [National Intelligence Organization] and the 
intelligence department of the Security Directorate. There were 
indications that the "top secret" report produced documentary 
evidence of Armenia-PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] ties. 
  Noting that Armenia directly supports the PKK, the report 
showed that PKK militants are being trained in 13 Armenian 
villages. Stating that members of the Kurdish minority in 
Armenia are being encouraged and given money to join the PKK, 
the report claimed that the Armenians are also acting as 
mediators with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria to secure arms and 
ammunition for the PKK. 
  The report claimed that in improving PKK's ties with 
Armenia, 
ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] laid 
the groundwork for the establishment of PKK bases in that 
country. 
  Explaining that Armenia's aim in helping the PKK is to 
oppress the Kurdish people living in eastern Anatolia, the 
report said: "In the long term, this country aims to isolate 
the PKK and, using the popular base in the region, to realize 
the illusion of a greater Armenia."

<F P=106> [Interview with Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin by </F>
Egyptian weekly newspaper AL-'ARABI correspondent Ghunaym 
'Abduh; place, date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] ['Abduh] Turkey does not want 
to know the internal reasons or motives of the Kurdish problem. 
It does not want to listen directly to the Kurds or their 
proposals for a solution. Indeed, Turkey is searching for a 
solution to the problem beyond its border, making threats 
against neighboring countries. What is your comment? 
  [Cetin] The Turkish Government realizes that the essence of 
Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] terrorism stems from Turkish 
territory. But it is fueled by the party's branches outside 
Turkey, which extend into neighboring countries and some 
European capitals, where the party has representation offices. 
We are always eager to discuss this subject during all our 
meetings with our neighbors and European allies. 
  I am glad we convinced the allies. This was manifest in 
Germany's recent strict measures against the party. PKK offices 
in Germany and other parts of Europe have been closed. An 
inclination to cooperate has also emerged from the governments 
of Syria and Iran and from Kurdish leaders in northern Iraq. 
  In its handling of PKK terrorism, Turkish policy is based on 
suppressing it and rapidly implementing immense investment 
projects in southeast Turkey to improve public services and 
standards of living, hoping to achieve tangible results soon. 
The parliament--approximately 25 percent of the members of 
which are Kurds--the press and the media and the various 
academies are involved in a broad dialogue on the proposed or 
possible solutions to the problem of backwardness in southeast 
Turkey to end PKK terrorism. [passage omitted] 
  ['Abduh] The deputy chairman of the Islamic Welfare Party in 
Turkey has stated that the West is using its protection of Iraqi 
Kurds to back the PKK and fight the Islamic tide in Turkey. As 
an example, he mentioned the U.S. ambassador's visit to 
southeast Turkey in an effort to surround the Islamists in 
Turkey. 
  [Cetin] The American ambassador's visit aimed to achieve 
nothing of this sort. Since the beginning, U.S. policy has 
firmly opposed terrorism and the PKK. This was announced on 
various levels. The visit had nothing to do with an alleged 
fight against the Islamic tide. 
  ['Abduh] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has recently affirmed 
that Turkey will not relinquish secularism in any circumstances. 
How are you going to deal with the growing fundamentalist tide 
in Turkey? 
  [Cetin] Secularism is one of the basic principles on which 
Turkish democracy is built. It provides freedom of expression. 
Expressing religious views has always been one of the features 
of political life in Turkey. This expression has always 
occupied a complementary position. Fundamentalism is excessive 
religious fanaticism that seeks to overthrow secularist 
democracy. 
  Secularism does not deny Islam. And it is not a call to 
isolate Islam from national life. Conservative religious trends 
are not new to Turkey. Since the seventies, religion has been 
part of political life, although not a major part.

<F P=106> [Report by Faruk Balikci: "Journalists Not Allowed Into the </F>
Zhalah Camp"] 
  [Text] Irbil--Journalists have not been allowed to enter 
the Zhalah camp in northern Iraq, which was bombed by Turkish 
Air Force units. The Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] informed 
Turkish journalists who traveled to northern Iraq to visit the 
Zhalah camp after it was bombed in a cross-border air operation 
on Friday that the "embargo on the press is being maintained" 
and that they will not be allowed into the camp. 
  Several Kurdish sources in the region have claimed that the 
PKK militants left the Zhalah camp at 0500 and returned at 1900 
on 26 January. 
  Meanwhile, 'Abdallah Rasul Kusret, prime minister of the 
federal Kurdish state in northern Iraq, said that his government 
was not informed about Turkey's air operation. He asserted: 
"Consequently, we were not able to take precautionary measures 
in our villages. We lost 18 people in Sheni, Goreser, and Sune, 
which are close to the border. Many of our people were wounded. 
Nine people were killed and 19 others were wounded in Iran. 
The PKK lost only seven men." 
  Stressing that they have informed Ankara on their reaction 
to 
the air operation, Kosret said: "The Zhalah camp is 120 km from 
Turkey's border. PKK maintained its activities in areas close 
to Turkey. We signed a protocol with that organization and 
allowed its members to settle in the Zhalah camp. Our objective 
was to keep the PKK away from the border. Turkey is aware of 
that. The protocol we have signed is still valid. The PKK 
members are in the Zhalah camp. That is where they maintain 
their activities." 
  Local sources have said that 1,200 militants were based in 
that camp until recently. However, they also said that 
considering the possibility of an air attack, the PKK recently 
reduced the number of its militants in that camp to 500 and 
began to use it as a facility for support services instead of a 
base for military and political training.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi by Samir </F>
Tawfiq; place, date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Tawfiq] Which countries finance terrorism in 
Egypt and when will they be named? Not naming them causes 
confusion. Defining them is important so that we know the 
countries that do not want stability for us. 
  [Al-Alfi] We have some good information about the financing 
and training places and the planners and their locations. But 
there is an advantage in not revealing all the facts about this 
issue, because there are continuing efforts and intense contacts 
under way with numerous countries to cooperate with us. Indeed, 
several fugitive terrorists have been arrested and others have 
been handed over. I hope you will not ask for the names of 
these countries and any figures right now, so that we will leave 
them in the dark. 
  [Tawfiq] But the minister told a news conference he would 
name these countries. 
  [Al-Alfi] Yes, but I said I would do that at the proper 
time. 
When I announce a specific location and say we brought in 
someone from there, his colleagues will go elsewhere or flee the 
country and thus we will have done them a service by warning 
them. 
  The same thing applies to terrorist operations. Sometimes we 
ask that news of such operations is not published and 
journalists start asking in whose interest is this secrecy. I 
tell them: Yes, there is an advantage, that of the 
investigation. 
  There are two examples: First, when we arrested the first 
suspect and banned the publication [of news] on the attempt to 
kill the prime minister. Then, we arrested nine suspects in 
subsequent measures. 
  The second example was the Hulwan movie theater incident. 
After news was published of two arrests, the others escaped 
after reading the newspapers. We had pinpointed their locations 
but found nothing except that day's newspapers. [passage omitted] 
  It is not only Egypt that faces terrorism, because it is 
apparent that there is a plot to strike at every Arab and 
Islamic country in the name of Islam. Training in implementing 
this plot takes place abroad, where they assemble personnel of 
every nationality in one place. The methods of arming, 
training, and financing are the same. I saw pictures of 
incidents carried out by terrorists abroad and found them 
compatible with what happens in Egypt. The bombs have the same 
materials; they put nails and ball bearings in the bombs and use 
the same detonator. Weapons here and abroad are used in the 
same way and the training is the same. [passage omitted] 
  If we had wanted to eliminate terrorism fast, we could have 
done so by resorting to extraordinary measures. But we are 
confronting terrorism with law and democracy, not resorting to 
extraordinary measures. 
  In addition to aborting the plots that were prepared during 
the new year, Christmas, and police day celebrations, we aborted 
other plots, arrested the plotters, and seized documents 
containing the names of some personalities. But I will not name 
names. All these are now cases, which will be referred to the 
court. The trials will be public. But secrecy will be 
maintained during the interrogation period. 
  [Tawfiq] Have antiterrorism steps been developed? 
  [Al-Alfi] Most important for us, the security men, is that 
we 
adopt a scientific course and sound planning and train on the 
highest level, in addition to acquiring weapons. The police 
department has been supplied with the most modern weapons. 
Police missions travel abroad. Technicians and experts arrive 
in Egypt to train us. The whole department has undergone such 
training. 
  I want to say something: Our action is no longer a 
tit-for-tat response. The initiative now is in the hands of the 
police. This has produced better results. We are searching for 
the terrorists' hideouts. We have arrested many terrorists and 
seized their equipment, explosives, and weapons. Thus, we have 
foiled several incidents before they took place. 
  If the terrorists are targeting policemen to get at the 
morale of the entire police department, I tell them: Every 
incident against a policeman, security man, or any citizen 
increases our determination to eliminate these terrorists. It 
also deepens our faith because we uphold justice and defend 
religion and the homeland. The initiative is in our hands and 
will remain so, despite the sacrifices. [passage omitted] 
  [Tawfiq] Terrorist incidents take place in broad daylight in 
crowded places in Upper Egypt's governorates. How do you 
explain the people's failure to resist the terrorists? Is this 
due to the negative attitude of the Upper Egypt resident to some 
customs and traditions that prevent him from intervening or to 
the police's bad treatment of citizens? 
  [Al-Alfi] One thing manifested in these crimes is the custom 
of taking revenge. This custom still exists. In some cities 
and villages in Upper Egypt, the people take their own revenge 
and do not surrender the criminal to the authorities. They 
don't even receive condolences for their own dead until they 
have taken revenge. Some families teach their children to take 
revenge as soon as they are old enough to use firearms. The 
mountains on both sides of the valley in Upper Egypt also make 
it easy for criminals and accused people to escape. 
  I can say the police don't get involved in ill treatment. 
But there is no doubt that like other police forces, there are 
violations. 
  [Tawfiq] Why, when owners of licensed weapons apply to renew 
their licenses, are weapons being withdrawn? This is happening 
more and more. And why have stringent measures been adopted 
when it comes to granting new licenses? 
  [Al-Alfi] It is not an issue of making things easier or more 
difficult. The firearms law is clear. There must be 
justifications and reasons, as stipulated by law, for granting a 
firearms license. What is happening is that some people are 
carrying weapons without any legal justification. But when 
there is a justification, the license is issued immediately. 
Many incidents happened in Upper Egypt in front of people 
carrying licensed weapons; they did not attempt to intervene. 
The issue here does not relate to licensed or unlicensed 
weapons, but to customs and traditions. 
  In the past few months we seized about 18,000 unlicensed 
weapons. We also discovered many weapons manufacturing shops and 
stores illegally trading in weapons. These stores' licenses 
have been canceled and their owners brought to trial. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Police special branch teams are hunting for a 
Pakistani man with links to the World Trade Centre bombing who 
is suspected of killing two U.S. intelligence agency employees 
last year, a police source told REUTER. 
  Thai police received information from Washington that Mir 
Aimal Kansi, 30, slipped into Thailand in mid-December to hide 
in the network of guerrilla and criminal gangs operating here, 
according to the source, a senior member of the special branch 
who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
  Kansi was suspected of killing two employees of the Central 
Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Virginia on January 25, 1993. 
  He was also suspected of operating in the same gang as 
Muhammad Farooq and Ramzi Ahmad Yousef, suspects in the Febuary 
26, 1993 bombing of New York's World Trade Center. 
  Although Thai police have not received information on 
Farooq's or Yousef's whereabouts, they have circulated wanted 
posters for all three men in Thai tourist resorts. The posters 
offer a US$2 million reward in exchange for information leading 
to their arrest. 
  The source said Thai police had sent three teams to search 
for Kansi in the tourist resorts of Pattaya, Phuket and Hat Yai, 
one to northern Thailand and two to the Muslim-dominated 
provinces of Pattani and Narathiwat. 
  "But so far there is no clue leading to the suspect," he 
said. "We believe he has had cosmetic surgery done to his face, 
is carrying false travelling documents and is associating with 
international gangsters." 
  At least a dozen members of international criminal gangs and 
guerrilla networks, especially from the Islamic countries of 
Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Syria, are operating in 
Bangkok, the source said.

<F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev] </F>
  [Text] The Cypriot security services suspect that Iran is 
trying to set up a regional command in Cyprus to organize Iran's 
terrorist activities in Lebanon and other Middle East countries. 
The conclusions of the Cypriot security services' investigation 
on this matter have been recently conveyed to Jerusalem. 
  The Cypriot authorities have recently taken action to foil 
the Iranian plans. Among other actions, they prohibited the 
entry of several Iranian citizens to the island. 
  According to Jerusalem, Israel "monitors" the developments 
and is in close contact with the Cypriot authorities. The 
investigation conducted by the Cypriot security services showed 
that Iranians have recently purchased houses in Cyprus. In 
addition, lively traffic has been noticed between the two 
countries. A probe revealed that a plan to make Cyprus a terror 
base was behind these phenomena.
