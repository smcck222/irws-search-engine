<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Khatzivasilis] </F>
  [Text] As of yesterday, the Cyprus Police have increased 
security measures at Jordanian interests in Cyprus following 
information that terrorist attacks might be launched against 
them. 
  The information was conveyed to the security authorities 
after the recent assassination of the Jordanian Embassy first 
secretary in Beirut by the Palestinian organization, Hamas 
[Islamic Movement]. The Hamas organization proceeded with this 
action after Jordan deported 24 Iranians. However, because of 
Jordan's stance on the Israeli-Palestinian talks on the Middle 
East issue, fears are expressed that the incident will not end 
there. 
  This is why the Cyprus authorities have increased security 
measures at the Royal Jordanian Airlines offices in Nicosia 
while police patrols in the surrounding area have also been 
increased and the police guards have strict orders to keep their 
eyes open. Measures have also been adopted at other "targets." 
  As is known, Jordan does not have an embassy or any other 
diplomatic mission in Cyprus but it has a person who functions 
as a representative. 
  The police have heightened vigilance to avert any possible 
criminal acts.

  [Text] Two groups from the Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB] have 
bombed the main offices of the nation's three leading oil 
companies -- Petron and Shell in Makati, and Caltex-Philippines 
in Manila -- almost simultaneously. After the incident, the ABB 
called a radio station to claim responsibility for the bombings. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Noel Perfecto] First, the 
terrorists bombed Petron's main office in Makati at 6:15 a.m. 
this morning. The security guard on duty was slightly injured 
in the blast. Police said that the blast did not cause serious 
damage to the Petron building, but damaged some windows in the 
adjacent Mandarin Oriental Hotel building. Five minutes later, 
the ABB bombed Shell House on Paleros Street in Legaspi Village. 
There was not much damage from the explosion, because the bomb 
fell in front of the powerhouse. 
  Makati Chief Remy Macaspar said that the bombs used were 
strong enough to kill people and damage property: 
  [Macaspar, in English] Regional Director General Sarmiento 
ordered to intensify our intelligence efforts as well as 
repressive patrolling, such that last evening he was also out 
there in the field. He really checked the prevailing situation. 
We concentrated on gasoline stations, but with this development 
we have to consider everything now. 
  [Perfecto] According to reports, the bombing of 
Caltex-Philippines in Manila came five minutes after the bombing 
of Shell House. Colonel Macaspar disclosed that police had 
brought the driver of the taxi used by the bombers in for 
questioning. The driver was identified as Abunjon Dabat. He 
said that he was forced out of the taxi after the bombings were 
completed: 
  [Dabat] Before making a U-turn into the Mandarin Hotel, he 
told me to pull over in front of the Petron Building. Then he 
said that he was going to get out and drop something off. When 
he got out of the taxi cab, I saw him holding something round. 
Then he lit it and hurled it at Petron's door. Then he 
returned to the cab and I started driving again. He told me to 
turn right at Paseo Roxas and right again at Citibank. When we 
were at the corner near Citibank, he told me to stop because he 
was going to throw something again. That is what he said. 
  [Perfecto] Shell House's security guard, identified as 
Rogelio Valdes, said that the bombers appeared to be youths. 
  Is this what the object that was thrown at your building 
looked like? [video shows Perfecto holding several sticks of 
dynamite wired together] 
  [Valdes] Yes. It looked like this, but it was wrapped in 
brown paper. 
  [Perfecto] Do you think there were also as many sticks as 
this? 
  [Valdes] Yes. I think there were as many sticks as that, 
because it was as big as that. 
  [Perfecto] But you did not notice that they were using a 
taxi? 
  [Valdes] No. I did not notice whether the taxi that passed 
by my post was the one that the bombers used. 
  [Perfecto] As of air time, the Capcom [Capital Command] had 
alerted all of its centers and placed a tight guard on all vital 
government offices and buildings that are potential bombing 
targets. [end recording] 
  In a related development, strict security measures are being 
implemented at the Energy Regulatory Board [ERB] and Land 
Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board. The ERB office 
received a bomb threat after the bombing of the three oil firms' 
offices. Strict security is also being enforced at the offices 
of the National Power Corporation and the Metropolitan 
Waterworks and Sewer System. Meanwhile, the Philippine National 
Police call on the public to support the security measures that 
will be put into place at all sensitive government offices and 
some private companies.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mithat Emini Arrested"] </F>
  [Text] The former secretary-general of PDP [Party for 
Democratic Prosperity] was arrested on Saturday under the 
charges of founded suspicion that he was involved in the affair 
with the organization of paramilitary Albanian formations in 
Macedonia and arms smuggling, MIC reports, quoting reliable 
sources in the interior ministry. 
  The district attorney Gligor Serafimovski confirmed this 
information to MIC. However, he denied that Emini was 
transferred from prison in Skopje to the state polyclinic, due 
to heart difficulties. 
  MIC found out that the court proceedings of the group of 
Albanians, including an Albanian with Macedonian and U.S. 
citizenship, all indicted under the same charges, are expected 
to begin toward the end of this week. 
  Toward the beginning of last November, the Macedonian police 
arrested the Deputy Minister of Defense Husein Haskaj, together 
with a larger group of Albanians, under the suspicion of 
smuggling arms and organizing paramilitary and parapolice 
organizations in Macedonia. 
  The Minister of the Interior Ljubomir Frckovski stated, at 
the time, that "there is a founded suspicion that the Deputy 
Minister of Defense Haskaj was involved in the expert estimation 
and giving advice to a foreign state, which is in the sphere of 
giving out state secrets." The Ministry of Defense denied this 
information and explained that Haskaj did not have at his 
disposal information about the defense plan of the Republic of 
Macedonia. 
  Frckovski also denied that an arsenal of 300 automatic guns 
were found on the suspects, but only 35. Frckovski also denied 
that a list of 20,000 recruits of the Albanian paramilitary in 
Macedonia was also found on the people arrested. "It is quite 
possible," Frckovski said, "that the arrested individuals were 
preparing a concept for organized paramilitary action." 
  The police then announced that this was otherwise the fourth 
cut off arms smuggling channel in Macedonia. The first had come 
from Croatia through Bulgaria, the second from FRY through 
Bulgaria, and third through Salonika, into Macedonia.

  The explosive devices, which contained 2 kg of dynamite 
apiece, were detonated at the same time. In the Mormon church, 
the damage was estimated at 7 million pesos. Seven years ago, 
another attack completely destroyed the church.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 3 February (DPA) -- Two 
medium-intensity bombs exploded today in the Colombian city of 
Medellin. No fatalities were reported, but severe damage was 
caused, police have stated. 
  The first bomb exploded in front of a bank office in the 
center of the city. After the explosion, a fire broke out but 
was rapidly contained. 
  A second bomb exploded minutes later at the gate of the 
English Language Academy, which sustained severe damage. 
  According to police, these are new extremist actions 
perpetrated by movements that oppose the presence of U.S. 
soldiers in several parts of Colombia, where they have built 
bases for the Colombian Government to combat drug trafficking. 
  Two weeks ago terrorists detonated bombs against a Mormon 
church that was operated by U.S. citizens in the western part of 
Medellin. They also attacked other U.S. interests in this city, 
which is located in the northwestern part of Colombia. 
  (Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network in Spanish at 
1200 GMT on 3 February, during its "Caracol's 0600-0900" 
newscast, adds: "Authorities have blamed guerrillas for the 
explosion of two bombs in the city of Medellin.")

  [Excerpt] Shining Path members hoisted a big flag in San 
Juan de Lurigancho district yesterday [23 January] and asked 
Shining Path members "to lay down the arms" and to obey 
"President Gonzalo." Meanwhile, that evening a terrorist 
commando dynamited the Presidente Hotel in Huancayo, causing 
considerable damage. 
  These two events, which occurred almost simultaneously, and 
the two murders committed by subversives in the city of Huancayo 
prove that inside the terrorist organization there is a radical, 
fanatic group that does not want the "peace agreement" demanded 
by Abimael Guzman and wants to continue to ravage the country 
with selective murders and acts of sabotage. 
  Although there are indications that the Shining Path faction 
that wants to "lay down its arms" (it can be deduced that this 
expression means sort of "cease fire" from their point of view) 
is the majority and predominant sector. It is also obvious that 
the fanatic group who do not want to stop their insane bout of 
murders and attacks is still active in several places in the 
country. 
  From the letters recently written by the Shining Path 
members 
held at Canto Grande prison, and by their leader Cox 
Beuzeville--and also from the big flag displayed yesterday--it 
can be seen that Shining Path members are in no way considering 
surrender, much less giving up their arms. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Islamic Jihad Secretary General Fathi </F>
al-Shiqaqi by an unidentified AL-'AHD correspondent; date and 
place not given] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-'AHD] What happened during the recent 
meetings of the 10 factions [opposed to the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement]? How did the factions surmount their differences? 
Or are there still many differences among them? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] Since the beginning of September 1993, when 
news 
of the Oslo agreement began to leak, the 10 factions have held 
meetings to discuss the possibility of upgrading their year-old 
coalition. There was talk of establishing a national Islamic 
front with a political program that would be more advanced than 
the earlier points of minimum agreement among them and more 
developed organizationally. It took some time to agree on the 
front's name and its program. The disagreement at this stage 
was with the brothers in the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine because of certain political differences over the 
interim program and UN resolutions. Eventually, faced with 
pressure to be responsible, all the conferees found common 
ground for building a political program and outlining political 
tasks within the context of a front called "The Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces." Ideological differences were avoided. 
After this, the meeting was adjourned for a week pending a new 
proposal that was being prepared by the brothers in Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement]. 
  On the evening of Wednesday, 15 January 1993, the last 
meeting was held. Hamas made a new proposal that appeared to 
call for a formula that was stronger than the existing 10 
factions framework but still weaker than a front. It became 
apparent that the proposed political program, or rather the 
proposed political tasks, differed in more than one aspect than 
what had been agreed upon earlier. The organizational formula, 
however, treated all the factions as equals. The 5 January [date 
as published] meeting was tense and anxiety-ridden at first and 
it appeared headed toward a deadlock. 
  Personally, however, I was optimistic and worked hard to 
bridge the gap between the position of the Hamas brothers and 
the positions of the other factions. I made several specific 
proposals to end the differences and when it became clear that 
my proposals would be received positively, we recessed the 
meeting for half an hour for private consultations within each 
faction and for bilateral consultations. During the recess I 
discussed the issue with the brothers in Hamas after holding 
quick meetings with the other factions. We returned to the 
conference room to announce that we had reached a full agreement 
that would satisfy everyone. An atmosphere of optimism and 
satisfaction replaced the tension and anxiety. We began to 
review the documents in a sincere and easy manner and decided to 
hold a press conference the next day to proclaim the happy news 
to our people about the establishment of "The Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces." 
  I can say that we have overcome the basic obstacles to such 
an alliance. However, there are pending issues of less 
importance. We will discuss them at a meeting of the central 
leadership in less than two weeks. 
  [AL-'AHD] Did you leave the meeting with a clearly defined 
program, or will you continue with the former methods? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] We have agreed on clear and specific political 
tasks. Some are strategic and had to be spelled out in the 
agreement. Other tasks are interim and include the need to 
confront the Oslo agreement and its dangers. The basic tasks on 
which we agreed will guide our future activities. As for 
detailed plans, we will discuss them at future meetings. I will 
not hide from our people or the masses represented by our 
alliance that we are facing very difficult and complex 
circumstances. In the absence of any international or regional 
backing, what is being done on the real battleground inside 
Palestine will play the decisive role. The strength of the new 
alliance will be measured by its actual impact on the battle 
inside the homeland. We have taken an important step forward. 
Although we have no magical solutions, we are determined to do 
everything in our power to carry out the tasks on which we have 
agreed. [passage omitted] 
  Just as we rejected the agreement, we will reject the 
elections. Our resolve cannot be shaken by any incentives. The 
future of Palestine is a million times more important than a 
lowly, worthless council. I advise all hesitant people and 
advocates of realism among those who once chose struggle and 
jihad not to come close to this pyre. I am convinced, however, 
that a certain party to the agreement will delete the election 
clause from the declaration of principles. 
  Concerning municipal elections or other ones, we determine 
our position based on their political significance and function. 
We will boycott any institution or organization stemming from 
the self-rule authority and entailing recognition of the Zionist 
enemy and its occupation of our land. But we will deal 
positively, as we did in the past, with the other institutions 
and with society's infrastructure. 
  [AL-'AHD] You strongly reject what is taking place. What 
alternative are you proposing, taking into account that the 
people continue to suffer in the occupied territories? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] What is the cause of the people's suffering? 
The occupation, of course. According to the Oslo agreement, 
will the occupation end? No, the opposite is true. The enemy 
wants to rid itself of the occupation's burdens and costs but 
wants to maintain the occupation's essence and role. We will 
then have to bear an occupation with double the burden. When 
the occupation continues, in disguise or without one, it will 
cast the burdens that it used to carry onto our shoulders. 
Saying that the above agreement will end our people's suffering 
is a major illusion that they are trying to sell us. What is 
really serious is that we are buying this illusion at a price 
greater than any nation ever paid, namely by acknowledging the 
enemy's continued presence on the entire territory of our sacred 
homeland. When our people have arisen in this century it 
certainly was not for the purpose of filling their bellies. 
They rose up because they yearned for liberty, independence, 
identity, and the preservation of their faith and sanctities. 
If all this is lost, is it important if one fills one's belly? 
Even the illusions of prosperity are belied by the conditions 
suffered by all peoples who accept humiliation. 
  This homeland is ours, the sea and the river are ours, and 
the olives and oranges are ours. The logic of the Koran and 
history underline these simple facts. Let us move according to 
this logic and struggle according to it. No matter how many 
battles the nation has lost, it still has not lost the war. It 
possesses aspects of power which, if properly organized, are 
capable of terrifying the invaders. 
  Palestine is the focus and pivot of polarization and 
renewal. 
The pain of jihad is a thousand times better than the pain of 
humiliation. Our alternative is steadfastness, endurance, and 
continued jihad until the balance of power changes. If we 
cannot defeat the enemy today, then at least let us not turn 
into a bridge over which the enemy can cross into the region to 
reshape it in the way he wants and in line with his goals, 
ambitions, and interests. We must not turn into allies and 
guides who show him the way as he presses ahead to control all 
the region's capitals. Let us continue to confront him and 
reduce his danger until the nation rises again and God permits 
change to come. The alternative to this is not peace and an end 
to suffering, but a Zionist, cancerous, destructive deluge. 
  [AL-'AHD] Why do you refuse to meet with Yasir 'Arafat? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] We do not believe there is room for a meeting 
after the Oslo agreement; there is no point. 
  As for why no meeting was held before the agreement, the 
political issue was again the basic reason. We saw constant 
gratuitous retreat in 'Arafat's political position. Add to this 
the war of containment, absorption, and blackmail that the PLO 
chairman waged against the Islamic Jihad movement. He traded in 
the movement's name through some distorted figures he created on 
the Palestinian scene. Claiming to speak for the Islamic Jihad, 
for instance, someone once came up with an announcement 
supporting the Gaza-Jericho agreement at a time when six Fatah 
members rejected it. We cannot be blackmailed, and we are not 
the ones who stand at the door of the Sultan [i.e. we are not 
supplicants]. However, this did not prevent our meetings and 
dialogues over the years with Fatah leaders and cadres; they 
contacted us from time to time. They rejected the PLO 
chairman's practices against the Islamic Jihad and opposed his 
political line, even though he was the one who sent them. 
[passage omitted on Jordan] 
  [AL-'AHD] If Hamas contests the self-rule elections, what 
will your position be? You will be standing alone against the 
plan. 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] The brothers in Hamas have repeatedly stressed 
to us that they are against the elections and that they will 
boycott them. They assert that their position is final and 
decisive. The program of the basic tasks of the Palestinian 
forces' alliance is clear in this respect. 
  At any rate, our position proceeds from our principled 
commitment to our people, homeland, and nation; from our 
understanding and analysis of the conspiracy against Palestine, 
and from our understanding and interpretation of the reality and 
the fact that the infamous agreement means an alliance with the 
enemy against the entire nation and region. We will remain 
witnesses before God and history, unharmed by those who oppose 
us. We will remain the conscience of the nation, even if we are 
reduced to only one person. However, we believe that a large 
sector of our people and their other leading forces stand with 
us in the same trench.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Palestinian Official Denies Attempt </F>
To Assassinate 'Arafat by Shooting Down His Aircraft With 
Missile"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- An authoritative source 
at the Palestinian embassy in Amman yesterday denied reports of 
the uncovering of a plot to assassinate Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat during his visit to Amman last month. 
  The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that these reports are 
absolutely baseless and unfounded. The source added that he had 
no information about reports that Jordanian security forces had 
arrested a Palestinian group armed with shoulder-mounted rockets 
prepared for launching in the direction of 'Arafat's aircraft as 
it landed in Amman civilian airport. 
  For their part, Jordanian security sources have declined to 
comment on the report, which was published by a local newspaper.

  [Excerpt] Jerusalem -- Jibril al-Rajub, adviser to 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has protested the killing 
of Salim Muwafi, the Fatah Hawks leader in Gaza, by the Israeli 
forces. He considered this act as an attempt to kill the peace 
process. 
  In an exclusive interview with AL-QUDS, al-Rajub said that 
the Palestinian leadership regards the Fatah Hawks as part of 
the forces that have to protect the national authority. 
Consequently, we have to provide security for them. [passage

  [Excerpts] Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], has 
condemned the Gaza-Jericho agreement and the Taba-Davos 
negotiations. [passage omitted] 
  Addressing a crowded ceremony in al-Yarmuk camp in Damascus 
yesterday on the DFLP's 25th anniversary, Hawatimah said that 
the Oslo-Davos agreement [as heard] is a partial and separate 
agreement that gives nothing in return. He noted that this 
agreement was concluded behind the backs of the Palestinian 
people and their intifadah and that it is bound to fail. 
  'Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy secretary general of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], also delivered a 
speech on behalf of the joint PFLP-DFLP command and the alliance 
of Palestinian forces. Sayf Bin-'Ali also delivered a speech on 
behalf of the Arab liberation parties and movements, and 'Ammar 
al-Musawi, deputy head of Hizballah's Political Bureau, 
delivered a speech on behalf of the Lebanese national and 
Islamic resistance. [passage omitted] 
  The rally was attended by a number of secretary generals, 
members of political bureaus and central committees of 
Palestinian factions, a number of representatives of the 
Lebanese national and Islamic movement and Arab liberation 
movements, some members of the diplomatic corps accredited to 
Damascus, and a crowd of citizens.

<F P=106> [Report by Doron Me'iri] </F>
  [Excerpts] Last Thursday, 7 p.m. Dozens of youngsters 
wearing kaffiyehs and armed with batons and knives flock to the 
headquarters of Fatah's "strike police" in the village of 
Abu-Dis in East Jerusalem for their daily briefing. All of them 
are intifadah graduates who decided to renounce terror and join 
the fight against mounting crime in their community. [passage 
omitted] 
  Fatah's "strike police" units began operating about three 
months ago. Their intentions may be good, but their methods are 
shocking. Their activities are primarily aimed at drug dealers. 
Lists of suspected drug dealers and places where deals are 
conducted can be found in its headquarters. The information is 
collected from informers and snitches. 
  "Strike police" troops raid drug-dealing areas every night. 
People caught dealing drugs face a bitter fate: They are taken 
for interrogation in the organization's dungeons where they 
undergo excruciating torture in order to extract information 
from them. A man I encountered at the "strike police" 
headquarters smilingly told me: "Believe me, I have been 
arrested many times in my life -- by Israel Police and by the 
Shin Bet -- but what our interrogators do to their subjects is 
absolutely terrifying." 
  Twenty-six-year-old Shakir, the commander of the "strike 
police" adds: "We interrogate them, and with our methods they 
talk, and talk fast. When the interrogation is over, we break 
one of their arms or legs, their nose, or even slightly fracture 
their skull. Then we explain to them that they are harming 
themselves and the public, and warn them that if caught again 
they will be eliminated." 
  The "strike police" opens "criminal records" for suspects, 
as 
if it were a real police force, and plays the role of 
legislator, judge, and executioner. Shakir argues that his men 
do not restrict their operations to East Jerusalem, and chase 
Arab drug dealers into the boundaries of the Green Line. At 
least on one occasion, Shakir recounts, a drug dealer from the 
territories was spotted in Elat, where he had fled to protect 
himself from the "strike police." This dealer "was arrested and 
dealt with appropriately," Shakir notes. 
  He showed us the weapons used by his men. These include 
batons, ice picks, knives, screwdrivers, ropes, and handcuffs. 
"We do not yet have firearms," he says. "Until three months 
ago our goal had been to fight you, the Israelis. However, from 
the moment 'Arafat and Rabin shook hands, our goal became to 
fight for a better and healthier society, both ours and yours." 
  Shakir argues that his methods have proved themselves, 
seeing 
that the activities of drug dealers in the area has decreased 
considerably. According to him, many of them relocated their 
business to the boundaries of the Green Line for fear of the 
"strike police." "It is important that your police deal with 
them and not let them off the hook," he says. 
  Shakir continues: "The heads of the Palestinian leadership 
apprised Abu-'Ammar (Yasir 'Arafat) of our activities, and we 
were told that he gave them his blessing and that he is pleased 
with them. I hope he will heed our request and give us 
financial aid. In future I definitely envision myself as an 
officer in the Palestinian police force, and I will be happy to 
cooperate with Israel Police to fight crime." 
  The "strike police" has also undertaken the task of dealing 
with drug addicts. Any addict caught in the act is asked to 
enter a rehabilitation center voluntarily. If he fails to do 
that, such treatment is forced on him for four months. [passage

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 4 (MENA)--Ahmad Yahya, owner of a car 
agency in Shibin al-Qanatir, lower Egypt, was killed tonight 
along with two others when unidentified persons opened fire at 
his workplace. Another person was wounded in the incident. 
  Senior Interior Ministry officials rushed to the scene and 
started investigations. 
  [Paris AFP in English at 0147 on 5 February, in a related 
Cairo-datelined item, adds the following: 
  ["Gunmen late Friday shot dead four people here, including a 
prosecution witness in a trial of Moslem fundamentalists, police 
reported. 
  ["They said unidentified assailants opened fire on Sayyid 
Ahmad Yahya, an automobile dealer, in his showroom.

the November 25 attempt on the prime minister's life. 
  ["A second hearing in the trial of nine fundamentalists 
accused of plotting to kill Sidqi was scheduled to open here on 
Saturday. They are members of the Tala'i' al-Fath (The Leaders 
of the Conquest), considered by authorities to be the military 
wing of Al-Jihad fundamentalist movement, which claimed 
responsibility for the operation against the prime minister."]

  [Text] Cairo, Feb. 7 (AFP) -- The outlawed Moslem 
fundamentalist group Jama'ah al-Islamiyah on Monday issued a 
"final warning" for foreigners to leave Egypt. 
  "We have to warn them first so that our religion is innocent 
of the blood which will flow," the group said in a statement 
sent to AFP. 
  It said the killing of a police general in the southern town 
of Asyut Sunday was "the final warning to tourists and investors 
to leave the country." 
  Tourists and investors would be the main targets as a way of 
pressuring the "fascist" government of President Husni Mubarak, 
the group said in a second statement. 
  "The Jama'ah implores all embassies, consulates and 
businessmen to advise their citizens and kin, be they tourists, 
or Arab or Western investors, to leave the country immediately." 
  The group, which wants to turn Egypt into an Iranian-style 
Islamic republic, has frightened away many potential 
holidaymakers, costing the government billions of dollars in 
lost revenue. 
  "He who helps a regime which fights Islam, tortures its 
sons, 
abuses its women and hangs its young will suffer the same 
punishment as tyrants," it said. 
  Suspected Moslem militants on Sunday shot dead police 
general 
Omar Mustafa as he left his house in Asyut. He was the second 
police general to be killed in four days in the town, a hotbed 
of Islamic militancy. 
  On Wednesday, another officer was killed in similar 
circumstances. 
  Jama'ah al-Islamiyah warned foreign investors and tourists 
to 
leave the country last Wednesday hours after a police raid in 
Cairo in which seven militants were killed. The group warned it 
would retaliate against the "massacre" by police. 
  Sunday's attack in Asyut brought to 297 the number of people 
killed since the Moslem militants launched a violent campaign to 
overthrow the secular government of President Husni Mubarak in 
March 1992. 
  The fundamentalists have targeted policemen, senior 
government officials, foreign tourists and Coptic Christians. 
More than half of the 107 policemen were killed in Asyut.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by Ahmad Idris in Islamabad] </F>
  [Text] Severe differences have surfaced among Egyptian 
Islamic groups regarding the warnings issued to foreigners that 
they should leave the country. In a statement to our radio by 
telephone, the official in charge of the Information Bureau of 
the Conquest Vanguards Organization [tanzim tala'i al-fatah] 
condemned, on behalf of the organization, the warning issued 
three days ago by the al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah to foreigners and 
its threats to strike at foreign investors and their projects in 
Egypt. He said: 
  [Begin recording] The Islamic masses and the whole nation 
know that Islam -- as all scholars have always been unanimous -- 
has forbidden any act that harms the Muslims. Thus, striking at 
the Egyptian economy and at legal investments will harm the 
Muslim masses there. [end recording] 
  The statement notes that this will isolate the Islamists and 
provide excuses to uproot them. The statement calls on the 
Egyptian leadership to apply the Islamic law and wipe out 
hotbeds of corruption to end armed confrontation and improve the 
situation.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 8 (AFP) -- The main Moslem militant group 
here on Tuesday called on Egyptians to pull their money out of 
banks within two weeks and claimed a bomb attack on a branch in 
Cairo. 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [IG], which has waged a bloody 
campaign against the secular government of President Husni 
Mubarak, said it planted the bomb which exploded outside a bank 
here Monday night. The bomb went off after the bank closed to 
avoid causing any injuries, said the statement which was sent to 
AFP. 
  The group has urged tourists and foreign investors to quit 
the country, saying it is stepping up its violent campaign 
following the killing of seven of its members by the security 
forces last week. 
  The militants are trying to cripple the Egyptian economy as 
part of their campaign to bring down the Mubarak government and 
install an Iranian-style Islamic republic. 
  The group said Egyptians should withdraw all their cash from 
Egyptian banks within two weeks, and Monday's blast was "part of 
al-Jama'ah's fight against the regime." 
  Almost 300 people have died since the fundamentalists began 
their campaign two years ago, and the money-spinning tourist 
industry has been brought to its knees.

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 10 (AFP) -- The main Moslem militant 
group on Thursday [10 February] claimed responsibility for the 
murder of a policeman in southern Egypt and warned bank 
depositors that time was running out for them to withdraw their 
funds. 
  The group said in a statement sent to AFP that Wednesday's 
shooting of a policeman was the fourth operation out of seven to 
avenge the killing of seven of its members last week by police. 
  Three other people were wounded when the policeman was shot 
outside a mosque in Aswan, 900 kilometers (540 miles) south of 
Cairo. 
  Some 300 people have died since the militants began their 
campaign two years ago, and the money-spinning tourist industry 
has been brought to its knees. 
  The al-Jama'ah on Tuesday gave bank clients two weeks to 
withdraw their money, warning that its campaign against "usury" 
will become "more violent and ferocious." Islam prohibits the 
charging of interest on loans. 
  It added Thursday that bank clients should "withdraw rapidly 
their funds before losing them." 
  The militants seek to bring down the government of President 
Husni Mubarak and install an Iranian-style Islamic republic.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 7 Feb (MENA)--The Supreme Military Court, 
which is considering the case of the attempted assassination of 
Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, held a session today to continue 
hearing the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses in the 
case, in which 15 people are being tried, six of them in 
absentia. 
  The court saw two videotapes on which the supreme state 
security prosecution recorded a staged version of the incident 
and how it was carried out. The fifth and sixth defendants 
related how the crime was committed and the role of each one of 
them, as well as the role of the seventh defendant who 
participated in the crime, how they prepared the explosive 
charge used in the incident, and how they monitored the prime 
minister's movements. 
  The court also saw a videotape about an examination of the 
house of the fifth defendant Salah al-Din [name indistinct] in 
al-Minufiyah, in which the police found electrical equipment, 
weapons, and explosives being prepared for use in some terrorist 
operations. [passage omitted] 
  The Supreme Military Court decided to adjourn its sessions 
until tomorrow to hear the remaining witnesses who assisted the 
police or took part in capturing the defendants. 
  The court decided to refer the fifth defendant, Salah 
al-Din, 
to a physician to determine the truth about his claim that he 
was tortured. The court also decided to summon the commander 
and some members of the prime minister's guard to hear their 
testimony. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has stressed that the security organs serve and protect 
everybody, both Egyptians and foreigners. [passage omitted] 
  In reply to a question about the countries that support and 
sponsor the terrorist groups, the interior minister said that a 
number of countries are supporting and sponsoring the terrorists 
but he refused to divulge these countries' names, saying that 
there are diplomatic contacts to sign security agreements on the 
extradition of these elements. [passage omitted] 
  In reply to a question about the terrorists' names and 
leaders, the interior minister said that the terrorist groups' 
leaders are abroad and are known to the security organs. They 
also recruit people in the country in the name of religion, 
which is innocent of them. [passage omitted] 
  On the nationality of these terrorist elements, he said that 
they are Egyptians and their leaders abroad are recruiting some 
Egyptians and non-Egyptian under false and baseless pretexts. 
  In reply to another question about the possibility of having 
a dialogue with the terrorist groups, the interior minister 
rejected the idea of a dialogue with these terrorists groups. 
He asked: A dialogue with whom? With criminals? A dialogue 
with gangs? 
  He added that a dialogue with them is rejected because they 
are not Muslims and have no official, constitutional, or legal 
status and they are dealt with according to the law. He 
stressed his intention to continue to liquidate these elements 
and to bring them to court. 
  Hasan al-Alfi said that there are no religiously-based 
parties in Egypt and that no organization or society that is 
based on religion and practices political activity is recognized. 
  The interior minister appealed to the foreign press to 
convey 
the true picture of the situation in Egypt and to expose these 
terrorist groups' practices.

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi 
has criticized the statements issued by terrorist groups through 
foreign news agencies following any incident. He described 
these statements as a sign of bankruptcy, noting that they come 
in reaction to the constant security campaigns and the 
tightening of the noose around the terrorists. [passage omitted] 
  Al-Alfi pointed out that there were security shortcomings in 
the attack on the showroom owned by al-Sayyid Yahya, the main 
witness in the case of the [attempted assassination] of Prime 
Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. He noted that an investigation is now 
being conducted by inspection teams from the Ministry of 
Interior to determine who was responsible for the security 
shortcomings. 
  Asked if some of those who carried out the attack were 
arrested, al-Alfi asked to delay the announcement of arrests of 
any suspects, adding that the Interior Ministry will issue a 
statement when the time comes to maintain the confidentiality of 
information for the sake of the public good. 
  In response to a question on tightening security around 
citizens who give out information to security agencies, al-Alfi 
emphasized that those who give information are under protection, 
although this is done secretly. He added: If a mistake has 
been made in one area, this does not mean that mistakes will 
continue. 
  Asked about the bomb that exploded yesterday in front of the 
Central Bank branch in Ramsis Square, the interior minister said 
that it was a trivial thing done to prove that the terrorists 
are still present. 
  Asked about the security situation in Asyut, the interior 
minister stressed that the situation is completely calm there 
and that there is a security presence and that security agencies 
are constantly being modernized. The interior minister referred 
to the regrettable incident that claimed the life of Brigadier 
General 'Umar Hasan Mustafa the day before yesterday, adding 
that it happened because of a personal error by martyr Brig. 
Gen. 'Umar, who used his private car on his day off without any 
guards accompanying him. [passage omitted]

  [Text] According to sources of the Iraqi opposition abroad, 
a huge explosion occurred at the Foreign Ministry of tyrant 
Saddam's regime. According to sources inside Iraq, the 
explosion took place on Saturday [5 February] night, causing 
severe property damage and killing some of the ministry's 
employees. 
  Tyrant Saddam's regime imposed a tight cordon around the 
scene of the blast and desperately tried to prevent the news 
from reaching news agencies abroad, but eyewitnesses have 
described the explosion as breathtaking and said it was heard in 
several areas of Baghdad.

  [Text] This morning, the three terrorists who murdered 
Li'or Tubul, Ronen Qaramani, Rafi Doron, and Yehoshu'a Friedberg 
were given four consecutive life sentences each. Two of them 
were given an additional 20 years in prison for attempted 
murder. The Jerusalem District Court handed down the sentence 
after convicting them upon their own admission. 
  Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that in an 
unprecedented move, the president of the court did not allow one 
of the defendants to complete his statement before the sentence 
was issued in view of the political nature of his remarks, as 
the judge put it. After the sentencing, Qaramani's brother 
tried to attack one of the murderers, but was stopped.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>
  [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has 
announced that the health of its founder, Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, 
began to deteriorate four days ago. 
  Shaykh Yasin has been in Kefar Yona prison in occupied 
Palestine since May 1989. The Israeli Military Court sentenced 
him to life imprisonment plus 15 years. 
  The Hamas representative in Jordan, Muhammad Nazzal, told 
AL-RA'Y that Hamas received reports from the occupied 
territories saying that Shaykh Yasin's health is precarious. He 
denounced Arab and international public opinion for ignoring the 
cause of Shaykh Yasin and urged human rights organizations and 
international establishments to pressure Israel to free Shaykh 
Yasin immediately. The shaykh has spent four years in prison in 
very bad physical condition. 
  Nazzal said that delays in the trial of Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
al-Rantisi [spokesman of former Palestinian deportees in south 
Lebanon] have no legal justification, and are aimed at 
preventing him, and those who returned from Marj al-Zuhur, from 
playing their political role in confronting the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 
  Nazzal disclosed that the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, 
Hamas's military wing, and the Fatah Hawks groups coordinate 
military operations confronting Israeli occupation. 
  He said the martyrdom of Salim Muwafi, a Fatah Hawks 
commander in Gaza, a few days ago emphasized that the enemy is 
going ahead in its onslaught to liquidate all mujahidin and 
strugglers, regardless of their organizational affiliation. He 
hailed Fatah Hawks groups who announced they will continue armed 
struggle. 
  Answering a question on delaying the Doctors Union elections 
in the Gaza Strip, Nazzal said: The delay is supposed to last 
for a few days as a result of the recent martyrdom of one of 
Fatah Hawks commanders. 
  A similar delay was recently announced for elections at the 
Islamic University in Gaza following the martyrdom of 'Imad 
'Aqil, one of the 'Izz-al-Din Battalions commanders. 
  Answering a question, Nazzal said Hamas is not against a 
phased solution that restores any part of the occupied 
Palestinian land, on the condition that the Zionist entity is 
not recognized and that no part of the Palestinian land is ceded. 
  He added: The current negotiations to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement do not represent a phased solution as 
presented by the PLO in the 1970's. 
  Concluding his statement to AL-RA'Y, Nazzal said the Davos 
talks proved that the Palestinian side is the only party making 
concessions, and that delaying the signing of the agreement was 
simply a maneuver to market the new concessions made by the PLO 
leadership and to convince the Palestinian and Arab public 
opinion to accept the agreement as an important political 
achievement. 
  Nazzal expected more Palestinian concessions during the next 
PLO-Israeli talks. He said these concessions will tempt Israel 
to tighten its position on all issues negotiated during the next 
stage.

<F P=106> [Report by army affairs correspondent Eytan Rabin and Amira </F>
Hess] 
  [Text] Defense establishment and IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] elements are concerned about the emerging cooperation 
between several Fatah Hawks squads, which have rebelled against 
the local Fatah leadership in the Gaza Strip, and Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] elements. 
  A report submitted by security elements indicates that Fatah 
Hawks squads were in touch with Hamas recently about possible 
cooperation, but no agreement was signed. 
  So far, Hamas has merely provided moral support to the 
insurgent Fatah Hawks squads, but it is believed that the two 
sides will initiate joint operations at a later stage. 
  The security elements' report states that 51 Fatah fugitives 
and activists have set up several squads and rebelled against 
the organization. The activists and the fugitives, including 
some who participated in attacks on Israelis, have acquired 
increasing power which rests mainly on support from accomplices. 
  The report further indicates that the PLO-Tunis leaders have 
lost control over the Fatah Hawks squads. Even more serious, 
according to the report, is the fact that the squads have 
rebelled against the young local leadership of the Gaza Strip 
Fatah organization. 
  It is believed that the local Fatah leadership in the Strip, 
headed by Sami Abu-Samahdanah, 'Iyad al-Ashqar, Dhiyab al-Lawh, 
and Sufiyan Abu-Zayida, is also unable to control the splinter 
squads. 
  The security report asserts that several elements within the 
PLO leadership in the Strip, including fugitives, have rejected 
the authority of Fatah because of its agreement to ban attacks 
following the signing of the declaration of principles on 13 
September. 
  The report says that Fatah members who have rejected the 
organization's authority are still carrying out attacks, and in 
recent weeks, they have been involved in attacks on IDF and 
security troops. It has been further learned that the local 
leadership is also worried about the emerging cooperation. 
  In view of the intensifying Fatah Hawks activities, the 
Jordanian branch of Hamas has issued an open statement 
encouraging the squads' work and even urging their expansion. 
  The defense establishment has decided to continue the 
manhunt 
for these fugitives despite their affiliation with Fatah and 
despite the agreement that Fatah members would no longer be 
classified as fugitives. 
  "The PLO leadership in Tunis, as well as the local 
leadership, realize that the IDF will continue hunting the 
fugitives, even if they continue to protest against this," a 
security figure has stated. 
  The report also refers to the local leadership's fear of a 
wave of purges liable to be launched because of the discord -- 
which has not yet developed into a physical confrontation -- 
between peace agreement supporters and those opponents who have 
left the organization. 
  In a leaflet disseminated yesterday in Gaza, the Fatah Hawks 
claim responsibility for the assassination of three 
collaborators over the past two weeks. A photocopy of the 
"license to carry arms and ammunition" belonging to one of the 
victims was attached to the leaflet. 
  The three dead men are Salah 'Ashur from Dayr al-Balah and 
Yusuf al-Salibi from Gaza, whose bodies were discovered last 
Monday, and Muhammad Shihadah, alias al-Qaqam, from Jabalyah, 
murdered 12 days ago. 
  The leaflet contends that activities against collaborators 
are coordinated between the leadership and the Hawks, although 
it implies a controversy over this matter between the Fatah 
"military branch" and the civilian leadership, which has 
reservations about the executions because of their detrimental 
impact on society. In the leaflet, the Hawks pledge to carry 
out every order of the Yasir 'Arafat-headed leadership, adding 
at the same time: "We announce that we will punish every 
traitor and collaborator." 
  The leaflet announces that the Hawks have interrogated 
'Ashur, "a collaborator since the 1970's and one of the most 
dangerous," warning other collaborators that 'Ashur divulged 
their names during his interrogation and that "the Fatah bullets 
are not far from them. We will soon meet." 
  The Hawks leaflet further claims that Shihadah was "a member 
of the undercover units."

<F P=106> [Report by 'Amira Hess and ITIM] </F>
  [Excerpts] "Were Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and 
the Fatah Hawks really discussing the possibility of 
cooperation, the two Hamas leaders would not have rushed to tell 
the newspapers that they encouraged the Fatah Hawks to attack 
Israelis, as they did several days ago." This statement was 
made yesterday to HA'ARETZ by Fatah member Sufiyan Abu-Zayida in 
reaction to a report by security elements on the emerging 
cooperation between Fatah Hawks squads and Hamas. 
  "In their press interviews, Dr. Ibrahim Yazuri and Khalid 
al-Hindi have encouraged the Fatah Hawks to act against 
Israelis," said Abu-Zayida, the PLO liaison with the Israeli 
authorities. Yesterday he was mentioned as one of the young 
leaders who have lost control over the Hawks. "It stands to 
reason that if they meant to forge such cooperation, they would 
not run to the press with their remarks of encouragement. In my 
opinion, this is just a guess on the part of the Shin Bet." 
[passage omitted] 
  A senior officer said yesterday that the experimental period 
in which the pursuit of Fatah members was discontinued in return 
for their stopping all terrorist activity failed and therefore 
was called off. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A military spokesman for the General Command of the 
al-'Asifah Forces -- the command of the Fatah forces inside the 
occupied territories -- has stated the following: 
  Our cells operating inside the occupied homeland have 
planted 
advanced explosive charges in the Haifa chemical factory north 
of the industrial zone, which is adjacent to the Haifa oil 
refineries. 
  The charges went off at 1300 on Monday, 7 February, 1994, 
destroying the factory and setting huge fires that spread to 
neighboring factories and installations. 
  The military spokesman added that, since the operation, 
rescue and fire fighting teams, the police, and the mobile 
environment protection unit for treating dangerous materials 
have been making great attempts to place the situation under 
control, while clouds of black smoke covered the whole Gulf of 
Haifa.

  [Text] A deserted taxi cab was found near the agricultural 
village of Helez in southern Israel at noon today. The cab 
belongs to a resident of the village of Yoshivya near the town 
of Netivot named Ellan Sudri, aged 23 years. 
  Blood stains were seen on the interior and exterior of the 
cab. Several hoses were also found inside the car. The blood 
stains were sent to the laboratory for tests. Inside the car, 
signs of resistance were also detected. Police, Border Guard, 
and Israeli Defense Force units hastened to the site of the 
incident. They have started large-scale combing operations, 
using helicopters. 
  This driver disappeared at approximately 2100 yesterday, 
when 
he informed his station by radio that he was returning home. 
However, he failed to make the return trip home. The police 
began an investigation into the circumstances surrounding his 
disappearance. The police fear this driver was killed by 
terrorists. A leaflet sent to a foreign news agency signed by 
the so-called Islamic Jihad stated that a border guard policeman 
had been kidnapped and killed. The leaflet included a photograph 
of the driver's identity card, and a photograph of a policeman's 
identity card belonging to the same driver. This driver has 
been demobilized from the Border Guards Corps. 
  Police Minister Moshe Shahal has said all security agencies 
are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the 
disappearance of this driver. He indicated that search 
operations are currently under way for this driver, adding that 
the police are collecting intelligence data on the issue. 
  In a separate development, the body of a 70-year-old man has 
been found near the cooperative village of Nein in the Rehovot 
area. The Coastal Plain police have begun investigations into 
the incident. They arrested many residents of the area belonging 
to minority groups. This person is believed to have been killed 
by terrorists.

<F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Excerpts] Amman--Security authorities are questioning at 
least five people in connection with bombings at two movie 
theatres in the last two weeks. But officials are declining 
comment on whether there was any evidence to indicate that a 
single group was behind the two blasts. 
  Interior Minister Salamah Hammad confirmed the arrest of 
five 
people on Wednesday, one day after a bomb tore through the Salwa 
movie theatre in al-Zarqa, injuring two people, one of them 
seriously. 
  The minister said investigations were continuing and that 
investigators were keeping all possibilities open. Other 
sources said more arrests were made but did not disclose any 
details. 
  The Salwa blast followed a similar explosion on January 26 
at 
the Rivoli movie house in downtown Amman which injured seven 
people, one of them seriously. 
  The common features of the two bombings were that both 
occurred at establishments screening X-rated movies and the 
nature of the explosive devices were the same. In addition, the 
exact place where the bombs, described as crude homemade devices 
lacking any sophistication, was also the same--near the 
projection rooms. 
  More importantly, however, according to sources, the bombs 
were of the same type as that of devices removed and defused 
before they exploded at two liquor stores over the past six 
months. In turn, those devices appeared to have been built with 
the same technique that was used by the extremist underground 
group called Jaysh Muhammad (Muhammad's Army), the sources said. 
  "It is premature to point the finger at any specific group 
despite the common features of the explosive devices," said one 
source. "Anyone who ever worked with the Afghan Mujahidin could 
have learned the technique." [background passage on Muhammad's 
Army omitted] 
  The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of the 
Brotherhood, has denounced the January 26 bombing, saying 
violence was not the means to prevent cinemas from showing films 
that many see as incompatible with the conservative Jordanian 
society.

  [Excerpts] Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has stated that 
a group of saboteurs has recently been apprehended. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Salamah Hammad] Recently, a group or 
groups of people have been arrested. They sought to harm this 
country. They had aims, which included plans to blow up public 
places. These included the House of Representatives, 
considering it a state institution. They also planned to blow 
up places such as cinemas, video shops, and night clubs; 
assassinate a number of intellectuals and economists in this 
country; rob banks, considering them usurious establishments; 
attack police foot patrols and seize their weapons and also 
attack intelligence men; and attack public places. 
  Four crimes against supermarkets, taxi drivers, and a liquor 
store were carried out. They also committed crimes in the 
Rivoli Cinema in Amman and the Salwa Cinema in al-Zarqa', as you 
heard and as we announced. An explosive charge planted in 
Zahran Cinema in Amman was defused and did not explode. 
  Yesterday, a group of persons were arrested. They had in 
their possession two bombs intended to be detonated in Irbid, 
and another two in al-Salt. 
  This morning we received information that a bomb had been 
planted in al-Hashimiyah Square [in Amman]. All measures were 
taken, but the bomb was not found. Last night we received word 
about a bomb in the al-Nasr Cinema in al-Zarqa' and we 
investigated that this morning. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["OANA/pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Colombo, 6 Feb (LANKAPUVATH) -- The LTTE 
[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] is under tremendous pressure 
from the general public of Jaffna to lay down arms and seek 
peace with the Sri Lankan Government and enter the democratic 
process. 
  Official sources told LANKAPUVATH that according to latest 
intelligence reports, Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran has 
retreated to his 14 jungle base hideout in Weli Oya in the 
northern Mullaittivu District to avoid any contact with the 
public of Jaffna, particularly academicians and religious 
leaders who are bringing increasing pressure to bear on 
Prabhakaran to stop this wanton campaign of terrorism in which 
as many as 12,000 Sinhala, Muslim and Tamil civilians have been 
brutally slain by the LTTE. 
  In fact, the intelligence reports revealed that Prabhakaran 
was in Mullaittivu at the time the team of Catholic clergy led 
by archbishop of Colombo Most Rev. (Dr.) Nicholas Marcus 
Fernando visited Jaffna and were able to hold talks only with 
Anton Balasingham whose credibility rating is very low as he is 
used by Prabhakaran as a mouthpiece for spreading disinformation. 
  Meanwhile, a senior citizen of Jaffna, a professional, told 
LANKAPUVATH that the average man in Jaffna was not one bit 
interested in LTTE's battle cry of Eelam. All they wanted was 
an end to 10 years of suffering and to live in peace and harmony 
with their Sinhala and Muslim brethren. 
  The people of Jaffna cannot be fooled by the LTTE anymore, 
he 
said. He claimed that the multipurpose cooperatives in Jaffna 
to which the food and other essentials were shipped regularly by 
the Sri Lankan Government, were run by the LTTE who plundered 30 
percent of the essential supplies for use of the terrorist 
organisation. A further 30 percent of supplies from Colombo 
were used to feed 225,000 refugees. 
  The senior citizen said that people were now fed up with 
LTTE 
repression and described Prabhakaran's rule as a fascist 
dictatorship where people had no freedom of expression or 
movement. Anyone wanting to leave the peninsula even for a few 
days, had to provide another person as surety and Rs. [rupees] 
10,000 for an exit permit plus Rs. 500 to cross the Jaffna 
Lagoon from Sangupiddy to Kilali. 
  He said that any family wanting to leave the peninsula had 
to 
sign all their property and hand over the ownership to the LTTE 
and to pay Rs. 25,000 each for a permanent exit permit. Even 
then one member of the family was required to remain in Jaffna 
so that the LTTE will have a hold on the family wherever the 
others are and continue to extort money from them on the threat 
that the remaining members of the family would be executed if 
the Tiger demands are not met. 
  He said that all this was ample proof that the LTTE was in 
no 
way interested in the welfare of the Tamils, but a plain and 
simple brutal terrorist organisation whose leaders were using 
slogans such as Eelam to deceive the Tamils and feather their 
own nests.

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Feb (MENA)--The Sudanese opposition 
al-Ummah Party issued a statement in Cairo today holding the 
Sudanese Government fully responsible for opening the country's 
territory to terrorists and noting, in this connection, the 
Sudanese Foreign Ministry's decision to grant citizenship to 
members of all Islamic groups. 
  The party announced that the Sudanese Government is 
responsible for last Saturday's assault against the residence 
and company headquarters of a Saudi businessman living in Sudan. 
Several security personnel were injured in that incident. 
  The statement warned the Sudanese Government of the 
consequences of playing patron to terrorists.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Text] Political sources have stated that preparations are 
underway to hold a meeting between the Syrian Foreign Minister 
and the U.S. Secretary of State to discuss the removal of 
Syria's name from the list of states that support terrorism. 
The meeting will discuss the conditions which U.S. President 
Bill Clinton conveyed to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad during 
their recent meeting in Geneva. The sources said these 
conditions are: 
  1. Syria should support the U.S. efforts to fight the 
current 
of fundamentalist terrorism in the region by handing over files 
on the Iranian personalities who support this current, on Iran's 
role in giving material support for this, and on Iran's present 
contacts with some Arab personalities to intensify the 
fundamentalist terrorists' operations. 
  In this regard, the United States has asked Syria to 
disclose 
the intricate details of Iranian-Syrian relations. Clinton 
alleged that the United States has information that Syrian 
intelligence services have complete files in this connection. 
  2. Syria should halt the Palestinian factions opposing the 
peace process and turn over to Israel about 23 Palestinians 
wanted for committing serious (terrorist) incidents where many 
Israeli citizens were killed. These individuals are living 
under the protection of the Syrian regime. 
  3. Syria should halt all forms of support for the 
pro-Iranian 
Hizballah forces in Lebanon and hand over files regarding 
Hizballah's plans, the main figures behind the terrorist 
operations, and the Iranian personalities who have direct 
influence in Iran. 
  4. Syria should condemn the intifadah in the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  The sources said there are some differences between the two 
sides regarding the U.S. conditions. Contacts are underway to 
narrow these differences and bring about a meeting between the 
Syrian foreign minister and the U.S. Secretary of State.

  [Text] Istanbul, Feb 5 (AA) -- On Saturday, Syrian Foreign 
Minister Faruq al-Shar' expressed his country's concern over the 
lack of a `water sharing agreement' between Turkey, adding it 
will be a source for tension as long as such an agreement is not 
signed. [passage omitted] 
  On the terrorism issue, al-Shar' said that Damascus fully 
supports Turkey's territorial integrity, reiterating that Syria 
does not support the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
organization. 
  `Turkey's future can only be determined by its own people, 
no 
other foreign forces can decide for it,' he said, adding Syria 
denounces any kind of terrorism. 
  However al-Shar' did not qualify the terrorist PKK 
organization as `terrorist.' Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, 
who held the opening speech of the meeting, said that the 
tripartite consultation meeting was held to evaluate the latest 
situation in the region where the three countries are situated 
specially the developments in Iraq, adding it is not directed 
against any other country. 
  He said the protection of Iraq's territorial unity is as 
vital for the three countries concerned as for the whole world, 
adding the support or incentives towards separatist movements is 
unacceptable, a point also stressed by Syria and Iran. [passage 
omitted]

statements to AL-AHRAM published Wednesday, Yemeni Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah noted that charges that his

infiltration takes place secretly and without the security 
authorities' consent. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Correspondent Vadim Ogurtsov report: "There Was a Reason </F>
for the Terrorist To Get Psyched Up"] 
  [Text] Rostov-na-Donu -- The Rostov Prosecutor's Office is 
still painstakingly unraveling the extremely complex details of 
the dramatic seizure in December of a group of young hostages, 
but meanwhile in former Krasnodon a certain Chichkin, who used 
to be a miner in one of the local coal mines, took two boys and 
a nurse prisoner in a kindergarten, which he threatened to blow 
up. The situation was dangerous because the terrorist was 
shouting hysterically and would have released the pin of the 
explosive device hidden in his clothing had any attempt been 
made to challenge him. He demanded to be taken by car to 
Rostov, where an aircraft was to be made ready for him at the 
local airport. 
  During the long journey from the Ukrainian city 
representatives from both republics' security services and 
Ministries of Internal Affairs took every opportunity to 
negotiate with the terrorist. He watched over his hostages with 
constant vigilance in the ambulance that was made available to 
him. He would not remove the black stocking he was wearing on 
his head, and he threatened to pull out the pin whenever the 
situation seemed dangerous to him. In Rostov he spelled out his 
demands: $500,000 for himself, food and potties for the 
frightened and crying children, and an airliner made ready for a 
long-haul flight along the route Minsk-Kaliningrad-London-United 
States. 
  Attempts to dissuade the terrorist from carrying out his 
criminal plan came to nothing. Suspiciously, without letting go 
of one of the boys, he took a preliminary look around the 
aircraft. The group boarded the aircraft in the following 
manner: The nurse led the way with the first young hostage; the 
terrorist followed a step behind her with the other. The woman 
had already stepped off the gangway into the cabin when someone 
brusquely pulled her and the child aside. Somebody else 
shielded them on the floor from a possible explosion. At that 
very moment the criminal was "grabbed" so tightly that even if 
he had wanted to execute his desperate plan, he would not have 
been able to move and activate the charge. He was neutralized by 
officers from a special section of the Rostov Internal Affairs 
Administration Department for Combatting Organized Crime.

<F P=106> [Sergey Mostovshchikov report: "Who Is Murdered in Moscow </F>
and How. Report on Deaths During Development of Market 
Relations"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] In 1993 the landmark of 1,404 
crimes involving the violent death of various categories of 
Muscovites and visitors to the capital was reached. And this -- 
as the reader has probably already managed to calculate -- is a 
52.7-percent increase in the number of premeditated murders in 
just one year. 
  However, if the figure 1,404 is enough to make you reel in 
horror, then prepare yourself, there is worse to come. Yuriy 
Fedoseyev also has aggravated assaults leading to death in store 
for you -- 983 last year. And if you add the corpses that are 
not found straightaway and are not entirely, to be blunt, fresh 
and intact, the militia's math virtually brings us to the figure 
of 3,000, which means that around 8.2 people are now murdered 
every day in the hero city of Moscow. [passage omitted] 
  There is every indication that it is not only the militia 
that is learning, but also the people whom they are hunting 
down. I don't know about rope barriers, but, according to Yuriy 
Fedoseyev, the Moscow criminal world is now equipped with 
high-quality sniper rifles, assault rifles, grenade launchers, 
and TNT, which is apparently gradually coming into fashion. It 
has begun to be considered fashionable in the city to blow up a 
victim at his home, preferably at around 0400-0500 hours. The 
capital's defenders of law and order have already dubbed this 
the "have-a-nice-day" approach. 
  The niceness of the day is complicated for the Moscow 
Criminal Investigations Department by the fact that 
radio-controlled detonators have appeared in the city. The art 
of murdering your fellow man without leaving a trace, without 
witnesses, and an obvious motive has become near-perfect of 
late. In 1993 the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department 
cleared up only 48.2 percent of the crimes involving 
premeditated murder. [passage omitted]

told SNARK that the youth patriotic organization entering the 
Azerbaijani People's Front has appealed Geydar Aliyev to resign 
as a president. Otherwise, the organization threatens to effect 
terrorist and sabotage acts on Azerbaijan territory. 
  In this connection, the official circles in Azerbaijan do

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Political Terror Against the Rukh </F>
and Its Leaders"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian Popular Movement [NRU], Rukh, is 
consistently pursuing policies directed at the development of an 
independent Ukrainian state and its liberation from the old 
communist nomenklatura. It conducts its political line by 
staying in parliamentary opposition to the power structures that 
exist in Ukraine. This is why the Rukh has found itself under 
steady political pressure from official institutions, as well as 
from pro-presidential and pro-imperial media. 
  This is evidenced by cases of assaults on local Rukh 
organizations and the use of violence against its members, which 
has become systematic since the election campaign started. 
  The Rukh's Chernivtsi local organization was attacked twice 
over the past several weeks. The premises of Rukh's local 
organization based in Ternopol was demolished on Christmas Eve. 
The children of several leaders of Rukh's department in Odessa 
were beaten up. Unidentified attackers broke into the house of 
the Rukh organization in Kirovograd Oblast; and on 15 January, 
there was an attempt to break into an apartment belonging to Les 
Tanyuk, member of the Rukh Central Command. Colonel Serhiy 
Budko, the organization's legislative candidate, was beaten up 
in broad daylight on 17 January. Similar cases are reported 
from practically all parts of Ukraine. 
  Still unknown is the fate of Mykola Perevoznyy, Rukh leader 
in the town of Kotelvy, Poltava Oblast. About two months ago, 
"the relevant agencies" detained him without pressing any 
charges. All inquiries filed by his wife and the Rukh's local 
department remained unanswered. Zoya Kovalenko, a Rukh activist 
in the town, thinks that Mykola Perevoznyy was persecuted for 
his critical newspaper articles revealing abuses on the part of 
local government officials. One of those people, Hryhoriy 
Kostenko, a militia department chief, has already been 
registered as a candidate for people's deputy. 
  Roman Dyakovych, Rukh's legislative candidate who works in 
Khmelnik hospital, could lose his job at any time because of his 
political convictions. He was previously reinstated in his 
position by a court decision. There is also evidence that 
people are intimidated and pressured to withdraw their 
signatures collected in support of Roman Dyakovych. 
  On the night of 16 January, the premises of Rukh Secretariat 
were subjected to an armed attack. On that same night, Mykhaylo 
Boychyshyn, member of the Secretariat and cochairman of the NRU 
election headquarters, was reported missing. His whereabouts 
are still unknown. Ukrainian Television delayed broadcasting 
information about his disappearance. Law enforcement agencies 
ignored demands by the Rukh and Boychyshyn's family, and were 
slow to initiate an investigation of the case. 
  The unprecedented disappearance of one of the NRU leaders 
and 
all the above mentioned actions have a heavy political tinge and 
are directly connected with the election race in Ukraine. 
  There are certain influential political circles in our state 
which actively oppose electing Rukh representatives to the 
legislature. With the election around the corner, they resort 
to terror, trying to demoralize the democratic forces and 
intimidate their supporters, which makes the political situation 
in Ukraine even more unstable. 
  The Ukrainian Popular Movement reaffirms its resolve to 
continue fighting for an independent and democratic Ukraine, 
prosperity of its people, and their social protection in spite 
of all repressions. 
  In connection with the Boychyshyn case and other incidents, 
Rukh's Central Command instructed its leader to resume his 
participation in Supreme Council sessions. The nomenklatura 
majority in the parliament greeted Chornovil with catcalls and 
laughter. The electorate put forward Lubomyra Boychyshyn as a 
candidate for the legislature, who will run in the district of 
her missing husband. By extending this kind of support to a 
bedridden woman, Lvov residents displayed their resolve to fight 
for the electoral victory of pro-reform forces in spite of the 
flagrant pressure and political terror.

<F P=106> [Robert Stoppacher report on news conference by Austrian </F>
Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak on 10 February; place not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The Anti-Terrorism Task Force has struck again. 
A 24-year-old right-wing extremist has been arrested in 
connection with the series of letter bomb attacks. [see 
Terrorism Reports dated 15, 24, and 28 December 1993 for 
incident reporting] Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak confirmed 
this today. He did not want to disclose any details on the 
man's role. [passage omitted] 
  Reportedly, the recently-arrested man is part of the 
leadership of the terrorist group called Extraparliamentary 
Opposition Loyal to the People, with which Peter Binder and 
Franz Radl Jr are also affiliated. These two right-wing 
extremists have been imprisoned for many weeks. Loeschnak says 
that they are supposedly behind the wave of terrorism. By the 
way, the interior minister also talks for the first time of 
concrete proof against the suspects, not mere circumstantial 
evidence. 
  At any rate, right-wing extremism in Austria has altogether 
become more violent. This is also shown by the criminal 
statistics presented by the Interior Ministry, which, however, 
in general indicates a gratifying reversal of the trend. After 
years of increasing crime rates, the figures for 1993 show, for 
the first time, a slight decrease. The number of crimes and 
criminal offenses is just under 500,000, as compared to 502,000 
the year before. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Manhunt With Video Films"] </F>
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- German left-wing extremists are 
now using secretly made video films against their potential 
terrorism victims. The "black films" were produced, as the 
extremists claim themselves, at a high cost, and show "persons, 
structures, and meeting places" of political opponents, that is, 
of right-wing extremists or suspected right-wing extremists. As 
of now, it should be possible to "take them to task at any time, 
be it in their favorite restaurants or in their apartments," a 
paper of the Antifascist Action says, which the Federal Office 
for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] considers as 
belonging to autonomous groups from the Rhine-Main area who are 
ready to use violence. 
  The filmed "wanted posters" are accompanied by a topical 
militant brochure, giving details such as names, photographs, 
and addresses of the "militant fascists." In the area of 
Aschaffenburg, 23 "targets" are listed, in Frankfurt 14, in 
Hanau 7, and in Mainz 5. In addition, the lists also contain the 
car license plates of the "target persons," who must "be stood 
up to wherever they are." 
  One of the persons listed has been the target of left-wing 
extremist violence several times. After an attempted arson 
attack on his car, the perpetrators justified their attack as 
follows: "There are enough reasons to put a stop to the plans of 
such swine as.... We will get them all. Antifascist resistance 
must not peter out with slogans and limit itself to pure 
symbolism." 
  Acts of violence by the autonomous groups are not limited to 
the Rhine-Main area. In Berlin, too, people have been called to 
participate in "Volxsport" [distortion of "Volkssport," which 
means "popular sport"], which is a synonym often used in the 
milieu to mean attacks. "Wanted posters" were also printed by 
the Hanover paper RAZZ "to serve as a basis for all antifascist 
forces who have recognized the necessity of directly combatting 
and politically isolating neofascism." 
  In the view of the BfV, a new wave of violence in Germany's 
extremist scene threatens because of the mutual publication of 
"political hit lists" -- at the end of last year, the neo-Nazi 
brochure EINBLICK published the names of "anti-German and 
antinationalist forces." 
  The so-called Revolutionary Cells are also involved in that. 
In a position paper, their women's group -- Red Zora -- has now 
committed itself for the first time again after a five-year 
break to continuing the "armed struggle." The "destruction of 
installations, buildings, and objects" is an "important, 
indispensable part of revolutionary women's policy," the 38-page 
brochure says. In a "practical handbook" the activists inform 
the reader about, among other things, the handling of 
explosives, the building of incendiary charges, and the forging 
of documents. Whoever does not seriously decide in favor of 
militant actions and armed struggle, Red Zora admonishes, does 
not recognize the dimension of the opponent and of the apparatus 
of power. Thus, the terrorists recommend, for instance, 
"punitive actions" against rapists' lawyers. 
  According to the BfV, more than 28,000 persons in Germany 
belong to left-wing extremist organizations and groups. 
Autonomous groups that are ready for violence and that have 
more than 5,000 followers, register a steady influx of new 
members. The mobilization potential amounts to a further 
several thousand persons.

  [Text] One of the ETA members most wanted by the Spanish 
police was arrested today in France. Jesus Garcia Corporales, 
alias Gitanillo, was arrested this morning in Hendaye by the 
French border police. He was carrying false identity papers and 
a pistol. His partner Maria Isabel Fernandez was arrested with 
him. 
  During the same police operation, but in Biarritz, another 
woman, Agnes Cerlot, was also arrested. She is a French 
national and five years ago she was convicted for cooperation 
with ETA member Josu Ternera. 
  Garcia Corporales has been identified as a member of ETA's 
Madrid Commando. In April last year, his picture, along with 
those of Jose Javier Ariskuren, alias Josetxu, and Maria Soledad 
Iparraguirre, alias Sole or Elisabet, was on a poster put up in 
thousands of places and public buildings throughout Spain.

<F P=106> [Selin Caglayan, Faruk Balikci, and Saban Sevinc report: </F>
"The PKK Is Reluctant To Leave Zhalah"] 
  [Excerpt] A team from HURRIYET has succeeded in traveling 
to the Zhalah Camp in northern Iraq, which was bombed by Turkey 
last week. The Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] militants were 
reluctant to show the current situation of their camp to the 
correspondents. However, they claimed that only seven of their 
colleagues were killed in the air attacks and noted: "We are 
not afraid of bombs. As you have observed, we are still here in 
the camp." 
  We reached the vicinity of the camp with great difficulty. 
We arrived in an area which had many craters created by 
exploding bombs. That area was 500 meters from the Zhalah Camp. 
One of the PKK militants who blocked our way identified himself 
as the person in charge of the camp. He claimed that the 
Turkish newspapers are being used as an instrument and said that 
we could not enter their camp. The correspondents said: "If 
you claim that the Turkish Government is lying, then you should 
allow us to enter to determine the true state of affairs." 
However, the PKK militants were determined not to allow us into 
their camp, which had been destroyed by the military aircraft. 
  Two buildings close to the entrance of the camp seemed to be 
intact. However, the main camp was hidden deep in the canyon. 
The PKK militants refused to show us the results of the bombing 
raids. 
  Although the PKK militants claimed that no damage was caused 
to the camp, a resident of Shele village, which is near the 
Zhalah Camp, said: The Turkish aircraft dropped many bombs. It 
was like hell. Even Saddam Husayn was not bombed by the United 
States to that extent. I saw buildings collapse." He also said 
that he was in the camp when the Turkish aircraft attacked. 
  It has been ascertained that the bombing of the camp 
frightened nearby villagers a lot. However, residential areas 
and civilians around the camp were unharmed except for some 
individuals who were smuggling contraband goods on mules. The 
journalists did not observe any damage in the villages around 
the camp. 
  The PKK militants claimed that the Turkish aircraft dropped 
their bombs from an altitude of 20,000 meters [as published] to 
stay out of range of their antiaircraft guns. They also claim 
that they shot down two aircraft, but were unable to describe 
exactly where they crashed or to provide any evidence to confirm 
their claim. 
  Several Kurdish sources in northern Iraq have said: "The PKK 
militants have not been completely evicted. Although 
significant damage has been caused in the camp, the PKK 
militants are still there. However, they are demoralized. The 
air attack was a very serious deterrent measure." 
  It has been ascertained that one of the villagers, who 
transported goods from Iran to northern Iraq on mules, was 
wounded. The air operation caused significant anxiety in 
northern Iraq. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Numan Ucar, alias Mahir, the </F>
commander of the ARGK's -- People's Liberation Army of 
Kurdistan -- Zhalah camp in Iraq, by Behcet Avsar, in Cologne; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Avsar] What were the aims and results of the 
operation launched against Zhalah? 
  [Ucar] The operation was the most comprehensive air attack 
against us. Contrary to claims by the Turkish Government, 
Zhalah plays no role in "training and sending guerrillas to 
Turkey." The reason for exaggerating the importance of the 
Zhalah camp, which has a role of its own, is the impasse in the 
war. The aim is to create the impression that our struggle does 
not come from inside Turkey, but from abroad. [passage omitted] 
  [Avsar] Is it true that the leaders' headquarters and 
communications room were destroyed? 
  [Ucar] Our radio broadcasts and wireless communications are 
continuing uninterrupted. As for the destruction of leading 
cadres: The PKK's [Kurdish Workers Party] leading cadres never 
stay together in the same region or spot. They are in areas 
were fighting is taking place. Besides, the PKK's leading 
cadres exist in every locality where we are active. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Avsar] Why was Zhalah selected for the raid? Did Zhalah 
take the place of al-Biqa'? 
  [Ucar] [passage omitted] Recently, they tried to divert 
attention from the struggle inside the country by stepping up 
the propaganda about the Zhalah camp. By claiming to have 
destroyed Zhalah, which they asserted has supplanted al-Biqa', 
they actually aimed to shore up their image before the 
elections. Zhalah camp can never supplant Mahsum Korkmaz 
Academy [the PKK's camp in the al-Biqa' valley]. It has assumed 
no such function. [passage omitted] 
  [Avsar] Will you respond to this operation? 
  [Ucar] Our war, with all the attacks launched so far, has 
given the necessary reply. We have no intention of making a 
special reply. We will respond by perpetuating, developing, and 
intensifying our war. [passage omitted] 
  [Avsar] Reportedly, other operations are also taking place 
near Kanimasi and troops have been brought to Dahuk. 
  [Ucar] We have some information in this regard. We have 
received reports that tanks and troops have been massed in 
Kanimasi and that the Democratic Party of Kurdistan will 
participate in these operations. We have made preparations to 
retaliate.

  [Text] Botan (KURD-A) -- The commander of the main 
headquarters of ARGK [People's Liberation Army of Kurdistan] 
issued a statement on the casualty figures for the month of 
January. 
  It noted that despite attacks by the state forces, ARGK 
stepped up its operations and expanded the struggle for the 
liberated areas. 
  According to these figures, 371 soldiers, 14 of them 
officers, and 63 village guards were killed in January. ARGK 
lost 49 guerrillas killed and 31 injured. 
  The statement said that the state has increased its attacks 
to force the city and village dwellers in every region, 
particularly in regions where the war has intensified, to 
abandon their homes and submit to the authorities, and is 
resorting to coercion and torture to force people to become 
village guards. 
  The statement said: "The state has unleashed the special 
military forces on the people. They abduct innocent people from 
their homes and murder them under torture, cut off their heads 
and throw them on the sidewalks, and kill the patriotic clerics 
and throw their bodies from helicopters." 
  Pointing out that the state regards 1994 as a crucial year 
for its survival, the statement gave the following ARGK casualty 
figures for January: 
  -- In operations carried out in 193 separate spots, 13 being 
road checks, some 371 soldiers, 14 of them officers, were 
killed; 233 soldiers, nine of them officers, were injured; 63 
village guards were killed and 56 others were injured; 54 
agents, policemen, and members of counter-guerrilla 
organizations were killed and 47 others injured; some of the 50 
village guards and their relatives, who were collaborating with 
the state, were detained and released after interrogation, while 
others are still being interrogated. 
  -- It reported that 49 guerrillas died and 31 were injured 
during these operations. 
  -- It stated that during these operations, 29 rifles, 71 
pistols, one grenade launcher, one semi-automatic rifle, 3,000 
various types of bullets, 1,221 magazines, 57 mines, six 
rockets, three wireless kits, three binoculars, 39 million 
Turkish lira, and 240 sheep have been confiscated from the state 
forces during these same operations. 
  -- It claimed that two warplanes, three helicopters, four 
tanks, four police armored cars, and 24 other vehicles were 
destroyed and put out of action during these operations. 
  -- It noted that the state evacuated two garrisons which 
could not be defended against the guerrilla attacks. Seven 
schools and four police buildings, which were being used as 
military headquarters, were burned down. 
  -- It indicated that following operations against the 
village 
guards, the guards in six villages laid down their arms en 
masse, and 68 village guards in various other villages also did 
so. 
  -- It was claimed that protests, demonstrations, and marches 
were organized in 17 different localities with the participation 
of thousands of people to protest the state's special warfare 
policy and measures.

  [Excerpt] Ankara -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' 
this weekend assured Ankara that his country has clamped down on 
the activities of Turkey's Kurdish separatists and will not 
allow any terrorist leaders to shelter in its territories, his 
Turkish counterpart Hikmet Cetin said on Sunday (6 February). 
  Cetin told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS that the Syrian Foreign 
Minister also indicated that Damascus was in touch with Lebanon 
on this issue. 
  "Minister al-Shar' unequivocally said that they are not 
supporting the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party)," Cetin said. "He 
added that they would never allow their territories to be used 
by the separatists." 
  The Turkish Foreign Minister said his Syrian counterpart had 
even proposed to increase cooperation between the security 
organizations of both countries and organize more frequent 
meetings. 
  Developments in neighboring Iraq, Kurdish activities and 
regional waters were the highlights of a tripartite summit held 
in Istanbul on Saturday between the foreign ministers of Turkey, 
Syria and Iran. 
  The meeting resulted in a declaration of support for the 
continuation of Iraqi sovereignty, a mutual condemnation of 
terrorism, and a Turkish rejection of Syrian efforts for a 
water-use agreement for the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. Syria 
said a formal agreement on the rivers, which al-Shar' described 
as "international waters," was needed to avoid escalating the 
dispute. 
  "But I explained how sensitive Turkish public opinion was 
with regard to terrorist activities, and the impressions that 
are imbedded in Turkish public opinion about Syria in this 
context," Cetin said. 
  In his talks with al-Shar', the Turkish Foreign Minister 
suggested that doing away with this impression was one of the 
conditions for a better dialogue between the two countries, 
including on the subject of "regional waters." 
  Cetin and al-Shar' met for talks on Friday when the Syrian 
foreign minister arrived in Turkey. They also met immediately 
after Saturday's three-way talks. 
  The assurances al-Shar' gave Cetin in bilateral talks were 
in 
line with remarks he made during a press conference on Saturday. 
He said Syria did not support "any acts which violated the 
sovereignty of Turkey," and strongly denied allegations that 
Damascus was supporting PKK terrorism. 
  Diplomatic sources noted that al-Shar' appeared to be 
sincere 
in his remarks related to Ocalan, the PKK and terrorism, and 
that Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati and his 
delegation had also approached Turkey in friendly fashion. 
Cetin said he had observed "an atmosphere of understanding" on 
the Iranian side and repeated that Turkey would cooperate to 
"heal the wounds" that had arisen from the adverse effects of a 
recent Turkish air operation in northern Iraq during which nine 
Iranians were killed. 
  The tripartite summit and the change in atmosphere observed 
in Istanbul, said one official, who asked not to be identified, 
indicated a change in attitude by both countries, and implied 
that there could be better cooperation between the three 
capitals in the future on the subject of combating the PKK. 
Turkish officials believe al-Shar's "guarantee" to Ankara is 
highly significant, but added that this indicates that a change 
in tactics and alliances by the PKK should also be expected. 
Equally important is the noteworthy attitude of Iran over the 
January 28 air raid by Turkey on a major PKK training base in 
northern Iraq, they say. 
  Although nine Iranians were killed and a further 19 were 
wounded in the air raids -- reportedly due to shrapnel from a 
bomb which exploded in mid-air -- the official Iranian reaction 
was next to nothing. 
  Turkey now expects both countries to give more concrete 
assurances to Ankara, and wants promises made concerning the 
fight against terrorism to be kept. [passage omitted on recent 
air raid on Zhalah Camp]

<F P=106> [Kathy Evans report: "Radical Time-Bomb Under British </F>
Islam"] 
  [Text] It is a wet Saturday night in Ilford's shopping 
centre and groups of excited Muslim teenagers are pouring into 
the town hall. The bouncers at the door, sporting Afghan caps 
and urban guerrilla outfits, beam at the turnout. 
  The meeting, to discuss the Arab-Israel peace accord, has 
been called by the most influential of Britain's new radical 
Islamic groups, the Hizb-ut-Tahrir or Liberation Party. 
  There is only a sprinkling of whites in the audience, mostly 
girlfriends and the cranks who turn up at every political 
meeting going. The evening kicks off with a warning from the 
platform against "the Jews, policemen and the spies present from 
the Western media." All eyes turn to the Guardian reporter 
sitting unveiled in the female section as the chairman says: 
"Don't speak to them." 
  As the speeches get underway, the audience in the Essex town 
hall listens with rapt attention to a rambling three-hour 
outpouring of hatred of the West, Arab governments, Israel, 
democracy and any form of kafr or heathen authority. The 
teenagers eat every word. 
  "It will be better for the Jews to become Muslims if they 
want to live in peace in tbe land of Muslims," says the party's 
deputy leader, Farid Qassim. 
  In the daytime, Qassim works as a town planner, but at night 
he is teaching young Muslims about their "enemies." 
  The Jews, he says, are the most powerful force in Britain. 
"Who signed the GATT agreement for Britain? Leon Brittan, a 
Jew. Who signed for the Americans? Another Jew." 
  The audience jump from their seats, crying God is Great and 
shaking their fists. 
  From the female section, a gloved hand goes up. Ilford-born 
Shazia, swathed in black, her face totally covered, asks how 
British Muslims can show their commitment to the jihad or holy 
war for which Qassim has called. 
  "There is no such thing as British Muslims. There are only 
Muslims," he replies. 
  The new radical parties, of which Hizb-ut-Tahrir is the 
fastest growing, are urging Britain's Muslims to think again 
about the ideals which have governed their lives for three 
generations. During those years, most have focused on securing 
economic prosperity, a place in society, while preserving their 
way of life. 
  Now the radical groups are arguing against integration. They 
say that British Muslims are a part not of British society but 
of the Islamic ummah -- or world community -- and must be fully 
involved in the struggle against Western "oppression." 
  Officials of the Commission for Racial Equality warn that 
the 
radical groups are planting a time bomb under harmony between 
Muslims and British society. 
  The radicals are conducting a two-pronged offensive. They 
are challenging the managements of Britain's mosques by making 
humiliating public criticisms of the local imams' sermons. And 
Hizb-ut-Tahrir has taken over nearly all the Muslim student 
societies at London University colleges and campuses in other 
areas where Muslims form a large part of the community. 
  This new fervour has a distinctly Middle Eastern flavour and 
has challenged the hold of Asian groups on militant circles. A 
number of the new groups have direct links with radical 
organisations fighting to overthrow Arab governments. 
  According to one liberal Muslim journalist, Ehsan Massoud of 
Q News, Hizb-ut-Tahrir says Islam is the answer to all problems. 
"It is very attractive to young people, this pre-packaged 
Islam, particularly for those young Muslims who want to break 
out of the `biraderi' (clan) politics which dominate the society 
of their parents." 
  Their challenge to the establishment occurs at a time when 
many young British Muslims are wondering about their future in a 
Europe which has allowed the massacre of thousands of Bosnian 
Muslims and the cancellation of Algerian democracy, and is now 
enforcing what they see as an inadequate peace formula on 
Palestinian Muslims. Such issues preoccupy liberals too. "We've 
been here for only 30 years, but the Bosnian Muslims have been 
in Europe for 500 years. They wanted to be Europeans. So what 
hopes are there for my future?" asked Massoud. 
  Racial problems also harden support for the radical groups. 
"No matter how much I want to be British, I never will be 
because of my brown skin. I used to see everything as blacks 
versus whites, but now I see the struggle as Muslims against 
non-Muslims," said one Birmingham Muslim, a recent recruit to a 
radical organisation. 
  A Birmingham psychiatrist, Dr Farouk Hashimi, said he 
believed the radical groups were providing many young Muslims 
with an identity. "Instead of rituals which they can learn at 
the mosque, the radical groups function as clubs, providing 
support, friendship. They give them an identity which British 
society hasn't." 
  Islamic centres are proliferating. Most, particularly those 
centred around mosques, are harmless religious study circles and 
community groups, with links to local councils and British 
political parties. 
  A recent study by Derby University turned up some 1,400 
Islamic organisations operating in this country, but the 
academics believe that there may be as many as 4,000. 
  Liberal Muslims say a climate of fear is growing in 
Britain's 
estimated 1,000 mosques as the fight for spiritual supremacy 
between liberals and radicals intensifies. Many imams and 
mosque officials say they feel besieged. 
  Liberal imams say that when they refuse Hizb-ut-Tahrir 
permission to speak at their mosques, they become the target of 
campaigns by activists. 
  One elderly imam from west London, who accompanied me to the 
Hizb-ut-Tahrir gathering, begged me not speak to him during the 
meeting. 
  "You will get me into trouble with them and I don't want 
that," he said. "I have to deal with them in my community and I 
cannot go against them. Nobody can. I'm only going to the 
meeting to be seen. I don't agree with their views at all, 
there's too much hate in them. But you can't fight them." 
  Young liberal Muslims say much of the blame for the inroads 
of the radical groups must be laid on the Muslim establishment. 
  "They are operating the mosques as though they were still in 
Karachi," complained Ehsan Massoud. "We want better educated 
imams with more modern views, and more say in the management. 
But they won't let us in." 
  One young radical described the present management 
committees 
of mosques as "groups of local supermarket millionaires in the 
pay of Saudi Arabia." 
  A top demand by young Muslims is for sermons in English. 
They complain that the imams imported from Pakistan and the 
Middle East are often ill-qualified for the job and do not speak 
English. 
  "I want to see the mosques more open to women. Many of the 
mosques ban women, and this is a Pakistani tradition, not a 
British one," Massoud said. 
  Young Muslims also want their mosques to operate centres, 
providing advice on job problems, addiction or how to deal with 
social services. Imams should function more as counsellors and 
be less remote, the young Muslims say.... 
  One suggestion is wider British training for imams. At 
present, there are only two main training centres. One, in 
Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, offers the same education as that 
available on the Indian subcontinent. The other is the Muslim 
College in Ealing, which by contrast also offers courses in 
Engiish and history and training in counselling and dealing with 
government departments and courts. However, most of its students 
have been foreigners because no assistance is available for 
British Muslims. 
  Another necessity, liberal Muslims say, is to establish a 
Muslim version of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, 
allowing the Muslim community to promote its interests with one 
voice. They say the lack of such a body has allowed radicals to 
corner the agenda. 
<H5>  `Purify Every Inch' </H5>
  The following extracts are taken from Hizb-ut-Tahrir 
leaflets: 
  Islam forbids you and forbids any Muslim from pledging their 
allegiance to America, Russia, Britain or France or any other 
disbelieving country... Allah has also forbidden the believers 
from taking the disbelievers as intimates and telling them their 
secrets and befriending them, for these disbelievers only seek 
to bring harm to the believers. 
  The British establishment, its Government, its institutions, 
its education system, its media, will never be satisfied with us 
until they take us away from our religion of Islam. 
  Muslims are sinful if they allow the disbelieving Jews to 
continue occupying the land of Palestine. They will not be 
relieved of this sin until they exterminate the Jewish authority 
over it, and liberate it, as well as purifying every inch from 
the filth of the occupying Jews. 
  The idea of a democratic society is deceptive, dangerous and 
unworkable. The party considers it is haram (forbidden) to 
establish or participate in parties which call for capitalism, 
socialism, secularism, nationalism or any religion other than 
Islam. 
  We are surrounded by a sea of kafr (disbelief). Kafr 
thoughts, practices and kafr systems of life. 
  The Muslim ummah (community) has been seduced, tricked and 
subverted into a disastrous friendship with the kafr, the result 
of which has been the abandonment of our educational nexus for 
theirs, our moral nexus for theirs, our governmental nexus for 
theirs, our judiciary nexus for theirs, so that our 
anthropological distinctness has been submerged and eradicated 
until all that is allowed to remain is a romantic appraisal of 
our Islamic past in Museums of Mankind and other Jew-designated 
mortuaries of wisdom. 
  From an unidentified leaflet in verse, distributed outside 
the Regent's Park mosque in central London: Do something to 
prove that on your shoulders there stands a head not a piece of 
cheese. 
  Throw a stone, trigger a bomb, plant a mine, hijack a plane, 
do not ask how.

  An unnamed reporter for Islamabad's THE NEWS describes his

between 17 and 23 January. 
  The Thai deputy foreign minister said he "could not 
confirm" a foreign news agency report that World Trade Center 
bombing suspects are in Thailand. 
<H5>  Egypt </H5>
  On 7 February, the Islamic Group (al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah) 
issued its "final warning" to foreigners to leave Egypt. The 
group also took credit for a bomb that exploded in front of 
Egypt's Central Bank on the same day, and called on Egyptians to 
withdraw their money from national banks within two weeks. 
<H5>  Israel/Palestinians </H5>
  Al-Quds clandestine radio reported an al-'Asifah Forces 
statement claiming that the forces destroyed a Haifa chemical 
factory on 7 February. 
  Two Iraqi media sources reported that the Jordanians 
arrested several Palestinians who planned to assassinate PLO 
head 'Arafat during his visit to Amman. A source from the

  A Citizens Alliance of Serbia statement said that "three 
skinheads" kidnapped Veljko Dzakula, a former official in the

  Syrian diplomat Nabil Sharitah told a Berlin court that he

  [Text] Speaking to reporters, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin 
Phitsuwan said he could not confirm the report by a foreign news 
agency that the suspects in the bombing of the World Trade 
Center [WTC] are hiding in Thailand. Surin said he did not know 
where the agency got its information. The National Security 
Council is checking the report. If this is true, it will give 
Thailand a bad reputation. The Foreign Ministry will make 
clarifications later. 
  [Begin Surin recording, in progress] ...U.S. Government 
authorities in Thailand have confirmed to me that they have no 
information on this matter -- no proof, no evidence. They 
themselves know nothing about it. They do not know who the 
source of the report is or how reliable it is. Therefore, we 
will have to check on it. We cannot remain idle; still, we 
cannot take the report at face value because there has been no 
confirmation. We have only read this in newspapers that quote 
sources and make headlines about it. [end recording]

  [Text] Karachi -- Mir Aimal Kansi, 30, a suspect wanted in 
connection with the shooting at the CIA Headquarters in Langley, 
Virginia, was seen in Sehwan between January 17 to 23. Kansi is 
one of the `10 most wanted' people in the United States. 
  This correspondent, who happened to be in Sehwan for a 
visit, 
saw a strange, clean-shaven, fair and tall person and recognised 
him immediately as Aimal Kansi. Pictures of Kansi have appeared 
on wanted posters all over the world. However, neither this 
correspondent not Kansi introduced themselves to each other. 
  Between puffs of hashish, the person who stared at the Indus 
Hotel of Sehwan, where the shrine of Qalandar Lal Shahbaz and a 
"Kafi" of a Pashtoon Seth (businessman) are situated, said that 
he was on a visit to the shrine of the Sufi mystic. 
  He said that he was in the transport businesses in Karachi, 
however, he refused to give his residential address in that 
city. "The whole world is my home," he said when asked about his 
permanent abode. 
  Speaking in pidgin Urdu and occasionally in fluent English, 
Kansi said that his original village was near Zhob in 
Balochistan but he had spent most of his life in the United 
States and Germany. 
  After the firing incident, the American Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) had recovered an AK-47 assault rifle from an 
apartment where Kansi used to live with his friends. The FBI 
report said the rifle was the same as that used in the shooting. 
The report also stated that Kansi had no criminal record and 
that his neighbours generally thought him to be a normal person 
who posed no threat to anyone. 
  The Fairfax Country Police of Virginia and the FBI had 
issued 
warrants against Kansi, after the firing, charging him with the 
shooting on January 25 that occurred during the morning rush 
hour traffic just outside the CIA headquarters in Langley, 
Virginia. Two CIA personnel were killed and three others were 
injured in the bizarre shooting for which no motive has been 
established. 
  In February last year a team from the FBI had come to 
Pakistan and along with Pakistani officials, raided some of the 
houses of the people who belonged to the Kansi tribe of Quetta 
in an attempt to arrest the accused. The raids, however, failed 
as the family informed the officials that Kansi had left for the 
U.S. a couple of days back. 
  The manhunt for Kansi led to a dead-end. Finally the U.S. 
authorities placed a reward of $100,000 for information leading 
to the arrest of Mir Aimal Kansi. 
  "I was operated upon twice in the States because of 
excessive 
drinking. That is why I have given up alcohol," Kansi said, 
surrounded by some of the Malangs (spiritually intoxicated 
followers) of Sher Baaz Qalandar, who were sharing [word 
indistinct] of hashish, Kansi showed me his [word indistinct] 
and said, "I was, first, comforted with hashish in Germany by my 
girlfriend and since then, I feel that anybody who does not 
experience the joy of smoking hashish cannot enjoy life." Thick 
clouds of smoke swirled around his tough face. 
  "This person takes hashish worth Rs [Rupees] 100 daily," 
said 
a bearer of the hotel about Kansi, when asked how much hashish 
he took in a day. 
  Kansi also said that his father was an army officer "But now 
I am all alone." 
  When he was very high Kansi opened up and displayed his 
feelings. he laughingly requested: "My friends, now I feel very 
alone. Please make arrangements for my wedding." A servant at 
the hotel told THE NEWS that the person we were talking about 
did not meet anybody during his week-long stay in Sehwan. 
  "I visit the shrine of the Qalandar because I feel a certain 
peace there. I have hashish and Khang with the Malangs sitting 
inside the shrine," Kansi said. 
  He, however, avoided any other discussion about the United 
States other than references to his girlfriends and hashish 
smoking. This correspondent also did not show any eagerness 
about anything because this could have led to some suspicion on 
the part of Kansi. 
  Kansi was very impressed by the quality of the hashish 
available in Sehwan. "If you guys were in Germany with this 
quality of hashish, I swear, the girls would be crazy about you." 
  After this chance encounter with Kansi, he disappeared from 
the hotel and the town. Despite efforts by this correspondent to 
trace him again he was never seen in the vicinity of the town. 
  Aimal Kansi had gone to the U.S. from Pakistan and was 
working as a courier with a private company. 
  A recent report from Bangkok also said that the police's 
special branch teams had received information from Washington 
that Kansi, had slipped into Thailand in mid-December to hide in 
the network of guerillas and criminal gangs operating there. 
  The Thai police, on the information, have circulated wanted 
posters for the arrest of three men -- Kansi, Mohammad Farooq 
and Ramsi Ahmad Yusuf. The latter two are suspects in the World 
Trade Centre bombing case. 
  The wanted posters offer $2 million for the information 
leading to the arrest of suspects.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Nabil Sharitah, a 43-year-old 
Syrian diplomat, today denied having transported the explosives 
used in an attack on the Maison de France [French cultural 
center in West Berlin]. 
  Testifying to the 29th Criminal Bench of Berlin Regional 
Court, Sharitah, who was hidden from the view of journalists and 
the public by a curtain, admitted that on 25 August 1983 he gave 
explosives stored at the Syrian Embassy in East Berlin to 
46-year-old terrorist, Johannes Weinrich, only a few hours 
before the attack on the French cultural center on 
Kurfuerstendamm. 
  Sharitah, who was third secretary of the Syrian Embassy at 
the time and in charge of security, claims he learned of the 
purpose for which the terrorist needed the explosives only after 
the attack. The witness confirmed that the ambassador had 
assigned him to look after Johannes Weinrich and other 
terrorists. The ambassador had acted on instructions from the 
Syrian Foreign Ministry. 
  At the start of his testimony, the diplomat, who recently 
gave himself up to the German authorities, said he hopes the 
case will not become a trial of his country. Syria had nothing 
to do with the attack on the Maison de France. 
  The defendant, 51-year-old former Stasi [GDR Ministry for 
State Security] Lieutenant Colonel Helmut Voigt, is charged with 
having been an accessory to murder and to the explosives attack 
on the Maison de France. He is accused of having arranged for 
25 kilos of explosives, which the terrorists had temporarily 
stored at the Syrian Embassy before the attack, to be handed 
over to Weinrich. 
  One person was killed and 23 were injured, some seriously, 
in 
the bomb attack.

  [Text] Two British MPs have been kidnapped in Somalia, the 
Foreign Office said today. 
  Mark Robinson, Tory MP for Somerton and Frome, and Tony 
Worthington, Labour MP for Clydebank and Milngavie, were taken 
hostage along with an Action Aid employee. 
  The Action Aid employee is believed to be Jeff Chinnock. 
They were taken in Northwest Somalia near a place called 
Erigavo some time last night. 
  A spokeswoman at Worthington's office told Reuters: "I can 
confirm the reports. We have heard this morning that Tony is 
well." She said the two were on a fact-finding tour of Somalia 
with the charity Action Aid. "I believe they were kidnapped 
yesterday. We do not know who is holding them," she said. 
  The Foreign Office spokesman said he believed an Action Aid 
employee "was also involved" but could give no details. "We are 
in close touch with our ambassador in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) who 
is speaking to local elders," said the spokesman. There had 
been no ransom demand, he added. The British embassy in 
neighbouring Ethiopia also has responsibility for Somalia. 
  The Foreign Office believe the three had been taken in a 
dispute between rival clansmen. The British Embassy in Addis 
Ababa has been assured the men are not in any danger. They were 
on a trip to look at work by the charity Action Aid in the 
region when they were taken.

  [Text] [Announcer] Within the last half hour it's been 
confirmed that two British MP's have been kidnapped in Somalia. 
The MP's are Mark Robinson, a Conservative member for Somerton 
and Frome, and Tony Worthington, the Labour member for Clydebank 
and Milngavie. They were visiting Somalia with the charity 
Action Aid -- first reports suggest they were seized in the past 
48 hours, along with a woman journalist. She was subsequently 
released unharmed. And on the line from Nairobi we have Roger 
Hearing, our correspondent. Roger, what can you tell us? 
  [Hearing] Well, I've spoken to the president of Somaliland, 
the self-declared republic, which contains the area where these 
MP's were visiting and where they were kidnapped. He told me 
that in fact these people had gone to an area near Erigavo in 
the northeast corner of the republic, they had gone to an area 
called (Mait) which is known apparently for kidnappings by 
militia gunmen in the area, and against his advice apparently 
had gone there with Action Aid and been kidnapped. He could 
confirm that. 
  [Announcer] And is the UN in a position to do anything about 
it? 
  [Hearing] The UN has very few troops in that area at all. 
They carry out a policy of avoiding the area of Somaliland -- 
this self-declared, apparently illegal republic -- and have 
really kept their presence there down to officials. The 
president, however, told me that he was himself declaring an 
ultimatum to these people, he was now sending a plane -- he 
chartered a plane with 10 elders of the same clan as the people 
who had kidnapped the MP's, and that he himself would, if they 
didn't release them within 24 hours, send a force, including 
these technical, these armored vehicles they use in Somalia, to 
get them back by force if necessary. 
  [Announcer] Any clues as to why they were kidnapped, any 
sign 
of demands? 
  [Hearing] Kidnapping in Somalia is very much a matter of 
money. They would have known that these people were important 
figures, visiting foreign dignitaries, and money is to be made 
if you have guns in Somalia and there is very little law and 
order to keep people from kidnapping. So I think money is 
almost certainly the motive.

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, Alison Little and Alison Cameron, PRESS </F>
ASSOCIATION] 
  [Text] The two British MPs kidnapped along with a charity 
worker by armed clansmen in Somalia have been released, the 
Foreign Office said today. 
  Mark Robinson, 47, Tory MP for Somerton and Frome and a 
former minister, and Tony Worthington, 52, Labour MP for 
Clydebank and Milngavie, were taken on Wednesday night with 
Action Aid external relations manager Jeff Chinnock. 
  The MPs were abducted near Erigavo, northwest Somalia, 
during 
a week-long fact-finding mission in the Horn of Africa country 
wracked by famine and bloody feuds between local warlords. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We can confirm that they 
are at the Action Aid office in Erigavo and we understand they 
will fly out tomorrow." 
  The spokesman said it was too dark to consider flying the 
released men out tonight.

  [Text] Djibouti, 9 Feb (AFP) -- Yesterday afternoon, a 
Boeing 737 of the Ethiopian Airlines company, which was on an 
internal flight, was hijacked to Djibouti by two people who 
finally gave themselves up to the Djibouti authorities, after 
releasing the 113 people on board the plane, it was learned from 
airport sources. 
  The plane, which was operating a flight between Bahr-Dar 
(western Ethiopia) and Addis Ababa, landed at Djibouti 
International Airport around 1545, where after nearly four hours 
of negotiations the 105 passengers and eight crew members were 
released. The hijackers, who are said to be Ethiopians of 
Amhara origin, agreed to release their hostages and surrender 
after they were assured of being given political asylum, it was 
learned from reliable sources. 
  The negotiations were led on the Djibouti side by Interior 
Minister Harbi Farah Idris and Transport Minister Ahmed Waberi 
in the presence of the Red Cross representative in Djibouti. 
The Ethiopian ambassador to Djibouti also closely followed the 
negotiations at the airport, the same sources said. The media 
was kept out of the meeting and the Djibouti authorities 
maintained a total blackout on the affair until it ended. The 
plane was expected to leave the Djibouti airport around 2100 for 
Addis Ababa with all the 113 passengers and crew members.

<F P=106> [Report by Nick Olivari] </F>
  [Excerpts] In the main street of Ottosdal, the Vierkleur 
[flag of the former Transvaal Republic, now used by right-wing 
groups] was flying high this week. The Western Transvaal 
farming town lies in the heart of an area that has seen at least 
29 sabotage attempts on train lines, ANC offices, power pylons 
and private property in the past two months. [passage omitted] 
[see Selected Video Reports section for accompanying video 
footage] 
  This week, intelligence sources said the rightwingers 
responsible for the sabotage campaign that has included targets 
in the PWV [Pretoria Witwatersrand Vereeniging] area, the Free 
State, and the Western Transvaal, had clearly modeled themselves 
on the IRA. Using cells of only one or two members, they are 
completely independent and operate without orders. 
  ANC organiser Moses Mothupi said Wednesday's attack on the 
organisation's offices in Letsopa was a retaliatory raid for the 
distribution of ANC election posters the week before. 
Neighbours said they neither heard nor saw anything of the 
blast, though several residents had heard rumours of a 
mysterious white minibus cruising the township streets the night 
before. In Ottesdal itself, the townsfolk say it's too early to 
say who was behind he blast -- but they wouldn't be surprised if 
it was the ANC themselves. 
  The police in the Western Transvaal say they have had no 
luck 
so far in identifying anyone in connection with the spate of 
blasts in the area. Intelligence sources said they doubted any 
arrests would be made "unless the police get lucky." 
Intelligence officers are combing thousands of files in an 
attempt to identify radical rightwingers, but they frankly admit 
there is little chance of stopping the saboteurs unless a cell 
can be infiltrated -- something that has proved difficult in 
recent months. 
  The explosives used include home-made devices concocted from 
diesel fuel and fertiliser, but commercial explosives have also 
been used in several blasts. One intelligence source said 
outdated stock from mines was the main source. 
  Security forces are desperate to put an end to the bombings 
-- but intelligence sources say the right wing has the 
capability to "completely disrupt this country -- and there is 
little we can do about it." 
  "We don't have a plan to combat them, we are undermanned and 
our biggest problem is that everything we do gets leaked to them 
in advance," said one frustrated senior SADF [South African 
Defence Force] source, who believes the rightwing campaign will 
"get worse" as the election date nears.

  [Excerpt] Pretoria Feb 7 SAPA -- The SA [South African] 
Police on Monday and over the weekend swooped against suspected 
extremist terrorists of both the far left and far right, Law and 
Order Minister Hernus Kriel said. In Pretoria, he said the 
arrests were made after more than six weeks of intensive 
investigations into a series of far-rightwing terror attacks in 
the [Orange] Free State and the Western Transvaal. 
  On Monday, police arrested five suspects linked to 
far-rightwing organisations. Some were detained in Orkney and 
others in Welkom. 
  Over the weekend, the SA Police arrested seven people, 
including five suspected Azanian Peoples Liberation Army 
members, in connection with the rifle and hand-grenade attack on 
a swimming pool in Richard's Bay, Northern Naal, Mr Kriel said. 
Three R5 rifles and two M26 hand-grenades were seized when the 
arrests were made in Stanger, Empangeni, and near the scene of 
the crime in Richard's Bay. 
  Five right-wing extremists were detained in the Transvaal 
and 
the Free State and explosives and firearms were seized by the 
police. 
  Follow-up operations by the SA Police were still in progress 
and further arrests could be expected, Mr Kriel said. 
  During the swoop in Orkney, a suspect fired with a shotgun 
at 
members of the police through a closed door. A policeman, 
Sergeant Johan Jonker, was hit in the chest, but escaped death 
because he wore a bullet-proof jacket. Police returned fire, Mr 
Kriel said, and the suspect was wounded in the arm. He was 
under police guard in hospital. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb 7 KYODO -- The Supreme Court on Monday 
[7 February] upheld a 1992 High Court decision denying a 
passport to a doctor who was allegedly connected to the Japanese 
Red Army extremist group. 
  Presiding Justice Ryohei Kizaki said the doctor, Takako 
Nobuhara, had worked in Palestinian refugee camps after going to 
Lebanon in 1971. 
  Nobuhara lost her passport and applied for a new one in 1982 
at the Japanese embassy in Syria. 
  But the Foreign Ministry refused to issue the document and 
she filed suit in 1993, demanding a new one. 
  The Tokyo District Court accepted her demand in December 
1989 
and ruled that the ministry's refusal was illegal since her 
alleged close relationship with the Red Army was not 
acknowledged. 
  The ministry then appealed to the Tokyo High Court and the 
court ruled May 19, 1992, that based on the ministry's evidence, 
Nobuhara had been a liaison agent in Beirut for the Red Army's 
leader Fusako Shigenobu. 
  Japanese police have placed Shigenobu on an international 
wanted list. 
  The Red Army, formed in 1971, is responsible for a series of 
hijackings and armed attacks in the 1970s. 
  It is reportedly based in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley and has 
close ties with radical Palestinian groups.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade -- According to the statement issued 
by the Citizens Alliance of Serbia, Veljko Dzakula, former 
official in the government of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, 
was kidnapped yesterday by unidentified people in front of the 
Yugoslav Drama Theater. Dzakula, who had appeared on NTV Studio 
B [independent television station] two nights ago, was kidnapped 
by "three skinheads." 
  In the statement for BORBA, Vesna Pesic, chairman of the 
Citizens Alliance of Serbia and a deputy in the Serbian 
Assembly, said that she immediately sent a telegram concerning 
this incident to Minister Zoran Sokolovic and President 
Milosevic. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Imprisoned for Negotiating </H5>
  Veljko Dzakula, an engineer and former vice president of the 
Republic of Serbian Krajina; Dusan Ecimovic, former information 
minister; and adviser Mladen Kulic were in prison until 21 
September last year -- first in Knin and then in Glina -- for 
signing an 11-point agreement with Ivan Milas, leader of the 
Croatian delegation, after the meeting on 18 February in the 
village of Doljani near Daruvar. 
  "To sign a secret agreement in times of war is an act of 
treason," Goran Hadzic, the then president of the Republic of 
Serbian Krajina said, while Dzakula claimed that he had "the 
authority to negotiate, since the talks with Croatia concerned 
local problems -- reconstruction of the infrastructure, delivery 
of water, electricity..." The interesting thing is that the 
other three members from the negotiating team not only avoided 
any blame (and prison) but also remained at their posts in the 
government of the Republic of Serbian Krajina.

<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  Venezuelan authorities reported on 26 January the capture of 
"Commander Danilo," one of the top commanders of the FARC 
(Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), at the 
Colombian-Venezuelan border near the town of Guasdualito, Apure 
State. Commander Danilo was arrested while in the company of 
three other individuals who are accused of the murder of several 
Venezuelan soldiers, as well as dynamite attacks, ambushes, and 
kidnappings. 
  On their part, Colombian authorities have reported eight

  Authorities in Cucuta have dealt a harsh blow to the ELN by 
seizing a large number of weapons and arresting four rebels. 
More than 23,000 rounds of Venezuelan-made ammunition, FAL 
assault rifles, 9-mm pistols, explosives, a computer, and a book 
entitled "State Terrorism," which denounces alleged human rights 
violations by the certain officers, were seized by Army 
intelligence personnel during the search of a house in Bogota. 
According to the Army, the weaponry belongs to the Northeastern 
Commando of the ELN, which operates in the Arauca, Santander, 
and Norte de Santander Departments. (Santa Fe de Bogota

mines placed by the Army and guerrillas during the 12-year war 
that ended in January 1992; nevertheless, company representative 
Michel Jean-Pierre warned the Salvadoran people there may still 
be some devices, and he recommended children be educated in that 
regard. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2143 GMT 28 Jan 94) 
<H5>  Guatemala </H5>
  Authorities in Coban, Alta Verapaz Department, reported on 
27 
January that unidentified individuals blew up a stretch of the 
oil pipeline between Rubelsanto and Santo Tomas de Castilla, 
Izabal, causing thousands of quetzals in losses. (Guatemala 
City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 28 Jan 94 p 2) 
  URNG guerrillas issued a communique on 1 February reporting 
they had inflicted 17 casualties on Army troops in clashes in 
Quiche Department. The URNG said 14 of the casualties were

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on regional guerrilla activities and clashes with 
government military units monitored through 7 February. Source 
is cited in parentheses following each item. 
<H5>  Colombia </H5>
  Today, military sources reported that Colombian Armed Forces 
have seized half a ton of explosives hidden by Army of National 
Liberation (ELN) guerrillas in a house located in Santander 
Department. No arrests were made during the operation. A 
spokesperson for the Fifth Army Brigade stationed in Bucaramanga 
said the explosives, which included more than 500 kgs of 
explosives and mines known as "leg breakers," [quiebrapatas] 
were hidden at a local ranch. According to the report, the 
rebels favor this type of explosive to block military patrols, 
and it has inflicted numerous casualties on the the region's 
peasants. In another military operation which took place on 
Thursday, an army patrol was also able to seize weapons and 
12,000 rounds of bullets from an ELN group operating in Cucuta, 
Norte de Santander Department. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0124 GMT 8 
Feb 94) 
  Ecopetrol [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] authorities 
reported that crude oil pumping operations at the Los Llanos 
central pipeline were suspended on 3 February as a result of an 
ELN attack which caused considerable damage to the pipe's 
infrastructure. According to an Ecopetrol spokesperson, ELN 
guerrillas detonated a dynamite charge near the Rio Chiquito 
area, located in the municipality of Aguazul, Casanare which 
destroyed an important stretch of the pipeline. Police and 
military authorities in the area have announced an increase in 
security measures along the Casanare petroleum infrastructure in 
order to prevent any further attacks. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL 
NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 3 Feb 94 p 14A) 
<H5>  El Salvador </H5>
  This Saturday, the National Civilian Police (PNC) uncovered 
a 
new weapons stockpile in an underground warehouse in San 
Francisco Gotera, Morazan Department. The discovery was the 
result of information provided by local peasants. Weapons seized 
included 50 blocks of TNT, 20,000 rounds of assorted shells 
including those for FAL, AK-47, and 16-mm rifles. PNC sources 
pointed out that in the past few days they have uncovered 
numerous weapons in the area. (San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY in 
Spanish 7 Feb 94 p 11) 
<H5>  Peru </H5>
  National Police sources report that one intelligence 
services 
junior officer had been tortured and killed on Sunday by alleged 
subversives in the Lima district of Los Olivos. Police 
investigating the case believe the police officer was killed in 
another area and afterwards the body was dumped at Los Olivos. 
Several months ago, two police lieutenants were also killed by a 
guerrilla commando unit in the same area. (Paris AFP in Spanish 
1557 GMT 7 Feb 94) 
  A DINCOTE (National Counterterrorism Directorate) agent was 
killed this past Saturday by a four-man Shining Path `death 
squad' in Huancayo, Junin Department, located 315 km east of 
Lima. The agent was killed when his car was intercepted by the 
terrorists while driving towards the local DINCOTE headquarters. 
In another incident, two terrorists were killed Friday in 
Huaraz, 400 km north of Lima when an Army patrol clashed with a 
20-man Shining Path column that was trying to hold-up a bus.

  [Excerpts] The La Paz district attorney's office has been 
damaged by a terrorist attack. 
  An explosion shook the La Paz district attorney's office at 
noon today. The explosion occurred in a restricted area very 
close to Prosecutor Javier Dibs's office. The damage was small 
and no one was injured. [passage omitted] 
  The bomb was placed in a corridor through which Dibs enters 
and leaves his office. [passage omitted] 
  Two weeks ago the Ministry of Government withdrew the police 
who were guarding the office. It is expected that the new order 
assigning officers to different posts will resolve the problem.

  [Text] The Interior Ministry has issued a positive 
assessment of the results achieved over the last year in the 
struggle against subversion, noting that the strategy of taking 
a legal-political approach to fighting terrorism was 
consolidated in 1993. 
  In the opinion of the ministry, the political isolation of 
the armed groups has been reinforced, while progress has been 
made in disrupting the operations of their principal factions. 
The goal for 1994 and 1995 is to take further steps toward 
neutralizing once and for all the organizations that practice 
political violence in Chile. 
  Another element that was emphasized in the official report 
is 
the fact that in 1993 there were no selective murders, such as 
those that took the lives of Senator Jaime Guzman and the 
bodyguards of Metropolitan Intendent [mayor] Luis Pareto. 
  It also predicted that the next phase of the government's 
strategy will be to isolate the so-called "combatant jail" by 
building a high-security facility to house terrorist leaders so 
that they cannot continue to exert influence over the operative 
cadres that are still free. 
  Before presenting a preliminary report on the matter, Luis 
Toro, attorney for the Interior Ministry, stated that that 
public entity is preparing an overall report on the results of 
the antiterrorist struggle over the past few months. 
  A few days ago, Justice Minister Francisco Cumplido hailed 
the accomplishments of the government and law enforcement in 
this area, noting that now there are about 80 members of the 
Manuel Rodriguez Front and the Lautaro Movement who are being 
held and prosecuted for various crimes that are subversive in 
nature. 
  Without citing specific figures, Toro ventured to say that 
there has been a significant decline in terrorist activities in 
the last year. He also emphasized that several major criminal 
actions were discovered in advance. 
  The official indicated that perhaps one of the most serious 
situations to arise in this regard took place last October when 
terrorists tried to rob a bank in Las Condes. The ensuing clash 
with police forces resulted in eight casualties. 
  Another negative development that he mentioned is the 
various 
opinions on how much involvement Chilean citizen Sergio Olea 
Gaona had in the assassination of Senator Jaime Guzman. The case 
is awaiting judgment in Division 3 of the Supreme Court. 
  Toro noted, however, that major progress has been made in 
investigating the assassination of the man who founded the 
Independent Democratic Union (UDI). Some of the conspirators and 
perpetrators of the assassination have already been arrested, 
including Front members Mauricio Hernandez Norambuena 
("Commander Ramiro") and Ricardo Palma Salamanca ("El Negro"), 
for whom life sentences have been requested. 
  Except for the case of Olea Gaona, the Interior Ministry 
attorney stressed that the vast majority of the cases prosecuted 
by the ministry have culminated in guilty verdicts in the higher 
courts after two or three years. In his opinion, this is proof 
that the government's evidence is solid and conclusive. 
  In addition, the government official noted that in the last 
12 months, forces have been successful in breaking up the 
central structure of terrorist factions such as the "Raul 
Pellegrin Detachment," a military wing of the autonomous Manuel 
Rodriguez Front. 
  He also cited as an accomplishment of the government the 
eradication of other political-criminal groups such as the 
People in Arms Movement. He explained that these are bands made 
up of former members of terrorist groups who are collaborating 
with common criminals to carry out their actions. 
  He further contended that the Lautaro group is still 
suffering major losses in its upper ranks, with the capture of 
the number-two man in the Lautaro Popular Liberation Forces 
(FRPL), Claudio Melgarejo Chavez, and later of Delfin Diaz, both 
members of the top leadership. As a result, the noose has been 
tightened around the head of the organization, Guillermo 
Ossandon Canas ("Diego Carvajal"), who still has ties with 
inexperienced members. 
  "The government's strategy called for an initial phase of 
politically isolating the terrorist groups, so that the police 
could then proceed to break them up. That phase is still in 
progress," he indicated. 
  The official explained that the next step in the immediate 
future is to isolate the "combatant jail" by opening a 
maximum-security prison facility inside the former Santiago 
Penitentiary to house persons convicted of terrorist offenses 
committed after 11 March 1990. 
  "This is something that terrorist groups are very fearful 
of, 
because it would mean that their principal leaders in custody 
would be precluded from exerting any strategic or tactical 
influence over cadres who are currently free," he emphasized. 
  He acknowledged, however, that it cannot be said yet that 
the 
subversive groups have been neutralized. "This year we will 
consolidate the great progress we have made toward breaking them 
up, and we plan to have them neutralized sometime during 1995," 
he indicated. 
  He explained that the strategy of politically isolating 
terrorists has been manifested in the gradual severing of ties 
between these bands and the more traditional left, the 
widespread condemnation of their actions, and the shunning of 
the most active militants. 
  Despite this optimistic official approach, various civilian 
sectors and political opposition organizations have constantly 
questioned the administration's ability to deal with the issue 
of citizen security in general, and political violence in 
particular. 
  The criticism has focused primarily on the Coalition's 
erroneous conclusion that normalizing democratic life alone 
would reduce terrorist activity, and on the other hand, the fact 
that it has sent the wrong signal by granting pardons to people 
convicted of this type of crime. 
  The latter situation has been aggravated by the president's 
decision to commute life sentences to exile in Europe for 
members of extremist organizations that participated in actions 
resulting in the death of law enforcement personnel, such as the 
assault on the Lautaro Bakery and the armed attack on the Los 
Quenes Reserve Post. 
  A total of 19 people have had their sentences commuted to 
exile. 
  Another 14 individuals are still serving time for subversive 
offenses; of those, four are candidates for pardon, including 
the gunmen who attacked Gen. Augusto Pinochet's presidential 
entourage. Another case has not yet applied for a pardon, and 
the others are awaiting conviction to be eligible. 
  The last prisoner to receive a presidential pardon, having 
his sentence commuted to 20 years in exile, was Hugo Gomez Pena, 
sentenced to 35 years in prison for the death of Carabinero 
Miguel Vasquez Tobar on 18 April 1986. He went to Belgium on 22 
December. 
  During the Aylwin administration, 435 prisoners convicted of 
subversive offenses have been released. 
  In addition to stressing the negative signal these pardons 
send, as officials strive to develop an effective strategy 
against terrorism, political leaders and parliamentarians 
concerned with this issue also note that certain government 
circles and the political coalition that backs the government 
have failed to show consistent political support for the work of 
the police.

  [Excerpt] Individuals who identified themselves as Lautaro 
Group members held up a bank in the Providencia neighborhood. 
The thieves, who fired their weapons at Carabineros officers as 
they fled, seized 15 million pesos. 
  Eight Lautaro Group members tried to simultaneously hold up 
two banks on the corner of Suecia and 11 September Streets. 
However, they only managed to hold up the Santander Bank. The 
presence of Carabineros on the corner prompted the group 
planning to hold up the Citibank branch a few meters away to 
flee. 
  As they fled, the delinquents fired their weapons at a group 
of policemen travelling in a patrol van. Once again a woman was 
seen firing a machine gun. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 3 Feb (DPA) -- A commando unit 
of the communist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 
has claimed responsibility for the latest terrorist escalation 
that took place this morning in the northwestern Colombian city 
of Medellin. [see previous Terrorism Report] 
  The subversives sent a clandestine communique to Medellin 
radio stations, justifying the planting of explosives at U.S. 
facilities to reject the presence of U.S. troops in Colombia. 
  Four bombs exploded at Citibank branches and at an English 
academy in several Medellin locations. Meanwhile, the police 
defused three other explosive devices. 
  The FARC said the presence of U.S. soldiers harms Colombian 
interests; thus, it is exerting pressure for their immediate 
departure. 
  About 250 U.S. soldiers are building bases in Puerto Lopez, 
Meta Department, and in Araracuara, Amazonas Department, to 
detect drug traffickers' planes. In addition, the troops are 
building a school, a health center, and a road in Juanchaco, in 
the western Valle del Cauca Department. 
  Mauricio Navas Talero, a former Attorney General's Office 
high-ranking official, filed a petition today for protection, a 
judicial mechanism used to protect constitutional rights, 
requesting the departure of foreign soldiers. 
  Navas explained the Colombian Constitution does not empower 
the president "to tolerate, consent, or allow the entry of 
foreign troops in the country." This would be acceptable if the 
Council of State issued an authorization. 
  He added "to defend this constitutional right, I am asking 
the courts to urge President Cesar Gaviria to order the 
immediate departure of the troops." 
  Judicial sources have said the courts will issue a ruling on 
the petition for protection within 10 days.

  [Text] A wave of terrorist attacks in Medellin on 3 
February has caused property damage but no fatalities or 
injuries. Authorities attribute the attacks to urban guerrillas. 
  Colonel Daniel Peralta, subcommander of the Medellin 
Metropolitan Police, said four bombs exploded during the day and 
three were deactivated in a wave of attacks perpetrated by 
guerrilla commandos against U.S. companies. Col. Peralta said 
the attacks were made on a stationery store, two educational 
centers, and a construction site near a bus terminal. 
  "The bombs, each one made with 3 kg of dynamite, exploded at 
an English language school, a German language school, and a 
travel agency. Two other bombs were deactivated at the Citibank 
and Diner's Club main offices," Col. Peralta reported. 
  He added that the most serious incident occurred at the "El 
Ancla" stationery store, located in downtown Medellin, where the 
explosion started a fire causing damage estimated at 20 million 
pesos. 
  According to reports, the blast caused millions of dollars 
in 
property damage due to shattered windows and glass doors and a 
fire, which started in one of the offices that was attacked, but 
there were no fatalities. 
  "The attacks were perpetrated by guerrilla commandos 
protesting the presence of U.S. troops in Colombia," Col. 
Peralta said. Authorities attribute the bomb attacks to 
guerrillas from the Army of National Liberation and the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which declared U.S. 
companies and citizens living in Colombia military targets to 
protest the presence of U.S. soldiers in Colombia. 
  Currently, there are 249 U.S. soldiers in Colombia working 
on 
humanitarian and social assistance projects, training programs, 
and the installation of radars for the fight against drug 
trafficking. 
  The largest group, 156 soldiers, are building a school, a 
hospital, and a road in the town of Juanchaco, in Valle del 
Cauca Department. The other units are constructing a military 
base in Puerto Lopez, Meta Department. 
  A week ago, rebels blew up two Mormon churches and a Coca 
Cola plant in the city of Bucaramanga, and kidnapped two 
missionaries in eastern Colombia.

  [Text] Cucuta -- On Wednesday, the Army frustrated a 
terrorist plan prepared by the Guerrilla Coordinating Board 
(CGR) when the 5th Mechanized Group, based in Cucuta, seized a 
large amount of arms and ammunition intended for the ELN [Army 
of National Liberation]. 
  According to the version given by military detachment 
commander Colonel Henry Dominguez, the seizure dismantled a 
major part of the CGR's logistical structure tasked with 
supplying arms and quartermaster supplies to the various groups 
who operate in the Departments of Santander and Norte de 
Santander, the southern part of Cesar Department, and Bolivar 
Department. 
  The operation began at 0500 [1000 GMT] on 2 February and 
ended 12 hours later. Alfredo Angarita Torres, "Hermes," 
logistic wing leader of the northeastern war front; Jesus Emilio 
Ovalle Rodriguez, "Chucho;" and sisters Angelina and Barbara 
Perez Duran were captured in house No. 3-77 on 21st Avenue, in 
the Tasajero neighborhood.

  [Text] Medellin (Colombia), 6 Feb (DPA) -- Military sources 
informed DPA that tonight a commando unit of the Simon Bolivar 
Guerrilla Coordinating Board (CGSB) attacked a Colombian Army 
base on the outskirts of the northwestern city of Medellin. 
  From positions in surrounding buildings and in the Medellin 
metro (under construction), some 20 snipers fired repeatedly at 
the Palermo Battalion installations, located in the densely 
populated Aranjuez sector. An elite Army corps known as the 
"men of steel" is trained at this base. Its members are tasked 
with patrolling Medellin's poorest neighborhoods, where crime 
has been rampant for the past few years. 
  Precisely in one of these neighborhoods today a clandestine 
armed group known as the "People's Militia" -- which was devoted 
to meting out "private justice" -- announced its disbandment. 
The "People's Militias" are accused of having committed 
hundreds of crimes against criminals, vagrants, and drug addicts 
who roam the streets of Medellin's poorest sectors. The Army's 
"men of steel" not only patrol these areas, they also help build 
schools, health care centers, day care centers, and perform 
other social works. 
  The Army High Command has not issued any statement regarding 
the attack on this battalion, and there have been no reports 
regarding casualties.

hours. Andres Botero in investigating the violence in Risaralda 
Department. [see Selected Video Reports section for accompanying

  [Botero] Pereira citizens had not yet recovered from the 
dramatic attack on a city clinic when criminals detonated two 
more explosive devices at 2200 on 8 February, injuring five 
persons and causing damages estimated at 300,000 pesos. 
  The first explosion destroyed the facade of the office of 
Juan Hurtado Cano, Conservative Party senate candidate, in 
downtown Pereira. At the same time in Dos Quebradas 
Municipality, terrorists detonated another explosive charge in 
front of the offices of Legislator Maria Isabel Mejia Marulanda. 
  [Begin Representative Victor Manuel Tamayo recording] This 
is 
not an isolated incident. It is the result of a confrontation 
between obscure forces and the Colombian democratic system. 
[end recording] 
  [Botero] Risaralda has become the most violent department in 
the country. The figures are shocking. In the last three 
months, 330 people have been murdered, 158 of them in Pereira. 
  [Begin Risaralda Governor Roberto Galves recording] One 
disturbing element is the subversive groups, particularly an 
urban commando that is operating in Pereira and Dos Quebradas. 
There are also confrontations between drug trafficking groups 
that have found in Pereira a strategic location for their

  [Text] Bucaramanga (Colombia), 7 Feb (EFE) -- Three people 
were injured today in one of four bomb attacks against four 
political party offices in cities in Colombia's Santander 
Department (in the northeast part of the country), including the 
department's capital of Bucaramanga, according to authorities. 
[see Selected Video Reports section for TV footage of incidents] 
  Police report the explosive devices were activated by urban 
commando units of communist guerrillas from the National 
Liberation Army (ELN), which operates in Bucaramanga and the 
nearby towns of Giron, Floridablanca, and Piedecuesta. 
According to one source, three people in Giron were treated at 
a hospital for minor injuries they incurred in one of the blasts. 
  The offices that were attacked belonged to Aquiles Tores 
Breton, candidate for mayor of Bucaramanga; conservative 
candidate Jorge Humberto Mantilla; a civic movement in Giron; 
and Consuelo Duran de Mustafa in Piedecuesta. In December, 
other Santander political party offices belonging to candidates 
running in the 13 March congressional and municipal elections 
were also targets of similar bomb attacks in actions attributed 
to the ELN guerrillas.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Feb (DPA) -- Several gunmen 
on a highway leading to the Colombian city of Ibague murdered 
Colombian Ambassador to Honduras Lucelly Garcia today. 
  Garcia, 60, had presented her credentials to the Honduran 
Government 14 days ago and had returned to Colombia to present a 
book entitled "Petition for Protection, Opening to Democracy." 
  The police reported the diplomat was traveling from the 
coffee-producing area of Calarca, her hometown, to Santa Fe de 
Bogota in the company of her sister Ruby Garcia, the Colombian 
consul to Mexico, who was injured. 
  Ruby Garcia said a four-wheel drive vehicle blocked the path 
of the car in which they were traveling, and two men came out of 
it, and one of them shot the ambassador, who was taken to a 
clinic in Ibague where she died. 
  The circumstances surrounding the attack on Ambassador 
Garcia 
are unclear. The police said robbery could have been the 
motive, but murder was not ruled out. 
  Garcia, a liberal, was governor of the western Department of 
Quindio, where Calarca is located. She was also a member of the 
Lower Chamber of the Colombian Congress. She lost her seat over 
a scandal about alleged irregular activities favoring her 
hometown's Culture House. 
  For more than 30 years the diplomat's political life was 
characterized by her combativeness, which was reflected in 
strong speeches, vigorous decisions, and constant clashes with 
her adversaries. 
  Her body will reportedly be taken to Santa Fe de Bogota in 
the next hours for an homage at the Congress of the Republic, 
political friends of the murdered ambassador said.

  [Text] San Salvador, 10 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Three masked 
individuals killed a member of the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front (FMLN) Political Party, the FMLN reported 
today. The FMLN activist was identified as Ismael Bernardino, 
and the incident took place early on Wednesday in the town of 
Nahuizalco, in western Sonsonate Department. 
  FMLN spokeswoman Aida Sanchez explained that, according to 
preliminary reports in her possession, three individuals went to 
Bernardino's home and killed him. "The hooded individuals were 
carrying large caliber weapons," the relatives of the victim 
indicated. Sanchez stated the men tried to create the 
impression that it was a burglary but did not take anything from 
the house. It cannot be ruled out that a death squad killed 
Bernardino, who was fully participating in the political 
campaign, since these groups "are still active" in El Salvador, 
the spokeswoman stressed. 
  Representative of the UN Observers for El Salvador went to 
the site to begin an investigation.

1,000 terrorists in cases it handled this year, Daniel Espichan 
Tumay announced yesterday. The official also appealed to 
authorities not to let down their guard facing the subversive 
enemy so as to prevent such terrorists from once again sowing 
unrest among the people. 
  Espichan Tumay further noted that the respectable figure was 
achieved thanks to the excellent work of the Judicial Branch and 
military and reported that in 1993, 1,500 reformed terrorists 
had cooperated with the courts. 
  While observing that the Peruvian people are convinced that 
positive progress has been made in the fight, he repeated his 
appeal to civilian, military, and police authorities not to rest 
on their laurels. 
  "We must understand that terrorism will continue its 
onslaught because some leaders remain at large. Peace will be 
achieved only as the result of well-planned, transparent work 
and while paying respect to human rights," he said. [passage 
omitted on human rights]

  [Text] Provided with new identities and accompanied by 
their families, five reformed terrorists left the country last 
year to begin new lives and forget the sequels of terror and 
bloodshed in which they participated when they made the mistake 
of joining the ranks of the Shining Path [Sendero Luminoso-SL] 
and MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]. 
  They are among the country's 1,500 reformed terrorists, 
1,300 
of whom have already been reintegrated into society and are 
working in different areas. 
  A number of them are now members of the Peasant Patrols 
working in rural areas. Others, numbering about 50, have assumed 
new identities and gone with their families to other parts of 
the country to take up different activities. 
  Concerning the reformed terrorists who left the country, a 
reliable source reports that they are "intermediate-level" 
leaders of the Shining Path and MRTA who provided important 
information leading to the capture of the main cadres of the 
terrorist organizations. 
  The government has lent them its complete support, providing 
them with traveling allowances in dollars enabling them to get 
along until they can get settled. 
  They have traveled to other South American countries (for 
reasons of security we cannot say where), where the Peruvian 
Embassies are discreetly monitoring them. 
  Six or seven other cases of reformed terrorists are now 
under 
study by the Evaluating Committee, which will determine the 
possibility of sending them abroad. 
  Daniel Espichan Tumay, special attorney general for cases of 
terrorism, was summoned by EL COMERCIO yesterday, but refrained 
from providing details on the matter for reasons of security. 
  Nevertheless, he did explain that the change in identity and 
residence, whether inside or outside of the country, is an 
additional benefit extended to the reformed individuals in 
accordance with the law. 
  He noted that as a member of the Evaluating Committee, he 
observed that here in Peru, the entire procedure is fraught with 
delays and that dishonest legal officials are even turning a 
profit. 
  He said that five members of the single board of the High 
Court of Chiclayo had been removed from their posts when it was 
proven that they were charging a reformed terrorist for handling 
his case, which they had deliberately chosen.

<F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] Two handwritten letters issued by Shining Path 
militants have been delivered to LA REPUBLICA. The letters, 
within the context of the bloody and fateful subversive war that 
bled our country for more than 13 years, could lead to a new 
stage filled with grave and daunting consequences. 
  One of the clandestine or confidential documents is signed 
-- 
in the way pamphlets, pronouncements, or declaration are usually 
done -- by the "Prisoners of war of the Canto Grande Luminous 
Combat Trench [LTC]." 
  The other document is a letter addressed by the captured 
Edmundo Daniel Cox Beuzeville (sentenced to life imprisonment) 
to a colonel. 
  Both documents stress "the ironclad and unconditional 
subordination to the party leadership" undoubtedly represented 
by Abimael Guzman Reynoso, whom they call "President Gonzalo." 
  The letters also express their indubitable support to the 
letters signed by "President Gonzalo" and "Comrade Miriam" and 
their request to President Alberto Fujimori for "a peace 
agreement." 
  The new and worrying aspect of these two letters is that 
together with the deceiving call for a "peace agreement" there 
is a call for a Shining Path "second congress." 
  In other words, the terrorist organization does not lay down 
its arms or surrender. It accepts talks or negotiations with the 
government leading to "a peace agreement" and conspires while 
getting reorganized through a call for a new congress. 
  There is another new element in these documents, the 
implications of which, without a doubt, deserve a broad national 
debate in light of official reports: 
  The Canto Grande inmates and Cox Beuzeville at no time 
mention the much publicized "internal war between Shining Path 
followers." (There is no separation of responsibilities with 
"Comrade Feliciano.") 
  The fourth paragraph of the Canto Grande document, moreover, 
mentions a "black campaign by opportunists and revisionists," 
followed by threatening remarks. 
  The Shining Path has usually used these adjectives to refer 
to leftist political parties, labor organizations, and even to 
nongovernmental organizations (ONG). 
  What is worse, they have not only characterized them as 
opportunists and revisionists and threatened them; but they have 
also used this type of verbal virulence to justify their 
cowardly and absurd crimes against these organizations' leaders 
and social workers. 
  There are, therefore, many answers and many explanations 
behind this disturbing and grim strategy of letters. 
  One of the explanations, for instance, must refer in very 
concrete terms to the revelation made by Cox Beuzeville that he 
has been allowed to leave prison, where he is serving a life 
sentence, to carry out "works" on behalf of pacification. 
<H5>  First letter </H5>
  "Struggle for a peace agreement and establishment of the 
basis for the second congress. 
  "We, the fighting Communists and the masses of the Canto 
Grande Luminous Combat Trench, undeclinably accepting President 
Gonzalo's leadership in this historic and great test, reiterate 
our decision not to take a single step without President 
Gonzalo's personal approval for we are fully convinced that he 
is the greatest Marxist-Leninist-Maoist living on earth, and 
just as he led us in the past, he will lead us again today, 
tomorrow, and forever until we reach our objective, the much 
coveted Communism." 
  It is convenient to stop for a minute in this paragraph. It 
is an organic statement, a statement of ideological 
ratification. It is an act of subordination to Abimael's 
personal leadership. 
  "We also salute and support the new strategic course 
established by him, unshakably sure that the proletarian 
leadership is decisive for victory. Even more so in these 
circumstances of new, complex, and difficult problems for our 
party, the people's war, the Peruvian revolution, and the world 
proletarian revolution." 
  This is a new course for Peruvian revolution. 
  "The fighting Communists and masses, closing ranks with 
President Gonzalo and the Central Leadership, firmly, 
decisively, and tenaciously support the call made by our 
leadership and Comrade Miriam to struggle for a peace agreement 
and establish the basis for the Second Congress, putting into 
practice the unavoidable task of Assuming and Struggle for the 
New Great Decision and Definition as Communists, Maoists, and 
soldiers of the proletariat, with deep revolutionary happiness 
and optimism, and committing ourselves to make Canto Grande a 
forward station of this new stage." 
<H5>  Establish the Basis for the Second Shining Path Congress </H5>
  "With the deepest class hate, we totally and resolutely 
repudiate and condemn the sinister black campaign against 
President Gonzalo and Comrade Miriam, the essence of which is to 
cunningly oppose the Peace Agreement. Those who always attacked 
us furiously have once more unleashed their infamy with even 
more audaciousness. Today more than ever they are moved by 
egotist electoral ambitions and political appetites. They are 
the usual opportunists, revisionists, and lackeys who again show 
their persistent opposition to the true interests of the deep 
masses and the people." 
  It is not against the traditional parties, the legal left, 
labor leaders, or the ONG's. 
  "Assume with firmness and accelerated willingness this New 
Great Decision and Definition because it serves the interests of 
proletarians and the people, hoisting as high as possible the 
always red flags of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and Gonzalo's 
thoughts, our specific and main weapon." 
  "Close lines around President Gonzalo and the Central 
Leadership!" 
  "Raise the flag of the New Great Decision and Definition!" 
  "Struggle for a Peace Agreement and establish the basis for 
the Second Congress!" 
  "Glory to Marxism-Leninism-Maoism!" 
  "Lima, December 1993." 
  "Prisoners of War of the Campo Grande LTC." 
<H5>  Second Letter </H5>
  "Colonel Savino Cayahuanca Farro" 
  "Director of E.P.R.E.M.C.C." 
  "Request of personal audience with the director." 
  "Mister Director" 
  "I come to you Mr. Colonel director of this EPREMCC to 
request a personal audience, which I have repeatedly asked 
through the official authorities of diverse services as of 10 
December 1993, the date I returned from my latest exit from this 
prison, as you know. The purpose of the audience will be to 
discuss directly with you some necessary and important questions 
referring to what we agreed upon in other instances on the 
development of the works and meetings in favor of a successful 
end of the negotiation for a peace agreement. It is true, Mr. 
Colonel, that these tasks are not easy or simple. The struggle 
for a peace agreement is complex, difficult, and risky, and 
involves the difficulties proper of something new!" 
  "Ever since the first time you were so kind to receive me I 
clearly told you, sharply and explicitly, my firm and decisive 
agreement, voluntary support, conscious identification, and full 
adherence to President Gonzalo and Comrade Miriam's letters, 
published and disseminated by President Alberto Fujimori. My 
commitment is, therefore, full, total, unconditional, public, 
decisive, and defined for the course of realizing what today has 
become a need for all: the Peace Agreement. In this way, 
`Peace, everyone's task,' as you rightfully ordered painted at 
the entrance, should be the slogan permitting everyone to 
cooperate in this praiseworthy objective. This cooperation 
should have necessary flexibility, within current laws, 
regulations, and discipline in effect in this prison, which is 
an undeniable fact that is part of this government's success and 
your personal merit." 
  "I reiterate to you, sir, my willingness to discuss all 
problems that might come up and solve them favorably and in 
accordance with the Peace Agreement. This is a norm of behavior 
I adopted ever since I entered this prison, within the framework 
of mutual respect, and in an attempt to serve the objective of 
our national reconciliation without winners or losers: making 
more visible and comfortable our relations between authorities 
and inmates." 
  "I beg of you Mr. Director, to attend to this request and 
agree to it." 
  "EPREMCC, 3 January 1994" 
  "Edmundo Daniel Cox Beuzeville"

  [Text] Police have reported that Demetrio Limoniel Chavez 
Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano" or "Loco Limoniel," has had direct 
contact with "Artemio" and "Clay," who are, respectively, the 
political and military chiefs of the Shining Path's Huallaga 
Regional Committee and were members of the terrorist 
organization's national board. Both Artemio and Clay were close 
to Abimael Guzman Reynoso, aka "Gonzalo." 
  Even though "Vaticano" gave the Shining Path thousands of 
dollars as "quota" or "contributions," the drug trafficker said 
he was not the only one to do so, adding that there are other 
"firms" (organizations of "drug traffickers") who have done the 
same and are still paying large amounts of money. 
  Among the firms are the groups led by "El Ministro," "Lucho 
Culon," "Cholo Claudio," and "Cachiques." 
  During a news conference at DINCOTE [Counterterrorism 
Directorate] facilities on 27 January, it was reported that 
"Vaticano" was practically the "king" of Uchiza in 1988 and 1989. 
  After that he moved to Campanilla, Mariscal Caceres Province 
(San Martin), where among other things he repaired a stretch of 
the Marginal Highway to use it as an airstrip. 
<H5>  Services to Other `Firms' </H5>
  This was the point of departure for not only his small 
planes, but he also used the airstrip to render services to 
other "firms," with the protection and security granted by the 
Shining Path, which was paid $5,000 per flight plus $3 per 
kilogram of basic coca paste or $6 per kilogram of washed coca 
paste. 
  Furthermore, Vaticano has supplied terrorists with war arms 
(FAL and AKM rifles, submachine guns, pistols, etc.), 
transportation services, military outfits, communications 
equipment, food, medicine, and information on the activities of 
the forces of order. 
  Repented terrorists identified by codes AIA-000083, 
AIA-000092, AIJ-O55461, and AIJ-O55463 have confirmed this 
information, positively identifying "Vaticano" as the person who 
gave money to "Artemio" and "Clay," and to other terrorist 
leaders known as "Mancini," "James," and "Liborio," whom he used 
as liaison for paying "quotas" or contributions. 
  DINCOTE sources said "Vaticano" has admitted before the 
special military prosecutor that he is a "narcoterrorist" and 
that when he had his operations center in Uchiza and Campanilla, 
he supplied the Shining Path with medicine, food, clothes, 
transportation, etc. 
  But he did not admit that he supplied firearms, ammunition, 
and explosives. 
  It should be noted that along with "Vaticano," DINCOTE also 
has pressed high treason charges against Shining Path chiefs 
"Artemio" and "Clay," who were charged "in absentia." 
<H5>  Narcoterrorism Uncovered </H5>
  DINCOTE sources said this is the first time police have 
arrested a drug trafficker of "Vaticano's" level who has 
cooperated with terrorism, thus confirming the existence of the 
so-called "narcoterrorism." 
  "In the past, references were made only to the union of 
terrorism and drug trafficking. Countless documents hinting at 
it were found but there was no direct evidence. Now we have it," 
the sources said. 
  One of the major documents shown at the 27 January news 
conference is the "Economic Balance of the Shining Path, 
produced by the `quotas' of (TID) [illegal drug trafficking] 
firms," which DINCOTE seized on 23 August 1993 in the village of 
Anda (Tingo Maria). 
  The balance book has detailed information on daily 
operations 
with income and expenses. It also clearly shows that they 
charged $3,000 to $7,000 per flight by small planes. 
  The balance book, which is dated March 1991, mentions 
"Limoniel" as a debtor for flights that were already made.

afternoon in the Jabalyah refugee camp when IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] soldiers fired at stone throwers. Our correspondent 
Moti Amir reports that this morning, two firebombs were hurled 
at IDF troops in Jabalyah and in Gaza city. There were no 
casualties and no damage was caused. A general strike was 
observed for the third consecutive day in the Gaza Strip today, 
in mourning for the death of the leader of the Fatah Hawks cell 
in Rafah, who was killed in a shootout with IDF soldiers. 
  Khayr Yusuf 'Abdallah, from the village of Bal'a in Samaria, 
was killed this morning by IDF gunfire when he attempted to flee 
his village, which was under curfew. The curfew was imposed in 
an attempt to locate stolen cars. 
  A youth was injured by soldiers' gunfire near al-Duhayshah 
refugee camp after breaking through an Army roadblock in his car.

  [Text] Policemen and Special Services Unit agents are still 
at the site of the explosion evaluating the situation, trying to 
determine the exact amount of explosives that were used for the 
car bomb and assessing the resultant damage. 
  The bodies of the two newspaper and magazine distributors 
who 
were killed are still at Air Force Headquarters. They were in a 
light blue Datsun which bore license plates SG-6691. 
  I am going to speak with individuals who live across from 
the 
Air Force installations to see the condition of their homes, to 
ask them what they observed and how it was possible for a car 
bomb to explode at the headquarters. Certain residents have 
already informed us the explosion was possible, because at 
exactly 0600 the Air Force opens the street to allow vehicles to 
circulate freely in the area, and the subversives took advantage 
of that opportunity to place the car bomb. 
  [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 1314 GMT on 7 February carries a 
150-word report on the incident which adds: "The explosion took 
place on `8 July' Avenue, Santa Beatriz District. Broken glass 
injured an undisclosed number of pedestrians as well as 
individuals who were inside their homes. The explosion also 
damaged a bank, the Peruvian Telephone Company, and several 
homes. The police have made no disclosures regarding the 
possible perpetrators of the attack. The vehicle used for the 
car bomb has been described only as a Datsun."]

  [Excerpts] Lima, 7 Feb (AFP) -- At least six persons were 
injured Monday evening in an escalation of dynamite attacks by 
the Maoist Shining Path against bank offices and public entities 
in the Peruvian capital, police have reported. [passage omitted] 
  The evening attacks affected four bank offices, two of which 
are the Banco de Credito and Interbanc. The explosions injured 
six pedestrians and partially destroyed the facade of the 
offices. Special police units alerted by telephone traveled 
through different parts of Lima and defused packages containing 
explosives near two state banks. A vehicle was found in the 
populous Yerbateros neighborhood, east of Lima, with a homemade 
rocket launcher inside that was about to go off. At least five 
explosions were registered in the outskirt districts of San Juan 
de Lurigancho and Comas, according to police reports. 
  Police stations increased their security in light of the 
possibility of Shining Path attacks and police patrols in 
strategic areas of the capital have been doubled. 
  The acts of violence reported Monday coincide with leaflet 
advertisements, which were delivered to editorial rooms of 
various Lima dailies, stating that the Shining Path is preparing 
to launch a wave of attacks in February.

  [Text] Tonight terrorists hurled a package with explosives 
at the Banco de Credito branch located in Caqueta Avenue. The 
explosion caused minor injuries to three passersby and property 
damage to the bank. Other explosions were also reported tonight 
in Lima. 
  This is the fourth time subversive units have attacked the 
Banco de Credito located one block from Parque del Trabajo, 
between the districts of Rimac and San Martin de Porras. 
  The incident took place at approximately 2000 when a package 
with explosives was thrown by two terrorists traveling in a 
white Volkswagen. The blast damaged the bank's neon sign and 
also ruptured the potable water pipes. The police also reported 
similar attacks to local banks located in Peru and Mexico 
Avenues in La Victora. Only minor property damages and no 
casualties have been reported.

  [Text] According to military sources, Army Commander Daniel 
Garcia has ordered Army Intelligence Chief Colonel Leonardo 
Garcia to redouble efforts in the investigation to identify the 
members of the "Artigas Guard." 
  Garcia's decision responds to the issuance this week of a 
communique -- the third in less than two years -- questioning 
the attitude of several military chiefs. Military sources have 
reported that Army officers received copies of the communique. 
The text of the communique, which is unsigned and is not 
identified in any way, was also sent to several members of the 
media, including BUSQUEDA. 
  The first public appearance of the so-called "Artigas Guard" 
goes back to April 1992 when it claimed responsibility for the 
explosion of a bomb outside former President Julio Sanguinetti's 
office. 
  Sources close to the Army commander's office have reported 
that Garcia will not comment on the new communique, "in which 
its leaders are not identified." 
  However, other military sources have said that Garcia "is 
not 
amused" over the continued discussions on the "Artigas Guard." 
The sources added that although he is aware that "it is not 
easy" to detect these "anonymous plotters," he is "restless" 
because the investigation did not yield any results. 
  This third communique issued by the "Artigas Guard" 
addresses 
messages to Garcia; General Raul Mermot, the Third Army Division 
chief; and Lieutenant General Hugo Medina, retired, the former 
Army commander. 
  Alluding to the changes Garcia intends to make in the Army, 
the communique states that "the fastest path may be the most 
dangerous." The four-page communique entitled "Preliminary 
Report of Communique No. 3 of the Artigas Guard," states that 
"Trying to straighten in a few months a piece of the most noble 
steel that has been bent for years, will surely break him." 
  It adds that if we do not recover "our self-confidence and 
loyalty (...) all of us will fail" and "we will be defeated 
soldiers forever, you and your subordinates." 
  Later, the communique severely questions Gen. Hugo Mermot 
and 
former Army Commander Medina who in the last few weeks protested 
and expressed their opposition to the reforms promoted by 
Garcia. Mermot was held for 10 days because of a letter he 
addressed to Garcia demanding participation in the planned 
reforms. 
  The communique states that during the time he was director 
of 
the Armed Forces sanitary services, Mermot did not show the same 
concern over the difficulties that the families of those 
soldiers who were hospitalized in the Military Hospital had to 
face. 
  It adds: "You (...) are now suffering in flesh and blood 
what your subordinates have suffered for a long time." 
  The Artigas Guard tells Medina: "There is a time to speak 
and 
a time to be silent (...) and we believe you did not act 
accordingly at one time or the other." 
  Medina is also pointed out as "spokesman" of "a group of 
military men who condition the future of the institution to the 
holding of their posts." 
  Paraphrasing General Jose Artigas, the communique ends by 
stating: "We will never allow our common enemy to take the 
slightest advantage of our disagreements."

to Iran Ahmad al-Hasan by an unidentified IRNA correspondent in 
Tehran; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] On the effect of any possible 
agreement between Israel and Syria on the presence of Syrian 
forces in Lebanon and the dismantling of Hizballah bases, Syrian 
Ambassador in Tehran Ahmad al-Hasan said: The Israeli forces 
are on Lebanese territory and will remain until the Israeli

  Commenting on Western news media analyses of the possibility 
of U.S. pressure on Syria to influence its relations with 
Tehran, he said: Syria will permit no country to interfere in 
its internal affairs. Syria's independent stance is clear to 
all. 
  On the presence of Palestinian forces opposed to the 
Gaza-Jericho Accord in Damascus, the Syrian ambassador said: We 
believe that those who fight to liberate their territory are not 
terrorists. They are merely struggling to liberate their usurped 
land. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Informed diplomatic sources in Cairo have revealed 
that a Pakistani security delegation has recently visited Cairo 
and met with Egyptian security officials. The Pakistani team 
renewed a call for an Egyptian security delegation to visit 
regions in Pakistan suspected of being strongholds for 
extremists, to make sure that no such activities currently 
exist. The delegation stressed that Pakistan is eager for 
Egypt's stability and security and will not allow on its 
territory any person that may harm them. 
  The sources stressed that over the past two months, Pakistan 
has deported hundreds of Arab students who were illegally 
residing in that country. The sources told AL-AHRAM 
correspondent Yahya Ghanim that the Pakistani authorities gave 
those Arabs--including Egyptians, Tunisians, and Algerians who 
took part in the war in Afghanistan--one month to leave the 
country; the deadline has expired. 
  In a related development, official Pakistani sources said it 
is likely that Pakistan will sign extradition agreements with 
Egypt, Tunisia, and Algeria.

  [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn has received a cable 
from Shaykh As'ad Bayyud al-Tamimi, amir of the Islamic Jihad 
Movement-Bayt al-Maqdis on the third anniversary of the 
U.S.-Zionist military aggression against Iraq. 
  The cable says: The Jihad Movement has devoted its utmost 
efforts, both in terms of funds and personal sacrifice, for the 
sake of raising the flag of Allahu Akbar [God Is Great]. You 
were the warrior who carried that flag to confront the gathering 
of infidels, who advanced from various parts of the world in 
order to extinguish the torch of freedom burning on the Land of 
the Two Rivers and to subjugate Iraq just as they have 
subjugated other Arab and Muslim rulers, who now rush to the 
Black House in Washington in order to request mercy and pardon 
and to receive the infidels' instructions to strike at our 
peoples and to mortgage their honour and dignity in return for a 
cheap livelihood and the existence of a feeble, powerless rule. 
  The cable adds: The Mother of Battles was like the Mu'tah 
Battle in which the Muslims faced the Romans in Greater Syria 
[Bilad al-Sham] under the command of Zayd Bin-Harithah, Ja'far 
Bin-Abi-Talib, and 'Abdallah Bin-Rawahah, may God rest their 
souls in peace. Later, the command was passed to Khalid 
Bin-al-Walid, may God rest his soul in peace, who maneuvered and 
then withdrew. The Mother of Battles was also like the battle 
of the prophet's grandson, al-Husayn, peace be upon him, who 
faced injustice without surrendering. Al-Husayn preferred to 
meet his God and enter paradise than live a luxurious life and 
remain silent toward injustice and the unjust ones. There was 
no parity in arms and men. There was only dependence on God and 
whatever means of confrontation were available. 
  There can be no comparison between spiritual and material 
values. Spiritual values are linked to God, and fate is ordained 
in God's Holy Book and in the traditions of His prophet. So 
those who faced the world with its Persian and Roman empires 
with the spirit of Jihad faced death for the sake of God. They 
were not afraid of the enemy's superior power. 
  The nation looks up at you while you still stand lofty, 
telling free men that Palestine is still Arab. You are the only 
one among the rulers still considering Palestine Arab. The 
rulers calmed down and were therefore humbled. They removed 
Palestine from the nation's map and geography. Damn them. The 
nation still has men who can achieve glories. The United States 
will vanish and God's order will prevail, whether the infidels 
like it or not. 
  The cable continues: During the immortal Mother of Battles 
we smelled the fragrance of history, recalling Muslim victories 
in Palestine and visualizing the armies of Khalid-Bin-al-Walid 
crossing the Syrian Desert to al-Yarmuk on the approaches of 
Palestine. 
  May God grant victory to Iraq. May God make the Holy Koran 
your guardian. May God make you the rightly guided leader. May 
the traditions of God's prophet be your torch with which to 
extinguish the fire of hatred and Mazdaism. Please, your 
excellency, accept from the Palestinian people's mujahidin their 
blessings and prayers for your steadfastness in the face of the 
enemies. Victory will come soon after the removal of the 
blockade and its unjust tools. God is all-powerful.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report from Sanaa] </F>
  [Text] Four Afghan Egyptians [reference to Egyptians who 
had fought in Afghanistan] arrived in Cairo international 
airport from Sanaa yesterday morning on board a Yemeni aircraft. 
They were escorted by a team of state security officers. 
  A ranking Egyptian security delegation is currently holding 
contacts with officials in Sanaa concerning the handover of 20 
Afghan Egyptians, who reside in [the guest house unit] "wahdat 
dar al-diyafah." This unit is forging passports, identity 
cards, and dollars and is training new Egyptians who arrive in 
Yemen either directly from Egypt or from Afghanistan. 
  The Afghan Egyptians are trained on how to carry out 
destruction and assassination operations using remote control. 
The trainer is called Sulayman al-Fahl, who is an expert on the 
use of remote control devices. The same devices were used in 
the assassination attempt against Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. 
  The official in charge of the Yemeni guest house unit is an 
Egyptian called 'Adil Yusri or Abu-'Ammar. He has strong ties 
with Gulf personalities, who finance this unit's various 
activities after Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri had convinced some 
influential figures in Yemen to make certain areas in the 
northern provinces safe havens for this dangerous unit. 
  Yemeni sources have revealed to AL-AHALI that some northern 
provinces in Yemen has more than one guest unit used as houses 
by Afghan Egyptians and non-Egyptians. A well-known guest unit 
is run by Shaykh Muqbil al-Wadi'i in Sa'dah. This unit includes 
groups of Egyptians, Sudanese, Algerians, and Libyans. 
Al-Wadi'i is opposed to Yemeni unity and is financing these 
groups. Another guest house is located in the province of 
Dhamar, 80 km south of Sanaa, run by some defunct royal families. 
  A Yemeni leader spent five hours in Cairo a month ago. 
During his short stay, the Yemeni official conveyed a complete 
file containing a list of the places and names of the Afghan 
Egyptians in Yemen. 
  The file revealed that Yemen and Turkey are used as centers 
for the Afghan Egyptians. According to security information, 
Turkey has become a link between the [extremist] leaders 
residing in Geneva and Copenhagen such as Ayman al-Zawahiri and 
Tal'at Qasim Hammam and the groups residing in Yemen. Cairo 
had, in the past, focused on Tehran and Khartoum as centers for 
the Afghan Egyptians according to the security reports, which 
previously focused on other topics. 
  Sanaa had previously denied that terrorist Egyptian groups 
were in Yemen until the newspaper AL-MITHAQ, the mouthpiece of 
the General People's Congress led by President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, revealed that such groups do actually exist in Yemen.

Article Type:BFN 

<F P=106> [Letter from "the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in </F>
Amman"] 
  [Excerpts] [greeting passage omitted] Your esteemed 
newspaper on 31 January published an article on page 18 by Dr. 
Muhammad al-Mahasinah under the headline "Was Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah 
a Victim of Polarization or Peace?" In view of the errors 
contained in the article and given the freedom of the press and 
opinion, we would like to have the following explanation 
published with our thanks and appreciation. [passage omitted] We 
find it necessary to reply to what Dr. al-Mahasinah wrote in his 
article. 
  1. The Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran denounces and 
condemns the terrorist and cowardly act which led to the death 
of Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah in Beirut. The embassy can only extend 
its sincere sympathy and condolences to his family and the 
sisterly Jordanian family as a whole and to beseech God almighty 
to have mercy on his soul and to grant his family solace and 
patience. 
  2. It is a source of consternation that this article, which 
lacks objectivity and logic, should be written by a Jordanian 
figure of the status of Dr. al-Mahasinah, who is the professor 
of law at the university. In his article, al-Mahasinah tried in 
vain to link this cowardly act with the Islamic Republic of 
Iran's stand on the so-called peace or with the issue of the 
reduction of the number of Iranian diplomats in Jordan. [passage 
omitted] 
  Dr. al-Mahasinah should not have announced his stand off the 
cuff. He should have waited until things became clear and facts 
became solid before leveling accusations at others. In order to 
put him in the picture along with others who do not know, we say 
that the Islamic Republic of Iran's stand toward the Zionist 
enemy is a principled and constant stand that will not change 
one iota under any circumstance. This stand was not developed 
yesterday or by chance. Indeed, it is older than the victorious 
Islamic revolution in Iran. History recorded the Islamic and 
principled stands adopted by Imam Khomeyni, may God sanctify his 
secret, throughout his life against the occupying enemy whether 
in the Shah's dungeons, in exile, or in power. Therefore, our 
stand toward what is now called the peace process emanates from 
this principled and deep-rooted stand. 
  As regards the issue of reducing the number of Iranian 
diplomats in Jordan, we would like to emphasize that the warm 
relations between the two fraternal countries, which are 
permeated by the spirit of brotherhood and love, are proceeding 
forward under the wise leadership of the two countries. 
  For our part, we are concerned about maintaining these 
relations and we will not allow anyone to undermine them. From 
this particular premise, we say that the reduction of the number 
of diplomats is purely an organizational issue as stated by 
responsible quarters in Jordan. Here, we also reaffirm our 
concern about maintaining the higher interest of the two 
countries and about proceeding forward with these active 
relations no matter what the sacrifices are. We have no doubt 
at all that the Jordanian leadership shares the same feeling and 
that the recent statements by the wise leadership in Jordan are 
evidence of this. Hence, while we reiterate our deep regret 
about what was written outside the realm of logic, we ask the 
honorable and esteemed SAWT AL-SHA'B newspaper to be accurate 
and cautious more than ever before. 
  [Signed] The Embassy of The Islamic Republic of Iran in 
Amman.

<F P=106> [Kathy Evans report: "Congregations Run `Charity' Gauntlet"] </F>
  [Text] As the main prayers of the week end on a Friday 
lunchtime, the departing congregation at Regent's Park mosque in 
London has to run the gauntlet of dozens of young men raising 
money for holy wars against foreign governments. 
  "Fight the Algerian junta!" A bearded man in his 20s stands 
beside a grisly montage of photographs portraying, he says, 
victims of torture by the Algerian government. 
  One youth says he comes from Nubia and is raising money for 
the overthrow of the Mubarak government. 
  "Help the jihad in Egypt," he cries, trying to out-shout 
another youth who says he is collecting for Palestine. 
  Giving money to charity is a religious obligation for 
wealthy 
Muslims. The past five years have seen an explosion in the 
number of Muslim charities not dedicated to purely humanitarian 
aims, say Western counter-terrorism experts. 
  In almost every mosque in Britain, Muslims are being 
encouraged to "Spend in the name of Allah." Nothing is said 
about who receives these donations destined for Bosnia, 
Palestine, Iraq, Algeria and other places. 
  Islamic organisations with overseas connections include: 
<H5>  The Young Muslims </H5>
  Has headquarters in Nottingham and branches around the 
country. Organises charter trips to Sudan and Iran for young 
Muslims. Also offers summer holiday camps featuring lectures 
from Sudanese politicians, Kashmiri mojahedin and black American 
Muslim leaders. 
<H5>  Al Muntada al Islami </H5>
  Based in Parsons Green, west London. Has its own mosque and 
school. Appears to function as a haven in London for the Middle 
Eastern Salafi movement, known for strict religious orthodoxy. 
Said to be popular with Gulf radicals as well as Algerians and 
Lebanese. Has nearly &pound;250,000 in the bank and gave nearly 
&pound;160,000 in "overseas relief" last year. 
<H5>  Muslim Welfare House </H5>
  One of the oldest Muslim organisations in London, based in 
Finsbury Park. Said by the Algerian government to be a 
fundraiser for the Algerian Islamic group FIS [Islamic Salvation 
Front], transferring money to activists subsequently convicted 
of terrorism. Its director, Syrian-born Mahmoud Khani, is said 
to be "ill overseas." Acting director says the organisation does 
not permit political activity in the mosque and has been 
regularly visited by Scotland Yard. 
<H5>  The Murabitoun -- Soldiers of Liberation </H5>
  Run by Abdul Qadir al Sufi, a former Scottish librarian, bit 
part player in Fellini films and now a convert to Islam. 
Campaigns for British Muslim community to be self sufficient, 
with its own banking system and courts. Very active during 
Rushdie affair. 
<H5>  Palestine and Lebanon Relief Fund </H5>
  Said by Israel and Arab press to be a principal conduit of 
funds for the Palestinian Hamas movement. Israeli officials say 
much of the money is spent on weapons. Fund officials say the 
money goes to the zakat committees in occupied territories for 
orphans, widows and hospitals. Other Palestinian charities say 
zakat committees are controlled by Islamacists. 
<H5>  Islamic Foundation </H5>
  Headed by Professor Kurshid Ahmed, known in Pakistan as the 
vice-president of Jamaat Islami, the country's largest radical 
party, which has connections to extremist parties in Afghanistan 
and Kashrnir. Jamaat activists were said to be behind the 
original burning of Salman Rushdie's book in Bradford. 
According to last published accounts in 1990, the foundation 
gave nearly &pound;90,000 to a fund for Kashmir: no details of 
expenditure. Has seven-acre compound in Leicester which hosts 
Islamic conferences. 
<H5>  Islamic Studies Centre </H5>
  Birmingham-based, said to be the base of Surour 
Zeinabbidine, 
a senior ideologue of a radical movement opposing the Saudi 
regime. The Syrian-born cleric reportedly introduced a number of 
the leaders of the kingdom's opposition movement to the idea of 
political Islam.

  [Text] A source close to the Lebanese security forces has 
reported that the Lebanese police arrested a Palestinian who 
admitted that he assassinated Jordanian diplomat Na'ib 
al-Ma'ayitah. The source added that the Palestinian, whose 
identity has not yet been revealed, is a member of an armed 
Palestinian group. 
  A judicial source said two Palestinians have been arrested 
in 
connection with the assassination. The source, however, did not 
confirm the reports that one of them is the perpetrator of the 
crime, but announced that the investigation has reached an 
advanced phase.

  [Text] In Amman, a diplomatic source has announced that the 
Lebanese police have arrested two persons suspected of killing 
Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah, the Jordanian counselor at the Jordanian 
Embassy in Beirut who was assassinated in 29 January in the 
Lebanese capital. The same source added that the two arrested 
persons are Palestinians who belong to a hard-line group which 
could be Fatah-the Revolutionary Council led by Abu-Nidal.

<F P=106> [Statement by Jordanian Ambassador Fakhri Abu-Talib after </F>
meeting Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij in Beirut today, 
followed by remarks in response to questions by unidentified 
correspondents--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Such incidents will not affect 
Jordan or Lebanon. They can happen anywhere. I don't believe 
this incident will deflect the Jordanians from the correct 
course and the wise policy pursued by the king. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Is it true there was a political message to 
the Jordanian regime behind the incident? 
  [Abu-Talib] According to my own analysis, the motives for 
the 
incident were political and were intended to harm both Jordan 
and Lebanon. The perpetrators were criminals supported by agent 
regimes, which still resort to such incidents. 
  [Correspondent] Who are these agent regimes? 
  [Abu-Talib] I cannot identify them. As I told you, those who 
committed this criminal act did not serve the interest of 
Lebanon or the Arab nation. 
  [Correspondent] Are they Arab or non-Arab regimes? 
  [Abu-Talib] Soon you will start interrogating me. 
  [Correspondent] Today's reports say the culprits are 
Palestinians, do they not? 
  [Abu-Talib] I heard what you heard. 
  [Correspondent] Have you confirmed this? 
  [Abu-Talib] We have not. 
  [Correspondent] Do you suspect any particular quarter? 
  [Abu-Talib] We hold nearly all the main leads. But we cannot 
tell the press because we do not want to infringe upon Lebanese 
security or the judicial authorities in Lebanon and play a role 
that is not ours to play.

  [Text] We have just learned that Fatah-the Revolutionary 
Council led by Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna] has denied any 
connection with the assassination of Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah [the 
Jordanian diplomat who was killed in Beirut on 29 January]. 
Fatah-the Revolutionary Council accused the Lebanese security 
forces of arresting and torturing a number of its elements.

  [Excerpts] This morning, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was 
the guest of a conference of educators entitled "Education 
Toward Peace," held in Jerusalem. [passage omitted] 
  [Rabin] Syria could influence Hizballah and prevent it from 
continuing its activities. Syria does not control Hizballah; it 
is commanded by Iran and Lebanon. Nevertheless, Syria could use 
its influence to curb its activities. Syria could give its 
backing to the Lebanese Government by allowing it to deploy more 
troops in south Lebanon, as it wanted to do after Operation 
Accountability, thereby creating the conditions for tranquility 
with a view to reaching a peace treaty with Lebanon, which 
entails certain arrangements concerning security and some 
guarantees concerning the Lebanese who have been operating 
alongside us. Syria has not done that, and I am afraid that in 
this respect, it has not shown by word or deed what we would 
expect of it if the idea is to establish confidence-building 
measures with a view to continuing the peace talks with us.

<F P=106> [Report by army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Military and political sources 
say that a trend of escalating terror attacks has persisted 
since the beginning of the dialogue with the PLO. In 1993, the 
number of terror attacks in Lebanon doubled, the number of 
infiltration attempts increased considerably, and the 
organizations opposed to the peace process have exhibited a 
higher motivation to infiltrate into Israel and carry out 
attacks. The sources say Syria will continue to use Hizballah, 
as it has in previous years, according to its political needs.

Israeli Government and head of the Israeli delegation to the 
negotiations with Lebanon, has stated that Syrian President 
Hafiz al-Asad is using Hizballah as a card in the negotiations 
with Israel. In giving Hizballah freedom of action in southern 
Lebanon, al-Asad wants to have a card to play in the 
negotiations. Lubrani said President al-Asad wants to make us 
pay to end this threat. 
  Lubrani warned that Israel will continue to strike on all 
occasions and with all means against Hizballah and other 
terrorist organizations. He indicated that any suspension of 
the talks with Syria and Lebanon would ultimately serve 
Hizballah.

<F P=106> [Report by Roger Faligot in Paris and Roman Rollnick: </F>
"Sudan Emerges As Peace Broker in Algerian Crisis"] 
  [Text] A surprise peacemaker has emerged in the continuing 
attempts to solve the Algerian crisis -- Sudan, which is still 
on Washington's blacklist as a centre of terrorism. 
  The government in Khartoum, under fire for giving shelter to 
radical Palestinian and Lebanese groups such as Hizballah, 
Hamas, and the Islamic Jihad movement, is anxious to take steps 
to end its economic and political isolation. 
  Now THE EUROPEAN has learned that senior Sudanese officials 
have recently visited France, establishing links with the French 
secret service. They have also offered to intercede in Algeria 
as its new strongman, President Lamine Zeroual, tries to open a 
dialogue with Islamic fundamentalist leaders. 
  The developments came in a week when Germany and the 
Algerian 
government seemed to be forging closer relations. As German 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met Algerian Prime Minister Redha 
Malek in Brussels, the German government tried to ban the 
fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in exile from 
involvement in "political activities" because its president, 
Rabeh Kebir, had expressed views "endangering German interests." 
  Speaking to THE EUROPEAN on condition that his whereabouts 
in 
Germany are kept secret, Kebir said that neither he nor his 
lawyer had received official notification from the German 
government: "All we know is what was reported in the media, and 
if it is true it is disappointing, as it would constitute an act 
that is biased in favour of the Algerian military dictatorship. 
We are aware, of course, that we are on the sovereign territory 
of a foreign country, and that we must abide by its laws." 
  French intelligence had talks with the FIS in Sudan in late 
1991, after elections were cancelled when it seemed that the 
fundamentalists were certain to take power. Zeroual said on 7 
February that he wanted to open discussions with FIS leaders, 
though the battle against the armed militant groups would 
continue. An alliance between the army and the dominant Islamic 
political group -- the same situation as in Sudan -- is far from 
unlikely, according to observers. 
  The FIS said it believed a peaceful solution to Algeria's 
crisis could be negotiated with Zeroual. But Rabeh Kebir said 
that a precondition had to be that the government release all 
political prisoners and "engage in serious negotiations." 
  He said: "Zeroual should not offer to negotiate while his 
war planes bomb suspected fundamentalist strongholds in the 
mountains. Either they release all our people and negotiate in 
good faith, or they don't. They cannot have it both ways." 
  The first indications of Franco-Sudanese cooperation came 
last month from the Paris-based confidential Indian Ocean 
Newsletter, which disclosed that Sudanese officials and 
ministers had come to France to negotiate commercial contracts. 
  The most extraordinary visit was that of Sudanese secret 
service chief General Hashim Abu-Sa'id. He met Colonel 
Jean-Claude Mantion, an Africa specialist in the DGSE, France's 
foreign intelligence service, who was eager to exchange 
information on countries such as the Central African Republic 
and Chad, where a new Libyan offensive is feared. 
  THE EUROPEAN has since learned that Abu-Sa'id twice came to 
France in January in connection with a partnership deal. 
Between two visits he went to his hometown of Doha and reported 
back to Khartoum headquarters. 
  He is the chief of the foreign department of the Sudanese 
intelligence service, led by fundamentalist Dr Nafi' al-Nafi', a 
former Khartoum University lecturer before the 1989 coup d'etat. 
His visits were clearly approved at the highest level of the 
Islamic National Front. Opponents of the Khartoum regime say 
they fear that in exchange for information on neighbouring 
African countries, the DGSE will provide the regime with precise 
data on and satellite pictures of the southern rebels of the 
Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). The head of the DGSE 
station in Khartoum favours the rebels, but was overruled 
because his Paris chiefs now favour a rapprochement with Sudan.

<F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Technical Sciences Professor V. </F>
Senkevich, chief of the division for comprehensive analysis of 
space hardware of TsNIIMASh [Central Scientific-Research 
Institute of Machine Building and Metalworking], under the 
rubric "Problems of the Sector": "The Horizons of Russian Space 
Science"] 
  [Text] Contemporary space science is a new form of human 
activity. It has unique capabilities to resolve practical tasks 
on a planetary scale efficiently, and to have an appreciable 
impact on many aspects of the life of society. 
  Thanks to the global nature of the operations, space 
hardware 
has a level of promptness and informativeness that is not 
available to ground systems. Only these systems make it possible 
to use properties of the environment beyond the Earth (vacuum, 
weightlessness etc.) for applied and scientific purposes, 
conduct research on surrounding space across the whole range of 
wavelengths and study the heavenly bodies that populate them, as 
well as make use of their natural resources in the future for 
the needs of mankind. 
  It is entirely likely that it will be deemed expedient to 
remove radioactive wastes with the aid of spacecraft, taking 
them to remote orbits in special containers until such time as 
we find ways of reprocessing and using those harmful substances. 
The guaranteed safe burial of radioactive wastes on Earth is 
impossible in practice, after all, at the contemporary level of 
development of science and technology. 
  The scope and level of worldwide space activity, at the same 
time, has now led to the appearance of specific problems that 
must be resolved without delay. "Space trash," for example 
(spent stages of launch vehicles, satellites, their constituent 
elements and parts and other "wastes"), has come to pose a real 
threat of collision with functioning spacecraft. The steady 
growth in the number of launches of launch vehicles requires the 
creation of ecologically clean methods of launch, and a 
reduction in the areas where the separated portions fall. 
  Domestic space science, as all of our country, is going 
through a difficult period today. A breakdown is occurring in 
cooperation that had taken shape over decades (more than a 
thousand organizations were directly active in it, and more than 
two thousand indirectly, in the former Union, although about 85 
percent of the space potential was concentrated right in 
Russia). The former command-administrative system of command and 
control and the state financial and resource support of space 
science, with all of its merits and drawbacks, has been 
destroyed, and a renewed organizational structure is being 
created in its place. The government of Russia has already made 
concrete decisions in this area, the basis of which is the 
prospect of preserving space science as a sector that performs 
important state functions. The Russian Space Agency in 
particular was formed at the beginning of 1992, and was given 
the task by presidential edict of "developing and implementing 
state policy in the realm of the study and utilization of outer 
space." 
  The problem of the right of ownership of elements of the 
space infrastructure located on their territories by the 
republics of the former Union--which never arose 
before--requires immediate settlement. 
  The financial and economic crisis and the drop in production 
in all sectors of industry are appreciably lowering the level of 
space activity. Spending declined by 35 percent in 1991 compared 
to the prior year. The work of the missile and space sector was 
effectively "frozen" for several months at the beginning of 
1992, before the confirmation of the state order. Cutbacks and 
stoppages of theoretical and experimental work (whole areas are 
threatened in some cases) are occurring as a result, highly 
skilled professionals are leaving and the system of personnel 
training is being destroyed; it will be exceedingly difficult to 
restore our "space school," which is world class. The scientific 
and experimental physical plant is in grave condition owing to 
insufficient financing. Further strengthening of these negative 
elements could lead to Russia's loss of its position as one of 
the leading space powers, which is intolerable. 
  The contemporary situation, at the same time, brings new 
opportunities as well. The change in the socio-political 
situation in the world and reduction in the level of military 
confrontation are opening up broad prospects for international 
collaboration. 
  The processes of integration that are typical of all sectors 
of the economies of developed nations are now taking place at a 
worldwide level in space activity as well. There are 
opportunities to accomplish space projects that even the 
wealthiest country is in principle not able to carry out from a 
technical standpoint, and in the realization of which all of 
mankind has a vested interest. Virtually all large-scale 
programs at the beginning of the 21st century will now be 
accomplished on the basis of international financing, and joint 
plans for their fulfillment and utilization of the results. 
There are opportunities therein for collaboration for more than 
scientific and national-economic purposes alone. Prospects are 
already being discerned, for example, for the creation of a 
space echelon of international systems of missile and space 
defense, intended for monitoring arms and ensuring global 
security under the aegis of the United Nations. 
  Intensive commercialization is being observed in 
international space science, a market for hardware, technology 
and services is forming and the initial distribution of spheres 
of influence is proceeding. It is exceptionally important for 
Russia to take its place in this process right now. Its 
participation in the world space market, unfortunately, is still 
not large. The rapid and correct determination of which elements 
of domestic engineering and services have any demand, the 
finding of customers and the development of an intelligent 
pricing policy are essential in order to win a proper place in 
that market. The concept of "profit" in the sector of space 
science should become just as common as in any other. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-02A>           Predicted Tasks and Amounts of Space Activity... </FIG>

  What awaits us in the future? The Russian Space Agency, RF 
Ministry of Defense and Ukraine Academy of Sciences, in 
conjunction with other ministries and agencies, in 1992 prepared 
a series of documents on a new space policy, and in particular 
the "State Space Program of Russia to the Year 2000." It 
envisages measures providing for the development of our 
potential, its utilization for the resolution of scientific and 
national-economic tasks and basic research, the development of 
commercial entrepreneurship in various areas of space activity 
and the receipt of a real economic impact via the creation of 
new technologies, products and services and their offering to 
other sectors. 
  The concrete forms for realizing the directions of that 
activity depend on many factors, including on predicted 
technical development trends. Three principal ones may be 
singled out. Constant expansion of the sphere of application of 
missile and space engineering should lead to the creation of 
multipurpose orbital platforms, and their use to perform a large 
number of various tasks. It would be expedient therein to begin 
the interproject standardization and modular-unit execution of 
satellites and their constituent parts. Such an approach would 
permit a 20--30 percent reduction in spending on space science. 
  The second promising trend is the development of the 
principle of reusability. The operation of not only multiple-use 
systems such as the Buran and Space Shuttle manned spacecraft, 
but also the realization of new ideas such as the recovery of 
launch vehicles and their constituent parts using an aircraft 
configuration or using parachute descent, with their repeated 
launching, is being predicted for the future. The return from 
space of individual replaceable modules and units, apparatus or 
a spacecraft as a whole that would be put back into orbit after 
ground restoration is a matter for the near future. 
  Third, an essential element of the space science of the 
future is a system of transport and technical support and repair 
in space. Hangars, warehouses and other structures located in 
orbit are needed. Automatic robotic systems fitted with 
manipulators, mobile rocket trolleys for movements in space, 
truss elements and equipment for the assembly and repair of 
large structural elements, as well as the replacement of 
individual modules and instruments on satellite platforms, 
should be of assistance. Orbital stations of the Mir type or the 
American Freedom could become the bases for accommodating such 
facilities. 
  The cost recovery and profitability of space science will be 
achieved through the direct national-economic impact (including 
from the use of dual-purpose satellites), the organization of 
commercial activity, the transfer of promising space 
technologies to other sectors and the production of consumer 
goods by the enterprises in the missile and space complex. 
  The space programs themselves, however, will become more and 
more expensive, and the formation of a system that guarantees 
objective and full information for the public on the work in the 
principal areas of space activity of Russia and provides the 
opportunity to influence public opinion on its scope and the 
choice of ways of development is thus essential. The creation 
and active work of such independent and extrabudgetary 
organizations as the Academy of Space Science imeni K.E. 
Tsiolkovskiy, the International Engineering Academy, the 
Federation of Space Science of Russia and the Moscow Space Club, 
among others, could be considered the start of that. 




    The process of assimilating and utilizing outer space is 
proceeding, and will proceed, at an increasing pace. Both the 
preservation and the development of the directions of space 
activity that have already become traditional, along with the 
appearance of new ones, is being predicted after the year 2000. 
These are, first and foremost, the development of the space 
industry in near-Earth orbits, the creation of space solar 
electric-power plants and a space echelon of the international 
system of antimissile and space defense. The building of manned 
base stations on the moon will lay the foundation for the 
practical assimilation of its natural resources, and will be the 
first step in the realization of even more large-scale projects 
for manned flights to Mars and other planets. 
  Society's need for such programs seems obvious, and will be 
satisfied only with sufficient financial and resource support 
from the state.

<F P=106> [Article by KIK [Command, Control and Telemetry Complexes] </F>
Main Center Chief Colonel Anatoliy Borisovich Zapadinskiy under 
the rubric "In the Space Units": "The Main Center"] 
  [Text] The problems of the Main Center of the 
command, control and telemetry complexes (KIKs) have been 
written about for a long time. Most features devote particular 
attention to the organizational, technical and financial issues 
connected with the collapse of the USSR. That is not surprising. 
Several of the command, control and telemetry complexes, after 
all, have ended up on the territory of states in the near 
abroad. But the KIKs are, first and foremost, a collective of 
highly skilled specialists about whom the general public knows 
virtually nothing at all. They remain outside the view of 
reporting from Baykonur, Plesetsk and the Flight Control Station 
for the Mir orbital station. 
  The journal is beginning the publication of a series of 
materials on the service of the workers at the command, control 
and telemetry complexes and their role in supporting the space 
programs and raising the combat readiness of the armed forces of 
the Russian Federation with this article by KIK Main Center 
Chief Colonel Anatoliy Borisovich Zapadinskiy. 
  The Main Center for the Testing and Control of Spacecraft is 
located near Moscow in the city of Krasnoznamensk (Golitsino-2). 
The city was closed to journalists until quite recently, and not 
just to them. Military specialists of the highest qualifications 
are on duty here around the clock--electronics experts, 
programmers, ballistics specialists, communications workers and 
many more, for whom space is the cause of their life. These 
people are responsible for the state of almost all of the 
country's orbital stations, manned or unmanned, for military, 
national-economic or scientific-research purposes. Information 
flows from twelve command, control and telemetry complexes 
located across the entire territory of the country to the Main 
Center, which is a very important part of the Military Space 
Forces of the Ministry of Defense of Russia, as well as from 
scientific-research vessels (separate ocean-going floating 
complexes) through relay satellites. The Flight Control Centers 
for the separate types of spacecraft are structurally part of 
it. They plan about 1,000 communications sessions with more than 
180 craft in orbit each day. 
  The command and control of spacecraft that are in service is 
just a part of their tasks. A second, and perhaps no lesser, 
part is to conduct flight testing of new spacecraft. The 
specialists of the Main Center perform these functions in 
collaboration with representatives of more than 150 
organizations--NIIs [scientific-research institutes], KBs 
[design bureaus], NPOs [scientific-production associations] and 
civilian agencies. 
  A satellite flies over the territory of Russia for about 20 
minutes, and the control and telemetry complexes are "receiving 
them" and "handing them over" to each other successively along 
the entire track, each of them having its own zone of radio 
visibility with a certain overlap; the control of the craft thus 
continuously passes "by relay." And so it goes around the clock. 
  The collectives, supervised by Colonels V. Kovalev, A. 
Kotenko, V. Artemenko, N. Kolesnikov, I. Lopatin and V. Pestov, 
are successfully accomplishing the tasks assigned to them under 
difficult conditions. There are 67 officers with academic 
degrees of doctor or candidate of sciences currently serving at 
the Main Center. They are making a large contribution to the 
scientific-research work of the command and control centers. I 
would like to note among them S. Ryapolov, O. Pudovkin, O. 
Yefremov, M. Grekhov and Ya. Abdulov first and foremost. 
  The uninitiated reader could ask, "What do I in particular, 
and the country in general, need with space science, since it 
costs enormous amounts of money?" I will try to answer that. 
  When you open up a recent newspaper, turn on the television 
or reserve a telephone conversation with a different city, you 
scarcely give any thought to the fact that space telerelay 
currently supports the transmission of Channel 1 from Ostankino 
for 97.2 percent of the population and the Russia Channel for 90 
percent, 29 cities receive images of newspaper column layouts 
through satellites, and telephone, telegraph, facsimile and 
other forms of communications are accomplished by satellite. The 
economic impact from the use of those means alone is about 1.5 
billion rubles a year.[.sup]1[/] 
  Orbital weather stations provide timely warning of dangerous 
natural phenomena, and markedly improve the accuracy of 
forecasts. The annual economic impact from their use totals more 
than 500 million rubles, and the research data on natural 
resources about 700 million. More figures from the realm of 
space meteorology: one satellite receives more information in 90 
minutes (the average duration of one orbit around the Earth) 
than 1,500 weather stations around the world. The possibility of 
forecasting the weather two weeks in advance, according to the 
estimates of UN experts (and they can scarcely be suspected of 
bias), could provide an annual economy of about nine billion 
dollars on a worldwide scale. That figure is 600--700 million 
rubles a year apropos of our country. 
  Take, by way of example, an area of space science such as 
researching the natural resources of the Earth from space. This 
is a gold mine! The high-precision cataloguing of pasturelands 
and tracts of timber, predictions of spring water runoff and 
harvest levels of grains, after all, also exist aside from the 
aforementioned "line items" of income. 
  They have long since learned to count "space" money abroad. 
They know very well there that the cost of one photograph that 
encompasses 185 km[.sup]2[/] of the Earth's surface in 
stereoscopic form costs more than 4,000 dollars. The 
productivity of one spacecraft is more than 30,000 pictures a 
year. 
  Less than four billion rubles a year were being allocated 
for 
space programs by the former USSR in 1990-91. This is roughly 
half the spending of the state for tobacco products, and one 
seventh of that for alcoholic beverages. 
  The sensible voices of specialists from many of the agencies 
in whose interests the dozens of spacecraft and thousands of KIK 
specialists are working are most unfortunately not always heard 
against the background of the shrill declarations of some 
"people's patrons" who are calling for reductions and cuts in 
the space programs. They have been cut back as a whole. And what 
of it? Was there a spurt in some other sector of the national 
economy? No. Would it not thus be easier at least to preserve 
what we have, and find a worthy and economically advantageous 
application for it? We cannot in fact return to the plow and 
torch, leaving the country without communications, television, 
navigation, meteorological observations and many others services 
that often go unnoticed that are offered by space science. 
  Many forget, when talking about the commercialization of 
space science and its cost recovery, that there is also another 
aspect that for us, servicemen, is the main one, whatever else 
may be said on this score. 
  The positive changes in the world have naturally lessened 
international tensions appreciably. But the dissolution of the 
NATO alliance did not follow the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, 
and no substantial changes are taking place in the military 
doctrines and strategic concepts of the United States and the 
NATO countries. 
  Each looks after his own, as they say. It is the business of 
policy makers and diplomats to provide for the security of the 
state using peaceful means. It is the business of the military 
to support those efforts. How can space science help? The 
responsibility of military space science is global 
high-precision navigation, communications, the command and 
control of troops, operational all-weather reconnaissance and 
warnings of nuclear-missile attack, the monitoring of "hot 
spots" and the course of fulfillment of treaty obligations. We 
will be candid- -the space assets, in performing the total 
monitoring of the situation around the world, play a dual role. 
The national space assets of the great powers, on the one hand, 
foster a strengthening of strategic stability and 
confidence-building measures among peoples and, on the other, 
increase the combat capabilities of the troops by one-and-a-half 
to two times. The on-board apparatus of the reconnaissance 
satellites, in orbits of 300 km or more, in fact have resolution 
that allows them to see objects of just several dozen 
centimeters. Measurement data from special spacecraft are used 
to create the digital terrain maps that constitute the 
foundation of the flight assignments of the newest strategic 
arms systems. For cruise missiles this signifies the guaranteed 
hitting of the target with a deviation of no more than ten 
meters. 
  The operations of the United States in the war with Iraq is 
an example of this. They have in operational use 17 supporting 
space systems for military purposes today. These are satellites 
for imaging, infrared, radio and radar reconnaissance on global 
and regional scales, the monitoring of outer space and the 
warning of nuclear-missile attack, communications, combat 
command and control and navigational, topogeodesic and 
meteorological support. The U.S. Department of Defense could 
bring in civilian space assets as well when needed. 
  I would like to emphasize here the substantial difference of 
our "space system" from the American one. We have no separate 
military and civilian space science. The spacecraft, regardless 
of their purpose, are thus prepared and launched from one and 
the same cosmodromes by one and the same launch vehicles. Ground 
stations and information-computer complexes belonging to the 
Ministry of Defense of Russia control them. Why not now split up 
the zones of responsibility and turn over national- economic and 
scientific space science to civilian agencies, leaving the 
military with purely their own tasks? With time, when private 
companies begin to invest funds in space science, this could 
become a reality, but now--we will be realistic--there is not 
one civilian specialist who would go to work and live at a 
cosmodrome or ground telemetry station for the same money, and 
under the same conditions, as our officers. Colossal funds will 
be required in order to create a separate civilian space 
science. I think that this question will not be considered in 
the near future. Thanks to the fact that domestic space science 
is being kept on the backs of servicemen--whose monetary 
sustenace is less than the wages of a trolley driver--living in 
God-forsaken places and who do not have normal housing, but do 
not go on strike nonetheless, it remains with those few that are 
still working uninterruptedly here. 
  We are constantly called upon to perform tasks associated 
with maintaining the combat readiness of the armed forces of the 
Russian Federation. And that is not easy work. Dozens of 
spacecraft for various purposes are prepared and launched at our 
cosmodromes every year, and the KIK Main Center is constantly 
controlling the spacecraft in orbit. The military people work 
with such far from military spacecraft as the Molniya and 
Gorizont (communications), Tsikada (navigation), Meteor and 
Resurs (meteorology and remote sounding of the Earth) and 
scientific satellites. They support the launch and control of 
all manned flights. And meanwhile no one removes their main 
task-- ensuring the security of the Fatherland. 
  The cutbacks in the personnel of space units that were 
carried out in directive fashion a few years ago have created a 
situation close to critical. Many officers at the command, 
control and telemetry complexes put in day-long duty a day 
later, are brought in for additional work at night and take part 
in controlling communications sessions for two or three days 
without a break. The psychophysical burdens are enormous. 
Operations where each mistake could caused millions in losses to 
the state are performed during these sessions. 
  It would be convenient here to mention the prospects for the 
development of the KIK Main Center and questions of the social 
protections for the people who are serving the Fatherland--to 
its "greater glory," as they said in the old days. The 
prospects, strange as it may be, are defined by our problems. 
The facilities of the space infrastructure are located on the 
territory of five states of the CIS (Russia, Kazakhstan, 
Ukraine, Belarus and Uzbekistan). Only one of those--Russia--is 
able to carry out space activity independently. Kazakhstan, 
where Baykonur is located, does not have any space industry and 
cannot operate the cosmodrome independently of the other states. 
There are missile- building plants on the territory of Ukraine, 
but no cosmodrome. So what is the way out? Operations in the 
realm of space science must be organized in a new fashion, and 
coordinated with the space programs of sovereign states and the 
international space program. Such programs are expediently 
developed from the perspective of a decade, since the cycle for 
the creation and series production of space assets is 7--10 
years. The necessity of a state program is conditioned by two 
factors. Some space systems, first of all (meteorological, 
navigational etc.), could serve a virtually unlimited number of 
consumers in all parts of the Commonwealth. It would not be 
expedient to create them for each state separately. Second, the 
centralized financing of military and international space 
programs should be preserved, from the economic and technical 
points of view. 
  An International Aerospace Committee (MAKK) must be formed. 
It could be entrusted with the functions of general customer of 
international space projects, as well as being the body that 
determines the degree of participation of states in shared 
financing for the creation and operation of space assets for 
dual purposes. 
  Responsibility for the fulfillment of the international 
space 
program should be charged to the Military Space Forces of the 
Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, entrusting it 
with ordering and operating space assets for military and dual 
purposes. The involvement of space units in realizing the plans 
of space agencies of the sovereign states and the MAKK could be 
accomplished on a contract basis, with compensation for the 
expenditures of military organizations for the creation and 
operation of the hardware, as well as the maintenance of the 
service personnel.

Menshikov under the rubric "Cosmodromes: Rockets and People": 
"Baykonur"] 
  [Text] Taking into account reader interest in the 
previously closed topic of the locations, layout of the 
facilities and activity of the Military-Space Forces of the 
Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, we are beginning 
the publication of materials on the cosmodromes. 
  The Baykonur cosmodrome is an enormous scientific and 
technical complex. It is located on desert terrain in the 
central portion of Kyzyl-Orda Oblast. About 40 rockets for space 
purposes and up to 10 intercontinental ballistic missiles are 
launched from it every year. 
  The grounds of the cosmodrome (which extend 85 km from north 
to south and 125 km from west to east) have launch pads and 
engineering positions, receiving and transmission centers, 
wireline communications centers, storage areas for rocket and 
space hardware, fuel components, systems for electric-power, 
heat and water supply, an oxygen-nitrogen plant--one of the 
largest in the world for the production of cryogenic 
products--and other facilities. Baykonur is comparable in the 
scale of production and consumption of electric power to a 
sovereign state such as Moldova. The cosmodrome has five 
telemetry stations and a computer center, as well as nine 
telemetry stations along the flight paths of the launch vehicles 
for 1,500 km along the territory of Kazakhstan and Russia, as 
well as areas for the spent stages to fall. 
  The population of the city of Leninsk and the residential 
compounds of the centers for the preparation of launch vehicles 
and spacecraft for launch fluctuates, depending on the tasks 
being performed, from 120,000 to 150,000 people. 



  All of the facilities are traditionally divided by the 
residents of Baykonur into "ten," the "left" and "right" flanks 
and the "center." 
  "Ten." The city has a quite well-developed 
infrastructure-- the Krayniy airfield, a TETs [heat and 
electric-power plant] (12 power boilers and eight turbines), 
branches of the MAI [Moscow Aviation Institute] imeni S. 
Ordzhonikidze and the Progress Plant (city of Samara), a 
bread-baking plant, movie theaters, a swimming pool, a 
television station, communications and domestic-services 
enterprises and various sights, as well as parks and squares 
that are artificially irrigated in the summertime. 
  "Left flank." The launch and engineering complexes 
for the Tsiklon and Proton launch vehicles and the spacecraft 
that they put into orbit is located about 70 km northwest of the 
city of Leninsk. 
  Elements of the former are located in compact fashion at a 
single site. The rocket itself is exceptionally reliable. 
Created by the KB [design bureau] under the supervision of 
Academician M. Yangel in the middle of the 1960s, it has not 
suffered a single accident right up to the present day. The 
launch complex is convenient to operate and highly automated. 
Satellites with nuclear power plants were launched from here in 
the 1970s, which caused great unpleasantness when they failed in 
orbit. They are no longer employed today. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-07A>           Map </FIG>

  The principal rocket and space complex for which the "left" 
flank is renowned is the Proton. It includes two launch areas 
with four launch pads, a refueling and neutralization station 
and an engineering position with two installation and testing 
wings. The residential compound is designed for 10,000 people. 
  "Center." The launch and engineering structures 
for the Soyuz and Energiya launch vehicles, the spacecraft they 
put into orbit and the Buran orbital vessel are all located here. 
  The famous "two," with the Gagarin launch pad, two 
installation and testing wings, a hotel, guest cottages, a 
museum of cosmonautics and the cabins of S. Korolev and Yu. 
Gagarin, is located 30 km from Leninsk. The daring assault on 
the universe began here. Soviet and many international crews 
that brought honor to our state "left" for orbit from this 
launch pad. 
  The ground elements of the Energiya/Buran reusable space 
system are located alongside "two," where the structures of the 
king of rockets-- the N-1--run along the main road for a 
distance of more than 15 km. The launching set-up, a service 
tower shortened by 60 meters and the moving portion of the 
rocket erectors have been partially utilized from the N-1 
equipment. All the rest had to be created anew. This most 
complicated ground complex occupies an area of more than 10 
km[.sup]2[/]. It consists of several dozen structures and 
more than 50 technological and 200 engineering systems. Two 
identical launch pads are located here. They are served by a 
cryogenic center located to the north, with storage areas 
(spherical containers 12 meters in diameter) for liquid oxygen 
and hydrogen and gaseous nitrogen and helium (pressure in the 
tanks 400 atmospheres). 
  The launch structure goes down five stories. It is a 
reinforced- concrete structure with monitoring and check-out 
apparatus, elevator equipment, massive protective doors weighing 
two tonnes apiece, a gas offtake port 20 meters in diameter, 
three gas offtake channels 23 meters deep and two masts 64 
meters high. One of them is for refueling and drainage. One 
feature of it is that it has a platform that is removed only 
after the start of rocket movement, so as not to permit the 
displacement of the hydrogen with atmospheric air, the formation 
of "knall gas" and an explosion. The other tower is intended for 
putting the orbital crew into the spacecraft, or for their 
emergency evacuation through two elevator tubes that lead to 
bunkers. One tube has a lift and a rail car designed for twelve 
people, for bringing the cosmonauts up. The other is for 
emergency evacuation, in which people slide downward in a 
sitting position as in an ice slide. Each crew member lands in a 
separate bunker below, with a closing iron door. 
  Two railroad tracks 18 meters apart run to the launch 
structure. The reusable space system is delivered along them to 
the pad by four powerful diesel engines from the installation 
and refueling wing on a placement unit. The total weight of the 
moving structure is about 10,000 tonnes. 
  The launch-complex systems are automated, and are controlled 
from a command post located five kilometers away. It is a 
three-story subsurface building with an enormous (100 x 50 
meters) central hall. The electric power consumed at the launch 
pad during times of operation would be enough for a city of a 
hundred thousand. The composition of the reusable space system, 
apart from the pad, includes a general- purpose pad intended for 
launches of the Energiya/Buran system, as well as the test-bed 
and technological testing of rockets, firing and post- flight 
testing of its side units as part of the technological package 
and test beds for the Energiya with a mock-up of the Buran 
orbital vessel. It was built before the launch complexes. 
  The landing complex is located 12 km northwest of the pad. 
The runway is unique, with a length of 4,500 meters and a width 
of 84 meters. The surfacing is up to half a meter thick. The 
deviation from the horizontal is no more than three millimeters 
on a three-meter section of the runway's length, which is a 
third of that at the international airfield at Sheremetyevo. The 
servicing and engineering area of the landing complex supports 
the unloading of fuel components from the orbital craft, loading 
operations and the storage of ground servicing equipment. 
Stations for the receipt and processing of telemetric 
information, a main hall for control and analysis, a set of 
navigational and landing systems, a meteorological center and an 
ornithological service are accommodated in a six-story combined 
command and dispatching station. 
  The engineering complex for the Energiya and Buran includes 
operational and production zones located 40 km from the city of 
Leninsk and 5 km from the launch pad. 
  The operational zone is made up of an installation and 
refueling wing, a refueling station and a pyrotechnics station, 
while the production wing has an installation and testing wing 
for the launch vehicle and the orbital craft. All of these 
structures are of truly cosmic dimensions. The installation and 
testing wing for the Energiya, for instance, was built for the 
N-1 launch vehicle, and is the largest building at the 
cosmodrome. It is 240 meters long, 190 meters wide and 47 meters 
high. There are more than 2,000 people working in it during 
periods of intensive preparations. The installation and testing 
wing for the Buran is a structure 225 meters long, 121 meters 
wide and 30 meters high. The Buran complex also has a 
dynamic-testing test bed--a building more than 100 meters high. 
  The barracks and residential compound is able to hold up to 
20,000 people, residing there permanently or coming in for 
temporary duty of several years. 
  "Right" flank. A second complex for "seven," 
analogous to the Gagarin launch pad, is located 50 km southeast 
of the city of Leninsk. It entered service in 1960 and was 
intended as a back-up for "two," and was built with a regard for 
prevailing experience--the excavation was twice as large, and 
the installation and testing wings and the residential areas 
were brought closer to the locations for the preparation and 
launch of the launch vehicles and spacecraft. Manned launches 
were also made here, but it was primarily spacecraft for 
interplanetary flights--Venera, Mars, Phobos and Vega, among 
others-- that were prepared here. More than 330 launches were 
made in all. 
  Ten kilometers from this pad is the Zenit complex, 
consisting 
of a launch installation, a cryogenic center and more than 50 
technological systems. All of the operations in the 
transporting, placement of the rocket on the launch 
installation, hook-up of electrical and air lines and fueling 
are performed automatically, and the rocket can be launched an 
hour and a half after placement. Service towers will be put into 
operation at the launch pad, through which the placement of the 
cosmonauts into the craft will be accomplished, when the Zenit 
becomes the principal launch vehicle for manned space flight, 
replacing the famed "seven." 
  The cosmodrome is in a difficult situation today, suffering 
from shortages of people, resources and funds and experiencing 
organizational and financial difficulties. The future of space 
science for the CIS countries depends on how these problems are 
resolved in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Technical Sciences V. Vlasov under </F>
the rubric "Space Science for the National Economy": "The 
Gonets of 'SmalSat'"] 
  [Text] The development and adoption of satellite 
communications systems using geostationary orbits and small 
ground receiving stations is underway in many of the developed 
countries. Even the smallest stations, however, have antennas 
that are one to three meters in diameter, weigh several dozen 
kilograms and cost 20,000--50,000 dollars, as well as requiring 
skilled servicing and being inaccessible to the mass user. 
Further improvements in the characteristics of the ground 
terminals and provision for their widespread accessibility are 
possible only by making the satellites substantially more 
complicated, giving them antennas on the order of 30 meters in 
diameter, power consumption of several kilowatts, mass of four 
to six tonnes and expensive means of launch. 
  Broad research has been launched of late to create space 
communications systems using low-orbital satellites located much 
closer to the Earth than geostationary ones, requiring smaller 
power expenditures for the transmission of messages on the part 
of both the spacecraft and the ground stations. This would make 
it possible to provide communications between personal terminals 
that are close in complexity, dimension and weight 
characteristics to police mobile communications sets. 
  All of the low-orbit space communications systems that are 
now being developed can be divided into systems for the packet 
transmission of data and radio-telephone communications. They 
are distinguished by the services offered and the complexity of 
technical realization. 
  The former group includes such systems as the Gonets 
project, 
developed by the NII [Scientific-Research Institute] of Thermal 
Processes (Moscow) and the NPO [Scientific-Production 
Association] of Applied Mechanics (Krasnoyarsk). The customer is 
the SmalSat Intersector Business Association. The system should 
unfold in stages, will enter service in 1994-96 and will make it 
possible to transmit any messages in digital form (telex, text 
or image), exchange information between databases and computers 
and gather information from environmental monitoring systems or 
personal queries of subscribers, as well as determine the 
location of a mobile terminal and transmit that information to 
the center. 
  Some waiting time for a communications session could be 
permitted when offering services through this system, and strict 
demands will not be posed for the promptness of information 
transmission. An orbital group of satellites without a complex 
system for orientation and stabilization is thus not used when 
it is deployed. This makes it possible to refrain from using 
engine installations on the spacecraft, and to employ the 
simplest (gravitational) single-axis orientation system. The 
number of craft in the system is determined by the parameters of 
the orbit and the time for the waiting and delivery of 
information. The satellites are distributed on six orbital 
planes that are spread equally across the longitudes of the 
ascending node. The group could be controlled from a single 
point. 
  The 312--315 MHz and 387--390 MHz low-frequency bands 
allotted for the Gonets system, and the circular orbits at 
altitudes of 1,300--1,500 km that were selected, make it 
possible to employ wide-beam antennas with a gain of up to three 
decibels and transmitters with a power of 2--10 watts on the 
spacecraft. 
  The packet mode of data transmission, first of all, makes it 
possible to conserve power for the satellite and the receiving 
station and, second and most importantly, to conduct the 
communications sessions over brief time intervals using one 
satellite, without coordinating the operations of regional 
stations for session times. This simplifies considerably the 
organization of communications. 
  The adoption of these principles for structuring the 
low-orbital system of data transmission had the following 
results. The Gonets is indeed small and inexpensive. The low 
weight of the satellite (220 kg) and low orbits make it possible 
to arrange the orbital group by means of the simultaneous launch 
of six craft by a single Tsiklon launch vehicle. This determined 
the low cost of creating the space segment. The ground terminals 
make it possible to allow untrained support, and are oriented 
toward the user, cheap and do not require a far-flung 
infrastructure of ground communications lines. 
  Communications are conducted in close to real time within a 
region whose diameter is less than 5,000 km (the radio 
visibility footprint of one satellite). This occurs as follows. 
The spacecraft periodically emits a marker signal that contains 
the technological information necessary for a subscriber to 
establish communications (Fig. 1). During a time interval when 
the whole region is in the zone of radio visibility of the 
satellite, an address flag of the given region appears in the 
marker signal and the stationary (AT-S) and mobile (AT) 
terminals exchange information between themselves (the waiting 
time for a communications session is no more than 20 minutes, 
with a probability of 0.8). The address flag can be formed by 
computer gear on the spacecraft or a regional station (RS). The 
latter method is simpler, and has been adopted in the Gonets 
system. 




    If the subscribers are in different regions, the information 
is transmitted in the "space mail" mode. The message transmitted 
to the satellite is recorded and transmitted to the recipient 
when he appears in the zone of radio visibility of the 
spacecraft. The average time to deliver information in that case 
does not exceed three to six hours. 
  The Gonets system provides for determination of the position 
of mobile subscribers, and the transmission of that information 
to the centers of the corresponding services. Two variations are 
possible. The use of terminals from the Glonass or GPS 
navigational systems is necessary for mobile targets that 
require determination of the geographical coordinates with a 
precision of a few meters. The terminals are hooked up using the 
standard RS-232 interface. If a precision of just 1--7 
kilometers is required, the Gonets terminal is employed 
directly; it performs calculations based on measurements of the 
Doppler frequencies at several points in the satellite orbit and 
the current parameters of its movement. 
  The launch of two experimental Gonets-D satellites was made 
on 13 July 1992 in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the 
Gonets system and to try out the principles of its operation. 
The experimental system can currently function successfully in 
the mode of regional communications between the cities of 
Cheboksary--Izhevsk--Moscow, as well as in the "space mail" mode 
between Melbourne and Moscow. The launch of six Gonets-D1 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-10A>           Fig. 1. </FIG>

experimental satellites in 1993 is being proposed to offer 
services to actual users. 
  The class of low-orbital systems for radio-telephone 
communications includes the Gonets-R project, which in addition 
to the indicated services provides for the exchange of voice 
messages with the use of personal radio-telephones. 
  The specific nature of the structure of the low-orbital 
systems of radio-telephone communications is determined by the 
requirement for uninterrupted support for users in real time. 
The orbital group should provide a constant scan of a service 
zone of the Earth's surface with a probability of no worse than 
0.995 accordingly. 
  These features require the use of an orbital group of 
controllable satellites, the realization of a three-axis 
orientation system on the spacecraft and equipping them with 
engines. These craft turn out to be complex and expensive, and 
weigh no less than 400 kg. The group has to be controlled from 
several points, while the assurance of uninterrupted 
communications would require a large quantity of regional 
stations with expensive switching equipment. The cost of the 
system, according to some estimates, would exceed the cost of 
the packet data transmission system by 10--100 times. 
  Great interest is being displayed in low-orbital 
radio-telephone communications systems around the world. This is 
caused by the fact that cellular telephony systems using 
personal radio telephones, by and large, function in regions 
with medium or high population density and cannot offer their 
services in other regions, as well as to means of transport that 
are traveling across enormous territories. 
  The number of users of a low-orbital radio-telephone 
communications system, according to the estimates of experts, 
could reach several millions by the year 2000. This is roughly 
100 times less than the number of users of cellular telephone 
systems. They will thus not be competing with the cellular 
telephone systems, but rather supplementing them. 
  Taking this into account, it is essential that the technical 
gear be compatible with cellular telephony and voice 
communications that are accomplished through personal or 
portable radio telephones. The maximum utilization of the proven 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-11A>           Fig. 2. </FIG>

technologies of cellular systems will reduce the cost of 
creating the system as a whole, and will provide additional 
conveniences for the users. 
  The requirement for global servicing of users in real time 
could be met with the use of intersatellite communications 
channels in the system, or the means of other systems without 
them. The choice of method is made proceeding from the traffic 
(intensity) of user operations. Up to 90 percent of the traffic, 
as a rule, lies in a service zone of the Earth's surface of 
4,000--5,000 km in diameter, and the variation for arranging the 
communications system without intersatellite channels is 
preferable. 
  The placement of a regional station in each such region is 
required, in that case, to support communications (Fig. 2); it 
maintains communications with all of the satellites covering the 
given region with their antenna patterns. The regional station 
links the subscribers of the system with each other through 
satellite channels within the given region, as well as provides 
connections with the subscribers of other regions or with 
subscribers of general-use networks by involving the means of 
other systems. 




    This organization of communications assumes that all of the 
subscriber connections are made through the regional station. 
The relay on the satellite should be without signal demodulation 
and decoding therein. The spacecraft is simplified, and various 
regions can operate with various coordinating devices (network 
protocols), providing an opportunity to utilize all existing 
switching equipment and simplify the creation of the system. 
  The SmalSat Association is currently studying questions of 
creating the low-orbital Gonets-R radio-telephone communications 
system using the indicated principles. The following preliminary 
results have been obtained. The space segment should consist of 
an adjustable orbital group of 45 satellites located on five 
planes of nine spacecraft each. The planes are 36 apart in 
ascending node longitude, and are polar circular orbits at an 
altitude of 1,500 km. The orbital group selected will provide 
for continuous coverage of a global service zone with an 
elevation of 10 with a probability of no less than 0.995. 
The satellites will have a mass of no more than 950 kg, an 
average energy consumption of 640 watts per orbit and an active 
existence of five years. A thirteen-beam antenna system with a 
gain of 8--13.5 decibels will be used on the spacecraft with 
subscriber radio lines (15--16 GHz band), while those with trunk 
radio lines (11--14 GHz band) will have a wide-beam antenna 
system with a gain of up to six decibels. 
  The parameters of the orbital group and the satellite will 
support the operation of 24,500--28,080 digital voice channels 
(546-624 per craft) with an information speed of 6.5 kB/sec in a 
frequency band of 5.5--11.7 MHz for subscriber radio lines and 
38.5--81.9 MHz for trunk lines. The system will employ 
multiple-station access with time (MDRR) and frequency (MDChR) 
channel separation. The number of carrier frequencies on all 
radio lines is 39. 
  The Gonets-R system could go into service in 1997-2000, but 
additional study aimed at confirming its economic expediency is 
required before a final decision is made.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kaliningrad College of Space Machine </F>
Building and Technology Director Petr Stepanovich Timoshchenko 
and deputy for educational work Valentin Vasilyevich 
Nikolayevets by AVIATSIYA I KOSMONAVTIKA correspondent 
Lieutenant-Colonel V. Makismovskiy under the rubric "The Future 
is Being Born Today": "The Next Shift"] 
  [Text] All who work in space science are bothered by 
the question of who will come into this sector tomorrow--and 
will they come at all? This concern is elicited by the fact that 
this intellectually capacious form of human activity is today 
losing its attraction owing to the low pay. Time will pass, and 
the prestige of the "space" professions will be restored. But 
won't the potential created over decades be lost? Many people, 
despite the difficulties, are countering this destructive 
process by their deeds to keep this from happening. Among them 
are those who train the cadres for space science. 
  Our correspondent Lieutenant-Colonel V. Maksimovskiy 
visited Kaliningrad near Moscow and met with the director of the 
College of Space Machine Building and Technology, P. 
Timoshchenko, and his deputy for educational work V. 
Nikolayevets. 
  [V. Maksimovskiy] First a little history, Petr Stepanovich. 
  [P.S. Timoshchenko] The very first steps in the development 
and manufacture of ballistic missiles in the postwar years 
showed that one cannot manage such a complex matter without the 
purposeful training of specialists. This pertained first and 
foremost to those who are engaged in production. Skilled people 
trained in new fields and the chiefs of sections and shops were 
needed. Chief Designer Sergey Pavlovich Korolev understood that 
very well. He came forward to the Ministry of Armaments of the 
USSR with an initiative to create an evening technical school 
based on Trade School No. 3 at NII-88 [Scientific-Research 
Institute 88], today the Machine Building TsNII [Central NII]. 
Then Minister D. Ustinov, taking into account the importance of 
the task, on 15 March 1947 signed an order to organize a branch 
of the Moscow Military- Mechanical Technical School with evening 
training in the city of Kaliningrad. 
  The first graduation of degreed mechanical technicians, 
design engineers and technicians for electronic equipment took 
place four years later. Among them were Georgiy Mikhaylovich 
Paukov, Viktor Andreyevich Frolov, later deputy chief designers, 
along with future chiefs of the famous shop where the spacecraft 
were and are assembled--Vladimir Ivanovich Zudinov, Grigoriy 
Markovich Markov and Konstantin Georgiyevich Gorbatenko. Valeriy 
Vasilyevich Ryumkin, today a famous pilot and cosmonaut of the 
USSR and twice Hero of the Soviet Union, completed the school in 
1958. 
  [V. Maksimovskiy] So your educational institution has 
existed 
as a branch for a long time? 
  [P.S. Timoshchenko] A day division was organized after the 
first graduation, and the branch was re-organized into the 
Kaliningrad Mechanical Technical School. Korolev knew how 
important it was to maintain a contemporary level of 
sophistication for the teaching laboratories and constant and 
direct contacts of the trainees with the enterprises where they 
would be working, and he did everything necessary. Missiles and 
test beds on which the designers themselves studied, an engine 
installation from the V-2, a Schmetterling cruise missile, 
prototypes of Soviet missiles and much more were transferred 
there at his orders. These traditions have been preserved. The 
Soyuz spacecraft, a lunar landing module and a lunar orbital 
craft have also appeared here with us. 
  A noteworthy instructional collective has been formed here 
since the very beginning. N. Vorontsov, V. Postnikov, M. Rusov, 
M. Belin, M. Zimin, M. Khokhlov, A. Shalashov and others 
conducted special topics, while A. Khokhlova, A. Pyankov, S. 
Pomyalov, B. Rukavishnikov and A. Kirimova (and not only they) 
handled general education. We recalled our veterans warmly when 
celebrating the 45th anniversary of the school-- Hero of the 
Soviet Union A. Turikov, T. Tikhonova, L. Kabakova, V. 
Belyayeva, N. Kostyukova, V. Lavrentsov and L. Yudicheva, among 
others, along with the first directors--S. Malnikov, S. 
Shcherbakov and Yu. Klimov. They were the ones whose labor 
created the technical school and its traditions. 
  Classes were held and are held by specialists from 
Kaliningrad defense industries, aside from the permanent 
instructional personnel--from the Energiya NPO 
[Scientific-Production Association], the Machine Building TsNII, 
the Chemical Machine Building KB [Design Bureau], the 
Measurement Engineering NPO and the Kompozit NPO. Technological 
and pre-diploma practice takes place there for our students--the 
places they will later be working. Approximately two thirds of 
our graduates, by the way, have linked their activity with those 
enterprises, either permanently or for a long time. 
  [V. Maksimovskiy] Today your "personnel plant" has a 
different name. Why? 
  [P.S. Timoshchenko] The high level of instruction and 
sophistication of the teaching process made it possible for the 
technical school to become the Kaliningrad College of Space 
Machine Building and Technology. This is not just a new name, 
but a new quality as well. 
  [V. Maksimovskiy] I would like to address these questions to 
your deputy. Valentin Vasilyevich, do you train a great many 
specialists? 
  [V.V. Nikolayevets] We have about a thousand and a half 
people training here. It is instructive that there have not been 
fewer candidates in recent years, the passing score on entrance 
exams is 8--9 for various fields, and we have many of them: 
industrial engineer for the cold machining of metals, technician 
for rocket engines or for airframes, programmer, radio 
technician and control systems instruments, clerk. 
  There are also fields that have appeared owing to the 
necessity of working under the new economic conditions and 
conversion. These are specialists in orthopedic engineering, and 
in management and marketing. 
  [V. Maksimovskiy] The latter is clear enough--you can't go 
into the market without such training. But the former is quite 
unusual. 
  [V.V. Nikolayevets] The fact that one of the most important 
directions in the conversion of the Energiya NPO is the creation 
of prosthetic and orthotic hardware using advanced space 
technologies prompted us to engage in the training of 
technicians for the most varied, complex and modern prostheses. 
V. Legostayev, Deputy General Designer Yu. Semenova and Frau N. 
Riedrich--a representative of the German firm of JPOS, which is 
collaborating with the Energiya NPO in this noble cause--helped 
us a great deal in "discovering" this new field. 
  [V. Maksimovskiy] Valentin Vasilyevich, tell us about the 
problems that you are encountering in training personnel and 
your views of the future. 
  [V.V. Nikolayevets] The structural restructuring that our 
country is undergoing today, in my opinion, has affected the 
non-production sphere and the defense sectors for which we train 
specialists first and foremost. There is uncertainty in 
financing, and in the quantity of them needed. The attempt to 
make an abrupt transition to a market economy has led to the 
fact that existing ties have been disrupted. Everyone is 
"getting by" as best he can, and it must be said not always 
efficiently. We naturally worry about the fate of our 
educational institution. The unique laboratory base and skilled 
instructional collective cannot be lost. That has not happened 
yet, but the base fields are being displaced by others in some 
places, often out of opportunistic considerations. But I think 
this is a temporary matter. New and objectively essential fields 
will appear, but will those in which we have trained, and are 
training, the young people be preserved or resurrected? The 
spiral of the development of society will move out of the 
shadows and into the light. 
  [V. Maksimovskiy] I share your optimism. Success to your 
collective, students and graduates!

<F P=106> [Article by I. Afanasyev under the rubric "Information for </F>
Reflection": "Reusable Spacecraft"] 
  [Text] After the completion of the Apollo moon 
program at the beginning of the 1970s, the U.S. National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department 
of Defense launched the design engineering of the Space Shuttle 
reusable space transport system (MTKS). The decision was made in 
the USSR to create a transport system for analogous purposes in 
order to preserve parity, although the conceptual framework for 
air/space craft had begun to be developed here before the 
Americans--since the beginning of the 1960s. 
<H6>  Space Shuttle </H6>
  Crew. Two astronaut/pilots and up to five flight 
specialists. 
  Composition. The Space Shuttle MTKS has an orbital 
aircraft (OS), an external fuel tank (VTB) and two solid-fuel 
launch boosters (STU), sometimes called the first stage. The 
sole non-reusable element of the system is the VTB. 
  Flight configuration. The three propulsion ZhRDs 
[liquid-fuel rocket engines] of the OS and STU are ignited from 
the moment of launch. The MTKS is launched vertically. The spent 
STUs separate from the VTB and drop into the Atlantic Ocean by 
parachute. The OS continues flight using its own propulsion 
ZhRDs, and after the fuel in the VTB is expended the tank 
separates from the OS and burns up in the atmosphere. The 
aircraft is brought into orbit using the ZhRD of the orbital 
maneuvering system (SOM), which operates using storable 
hypergolic fuel. The MTKS is controlled on the injection section 
by rolling the propulsion ZhRDs in swivel suspensions and 
deflecting the STU nozzles in an elastomeric (flexible) bearing. 
The OS is controlled in orbit by the ZhRDs of the low-thrust 
rocket control system (RSU), which operates, like the SOM 
engines, using storable hypergolic fuel and is installed in the 
nose and in two rear sections. The OS, upon completion of 
orbital operations, is slowed by the SOM engines, enters the 
atmosphere and makes an aerodynamic controlled descent, a glide 
and a horizontal landing with inoperative engines. The RSU are 
used when leaving orbit and flying in the upper layers of the 
atmosphere, and the aerodynamic control surfaces enter into 
operation to the extent of the descent of the OS. The crew 
pilots the OS on the glide and landing legs. 
  Design. The wing is a low-mounted delta wing with 
dual sweep on the leading edge, split ailerons on the trailing 
edge and without any means of mechanization. The fuselage is a 
semimonocoque design with flat sides. It consists of three 
parts--the nose holds a two-level airtight cockpit for the crew 
and a compartment for the electronics gear, the middle has a 
non-airtight cargo bay (OPN), under which runs the central 
torsion box of the wing, and in the rear is the compartment for 
the main engine installation (ODU), the SOM nacelles and the 
swept tail with a split rudder. The lower portion of the rear 
tail section has a balancing flap under the fuselage, which 
plays the role of an air brake along with the rudder during 
landing. The airframe was constructed principally of aluminum 
alloys. The doors of the OPN and the fairing of the SOM nacelles 
are manufactured of graphite-epoxy composite materials (KM); the 
strength elements of the tail fin are made of boron-aluminum KM, 
and the seating frame for the main ZhRDs of boron- epoxy KM; the 
housing of the high-pressure tanks and some of the trunk lines 
are made of Kevlar-epoxy resin type organic fibers. 
  Thermal protection of OS is passive, and covers 
almost the entire surface of the craft. The most heat-stressed 
locations on the OS--the tips of the fuselage and the wing--are 
covered with reinforced carbon-carbon type KM, followed by 
plates of silicon dioxide with a boron-silicate coating with 
heat-resistant additives that are black in color protecting the 
lower surfaces of the fuselage and the wing, as well as its tips 
and trailing edge. White plates of silicon dioxide fibers with a 
boron-silicate coating are installed on the upper surfaces of 
the wing and fuselage, the tail fin and the SOM nacelles. The 
least heat-stressed locations--the OPN doors, upper surface of 
the wing and sides of the fuselage and SOM nacelles--are 
protected with mats of nylon fiber covered with an organic 
silicon resin. 
  Engine installations. The main engine installation 
consists of three SSME oxygen-hydrogen propulsion ZhRDs from the 
firm of Rocketdyne, with a thrust of 170 tones of force each on 
Earth or 213 tons in a vacuum. The engines have a self-contained 
configuration (both components enter the combustion chamber in 
gaseous form), with the reheating of spent turbogas in 
high-pressure combustion chambers, installed on the OS and fed 
from the VTB. The two solid-fuel launch boosters from the firm 
of Morton-Thiokol mounted along the sides of the VTB have a 
thrust of 1,203 tons of force at sea level. 
  The power plant of the OS consists of three batteries of 
hydrogen-oxygen fuel elements and three hydrazine auxiliary 
power plants used to steer the main ZhRDs, as well as to control 
the aerodynamic surfaces and the landing gear. 
  Status. The Space Shuttle MTKS had made 53 flights 
as of January 1993. Six OS were built--the Enterprise (employed 
as an analogue of the OS for horizontal flight testing), the 
Columbia, the Challenger (lost in the catastrophe of January 
1986), the Atlantis, the Discovery and the Endeavour. The system 
continues to be in service. 
  Additional information. The existing configuration 
of the MTKS was chosen in 1974. The flight testing started in 
April of 1981. 
  The MTKS is currently employed for deliveries to space, 
supporting astronauts in orbit and returning especially valuable 
payloads to Earth, but the Department of Defense had decided by 
the end of 1992 to refrain from the use of the MTKS to put 
military payloads into orbit, and to use the non-reusable launch 
vehicles of the Titan family for this purpose. 
<H6>  Energiya/Buran </H6>
  Crew. Two to four cosmonaut/pilots and up to six 
flight specialists. 
  Composition. The Energiya/Buran MTKS includes the 
Energiya launch vehicle (four Zenit-1 launch boosters and a 
central second-stage unit), which is able to put various 
payloads and the Buran orbital vessel (OK) into orbit. The OK 
and the launch boosters are the reusable elements of the system. 
  Flight configuration. At the moment of launch the 
MTKS includes the four RD-0120 oxygen-hydrogen engines of the 
central unit and the four RD-170 oxygen-kerosene engines of the 
boosters. Launch is vertical. The boosters separate from the 
central unit after finishing their operation, make a parachute 
descent in the atmosphere and land. The central unit ceases 
operation before reaching the nominal orbit, separates from the 
OK and is destroyed on entering the dense layers of the 
atmosphere. The OK is brought up to orbit using two 
oxygen-kerosene ZhRDs of the SOM system. The MTKS is controlled 
during this ascent stage by steering the combustion chambers of 
the ZhRDs in the central unit and the boosters on their bearing 
suspensions. Low-thrust oxygen- kerosene ZhRDs mounted in the 
nose and two in the rear RSU units control the OK in orbit. 
After the completion of orbital operations, the SOM engine 
issues a braking impulse, and the OK enters the atmosphere, 
makes an aerodynamic controlled descent, glides and make a 
horizontal landing with non-operating engines. The RSUs are used 
when leaving orbit and in the upper layers of the atmosphere, 
with the aerodynamic control surfaces coming into action to the 
extent of the descent of the OK. The OK can be controlled on the 
glide and landing legs either by the crew or automatically. 
  Design of the OK. The Buran is in principle 
analogous to the OS of the Space Shuttle by and large, but its 
wing is shifted forward somewhat. The tail section of the 
fuselage, aside from the rudder and flap under the fuselage, has 
the SOM engine installation, RSU units and a pod with the 
braking parachute. 
  Thermal protection of the OK is passive and 
plated. The tips of the fuselage and wing are covered with a 
carbon-carbon type reinforced KM, with the less heat-stressed 
places having plates of sintered quartz fiber with a protective 
coating. The thermal protection of the Buran OK, as opposed to 
the American craft, is "all-weather"--it can withstand rain and 
hail. 
  Engine installations. The principal ZhRDs of the 
launch vehicle and the ship are executed in a self-contained 
configuration (hydrogen comes into the combustion chamber in 
gaseous form, and the oxygen in liquid form) with the reheating 
of spent turbogas in the combustion chambers under high 
pressure. The RD-170 engines have a thrust of 740 tonnes of 
force each, the RD-0120s 156 tonnes each (205 in a vacuum) and 
the SOM ZhRDs 8,500 tonnes in a vacuum. 
  The power plant of the Buran OK is analogous to that of the 
Space Shuttle OS. 
  Status. The Energiya launch vehicle has made two 
flights--15 May 1987 with a Skif-DM (Polyus) module as the 
payload, and 15 November 1988 with the Buran OK without 
cosmonauts. The OK No. 1 had been mothballed by the start of 
1993, with the OK No. 2 prepared for orbital flight; the 
manufacture of OK No. 3 has been curtailed. 
  Additional information. The decree on the 
development of the Energiya/Buran MTKS came out in February 1976 
after the cancellation of the N1-L3 program. The manufacture of 
five Buran OKs had been proposed. The MTKS was to meet the 
country's needs for the placement into orbit of medium and heavy 
payloads for civilian and military purposes, with the return of 
some of them to Earth. 
  A special version of the VM-T bomber, which provided for the 
separate transport of the launch vehicle and the OK on an 
external hanger over the aircraft fuselage, was created in order 
to transport the larger elements of the system from the 
manufacturing plant to the engineering positions. The An-225 
Mriya heavy-lift transport aircraft was later created for these 
same purposes. 
  Smaller models of the OK (the BOR-4 and BOR-5) launched 
using 
the Kosmos launch vehicle were used to try out the aerodynamics 
and thermal protection of the craft in the range of high 
hypersonic speeds. 
  Flight testing of the Energiya/Buran has been halted, owing 
to the cutbacks in appropriations and the loss of interest in 
the program on the part of the Ministry of Defense. A 
non-piloted flight of Buran OK No. 2 is being proposed for 1993, 
with the subsequent mothballing of all of the MTKSs until such 
time as spheres for its efficient utilization are found.

<F P=106> [Article by Military Pilot 1st Class Colonel A. Denishchev </F>
under the rubric "For High Combat Readiness": "A Restructuring 
in the Combat Ranks..."] 
  [Text] ... was conducted by the aviators of the 
detached helicopter regiment commanded by Military Pilot 1st 
Class Colonel A. Denishchev, which encountered a host of 
difficulties when withdrawing from the ZGV [Western Group of 
Forces] and arriving in the Motherland. How they were able to 
set up combat training in a new location thanks to this 
"restructuring" is related by the commander. 
  People say that one move is worth two fires. And not for 
nothing--our own experience convinced us of that. We had just 
sent off the first echelons with the technical mat&eacute;riel to 
Azerbaijan, to the new base location, when we were suddenly 
removed from there and assigned to a different base airfield. We 
rushed to re-address our "household," not very likely with such 
haste. It was good that we got back at least some of the freight. 
  We had barely been able to recover from this scenario when 
there came the next--we received, instead of our own (almost 
completely new) helicopters, some that had "served out their 
lifetimes" from army aviation units that were still on the 
territory of Germany. It then became clear that the service 
lives of many of these combat craft would be sufficient just for 
the ferry flight to the Motherland. The aviation specialists 
under the supervision of my deputy for IAS [aviation engineering 
service], Lieutenant-Colonel V. Petkevich, had to sweat their 
guts out, as they say, to prepare the equipment for rebasing in 
a timely and quality manner. 
  But the main test awaited us on the ground, it turned out, 
and not in the air. And it started with the fact that there was 
not even anywhere to put the helicopters at the airfield where 
the regiment went. All of the suitable sites were occupied with 
aircraft from the local air club. There was nothing else to 
do--we had to take axes and shovels to set up new hardstands. We 
handled that task well enough. 
  We are still toiling with housing for the personnel. While 
the bachelors could still be put into barracks somehow, setting 
up the families was a very complicated matter--we couldn't even 
find any suitable rooms. We had to rent living space within a 
radius of 30 kilometers from the airfield. I, as commander, 
could not count on the rapid assembly of the personnel. 
  The energetic participation of the local administration and 
its head, V. Rudnitskiy, in solving our problems is easing 
everyday tensions. A team of construction workers repaired the 
office accommodations at the airfield under his direction, the 
head of one of the city's industrial enterprises has leased us a 
dormitory and the Zodchiy cooperative has built a barracks and 
teaching wing. The erection of the air compound is proceeding at 
a very slow rate nonetheless. Somebody, after all, is to blame 
that the construction started eight months late. Exactly who? 
Perhaps they know in Moscow? 
  But housing is housing, and the regiment must be 
combat-ready. No one has taken that task from us. The fliers, 
then, having completed their "earthmoving operations," have 
finally sat down at their desks and set about studying a flight 
region new to them without delay, and successfully passed the 
corresponding performance evaluations. I would like to note the 
efficiency with which the regimental senior navigator, 
Lieutenant-Colonel V. Zatinshchikov, developed, coordinated and 
obtained approval at the MVO [Moscow Military District] Air 
Forces headquarters for flight performance instructions--a 
document without which there could be no discussion whatsoever 
of flight training. 
  It must be admitted that the rhythm of flight training was 
disrupted at first owing to the constant interruptions in the 
supply of fuel and spare parts. We had to plan reduced flight 
shifts, but fortunately the proficiency levels of most of the 
pilots did not force us to accelerate their further training. 
The lag in the fulfillment of the norms for flying time at night 
in bad weather conditions was of concern, it is true, since a 
number of restrictions were imposed on the flights of our 
aviation after the unification of Germany. The flight commanders 
made up a detailed schedule for the restoration of lost skills 
by types of flight training, and set an annual threshold for 
each crew. This lag was able to be eliminated, to the credit of 
the entire collective. The work was organized best of all in the 
squadron of Lieutenant-Colonel N. Pyrin, who had many years of 
service in the DVO [Far East Military District] and is a "double 
Afghan." Most of his subordinates also completed the harsh 
schooling of Afghanistan. 
  I can assert with all confidence that virtually all of the 
crews are ready to perform the most complex combat missions 
today. Confirmation of this are the results of performance 
evaluations of combat readiness of the regiment by 
representatives of the Air Forces staff of the district. The 
personnel demonstrated good theoretical knowledge and high 
professional proficiency during them. The group of aviators 
headed by Major L. Kokoulin in particular, making use of the 
results of aerial reconnaissance, determined the optimal 
composition and most effective means of operation for the 
helicopter fliers to execute a fire strike from the air. The 
pilots in the flight of Major M. Pukhov handled the task of 
identification and target designation in excellent fashion; they 
clarified and transmitted in timely fashion the coordinates of 
"enemy" targets to the leaders of the 
groups--Lieutenant-Colonels A. Zittser and S. Kostikov. Their 
subordinates operated in masterly fashion, destroying ground 
targets on the first pass. The officers of the flight 
supervision group, who controlled them reliably on all sorties, 
also deserve no small amount of credit for the successful 
fulfillment of the assignments by the crews. 
  The results of the performance evaluations were doubly 
pleasing since we had to take part in them with a reduced 
complement. About a third of the officers and warrant officers, 
after all, signed requests for discharge from the armed forces 
or transfer to other service locations after the return to the 
Motherland. The departure of the younger ones, who were only 
yesterday filled with the hope of professional growth, is 
especially regrettable. The highly rated specialists and 
pilots/weapons officers Senior Lieutenants D. Pyshchev and V. 
Sychev have thus parted with aviation. And young officers such 
as them were worth 15 people. There is no need to relate the 
feelings that arose in parting with them. 
  Aviators who have decided to link their fate with service in 
the Russian Air Forces have meanwhile been coming to our 
regiment from the former republics since the collapse of the 
USSR and the start of the migration of servicemen. Senior 
Lieutenants S. Klichko and S. Abdurakhmanov, who came from 
Uzbekistan, were comparatively recently assigned to the post of 
flight technicians. A good spot is not long empty, as they say. 
  It is important that the newcomers be helped to gain 
confidence in themselves and regain their former optimism. The 
work of my deputy for personnel work, Lieutenant-Colonel V. 
Malashkin, should be singled out in this regard. Our collective 
is gaining army strength and cohesion again largely thanks to 
him. That is pleasing. I can thus state firmly that the regiment 
has successfully carried out the essential "restructuring in the 
combat ranks."

Vostrikov under the rubric "Flight Safety: Special Case": 
"Pickup"] 
  [Text] An Su-17MD fighter/bomber taxied out to the runway. 
Major A. Koval, military pilot 1st class, was to make a flight 
in the aerobatic area. 
  Takeoff, climb and arrival at the zone. Out of a steep 
climb, 
the pilot went into a wingover and created an angle of attack 
when pulling out of the descent that was close to the maximum 
allowable so as to come out with the minimal loss of altitude. 
He felt increasing G-forces, however, at an altitude of 2,800 
meters at a speed of 800 km/hr and an angle of dive of 30 
with a virtually immobile control stick. He looked at his 
instruments--the indicator for the angles of attack was off the 
scale. 
  He needed only a few seconds to assess the situation and 
make 
the correct decision. Through the vigorous pushing of the stick 
away from himself, he brought the aircraft out of the area of 
supercritical angles of attack and thereby averted entry into a 
stall mode. He reported what had happened to the flight 
operations supervisor, and on command curtailed his fulfillment 
of the assignment and returned to the airfield. 
  The aircraft had still not landed and specialists had 
already 
begun to discuss the possible causes for what had happened. Some 
suggested that the aircraft could have gotten into wake 
turbulence. Others felt that a G-force pickup had occurred, 
which was possible in this flight mode with vigorous piloting 
and the pulling of the stick toward oneself at a rapid rate. 
Reference was made to instructions. The opinion was expressed 
that an unsanctioned triggering of an SAU [automatic control 
system] actuator had occurred. The final answer, however, should 
have been provided by the "black box"--the on-board recording 
device (BUR). 
  The section of the flight where the precondition to a flight 
accident arose (Fig. 1, AB) was carefully analyzed in the 
decoding of the entries. The aircraft, at an altitude of 5,100 
meters at a speed of 590 km/hr, went into the wingover (Fig. 1, 
1-1) with the creation of a roll angle of 180 and the 
pulling back of the stick. The aircraft, in an upside-down 
position, began to curve in trajectory energetically through the 
large angles of attack. In a near-vertical dive (Fig. 1, B) the 
angle of attack increased to the maximum allowable value in 
operation (Fig. 1, C) owing to the movement of the stick for 
pitch. It later increased to a critical value (Fig. 1, K) with a 
virtually immobile stick. The aircraft was in the area of 
supercritical angles of attack for about three seconds, and only 
thanks to the pilot's vigorous pushing of the stick from 15 
to 8 did he get out of it. 




    That is the general picture of the dynamic of the aircraft's 
behavior on the section of the flight under consideration, but 
the causes were still not clear. The specialists carefully 
checked out all the variations. Analogous situations were 
considered to confirm the first variation-- getting into wake 
turbulence. The typical traits of that are arbitrary changes in 
the normal G-forces, and chaotic changes in G-forces and speed 
within small limits of about their average values, conditioned 
by the effects of disturbances from the wake turbulence. A 
comparison of the recordings (Figs. 1 and 2) made it possible to 
be convinced that the overshoot of the angle of attack was not 
caused by wake turbulence. 




    As for the second version--a manifestation of G-force 
pickup--the data from the recording gear testified that there 
had been no vigorous movements of the stick for pitch before the 
arbitrary increases in the values of the angle of attack. This 
version was thus also invalid. 
  The third version--violations of the functioning of an SAU 
actuator, which could have deflected the stabilizer into a 
non-standard position and created angles of attack greater than 
those allowable--was rejected after the decoding of the entries 
for the movement of the stick for pitch X[.sup]p[/] and the 
angle of deflection of the stabilizer [.sup]st[/], as well 
as a comparison of their values with standard ones (Figs. 3, 1 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-21A>           Fig. 1. </FIG>


<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-21B>           Fig. 2. </FIG>

and 2). Analysis showed that the control system was functioning 
normally, and the stabilizer had not been deflected by the SAU 
actuator mechanism. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-22A>             Fig. 3. </FIG>



  Continuing the research, and in particular analyzing the 
materials of flight testing, specialists established that such a 
phenomenon had taken place, but at angles of attack greater than 
allowable ones. They were within the permissible angles on this 
aircraft, but close to the maximums. What was the essence of 
this feature? 
  It can be observed only at Mach values less than the unit 
value, and is characteristic of aircraft with a swept wing at 
large angles of attack, when the linear dependence between the 
coefficients of the longitudinal moment M[.sup]z[/] and the 
lift force Cy is disrupted (Fig. 4). These phenomena, as flight 
practices show, are manifested most often at Mach values of 
0.7--0.9. The aircraft was at Mach 0.76 in this instance. An 
involuntary pull-up is an outward manifestation of instability 
in G forces n[.sup]y[/]. The cause of this is an 
impermissibly strong displacement forward of the center of 
pressure as a consequence of the development of a tip stall in 
the flow on the wing, as well as interference between the 
fuselage, wing and empennage. A tip stall on a swept wing causes 
a redistribution of loads across its span, which leads to an 
increase in the lift factor of the blade-root cross- sections 
and a decrease at the wingtips. The pressure center of the wing 
and the aerodynamic focus are thus displaced forward. The latter 
causes changes in the coefficient M[.sup]z[/][.sup]Cy[/] 
and the appearance of neutrality and instability in the 
aircraft. A number of design refinements have been made to 
eliminate them, making it possible to delay the development of 
tip stall in the flow. These include the installation of special 
fences on the wing, the geometric and aerodynamic twisting of 
the wing, the use of leading-edge flaps, deflectable tips etc. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UAC-003C-22B>             Fig. 4. </FIG>



  These measures made it possible to obtain satisfactory 
characteristics for longitudinal stability and controllability 
up to the maximum angles of attack in operation. This case, 
however, which has received the name of "stall pickup" in the 
technical literature, has called into question the completeness 
of the research that was conducted in the past, and has brought 
about the necessity of additional work to evaluate the behavior 
of the aircraft at maximum angles of attack. 
  Local G-force instability is an undesirable phenomenon in 
the 
operational realm of flight modes. It creates preconditions for 
unintentional losses of speed, transition to supercritical 
angles of attack and the entry of the aircraft into intolerably 
large G-forces. Enhanced attention of the pilot and great 
precision in actions with the control surfaces in piloting are 
required in this case. It should be remembered that countering 
the arbitrary fluctuations of the aircraft using deflections of 
the ailerons or control surfaces when getting into a "pickup" 
mode and stall not only do not have any impact, but can also 
lead to a spin. It is thus essential, when reaching angles of 
attack greater than those allowable, to leave the ailerons in 
neutral position and not to permit any slip using the rudder. 
Only the vigorous pushing of the stick away from oneself can 
bring the aircraft out of the critical zone. These were indeed 
the actions that were recorded by the on-board recording gear in 
this instance. This confirmed the good training of the pilot and 
his profound knowledge of the practical aerodynamics of the 
aircraft.

Candidate of Military Sciences and Professor Colonel-General of 
Aviation V. Kovalenok under the rubric "Military Reform and 
Higher Educational Institutions": "Preserve and Augment 
Pedagogical-Science Potential"] 
  [Text] A practical-science conference with the 
participation of representatives of a number of directorates of 
the central apparatus of the Ministry of Defense and the higher 
educational institutions of all branches of the armed forces of 
the Russian Federation was held in October of 1992 at the Air 
Forces Engineering Academy imeni Professor N.Ye. Zhukovskiy. 
Dissatisfaction with the current situation in the system of 
higher military education was distinctly heard in the papers and 
presentations. The contribution of higher educational science to 
resolving defense tasks in particular is being hindered by the 
sharp reduction in appropriations for its development and the 
lack of a streamlined mechanism for mutual relations between 
state budgetary and economically accountable structures, as well 
as the principles of financial and economic activity in the army 
and navy under conditions of cutbacks in the size of the armed 
forces and the transition to a market economy. The chief of the 
Air Forces Engineering Academy, Candidate of Military Sciences 
and Professor Colonel-General of Aviation V. Kovalenok, shares 
his thoughts on this problem. 
  The results of the conference confirmed yet again that the 
military academies and leading higher educational institutions 
of the branches of the Armed Forces today should be considered 
centers supporting the unity of the educational and scientific 
processes in the training of specialists for the 21st century. 
Meanwhile, the rapid outflow of young and promising staffers and 
experienced instructors to commercial structures is taking 
place, and the aspiration of the trained cadres to serve only 
until they reach pension age is progressing, owing to their 
limited independence in creating and reforming the scientific- 
educational subunits, training and certifying pedagogical cadres 
and awarding them military ranks, as well as the lack of a 
flexible mechanism of material incentives for the labor of 
military scholars. 
  The leadership of the Air Forces is taking certain steps in 
order to eliminate these causes. For example, specialists at a 
number of scientific-research institutions, in conjunction with 
representatives of our academy, are currently formulating a 
conceptual model for a unified system of training for 
engineering and scientific-pedagogical cadres for the Air 
Forces. A leading place in that is relegated to the development 
of new educational programs and progressive training 
technologies. 
  The academy, from the standpoint of the new requirements, is 
also engaged in the training of aviation engineers in seventeen 
fields and nine specialties, as well as doctors and candidates 
of sciences in doctoral studies, campus or off-campus graduate 
study and through dissertations. A rise in the qualifications of 
attendees in academic courses of study has been organized. Such 
intensive training of military cadres in many fields poses 
strict demands for the level of pedagogical mastery and 
scientific maturity of the professor and instructor personnel. I 
can assert with full confidence that the scientific-pedagogical 
potential of the academy (there are 96 doctors and more than 500 
candidates of sciences today) by and large meets the behest of 
the times. And that is no accident, since we devote constant 
attention to augmenting it. The capacity of campus graduate 
studies alone is 235 places today. Some 199 doctors and 2,512 
candidates of sciences have been trained since the time the 
academy was created. More than 400 people are working on their 
dissertations today, including 36 at the doctoral level. The 
subject matter of scientific works is aimed first and foremost 
at raising the combat readiness and quality of aviation 
engineering support for the combat operations of the Air Forces 
with a regard for trends in the development of the means of 
armed struggle, flight safety, reliability and combat 
survivability, reducing the detectability of aircraft and 
creating more effective weaponry, piloting, navigational and 
sighting systems and means of aerial reconnaissance and 
electronic warfare, including those founded on new principles 
and phenomena of physics. 
  I would like to emphasize that improving the systems for 
training pedagogues and scholars at our academy is not an end in 
itself. The work in this area, after all, is oriented toward the 
end result--the high professionalism of the graduates and the 
pursuit of basic scientific research. The amount of that, by the 
way, has increased by one-and-a-half times compared to 1989. 
  The solution of the problem of preserving and supplementing 
the scientific potential of the academy, at the same time, 
entails certain difficulties--as it does, by the way, at other 
higher educational institutions as well. This pertains first and 
foremost to the realization of the Statute on the Completion of 
Active Military Service, especially by highly skilled scholars. 
Statistics show that a pedagogue reaches the pinnacle of 
academic maturity at 45--50 years of age. And that is just the 
age when he is subject to discharge into the reserves. I cite as 
an example the fact that 25 (!) doctors of sciences who had 
served out the stipulated term left the walls of the academy in 
1987 and 1988 alone. We must urgently seek out reserves and make 
up for the losses. We have been left standing this time. If the 
cutbacks in the army continue to proceed by treating everyone 
alike in the future as well, however, there soon will not be a 
single doctor of sciences left at the higher educational 
institutions. I think there is no need to say where that could 
lead. 
  A maximum age for military service of 60 years for doctors 
of 
sciences and 55 for candidates must be established in this 
regard, in the opinion of participants in the conference, once 
and for all getting rid of the willful approach to the procedure 
for discharging them, allowing the academic councils of the 
higher educational institutions to determine independently the 
term of service of each leading scholar individually and 
shifting the positions of the professor and instructor personnel 
from the category of military to civilian and vice versa. 
  Much could be resolved at the local level using internal 
resources. A program to replenish and further increase the 
scientific potential of the academy, which envisages the 
training of 5--10 doctors and 80--100 candidates of sciences 
every year, has been developed here and is now being realized. 
We are getting support for this undertaking from the leadership 
of the Air Forces. The commander-in-chief, with his sights set 
on the long term, has approved the range of dissertation topics 
through 1995, and approved a plan to equip the academy with 
models of new-generation aviation hardware and armaments and the 
unique equipment without which the process of training 
engineering personnel is inconceivable. 
  Experience testifies that the replenishment of the 
scientific- pedagogical potential of the higher educational 
institutions takes place principally through the training of 
graduate students within their own walls. Taking this 
circumstance into account, and so as not to scatter manpower and 
resources, it would be worth concentrating this work, in my 
opinion, only at the military academies and leading higher 
educational institutions of the branches of the armed forces 
that have well- developed experimental bases and scientific 
schools as compared to other educational establishments of the 
Ministry of Defense, as well as expanding the rights of chiefs 
at the higher educational institutions to select worthy 
candidates in the ranks to be admitted to graduate study and to 
determine the times for the start of their study. 
  The necessity of a comprehensive approach to strengthening 
the intellectual potential of the Air Forces furthermore 
suggests the expediency of instituting the standard positions of 
professor, docent and apprentice instructor at the higher 
educational institutions for servicemen, and academic 
secretaries of the specialized and academic councils at the 
academies. 
  I think it would not be revealing any great secret if I were 
to mention the fact that the supervisory personnel of all the 
higher educational institutions without exception of the 
Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation will have to 
search for additional sources of material and technical support 
for the teaching process, under the conditions of sharp cutbacks 
in appropriations for the development of science, and in 
particular military science. Matters are still proceeding, 
frankly speaking, with some difficulty owing to a lack of 
experience. The necessity is thus arising of creating an 
economically accountable scientific-research center at every 
higher educational institution, the chief direction of the 
activity of which would be to choose the sale of the "scientific 
and technical products" of the higher educational institution 
and to obtain additional--I emphasize, extrabudgetary--funds for 
the further development of the educational and scientific bases, 
the resolution of problems of social protections for the 
personnel etc. Such a center should undoubtedly function within 
the context of stipulated legislation, under the monitoring of 
the command, the financial bodies of the educational institution 
and representatives of the scientific community. 
  There is another problem of no small importance that was 
vividly revealed during the years of "restructuring" in the 
former USSR, and has remained topical for the armed forces of 
Russia today as well. I have in mind the drop in prestige of the 
military education of the youth. I am profoundly convinced that 
the necessity of certifying a number of the higher educational 
institutions of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian 
Federation, and first and foremost the military academies, has 
become acute within the process of reforming higher schooling. I 
feel that such a step would make it possible for them to become 
competitive not only within the state, but at the international 
level as well, and would ensure an appreciable influx to them of 
both Russians and foreign servicemen. 
  The proposals that I have expressed must naturally be 
considered through the prism of the educational process of each 
higher educational institution separately. I hope that they will 
find reflection in the policy of military reform, and will help 
us to preserve and augment the scientific-pedagogical potential 
of the armed forces of the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Letters by Major V. Pupkov and Major S. Timofeyev under the </F>
rubric "Military Reform: Problems of IAS": "Where to Get 
Technicians?-- (Two Letters on One Topic)"] 
  [Text] 
<H6>  Break the Stereotypes </H6>
  Much is being said and written today on the lack of social 
and professional protections for aviators of all categories, but 
I think that the officers of the IAS [aviation engineering 
service] with secondary education are in the most difficult 
position. Judge for yourself: a lieutenant who is a graduate of 
a VATU [military aviation technical school] comes to a line unit 
in the post of aircraft technician, servicing group technician 
(standard procedures) or a specialist of a technical crew. And 
that is effectively his service ceiling. The higher positions, 
after all, are engineering ones. 
  It happens in real life that an officer technician who has 
not received higher education (very often owing to circumstances 
beyond his control) is named the chief of a flight or detachment 
TECh [technical maintenance unit], a servicing group or 
technical team, or even the chief of a group for standard 
servicing operations for the TECh of a regiment. But this is, 
after all, a breach of standard positional discipline. The 
positions correspond to the ranks of senior lieutenant or 
captain. 
  I knew quite a few good aviation specialists, conscientious 
and disciplined officer technicians, who served for 25 years or 
more at an airfield and were discharged into the reserves at 
those ranks. Many of them strove to keep learning at one time, 
but were not able to attain their dream owing to retraining on 
new aviation hardware, a shortage of people, combat duty 
etc.--they were not able to become engineers, although I repeat 
that many of them possessed profound knowledge and unparalleled 
organizational abilities. 
  Graduates of the higher aviation engineering schools, as a 
rule, are first assigned to technical positions. After two or 
three years of service they are transferred to engineering 
positions as chief of a flight or detachment TECh, a servicing 
group (standard operations) or a technical team. 
  And they serve an average of three to five years in this, 
their first supervisory position. They forget a great deal over 
this time, and the information they received at the higher 
educational institution becomes partially outdated. When some of 
them "grow up" to be a commander at the regimental level, they 
thus have to learn all over again. 
  I consider correct the decision to institute a term of study 
at the VVIA [Air Forces Engineering Academy] imeni N.Ye. 
Zhukovskiy in which an officer technician receives higher 
military education rather than higher special education (as 
before), i.e. primary training for engineers and 
training for supervisory engineering personnel are combined. 
This would give the graduate broad prospects in the service. 
  I am deeply convinced that the posts of chief of a flight or 
detachment TECh, chief of a servicing and standard operations 
group, assistant chiefs of IAS for an air squadron (in the 
training air regiments), deputy commander of an air squadron for 
IAS and positions close to them are not engineering positions in 
the full sense of the word in the new standard organizational 
structure of IAS. They could full well be held by officer 
technicians with the appropriate additional training. 
Engineering positions are the regimental engineers by fields, 
the chief of the TECh and the deputy commander of the regiment 
for IAS--that is, those that require the profound engineering 
analysis of the good working order and combat readiness of 
aviation hardware on the scale of a regiment, along with the 
ability to supervise large collectives. 
  I have become convinced through personal experience that 
competent officer technicians could successfully perform duties 
up to deputy commander of an air squadron for IAS (commander of 
ATO [airfield technical support]) inclusive. A powerful 
incentive in the service would then appear for them--the 
prospect of official advancement and promotion. Technical 
positions for such categories as engineers by fields and chief 
of regimental TECh could also be instituted in the training air 
regiments of flight schools equipped with training aircraft of 
relatively simple design. 
  I propose somewhat of a re-organization of IAS as a whole as 
follows (I think that these measures could be carried out in 
stages over several years). 
  First, the positions of aircraft technician, servicing and 
standard operations group technician and positions equal to them 
could be made senior warrant officer rather than officer 
positions. The air training regiments have such experience, 
where servicemen in these categories are successfully handling 
the duties of technicians and supporting a considerably greater 
yearly flying time for aircraft in high-quality fashion than in 
the line units. 
  The screening of candidates for the positions of technicians 
could be conducted among warrant officer mechanics, NCOs on 
extended duty and conscript servicemen, as well as among 
civilian youth. 
  Their training should be conducted at warrant officer 
schools, according to a special curriculum and with a regard for 
the level of professional knowledge of the trainees. The cadets 
should study profoundly the design and operation of the type of 
airframe that they will be servicing in the units during these 
training sessions. The future technicians should acquire skills 
in organizational work with subordinates. 
  The level of sophistication of the warrant officer schools 
must be raised and brought closer to the level of the military 
aviation- technical schools. They should train specialists as 
warrant officer mechanics for a term of 1.5--2 months, and 
senior warrant officer technicians for 5--6 months. The military 
rank of senior warrant officer is conferred on the graduating 
technician with the successful passage of exams and the receipt 
of certification of completion of the school. He completes 
graded evaluations according to specialty for the engineers of 
the regiment, and begins independent work under the monitoring 
of officer technicians in the unit. 
  Second, the graduates of the VATU should be assigned to 
officer positions in the IAS, starting with chief of a flight or 
detachment TECh, chief of a servicing group or their equivalent. 
These positions should be defined as technical rather than 
engineering. Some changes in the program of training cadets at 
the VATUs need to be made for the high-quality training of such 
specialists. The profound study of the design and operation of 
specific types of aircraft, the acquisition of durable skills in 
decoding the materials of on-board recording gear, the 
practicing of algorithms for finding and eliminating flaws in 
aviation hardware, making use of experience in servicing it, and 
the training of future officers in organizational work with the 
military collectives of the IAS up to squadron inclusive should 
all be envisaged in them. 
  Third, a permanently operating system of training 
specialists 
for higher positions should be created in the Air Forces. The 
training of candidates in special courses at technical or 
engineering higher educational institutions or at the staffs of 
large units and formations would be expedient for IAS. The 
program of courses should be composed with a regard for the 
knowledge, skills and abilities that could be needed by the 
trainees in the corresponding categories when working with 
personnel and on aviation hardware. Classes on the design and 
operation of aviation hardware could be conducted by the 
instructors of higher educational institutions, and on the 
organization of IAS operations and increasing combat readiness 
and flight safety by the engineers of the larger units and 
formations. Such courses should be one-and-a-half to two months 
long, but saturated with information. 
  Fourth, each officer--regardless of his education--should 
have real prospects for service advancement. The main criterion 
for his assignment to a higher post should be his attitude 
toward the service and the fulfillment of his official duties. 
  Major V. Pupkov (Krasnodar VOLTU) 
<H6>  Trust the Warrant Officers </H6>
  It is no secret that the aviation engineering service of our 
Air Forces is experiencing difficulties. One of them is a 
chronic shortage of technicians. An attitude has taken shape 
toward this profession as a minor one for some reason. Who is to 
blame for that? 
  First of all, it seems, those who are obligated to train and 
cultivate the IAS specialists and provide professional and 
social protections for them. The attempts that have been made at 
short-term courses to train technicians at the military 
aviation-technical schools have unfortunately sunk into 
oblivion. There are no open opponents to the ideas of the 
authors. But it is a paradox--matters never move further than 
talk. I will try and confirm this with statistical data. I make 
no claim to absolute completeness of the data in my possession, 
but it testifies eloquently to the unenviable position of the 
IAS. 
  I was able to visit four aviation units where aircraft of 
various types are being operated. They are stationed under 
relatively favorable conditions. The people are more or less 
well provided for. The shortcomings that are able to be revealed 
would thus be average ones for all of the Air Forces, as it 
were. What was I able to find out? 
  The units are staffed with officer technicians and engineers 
in such a way that they are, at a minimum one, out of six 
specialists short. The question of where the graduates of the 
Air Forces technical schools are is a natural one. Some 354 
young specialists have come here over the last ten years. Sixty 
nine of them were "lost" virtually irretrievably to the IAS over 
that time--34 transferred to other service, and 35 were 
discharged into the reserves. One out of five VATU graduates, in 
short, lost touch with the IAS over the ten years. It turns out 
that each school trained two full classes for... the national 
economy and filling vacancies in support units. 
  There is another fact of no small importance as well. Forty 
one of those remaining advanced in the service, and 17 went for 
training at military higher educational institutions in their 
fields. Isn't that where the "floating" level of education of 
IAS officers comes from? 
  The problem of technical personnel staffing levels for the 
IAS cannot be solved by calling up reserve officers for two 
years of service after their completion of civilian higher 
educational institutions, since these people are by and large in 
the army temporarily. According to the data, only 53 of the 237 
people who came to the aviation units from civilian life over 
the last decade remain in the ranks of the Ministry of Defense. 
  The large understaffing of the IAS with technical personnel 
is thus obvious. Is there a way out of this situation? I think 
there is. This problem can moreover be resolved at the local 
level in most cases. The aviation units have able specialists 
(the discussion here concerns warrant officers) who want to 
perform the duties of technicians and senior technicians. Just 
give them the opportunity to study up in special courses, and 
they are ready technicians, chiefs of servicing groups and the 
TEChs of detachments and flights... 
  I am confident that a warrant officer who becomes an officer 
will serve until discharge into the reserves for age reasons or 
based on total time served. Why not make use of that? The sad 
statistics would change immediately, it seems, if we were to do 
that. In favor of the IAS.

"Military Reform: In the Air Forces of the Commonwealth 
Countries": "In Independent Flight"] 
  [Text] Ukraine was among the first nations of the 
Commonwealth to declare its right to resolve issues of military 
organizational development independently. The uncompromising 
stance of Kiev on the question of the formation of a national 
army did not suit everyone, but to give them their due, it made 
it possible to set about the practical realization of the 
conceptual framework for the creation of air forces in the 
republic in a very short time. 
  Many associate the successful emergence of this branch of 
the 
armed forces with the name of the commander--Lieutenant-General 
of Aviation Valeriy Vasilyev, whose service was linked with the 
former Odessa and Carpathian military districts for many a year. 
The commander himself had this to say: "My emergence as an 
aviator really did take place on Ukrainian soil. And every 
officer would agree with me that one cannot in good conscience 
fulfill one's military duty without being instilled with respect 
for the history and traditions of a people whose peaceful labors 
you are entrusted to protect. That is why the aspirations of the 
Ukrainians for sovereignty, for the genuine right to dispose of 
their own fate, including on questions of defense, are near and 
dear to me. I am proud of the fact that I have been entrusted 
with the command of the Air Forces of a nation, in whose annals 
are inscribed in golden letters the names of scientists, 
designers and pilots who were trailblazers of the skies and 
space: Nikolay Kibalchich and Yuriy Kondratyuk, Igor Sikorskiy 
and Aleksandr Mozhayskiy, Sergey Zhukovskiy and Sergey Korolev, 
Arkhip Lyulka and Oleg Antonov... I believe that this feeling of 
participation in the cause of all generations of countrymen is 
shared by all fliers who have sworn their loyalty to Ukraine, 
holding to its policy of independent development within the 
framework of conciliar statehood." 
  The economic crisis and other negative phenomena of our 
times 
have undoubtedly had an impact on military reform in Ukraine as 
well. A particularly difficult situation has taken shape in the 
Air Forces--the most technically sophisticated branch of the 
armed forces. 
  This is, first and foremost, the problems with logistical 
support for the combat training of fliers as expressed in 
shortages of fuel, spare parts and assemblies. It would be 
erroneous to explain, as some politicians are attempting to do, 
that all of these needs are from the very fact of the 
proclamation of its independence by Ukraine and difficulties in 
relations with the countries of the so-called near abroad. The 
author, who has visited many of the units, sees the reasons in 
the disruption of economic ties among enterprises and the 
overall decline in production. I can say, knowing the situation 
in other regions of the former Union, that things are no 
better--if not worse-- there as well. 
  What is the way out of this situation? We must obviously be 
realists. The leadership of the Air Forces of Ukraine have 
intentionally reduced the pace of flight training, taking into 
account not only the amounts of reserves of material resources, 
but also changes in the international situation and the 
lessening of military confrontation in Europe. They are 
striving, that is, to provide a level of combat readiness 
thereby that diplomats have defined as precisely the level of 
defensive sufficiency. The struggle to raise the efficiency of 
combat training has also been called upon to play its role in 
the cause of providing a climate of economy. 
  The level of proficiency of the Ukrainian aviators makes it 
possible to hope for a rapid transition of the national Air 
Forces to a new rhythm of combat training. They do not conceal 
the fact, however, that the personnel issue is quite acute. The 
taking of the military oath of loyalty to Ukraine, after all, 
forced every serviceman to make an unequivocal choice of 
citizenship right from the start. Whatever may be said, the very 
necessity of deciding was unexpected and was perceived quite 
painfully for many. And it is entirely natural that some fliers 
announced their desire to return to their native lands, to other 
republics of the CIS. Quite a few vacant positions appeared as a 
result, especially squadron commanders. That is why the careful 
screening of candidates for the open positions is underway 
everywhere in the regiments even today. The results will not be 
long in coming. We are thus talking about temporary 
difficulties, and in no way a hopeless situation. If we look to 
the more distant future, then with a certain reconfiguration of 
some of the aviation schools located on the territory of Ukraine 
they will be able, to all appearances, to train their own 
national cadres for all the branches of aviation. 
  I will say, anticipating the readers' question, that the 
personnel problems in the local areas are being considered, 
wherever possible, through the lens of ensuring social 
protections for the personnel. The officers believe that a 
series of pieces of legislation will soon make it possible to 
provide all families of servicemen with housing and all- round 
incentives for their martial labors. 
  Quite a bit of work really does lie ahead if we are talking 
about the strategic tasks of military reform. A conceptual model 
for the creation of a qualitatively new branch of the armed 
forces of Ukraine--the Air Defense Troops--is being considered 
in earnest in Ukraine; they will include the larger units and 
formations of PVO [Air Defense], the Air Forces and space units 
in an organizational regard. It is difficult to predict the 
results of such an experiment, and it has both many advocates 
and many opponents. The latter, judging by an appearance at the 
January session of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, could include 
General V. Vasilyev to a certain extent as well. Time will tell 
all. It will be necessary in any case to talk about a 
fundamental review of the tasks and aims of military reform of 
the Air Forces of Ukraine in accordance with its peaceloving 
foreign policy and the rationalization of the standard 
organizational structures of the armed forces. 
  Yes, Ukraine has proclaimed that it is a non-aligned nation, 
that it will not maintain, produce or employ nuclear weapons, 
and that it sees no neighboring country as a potential 
adversary. But this stance in no way propagates the euphoria of 
pacifism. The military in Ukraine have not forgotten their main 
task--to maintain proper combat readiness. They like to refer 
here to the experience of local wars, testifying to the decisive 
role of aviation in the attainment of victory in contemporary 
battle. 
  A separate question pertains to improving the structure of 
the Air Forces. The projected program envisages, in particular, 
gradual cutbacks in administrative structures through the 
disbanding of the divisional echelon. Calculations show that 
this measure, under the prevailing conditions in the republic, 
would make it possible to increase markedly the combat potential 
of the aviation forces. 
  A body for the centralized command and control of the Air 
Forces has already been created on the basis of the former 
headquarters of the air army in Vinnitsa, to which are 
subordinate the operational command-and- control groups in the 
Western (Lvov) and Southwestern (Odessa) sectors, as well as 
groups for the command-and-control of military-transport 
aviation, reserves and personnel training. 
  They are also not getting by in Ukraine without cutbacks in 
the size of the troops. The cutbacks in personnel will be 
insignificant in the first and second stages of the military 
reform, up to 1995. This will affect officers who have served 
out their stipulated terms first of all. The directive issued by 
the Supreme Soviet and the President of the republic on the 
discharge only of servicemen with the right to a pension and 
provided with housing, as a rule, is being unswervingly 
fulfilled. But there are plenty of aggrieved people, since it is 
it simply impossible to take all living situations into account. 
  More significant later cutbacks in the administrative 
structures, support subunits, storage bases and, partly, the 
aviation regiments, from 1995 through 1999, will once again be 
through dischargees who have served out their terms or some 
other circumstances. This process may also be carried out in a 
less painful manner for peoples' fates by regulating the 
entering classes at the military schools. 
  Meetings with the army community last year revealed yet 
another problem, of a morale nature, connected with the 
re-organization of the armed forces of Ukraine. The officers 
were concerned at the time about whether their honorary name 
designations would be retained after the reformation of the 
units, with a right to the legacy of combat history and 
traditions. This question has now been resolved, I was told at 
the socio-psychological service of one of the Kiev headquarters, 
and the honorary names of the storied units and formations will 
be retained under the new conditions as well. Someone sensibly 
reasoned that the memory of heroic deeds of older generations 
could be a powerful factor in the indoctrination of draft youth 
and the soldiers of today. 
  The problem of the state symbol on the aircraft of the Air 
Forces of Ukraine has also been cleared from the agenda. A 
statute on distinguishing marks (emblems) for aviation units is 
being considered in parallel with it. 
  Suitable variations of samples of these unique military 
crests will have to be selected on a competitive basis and 
discussed publicly in the military collectives. A colleague of 
mine, ARMIYA UKRAINY newspaper staff correspondent for the 
Vinnitsa garrison Nikifor Lisitsa, related this to me. 
  I would note that the distinguishing marks of the Ukrainian 
Air Forces appeared for the first time on the MiG-29 aircraft 
that took part in air shows in the United States and Canada in 
the summer of 1992. That visit, by the way, was described in 
detail in the last issue of AVIATSIYA I KOSMONAVTIKA, which 
immediately became a bibliographical collector's item among the 
local aviators, since not all of them subscribe to it. Most of 
them have now understood that the contemporary specialist cannot 
get by without a professional periodical. Both Vasilyev and his 
deputies, as was reported at the secretariat of the commander of 
the Air Forces of Ukraine, are permanent subscribers to the 
journal. It has become much more substantive and interesting in 
the last two years, in their opinion. Such a review obligates us 
to a great deal. Most importantly, it forces us to believe that 
the collaboration between the fliers of the CIS countries in the 
skies and on the groud will serve the cause of peace and the 
preservation of friendly relations between our peoples in the 
future as well.

  [Text] The idea of creating a European defense system first 
emerged in the late 1940's. The first step toward making it a 
reality was the formation of the Western Union in 1948, which 
included France, Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and 
Luxembourg. Later, after Italy and West Germany were accepted 
into this military-political organization, it was renamed the 
Western European Union [WEU].[.sup]1[/] However, the 
disagreements between France and Great Britain that had emerged 
already at that time, the main one being the growth of power of 
the NATO bloc created in 1949, for more than 30 years relegated 
the WEU to the background in resolving issues of the collective 
security of West European countries. 
  In the 1980's, they again turned to the idea of creating a 
so-called "Eurodefense" in Western Europe. The initiators of 
this were France and the FRG, playing a leading role in building 
a "unified Europe." A most important practical step toward 
creating a "European defense" system was the WEU council's 
adoption of a document in October 1987 at The Hague that was 
given the name "The Platform of Interests of European Security." 
It defined the goals, tasks, and basic directions of military 
organizational development in Europe. 
  In accordance with the document, a "Eurodefense" system was 
to be built taking into account the following basic principles: 
Keeping an American military presence in Western Europe, 
including a nuclear presence; maintaining the powerful armed 
forces of West European states at a level ensuring deterrence of 
any aggressor; improving the nuclear forces of France and Great 
Britain and maintaining them at an "impressive level." 
  The document placed special emphasis on the fact that the 
Western European Union is assigned the role of a "European 
mainstay" of NATO. Thus, the planned "European defense" system 
was to be created in close coordination with the North Atlantic 
alliance and help to strengthen its military positions. 
  The process of West European integration in the military 
area 
was stepped up noticeably in the early 1990's. This was largely 
helped by the signing of a treaty in Maastricht in late 1991 by 
leaders of countries of the European Community (previously the 
EEC or Common Market) on plans for creating the European Union, 
the component elements of which, as is expected, will be 
military-political and currency-economic alliances. 
  The main function of the new organization is to be to work 
out a unified foreign policy course of the states of Western 
Europe, including questions of defense and security. A leading 
role in carrying out these tasks is allotted to the WEU--the 
only purely European organization today possessing powers in the 
area of defense. 
  In recent years, as the integration process in Western 
Europe 
developed, the WEU's role grew noticeably, and the number of its 
members increased. Spain and Portugal joined in 1988, and Greece 
joined at the WEU council session held in Rome in October 1992. 
Turkey, Norway, and Iceland were accepted as associate members, 
and Denmark and Ireland as observers. Thus, the WEU today unites 
all European NATO countries and all member-states of the 
European Community. In the assessment of western experts, the 
necessary conditions are thereby created for the Western 
European Union to fulfill the role both of a "European mainstay" 
of NATO and the military nucleus of the future European Union. 
  The question of forming military structures within the WEU 
framework is now actively being studied. Thus, at the WEU 
council session in Bonn in July 1992, the decision was made to 
create its standing armed forces. Participants in the forum 
expressed a readiness to place at the disposal of the WEU troop 
contingents for accomplishing such missions as joint defense, 
supporting actions for humanitarian assistance, and settling 
crises, including measures to restore peace. It was proposed to 
man WEU forces through multinational formations, units, and 
subunits of the member-states' armed forces. In addition, it was 
decided that troop contingents from the NATO allied armed forces 
could be transferred to the command of the Western European 
Union to carry out special combat missions. 
  Today, France and the FRG play a leading role in formation 
of 
the WEU armed forces. Already in May 1992, the decision was made 
at the Franco-German summit to create by 1995, on the basis of a 
Franco-Germany brigade, a joint army corps of up to 40,000 
servicemen. Its basis is to be France's 1st Armored Division and 
Germany's 10th Tank Division. It is planned to deploy the 
headquarters of the "Eurocorps" already in October 1993 in the 
city of Strasbourg, France. It will number about 300 operational 
and technical staff. A number of WEU partners of Paris and Bonn, 
Belgium, Luxembourg, and Spain in particular, expressed the 
intention to assign their own troop contingents to this corps. 
Later on it is planned to create on its basis European "rapid 
deployment forces," which will have air and naval components in 
their composition. 
  Formation of military command and control bodies of the 
Western European Union has begun. A military planning group has 
been functioning since October 1992. It has been decided to 
conduct meetings of the chiefs of general staffs on a regular 
basis. It is also planned to form a transport air command. 
  In addition, it is planned to form within the WEU framework 
a 
so-called "West European arms group." In this regard, they are 
considering the question of including as part of the Western 
European Union the Independent European Programming Group 
[IEPG][.sup]2[/] by the end of 1993 and transferring its 
secretariat from Lisbon to Brussels, which, it is believed, will 
help create a unified arms market in Europe. Possibly, the NATO 
Eurogroup, which includes the ministers of defense of the bloc's 
European member-states, will also be integrated into the WEU in 
the near future, together with its sub-groups involved in 
matters of cooperation in the area of military 
telecommunications, logistic support, and long-term planning. 
  A space reconnaissance center of the Western European Union 
has begun operating at Torrejon Air Base, Spain. It is planned 
to be used to gather intelligence information and monitor 
fulfillment of disarmament treaties and observation of crisis 
areas in Europe. Today the center has only one-third the 
necessary equipment. About 50 specialists and analysts from 
various WEU countries are working here today. They are tasked 
with monitoring observance of the embargo declared against 
Serbia and Chernogoria. On the whole, in the opinion of WEU 
leadership, the beginning of the center's functioning is an 
important stage in resolving the issue of deployment of an 
autonomous European space reconnaissance system. 
  At the initiative of Paris, the question of creating nuclear 
forces of Europe based on French and British arms and developing 
a general nuclear strategy has been placed on the agenda. On the 
whole, this idea received approval of the WEU leadership, whose 
experts began a comprehensive study of the possibility of its 
implementation. Thus, in 1992, the WEU's Institute of Security 
Problems conducted research to draw up general recommendations 
on a European nuclear policy. Some of the results of this 
research was reflected in the work "European Integration and 
Nuclear Deterrence After the Cold War." In particular, it 
concludes it is necessary to safeguard the defense and security 
of WEU countries not possessing nuclear weapons by means of the 
"nuclear umbrella" of Great Britain and France and thus creating 
an "intra-European expanded system of nuclear deterrence." 
Experts proposed two variants of such a system. 
  One of them called for creating a classic system of nuclear 
deterrence based on three components: A nuclear strategy, a 
structure of European nuclear forces, and a system of command 
and control of them. Implementation of this variant assumes the 
development of a WEU nuclear strategy, creation of a unified 
body for consultations on employment of nuclear forces and a 
nuclear planning group, and deployment of French and British 
nuclear arms on the territory of certain nonnuclear WEU states. 
The second project differs from the first primarily by the fact 
that it does not call for stationing British and French nuclear 
forces on the territory of other WEU countries. 
  In the opinion of the French leadership, a European nuclear 
strategy could be prepared by 1995 based on the corresponding 
principles of the French military doctrine ("deterrence and 
intimidation"), taking into account changes in the 
military-political situation in Europe. At the same time, for 
the time being most West European countries have not officially 
expressed their attitude toward the idea advanced by Paris of 
creating nuclear forces of Europe. The British leadership, 
without completely rejecting it, so far is responding to it 
quite reservedly and regards its own potential, first of all, as 
national and not part of the European potential. 
  A trend of an all-round drawing together of the Western 
European Union with NATO is developing. To improve coordination 
of actions between the two organizations, the WEU headquarters 
has been transferred from London to Brussels. A bilateral 
agreement has been signed providing for an exchange of 
information and conduct of meetings of the governing bodies. The 
first joint session of the NATO and WEU councils was held in May 
1992. The decision made by Paris and Bonn on the possibility of 
transferring the Franco-German corps to the NATO command to 
accomplish missions for repelling aggression, should it be 
undertaken with respect to countries of the alliance, or to 
carry out peacekeeping actions (as a result, the corps was given 
the status of dual operational subordination) largely served 
this drawing together. 
  This subordination of forces and assets of the Western 
European Union is becoming a characteristic trait of the 
interaction of the two military-political organizations. Thus, 
at the joint session of NATO and WEU councils held by the 
permanent representatives in Brussels on 8 June 1993, the 
decision was made to transfer to a single command the naval 
groupings of NATO and the WEU operating in the area of the 
Yugoslav conflict. Operational command and control of the joint 
grouping while conducting operations in support of the embargo 
in the Adriatic Sea has been entrusted to the commander of the 
NATO allied naval forces in the Southern European Theater of 
Military Operations. 
  The question of dual subordination was also reflected in the 
May 1993 session of the Western European Union council in Rome, 
where they discussed problems associated with assigning special 
operations forces to the WEU to settle crises. The importance of 
this problem involved the need to increase the role of the WEU 
in preventing and settling conflict situations both in and 
outside of Europe. It has been proposed to include as part of 
the special operations forces a multinational airmobile division 
of NATO's "rapid deployment forces," created from troop 
contingents of Great Britain, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and 
also a Anglo-Dutch marine brigade. In doing so, the participants 
of the meeting emphasized that the airmobile division and the 
marine brigade, like the "Eurocorps," should be given dual 
subordination status--NATO and WEU. It is quite obvious that the 
goal of all the measures is to give the Western European Union 
at this stage functions of a "bridge" between NATO and the 
European Community. At the same time, advocates of creating 
independent European military structures and pursuit of an 
independent course by Europe in the area of security and defense 
believe that the WEU's status as a connecting link between NATO 
and the European Community will be a temporary phenomenon. In 
the future, they allot it the role of the military nucleus of 
the planned European Union. In doing so, in their opinion, the 
new European military-political organization will have complete 
operational freedom, which will enable it to act, if necessary, 
independently of NATO. 
  However, such an approach to creating a "Eurodefense" evokes 
an unequivocal reaction in NATO. The U.S. administration and the 
leadership of the North Atlantic Alliance express a negative 
attitude toward plans of creating independent European 
structures. They see this as an aspiration to decrease 
substantially the influence of the United States in Europe and 
its role in NATO, which in the end can lead, in the American 
leadership's assessment, to the disintegration of the alliance. 
Today, work continues on the optimal model of the future 
"European defense" system that takes into account the real 
military-political conditions and eliminates the ambiguity that 
today characterizes the relations between NATO and the WEU. 
  Thus, the process of creating a "European defense" system at 
the current stage is beginning to enter the stage of practical 
decisions, which indicates the serious intention of the 
leadership of West European countries to achieve greater 
independence from the United States in forming and pursuing a 
military-political course. It is becoming obvious that the bases 
of the "Eurodefense" system will be formed primarily around the 
WEU, which is gradually turning into the base military-political 
structure for uniting Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by Col A. Tsvetkov, doctor of military sciences, </F>
and Lt-Col V. Tsarkov, candidate of historical sciences] 
  [Text] The early 1990's were marked by significant changes 
in the development of the world community. The Cold War became a 
thing of the past; a mighty world power--the Soviet Union--broke 
up; the size of the armed forces in a number of countries of 
America, Europe, and Asia is being reduced; and relations 
between states once belonging to different social systems are 
improving. 
  The U.S. administration that came into office in January 
1993 
also stated its view of international relations in the situation 
that has been created. Developing new tenets of a national 
security strategy, it not only continues to assign an important 
role to the "intelligence community"[.sup]1[/] in ensuring a 
favorable balance of forces for the country and stability on a 
global and regional scale but is also stepping up the activities 
of its bodies. 
  In all stages of its existence, American intelligence has 
serviced primarily the interests of the U.S. military-industrial 
complex. This has been demonstrated in its global nature, the 
sharp anti-Soviet orientation, and the allotment of intelligence 
functions to all the main agencies participating in the pursuit 
of foreign policy. 
  The basis of the current U.S. intelligence system was set 
forth in the National Security Act of 1947 and in National 
Security Council (NSC) Directive 20/1 of 1 August 1948, which 
officially proclaimed the U.S. path toward overthrowing the 
socialist system in the USSR. Specific goals in the war against 
the Soviet Union were defined more specifically in NSC Directive 
20/4, approved by President H. Truman on 23 November 1948. 
  These documents officially recognize intelligence activities 
against socialist countries as state policy and an integral 
element of Washington's overall policy course. It also defined 
the system of intelligence agencies. The Intelligence 
Consultative Council (ICC) was created under the NSC, which 
included representatives of all agencies involved in 
intelligence and subversive activities. The Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA), created in 1947 based on the Office of Strategic 
Services (OSS) disbanded immediately after World War II, began 
to play the dominant role among all special services. The 
organizational structure of the CIA was basically defined by 
1955. In place of the Office of Policy Coordination and the 
Office of Special Operations that existed before, often 
duplicating one another, the Office of Planning was formed, or 
as it is often called, the office of covert operations. During 
this time, the offices of intelligence information, scientific 
intelligence, and administration appeared. 
  Appropriate adjustments were made to the intelligence 
organization of the armed forces. A permanent joint intelligence 
committee began to coordinate the activities of the various 
types of intelligences. It was made up of the deputy director of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff for intelligence, the assistant chief 
of staff for intelligence of the Army, and the chiefs of 
intelligence of the Navy and Air Force. A joint intelligence 
group with two offices--planning and current intelligence 
operations--became the committee's working group. Intelligence 
in the Army was accomplished by the G-2, in the Navy by the ONI, 
and in the Air Force by the A-2. 
  At the same time, the National Security Agency (NSA), the 
Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the State Department, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which is part of the U.S. 
Department of Justice, the Intelligence Office of the Federal 
Atomic Energy Commission, the Intelligence Service of the 
Department of Treasury, and a number of other organizations and 
institutions were drawn into the orbit of intelligence 
activities. 
  The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and also the 
Intelligence Service of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) were created in the early 1960's. In 
addition, steps were taken to create space intelligence, and 
special forces were formed. 
  The 1970's were a qualitatively new stage in the development 
of the U.S. intelligence services--creation of a system of 
global espionage and stepping up of intelligence and subversive 
activities and terrorist actions abroad, particularly after the 
appearance of U.S. Presidential Directive PD-59 in the summer of 
1980. During this time, the U.S. intelligence bodies were 
strengthened and reorganized in order to increase the 
effectiveness of intelligence organizations, create a system of 
competing intelligence bodies and a centralized file system, and 
expand covert operations abroad. "We," then-President R. Reagan 
stated, "must do everything we can for the United States to have 
the best intelligence." 
  The National Security Council, headed by the President, 
remained the highest body overseeing intelligence. Its main 
working bodies were the Special Coordination Committee, headed 
by the President's assistant for national security, and the 
Committee for Policy Assessment, headed by the director of the 
CIA. In addition, during this time, striving to further 
intensify intelligence and terrorist activities against 
socialist and liberated countries, U.S. President R. Reagan, at 
the suggestion of the CIA director, brought back the 
Consultative Council on Overseas Intelligence Activities that 
was disbanded by J. Carter in March 1977. 
  The nucleus of the U.S. "intelligence community" during the 
Reagan Administration remained the Central Intelligence Agency, 
directly subordinate to the National Security Council. The CIA's 
main tasks were defined in its updated regulations in the 
following manner: Managing political, economic, and military 
intelligence on a global scale; accomplishing covert operations 
abroad (primarily in socialist countries); analysis and 
assessment of intelligence information and reporting it to the 
government; and coordination of the activities of U.S. 
intelligence services. 
  Whereas no fundamental changes took place in the overall 
structure of the CIA (the central staff, branches within the 
country, and foreign bodies) when the Reagan Administration took 
office, there was a clearly defined trend in the top leadership 
toward reinforcing it with experienced professional intelligence 
agents. Thus, W. Casey, who was in charge of Reagan's election 
campaign, was appointed director. During World War II he held 
the position of chief of the European Office of the Office of 
Strategic Services. An experienced intelligence agent, D. Bross, 
was appointed as his special assistant, and B. Inman, former 
director of the National Security Agency who enjoyed the trust 
and favor of the President, was appointed deputy director. As 
the American weekly NEWSWEEK wrote at that time, "Casey is able 
to strengthen covert agent intelligence; Inman is able to 
organize the administrative apparatus of the CIA and maintain 
cordial relations with Congress." 
  During this same time, the intelligence bodies of the U.S. 
Department of Defense were reorganized significantly: The DIA, 
NSA, and Aerospace Intelligence Agency. Special Operations 
Forces (SOF)[.sup]2[/], intended for operations in "hot 
spots" of the globe, occupied a special place in this system. 
  The DIA--one of the principal intelligence organizations 
"competing" with the CIA--began to be given the main role in the 
Pentagon's intelligence. As then Pentagon chief C. Weinberger 
said, its main tasks were to firmly oversee the intelligence 
services of the branches of the armed forces and the military 
attache staffs, improve the quality of intelligence assessments, 
and step up the pace of scientific research and development in 
the interests of improving intelligence forces and assets." 
  In the DIA, the information service and subunits of 
scientific and technical intelligence were strengthened, as was 
the office supervising the work of military attaches (the 
agency's numerical strength increased to 6,000). 
  Considerable attention was devoted to the NSA in the U.S. 
global intelligence system. This, in the assessment of the 
western press, the "all-penetrating electronic monster" is 
intended to organize and manage communications and electronic 
intelligence on a strategic scale, decipher codes of foreign 
states, coordinate the activities of other intelligence bodies 
in this area, develop codes for governmental, diplomatic, and 
military communications, ensure secrecy of information being 
transmitted over these channels, and also oversee the security 
services of the armed services (beginning in 1971 through the 
Central Security Service--CSS) and other agencies. 
  "Break-ins into foreign embassies in the United States and 
abroad, organized from time to time to steal codes and cipher 
machines, and also intensification of electronic surveillance 
within the country," as the magazine PROGRESSIVE noted, are a 
new function of the NSA. 
  The procedure for collecting, processing, and distributing 
information obtained by NSA forces and assets, as well the 
coordination of its activities with similar systems of the CIA 
and FBI were improved considerably during these years. In 
particular, in 1976 the United States began using the gigantic 
Ilike-IV computer (located in an armored bunker of Building N 
233 of NASA at Moffett Field, California) to process 
intelligence information. It is a system of 64 computers able to 
perform from 100 to 200 million operations per second and store 
8.4 million bits in the data bank and another 1 billion bits in 
the magnetic memory. At the same time, the NSA has stepped up 
research considerably in the area of cryptography and creating 
cipher machines, cooperating closely with the Defense Analysis 
Institute (DAI). 
  The State Department's intelligence service has a special 
office instead of a Bureau of Intelligence and Research. The 
structure of this service has basically remained the same (six 
regional and several functional offices), but its subunits 
engaged in analyzing the condition of the economy, science, and 
social processes in the USSR and other countries have been 
expanded considerably. The staff of the special office is manned 
basically with career intelligence agents known for their 
aversions for the Soviet Union and other socialist and 
developing countries. 
  A step forward was made in stepping up the intelligence 
activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Besides 
accomplishing functions of political criminal investigation and 
counterintelligence in the country, the bureau has stepped up 
intelligence collection abroad. By that time, as the WASHINGTON 
POST newspaper wrote, the FBI "had its own agents in most 
capitals of the world and in many cities of various countries." 
The Drug Enforcement Administration, which engaged in 
identifying on U.S. territory and abroad organizations producing 
and supplying drugs and, at the same time, assessing the 
economic capabilities of certain countries, was operationally 
subordinate to the FBI. 
  The new economic upheavals by the early 1980's enlivened the 
activities of the Secret Service of the U.S. Treasury Department 
(Intelligence Support Office), which began to concentrate its 
efforts not only on studying the financial situation in leading 
capitalist states but also on obtaining data on the credit and 
financial system of socialist countries and its capabilities for 
financing defense measures. 
  The intelligence service of the Department of Energy has 
also 
defined its role in the U.S. intelligence community. It has 
begun in earnest to engage in the collection and analysis of 
information on the nuclear industry, scientific discoveries, and 
research developments in the area of nuclear physics and on the 
availability and amount of fissionable materials in the leading 
powers of the world. It also is engaged in the development of 
aerospace reconnaissance systems for detecting nuclear tests and 
in the assessment of the capabilities of foreign states in the 
areas of creating nuclear weapons. 
  Former CIA Director R. Helms named the following as among 
the 
CIA's urgent problems in the 1990's: Monitoring the 
proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons; 
intensifying the collection of information in key regions of the 
world, including using the latest satellites; strengthening 
cooperation with the intelligence services of NATO countries; 
conducting intelligence collection against Russia and its 
economic, nuclear, and military potentials; increasing interest 
in the Middle East and China; increasing the role of covert 
agent intelligence in obtaining information. 
  In unison with the statement by R. Helms, the American 
newspaper the BOSTON GLOBE noted that the CIA has intensified 
"spy activities against Russia" together with other intelligence 
services of East European and also Baltic states, having 
received consent for such cooperation from the White House in 
July 1992. 
  Former President G. Bush spoke even more openly concerning 
this when he addressed CIA employees in January 1993. In 
particular, he emphasized that today the White House requires 
more, not less, intelligence information. Bush, who once headed 
the CIA, substantiated this position by the "preservation of 
real threats to U.S. national security." The new U.S. President 
B. Clinton is adhering to the administration's previous policy 
with respect to intelligence--"preserve a strong and active 
system of obtaining and analyzing intelligence information." 
  Based on the military-political tasks facing the United 
States today, the Clinton Administration has decided to "expand 
the role and capabilities of all types of intelligence 
collection." To this end, a number of steps are being taken to 
improve intelligence management bodies, and forces and assets of 
covert agent, space, electronic, air, maritime, and also ground 
forces intelligence. 
  James Woolsey, who is no novice in intelligence, was 
appointed director of the CIA in January 1993. Between 1977 and 
1979 he was deputy secretary of the Navy and had a career in 
naval intelligence and counterintelligence. In the staff of the 
CIA, in addition to the four main directorates 
retained--operations, information, science and technology, and 
administrative--a directorate for planning and coordination 
began functioning. Its main purpose is to assume some of the 
functions of the main operations directorate (planning covert 
operations abroad and accomplish cooperation with intelligence 
services of other countries.) 
  The functions of the intelligence and research office of the 
State Department were modified somewhat in connection with the 
breakup of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union 
and with formation of the new states. The office began to be 
more involved in overseeing the intelligence activities of 
embassies, particularly in countries of Eastern Europe, the 
Baltics, Transcaucasia, and Central Asia. It has improved the 
quality of processing obtained intelligence information with the 
aid of the latest computers, and increased the number of 
employees of the office involved in conducting negotiations on 
disarmament problems outside the United States. 
  The Federal Bureau of Investigation not only has preserved 
its positions under the new administration but has also 
strengthened them, particularly in the area of 
counterintelligence abroad, after authorization for citizens to 
travel freely abroad in Russia and other states of the former 
USSR. 
  The structure and tasks of the Directorate of Intelligence 
Support of the Treasury Department and the Directorate of 
Intelligence of the Energy Department remained basically 
unchanged. 
  As far as the Drug Enforcement Administration is concerned, 
it recently has strengthened its overseas and coordination of 
activities with the intelligence services of foreign states, 
including Russia. 
  The DIA has strengthened its positions under the Clinton 
Administration. Besides a certain updating of missions and 
changes in the structure of the staff of the DIA director 
(reorganization of the special group of advisers in the area of 
intelligence information analysis), there has been a 
strengthening of subunits of covert agent intelligence of the 
Main Directorate of Operations, Planning, and Personnel Training 
and also of the Directorate of Foreign Ties of DIA. The 
contingent of students at the College of Military Strategic 
Intelligence has been expanded through the attendance of citizen 
of East European countries. 
  The NSA has reexamined somewhat its activities in connection 
with recent changes in the world. It has considerably 
intensified subunits of communications and electronic 
intelligence for monitoring the situation in countries of the 
former USSR, in the Middle East, and in the Far East. 
  In addition to the existing National Office of Air and Space 
Reconnaissance (NOASR, as part of the Department of the Air 
Force), engaged in operating equipment and directly conducting 
reconnaissance, the Central Office of Imaging Intelligence was 
created in the Department of Defense in May 1992. Its tasks 
include planning and coordinating programs using satellites and 
strategic reconnaissance aviation. 
  Significant changes have taken place in the work of staffs 
of 
intelligence bodies of the departments of the Army, Air Force, 
and Navy, primarily along the line of reorienting them in new 
directions in accordance with changes in the geostrategic 
situation in the world. 
  Work is continuing on increasing the effectiveness of covert 
agent intelligence. Typical in this respect is the statement of 
one of the former directors of the CIA, W. Casey, who stated in 
an interview with the magazine PROGRESSIVE that "covert agent 
intelligence is continuously being developed thanks to constant 
support of the government and the Senate." 
  Covert agent intelligence collection is conducted by CIA 
resident agents overseas (more than 100 of them), military 
attaches of the Defense Department, the diplomatic corps, an 
other departments, using for this specially trained intelligence 
agents sent out on the territory of foreign states under legal 
cover (diplomats, journalists, scientific workers, businessmen, 
tourists, and so forth) and also recruited citizens from one or 
another country. 
  The Clinton Administration is devoting special attention to 
stepping up secrecy in the activities of covert agent 
intelligence collection and increasing the scale of covert 
operations abroad. As the foreign press notes, the new CIA 
director's personal experience in supervising Navy intelligence 
"strengthened in him the opinion about the need to implant 
reliable agents and covert operations specialists in key areas 
of the world." 
  After summarizing the experience of using Special Operations 
Forces in the armed conflict in the Persian Gulf[.sup]3[/], 
measures are being conducted to improve their organizational 
structure, armament, equipment, and methods of combat employment. 
  A typical feature of further improving U.S. electronic 
intelligence collection is the creation of integrated (fixed and 
mobile) automated communications, electronic, radar, and 
electro-optical intelligence collection systems, which is done 
comprehensively using ground, maritime, air, and space assets. 
The NSA alone has at its disposal more than 2,000 intercept and 
direction-finding sites located both on the continental United 
States and abroad. They are in any American embassy and also at 
such sites as Istanbul (Turkey), Darmstadt and Berlin (Germany), 
Brindisi (Italy), the island of Crete, and in Morocco and 
Norway. According to data from the London magazine THE NEW 
STATESMEN, the NSA site at Menwith-Hill (Great Britain) uses the 
services of the British Post and Telegraph Agency to hook up to 
nearly all electronic communications channels in Western Europe. 
  As before, especially after the military conflict in the 
Persian Gulf, the United States highly values space intelligence 
collection for its global nature and ability to monitor huge 
territories and water areas of the globe in short periods of 
time, expose various installations, precisely determine their 
coordinates, and rapidly transmit obtained data to echelons 
concerned, down to and including the tactical level. The United 
States uses imaging and electronic intelligence systems for 
conducting reconnaissance collection from space, as well as a 
ballistic missile early warning launch detection system. 
  The imaging space intelligence collection system is based on 
integrated use of Lasp and Samos satellites, each of which can 
conduct reconnaissance in an area up to 100 km wide up to eight 
times while flying over the territory of Russia during daylight 
hours. The satellites of this system are equipped with 
photographic, television, and infrared intelligence collection 
equipment. 
  The basis of the space electronic intelligence collection 
system is the Big Bird and Key Hole satellites, which make it 
possible to conduct continuous surveillance of the most varied 
enemy electronic assets and determine their location and basic 
characteristics. 
  The space-based ballistic missile early warning launch 
detection system is being improved. It includes four or five 
satellites, two information receiving and processing centers, 
six mobile receiving complexes, and one transportable receiving 
station. This system uses infrared telescopes, proton detectors, 
and radiation reconnaissance instruments installed on satellites 
to register the flare of the sustainer stage missile rocket 
engines as well as nuclear detonations. The United States began 
developing the new "Orius" in 1991 to replace "Iments" equipment. 
  In addition to the above systems, great hopes are being 
placed on the Columbia manned spacecraft commissioned under the 
Space Shuttle program back in 1983. Manned space ships are 
equipped with weapons and reconnaissance equipment. 
  In recent years, American specialists have continued work in 
the direction of expanding the capabilities of the integrated 
aerial reconnaissance system, primarily by improving the U-2R, 
SR-71A, and RC-135 aircraft, decreasing their radar contrast, 
equipping them with more powerful engines, creating strategic 
unmanned reconnaissance aircraft, and also improving onboard 
reconnaissance equipment of tactical reconnaissance aircraft 
(cameras, lasers, side-looking radar, and infrared devices). It 
is planned to gradually replace the F-16R and RF-4C 
reconnaissance aircraft. To this end, the new Lightning-2 
reconnaissance aircraft is being developed based on the F-22A 
fighter. As a result, U.S. spy agencies will receive the 
capability to obtain data on the enemy in detail and in short 
periods of time in continental and ocean theaters of military 
operations on a real or near real-time basis. 
  Recently, aerial reconnaissance infrared devices, above all 
those operating in the long-wave portion of the IR spectrum, 
have improved considerably. They make it possible to fairly 
reliably disclose camouflaged enemy objects, above all his 
missiles, aircraft, and tanks, according to the temperature 
difference of their surface or engine exhaust gases and the 
temperature of the background. 
  The United States assigns a special role in its spy plans to 
E-3A Sentry reconnaissance aircraft of the AWACS long-range 
radar detection and control aircraft equipped with radar and 
electronic intelligence collection equipment. These aircraft, 
belonging to the 552nd Air Wing of the United States Air Force, 
make regular flights over Europe and the Middle East. They are 
able to detect airborne targets at ranges up to 400 km, vector 
weapons to them, and also detect ground targets. Judging from 
reports appearing in the press, the Pentagon is considering 
further expanding airborne spying activities against Cuba, 
Yugoslavia, Iraq, and the DPRK. 
  A new stage in improving U.S. maritime reconnaissance forces 
and assets became the completion of creation of a global system 
for detecting enemy nuclear-powered missile submarines. Its 
basis is the SOSUS long-range sound surveillance system (a 
network of hydrophones located in the Atlantic, Pacific, and 
Arctic oceans and connected to 22 shore-based receiving posts) 
and also nuclear-powered submarines and surface ships equipped 
with sonar equipment. Some of the SOSUS sensors are installed on 
the seabed, and other at various depths in the water. The 
information gathered from them along with data from other 
maritime reconnaissance forces and assets flow together to a 
central information collection point over a network of UHF 
channels and via satellite. 
  The main role in such a system, according to the journal 
PROGRESSIVE, is to vector weapons to a Russian missile submarine 
and suddenly put it out of commission. "This aspiration," the 
journal concludes, "is in keeping with the preemptive strike 
concept dominant in Pentagon strategists' thinking up to now." 
  Thus, this brief review of the structure and activities of 
the U.S. "intelligence community" makes it possible to conclude 
that today and in the foreseeable future it will be assigned a 
significant role in implementing foreign policy and safeguarding 
U.S. interests in various regions of the world.

  [Text] The current military-political policy of the 
Republic of Poland is being formed in conditions of a radically 
changing situation in Central and Eastern Europe, associated 
primarily with the dissolution of the Warsaw Treaty Organization 
and the reorientation of the former allies of the socialist 
community on the West. In addition, the military policy is being 
influenced significantly by the social, political and economic 
reforms being carried out in the country, the weakening of ties 
with the republics of the former USSR, and the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from its territory. The Polish government's 
activities are directed at accelerating the process of 
integration into the European military-political and economic 
structures, and also at establishing bilateral, mutually 
beneficial cooperation with the leading countries of the West. 
In doing so, one of the main goals was for Poland to join NATO 
as a full or associate member. 
  The Polish government considers the inviolability of the 
state borders, the lack of territorial claims on neighboring 
countries, the refusal to recognize any state as an enemy, and 
non-use of force in resolving international disputes to be the 
basic principles set forth as the basis of the military doctrine 
adopted in late 1992. It is also believed that the national 
armed forces must possess sufficient might, in the event of 
wide-scale aggression, to restrain the enemy's advance deep into 
the territory and, by inflicting maximum losses on him, gain 
time to settle disputes by political means. In the opinion of 
Polish command authorities, it is impossible to ensure 
guaranteed protection of national interests by its own forces 
alone, which is how it justifies the desire to integrate into 
NATO structures. 
  The new military doctrine is based on tenets of the national 
security concept (given the name "perimeter defense"), calling 
for an even disposition of troops in the state's border areas 
and a readiness to repel armed aggression from any direction. To 
implement the doctrine, it is planned to create on the basis of 
the Polish Army small, well-equipped and well-trained armed 
forces capable of ensuring reliable protection of the national 
interests. 
  According to the constitution, the country's president is 
the 
supreme commander in chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic 
of Poland. The Defense Committee is the consultative body under 
the president during peacetime. It can be made up of members of 
the government, the chief of the General Staff, and 
representatives of the houses of parliament. 
  The minister of national defense (a civilian) exercises 
overall direction of the armed forces and shaping of military 
policy. The chief of the General Staff is responsible for the 
daily activities of the Polish Army, support, and combat 
training. 
  The strategic level of command and control of the armed 
forces is made up of the central bodies of the Ministry of 
National Defense and the General Staff; the operational level is 
the headquarters of the armed services; and the 
operational-tactical level is the headquarters of the four 
military districts (Maritime, Silesian, Warsaw, and Cracow, 
formed based on the southern part of the Warsaw Military 
District. During wartime they are to be reorganized into 
headquarters of four mechanized corps), an air corps and air 
defense corps, warship and coastal defense flotillas, and Naval 
Aviation command (Figure 1). 


<FIG ID=JPRS-UFM-001L-8A>           Figure 1. Organizational Structure of </FIG>



  According to data from foreign military sources, the overall 
numerical strength of Poland's armed forces exceeds 296,000. It 
includes the Ground Forces, Air Force and Air Defense Forces, 
Navy, and during wartime the Border Guards and formations of the 
Civilian Militia (subordinate to the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs), numbering about 20,000 and 18,000, respectively, and 
also the Regional Defense Forces being newly formed. 
  The force composition of the Ground Forces (more 
than 194,000) has 11 mechanized divisions with varied manning 
levels, 13 brigades (three missile, three artillery, one 
assault, one coastal defense, one mountain infantry, and four 
engineer), and also logistic and technical support facilities. 
  The military districts have the following force composition: 
Maritime District--three mechanized divisions, one coastal 
defense brigade, one missile brigade, one artillery brigade, and 
one engineer brigade; Silesian District--four mechanized 
divisions, two missile brigades, two artillery brigades, two 
engineer brigades, one mountain infantry brigade, and two 
antitank artillery regiments; Warsaw District--two mechanized 
divisions, one artillery brigade, one engineer brigade, and 
logistic and technical support facilities; Cracow District--two 
mechanized divisions (in the stage of formation), one assault 
brigade, and one mountain infantry regiment. 
  The Ground Forces' have more than 2800 battle tanks (T-72, 
T-55), 2846 infantry vehicles [BMP's] and armored personnel 
carriers [BTR's], 1500 field artillery pieces (Gvozdika, Dana, 
Figure 2 [not reproduced]), 550 M-120 mortars, 260 multiple 
rocket launchers (BM-21, RM-70), 65 Skud and Tochka missile 
launchers, more than 400 antitank guided missile launchers 
(Fagot, Malyutka, and others), and 700 antitank artillery 
pieces. In field air defenses there are up to 260 surface-to-air 
missile [SAM] launchers and more than 900 antiaircraft artillery 
pieces. The mechanized divisions in the Ground Forces have a 
typical structure. At peacetime strength each division has 
4,500-5,500 people, and at wartime strength more than 11,000. A 
division includes three mechanized regiments, one artillery 
regiment, one antiaircraft artillery regiment, one antitank 
artillery battalion, and logistic subunits. There are 186 tanks, 
205 BMP's and BTR's, and 126 field artillery pieces, mortars, 
and multiple rocket launchers. 
  The Air Force and Air Defense Forces (83,000 
people) have four combat aviation regiments, two military 
transport regiments, three helicopter regiments (all combined 
into an air corps), and also eight air defense regiments in 
three air defense corps. 
  Armament includes: 508 combat aircraft (245 MiG-21's, 104 
Su-22's, 37 MiG-23's, Figure 3 [not reproduced], 30 MiG-17's, 28 
Su-20's, 12 MiG-29's, and others) and also 30 Mi-24 combat 
helicopters and 154 auxiliary helicopters (130 Mi-2's, 21 
Mi-8's, and 3 Mi-17's). The Air Defense Forces also have more 
than 250 SAM launchers. 
  The force composition of the Navy (19,000 people) 
includes a flotilla of attack ships and two coastal defense 
flotillas, a fighter aviation regiment, and a special naval 
aviation regiment. 
  Armament includes: Three submarines, one destroyer, one 
frigate, four corvettes (Figure 4 [not reproduced]), eight 
guided-missile boats, eight patrol boats, 24 minesweepers, and 
so forth. Naval aviation has 38 MiG-21 fighters, 15 Mi-14 
antisubmarine warfare helicopters, and others. 
  In accordance with the military organizational development 
program, it is planned to reduce armed forces personnel strength 
to 230,000-250,000 people and complete by the mid-1990's a 
reorganization of formations (large units) and central command 
and control bodies, converting them to a new structure in 
accordance with the model adopted in NATO countries. The 
percentage of career servicemen is to be 50-60 percent. It is 
planned to reduce the number of weapons and military equipment 
to the levels established by the Conventional Armed Forces in 
Europe [CFE] Treaty. By the end of the 1990's, it is planned to 
have no more than 1730 battle tanks, 2150 BMP's and BTR's, 1610 
field artillery pieces, mortars, and multiple rocket launchers, 
460 combat aircraft, and 130 attack helicopters left in the 
inventory of the Polish Army. 
  It is envisioned that the Ground Forces will have 10 
mechanized divisions, three infantry brigades, two assault 
brigades, two mountain infantry brigades, and one coastal 
defense brigade. Of all the large units, only three mechanized 
divisions and two assault brigades will be manned at less than 
65 percent of wartime strength. 
  In connection with the forthcoming reduction of the armed 
forces, it is planned to create "rapid deployment forces" 
consisting of one to two assault brigades and two regiments of 
combat and transport helicopters to repel any sudden aggression 
or to participate in settling local armed conflicts. If 
necessary, these forces are to be reassigned from the Ground 
Forces and the Air Force to the disposition of the chief of the 
General Staff. The possibility of using them as a part of UN 
peacekeeping military contingents is not ruled out. It is also 
planned to form regional defense forces to reinforce Poland's 
defense system on axes not protected by regular forces and to 
guard important installations. They will be armed basically with 
light small arms. Peacetime cadre-strength regional defense 
brigades and regiments will be deployed up to wartime strength 
during mobilization. 
  Manpower acquisition for the armed forces is 
accomplished based on the Law on National Defense passed in an 
updated form in September 1991. The draft age is 19 years. A 
single term of service of 18 months has been established for all 
servicemen. A call-up is conducted twice a year. 
  Personnel of the Polish Army are represented by 
compulsory-service and cadre servicemen. In early 1993, more 
than 80,000 cadre servicemen were serving in the armed forces; 
however, there is a large manpower shortage (officer positions 
are manned at an 85 percent level, and noncommissioned officer 
positions at a 67 percent level). In the opinion of command 
authorities, the problem of maintaining the Army's combat 
effectiveness with a considerable reduction in its numerical 
personnel strength can be resolved by recruiting servicemen on a 
contract basis. However, the process of professionalization of 
the Army (to a level of 50-60 percent) will extend to the end of 
the 1990's. These servicemen will fill positions associated with 
operating weapons and military equipment. 
  Western experts estimate that Poland's trained reserve of 
the 
armed forces exceeds 435,000 people, including 352,000 for the 
Ground Forces, more than 65,000 for the Air Force and Air 
Defense Forces, and about 18,000 for the Navy. 
  Thus, the planned reorganization of the armed forces and 
their rearming with the latest models of weapons and military 
equipment of both western and domestic production pursues the 
goal of creating a small, well-armed and well-trained Army. It 
is believed that replacing obsolete Soviet-made weapons and 
military equipment with models compatible with those in service 
in western countries will considerably help speed up Poland's 
integration into the military-political structures of NATO.

  [Text] An article published earlier in our 
journal[.sup]1[/] examined the state and prospects of 
development of China's Air Force, the composition of which 
includes national air defense units and subunits. Below we use 
foreign press data to shed light on questions concerning the 
organization, force composition, training, and employment of air 
defense forces and assets. 
  The basis of the national air defense system is Air Force 
forces and assets and also air defense formations of the Ground 
Forces, Navy, and the so-called "people's air defense," 
performing civil defense functions. In the opinion of 
representatives of the PRC Ministry of Defense, creation of a 
unified air defense concept for the long-term future should be 
determined by its increased role as a component of the "national 
deterrence forces," which will require deployment of warning 
forces (primarily space- and air-based) as part of air defense 
and centralization of command and control of air defense forces 
and assets of the armed forces and "people's air defense" based 
on creation of integrated command bodies. 
  All of China's territory is divided into seven large 
military 
districts in which air defense forces and assets are stationed. 
The commander of the district air forces is responsible for 
organizing air defense within each district, and his deputy is 
charged with direct supervision. 
  Command and control of forces and assets is accomplished 
from 
the main air defense command post (Beijing) and also from the 
air defense command posts of the military districts, aviation 
formations and large units, and units of surface-to-air missile 
[SAM] troops and antiaircraft artillery. 
  Fighter aviation is an active air defense asset 
and numbers up to 4,000 aircraft: 400 J-5 (Xian-5 in national 
terminology), 3,000 J-6 (Xian-6), 500 J-7 (Xian-7), and about 
100 J-8 (Xian-8) aircraft. Of these, the J-5, J-6, and J-7 are 
obsolete fighters made based on the Soviet MiG-17, MiG-19, and 
MiG-21 aircraft, respectively. 
  The main efforts in the development of fighter aviation are 
concentrated on optimizing its quantitative composition and 
speeding up modernization of the aircraft fleet. Chinese 
military experts believe that the structure of the Air Force 
should develop in the direction of a more proportional 
representation of such branches of aviation as fighter-bomber, 
reconnaissance, and auxiliary aviation, which in conditions of 
reducing the armed forces can be accomplished with a consistent 
decrease in fighter aviation's percentage. 
  It is planned to decrease the number of fighters by quickly 
removing from service obsolete equipment and gradually refitting 
with new types of aircraft. The J-7 and J-8 aircraft (Figure 1 
[not reproduced]) will remain the country's main air defense 
fighters until the year 2000. Their service will be extended by 
upgrading them (the latest modifications are the J-7-3 and 
J-8-2). 
  The J-7-3 air defense fighter, unlike the J-7 base model, is 
equipped with a more powerful WK-13 engine with 6,500 kgf of 
thrust in the afterburner mode. It is equipped with additional 
fuel tanks, a JL-7 radar, and a radar warning system. It has a 
23-mm under-fuselage cannon, two additional weapon hardpoints, 
and improved fire control instruments. 
  The J-8-2 aircraft has been made since the mid-1980's and is 
a multipurpose fighter ensuring the intercept of air targets at 
high altitudes and destruction of ground targets. It is equipped 
with a nose fairing and auxiliary inlets, two WK-13A turbojet 
engines with 6,700 kgf of thrust each on afterburner, and seven 
hardpoints for missiles and other weapons. It is planned to 
upgrade the aircraft with participation of American firms, which 
are to equip 55 aircraft with modern electronics. 
  Specifications and performance characteristics of China's 
modern fighters are shown below.

  A shortage of financial resources in the country does not 
make it possible to conduct an accelerated aircraft 
modernization; therefore, re-equipping the Air Force with J-7-3 
and J-8-2 fighters is being accomplished at a slow pace. In 
addition, the Chinese leadership possibly does not want to 
continue series production of fighter aircraft lagging 1-2 
generations behind those of western countries, especially since 
they have begun purchasing modern aircraft abroad (in 
particular, Russian Su-27 fighters). 
  Surface-to-Air Missile Forces and Antiaircraft 
Artillery. About 100 battalions of Hunqi-2 medium-range 
SAM's (600 launchers) with a maximum height of 28 km are 
deployed on China's territory. 
  Development of the surface-to-air missile forces and 
antiaircraft artillery is proceeding along the path of refitting 
and re-equipping them with new types of SAM's and antiaircraft 
artillery and improving the tactics of their employment and 
training facilities. In connection with this, the decision has 
been made to accelerate the pace of developing the 
surface-to-air missile forces and antiaircraft artillery, 
especially in connection with the planned reduction of fighter 
aviation and the need to redistribute missions between fighter 
aviation and ground air defense components. 
  Since the first half of the 1980's, China has been actively 
developing several new types of SAM's. The basis of their 
creation is the requirement to increase mobility, the number of 
channels, and protection against jamming, and also to reduce the 
time of the firing cycle. As a result, a number of experimental 
models of SAM systems of various types have been created. 
Individual ones have been put into service. 
  The basis of China's surface-to-air missile defense is the 
HQ-2 (Hunqi-2) medium-range SAM, developed on the base of the 
Soviet-made SA-75 SAM. It has been produced since the 
mid-1960's. Foreign experts estimate that the air defense force 
composition today includes as many as 600 launchers for the 
modernized HQ-2A/2J (Hunqi-2A/2J) SAM. In the late 1980's, the 
mobile HQ-2B (Hunqi-2B) SAM system was created on its base. It 
has a modernized missile which uses a new type of radar 
proximity fuze (the point of initiation of the warhead 
detonation is adjusted depending on the missile's position 
relative to the target). It uses an improved warhead that 
creates a large number of flechettes upon detonation and has a 
rocket motor with increased thrust. The acquisition and control 
radar is equipped with an optical and television target-tracking 
system. The KS-1 mobile medium-range SAM system is currently 
going through field testing. 
  Definite progress was achieved in developing a short-range 
SAM system. Thus, by the early 1990's China had introduced 
models of four new systems: HQ-61 (Hunqi-61), FM-80, PL-9, and 
HN-5C. It is planned to use them to reinforce protection of 
individual small installations and to build up air defenses of 
major administrative-political and military-industrial centers 
and also in the interests of battlefield air defenses. Active 
formation of battlefield air defense and assigning it from the 
composition of field artillery to an independent arm of the 
Ground Forces will be accomplished in the next decade. 
  Development of the HQ-61 SAM system was conduced in China 
from the early 1980's, and today has been completed. The system 
includes a launcher with two single-stage solid-propellant 
SAM's, a Type 571 target acquisition radar (similar to the 
Soviet P-15), a missile guidance radar, a control element, and 
supporting ground equipment. 
  The FM-80 SAM system is based on the French Crotale system. 
Today, the Chinese press has reported the formation of the first 
battalion equipped with this type of SAM system. The system may 
be produced both in the mobile and fixed version. 
  The PL-9 SAM launcher is mounted on an armored personnel 
carrier base and resembles the American Chaparral system in 
appearance (Figure 2 [not reproduced]). It uses a SAM similar to 
PL-9 air-to-air missile made based on the American AIM-9L 
Sidewinder. 
  Development of the HN-5C SAM system began in the early 
1980's. It was first presented in 1986. In the original variant, 
the launcher was mounted on a light truck chassis. During the 
course of subsequent modification it is planned to put the 
launcher on the base of a wheeled armored personnel carrier. The 
SAM system includes eight missiles in canisters and eight 
reserve missiles. The system is service by two people. It uses 
the missile from the HN-5A portable SAM system with an infrared 
homing head. It is planned to upgrade it and equip it with a new 
homing head to support firing at air targets from the forward 
hemisphere. 
  The specifications and performance characteristics of 
Chinese-made SAM systems are shown in Table 1.

  Antiaircraft artillery from SAM and artillery brigades and 
separate antiaircraft artillery regiments is used to combat the 
air enemy at low altitudes and in the immediate proximity of 
installations being covered. Its inventory includes more than 
16,000 100-, 85-, 57-, 37-, and 23-mm antiaircraft pieces. 
  Development of antiaircraft artillery is proceeding along 
the 
path of creating antiaircraft artillery and missile-artillery 
systems. An artillery system usually includes 35- and 37-mm 
guns, a command and control facility, and a Type 702 fire 
control radar, which can be used with the improved antiaircraft 
fire control instrument. In addition, a missile-artillery system 
includes a launcher with four PL-9 missiles. 
  Radar Monitoring of the Airspace. A military 
district is divided into sectors, each of which has 8-12 radar 
posts. A total of more than 550 radars, more than 60 percent of 
which perform air defense missions, and the rest perform air 
traffic control missions. Air defense radar posts are located 
mainly along the state border and seacoast, providing a 60-80 
percent overlap of the zones of responsibility of adjacent 
posts. The posts have the most modern radars, which create a 
solid radar field at altitudes of over 2,000 meters. In the 
opinion of western military experts, a solid radar field does 
not exist at altitudes below 2,000 meters. 
  Improvement of monitoring equipment in the near future is 
tied to the next generation of radars entering service, which 
possess better jamming protection and can be linked to automated 
control systems. Development of phased-array, over-the-horizon, 
and multi-position radars is regarded as the promising priority 
directions. In examining foreign experience in improving radar 
monitoring systems, Chinese specialists believe it is necessary 
to create a single radar field by combining the efforts of the 
different armed services and civilian agencies. This will make 
it possible to substantially reduce the number of Air Force 
radar posts and economize on forces and assets. 
  Today, the troops are beginning to receive new types of 
radars: 408C and HN-503 (first-line radar posts are equipped 
with them); multifunctional three-coordinate JY-8 (Figure 3 [not 
reproduced]), JY-14, 146-1A (they are part of command and 
control and warning centers); JY-8A and JY-9 low-altitude target 
acquisition radars; and REL air traffic control radars.

Chinese-made radars are shown in Table 2.

  Chinese experts consider automation of command and control 
processes to be an integral part of increasing air defense 
combat capabilities. It is being accomplished during the course 
of a dual process of shifting to new types and means of 
communications. The main one among them will be space-based 
communications and equipping command and control bodies and 
elements with computer equipment and combining them into 
automated complexes and systems. 
  An example of such a system is the TADS-2 (Tactical Air 
Defense System), on the basis of which an air defense sector or 
zone command post can be deployed. It includes five 
container-type cabins (two control cabins, each equipped with 
six to eight control panels, and three technical support and 
communications cabins) and also an electric power generating 
unit. The system makes it possible to distribute information on 
120 air targets with a discreteness of 10 seconds, 
simultaneously track up to eight targets in the automatic mode, 
and accomplish up to eight guidance vectorings. 
  The main directions of the military-technical policy in the 
area of improving air defense are being implemented 
simultaneously with working out the fundamentals of combat 
employment of air defense forces and assets. Chinese military 
experts believe that development of a basic form of using air 
defense forces and assets, which is what an air defense 
operation is, must take place within the framework of forming a 
system of views on combat employment of the armed forces. This 
will make it possible to coordinate efforts in developing 
weapons systems and military equipment and determining the 
overall need for them, state more precisely the composition of 
the force dispositions in a theater of military operations, and 
also optimize their defensive and offensive capabilities. At the 
same time, it is recognized that the existing level of the air 
defense system, the weak capabilities of automating the command 
and control processes, and the incomplete development of 
theories of operational art of the armed forces make the task of 
organizing and conducting an air defense operation in existing 
conditions difficult. In this connection, it is considered 
advisable to concentrate efforts on the study and practical 
working out of questions of employment of air defense forces and 
assets during combined-arms operations and also when repelling 
enemy air strikes. 
  Considerable attention in the future must be given to 
working 
out questions of organizing and conducting air battles and 
engagements, which is dictated by the place and role of fighter 
aviation in the country's overall air defense system. Chinese 
military experts emphasize that air defense capabilities can be 
increased by stepping up scientific research and experimental 
design work, expanding production of modern operational systems 
and arms, increasing the level of automation, improving engineer 
and logistic support, camouflage, concealment, and deception, 
and also by stepping up reconnaissance and electronic warfare. 
  On the whole, close attention is being given to the 
development of air defense forces and assets in China, which is 
associated with the proclamation of the defensive military 
doctrine as the basis for organizational development of the 
armed forces. The increase in the importance of air defense is 
determined by its future role as one of the important components 
of national "deterrence forces." It is planned to further 
improve China's air defense within the framework of a 
coordinated military-technical policy, in which the development 
and deployment of new weapons systems and military equipment are 
closely linked to studying the operational-strategic forms of 
their employment and other aspects of organizational development 
of the armed forces.

  [Text] With the start of the space age, the most 
economically developed countries sought to use the results of 
space research for military purposes. The United States and the 
former Soviet Union achieved the greatest results. The leading 
West European states lagged behind them in this considerably, 
primarily due to their limited resources. However, as the 
economy strengthened and the scientific potential increased, the 
attitude toward space research in Europe changed. The promising 
nature of space research and development is becoming 
increasingly more obvious, which contributes to these countries' 
aspiration to combine efforts in implementing a joint 
military-space policy. 
  There are significant differences between U.S. military 
space 
projects and those of Europe. Thus, for the United States, the 
global envelopment of territories by space systems is of great 
importance due to its geopolitical aspirations. Having 
recognized the advantages of space-based communications, 
intelligence collection, and navigation systems, the United 
States explored space with direct participation of military 
agencies. Virtually all the most important research in the area 
of potential use of space at the turn of the 1950's-1960's was 
organized and conducted by the Pentagon. 
  In Western Europe, work on space was initially conducted 
primarily for scientific research purposes and was concentrated 
primarily in the civilian sector. Considerably less attention 
was given to military space projects. The entry into the space 
age was marked by the creation of a number of space 
organizations. The most notable among them in the 1960's were 
the European Space Research Organization, the International 
Space Communications Organization, and the European Organization 
for the Development of Booster Rockets. 
  Later on, based on amassed experience of cooperation of 
European countries, the European Space Agency was created in May 
1975, which continues its activities to this day. It unites 13 
states: France, Great Britain, the FRG, Italy, Spain, Belgium, 
Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, 
Australia, and Norway. Canada participates in the work of this 
organization based on an agreement on mutual cooperation, and 
Finland is an associate member. 
  Coordination of the efforts of the countries of Europe has 
also made it possible to set the foundation for development of 
joint military space projects. Nevertheless, right up to the 
present, such projects have remained almost completely national, 
and their proportion in space research have been considerably 
less than civilian projects. 
  Today, European NATO countries have outlined a number of 
areas of using military space systems in which they are directly 
interested. These include command and control, communications, 
reconnaissance, navigation, meteorology, and manned space 
flights. A NATO-wide military space-based communications system 
has already been created and is in operation. 
  On the threshold of the 21st century, countries such as 
France, Great Britain, and the United States, already having 
their own space-based systems, will be faced with the need to 
put a new generation of satellites into service. This opens the 
way for possible cooperation not only within the framework of 
Europe but also with the United States (for example, in the area 
of standardization and introduction of standardized onboard 
relay equipment with the standard requirements for 
communications channels and data that can be transmitted, which 
is an additional incentive for integration of military space 
projects). 
  As far as the contribution of individual West European 
countries to space research is concerned, France and Great 
Britain are the most independent. Today, they are the only ones 
that have military space-based systems in operation. However, 
other countries of Europe are also working in this direction. 
  France has the lead among West European countries for the 
level of state financing of space programs and scale of work in 
the areas of space study and exploration. The beginning of 
independent research was set forth by the creation of a 
ballistic missile for the armed forces. Later, it developed its 
own Ariane-1 booster rocket under the direction of the National 
Space Research Center. It began qualification testing on 24 
December 1979, and after three successful launches was put into 
series production. 
  Thanks to the presence of a developed aerospace industry in 
the country, the foundation has been laid for a powerful 
military-space complex. Such organizations as Arianespace, 
Matra, Aerospatiale, Alcatele, and others play a leading role in 
it. 
  French firms are active in a number of national and 
international space programs, mainly those under the direction 
of the European Space Agency and other interstate organizations. 
Experts estimate that France's spending on space is the highest 
in the countries of Western Europe; in 1991 it was 16,561 
billion francs. Approximately 13,000 people are employed in the 
aerospace industry. 
  The efforts of the civilian sector are bolsterd by financing 
of military space projects. According to former French Minister 
of Defense B. Jacques, the budget for military space in fiscal 
year 1991 was 3.5 billion francs. This reflects the general 
trend of accelerating the process of transferring space funds to 
the center of the country's defense program developed in 
accordance with the "Annual Plan for Space" and being 
implemented since 1990. The plan is for up to the year 2010 and 
is adjusted annually (from 1991). It is planned to increase 
appropriations for new space projects, which may double during 
the next 10 years. As experts believe, even if the budget for 
military space in France reaches 5-6 billion francs by the year 
2000, it will still one-twentieth the U.S. budget, estimated at 
100 billion francs. 
  The success of France's space industry as a whole (civilian 
and military sectors) is bolstered by the presence of the 
Ariane-4 booster rocket system, a developed satellite control 
system, and a large number of ground space stations for various 
purposes and ground complexes for launching booster rockets. 
  Research and development under the Ariane Program 
is accomplished under the direction of the European Space 
Agency. France, with the largest share participation (64 percent 
of the total budget allocated for this program), together with 
other member countries of the organization, developed the 
Ariane-4 booster rocket, which is presently being used in six 
variants. A contract valued at approximately 24 billion francs 
($4.3 billion at the 1992 exchange rate) was signed in February 
1989 for production of 50 Ariane-4 booster rockets. As 
representatives of the firms participating in this contract 
emphasize, the cost of manufacturing the rockets can be 
decreased by 20 percent. A total of 120 firms from 11 West 
European countries are participating in the contract; work is 
planned for the period to 1999. The main orders are distributed 
in the following manner: Aerospatiale Corporation 
(France)--production of 50 first and 50 third rocket stages, 60 
solid-propellant boosters, and conduct of system research under 
the Ariane Program; the SEP Association (France)--about 350 
liquid-propellant Viking rocket engines and 50 liquid-propellant 
NM-7B rocket engines; the Matra Company (France)--50 
instrumentation compartments; the concern MBB-ERNO (FRG)--50 
second stages and 96 liquid-propellant boosters. 
  The work was done in two stages: Manufacture and preparation 
of the rocket for operation, and then its transfer to the 
Arianespace Corporation (Evreux, France), which launches booster 
rockets from the Couru range. By the year 2000, the Ariane-4 is 
to be replaced by the more powerful Ariane-5 rocket. 
  The Telecom space communications system has been 
in operation since 4 August 1984. It supports space 
communications of the French armed forces, as well as commercial 
and government organizations. Several modifications of the 
Telecom-1 satellite operated until 1991. They were taken out of 
orbit between August 1984 and March 1988; then the new Telecom-2 
satellite was put in service. 
  The Telecom-3 satellite is a multipurpose satellite that has 
26 relays, 21 of them (4-6 GHz and 12-14 GHz) used for 
commercial and government communications of France and other 
European countries and five for military space communications in 
the Syracuse system. Three Telecom-2 satellites, the booster 
rocket, and ground equipment are valued at 6.3 billion francs. 
The firms Alcatele Espas, Matra-Marconi, and Aerospatiale have 
proposed to create the Telecom-2D to extend the operating life 
of the Telecom system. Its launch is scheduled for 1996. 
  The total weight of the new satellite has been increased by 
80 percent, its payload has tripled, and the operation of the 
power sources has been increased 4.5-fold. The capacity of the 
communications channels in the C-band are four television 
programs and 16,000 telephone subscribers, which enables France 
to increase the total capacity of space communications by 15 
percent a year and double the number of television programs. 
  The general-purpose Eurostar platform, used as the base for 
Telecom-2, has developed by Matra and British Aerospace, united 
under the supervision of the international Franco-British 
organization Satcom. It is a variant of the Eurostar-2000 
platform, which took four years to develop (at a cost of 300 
million francs). The Satcom organization has ordered nine 
Eurostar platforms (four Eurostar-1000 and five Eurostar-2000 
platforms) for three types of satellites (Inmarsat-2, Telecom-2, 
and Hispasat). In addition, a variant of the platform 
Eurostar-3000 is being developed for a new heavy satellite 
weighing four tonnes. Representatives of Matra have already 
expressed a readiness to receive a contract to the end of 1993 
and manufacture such a platform. According to the development 
engineers, it will correspond to the new generation of 
American-made GSTAR communications satellites or the Eurosat and 
Eutelsat advanced European satellites scheduled for launch in 
1998. 
  Ground stations of the Telecom system include transmitter 
and 
receiver equipment and a terminal for processing signals 
received from the satellites and communications with user 
equipment. The equipment includes an antenna, power unit and 
antenna switch, a frequency converter, amplifiers, and 
transceivers. Signals are transmitted over five frequencies at a 
speed of 125 megabits per second (25 megabits per second per 
frequency). A total of 310 communications terminals (62 per 
frequency) can connect to each ground station. All ground 
stations operating in the Telecom system are equipped with TDMA 
terminals. Some of these terminals are connected directly to 
users by nonswitching communication lines, and some are 
connected to an Alcatele-10 switch station. The TDMA interface 
supports connection of a large number of users, as well as 
coding and decoding devices, facsimile machines for telecopying, 
and other equipment. 
  Thus, the Telecom-2 system has higher characteristics 
compared to its predecessor (Telecom-1); the number of ground 
stations and intensity of radio traffic have increased; 
protection against intentional and unintentional interference 
has increased; new stations are used for the top level of 
tactical direction and also for nuclear-powered 
ballistic-missile submarines [SSBN]; the area of coverage has 
increased; and it supports automatic establishment of 
communications with users and flexible configuration of the 
system. 
  The military space communications system Syracuse 
officially began to be developed in 1980, and the first 
Telecom-1 satellite with Syracuse-1 equipment was launched in 
August 1984. The French Ministry of Defense has been operating 
the Syracuse-1 system since 1985. It uses Telecom satellites, 
although it has its own ground stations. The firm Alcatele Espas 
was the chief contractor for placing the Syracuse system payload 
on the Telecom satellite and developing ground stations. The 
request for proposal for the system included requirements for 
use of the satellite (type of communications, traffic capacity 
of the channels, location of ground stations, and others) as 
well as for technical characteristics (payload weight, occupied 
space, power consumption and radiation, operating frequency 
range, and so forth). All decisions for the Syracuse system were 
made with direct participation of a commission of the Main 
Armament Directorate, which is responsible to the French 
Ministry of Defense for acquisition of weapon systems. 
  The Syracuse is intended for organizing communications 
between ships and ground stations (shore and naval bases) and 
also between field units located within and outside the country. 
The system covers the territory from the West Indies to Reunion 
Island in the Indian Ocean (roughly between 70 degrees north 
latitude and 70 degrees south latitude). Two relays were 
installed on each of the first satellites. They had a 40-MHz 
frequency bandwidth and a radiating power of 20 watts and 
operated on frequencies of 7-8 GHz. The estimated service life 
of the equipment on the satellite was seven years. 
  Ground stations (fixed, mobile, transportable) use modems to 
transmit scrambled data at a speed of 75 bits per second, 2.4 
kilobits per second, and 16 kilobits per second using delta 
modulation and vocoder coding devices, which provide the system 
a high degree of noise immunity and multistation access to the 
network. Many ground station elements are standardized, which 
simplifies their operation. The station's main operating modes 
are telephone, telegraph, and data transmission. 
  Fixed ground stations (the largest in size) serve as centers 
for exchanging information in the system. They can operate 
simultaneously over two communications channels with satellites. 
One station is the lead station and distributes the network 
resources according to requirements. Users are linked to the 
fixed ground stations through a military network with the help 
of automatic control and monitoring devices. The station 
antennas (8 meters in diameter) are parabolic in shape. 
  Mobile ground stations include a cross-country vehicle 
having 
a protected compartment, antenna devices with antennas and 
low-noise amplifiers, connecting cables, and diesel generators. 
The compartment houses transceiver equipment and an air 
conditioner. When operating under field conditions, the 
transport vehicle is in an immobile state. The 1.3-meter 
diameter antenna is set up at a distance of 2 meters from the 
vehicle and connected by cable to the transceiver equipment. It 
is pointed at the satellite manually. A remote control device 
can be moved 400 meters from the station. Preparation time is 
less than one hour. There is a three-person crew. 
  The composition of transportable stations is the same as for 
mobile systems, but the antenna is larger (3 meters in 
diameter). They operate around the clock, increasing traffic 
capacity of the communications channels. A four-person crew 
prepares the transportable station for operation within 2 hours. 
The antenna is pointed at the satellite manually. 
  Ship-borne stations have a protected compartment mounted on 
the ship's deck, two antennas covered by radar-transparent 
materials, and electronic equipment (transceivers, control 
consoles, terminals, test equipment, and so forth). The 
1.5-meter diameter antennas are installed on the ship in such a 
way that regardless of its position, at least one of them can be 
pointed at the satellite. The antenna orientation can be done 
manually or automatically. A station was developed for 
submarines in July 1991. Series production of these stations 
began in 1992 and will continue until 1997. 
  Maintenance of all types of stations, up to and including 
replacing units, is accomplished by their crew. 
  During the period 1985-1987, the French armed forces had 25 
stations for the Syracuse space communications system--3 fixed, 
9 mobile, 3 transportable, and 11 ship-borne. 
  An SCC satellite control center located at the National 
Space 
Center, an alternate control center combined with a fixed ground 
space communications center (M4), and a satellite tracking 
network (TTC) are in operation to control the Syracuse 
satellites. 
  To further develop the Syracuse system, in 1983 the General 
Armament Office instructed the firm Alcatele Espas to develop a 
new generation of Syracuse equipment with an increased 
traffic-carrying capacity and new ground stations with improved 
jamming protection. In January 1987, the new Syracuse-2 system 
project was ready and approved by the French Ministry of 
Defense. It calls for using Telecom-2 satellites with an 
operating life of 10 years. Eight billion francs were allocated 
for implementation of the project. 
  France does not rule out the possibility of concluding 
treaties with other countries for the joint design and 
manufacture of the Syracuse-2 system that meets international 
standards (with optimal distribution of financial resources). 
  The Syracuse ground stations already in operation will be 
able to operate in the Syracuse-2 system. In addition, new types 
of stations will be deployed with antennas 0.4-0.9 meters in 
diameter and designed for installation on submarines, light 
transport vehicles, and aircraft. The functions of the network 
control center will be carried out by two fixed lead stations 
with antennas 18 meters in diameter located on the territory of 
France. They will be able to receive remote coordinate 
measurement signals from satellites and transmit control 
instructions. 
  The first satellite with Syracuse-2 equipment was launched 
by 
an Ariane booster rocket on 16 December 1991, the second on 15 
April 1992, and the third is scheduled to be launched in June 
1994. This will make it possible to extend operation of the 
Syracuse-2 to the year 2005. Besides the tasks entrusted to its 
predecessor, the Syracuse-2 system will provide communications 
for the General Staff of the French armed forces, the main 
staffs of the armed services, the rapid deployment forces, and 
SSBN's on alert duty. The new ground stations began to enter 
service in mid-1992. 
  The Syracuse-2 system has a number of advantages compared to 
the Syracuse-1 system: An increased number of communication 
channels and ground stations serviced; improved ground station 
specifications and performance characteristics; ability to tie 
in with other communications systems, including ground systems 
(via fixed stations deployed on the territory of the country); 
expanded zone of operations of communications, taking into 
account the needs of the armed forces to the year 2000; and 
increased operating stability in jamming conditions. The system 
is comparable to the American DSCS-3 and the British Skynet 
systems, and in some cases is superior to them. 
  The Spot space system is a commercial program for 
studying the earth's natural resources. It is designed to obtain 
images of sections of the earth's surface and makes it possible 
to study specific sections and conduct surveillance in the 
satellite's visibility range. 
  The Spot system is made up of satellites in orbit, a control 
and preliminary data processing center, and ground receiving 
stations. The first Spot-1 satellite was launched in 1986. By 1 
January 1991, 1.9 million images had been received from it. The 
satellite was able to perform its tasks 95.5 percent of the time 
of its operation. The high operational indicators made it 
possible to delay the launch of the next Spot-2 satellite from 
1988 to 1990 (the launch took place on 22 January 1991). 
  Operation of two satellites in 1990 made it possible to make 
repeat examinations of terrain sectors at shorter time intervals 
and to obtain identical images of the same objects from 
different satellites. In early 1991, the Spot-1 satellite ceased 
transmitting images. 
  The success of the Spot-1 program helped the allocation of 
funds for creating the Spot-2 and -4 satellites, with launch 
scheduled for 1993 and 1996, respectively. They are being 
developed by the firm Matra, weigh up to 1.3 tonnes, and have 
three-axis stabilization and a large reserve of onboard fuel, 
which ensures functioning in orbit for 4-5 years. The Spot-3 has 
been assembled, shipped for storage, and is ready for launch; 
Spot-4 is in the assembly stage. Of the 10 billion francs 
allocated for the program, 7.3 billion will go toward the 
creation and operation of spacecraft alone. It is planned to 
operate the Spot-4 satellite until the year 2001. In addition, 
work is being conducted on the Spot-5 project and development of 
the next generation of satellites. 
  The pictures received from the Spot satellites in digital 
form go to the ground stations and are processed. Images of the 
sections of the earth's surface are transmitted to consumers 
already in the form of photographs with a resolution of 10 
meters for black-and-white and 20 meters for color image on an 
area of 60x60 km. They can be used for military purposes. Thus, 
during the military operations in the Persian Gulf, the Spot 
system serviced the multinational forces command. 
  In August 1990, the firm Spot Image ceased commercial 
distribution of images of the Middle East areas in connection 
with the crisis that emerged. This was caused by the need to 
preclude information from falling into the hands of the Iraqi 
armed forces command authorities. During the fighting in Kuwait, 
information from the satellites was widely used by the 
multinational forces when selecting strike targets, updating 
maps of the region, and identifying roads, airfields, and 
individual objects. The pictures were made available to the 
governments of the countries of the anti-Iraqi coalition and 
Israel. The cost of one black-and-white picture was $500. On 22 
March 1992, the firm resumed the unrestricted sale of 
photographs of the earth's surface. 
  In addition, the Spot space system was used by the U.S. 
Department of Defense to detect laser emissions from the 
territory of the CIS countries. The Spot satellite was the first 
to transmit data on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident 
and the explosion of a gas combine in Libya. 
  The ground control and preliminary data processing center 
functioning in the Spot system is equipped with a receiving 
station and equipment making it possible to process data 
received from the satellite and to store and convert them into 
high-quality photographic images. It produces a standard product 
in the form of photographs and monitors its delivery to 
consumers. 
  A final assessment of image quality and adjustment (if 
necessary) is made once a month. The main quality criteria are: 
Accuracy of determining the location of pictures on the earth's 
surface, geometric accuracy, possibility of multispectral 
recording, stereoscopic accuracy, signal-to-noise ratio and 
adjustment of the detector parameters, absolute accuracy of 
calibration, and so forth. 
  The network of ground receiving stations is intended for 
receipt of data, its conversion, processing, and generation of 
photographs. During the operation of the system, it was 
constantly expanded. Additional receiving stations were put into 
service in Hartebisteck (South Africa), Alice Springs 
(Australia), and Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) in 1989, and stations 
began operating in 1990 in the vicinity of the Cotopaxi volcano 
(Ecuador) and in Beijing (China). Thus, by April 1991 there were 
14 ground stations deployed, including on the territory of 
Israel. Today, stations are being put into service in Indonesia, 
New Zealand, Kenya, Bangladesh, and other countries. The fee for 
use of the receiving station is 5-13 million francs. 
  The system for controlling French satellites, 
created by the early 1980's, included three stations and ensured 
control of satellites in orbit of the Telecom and Spot national 
space systems. The stations were designated M4, M3, and M2. They 
are deployed in the French home country: Frans Sud (M4), Favier 
(M3), and Lanveok (M2). 
  The M4 station is the central operating station in the 
Telecom and Syracuse-2 systems. It is equipped with two 18-meter 
antennas, one of which is a reserve, and one 8-meter antenna. In 
addition, the station has transceiver equipment and equipment 
for checking radio equipment aboard the satellite. 
  The M3 station is equipped with two antennas (18 and 8 
meters) and also a set of communications and monitoring 
equipment. It can be also used as the central station. The M2 
station has one 8-meter antenna and communications equipment. 
  The system control center is located at Toulouse, Couru, and 
Pretoria (South Africa). As a result of further work to expand 
the network of ground stations, the National Space Research 
Center put into operation two new stations--on Kerguelen Island 
(1989) and at Saint Pierre-et-Miquelon (1990). Their deployment 
made it possible to achieve a number of advantages of a 
technical (ensures control from the first circuit), political 
(all stations of the control system are located on its own 
territory), and economic nature (a technical base has been 
created at these places for performing the work in space). The 
location of the stations was selected in such a way that the 
Spot or Helios satellites could be controlled in the 
first-fourth circuits of their orbits and satellites in 
geostationary orbits. The cost of the work to deploy the network 
of ground stations is 100 million francs. 
  Cooperation with other countries is envisioned on matters of 
satellite control. This strengthens France's prestige and makes 
it possible to involve European states in cooperation and use of 
the national system for control of European military satellites 
of the NATO bloc. 
  The main command and control center (Toulouse) is the one 
best equipped with technical complexes and electronic equipment 
(cost of the equipment is 10 million francs). This is the first 
center in Western Europe that ensures control of the satellite 
in a geostationary orbit, and its capabilities are constantly 
expanding. 
  The leadership of France does not intend to change its view 
and priorities in the area of developing national military space 
systems, which Helios, Cerise, Osiris, Xenon, and a number of 
other programs within the framework of the European Community 
are. 
  The Helios space observation system is being 
developed jointly by France, Italy, and Spain. The idea of 
creating it belongs to France, which is linked to the desire to 
get rid of the dependence on American space systems to satisfy 
its own needs in the area of space reconnaissance. In addition, 
the leadership of France believes that the possession of nuclear 
weapons should be combined with the availability of its own 
military space reconnaissance system. Work on the Helios program 
began in the mid-1980's, and it was subsequently opened up for 
international cooperation. Italy has participated since 1987 and 
Spain since 1988. Their proportion of the total expenditures 
(approximately 7 billion francs) are 14 and 7 percent, 
respectively. 
  The Helios satellite (Figure 1 [not reproduced]) is 
developed 
based on the Spot-4 satellite (platform, onboard recording 
equipment, and a considerable portion of the electronic 
equipment). The main difference will be in the optical train and 
in the means of protecting telemetry data from enemy jamming. It 
will support conducting reconnaissance in the optical and 
infrared wavebands with a resolution of up to 1 meter, which 
exceeds the capabilities of the Spot-2 equipment by an order of 
magnitude. 
  The committee overseeing the Helios program, structurally 
part of the Main Armament Directorate of the French Ministry of 
Defense, includes French officers and one officer each from 
Italy and Spain. The main contractor for developing the space 
components of the system is the KNES Corporation, and Matra 
Espas is the main contractor for the satellite and ground 
components of the Helios system. 
  It is assumed that a second generation will follow the first 
generation of Helios satellites, which are to be launched in 
1994 and 1995. Additional infrared equipment will be installed 
on them. 
  The feasibility study of the international cooperation for 
creating the Helios system emphasized that the entire volume of 
work, including ground equipment, constructing and launching the 
first three satellites, will require expenditures of 10 billion 
francs, but the cost of each additional satellite will be only 
1-1.5 billion francs. This will enable each country, by creating 
its own components for this system, to have a national space 
reconnaissance system for accomplishing its own tasks. The 
obvious advantage of joint work on the Helios system is 
stimulating the participation in this program by other European 
countries. Presently, the Helios-1A and B satellites are being 
assembled at Toulouse. The work is classified, as is the 
construction of the two Helios command and control centers at 
Francazal Air Base and at the National Space Center. 
  The Cerise Space System. The Main Armament 
Directorate of the French Ministry of Defense and the Alcatele 
Espas Corporation were forced to admit on 8 April 1992 that a 
space system was being developed at Toulouse based on miniature 
satellites, which was given the name Cerise 
(CERISE--Caracterisation del L'Environement Radielectrigue par 
un Instrument Spatial Embarque). This system, intended for 
determining the characteristics of electronic radiation using 
space instrumentation, will make it possible to form a data bank 
of electronic equipment. The program includes development of a 
miniature satellite weighing 50 kg based on the Uosat platform 
of the British firm Suroy Satellite Technology, which will also 
supply a unique command and control station for this satellite. 
A picture of the Cerise satellite is shown in Figure 2 [not 
reproduced]. The satellite will be placed into an orbit 400-600 
km high, be stabilized using a mast 10 meters long, and occupy a 
volume of 40x40x60 cm. The payload includes transceiver 
equipment and electronic radiation recording equipment operating 
on a frequency of 1-20 GHz. The satellite is scheduled to be put 
into space by an Ariane booster rocket in mid-1994. The cost of 
the launch will be 5 million francs, and expenditures for the 
entire system are estimated at 80 million francs. 
  The Xenon space system will be France's first 
full-scale space system for electronic intelligence collection. 
Its equipment is being created based on the Cerise and Eurocom 
systems. The cost of the project is 5 billion francs; launch of 
the satellite is scheduled for 1999. Two competing consortia are 
working on this project: Matra-Marconi Space - Dassault 
Electronic and Alcatele Espas-Tomson-CSF. 
  In addition, the firms Matra-Marconi Space, Alcatele Espas, 
and Aerospatiale are conducting research on new French space 
programs calling for the creation of a radar reconnaissance 
satellites. These include the Osiris system (Figure 3 [not 
reproduced]) and the civilian Radar 2000 system. The latter was 
given the name Spot Radar in 1992 to clearly separate the 
satellites in the Spot family. It is in the stage of scientific 
study, which has been going on since 1989. Selection of the 
designs is scheduled for 1994, and launch of the satellite for 
after the year 2000. The Spot-4 platform served as the base for 
the satellite. This will make it possible to use dual-purpose 
technology (military and civilian) and save on resources. 
  A demonstration model of an active antenna with 100 
transceiving modules has already been developed by the firm 
Alcatele Espas. Testing will be conducted in space in late 1993 
or in early 1994. The Space Research Center has been financing 
this work for 3 years now, and costs are estimated at 50-60 
million francs. The firm has been conducting work under the 
Osiris program for 4 years now and has spent more than 10 
billion francs. 
  A group of development engineers under the direction of Jean 
Claude Husson has already created the Poseidon height-finding 
radar, which is carried on the Topex satellite (developed for 
NASA by the American firm Fairchild Space--a branch of Matra). 
This satellite with the Poseidon radar on board, which can be 
used for civilian and military purposes, was launched in July 
1992. Total financing for this project is estimated at 127 
million francs. 
  Alcatele Espas, jointly with the firms Argos and Steria SBS, 
has its own project for an operational height-finding satellite 
that is designated Salto. This small satellite weighing 250 kg 
can be created on the basis of an American platform of the firm 
GM or TRW. The payload (100 kg) will include radiometric 
equipment, the Poseidon height-finding radar, and a precision 
coordinate measurement system of the Doris platform in orbit, 
which has already been mounted on the Topex and Spot-2 
satellites. According to the development engineers, the Salto 
will supply national naval forces with oceanographic data on a 
global scale.

  [Text] Today, radar early-warning and control aircraft are 
an effective means of supporting combat operations, which is 
confirmed by the results of recent military conflicts. 
Therefore, many countries are working on creating new and 
improving existing radar early-warning systems. 
  The Israeli firm Elta has developed a fundamentally new 
radar 
early-warning system, which has been given the name Falcon. The 
first experimental model is already undergoing ground and flight 
testing, and series production is scheduled to begin in 1994. 
The American Boeing 707 has been chosen as the platform for the 
new system. As Israeli military experts claim, the equipment for 
the Falcon system costs less than half the radar early-warning 
and control equipment installed on the E-3A Sentry. 
  The radar antenna for the E-3A aircraft is positioned above 
the upper part of the fuselage, which disrupts the aircraft's 
aerodynamics. This adversely affects handling and stability 
(especially on takeoff and landing), as well as fatigue of 
mounting points, limiting aircraft operating life. The onboard 
radar of the Falcon system has six conformal antennas: One is 
located in the forward part of the fuselage, and the other five 
are positioned along a longitudinal line along the skin of the 
fuselage on the left and right sides and in the tail unit. 
  The E-3A's radar for detection, discrimination, and 
classification of air targets requires two to three complete 
rotations of the antenna (about 30 seconds), but the new radar 
needs 2-4 seconds, which increases the accuracy of determining 
coordinates several-fold. 
  If a target is maneuvering, the radar uses a special 
operating mode. Depending on the size, altitude, speed, and 
angular rotation of the target, the pulse repetition frequency 
is selected automatically, which makes it possible to classify 
the target (helicopter, fighter, transport, etc.). When radar 
early-warning aircraft is flying at medium altitude, the 
detection range is 150 km for a helicopter or cruise missile, 
350 km for a tactical fighter, and up to 500 km for a bomber or 
surface ship. 
  The Falcon radar's technical capabilities make it possible 
to 
obtain a high degree of accuracy in determining target 
coordinates in any, even extreme, weather conditions. The 
radar's operating mode with a variable pulse repetition 
frequency makes it possible to accomplish constant observation 
in a specific sector, which is very important when supporting 
combat operations in an individual areas. 
  The onboard equipment includes the EL/L 8312 communications 
and electronic intelligence collection equipment, making it 
possible to detect mobile and fixed sources of radar emissions 
with a high degree of accuracy. The Elta firm has also developed 
several variants of onboard electronic warfare equipment for 
specific clients. 
  In addition to NATO, states of the Middle East and Southeast 
Asia are showing an interest in acquiring the Falcon system. 
  The radar early-warning and control aircraft based on the 
Boeing 707 has the following characteristics: 12,000 km flight 
range; 12-13 hours flight duration without aerial refueling; 
40,000 kg payload. Its 33.8-meter long cabin accommodates 17 
operators. The Boeing 757 and C-130 transport aircraft, which do 
not have great flight range, can also be used to house this 
equipment. Any airliner that can transport 50 passengers or 5 
tonnes of cargo can be a platform for the Falcon equipment.

<F P=106> [Article by Capt 3d Rank A. Kolesov] </F>
  [Text] Today the United States is completing work on 
creating the Advanced Combat Direction System (ACDS) for surface 
ships. Its variant--the ACDS Block 1, being developed by a 
scientific research subdivision of the surveillance and command 
and control center in San Diego, California--underwent testbed 
trials in early 1992 at a special coastal combat information 
center using an extensive simulator of reflecting targets to 
check the capabilities and reliability of the system. In order 
to conduct sea trials of the ACDS, Block 1 is to be installed 
aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70). 
  The new ACDS has three loops, each of which embodies the 
principle of similar source integration (SSI): Sonar environment 
[SE] SSI; radar environment [RE] SSI; and electronic environment 
[EE] SSI. 
  Like previous systems, the ACDS Block 1 is intended 
primarily 
for air defense; however, it possesses a significantly increased 
range of operation, a higher degree of automation, and higher 
level of target tracking. The system provides for the capability 
of changing and correcting software both in the process of sea 
trials and during future operation in the fleet. Although the 
ACDS was developed for aircraft carriers, it also can be 
installed aboard amphibious warfare ships and cruisers. 
  The EE SSI loop is the main element of the entire system of 
electronic support of battle groups. Thanks to it, electronic 
intelligence [ELINT] sets and electronic environment channels of 
electronic warfare [EW] systems will be able to operate 
together, which will make it possible to create a single picture 
of the tactical situation for the battle group commanders. And 
although the EE SSI loop was combined for the first time with 
other loops in the new ACDS, in the future it is planned to 
include it in all combat direction systems in the fleet. 
  This loop will accomplish exchange over digital 
communications channels with information sources, triangulation, 
and tracking of radiating electronic systems and their platforms 
on a real-time basis; compare the results with returns from the 
radar and IFF system; classify the radiating targets; eliminate 
information that does not match; and display the tactical 
situation on displays of the battle group units. This will make 
electronic detection a completely automated process, changing 
the very view of building a picture of the electronic 
environment. 
  The EE SSI loop is designed to automatically connect the 
bearing line to the radiating electronic system and the 
parametric outputs of information sources. The latter may be 
ELINT sets and electronic environment channels of EW systems, 
such as the WLR-1H, SLQ-32 and SLQ-17 (installed on aircraft 
carriers), SLQ-32 and WLQ-16 (on cruisers, destroyers, and 
frigates), ALQ-142 (on SH-60B Seahawk helicopters), ALR-66 (on 
P-3C Orion aircraft), ALR-76 and ULQ-20 (on S-3B and ES-3A 
Viking carrier-based aircraft), and ALR-73 (on E-2C Hawkeye 
carrier-based airborne early warning [AEW] aircraft). 
  The S-3B and P-3C aircraft can exchange information with 
surface ships both directly and via E-2C AEW aircraft, but the 
SH-60 helicopters and ES-3A aircraft can do so only with their 
own ship platform. Surface ships also receive information from 
ELINT satellites and enter it into the system. 
  The EE SSI is designed to use the Link-16 jamming-resistant, 
high-capacity, digital communications line, which is part of the 
JTIDS (Joint Tactical Information Distribution System) system. 
Link-16 provides information to a special subnet for exchange of 
commands and reports on the electronic environment. Tactical 
units of a battle group and its supporting aircraft tied into 
this system can receive a picture of the overall situation 
generated by the EE SSI loop of the flag ship and supplement it 
with their own data, regardless of whether or not their loop has 
wide capabilities. Using the new target data processing 
equipment, the control station officer will be able to provide a 
single electronic image to all Link-16 subscribers. 
  The same processes occur on the Link-16 digital 
communications line as on the Link-11, but with greater accuracy 
and intensity. In order to increase the efficiency of the EE SSI 
loop, in 1989 NATO experts approved changes in the standard 
messages of the EE subnet of the Link-16 line. 
  The loop operates in the following manner. With receipt of 
the sum total of bearing lines from the information sources and 
also data on frequency, pulse spacing, and pulse scanning period 
in the system, they are first compared to one another and then 
with radar returns. This process is automated and controlled 
using a computer. When the next report from an information 
source comes into the system, it determines if a corresponding 
report is in the system. If there is, the computer identifies 
the bearing lines and marks the radiating electronic system at 
their intersection, which is then compared to the radar return. 
If there is no corresponding report in the system, the loop 
compares the bearing line to the radiating source with the radar 
return, simultaneously continuing select a pair. These processes 
proceed continuously, so a return from a radiating target can be 
formed, for example, from a single bearing line taken at a great 
distance into a moving areas of probable target locations 
(ellipse). It can then supplemented by a second and third 
bearing line taken from the same or a different source, compared 
with the newly appeared radar return, and return to the starting 
position of the bearing line, when the supporting forces have 
lost electronic contact (their tracking is done according to 
radar data), or continue to exist in the system, even if there 
is no radar contact. Under certain conditions, for example, if 
the enemy is not using restrictions in the operation of 
electronic systems, the EE SSI loop can display the tactical 
situation without turning on the radar. 
  It must be re-emphasized that the EE SSI loop accomplishes 
the comparison of bearing lines based on measured parameters and 
not on the results of classification of radiation sources, which 
may be presented later. In other words, two intersecting bearing 
lines having the same frequency, pulse spacing, and scanning 
period will be connected automatically by the loop regardless of 
whether or not the appropriate classification data are in the 
computer memory. The design of the question contains a postulate 
that a false association is worse than missing an association. 
If the pair does not coincide accurately enough according to the 
measured parameters, an association will not occur and the 
bearing lines will not be connected. The decisions by the 
computer, just like those by a person, may be incorrect; 
therefore, the loop's software provides for the capability of 
operator intervention in the into the computer operations to 
change manually the target classification and identification 
results. 
  Each mark of a radiating electronic system, based on one or 
several bearing lines, is processed by a Kalman filter, which 
with the passage of time "clears up" the assumed position of the 
radiating source. Measurement of the bearings does not have to 
be simultaneous in order to receive a good result. Subscribers 
may transmit data about the electronic environment quickly or 
slowly, depending on the situation, without special coordination 
of their actions. The operator recording the mark of the 
radiating target on the display can see how the size of the 
areas of possible target location will decrease as additional 
bearings are received from the information sources, and the 
heading and speed of the radiating source gradually stabilizes, 
nearing the actual value. Despite the fact that the Kalman 
filter works more effectively with a large number of incoming 
reports, the target movement elements can be analyzed when just 
one subscriber reports on the radiating target. 
  The EE SSI loop plays the primary role in the process of 
classifying ungrouped radiating targets in the ACDS Block 1. The 
parametric data of each return of a radiating electronic system 
are compared with the parameters in the computer memory, as a 
result of which a listing of possible radiation sources is 
produced. It is very rare that just one source is given, since 
the ranges of the parameters of the various electronic systems 
overlap considerably. 
  For each class of radiation sources there exists a set of 
probable platforms on which it can be installed. If several 
radiating electronic systems are detected at one point in space, 
the potential adversary is located at the spot of intersection 
of the lists of probable platforms of each of them. Data on 
target speed and altitude from the RE SSI loop are also used to 
reduce the list of possible platforms. The computer calculates 
the likelihood of the existence of each class of targets. 
  The ACDS Block 1 and its EE SSI operate in close 
interconnection with other systems. The sets of data from 
information sources, according to which they make the decisions, 
and the decisions themselves circulate over the JTIDS 
communications system with other ships. The easy-to-understand 
picture of the overall environment generated by the ACDS of the 
flag ship is transmitted to each ship without the aid of the 
costly installation of the ACDS. 
  In addition to the problem of creating a combined picture of 
the overall environment for ships of the battle group, the 
following problem causes difficulty for American experts: How to 
avoid unnecessary duplication of primary information being 
received by tactical units where the situation analysis is done, 
which may arise due to the great spatial multichanneling in the 
digital communications line. This is particularly important when 
analyzing the electronic environment where the time sequence of 
data being received plays an determining role. American experts 
see the solution to the problem in changing the standard 
messages being transmitted over the Link-16 channels, which was 
discussed above, and also in ensuring a single target numbering 
system both for tactical units of the group and for supporting 
forces. 
  When an operation on one of the ships of the group 
intervenes 
in the operations of the computer and does the association 
manually, the same thing automatically takes place on the other 
ships, too. Such a decision is due to the fact that each ship 
has tracking data which is not entered into its circuit, but is 
integrated into its local picture. The information received from 
its own sources is more complete and has a higher confidence 
level than that transmitted from distant sources. 
  American experts believe that it is impossible to ensure a 
completely identical picture of the tactical situation on each 
ship of the group, but it is realistic to receive a combined 
picture. To do this, it is necessary to distribute the duties 
beforehand among those involved in the search. One reports only 
radio frequencies, another the pulse spacing, and still another 
the scanning period. Manual and automated information sources 
operate together in order to produce an artificial uniform 
product for relay to other subscribers. Manual sensors are used 
to divide up the parameters to be transmitted, and automated 
sensors are used to divide up the search sectors. One merit of 
the EE SSI loop is the fact that any variants of distributing 
duties is suitable for it. 
  As is noted in the Western press, detection of battle groups 
using electronic assets today is considerably more effective 
than using radar assets. In particular, it notes the 
disproportion of efforts expended by servicing personnel on 
analyzing the electronic environment and the results obtained. 
Even on the newest ships of the fleet, displaying the electronic 
environment is a process that requires intensive manual labor 
and constant attention of the operator. Combat direction system 
operators must carefully compare the bearing lines by time and 
identify them with radar returns, and the signals often 
disappear before this work is finished. American experts believe 
that taking two bearings from different units with a rigid base 
(now totally at the initiative of the personnel), is a waste of 
time. It is impossible to accomplish such actions without 
coordinating over radiotelephone communications. In addition, 
operators know that only important information is worth the 
considerable efforts, and if a mistake is made in target 
classification, such a report will evoke obvious displeasure 
among the rest of those involved in analyzing the situation. 
Therefore, today personnel rarely use Link-11 for transmitting 
data on the electronic environment. Operators aboard Orion, 
Hawkeye, and Viking aircraft supporting a battle group also 
rarely report these data for the same reasons, although they 
have ELINT sets with good capabilities aboard the aircraft. An 
exception to this is the SH-60B Seahawk LAMPS-3 helicopter, 
which uses the ALQ-142 ELINT set to generate a continuous flow 
of bearings for detection of radiating sources. They are shown 
on displays of the ship platform, where the bearings are 
intersected with bearings of the onboard SLQ-32. American 
experts believe that such a fully automated exchange between the 
two units should be accomplished at the battle group level using 
the EE SSI loop. 
  The exchange of data on the electronic environment must be 
done at a pace that makes it possible to assess the dynamics of 
target movement. This work cannot be done manually, especially 
in conditions of sailing in coastal areas and in areas of heavy 
navigation, when dozens of air and surface targets are in the 
battle group's surveillance zone. 
  Development of the principle of integrating similar sources 
makes one look in a new way at certain concepts in electronic 
warfare. The word "return," which had only a simple radar 
meaning, is presented in the ACDS Block 1 actually as a 
"multi-return." It consists of connected intermediate returns of 
short- and long-range radars, identification systems, the EE 
loop, and sonar returns. Operators must clearly imagine the 
structure of this process, otherwise an incorrect identification 
will be difficult to recognize and correct. If people and 
systems such as the ACDS never made mistakes in combining, 
comparing, and classifying targets, the operator would not have 
to imagine all the particular features of the process of target 
processing by the EE loop. However, mistakes are inevitable and, 
in the opinion of American experts, servicing personnel must 
have the opportunity to correct them until the data corresponds 
to reality. 
  Automation of the process of collecting and processing data 
on the electronic environment will enable operators to analyze 
the values which they observe. Tactical units will be able to 
report intercepted bearings for the EE SSI loop, enable other to 
make decisions on their comparison, or do this themselves. It is 
necessary to observe just one technical condition: To exchange 
data over the Link-16 line. 
  It is believed that electronic surveillance and tracking 
must 
become as fully automated and integrated a process (within the 
battle group) as radar surveillance is today.

  This book is about tactical art. It details the history of 
the origin and development of fundamental principles of combined 
arms battle and reveals their essence under present conditions 
and their interrelationship with principles of operational art 
and strategy. An identification of ways and methods of 
implementing demands of tactical principles in defensive and 
offensive battle and meeting engagements, and development of 
appropriate recommendations for commanders and staffs, are the 
book's principal content. Main attention is given to new 
problem-oriented questions. The range of questions covered is 
from company to formation. The work is widely illustrated by 
diagrams and tables. 
  The work has no analogues, is distinguished by a 
non-stereotyped nature of construction and exposition, and is 
written in a lively, graphic language. Its purpose is to be a 
supplement to tactics textbooks and training manuals. The book's 
entire content is aimed at shaping officers' creative thinking, 
rejecting banality, fighting routine and conventionalism, and 
reviving tactics as a genuinely innovative art. 
  In examining the evolution of principles of battle, the 
author saw his task as showing as completely as possible the 
role of Soviet military-theoretical thought and, especially the 
contribution of prominent Soviet military leaders of the Civil 
War and Great Patriotic War in developing and enriching them. At 
the same time, the work pays proper attention to analyzing works 
on this subject published in Russia in pre-revolutionary times 
and also works of foreign authors. The book is designed for 
officers at the tactical level and for students and cadets of 
higher military educational institutions. 
<H5>  INTRODUCTION </H5>
  Principles are a "real aid or guiding star for 
the person act-ing." 
  C. von Clausewitz, "On War" 
  ...Principles of military art shine in history 
like the Sun on the horizon, so much the worse for blind men 
incapable of seeing them. 
  Napoleon 
  ...I personally was guided by them (principles of 
military art--I.V.) in preparing all operations. At 
the same time I saw that when these matters were treated 
formally, there was no success in the battle, the engagement or 
the operation. 
  G. K. Zhukov 
  Military leaders have tried to find the "elixir" of victory 
since very ancient times. Centuries went by, a countless number 
of military campaigns and engagements were conducted and a sea 
of blood was shed before inquisitive thinkers, getting to know 
accumulated combat experience and analyzing the secret "springs" 
and "levers" acting in a complex, contradictory situation, 
discovered the guiding threads and developed precepts on how to 
prepare and fight the battle. With the passage of time these 
precepts were enriched and formed into rules and official 
recommendations, which in the final account turned into an 
orderly system of principles of military art reflected in formal 
documents of regulations of all world armies. 
  Encyclopedic sources define the term "principle" as a 
fundamental rule, a guiding proposition, a direction for some 
kind of activity.[.sup]1[/] Principles of battle entered 
military theory as categories defining ties and relationships of 
various aspects of combat activity of formations, units and 
subunits; as fundamental ideas; and, as the most important 
recommendations on preparing and conducting battle.[.sup]2[/] 
Principles of military art are rightly called a coagulation of 
military wisdom, a guiding light in a military leader's command 
and control activity. The experience of many wars were 
accumulated in them; the creative inspirations of field 
generals, bitter lessons of defeats and interpreted results of 
victories were embodied in them. Principles of military art were 
passed on from generation to generation like a most valuable 
scientific baton, an inexhaustible fount of military thought. 
  Soviet military art also adopted principles of military art 
from the moment it originated, inheriting everything valuable 
that had been accumulated in past military affairs. These 
principles were reflected and developed in military regulations, 
textbooks and military-theoretical works of the young Red Army. 
Works of military authors critically revised many theoretical 
provisions of military art and of Army and Navy organizational 
development on a new methodological and material basis and 
revealed the interrelationship of principles of military art and 
laws of war. 
  But under the influence of I. V. Stalin's cult of 
personality, discussions in the press ceased in the mid-1930's 
on questions of development of strategy, operational part, and 
tactics. Statements by certain military specialists crept into 
military literature to the effect that allegedly all principles 
whatsoever were alien to Soviet military science since they 
hobbled military art. During the Great Patriotic War, Stalin 
formulated the thesis of permanently operating and temporary 
factors deciding the course and outcome of war. They were viewed 
as the chief element in Soviet military science, almost as its 
basic laws and principles, although in reality they reflected 
only certain of its areas. Thus, for example, only one factor 
was taken from the sum total of complex questions of command and 
control--the organizing abilities of command personnel. The 
importance of officers' art and of the personnel's scientific 
knowledge, combat proficiency and moral-psychological qualities 
was not taken into account. 
  The postulates of Stalinist lines, considered infallible, in 
fact suffered from one-sidedness and logical and constructive 
inconsistency, contributing to the propagation of dogmatism and 
conventionalism. The development of propositions on logical 
patterns of development of warfare and of fundamental principles 
of military art were consigned to oblivion for many years in 
Soviet military science. Only in the 1960's did provisions on 
principles of military art appear in Soviet Armed Forces field 
manuals, in textbooks and in works on military theory. 
  But the consequences of authoritarianism and of slavery to 
routine in military thinking left a negative imprint on 
military-scientific research. As applied to principles of 
military art, this was reflected in the fact that a number of 
works interpreted their content very arbitrarily. For example, 
the work "O sovetskoy voyennoy nauke" [On Soviet Military 
Science] included among principles of warfare those such as the 
immediate, swift exploitation of success of nuclear missile 
strikes for conducting an offensive against the enemy with all 
available personnel and equipment, swiftness in conducting the 
battle and operation and exploiting success in them at high 
rates, continuous strategic, operational and tactical 
reconnaissance, and so on.[.sup]3[/] 
  An especially large amount of confusion was allowed in 
formulating principles in military-philosophical works. For 
example, in spite of the provisions of regulations, the work 
"Marksistsko-leninskaya filosofiya i metodologicheskiye problemy 
voyennoy praktiki" [sic] [Marxist-Leninist Philosophy and 
Methodological Problems of Military Practice], published in 1982 
following publication of the "Sovetskaya Voyennaya 
Entsiklopediya" [Soviet Military Encyclopedia], elevated to the 
category of principles of military art those such as carefully 
planning combat operations, combining all methods and forms of 
warfare, disposing troops in depth in the battle and operation, 
and preempting the enemy in deploying and in aligning the combat 
formation.[.sup]4[/] I. A. Grudinin's monograph "Dialektika i 
sovremennoye voyennoye delo" [Dialectics and Modern Military 
Affairs] (Moscow, Voyenizdat, 1971, pp 60-61) considers one of 
the principles to be "a combination of centralization and 
decentralization of command and control." 
  The mistake of these and certain other authors in 
interpreting the principles is that they identify principles of 
battle with specific practical recommendations for its 
organization and conduct ("preempting the enemy in 
deploying...", "swiftness of operations...", "immediate 
exploitation of results of fire strikes" and so on). But if one 
follows such logic, it turns out that practically any 
requirement of a regulation on preparing and conducting battle 
can be elevated to the rank of a principle, which of course is 
not legitimate. Principles are generalized rules and logical 
constructions which stem not from some particular instance, but 
from the aggregate of many battles. Their requirements relate to 
all kinds of combat operations. 
  Principles of Soviet military art are set forth in the most 
systemized form in the "Sovetskaya Voyennaya Entsiklopediya" 
(1978), but even this fundamental work did not get by without 
oversights. It does not show the role of Soviet military leaders 
G. K. Zhukov, K. K. Rokossovskiy, A. M. Vasilevskiy, I. S. 
Konev, I. Kh. Bagramyan, A. I. Yeremenko, F. I. Tolbukhin, N. F. 
Vatutin, A. I. Antonov, I. D. Chernyakhovskiy and others at all 
in developing principles of strategy, operational art and 
tactics during the Great Patriotic War. For fully understandable 
reasons (limited volume), the "Entsiklopediya" set forth the 
principles in summary form. And this is essentially the only 
military-theoretical work where principles of military art are 
considered from a contemporary standpoint. 
  Thus, such an important methodological category as 
principles 
of military art, which is of exceptional importance for 
cognition and development of strategy, operational art and 
tactics, has not received in-depth, comprehensive study in our 
military literature up to the present time. Principles of modern 
combined arms battle are revealed especially poorly. They are 
set forth chiefly in Ground Troops field manuals. But the 
specific nature of regulations does not permit showing their 
development, substantiating conceptual propositions, or 
illustrating them with examples, proof and calculations, which 
is very important not only for understanding the nature of 
modern battle, but also for mastering the art of conducting it. 
  All this indicates that a need matured long ago for 
developing a fundamental military-theoretical work devoted to 
principles of combined arms battle. It should be said that this 
task was accomplished to a certain extent with the publication 
of V. Ya. Savkin's work "Osnovnyye printsipy operativnogo 
iskusstva i taktiki" [Basic Principles of Operational Art and 
Tactics] in 1972. It sets forth the views of very prominent 
field generals and theorists of the past rather fully on 
principles of military art, discloses the dialectical 
correlation of laws of warfare and principles of military art, 
and analyzes the mechanism of action of laws and forms of their 
practical use. But the content of the principles is not revealed 
fully enough: Factors determining their development are not 
shown. 
  Inasmuch as the study of principles of military art in the 
postwar period is limited to a certain time frame (1953-1959), 
the work naturally does not reflect those profound changes in 
military affairs which occurred over a little more than the last 
three decades. One also cannot help but note that the above work 
did not cover many principles of battle such as combat readiness 
of troops; the maneuver of subunits, strikes and fire; 
comprehensive support to battle; total exertion of moral and 
physical efforts; use of the moral-psychological factor in 
support of combat mission performance; and firm, continuous 
command and control. 
  Based on a study of the nature of modern combined arms 
battle, the goal of this work is to reveal the essence of its 
fundamental principles, show their role and importance in 
command and control activity of commanders and staffs, reveal 
the new things which have appeared in their content under the 
influence of scientific-technical progress in military affairs, 
identify trends in their further development, develop certain 
practical recommendations by which one should be guided in 
preparing for and in the course of conducting combat operations, 
and creatively put those principles into practice. This book is 
not an account of "recipes" for achieving success in battle 
(they do not exist in nature) and it is not a "catechism" of 
immutable truths (canons and dogmatic lines are alien to 
tactics). It is a reflection on tactical art, an attempt to 
penetrate into the commander's creative "laboratory" and show 
what he encounters in seeking uncommon decisions in battle, what 
contradictions and difficulties he overcomes and in what way. 
  The content of the work is aimed at shaping an officer's 
nonstandard tactical thinking, at rejecting banality and 
stereotyped approaches, at fighting routine and conventionalism 
and at reviving tactics as the genuine art of doing battle. 
Historical method and objectivity in analyzing phenomena of 
combat reality are the basis of the study. In examining 
principles of battle, their origin, and paths of formation and 
development, the author saw his task as showing not only the 
role of Soviet, but also of pre-revolutionary Russian 
military-theoretical thought and that of foreign military 
analysts. 
  For a long time we boasted that only Soviet military science 
had a monopoly on the truth, deliberately rejecting other 
military schools. This too is one of the sources of dogmatism. 
Enriched by the abundant experience of the Civil War and Great 
Patriotic War, Soviet military theory achieved progress in its 
development. We rightly are proud that our Armed Forces have 
grand combat traditions. But this does not at all mean that one 
must disdain the historical past or fail to notice positive 
things achieved in other armies. It is obvious that for the good 
of the cause one must be critical toward one's own opinions and 
not reject other opinions and foreign military experience out of 
hand. This will help get rid of dogmatism, embellishment and 
conventionalism faster and will help pave the way to new 
thinking in assessing military problems. 
  While having based the study of principles of combined arms 
battle on guidance documents, on combat training requirements of 
Minister of Defense orders and directives, and on requirements 
of field manuals in force, the author at the same time expresses 
his own viewpoint on a number of questions that differs from 
what is generally accepted and advances certain new propositions 
in the form of statements and discussion. The work makes no 
claim that coverage of this subject is indisputable or 
exhaustively complete.

<H3>  1. Origin and Development of Principles of Tactics and Their 
Interrelationship with Principles of Operational Art and Strategy </H3>
  There is not one social science which would not clothe the 
results of its research and generalizations of practice in 
specific rules--principles. Military science, military art and 
theory of tactics are no exception. They have their own 
fundamental categories here--laws, logical patterns, principles. 
And although command and control in the battle and operation 
will not accept rigid norms, although it is harmed by dogmatic 
blinders, this does not at all mean there are no rules here. 
There are, and they are reflected in principles of military art 
developed by many centuries of practice; as combat experience 
has shown, disregarding them inevitably leads to errors, 
miscalculations and even defeat. Conversely, knowing and 
skillfully embodying them in practical command and control 
activity ensures success. 
  Already in ancient times people realized that one cannot act 
at random in the battle and engagement without relying on 
accumulated experience and on recommendations developed by 
predecessors. Flavius Vegetius, a Roman thinker of the ancient 
world, aptly noted: "...Let whoever wishes victory diligently 
train the soldiers; let whoever wishes to obtain a favorable 
result wage war relying on art and knowledge, not on 
chance."[.sup]1[/] 
  The art of tactics and its guiding principles began forming 
long before military leaders began to view the engagement and 
battle as a natural process. Based on the experience gained 
(successful or unsuccessful) and its interpretation and with no 
contemplation of the fact that the rules developed reflect 
objective ties and relationships, precepts were developed on how 
to prepare the army for a campaign, how to dispose it on the 
battlefield, how to supply it with everything necessary and how 
to fight. It was assumed, for example, that if observing 
requirements for an uneven lateral distribution of forces and 
for concealment and coordination of their actions ensures 
success in battle, this means one must be guided by these 
requirements henceforth. Conversely, if a particular method of 
conducting combat operations led to failure, it was discarded as 
worthless. 
  Formation of the theory of tactics and its "main frame," the 
principles of battle, is a lengthy, complex process. Combat 
experience accumulated intuitively over many centuries by the 
trial-and-error method. Each time, failures were paid for in 
blood, and this forced military leaders and thinkers to ponder 
the way in which they should avoid miscalculations and how to 
organize for battle so as to suffer fewer costs and human 
losses. Rules approbated in the course of many battles were 
reflected in treatises, regulations and manuals and acquired the 
importance of mandatory guidelines. In organizing for the battle 
or engagement, military leaders did not begin developing new 
approaches each time but, relying on accumulated experience, 
structured the combat formation more skillfully, achieved 
concealment, speed and cohesiveness of operations, employed 
procedures of deception and so on. Basing themselves on 
predecessors' experience, talented field generals made their own 
contribution to developing methods of preparing and conducting 
battle. 
  In the period of the slaveholding socioeconomic formation, 
military theory managed to arrive at certain generalizations and 
conclusions approximating cognition of some of the most general 
laws of warfare. Principles of military art began to be 
formulated. This was reflected most fully in works by Chinese 
thinker and military leader Sun Tzu, the ancient Greek 
historians Thucydides and Xenophon, Roman military leader Julius 
Caesar, as well as Roman military historians Frontinus and 
Vegetius. If we take the work by Vegetius, "A Brief Exposition 
of Principles of Military Affairs," which was a model 
generalization of combat experience of armies in the 
slaveholding period, it reflected such principles of tactics as 
concentration of force against weakness, surprise ("surprise 
frightens an enemy and usually costs little"[.sup]2[/]), 
coordination and swiftness of operations. 
  No great progress in military affairs was achieved in the 
era 
of feudalism. The art of fighting a battle and war as a whole 
remained at a low level. But even in this period many works on 
strategy and tactics appeared which enriched military theory and 
facilitated development of principles of battle. Works by N. 
Machiavelli, Maurice of Orange and Gustavus Adolphus should be 
noted especially. Thus, in the "Treatise on Military Art," the 
Florentine Machiavelli substantiated the principle of 
historicity and logical patterns in development of military art. 
In tactics, he gave preference to the principle of aggressive, 
decisive actions. His recommendations on aligning combat 
formations, on establishing reserves and on questions of command 
and control and logistic support of troops were of great 
interest. 
  Maurice of Orange, a major military figure of the 
Netherlands, performed a big job in reorganizing the army, 
giving it features of a regular army, and introduced a new 
combat formation--he began employing a linear alignment instead 
of the square columns used in European armies. In practical 
command and control activity, he attached great significance to 
the principle of thorough support of combat operations and to 
the factor of morale. Principles of tactics, especially those 
such as centralization and firmness of command and control, 
massing of forces and flexibility of interworking, received a 
skillful interpretation in military activity of Swedish military 
leader Gustavus Adolphus. 
  Cromwell made a significant contribution to development of 
military art in the period of the British bourgeois revolution 
(1642-1649). His revolutionary army surpassed the King's troops 
in combat effectiveness, capability of accomplishing bold 
actions, precision and organization. 
  Principles of military art received fullest formalization in 
the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Of military theorists 
and field generals of this period who substantially contributed 
to the development of military affairs, one should note French 
Marshal Turenne, Austrian field general Eugene of Savoy, and 
General Montecuccoli. Their combat experience was studied and 
used as guidance by many field generals. In the work "Notes on 
War," General Montecuccoli set forth such principles of battle 
as purposefulness, the ability to commensurate one's forces 
("whoever intends to conquer the entire world in battle feeds on 
the winds and chases the wind"), swiftness and decisiveness of 
actions, surprise and maneuver. 
  Major military writers Fuller and Gibert devoted much 
attention to questions of development of tactics. In 
generalizing experience of wars, they compared it with the 
experience of wars of the ancient world and drew appropriate 
conclusions from this. Gibert's work "Experience of Tactics" 
played no small role in questions of development of principles 
of linear tactics. He favored high troop mobility and an 
improvement in the organization of infantry. Prussian King and 
military leader Frederick II substantially influenced 
development of strategy and tactics in the 18th century. As F. 
Engels wrote, he took linear tactics to perfection. One 
principle of his actions was the "oblique attack," the essence 
of which was a concentration of efforts against one of the enemy 
flanks. 
  A new stage in development of military affairs begun by 
bourgeois revolutions in Europe and mass employment of firearms 
was marked by military science being given an orderly system. 
Works by British military writer Henry Lloyd and German writer 
Heinrich Dietrich von Bulow played an important role in 
this. 
  In the work "Political and Military Memoirs" General Lloyd 
attempted to develop fundamentals of a general theory of war. He 
believed that military art was based on permanent principles, 
among which he included security of the line of operations and a 
five-march logistic system. To achieve success in an engagement, 
Lloyd wrote, do not split your forces, display swiftness and 
firmness, employ maneuver and strive for concealment. 
  Von Bulow's work "Spirit of the Newest System" 
theoretically generalized everything new that had been created 
in the era of revolution. For the first time he noted the 
significance of a mass army, analyzed the content of strategy 
and tactics and defined them. "Strategy," wrote von Bulow, 
"is the science of military movements outside of view or of the 
reach of a cannon shot, and tactics is the science of military 
movements within these limits."[.sup]3[/] Von Bulow 
developed several new theoretical concepts such as a base of 
operations, strategic deployment, the objective of war and so on. 
  New organizational forms which appeared in wars of the 
French 
Revolution were of great significance for development of 
military theory, particularly establishing the army corps, 
upgrading the structure of the division as the basic tactical 
combat unit, and improving the organization of artillery, which 
in some engagements was massed in large groups numbering 
hundreds of pieces. A cavalry was established capable of 
conducting various combat operations and of swift assault in 
tight formation. The logistic support system was improved, which 
helped increase the army's mobility. 
  The new army advanced new methods of combat operations, 
which 
received the most striking manifestation in Napoleon's strategy 
and tactics. Decisiveness of goals, an attempt to defeat the 
enemy army at one crushing blow, swiftness of actions, 
simplicity of maneuver, the ability to achieve surprise, and 
delivery of an attack with massive concentrated attack 
forces--those were the most typical features and principles of 
his military art, which had an enormous influence on subsequent 
development of military theory and practice. For an entire 
century military theorists were captives of Napoleonic strategy 
and tactics. 
  A major event in military life was the appearance in 1813 of 
a capital work by Austrian field general Archduke Karl of 
Austria "Principles of Strategy Illustrated by An Account of the 
Campaign of 1796 in Germany." It formulated rather precisely 
such principles of strategy and tactics as concentrating a 
numerical superiority of forces and employing them on the 
decisive axis, properly calculating personnel and equipment, 
skillfully choosing the moment for delivering an attack, winning 
time, and establishing strong reserves. But it should be said 
that Archduke Karl was one of the forefathers of the theory of 
eternal and immutable principles of war. He feared risk and went 
down in history as the "circumspect" field general. 
  The formation and development of principles of military art 
are linked closely with names of the most prominent military 
theorists of the latter half of the 19th century H. Jomini and 
C. von Clausewitz. Jomini believed that military art must have 
its scientific theory based on recognition of a number of 
immutable principles, which in his opinion existed since 
earliest times and were manifested in the activity of great 
field generals. He included the following among the most 
important principles of military art: Aggressiveness; proper 
choice of strategic points ("keys"); skillful maneuvering to 
move onto internal enemy lines of operations; economy of forces 
in secondary sectors and decisive direction of one's efforts 
against one of the vulnerable points; and establishment of 
strategic reserves. 
  Outstanding military philosopher von Clausewitz created the 
famous work "On War," which reflected a general theory of 
warfare. Von Clausewitz also played a major role in systemizing 
principles of military art. He included numerical strength, 
concentration of forces and surprise among the most general 
principles. Von Clausewitz took the point of view of conducting 
decisive, aggressive combat operations. He recognized the 
general engagement and crushing of enemy personnel to be an 
important means of achieving the goals of war. Von Clausewitz 
attached great importance to purposefulness of actions, the 
material factor and the factor of morale. 
  While giving due respect in the formation and development of 
principles of strategy and tactics to prominent military figures 
and military writers who laid the foundations of military 
science, at the same time it should be noted that combat 
practice directly played an enormous role in shaping principles 
of military art. It served as a criterion of effectiveness of 
developed standards, rules and precepts. War mercilessly cast 
aside everything far-fetched and artificial, affirmed what had 
been tested, and cleared the way for what was vital and 
necessary. Various hypotheses and theories were born and died in 
the flame of battles, but there was an invariable process of 
forward movement, and tactics, operational art and strategy were 
enriched and developed. 
  The permanent value of principles of battle reflected in 
military works, manuals and regulations is that they serve as a 
unique bridge between past and present. The path to the future 
lies through them. By understanding them, the military leader 
receives the experience of preceding generations and moves 
further and reaches new stages of combat perfection based on 
lessons of the past. 
  The 20th century went down in history as a century of 
machines and motors. New machines and new equipment were 
intensively introduced not only to production, but also to 
military affairs. The appearance of new weapons necessitated a 
search for new strategic and tactical concepts, which gave 
powerful impetus to the study of war and development of 
principles of military art. A large number of 
military-theoretical works were published not long before World 
War I, among them works by German military writers von der Holtz 
"An Armed People," Schlichting "Principles of Modern Military 
Tactics and Strategy," A. von Schliffen "Cannae," Bernhardi "On 
War of Today," major French military figure and military 
theorist F. Foch "On Principles of War" and "On Waging War," 
military writer Levalle "Introduction to the Positive Part of 
Strategy," "March Strategy" and "Battle Strategy," American 
Admiral A. Mahan "The Influence of Sea Power Upon History," and 
British Admiral P. Colomb, "Naval Warfare, Its Basic Principles 
and Experience." 
  World War I was a stern test of military-theoretical 
concepts. Many prewar concepts did not stand up to the tests and 
were rejected by combat practice as impracticable. At the same 
time, the experience of war and the new phenomena of warfare 
which arose in its course served as the basis for further 
development of principles of strategy, operational art and 
tactics. Thus, the theories of "blitzkrieg," "tank" and "air" 
war, and "small professional armies" appeared following World 
War I. The theory of the deep operation originated in Soviet 
military science and saw some development. As a result of this, 
all component parts of military art took a new step in their 
development. 
  World War II influenced the content of strategy, operational 
art and tactics even more than World War I. With respect to 
principles of tactics, their development in the course of this 
war as well as in contemporary local wars will be examined in 
more detail in appropriate chapters of the work. 
  Russia's military-theoretical thought made a ponderable 
contribution to the depository of world military art and to 
development and enrichment of its principles. There is no need 
here to anticipate the further presentation of material; we will 
note only that sources of Russian military art take their 
beginning from ancient times. It took shape and developed 
largely on an independent, distinctive path and therefore has 
many specific features. The successful campaign of Kievan 
princes Oleg and Svyatoslav and subsequently the military 
leadership activity of Aleksandr Nevskiy, Dmitriy Donskoy and 
Ivan the Terrible can serve as a vivid example of how high the 
level of development of military art was in Ancient Rus. 
  The "Poucheniya" [Precepts] of Vladimir Monomakh, which set 
forth important rules (principles) of attaining success in 
campaigns and recommendations on ensuring surprise, making 
marches, and methods of conducting an offensive, was one of the 
early ancient Russian military-theoretical works. 
  Military-theoretical thought developed especially rapidly 
under Peter I and Catherine II. A. V. Suvorov called Peter the 
Great the first field general of his century. The Northern War 
and later the Seven Years' War were a major school for Russian 
military art. The beginning of an independent national Russian 
military school was laid down under Peter the Great; its 
continuers were Russian field generals and naval leaders P. A. 
Rumyantsev, A. V. Suvorov, M. I. Kutuzov and F. F. Ushakov. They 
introduced much that was new to strategy and tactics and they 
glorified and brought fame to Russian military art. 
  The Russian army and navy won numerous victories over armies 
of Frederick II and Napoleon, and also over Turkish troops. The 
Patriotic War of 1812-1814 showed that the Russian Army was the 
bearer of the most advanced military experience. 
  Russian military heritage still needs to be revealed. The 
role of Catherine the Great in glorifying Russia, including in 
developing military affairs, was undeservedly minimized. In 
paying due respect to Western European military figures who did 
a great deal for the formation of military science, due respect 
also must be paid to military-theoretical works of Russian 
military writers. Principles of military theory were developed 
in works by I. G. Burtsov "Mysli o teorii voyennykh znaniy" 
[Thoughts on the Theory of Military Knowledge], N. V. Medem 
"Obozreniye izvestneyshikh pravil i sistem strategii" [Survey of 
the Most Well-Known Rules and Systems of Strategy], P. Ya. 
Yazykov "Opyt teorii strategii" [Experience of the Theory of 
Strategy], M. I. Bogdanovich "Zapiski strategii" [Notes of 
Strategy] and N. D. Neyelov "Ocherk sovremennogo sostoyaniya 
strategii" [Essay on the Present State of Strategy]. Principles 
of military art were formulated especially fully and precisely 
in works by N. P. Mikhnevich "Strategiya" [Strategy], A. G. 
Yelchaninov "Vedeniye sovremennykh voyn i boya" [Conduct of 
Modern Wars and Battle], V. A. Cheremisov "Osnovy sovremennogo 
voyennogo iskusstva" [Fundamentals of Modern Military Art], A. 
A. Neznamov "Sovremennaya voyna" [Modern War], and G. A. Leyer 
"Strategiya" [Strategy] as well as in works by a number of other 
Russian military scholars--D. A. Milyutin, A. K. Puzyrevskiy, D. 
F. Maslovskiy, A. Z. Myshloyevskiy, M. I. Dragomirov, S. O. 
Makarov, A. A. Gulevich, V. F. Novitskiy and others. 
  Publication of the Russian "Voyennaya entsiklopediya" 
[Military Encyclopedia] (1911-1915) substantially contributed to 
the formation and systemization of principles of military art. 
It established four principles of military art: Superiority of 
forces; significance of the spiritual element in war; 
significance of chance happenings, and surprise. It was 
emphasized that superiority of forces is the basis of 
victory.[.sup]4[/] 
  It is apparent from the brief historical sketch that the 
theory of military art underwent a complex evolution over many 
centuries of history. Its study and profound understanding 
permit identifying stable logical patterns which determined the 
origin and formation of principles of military art and tactics. 
  The methodological importance of principles of military art 
was that they served and serve as the pivotal basis of all its 
component parts--strategy, operational art and tactics--and they 
determine unity of views of military cadres on fundamental 
provisions of preparing and conducting combat operations. And 
inasmuch as tactics is an integrally indissoluble component of 
military art, the formation of its principles can be understood 
only by having precisely understood the mutual relationship of 
tactics with strategy and with operational art. Let us dwell on 
this in more detail. 
  The role and place of tactics and its principles in 
evolution 
of military art were determined by the significance of the 
battle in the system of warfare. It is known that for many 
centuries the battle played the deciding role in the course and 
outcome of war and in accomplishing missions of strategy. 
Principles of preparing and conducting combat operations have 
originated and taken shape in the depths of tactics and then 
have been accepted by strategy from time immemorial. This was 
dictated by many objective reasons: First of all, by the fact 
that for many centuries means of warfare were insufficiently 
perfect and all without exception were concentrated in the 
tactical sphere; secondly, armies were relatively small and the 
material base supplying the war was poorly developed. Under such 
conditions military operations usually developed into a brief 
clash culminating in a general engagement. For a long time the 
concept of "battle" was identical to the concept of "military 
operations." Thus, the "Entsiklopediya voyennykh i morskikh 
nauk" [Encyclopedia of Military and Naval Sciences] published in 
1883 gives the following definition of battle: "The battle is a 
general concept," "a battle [boy] of two armies which decided 
the fate of the war or of a separate operation . . . is called a 
general engagement or battle [bitva]," "a battle [boy] of two 
armies of a less definite nature than in the previous case which 
decided neither the fate of the war nor even of a separate 
operation, but which led to a more or less substantial change in 
the situation for both sides in the theater of military 
operations . . . is called an engagement [srazheniye]. . . . A 
clash of independent parts of two armies--corps, divisions--is 
called a battle [boy]."[.sup]5[/] 
  With the origin of operations as a new form of warfare there 
appeared a new intermediate link between strategy and 
tactics--operational art, which initially was still not 
officially recognized by military theory. The battle no longer 
acted as the chief means of achieving the goals of war, but only 
as one of its forms, the operation. One local battle, no matter 
how important it might be, and even one major engagement where 
the sides had several armies, no longer decisively affected the 
general course of military operations. The path of war from its 
beginning to its conclusion began running through many, many 
successful and unsuccessful offensive and defensive battles and 
engagements, which were combined into army and then also into 
front operations (operations of a group of armies), and the 
latter into military campaigns that were lengthy in time. 
  With the appearance of operational art as an independent 
component of military art, the need arose for military theory to 
identify the new interrelationship among principles of strategy, 
operational art and tactics. Traditional interworking between 
strategy and tactics was disrupted under the existing 
conditions. Tactics no longer exerted a direct effect, but an 
indirect effect on strategy through operational art. Only a 
multitude of tactical operations in the aggregate, summed up, 
produced an operational result and through the operation 
determined the content of war and its successful or unsuccessful 
outcome. Under the influence of this the internal 
interrelationship among principles of component parts of 
military art became more complicated and the influence of 
requirements of operational art and strategy on the content of 
principles of battle intensified. 
  The role of battle as the basis and chief means of achieving 
the goals of an operation and war was preserved until the 
strategic and operational command element had at their disposal 
their own personnel and equipment which were not part of 
combined arms formations and units. This process began with the 
appearance of aviation in the course of World War I and 
continued after its conclusion, but it was developed with 
special force in World War II. In addition to long-range 
(strategic) aviation, the strategic (operational) leadership at 
that time had airborne troops; air defense troops; powerful, 
highly mobile tank and mechanized large strategic formations; 
and Supreme High Command Reserve artillery formations. These 
personnel and equipment were employed in operations not only for 
reinforcing operational and tactical groupings, but also for 
performing certain independent missions. 
  But even under these conditions the decisive importance in 
achieving operational and strategic results still remained with 
tactics. Tactical actions continued to hold the principal place 
in the system of operations. This was dictated by the fact that 
immediate defeat of the enemy could be achieved only by battle, 
and the majority of personnel and means of warfare continued to 
be at the tactical level. The supreme and operational command 
elements were purposefully in charge of tactical forces and 
assets and created favorable conditions for their employment: in 
preparing and carrying out the operation, they specified 
objectives and missions for formations and units, organized 
interworking among them within the scope of the operation, gave 
them combat and logistic support, and coordinated combat 
operations. 
  But already at that time their own specific principles 
inherent only to these echelons had appeared within the 
framework of operational art and strategy, such as attaining 
simultaneous deep engagement of the enemy. True, in World War II 
this principle was incompletely implemented in practice. The 
problem was that artillery, which basically was at the tactical 
level and whose range capabilities were limited, accomplished 
the primary mission of suppressing the enemy. Although the share 
of participation of operational and strategic assets in 
defeating the enemy increased considerably, it did not become 
decisive. The goal of the operation was achieved in the final 
account by joint operations of formations and units on the 
battlefield, and beyond the battlefield by air strikes delivered 
against the enemy at a varying depth by aviation forces, by 
commitment of mobile groups of fronts and armies both in the 
tactical as well as operational zones of enemy defense, and also 
by the landing of airborne and amphibious assault forces in the 
defenders' rear. General success in such operations was the 
result of efforts both of tactical as well as operational and 
strategic assets, but the latter's proportion in the war 
remained relatively low because of their insufficiently high 
combat effectiveness. The main enemy forces were "pulverized" 
chiefly on the battlefield, in the tactical zone. The battle 
continued to hold a central place in war. Not one engagement, 
not one operation was conceivable without it. 
  The "disposition of forces" in military art became 
qualitatively different with the appearance of nuclear weapons. 
New interrelationships among strategy, operational art and 
tactics took shape under their influence, manifested in the fact 
that the strategic echelon occupied the predominant role in 
accomplishing missions of war, inasmuch as the most powerful 
weapons were concentrated under its command. Therefore the 
question naturally arises as to what role tactics should play in 
operations under these conditions. 
  It should be said that the development of new approaches to 
forming principles of military art did not go smoothly under the 
new conditions. Both foreign as well as Soviet military 
literature expressed many different viewpoints on prospects of 
development of military art and especially tactics. For example, 
the work "Voyennaya strategiya" [Military Strategy], published 
in 1962 under the editorship of V. D. Sokolovskiy, stated that 
under the new conditions the interrelationship of strategy, 
operational art and tactics should be assessed in a 
fundamentally different way. The authors wrote that the time had 
passed when "it was considered an indisputable fact that a 
general victory in war takes shape from numerous local 
successes. . . . Modern strategic weapons . . . immediately 
subordinate to high commands and permitting achievement of 
decisive results in winning victory in war, often even without 
the involvement of personnel and equipment of the tactical and 
operational level, speak in favor of the thesis that local 
successes now can be determined by successes of a general 
strategic nature."[.sup]6[/] The inference naturally stemmed 
from such a conclusion that the role of tactics essentially is 
becoming secondary under the new conditions. 
  But such views formed under the influence of "nuclear 
euphoria" characteristics of the 1960's, when it was 
unequivocally believed that a future world war certainly would 
be a nuclear war. In the 1970's Soviet military doctrine began 
to take account of the possibility of the outbreak both of a 
nuclear as well as a conventional world war. Accordingly, the 
interrelationship of component parts of military art and the 
role of tactics were presented in a new light. The new concept 
was reflected in the fullest form in the book by A. A. Grechko 
"Vooruzhennyye sily Sovetskogo gosudarstva" [Armed Forces of the 
Soviet State], published in 1975. Speaking of the importance of 
tactics, the author wrote: "Regardless of the means by which war 
is waged, tactics remains the base for achieving operational and 
strategic successes." And even: "It begins . . . specifically . 
. . with tactics, it is accomplished by tactics, and the 
implementation of operational and strategic concepts is 
completed by tactics."[.sup]7[/] 
  In recent years judicious state figures have been conducting 
intensified searches for those military-strategic concepts which 
would provide an opportunity to achieve political goals without 
the danger of outbreak of a general nuclear war threatening 
disastrous consequences for mankind. Today's impressions of a 
possible war differ from past ones by the fact that ever greater 
preference is given to military operations with conventional 
weapons. But inasmuch as the probability of conduct of different 
kinds of war, both a world conventional war as well as a world 
nuclear war, is preserved even now, the armed forces of the 
majority of countries are forced to master methods of combat 
operations with and without the use of nuclear weapons. These 
requirements then are made the basis for development of tactical 
principles. 
  An orderly system of principles of combined arms battle 
encompassing all aspects of its preparation and conduct has 
taken shape in our military art at the present time. The 
following are among the most important of them: constant combat 
readiness of subunits; decisiveness, aggressiveness and 
continuity in fighting a battle; coordinated employment of 
subunits of combat arms and special troops and maintenance of 
continuous interworking among them; surprise of operations and 
the use of stratagem (deceiving the enemy); decisive 
concentration of efforts on the main axis and at the decisive 
moment; maneuver of subunits, strikes and fire; timely 
restoration of subunits' combat effectiveness and comprehensive 
support of battle; full exertion of moral and physical forces 
and use of the moral-psychological factor to perform the combat 
mission; and firm, continuous command and control of 
subunits.[.sup]8[/] 
  Speaking of general principles of combined arms battle, one 
should note their interrelationship with particular principles 
which are the basis of combat employment of formations, units 
and subunits of combat arms and special troops. The latter form 
under the determining influence of principles of general 
tactics. At the same time, specifics of combat employment of 
each combat arm (or special troops) are reflected in their 
content. Particular principles of combat arms exert a specific 
effect on the content of principles of combined arms battle. 
  The content both of general as well as particular principles 
reflects the level of development tactics has achieved. Their 
strength and vitality lies in the fact that they do not rely on 
secondary, insignificant, transient circumstances but reflect 
deep processes of combat operations, stable interrelationships 
and objective logical patterns, cognition of which serves as a 
unique reference point for the commander; by adhering to it he 
finds the true path to achieving the goal set in the battle. 
  Principles of military art are reflected in one form or 
another in field service regulations (field manuals, other 
manuals, and guides of all world armies). The U.S. 
Army attaches great significance to them. The U.S. Field 
Service Regulations point out that principles are the foundation 
of the truth about war, and sensible use of them ensures victory 
over the enemy. According to U.S. Army Field Manual FM 100 
(1982), principles of military art are systemized in the 
following order: general principles of war are formulated, and 
principles of the air-land operation (battle) as well as 
principles relating to kinds of combat operations are formulated 
within their framework. The following are among principles of 
war for the Army: Purposefulness; the offensive; massing of 
personnel and equipment; economy of personnel and equipment; 
mobility; unity of command and control; security; surprise; 
simplicity. 
  The principles of battle are subdivided by kinds into 
offensive and defensive. The following are considered principles 
of offensive operations: concentration of personnel and 
equipment; surprise; swiftness; flexibility and decisiveness. 
Concentration of forces is considered an integral part of the 
offensive. 
  The idea of depriving an attacking enemy of advantages and 
quickly seizing the initiative is made the basis of principles 
of defensive operations. Principle No 1 is worded as follows: 
Seize the tactical initiative in individual sectors, and then 
also the general initiative as the transition is made from 
defense to offensive. Principle No 2 states: deliver attacks to 
the full depth of enemy combat formations, which will permit 
delaying and disorganizing him and also creating conditions for 
launching an offensive. A defense in depth gives an opportunity 
to win time and space for executing a swift, flexible maneuver. 
Principle No 3 requires: Dictate conditions of battle to the 
enemy and maintain swiftness and flexibility of fire, maneuver, 
and employment of EW assets. Principle No 4 requires: Coordinate 
operations of all personnel and equipment at your disposal in 
the course of battle and take advantage of the slightest enemy 
weaknesses to stop his offensive. 
  FRG Bundeswehr field manuals usually enumerate the 
following principles of combat operations: Seizure of the 
initiative and activeness; aggressiveness; concentration of 
personnel and equipment at the decisive place and at a favorable 
time; massing of fire in a decisive sector and execution of a 
bold maneuver; interworking; surprise; decisiveness of 
operations, persistence and display of initiative; 
strong-willed, constant, precise command and control; and 
uninterrupted combat and logistic support. 
  Field manuals of the British Army consider the 
most important principles of battle to be the following: Choice 
and approval of the objective; offensive combat operations; 
interworking; freedom of actions; concentration of forces; 
economy of forces; surprise; indirect actions (deceptive 
procedures); combat support of troops; maintenance of healthy 
morale; and command and control of troops and the rear. 
  It is apparent that principles of battle are understood 
differently in different armies depending on traditions which 
have formed, the level of development of military art, depth of 
cognition of logical patterns of warfare, and their 
philosophical interpretation. Nevertheless, one cannot help but 
note that in its essence the wording of the majority of 
principles has a logical similarity. Their important role in 
military art is assessed to a like degree in all armies. 
Speaking of the content of principles of battle, military 
theorists and practitioners always emphasize simplicity and 
accessibility of their understanding. As von Clausewitz wrote, 
"principles of military art in themselves are to the highest 
degree simple and in full accord with common sense."[.sup]9[/] 
<H3>  2. Guiding Lights in the Commander's Control Activity in 
Battle </H3>
  The principles of battle have dual significance for military 
theory and practice. On the one hand, they are the basis for 
systemization of scientific knowledge and logical construction 
of the theory of tactics, reflecting its corresponding level of 
development. On the other hand, they are guiding lights, guiding 
recommendations, by which the commander finds the true path to 
achieving the assigned objective in a difficult combat 
situation. Figuratively speaking, they are the reference points 
of victory. In this section we will speak of the importance of 
principles in command and control. 
  To begin with let us pose the following question: Is it 
possible to exercise command and control of subunits and achieve 
success in battle without knowing the principles of military 
art? We will answer as follows: Generally such a case is not 
precluded under certain particular simplified conditions. If we 
refer to Great Patriotic War experience, then of course not all 
commanders at the tactical level had high erudition and were 
sufficiently trained theoretically in order to deliberately 
apply appropriate principles in practical activity. It can be 
said that many mastered the difficult science of winning 
intuitively, based on practical experience they gained and a 
knowledge of the provisions of regulations. 
  An officer who does not know the principles of military art 
but who prepares for battle can be compared with a wayfarer who, 
being in open country or a dense forest with neither map nor 
compass, tries to find the road to the necessary point. It is 
quite obvious that he will have to wander a great deal. But 
while this will cost the wayfarer loss of time and effort, it 
will cost a commander loss of people and possibly also loss of 
the battle. In order for this not to happen it is necessary to 
"arm" oneself ahead of time both theoretically and practically: 
Learn the nature of modern battle well, know its principles, and 
learn to apply them skillfully in practice. Like invisible 
"advisers," at a difficult moment they will suggest to him how 
to act, how to find the way out of a difficult situation, how 
not to be taken in, and how to avoid mistakes and 
miscalculations. These "advisers" have the wisdom of experience 
of many, many generations behind them and they can be fully 
trusted. 
  Thus it is a question of scientific command and control, of 
that command and control which relies on a knowledge of laws and 
logical patterns of warfare, from which principles of military 
art logically stem. Delving into the mechanism of action of 
these laws permits finding the most effective methods and 
procedures of exerting an effect in the necessary direction on 
the conditions under which laws arise and function and finding 
maximum opportunities in the situation at hand for making and 
implementing faultless decisions. 
  Laws are an objective category. They act independently of a 
person's will and desire, independently of whether or not a 
commander needs this or whether he likes or does not like the 
effect of the laws. He cannot choose particular laws, but must 
reckon with them. Conversely, principles based on the laws are 
applied consciously by man depending on specific situation 
conditions. They contain recommendations about what must be done 
to achieve victory and how one must act. Principles successfully 
combine both the necessary nature of effect of laws of war and 
the relative freedom of people's conscious activity within the 
framework of this necessity. 
  The wording of principles reflects not only requirements of 
laws, but also those goals and missions to which military 
activity is subordinated. Prominent Civil War military leader S. 
I. Gusev said it well about the interrelationship of laws of war 
and principles of military art: "That which is a law in 
consideration' becomes a rule in action. What is a law in 
science is a rule in art."[.sup]10[/] 
  A knowledge of the nature of battle and its objective laws 
and logical patterns permits a commander to gain a deep 
understanding of the meaning of events occurring, correctly get 
his bearings and estimate that situation in which battle is 
prepared and waged. And on this largely depends the advisability 
of the decision made and of all the commander's actions in 
command and control. But it would be erroneous to take this 
proposition to mean that in studying specific conditions of 
battle a commander must not fail to find the logical patterns in 
them in order to reinforce their beneficial influence or reduce 
their harmful influence. The operation, the battle and their 
processes are infinite in their specific manifestations, 
properties and relationships. Thorough cognition of their nature 
and discovery of logical patterns are impossible based on a 
single particular instance. This is achieved in the course of 
generalizing many battles under the most diverse situation 
conditions, which is within the capability only of military 
theory. In analyzing combat experience, its task specifically is 
to discard everything random and superficial, find what is an 
often repeated logical pattern, and on this basis develop 
recommendations, rules and principles suitable for practical 
command and control activity. 
  The value of principles of military art is that a 
dialectical 
unity of the objective and subjective in an officer's command 
and control activity is achieved through them. They serve as a 
connecting link between theory and practice and translate the 
content of theoretical provisions of military science into the 
language of military practice. 
  Principles make it incumbent not only to realistically 
estimate the situation at hand, but also to alter it in 
necessary directions by carrying out necessary measures, 
creating favorable conditions for friendly troop operations and 
hampering enemy operations. In themselves, principles are 
passive and do not bring success. They are principles of victory 
and defeat to an equal extent. Everything depends on how 
skillfully or, conversely, how unskillfully a particular side 
uses the demands stemming from them in practice. 
  A knowledge of the principles facilitates the work of a 
commander who is organizing for battle and exercising command 
and control of it. A profound understanding of the complex 
system of interrelationship of laws and logical patterns of 
combat operations and the principles stemming therefrom is a 
reliable precondition for scientific foresight in military 
affairs and enables predicting both the primary trends in 
development of events as well as specific results of particular 
command and control measures. In short, principles serve as the 
basis of officers' combat proficiency. 
  It stands to reason that cognition of principles in itself 
leads to nothing without an ability to apply them in a specific 
situation. While being good reference points, principles cannot 
provide an answer on how to act in the situation at hand. 
Principles are only the "canvas," a starting point for 
decisionmaking, not the decision itself. They point out the 
general direction of an officer's practical activity, but do not 
reveal specific ways of achieving the objective set in battle. 
  Principles embody theoretical aims and their strength lies 
only in unity with practice. A. A. Neznamov noted: "Theory 
cannot set as a goal to point out the best method of actions in 
all instances. The situation in war is so diverse and, moreover, 
changes so swiftly that attempts to ascertain similar methods 
suitable everywhere and always are doomed in advance to 
failure."[.sup]11[/] G. A. Leyer wrote with respect to 
principles: "A principle indicates only the goal, 
which is why it is only a regulator of creativeness, 
the force directing it onto the path of correct decisions, but 
it hardly is a substitute for it."[.sup]12[/] 
  It is a far cry from a knowledge of principles to the 
skillful realization of their requirements, and this distance is 
not covered simply. Let us refer to Great Patriotic War 
experience. All of our Army's field manuals and field service 
regulations emphasized the importance of skillful interworking, 
command and control, massing of forces on decisive axes, and 
combat and logistic support, and the majority of our regular 
commanders theoretically mastered these provisions. 
Nevertheless, it was necessary to go through enormous military 
ordeals and fight hundreds and thousands of battles before 
officers learned to realize in practice the demands of 
principles of military art, which were simple in themselves, in 
preparing and conducting combat operations. 
  The fact is that a combat situation is extremely changeable, 
multiform and contradictory. In it the essential always is fused 
with the inessential, the natural and logical with the random, 
the old with the new. While in other kinds of activity man 
himself often is free to create circumstances favoring 
accomplishment of the assigned mission, in battle it is possible 
to ensure conditions for achieving success each time only by 
overcoming enemy resistance, i.e., across many, many obstacles. 
  Outwardly the battle is a battle of strength, a contest of 
the sides in firepower, swiftness of maneuver, speed in 
delivering strikes and abilities to defend. But behind these 
superficial manifestations hides a stubborn confrontation of 
intellect, of commanders' minds, a contest of the personnel's 
combat proficiency, commensuration of their moral-psychological 
staunchness, physical endurance and skill. With all other 
conditions being equal, the officer who is able to make 
effective use of favorable factors and to neutralize and nullify 
negative ones has more chances for success. 
  Exercising command and control in conformity with principles 
of military art means, first of all, commensurating the troops' 
goals and missions with the situation at hand, with their combat 
capabilities; secondly, not allowing subjectivism and an 
underestimation or overestimation of the enemy and friendly 
troops; thirdly, planning the battle and organizing interworking 
and its comprehensive support not blindly, but based on in-depth 
forecasting, calculations and foresight; fourthly, relying on 
objective conditions and a knowledge of the nature of battle and 
trends in its development. 
  The enumerated requirements are realized not mechanically, 
but creatively, in strict conformity with the situation. The 
commander cannot help but reckon with the fact that the desired 
goals far from always can correspond to troops' existing combat 
capabilities. The true reality of the state of affairs often can 
differ completely from the situation data received. Only an 
officer who does not think in a stereotyped manner, who is a 
bold innovator, a seeker, and a strong-willed organizer can 
successfully overcome these and many other difficulties and 
contradictions, make the optimum decision and achieve its 
realization. 
  This is especially important now. Never before have military 
affairs developed with such intensity as now, and this opens up 
a broad expanse for officers' creative searches both in theory 
of tactics as well as in practical command and control activity, 
in decisionmaking, and in innovative application of principles 
of battle. The fact is that at the present stage rates of 
renewal of the troops' material-technical base have accelerated 
extraordinarily. And inasmuch as tactics as the most dynamic 
sphere of military art directly reflects processes of change in 
weapons and combat equipment, officers are faced with the task 
of comprehending new phenomena occurring in military affairs 
with maximum mobility and coming up with necessary 
recommendations for the troops' practical assimilation of the 
most effective methods of preparing and conducting battle 
meeting a higher level of development of means of warfare. 
  Such a task is not new. The need to develop tactics 
creatively arose for military cadres in the past. It is known 
that in the postwar period two qualitative leaps in upgrading 
arms occurred in the Soviet Armed Forces and each time it 
demanded that the theory of tactics substantially revise views 
that had formed on the nature of combined arms battle and on the 
content of its fundamental principles. The first such leap 
occurred in the 1950's in connection with nuclear weapons 
becoming operational with the troops, which as noted above gave 
rise to a genuine revolution in military affairs. And in the 
altered conditions our generals and officers managed to work out 
fully and comprehensively the methods for troops to perform 
combat missions in the offensive and defense and effective 
methods of aligning combat formations of formations and units, 
fire damage of the enemy, and organization and accomplishment of 
interworking, command and control, and comprehensive support to 
battle. In the final account, all this was reflected in the 
content of principles of combined arms battle. 
  Many new missions arose for tactics during the 1960's and 
1970's in connection with introduction of missile weapons to the 
troops, which marked the second qualitative leap in development 
of means of warfare and military affairs as a whole. The 
increased power, depth and quick-acting nature of weapons in 
combination with increased troop mobility gave combined arms 
battle an even greater decisiveness and dynamic nature and 
increased its spatial scope. Under the altered conditions, our 
military cadres had to work out tactics of modern battle on a 
more contemporary material-technical basis, rethink the 
principles of its preparation and conduct, and bring their 
content into line with the increased requirements of operational 
art and strategy. 
  At the present time a third qualitative leap is occurring in 
development of military equipment within the framework of the 
continuing revolution in military affairs. It was caused not 
only by a further upgrading of nuclear weapons, but also by the 
intensive development of deep-strike, precision, automated 
weapon systems and by the ever increasing introduction to the 
Ground Troops of aircraft, diverse EW equipment and equipment 
for automating command and control of troops and weapons. 
  Another important feature of the present stage in 
development 
of combined arms battle is that substantial changes occurred in 
operating tactics of foreign armies. In the early 1980's, the 
U.S. Army adopted a fundamentally new "air-land operation" 
(battle) concept and armies of its Western European allies 
adopted a variety of it, the "follow-on forces attack." 
According to these concepts, as noted in the field service 
regulations of these armies, the success of combat operations is 
made dependent on observance of four fundamental principles: 
Initiative, depth, speed and coordination of efforts. 
  It is emphasized that the principle of initiative requires 
preempting the enemy in order to disorganize his troops and 
alter the correlation of personnel and equipment in one's own 
favor. The essence of the principle of depth is to 
comprehensively strive to increase rates of advance and spatial 
scope of combat operations. 
  It is believed that success of offensive and defensive 
operations depends to a decisive extent on timely, reliable 
engagement of the enemy to the full depth of his combat 
alignment. The goal of deep interdiction in the offensive, note 
the regulations, is to isolate the combat operations area, 
disrupt the defender's maneuver, reduce the mobility of his 
actions, not allow a regrouping of personnel and equipment to 
restore defense integrity, prevent the approach of reserves and 
cut them off from the main body. The following are the primary 
missions of deep fire interdiction in the defense: Splitting and 
disorganizing the attacker's combat formations, destroying enemy 
weapons, command and control facilities and communications 
centers, and covering an ongoing maneuver of personnel and 
equipment. 
  The principle of speed envisages flexibility in the 
organization of troops and promptness in the thinking of 
commanders who are capable of preempting the enemy in operations 
and immediately countering him with measures which may lead to 
disruption of his plans. 
  The principle of coordination of efforts is understood to 
mean complete unification of efforts of all troops involved in 
the battle and also of weapons--nuclear, chemical and 
conventional--to achieve maximum combat power and most effective 
use of combat capabilities of troops as a whole and of each unit 
separately. 
  Profound, cardinal changes in views on the nature of battle 
both in our own Army as well as in foreign armies elevates the 
role of commanders' tactical art. Creative searches for new 
solutions in methods of preparing and conducting combat 
operations, the development and enrichment of principles of 
military art, and foresight of prospects for development of 
tactics now are especially important. The entire system for 
training and educating military cadres must be directed forward. 
  Referring to history, it can be noted that the most 
prevalent 
mistake of many armies was that they often prepared "for the 
past war," if it can be thus expressed. That is, they could not 
determine the outlines of future operations and battles 
accurately enough and, out of inertia, continued to master those 
principles of combat operations which already had become 
obsolete long ago. At one time A. A. Svechin, editor of 
"Strategiya v trudakh voyennykh klassikov " [Strategy in Works 
of Military Classics], speaking of the work by French military 
theorist Foch "On Principles of War," correctly noted that "it 
contains the present military system, but one that has proven to 
be not at all in conformity with that reality which world war 
unfolded."[.sup]13[/] It must be said that a multitude of 
major mistakes and miscalculations were made at all 
levels--strategic, operational and tactical--both on the eve of 
World War I as well as of World War II. 
  It cannot be said that our Army and its military cadres 
presently have shifted completely to the new training system and 
have rid themselves of the burden of attributes of stagnant 
times in combat training. Proof of this is that at times in the 
course of conducting tactical exercises an oversimplified 
ground-air and electronic situation is created, deep targets 
remain outside the enemy's fire effect, a certain methodism and 
linear movement of troops from line to line is displayed in the 
dynamics of battle, head-on attacks are delivered, and a rather 
lengthy, passive confrontation of the sides is allowed in the 
process of combat operations. This clearly does not facilitate 
development of officers' active creative search, does not 
mobilize them for a struggle against a strong enemy, and does 
not contribute to instilling the necessary organizing and 
volitional qualities. This is why many young officers are very 
timid in tackling the independent rehearsal of difficult 
tactical missions and often act by direction. 
  We now need a decisive turning point in officers' creative 
thinking and clear realization of the fact that it is impossible 
to accomplish new missions in combat training by old methods. 
Although the wording of the absolute majority of principles of 
combined arms battle has not undergone changes in recent times 
despite the revolutionary renewal of tactics, their internal 
content and, most important, ways and methods of practical 
realization cannot remain the same. There is nothing now more 
pernicious in combat training than acting in the old way 
according to canons laid down at one time. 
  Profound comprehension of changes occurring in the content 
of 
principles of battle and of methods of their application, and 
development of creative, innovative qualities of military cadres 
are an insistent demand of the time. Experience shows that if an 
officer is devoid of tactical flexibility and adheres to 
banality, then for the most part he cannot apply principles of 
battle effectively. Such an officer has an extremely bare 
arsenal of tactics and, on the other hand, he has more than 
enough oversights and vexing chance happenings. Conversely, an 
active officer who thinks innovatively seemingly doubles or 
trebles the combat capabilities of his troops and increases 
chances for success. The slave to routine cannot get rid of the 
hobbles of dogmatic approaches. Liddell Hart wrote: "It is 
senseless to expect indirect actions of a mediocre general who 
acts straightforwardly and for whom prescribed rules are 
supreme."[.sup]14[/] 
  The basis of an officer's innovative approaches in practical 
application of principles of battle is his erudition, 
operational-tactical outlook, and level of military-theoretical 
training. Only a person who knows military affairs thoroughly 
and comprehensively, studies the probable enemy constantly, and 
supplements and expands his theoretical store can create, seek 
out, and develop tactics. An officer needs theory at every step. 
Not one question that is practical to any extent can be resolved 
without having been comprehended and substantiated 
theoretically. Profound, comprehensive knowledge permits an 
officer to adapt rapidly under any conditions, to assimilate new 
provisions of military art independently and in short time 
periods, and on this basis to seek new, nonstandard decisions 
for missions which arise. 
  An officer's military proficiency can be manifested only on 
the firm foundation of broad scientific knowledge. The one whose 
theoretical knowledge and general erudition is richer always is 
more prepared for a change of weapon systems and for tactical 
innovations. 
  An officer's proper application of principles of battle in 
preparing and conducting battle is impossible without mastering 
the art of dialectical analysis of phenomena of combat reality, 
which permits discovering the inner logic of their development 
and "coupling" a knowledge of logical patterns of warfare in his 
activity with practical embodiment of demands stemming from 
them. Dialectics gives a commander a powerful weapon, the 
method, by relying on which he can uncover the interrelationship 
of phenomena and identify the main, decisive element determining 
success of battle. Great physiologist I. P. Pavlov noted that 
"with a good method even a not very talented person can do a 
great deal. But with a poor method even a genius will work in 
vain and not obtain valuable, exact data."[.sup]15[/] 
  It is necessary to learn to correctly apply principles of 
battle based on a rational learning of lessons from past combat 
experience. Military history is a great teacher. The present 
stands firmly on the shoulders of the past and rests just as 
firmly on wings of the future. The value of the inexhaustible 
treasure-house of military art is that it moves apart the 
framework of an individual's experience which is historically 
limited to a brief time and small space, enriches him with 
cognition of the experience of preceding generations, and 
brightens his thinking with the wise acts of talented field 
generals of the past. The great field generals always regarded 
history with reverence. Napoleon admonished: "Wage an offensive 
war like Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, Gustavus Adolphus, 
Turenne, Prince Eugene and Frederick; read and then reread the 
history of their 83 campaigns and form your thinking on them; 
this is the only means of becoming a great field general and 
divining the secrets of art; enlightened in that way, your 
awareness will discard rules which are contrary to the 
principles to which the great people adhered."[.sup]16[/] 
  Cognition of past combat experience always is beneficial. Of 
course, military history is incapable of giving answers to 
today's urgent questions. It cannot part the curtains of the 
future, but historical experience is able to persuade, exhort, 
inspire and impregnate an officers' creative thinking, direct 
him to deep reflection and expand his knowledge, and already 
this in itself is a great deal. 
  Combat experience achieved through much sweat and blood of 
many generations permits an officer to choose his aims in life, 
arms him with a value orientation, awakens an innovative spirit 
and a constructive beginning, teaches him to see reality through 
the prism of time, and helps him purposefully solve problems of 
modern times from a scientific standpoint. Historical experience 
of wars also is valuable in that it teaches not only what to do 
and how to do it, but also what should not be done and helps 
avoid repetition of mistakes and find proper ways of 
accomplishing combat missions under modern conditions. By taking 
advantage of historical methods it is possible, in Engels' 
words, to obtain "clarification of the development 
process"[.sup]17[/] and consequently to identify trends, 
trace how principles developed, what stages of evolution they 
went through, and what factors influenced their formation. 
  The study of combat experience should not be passively 
contemplative. It is possible to learn proper lessons from it 
only by examining events in a close interrelationship with those 
conditions and circumstances which took shape at that time. It 
is important here to display maximum objectivity and take into 
account not only the positive, but also the negative 
aspects--the mistakes, miscalculations and shortcomings in 
actions of commanders, staffs and troops. 
  Realization of demands of the principles in a combat 
situation occurs in struggle and involves overcoming a multitude 
of chance happenings occurring literally at every step. And only 
an officer-organizer who has iron will, courage and fearlessness 
and is capable of taking a daring risk where necessary can count 
on success. Hence it is important to comprehensively develop 
organizational, moral-volitional and psychological qualities in 
military cadres. 
  Bagration once remarked wisely that the engagement is a 
simple matter, but winning victory in it is difficult. The 
battle and engagement now have become many times more 
complicated, and difficulties connected with implementing 
decisions also have increased a hundredfold. The battle always 
was a process of fierce confrontation and punished severely for 
oversights and mistakes, which obligated commanders to prepare 
it with all responsibility. Military leaders who participated in 
the Great Patriotic War noted in their memoirs the kinds of 
torture and doubts in which the commander's concepts originated 
each time and what will, courage and ability were required of 
them in decisionmaking. R. Ya. Malinovskiy noted that "the 
moment of decisionmaking was a difficult one for the commanding 
general. You must decide on a great cause and give yourself 
entirely only to one often very risky but very necessary 
decision. In these cases thought works intensely and is full of 
contradictions. One is that the desired decision encounters all 
kinds of objections in terms of calculations; another is that 
enormous difficulties are encountered in implementing it; a 
third is that what is tempting, simple and safe frees one of all 
concerns and legal liability. That is how doubts, difficulties 
and strivings intertwine. But a decision definitely has to be 
made. This demands great courage and enormous 
willpower."[.sup]18[/] 
  It is understandable that such qualities of a commander's 
character as self-control in dangerous situations, courage in 
making responsible decisions, independence, decisiveness and 
determination in achieving the set goal, persistence in 
overcoming difficulties, vigorousness and high working capacity 
do not come to an officer of themselves. It is necessary to 
persistently and purposefully form them in classes and exercises 
in the troops and during training in higher military educational 
institutions. 
  An inclination of some officers to use stereotypes in 
decisionmaking and attempts to find methods of attaining the 
goal by the method of copying another's experience are enemy 
number one in command and control activity. A stereotype's 
tenacity in tactics is explained by the search for easy ways to 
success. Adherence to a stereotype most often is inherent in a 
person whose knowledge is meager and whose operational-tactical 
outlook is narrow. An original idea simply does not appear in 
the officer, but there is a scheme set aside in memory according 
to which either he himself or someone else acted in a similar 
situation. The way to eradicate such a situation is clear--it is 
necessary to elevate the officer's tactical erudition, explain 
to him (best of all from historical examples) where unchanging, 
repetitive actions lead in battle and at the same time show how 
to creatively accomplish missions in the situation at hand, 
achieve surprise, employ stratagem and so on. 
  Often it also happens that an officer is sufficiently 
erudite 
and tactically trained, but still acts conventionally in making 
a decision for battle and does not seek original ways of 
performing the mission. The logic of his reasoning usually is as 
follows: Why take a risk and employ something new? What if 
failure befalls me? In this case the reason for manifestation of 
a stereotype is of a psychological nature. It is the fear of 
responsibility for a bold decision. Consequently, a commander 
must be taught the ability to take a risk, not recklessly, not 
precipitously, but calculatingly and farsightedly. 
  The question has been discussed among military theorists and 
practitioners since olden times as to what should predominate in 
a military leader: Mind or will? Napoleon, for example, believed 
that a field general must have a certain balance between mind 
(talent) and will (character, courage). If character prevails 
over the mind, he said, the field general often acts erroneously 
and, conversely, if the mind outweighs bravery he acts 
indecisively. His companion-in-arms Marshal Marmont reasoned 
differently. In examining the correlation among basic 
field-general qualities, he gave preference to will: "If 
willpower is more strongly developed than mental activity," he 
said, "there is a high probability that the goal will be 
achieved. But if the mind dominates character, a constant change 
of decisions, goals and designs appears..."[.sup]19[/] 
  History resolved this argument of the field generals long 
ago. Combat experience shows that a military leader was equal to 
the occasion only when he combined in himself intellectual and 
organizing qualities--high education, natural intellect, 
farsightedness and prudence, the versatile gift of an organizer, 
an iron will, courage and fearlessness. For example, here is how 
G. K. Zhukov's field-general qualities were described by 
Lieutenant General N. A. Antipenko, his deputy for the rear who 
went through many engagements with him. "A deep inner and outer 
composure, smartness of appearance, high exactingness, 
straightforwardness and principle in views and in relationships 
with people, iron will and an inability to adapt himself to 
anyone's sentiments and opinions whomsoever--these are his 
personality traits which generate a deep respect in me for 
Zhukov.[.sup]20[/] 
  And here is another example. Knowing N. F. Vatutin well, A. 
M. Vasilevskiy wrote: "He was able to decisively concentrate 
personnel and equipment on the main axis, build up efforts and 
suddenly deliver powerful attacks against the flank and rear of 
enemy groupings, skillfully employ large masses of tanks for 
developing the offensive into the operational depth, organize 
firm interworking of combat arms and branches of the Armed 
Forces, and reliably maintain continuous, firm command and 
control."[.sup]21[/] 
  We will note in conclusion that fears of the following 
nature 
sometimes are expressed unjustifiably: Applying principles of 
battle developed by combat experience instils a stereotyped 
approach to accomplishing combat missions. We will make bold to 
assert that such reasoning has no foundation. To the contrary, a 
knowledge and use of principles reflected in field and other 
manuals are a starting point for development of the commander's 
creative initiative. By relying on their provisions and the 
recommendations of regulations, he has an opportunity to seek 
new ways and methods of applying them, arrive at correct 
practical conclusions based on theoretical premises, and develop 
his own commander's "signature." 
<H5>  Conclusions and Recommendations </H5>
  1. The principles of battle are the theoretical frame of 
tactics, its basic scientific foundation. These are not 
arbitrary constructions of theorists' intellect, but the product 
of many centuries of military practice, a compilation of 
military wisdom of many, many generations. The entire lengthy 
historical experience of wars indicates that without guiding 
tactical rules--the principles of battle--directing practice 
along the most correct path and without their regulating role, 
it is impossible to imagine any rational practical activity of 
the commander or staff officer in exercising command and control 
in battle. 
  2. The vitality of principles of military art is that they 
objectively reflect the nature and character of warfare and its 
logical patterns and so allow commanders and staffs to orient 
themselves properly in the most difficult situation, find the 
most effective methods of employing weapons and combat 
equipment, and strive for the enemy's defeat by military art. 
  3. A knowledge of principles of battle becomes a physical 
force on condition that in conformity with a specific situation 
an officer is able to put their demands into practice, thereby 
placing their powerful creative potential at his service. 
  4. Demands of the principles of battle are realized 
practically in complex, unique ways. It always is like solving a 
problem with many unknowns. And the more complicated the battle, 
the stronger the enemy and the more powerful his weapons, the 
more flexible tactical thinking must be. Each time an officer 
must take a new approach to choosing effective ways of achieving 
the goal. 
  5. The value of principles of military art lies in the fact 
that they do not in any way bind an officer's initiative but, 
conversely, grant him a certain freedom in choosing methods of 
operations in performing a specific practical mission. Mobility 
of a search, daring of thinking, a bold risk, realistic 
calculation and reliance on a scientific foundation are 
necessary for creative embodiment of demands of the principles 
of military art. 
  6. Principles of battle are not realized each one 
individually, but in an interrelationship. Each principle is 
only a separate link in a common chain. Achieving success in 
battle requires skillful use of the full scientific arsenal of 
tactics and its fundamental principles. 
  7. Having a common basis, principles of all component parts 
of military art--strategy, operational art and tactics--ensure 
uniformity of views of military cadres at all levels on methods 
of preparing and conducting combat operations. But commonality 
of starting positions does not preclude different approaches to 
applying the demands of a particular principle in a specific 
situation.

<H5>  CHAPTER TWO - PERMANENT COMBAT READINESS OF SUBUNITS </H5>
  Permanent combat readiness of subunits consists 
of their capability of entering battle in an organized manner at 
any time and at prescribed time periods and performing assigned 
missions successfully. 
  "Boyevoy ustav 
Sukhoputnykh voysk" [Ground Troops Field Manual], Part II 
<H3>  1. From the History of the Origin and Development of the 
Principle of Combat Readiness </H3>
  Each time I have occasion to speak and read about combat 
readiness, there invariably appears before me the indelible 
picture of 22 June 1941, which I witnessed with my own eyes. The 
tornado of artillery fire which suddenly came down on the 
barracks at dawn, the fire which soon blazed up, Red Army men 
rushing about in disarray, the incoherent bustle, the orderly's 
belated command "Combat alert!" and the confusion and 
helplessness of commanders who were trying to get their bearings 
in the situation, establish communications with the senior 
commander, receive at least some kind of instructions and take 
control into their own hands--all this was perceived as a 
nightmarish dream. I finally came to my senses only when I heard 
the desperate appeal for help of a comrade who had been caught 
beneath a heap of rubble. That was how the Great Patriotic War 
began for me. 
  Even now, after 50 years have elapsed since that time, I do 
not cease to ask myself: "How could this have happened?" For on 
the evening before, on Sunday, we heard the cheerful song over 
the radio: "Should tomorrow war come, should tomorrow we march, 
be ready today for the march." The song not only summoned, but 
also inspired: "And we'll crush the enemy with little blood, 
with a powerful blow!" 
  And a week before that we were read an address of the Baltic 
Military District Military Council. "...Today as never before," 
it said, "we must be in full combat readiness. . . . Everyone 
must understand this firmly and clearly, since we must be ready 
to perform the combat mission at any minute..." Later I found 
this portentous document in the Ministry of Defense Central 
Archives.[.sup]1[/] 
  During the War, in the circle of other officers we often 
discussed events of 22 June and said: "No! After everything we 
have gone through, this must not be repeated, the lesson is too 
cruel and instructive." And in fact if we take our military 
literature of today, it is a rare book in which you will not 
find the call to "strengthen combat readiness." But each appeal, 
even the most serious one, loses acuteness from frequent use. 
That often happens with us even now... But about this later. Now 
I would like to say that the tragic events of 1941 might not 
have happened had we been respectful toward military history, 
had we known it, had we not been deaf to its lessons. The fact 
is, the Russo-Japanese War (which, as we know, also began 
suddenly) was a great warning for us. History is a great, wise 
teacher. The past, even the very distant past, teaches a great 
deal. This is why I decided to begin my account about combat 
readiness with history. 
  Although the term "combat readiness" became current and 
began 
to be regarded as one of the principles of military art 
relatively recently, from time immemorial military leaders have 
observed its requirements and attempted to keep the Army in such 
a state that it was capable of going on the march and defeating 
or repelling the enemy. It was ancient Roman historian Onasander 
who wrote about this. In the work "Manual for Military Leaders" 
he recommended, in organizing the march, to keep the foe 
continuously in view even if he is far away, and during a day 
rest halt set up a reinforced camp, post a perimeter guard and 
reinforce it for the night.[.sup]2[/] Vegetius also wrote 
about the importance of soldiers constantly maintaining 
vigilance. In the book "A Brief Exposition of Military Affairs" 
he noted that, caught unawares, even the most tried and tested 
fighting men can be defeated.[.sup]3[/] 
  Thus, the question of ensuring troop combat readiness in one 
form or another ran through military treatises without fail 
already at the dawn of the origin of military art. Similar 
thoughts also occurred in early Old Russian military works. In 
undertaking a march, be careful, directed Vladimir Monomakh in 
his "Poucheniya" [Precepts], "detail the guard yourself . . . be 
in no haste to put down your weapon..." 
  During the third campaign and the taking of Kazan (1552), 
Ivan the Terrible gave great attention to stopping surprise 
enemy sallies and he concerned himself with organizing security 
and reconnaissance. Experience gained in combat expeditions was 
reflected in the "Ustav pogranichnoy (storozhevoy, stanichnoy i 
dozornoy) sluzhby" [Manual of Border (Sentry, Stanitsa and 
Patrol) Duty] published in 1571, and subsequently also in the 
first Russian Army manual published in 1621, the "Ustav ratnykh, 
pushechnykh i drugikh del, kasayushchikhsya do voyennoy nauki, 
sostoyashchikh v 663 ukazakh i statyakh" [Manual of Military, 
Gunnery and Other Affairs Concerning Military Science, 
Consisting of 663 Edicts and Articles]. It noted that the Army 
must prepare for war in advance. "At the present time it has 
become clear that war and hostility are not unexpected and soon 
will begin moving and will take place." Therefore it is 
necessary "to prepare to meet it so we are ready and armed 100 
days before a meeting engagement."[.sup]4[/] The manual gave 
recommendations on how to act "should there be an alert day or 
night, where which people should be and to where which people 
should ride or run, and who should do what."[.sup]5[/] 
  Combat operations took on a more decisive character with the 
appearance of firearms. This heightened demands for maintaining 
combat readiness. Certain new elements appeared in its content. 
More attention began to be given to supporting the troops with 
supplies and to upkeep of weapons and gear. 
  To Peter the Great belongs the astute thought that "one 
always must know the enemy" and what "he can do," "in order that 
in all matters he can be sought out and overturned." The "Ustav 
voinskiy" [Military Regulations] of Peter I noted: "Firmly 
reconnoiter the enemy," "establish security," and "assume battle 
order (combat formation) on time."[.sup]6[/] These precepts 
of Peter I came from life suffering itself. The Russian Army was 
taught a cruel lesson at the beginning of the Northern War 
(1700-1721). By that time Peter had not yet managed to establish 
a combat-effective army which could oppose a strong enemy--the 
Swedish Army headed by skillful field general Carl XII. The 
Swedes managed to rout the Russians in the Battle of Narva. But 
Peter managed to learn an instructive lesson from this 
defeat--he took to creating a regular army and outfitting and 
training it with even greater energy. In assessing these events, 
Marx wrote: "Narva was the first serious defeat for a rising 
nation whose resolute spirit learned to win even from 
defeats."[.sup]7[/] 
  Peter began increasing the Army's combat effectiveness 
beginning with the most important thing--establishing 
centralized command and control. A unified manpower acquisition 
system was established and standard arms and gear of the Army as 
well as a unified training system distinguished by simplicity 
and practicality were introduced. Peter demanded intelligent 
actions of the soldiers and that they learn "how to act in 
battle."[.sup]8[/] Ten years had not gone by since the battle 
of Narva when the Russian Army acquired the capability not only 
of battling the Swedes "as equals," but also of defeating them. 
  The regular army's rearming had been completed by the Battle 
of Poltava: The infantry received smoothbore shoulder arms with 
bayonets, smallswords, broadswords, and hand grenades; the 
dragoons received carbines, pistols and palache sabers; the 
artillery was divided into siege, fortress, field and 
regimental. Regiments' combat proficiency improved 
radically.[.sup]9[/] The brilliant victory at Poltava was the 
result. In revealing the enormous scale of Peter's military 
reforms, M. V. Lomonosov remarked that he was able "to recruit 
many great regiments--infantry and cavalry, supply all with 
clothing, salary, weapons and other military gear, teach them a 
new manual of arms, start up field and siege artillery according 
to the rules, for which a great deal of knowledge of geometry, 
mechanics and chemistry is required, and besides all else have 
commanders skilled in everything."[.sup]10[/] He made 
approving comments about establishment of a regular army and 
about Peter's decision to have regiments in readiness to protect 
the country against attack. 
  The fact that the most advanced form of troop 
training--exercises and maneuvers--began to be employed under 
Peter was of great importance for improving the Army's combat 
readiness. They were considered by him "as a precursor of 
things."[.sup]11[/] Exercises and maneuvers included field 
battles, assaults on fortified camps and fortresses, and so on. 
Such maneuvers take their origin from the Semenovskoye 
(1690-1693) and Kozhukhov (1694) campaigns.[.sup]12[/] 
  Traditions laid down by Peter with respect to maintaining 
Army combat readiness and demands not to lag behind the enemy in 
proficiency and aggressiveness, to anticipate his tactical ruses 
and to "set a trap" for the enemy himself were continued and 
developed by Russian military leaders P. S. Saltykov and P. A. 
Rumyantsev. In the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) the Russian Army 
surpassed the Prussian Army in the level of training and combat 
proficiency, as attested by its brilliant victories in the 
battle at Gross-Jagersdorf and Kunersdorf, in the taking 
of 
the Kohlberg Fortress and in the taking of Berlin. 
  The introduction to troop training practice of summer 
encampments for 1-3 months a year at Rumyantsev's suggestion 
following the Seven Years' War was of great importance for 
keeping the Russian Army in a state of appropriate combat 
readiness. Major exercises involving infantry, cavalry and 
artillery regiments were held during such summer encampments. 
  It was to A. V. Suvorov's credit with respect to upgrading 
Army combat readiness that he subordinated essentially the 
entire troop training system to attaining this goal. The field 
general invariably adhered to the motto: "Be as in war even in 
peacetime." He developed and practiced an effective system for 
training and educating soldiers based not on excessive drills 
and mechanical execution of commands, but on each soldier's 
understanding of his own maneuver. Suvorov instilled a feeling 
of patriotic pride, mutual assistance, courage and initiative in 
soldiers. Maneuvers (marches) conducted by Suvorov--Crimean, 
Tulchin and others--were distinguished by great instructiveness. 
  In studying combat training methods employed by Suvorov, the 
Frenchman Dubocage noted that there could be no chance 
happenings, no obstacles for his army. Such an army cannot help 
but win. Suvorov's methods were such that even "the last soldier 
who ended up in the sphere of his influence came to know combat 
matters better both practically and theoretically than is now 
known in any European army. . . . There was nothing unexpected 
in battle for his soldier, since he experienced the most 
difficult of combat impressions in peacetime. For him there 
could be nothing incomprehensible in what occurred in battle. . 
. . If a person is so seasoned that it is impossible to surprise 
him with anything and if he knows what he is doing in his modest 
sphere, he cannot be defeated, he cannot help but 
win."[.sup]13[/] 
  M. I. Kutuzov showed steadfast concern for keeping Russian 
Army combat readiness at the appropriate level. In battles he 
demanded that commanders organize and conduct effective 
reconnaissance "so as to uncover the French plans in time" and 
constantly know the status, combat effectiveness, state of 
supply, and state of morale of their army. A number of measures 
aimed at improving combat readiness were carried out in the 
Russian Army based on experience of the Patriotic War of 
1812-1814, but many innovations were of a dual nature. The 
"Stroyevoy ustav (rotnoye, batalonnoye i polkovoye ucheniya)" 
[Drill Regulations (Company, Battalion and Regimental 
Exercises)] published in the first quarter of the 19th century 
combined principles of new column tactics with linear tactics. 
Instructions and manuals developed directly in the troops were 
more progressive in nature. Among them, for example, were 
"Pravila rassypnogo stroya" [Rules of Extended Order] and 
"Nastavleniye g.g. pekhotnym ofitseram v den srazheniya 
[Instructions for Infantry Officers on the Day of 
Battle].[.sup]14[/] 
  But it often happened that the lively, creative thought of 
foremost military figures was suppressed by lack of talent and 
conventionalism. Slavery to routine, parade-ground drills and 
blind emulation of the Prussian military school prevailed in 
training methods despite combat experience. Any initiative of 
subordinates was suppressed and cane discipline was implanted. 
Basic attention in training was given to drill training. 
Maneuvers essentially reduced to tactical drill problems. All 
this had a pernicious effect on Russian Army combat 
effectiveness and delayed its development for a long time. The 
Russian Army also lagged behind European armies in technical 
outfitting. The defeat in the Crimean War (1853-1856) resulted 
from this.[.sup]15[/] The heroism of soldiers could not 
compensate for backwardness of military training and the 
"rottenness and impotence of a Russia based on 
serfdom."[.sup]16[/] 
  Russia's defeat in the Crimean War generated criticism of 
Nikolay's military system. Progressive figures called for a 
decisive revision of the existing military structure and this 
had an effect. The military reforms of 1864-1877 in Russia 
carried out under the direction of Military Minister D. A. 
Milyutin completed the process of converting a feudal army into 
a bourgeois type of army. The Army became a mass army with the 
introduction of universal military obligation in 1874. Field 
manuals--the "Ustav o polevoy sluzhbe" [Field Service 
Regulations] (1858, 1879, 1881)--were republished based on 
combat experience gained in the Crimean War and with 
consideration of the troops' new material base (rifled weapons 
had been adopted). They consolidated new forms and methods of 
fighting and methods of combat training. 
  I. V. Gurko and M. I. Dragomirov played a major role in 
reviving traditions of Peter and Suvorov in the Army. The basis 
of Dragomirov's views on questions of combat training was the 
assertion that the Army's principal strength lay in the 
individual and his preparedness for battle, since the readiness 
both of small subunits as well as of the Army as a whole depends 
on the training of every soldier. His "Uchebnik taktiki" 
[Textbook of Tactics] noted that the main goal of education is 
to instill in the soldier a sense of duty taken to 
self-sacrifice and to instill in him fearlessness, 
resourcefulness and mutual assistance. Speaking of training, he 
emphasized that it was necessary to teach the soldier to 
skillfully master weapons, adroitly overcome obstacles 
encountered on the terrain, and coordinate his movements with 
comrades' actions. 
  Beginning with the latter half of the 19th century annual 
district maneuvers, so-called "imperial" maneuvers, began to be 
held in the Russian Army in which a large number of troops took 
part (Kursk maneuvers of 1902). The importance of ensuring the 
Army's high combat readiness in wars of the machine period rose 
especially sharply, dictated by the intensive development of 
means of warfare and major changes in the nature and methods of 
combat operations--their increased scale and spatial scope and 
the increased role of the factor of surprise. The Russian Army 
combat readiness system was given a serious test during the 
Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), where major miscalculations in 
command and control came to light. Underestimation of the enemy 
and "boasts of easy victory" had their effect. Because of poor 
intelligence the Russian command did not manage to promptly 
identify the moment of the Japanese attack. Poor logistic 
support had an especially negative effect on the Army's combat 
effectiveness. The troops constantly felt a most acute shortage 
of shells and cartridges. Russo-Japanese War experience played 
no small role in upgrading the combat readiness system. The war 
provided very abundant food for thought for military 
researchers. There were many Russian military theorists who 
wrote about the importance of profound comprehension of the 
lessons learned, but after the war no cardinal changes occurred 
in Russian Army training or its combat readiness system. The 
combat experience was far from completely reflected in field 
manuals and field service regulations republished in the period 
from 1906 through 1914. Many conditionalities and deviations 
from requirements of combat practice continued to be allowed in 
exercises, and stereotype and routine continued to predominate. 
Large maneuvers reduced basically to movements. Interworking and 
combat and logistic support were poorly rehearsed in them, and a 
contemptuous attitude was shown toward defense. 
  Nevertheless, many armies learned one important lesson with 
respect to troop combat readiness from Russo-Japanese War 
experience before the beginning of World War I. General staffs 
began to strive to increase the manning of formations and units, 
especially with command personnel, back in peacetime. The task 
was to ensure that border formations could enter battle without 
additional mobilization. As a result, prior to World War I the 
division personnel strength level was brought to the following 
indicators: Up to 100 percent officers, around 70 percent NCO's 
and up to 50 percent rank-and-file in the German Army; up to 
76.4 percent officers, 54.5 percent NCO's and 43.6 percent 
rank-and-file in the French Army; and up to 85 percent officers, 
42 percent NCO's and 48 percent rank-and-file in the Russian 
Army.[.sup]17[/] 
  Nevertheless, this was only a half-measure. Essentially all 
armies had many major shortcomings in the important thing, 
specifically in combat proficiency. Provisions of field manuals 
and field service regulations proved obsolete. They did not meet 
requirements of war. In the work "Voprosy sovremennoy strategii" 
[Questions of Modern Strategy] M. N. Tukhachevskiy wrote: "Not 
one army was guided by those military statutes and regulations 
with which it entered the war in 1914. Each year armies had to 
change their regulations and create new instructions, and they 
had to reteach both the different combat arms and the staffs 
these new instructions. Each year war plans also underwent 
modification."[.sup]18[/] 
  The battlefield employment of large masses of artillery and 
new weapons--choking gases, tanks, aircraft, flamethrowers and 
so on--predetermined the special importance of the "technical 
factor" in the combat readiness system--the personnel's 
knowledge of their own and enemy weapons and the ability to 
employ them in battle and fight new enemy weapons. It so 
happened that when a particular side used previously unknown 
kinds of weapons for the first time in battle, this usually 
generated a psychological shock in personnel or even led to the 
appearance of mass panic. As a result combat operations were 
paralyzed for a more or less lengthy time. 
  The Battle of Ypres (1915) was typical in this respect. 
Violating an international agreement, the Germans made a 
chemical attack on British troops. To support a breakthrough of 
the defense, they undertook a gas-cylinder attack in which 180 
tons of chlorine were used simultaneously from 6,000 cylinders 
set up across a 10 km front. Such an attack proved to be a total 
surprise for the British and their actions in this sector were 
halted. The battlefield ended up lifeless. The Germans advanced 
into the depth of the defense without a single 
shot.[.sup]19[/] And if this battle did not substantially 
affect the subsequent course of military events, it was only 
because the German command was unprepared to exploit results of 
the new weapon's employment. 
  It should be said that surprise employment of new weapons 
also occurred in subsequent operations of World War I. Revenge, 
as it were, by the British on the Germans followed soon after 
the Battle of Ypres. In the Battle on the River Somme (1916) 
they employed a very effective weapon, tanks. Although at that 
time tank combat performance characteristics were poor (they had 
a speed only of 3 km/hr), their appearance on the battlefield 
caused panic among the Germans. According to German soldier 
eyewitnesses, "everyone stood stricken as if having lost the 
capability of moving. The enormous monsters approached us 
slowly, clanking, limping and rocking, but all the time they 
advanced. Nothing held them up. Someone in the first line of 
trenches said that the devil had appeared, and this word spread 
through the trenches with enormous speed."[.sup]20[/] As a 
result the British achieved that success in a day of battle 
which they had been unable to achieve in 4-5 days since the 
operation began. 
  World War I experience greatly influenced further 
improvement 
of the armies' combat readiness system. It became obvious that 
troops had to be prepared purposefully for lengthy, strenuous 
combat operations long before the beginning of war. Not only did 
appropriate manning of formations and units with personnel have 
to be ensured, but their personal gear and equipment, good 
technical outfitting, armament, and combat cohesiveness had to 
be provided for and necessary stockpiles created in good time. 
Following World War I military theorists and practitioners in 
many armies drew an important conclusion: Maintaining armies at 
the proper level of combat readiness above all necessitated 
careful study of the initial period of war and preparation of 
troops for the first battles, in which they certainly would 
encounter many surprises. Many authors wrote that the beginning 
of war always is an enormous psychological shock for troops; 
therefore it is important to prepare personnel for overcoming 
difficulties and to master new tactics in advance. 
  A. I. Yegorov correctly foresaw the nature of the initial 
period of the future war. In 1933 he wrote: "Using methods of 
covert mobilization, the warring side will strive to assemble 
those forces and assets as early and as quickly as possible with 
whose help it is possible to invade enemy territory and disrupt 
mobilization in border areas and concentration of the army of 
one's enemy. . . . By operations from the air and the landing of 
assault parties, enemy aircraft can actively hamper the course 
of transport movements at a depth of 600-800 km (the 
Moscow-Kharkov meridian)..."[.sup]21[/] This was a truly 
prophetic warning which, however, was left without proper 
attention. M. N. Tukhachevskiy, B. M. Shaposhnikov, G. S. 
Isserson, A. M. Zayonchkovskiy, V. A. Melikov, S. N. 
Krasilnikov, Ye. A. Shilovskiy, M. R. Galaktionov and others 
made no small contribution to developing questions of the 
initial period of war. 
  Among Western European military theorists Friedrich von 
Bernhardi, von Moltke Jr., de Grandmaison and F. Foch paid great 
attention to researching the first operations of war. Thus, Foch 
wrote: "Surprise strategic deployments, swift marches and 
lightninglike offensives with which the first clashes of 
European wars break out like thunderclaps obligate armies to 
devote careful attention to their study."[.sup]22[/] 
  V. I. Lenin laid down the methodological foundations on 
whose 
basis the theory and practice of ensuring Red Army combat 
readiness developed. He constantly emphasized that "we must keep 
our Red Army in full combat readiness no matter what and 
reinforce its combat effectiveness."[.sup]23[/] "We will 
commit a terrible crime against the Revolution," he noted, "if 
we forget this."[.sup]24[/] Lenin's works and his directives 
on military questions during the Civil War gave paramount 
attention to such factors ensuring Army combat readiness as 
maintaining a high revolutionary vigilance in Red Army men, Red 
Navy men and commanders, knowledge of the enemy, Army and Navy 
technical outfitting, training of military cadres, creation of a 
unified command element for all Red Army detachments, raising 
the personnel's morale, and strengthening military discipline. 
Lenin warned that it was necessary to be always on guard. He 
wrote: "To let something slip by or to lose one's head means to 
lose everything."[.sup]25[/] 
  In the interwar period much was done in our Army to improve 
troop combat effectiveness. This was caused by the complication 
of the international situation and by military provocations 
repeatedly being undertaken by our enemies on the USSR's 
borders. Taking into account the growing threat of military 
attack, the Soviet government devoted constant attention to 
strengthening the Armed Forces' combat power, above all to their 
technical outfitting, and it must be said that much was 
achieved. The adoption in 1939 of the new Law on Universal 
Military Obligation, which established a unified system for Army 
and Navy manpower acquisition, was of great importance for 
improving Army combat readiness. Much attention was given to 
improving the combat and political training of troops. 
  Beginning in the 1930's it was the practice to hold major 
opposed-forces military maneuvers. Thus, maneuvers were held in 
the Ukrainian Military District in 1931, test exercises in the 
Volga area during 1932-1933, and large-scale maneuvers in the 
Kiev Special Military District in 1935 in which questions of the 
deep operation and battle were rehearsed. Airborne troops took 
part in them for the first time. In all, more than 1,000 tanks 
were in action here. Subsequently more than 1,300 tanks, 632 
aircraft, and 2,276 various vehicles took part in a Belorussian 
Military District exercise.[.sup]26[/] 
  Nevertheless, the combat readiness system of Red Army troops 
was far from perfect in prewar times. The very first relatively 
small-scale military conflicts indicated that combat proficiency 
of formations and units did not meet the demands of war. Thus, 
despite our troops' overwhelming numerical superiority during 
the battles at Lake Khasan and the participation of tanks and 
aircraft in them, losses proved unjustifiably high (408 killed 
and 2,807 wounded).[.sup]27[/] The Soviet-Finnish War taught 
us an especially severe lesson with respect to combat readiness 
and combat effectiveness of troops. It was planned to defeat the 
enemy in 2-3 weeks, but in fact this required three and one-half 
months. The result was 289,500 killed, wounded or frostbitten. 
Finland lost 23,000 killed and 43,000 wounded in this war, i.e., 
several times less.[.sup]28[/] 
  The Soviet military leadership drew many useful conclusions 
from the experience of this war--decisive steps were taken to 
improve troop field proficiency, technical outfitting, personal 
gear and equipment and armament. And vigorous actions by 
People's Commissar of Defense S. K. Timoshenko must be given 
their due. Nevertheless, the main task of teaching personnel to 
fight in a modern way failed to be fully accomplished in the 
prewar period. The reason for this was that ideas which existed 
at that time on the nature of combined arms battle were far from 
the reality which troops encountered at the very beginning of 
the Great Patriotic War. A high price had to be paid for the 
fact that methods of repelling a surprise enemy invasion had not 
been mastered in peacetime. 
  The Great Patriotic War began in a completely different 
operational-strategic situation than that being created in 
prewar exercises and maneuvers. Tactics employed by the Germans 
of psychological attacks, deep tank spearheads, creation of 
large and small "pockets," and a drop of airborne assault forces 
and sabotage teams in our rear proved unexpected for the troops. 
The terrible events of those years again and again give a 
reminder of the immutable truth that war punishes severely for 
peacetime blunders in questions of combat readiness. One of the 
major mistakes in the Red Army combat readiness system in prewar 
years was that personnel were oriented toward easy conditions, 
toward winning victory "with little blood, with a powerful 
blow," and toward conducting combat operations on enemy 
territory. The defense was underestimated and the withdrawal and 
combat in encirclement were not studied, but it was specifically 
with difficult defensive battles, with a withdrawal, and with 
combat in encirclement that our troops' combat operations began, 
for which they were not ready. 
  The imperfection of the combat readiness system was one of 
the main preconditions for defeat of many armies in local wars 
as well. Their lack of readiness to repel the enemy's first 
surprise attack told. The multistep system that was used for 
placing formations in a combat-ready status in a period of 
threat and with the beginning of military operations, lengthy 
collection of situation data, slow and usually manual processing 
of that data, sluggishness in decisionmaking, and giving units 
and weapons imprecise and often belated or even contradictory 
instructions led to where the aggressor succeeded in catching 
troops unawares, seizing the initiative, imposing his will and 
dictating his conditions. 
  Now it has become obvious that many armies do not manage to 
restructure their combat readiness system and troop training in 
accordance with demands of scientific-technical progress. The 
appearance of new weapons catches unawares those who are 
unconcerned with timely modernization not only of their means of 
warfare, but also of tactics. Here are just a few examples from 
the experience of local wars. 
  The Korean War (1950-1953) broke out just five years after 
World War II, but even in this short time interval substantial 
changes occurred in technical outfitting of the armies of 
developed states. For example, for the first time here the U.S. 
Army used jet aviation, guided robot bombs, a massive amount of 
napalm, certain new types of antitank and antipersonnel mines, 
and new parachutes and devices for dropping guns, light prime 
movers, mortars and other combat equipment to the 
ground.[.sup]29[/] The Americans used new weapons in the 
Vietnam War (1964-1975) on an even wider scale. Guided 
projectiles, bombs and missiles; a massive number of combat 
helicopters; fuel-air explosives; and means of meteorological 
and geophysical warfare were used here for the first time. 
  The battlefield appearance of new, more effective weapons 
lent impetus to the upgrading of field training and the system 
of troop combat readiness. Tactics of airmobile operations 
originated in the Vietnam War, which marked the beginning of 
development of the modern U.S. Army operational-tactical 
"air-land operation (battle)" concept. The experience of this 
war showed that an indispensable element of troop field 
proficiency should be their ability to fight enemy airmobile 
troops, tactical airborne assault forces and raiding and 
reconnaissance parties and take measures for protection against 
mass destruction weapons and precision weapons. 
  Military operations in the Near East (1967, 1973, 1982) and 
the Anglo-Argentine military conflict (1982) dictated further 
development of methods of troop combat operations, and 
particularly lent impetus to the development of tactics of the 
long-range firefight, which began to be characterized by the 
sides' attempt to conduct a firefight beginning from maximum 
ranges. Arab combat operations against the Israelis developed 
into opposition of artillery against artillery, ATGM's against 
tanks, and tanks against tanks. Under such conditions the 
personnel's high weapon handling skill, their ability to hit the 
target with the first round, launch or pass, and execution of a 
flexible maneuver of fire became determining in troop field 
training. 
  Thus, in order to continuously upgrade the troop combat 
readiness system it is necessary to constantly keep up with the 
development of military affairs, the appearance of new weapons 
and changes in the probable enemy's operating tactics. There is 
nothing more pernicious than acting in the old way. As the heart 
of troop combat readiness, development of their tactical 
proficiency must not fail to keep in step with technical 
innovations. 
<H3>  2. Problems Connected With Upgrading Troop Combat Readiness 
at the Present Stage </H3>
  Under present conditions the significance of the principle 
of 
troop combat readiness has grown as never before. It has become 
the epicenter of all research conducted in military art. 
Everything now being done in questions of improving the table of 
organization structure of formations and units, their technical 
outfitting, the command and control system, combat proficiency, 
combat, technical and logistic support, strengthening of the 
personnel's political attitude and morale, and discipline and 
orderliness--All this in the final account is aimed at preparing 
the troops for organized commitment to battle in case of war and 
at their ability to repel an enemy attack and defeat him. Just 
what problems are arising now in upgrading the combat readiness 
system and what are the ways of solving them? 
  Correct, profound foresight of the nature of a future war 
for 
which it is necessary to prepare is the very first precondition 
for successful accomplishment of tasks of improving troop combat 
readiness. Exclusive responsibility for this rests with military 
theory. It is what must develop and determine the right 
reference points in combat training: What and how should the 
troops be taught so they are ready for any ordeals, have good 
mastery of weapons and the tactics of modern battle, know the 
probable enemy and his strong and weak sides, and be able to 
combat the latest weapons and protect themselves against them? 
  Developing scenarios of future battles is one of the most 
difficult tasks of military art. History attests to the fact 
that military theorists and practitioners far from always 
managed to penetrate the veil of time and display profound 
insight with respect to developing advisable methods of combat 
operations. It often happened that an army was prepared 
essentially not for a future war, but for a past war and 
mastered antiquated, obsolete methods of combat operations. In 
other cases military theory overestimated or, conversely, 
underestimated the experience of small wars and drew incorrect, 
one-sided conclusions from it regarding combat readiness. The 
influence of new weapons on tactics was not always taken fully 
and comprehensively into account and biases were allowed in 
assessments of the enemy's actual combat capabilities and 
methods of his probable operations with the initiation and 
conduct of war. 
  In our time forecasting the conditions and nature of a 
future 
war has become unbelievably complicated above all because the 
upgrading and replacement of means of warfare and the troops' 
technical outfitting is occurring at unprecedentedly rapid 
rates, and this introduces radical changes to battle tactics. It 
is common knowledge that under present conditions 3-4 
generations of equipment change in the life of one human 
generation.[.sup]30[/] Based on this, as shown by the 
experience of local wars, the attacking side's massive 
introduction of the latest systems of weapons and combat 
equipment previously unknown to the enemy as well as the use of 
unexpected tactics have become characteristic of combat 
operations in first operations. 
  But the most important distinction is that there is the 
danger of employment of nuclear weapons as well as of diverse 
systems of precision weapons (reconnaissance-strike complexes, 
reconnaissance-fire complexes) which approximate nuclear 
weapons. Just the very fact of existence of these exceptionally 
effective kinds of weapons forces troops to be in constant 
readiness for operations when these weapons are employed and to 
take appropriate measures of protection. 
  Special demands on the troop combat readiness system at the 
present stage also stem from the circumstance that there has 
been a sharp increase in the significance of the factor of 
surprise, which largely predetermines not only the course and 
outcome of first operations, but also of the entire military 
campaign. The experience of local wars has shown clearly that 
its pernicious consequences became irreversible in those armies 
which did not take advance measures to prevent surprise. In this 
connection one important task of military theory is to 
comprehensively research and come up with recommendations on 
upgrading the combat readiness system so an aggressor cannot 
catch troops unawares and unprepared and so they can repel an 
enemy invasion in any (even the most difficult) situation, 
deliver a retaliatory attack against him and successfully 
execute assigned combat missions. 
  The combat readiness system cannot form abstractly, without 
consideration of specific conditions of the troops' entry into 
war. Research has shown that the first days of war and the first 
battles are the most difficult, critical moments for them. It is 
initial operations that are the touchstone on which the vitality 
of the prewar combat readiness system, the provisions of 
regulations developed in peacetime, the normative indicators of 
troop combat proficiency, the command and control system, the 
personnel's morale and fighting qualities, and so on are tested. 
  Hence the principal direction of peacetime combat training 
is 
to study conditions of operations of the initial period of war, 
which are characterized by special complexity and intensity; 
difficult predictability of development of combat events; 
abrupt, swift changes in the situation, in the troops' situation 
and status, and in the sides' force ratio; and the possibility 
of the unexpected appearance of critical situations, disruption 
of command and control, and disorganization of the work of the 
rear and lines of communication. 
  It is important to train personnel in good time so they have 
a clear picture of what they will encounter in actual battle and 
what kind of enemy they will come up against. They must be 
taught the ability to counter enemy tactics with their own more 
advanced tactics, employ a more skillful maneuver, and strive 
for a turning point in the situation and seizure of the 
initiative. For this it is necessary that every officer, NCO and 
private know his duties precisely and perform them without fuss 
in a combat alert so that in the terrible hour of ordeals 
equipment and weapons do not let him down and instruments, 
hardware and mechanisms operate faultlessly. 
  Battle sternly tests troops for combat maturity, ideological 
conditioning, staunchness, courage and bravery and punishes 
mercilessly for blunders. Readiness for military ordeals must be 
comprehensive. The modern soldier has to know and be capable of 
a great deal in order to successfully fight a strong, 
technically well outfitted enemy. He must surpass the enemy in 
tactical proficiency, psychological stability, the ability to 
handle weapons, and physical endurance. Special demands are 
placed on military proficiency and the organizing and volitional 
qualities of officers, their ability to flexibly lead troops, 
thoroughly foresee, quickly grasp and put into practice new 
methods of operations, clear the way for subordinates' creative 
undertakings and encourage their initiative. 
  The state of combat readiness is very dynamic. There can be 
no indifference, negligence or self-complacency in such a major, 
important matter. Normative indicators of combat proficiency are 
growing and becoming more complicated all the time. They are 
different today than they were yesterday, and tomorrow they 
inevitably will be different than today. Therefore the 
responsibility for the state of combat readiness is constantly 
increasing. 
  Let us pose the question: Are we doing everything in the 
Army 
now as demanded by conditions of modern war from the standpoint 
of adjusting the effectiveness of combat training so that it is 
possible to say with all confidence that the mistakes of 1941 
will not be repeated? Judging from external manifestations, the 
call to strengthen combat readiness and to teach what is 
necessary in war is not leaving the pages of the military press 
and is constantly and persistently being repeated here, there 
and everywhere. 
  But deep-seated processes also indicate something else: 
Concern is growing among the officers for the state of affairs 
in troop combat readiness. People are arguing in a concerned 
way, thinking, and seeking an answer to questions which life 
poses for them. Among the problems relating to troop combat 
proficiency, greatest attention is drawn by the following: Why 
have our tactics, which absorbed the rich experience of the 
past, which stood up under a severe test on the battlefields, 
and which proved their indisputable superiority over tactics of 
leading world armies in years of the Civil War and Great 
Patriotic War, lately begun to fall behind the demands of life, 
thus having a negative effect on troop combat readiness? Why 
have stereotype and conservatism penetrated deeply into combat 
training? Why have formalism and conventionalism with their 
inherent maximum programmed nature of problems and exercises, 
the authoritarian assessments and judgements in scientific 
research, and the abstract schemes and hard-and-fast postulates 
been implanted for a long time instead of bold, innovative 
searches? 
  Pertinent, vital, painful questions are posed. Without 
having 
answered them, without having delved into the reasons which 
dictated the dominant influence in the troop training system of 
dogmatic blinders which shackle officers' creative thinking and 
retard the perestroyka process, it is impossible to accomplish 
the cardinal task of achieving a radical turning point in 
improving troop combat training. 
  It should be said that negative phenomena in combat training 
have been accumulating for us for years and even decades; as a 
result not one, but a multitude of different objective and 
subjective reasons have been concentrated which predetermined 
the stagnation in troop training and education. Above all we 
will note that the very difficult process of developing military 
affairs cannot be understood and explained correctly if it is 
considered by itself, outside of contact with the life of 
society. Military organizational development always has been and 
is now under the determining influence of a system of 
sociopolitical and socioeconomic factors and acts as a unique 
reflection of their development level. The ailments of society 
in years of stagnation could not help but affect the state of 
the Armed Forces. This was manifested in particular in the fact 
that a firm belief was implanted in people's social awareness, 
including among servicemen, that our advance on all fronts was 
going according to "laws of accelerated development." This 
inspired confidence that we were steadily on the ascent and the 
thought did not arise about the possibility of any kind of lag. 
  The thesis that "advantages of the system of socialism also 
ensure advantages of its military organization"[.sup]31[/] 
was interpreted straightforwardly. In being guided by this 
thesis, the attention of military cadres was not always directed 
to the fact that the social system in itself merely creates 
objective preconditions for successful accomplishment of tasks 
and that it can in no way insure the Army against mistakes and 
lag. In this connection it is impossible not to reproach our 
military philosophers, whose sacred duty is to arm officers with 
correct methodological lines conforming to the spirit of the 
time and to act as pace-setters in an uncompromising struggle 
against manifestations of inertness, cliches, and routine in 
military affairs. Unfortunately, our military-philosophical 
thought did not withstand the "euphoria of general successes" in 
the stagnant times and did not perceive in due course the growth 
of crisis phenomena in combat training during the 1960's and 
1970's. 
  It is necessary to speak about this now because without the 
involvement of social sciences, without activation of the 
ideological-theoretical activity of military scientists, 
philosophers, sociologists, psychologists and economists, and 
without appropriate scientific and philosophical comprehension 
of the processes occurring in the Army, it is impossible to 
achieve a fundamental perestroyka of military science in 
accordance with new political thinking, a qualitative turning 
point in improvement of troop combat training, and the revival 
of tactics as a genuine art of conducting modern battle. But 
this by no means relieves the combined arms generals and 
officers of responsibility for the state of affairs in the 
troops. 
  The deep roots of the lag in the system of troop training 
and 
education must be sought first and foremost in routine tactical 
thinking, in administrative-pressure methods and voluntaristic 
methods of directing combat training, and in the dominant 
influence of ostentation, subjectivism and parochialism in the 
awareness of a certain portion of military cadres. 
  Speaking of reasons for a temporary suspension in questions 
of tactics, some authors are inclined to believe that this 
occurred to a certain extent through the fault of certain 
military leaders who came to prominence during the Great 
Patriotic War. These authors assume that their opinion, based on 
victorious combat experience, in the final account turned into a 
kind of pattern, into a stereotype.[.sup]32[/] Without a 
doubt, thoughtless fetishism of front experience and 
mechanically following it under new, altered conditions could 
not help but negatively affect the development of tactics, of 
military art as a whole, and the troop training system. But it 
would appear that one of the main reasons for the penetration of 
dogmatism and stagnation into combat training nevertheless lies 
in something else, in the fact that the very abundant combat 
experience of Soviet troops, won at a dear cost in fierce 
battles, in its time ceased to be analyzed from contemporary 
positions, largely remained unused, "did not work" in a genuine 
way to form officers' creative thinking, and did not contribute 
to the development of new operational-tactical concepts. 
  It is necessary to return to the first postwar years to find 
the roots of such a superficial attitude toward Soviet troops' 
combat experience. Immediately following the end of the Great 
Patriotic War an aureole of "infallibility" of Soviet tactics 
began to be created in the era of Stalin's cult of personality. 
This in itself precluded any kind of criticism of mistakes and 
failures, which of course occurred in combat readiness of 
formations and units in prewar time and which had a negative 
effect on the course of troop combat operations with the 
beginning of war. It was essentially completely forgotten that 
our Army, "armed" with obsolete tactics, entered into opposition 
with a very strong and very experienced fascist German Army and 
it essentially had to learn to fight anew in the flame of 
battles. 
  Common sense suggested that our Army's failures in 1941 
should not have passed without leaving a trace for subsequent 
improvement of the troop combat readiness system. Without 
belittling the greatness of the Soviet Army, which despite 
everything managed to wrest victory from the hands of a powerful 
enemy, it was insistently necessary to soberly and impartially 
understand how and why failures were allowed in troop combat 
training on the eve of war, which dictated the enormous losses 
with the beginning of war and loss of strategic initiative. But 
the ancient wisdom that says whoever does not learn from past 
mistakes inevitably is forced to repeat them clearly did no 
good. Strictly speaking, that is just what happened with us 
after the war. Certain prewar concepts which had not proven 
themselves again prevailed. This concerned above all the 
assessment of the role and place of defense in tactical 
training. For a long time it simply was ignored and the most 
difficult mobile forms of defensive operations, the withdrawal, 
battle in encirclement, and repulse of the first and most crafty 
attack of the enemy with the beginning of war were not rehearsed. 
  And combat experience itself sometimes was received in a 
hypertrophied form and instead of benefit sometimes did a 
certain amount of harm to troop field training. Thus, the 
popularization in military history textbooks primarily of 
winning tactical episodes in which Soviet units achieved success 
led in the final account to where a superficial impression about 
battle formed in young officers and the opinion began to 
predominate that it seemingly could be won without particular 
effort and without thorough training. The archaic, stereotyped 
methodology of conducting tactical exercises (especially field 
fire exercises) and thoroughly staged procedures of playing out 
combat episodes, where the sides' actions were assigned and 
rehearsed in advance, contributed to this to no small extent. 
  The striving to present one's activity in a "rosy light" led 
to the predominance of "ostentatious" tactics, where no place 
remained for a display of creative quests either on the part of 
training instructors or on the part of trainees. For example, 
the conduct of a "march" offensive of troops with truly 
hyperbolic rates of advance (80-100 km or more per day) and 
nonstop negotiation of defensive lines and water obstacles (even 
when massive destruction, abatis, inundations, fires, and zones 
of radioactive and chemical contamination were created), which 
took root in the troops during the 1960's and 1970's, 
unquestionably contradicted front experience. 
  At one time G. K. Zhukov cautioned that without the most 
thorough, scrupulous training it was impossible to achieve 
success in an operation or battle.[.sup]33[/] Behind these 
words of the prominent military leader stand the very abundant 
experience of four years of war and hundreds of the most 
difficult battles, defeats and victories. But despite this, in 
tactical problems it became the rule to conduct ground 
reconnaissance hastily, often according to the same type of 
scheme, and to rehearse delivery of fire, interworking, and 
command and control hurriedly, even without having genuinely 
clarified the enemy's fire plan. Often questions of combat, 
technical and logistic support were omitted, seemingly as 
"unimportant." Engineer preparation of terrain was not conducted 
to the full extent. Political work was carried out formally. Of 
course, it would be unjust to reflect the development of tactics 
and the combat training in postwar time only from a negative 
side. Even in stagnant times tactics did not stand still. The 
troops had many highly active, creative generals and officers 
who worked long and selflessly, boldly broke settled canons, 
conducted problems and exercises in an interesting, instructive 
way, fought stereotype and conventionalism, and enriched 
military theory with new provisions. 
  Tactics received a sharp leap in its development with the 
arrival of nuclear missile weapons in the troops. Under 
conditions of genuinely revolutionary changes it was required to 
take a fundamentally new approach to developing forms and 
methods of combat operations, and Soviet military theory 
successfully coped with development of "nuclear tactics." 
Nevertheless, the "renewal boom" largely remained incomplete and 
indeterminate. Things also did not get by without certain costs. 
Under the influence of nuclear weapons, attention toward tactics 
was relaxed, especially toward developing methods of combat 
operations in the course of a conventional war. This also 
retarded its development. And what was important was that the 
era of rapid renewal of the means of warfare did not introduce a 
radical turning point to the psychology of officers' tactical 
thinking--the old tactical yardsticks largely were retained. 
Ground-air, "electronic" battle even with use of nuclear weapons 
was viewed largely in the light of experience of past wars. The 
stereotyped approaches which dominated for many years did not 
disappear into the past. The category of positional 
confrontation, linear forms of warfare, methodism and the 
measured nature of development of battle by no means became 
"museum-piece" procedures of tactics. All of them are in effect 
even to this day in a somewhat modernized form. This emphasizes 
once again that a conservative psychology in military affairs is 
extremely tenacious. 
  Even with the use of nuclear weapons relapses of obsolete 
methodology remained in the process of combat 
training--implantation of the cult of "normative tactics" 
continued. Personnel training took place in the channel of 
monotonous tactical orientation. Regulation, over-organization, 
and fear of deviating from the regulations continued to suppress 
living, innovative thought. Original decisions by trainees, use 
of procedures of stratagem, and misleading the enemy regarding 
one's true intentions were a great rarity. Stagnation had its 
effect even in times of scientific-technical progress. 
Creativeness in tactics did not prevail over banality, daring 
risk over passive caution, or innovation over slavery to routine. 
  Negative processes in combat training without question could 
not have grown to a critical point had democratic traditions not 
been lost at one time in the Soviet military press. It was the 
broad exchange of opinion of command and political personnel in 
pages of the journals VOYNA I REVOLYUTSIYA, VOYENNAYA MYSL, 
MEKHANIZATSIYA I MOTORIZATSIYA RKKA and VOYENNYY VESTNIK and in 
the newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA and discussions held regularly in 
the 1920's that largely contributed to a proper orientation of 
military cadres and their development of views on such 
fundamental questions of military organizational development as 
the development of fundamentals of military doctrine and a 
determination of ways of accomplishing military reform and 
improving combat readiness of the Army and directions of 
development of strategy, operational art and tactics. It was not 
by chance that Soviet military art made a sharp spurt in its 
development specifically in those years. Evidence of this was, 
for example, development of the theory of deep battle and 
operation. But the subsequent banishment of lively discussion 
and creative thinking and the actual removal of the broad Army 
public from polemic discussion of military problems in the pages 
of the press dealt an especially heavy blow to tactics, which 
well-known Soviet military leader A. I. Yegorov aptly called 
"all-Army creative work." 
  Experience showed that tactical thought is bold and sharp 
and 
is in full swing when nourished by the life-giving juices of 
troop practice and filled daily and hourly with new ideas coming 
from the troops, from the lower strata. It inevitably withers if 
it loses vital contact with its creative aktiv, officers of the 
tactical echelon. But despite this well-known thesis, at one 
time primary attention in upgrading tactics was focused on 
directive instructions. Of course, theoretical and practical 
science conferences were held in the troops and in higher 
military educational institutions, but even here a biased nature 
and intolerance for "different thinking" were manifested. They 
were held basically to substantiate provisions of regulating 
documents and the statements of authorities. A pluralism of 
opinions usually was blocked even in the press, and if bold, 
out-of-the-ordinary thoughts were expressed, as a rule they were 
not heeded. The fact that during the last four and one-half 
decades not one broad discussion of problems of tactics has been 
held in pages of the press eloquently attests to the damping of 
creative searches. 
  It stands to reason that one cannot help but take into 
account the specifics of military service. In military affairs 
it is extremely important to have unified views, unified 
approaches and norms for fundamental issues. Herein lies the 
great importance of doctrinal lines and the consideration of 
demands and principles of military art developed by 
centuries-old practice. Herein is manifested the organizing, 
disciplining role of regulations, manuals, instructions, orders 
and directives. But excessive centralization and the attempt to 
establish full "like-mindedness" in tactics are just as harmful 
as lack of a system. If everything is decided by direction from 
above, then the "lower strata" are left with nothing else other 
than to await instructions of higher commanders. There where the 
practice of awaiting "innovation with the stamp of approval of 
higher-ups" has been established, officers inevitably form a 
contemplative psychology, creative activeness dies out, and 
tactics, which is the bearer of everything foremost and new, in 
the final account turns into a preserve of inertness and lack of 
initiative. 
  Stagnation in tactics also was facilitated to no small 
extent 
by the fact that for a long time it "took a back seat" in our 
leading journals and military-theoretical and 
military-historical works. A gap was created between strategy, 
operational art and tactics, and this could not help but tell on 
development of military theory and practice and on the general 
state of troop combat readiness. There are numerous examples of 
this. For example, the rubric "Formation Tactics" appeared in 
VOYENNAYA MYSL only in the early 1980's. Before this evidently 
it was believed that tactical questions were too "petty" to be 
considered in a military-theoretical journal. In this connection 
I foresee the objection that there is a special journal, 
VOYENNYY VESTNIK, which is tactical in purpose, for this. Yes, 
this is so, but one only has to look carefully at the subject 
matter of articles in this journal and it becomes clear that its 
writings are strictly of an applied nature and are designed 
chiefly for the lower tactical echelon--platoon, company and 
battalion commanders. Other journals and newspapers also rarely 
come out with problem-oriented tactical articles, but the fact 
is that they could influence formation of new tactical thinking 
in officers and "agitate" thought more actively with 
"provocative" polemical writings. 
  Extremely few books on tactics are being published. Never 
before in the entire history of our Army has the officer's 
library been so bare as now. The first military-theoretical 
work, "Taktika" [Tactics], appeared only after 20 years had 
passed since the end of the Great Patriotic War (1966) and had a 
very limited printing. Only a total of three editions of this 
book came out in postwar times.[.sup]34[/] 
  We will note that too few constructive ideas and innovative 
thoughts are advanced in published works on tactics. Theory of 
tactics does not always act as a driving oscillator of 
perestroyka processes. The era of the cult of personality and 
stagnation implanted "normative" thinking in many officers and 
led to depreciation of theory. Many textbooks were written as if 
"using carbon-paper," in a formal style. Provisions of 
regulations are retold in them according to the same type of 
scheme. Often they do not discuss any kind of genuine tactical 
art. 
  Dogmatic restrictions, fear of going beyond the bounds of 
customary ideas, banality instead of originality, tedious 
rehashing of common truths, and calloused thoughts--those are 
the main things that dictated the creative sterility in military 
theory and the deafness to innovation. This difficult heritage 
of stagnation will drag military affairs backward like a heavy 
weight for a long time yet if a resolute struggle is not put up 
against it. 
  The insufficiently high level of scientific achievements in 
tactics largely is determined by an absence of fundamental 
military-theoretical research in prospective problems of combat 
readiness. Primacy was given to current, strictly applied, 
"momentary" interests. No works appeared here in postwar years 
that were equal in theoretical depth, boldness and scale of 
posing questions to such works as "Novoye v razvitii taktiki 
Krasnoy Armii" [New Things in Development of Red Army Tactics] 
by M. N. Tukhachevskiy, "Mozg armii" [Brain of the Army] by B. 
M. Shaposhnikov, "Kharakter operatsiy sovremennykh armiy" 
[Nature of Operations of Modern Armies] by V. K. Triandafillov, 
"Obshchaya taktika" [General Tactics] and "Ogon, manevr, 
maskirovka" [Fire, Maneuver and Maskirovka (lit. "camouflage", 
however, includes "concealment" and "deception" -- FBIS)] by A. 
I. Verkhovskiy, and others. But the fact is, these works 
appeared just 5-10 years after the birth of the Red Army. 
  The circumstance that we practically ceased to publish 
military-theoretical works of foreign authors beginning in the 
1960's did much damage to development of the theory of tactics. 
New works that appear on the whole remain unnoticed in journals 
and newspapers, and annotations and reviews are not even 
provided on them. But despite extremely limited capabilities in 
prewar years, there were many publications of foreign military 
literature. These were works by Machiavelli, Napoleon, von 
Clausewitz, Jomini, Delbruck, Foch, Kuhlmann, 
Fuller, 
Langlois and others. 
  It follows from the above that at the present stage in 
theory 
and practice of military art and in questions of troop combat 
readiness a need arises to rethink and reassess a great deal in 
light of the increased demands of the time and changes in the 
material base of warfare. Not simply "cosmetic cleansing" is 
needed, but fundamental perestroyka for many positions and a 
search for new approaches and fundamentally new solutions. It 
would appear that above all it is important to sharply elevate 
the social status of military theory and genuinely (not in 
words, but in fact) give full play to innovative scientific 
thought. It is perverse and inadmissible to set theory and 
practice in opposition and to calculate in percentages how much 
there should be of theoretical classes and how much of 
practical, let alone in higher military educational 
institutions. Theory must "be present" in literally every class. 
It is impossible to resolve any practical question without this 
"searchlight of scientific thought." 
  In an impetuous time of scientific-technical progress it is 
pernicious to reduce the role of theory only to registering 
events and interpreting provisions of regulations. Military 
affairs mean dynamism, constant uniqueness, destruction of 
stereotypes and established postulates, a continuous search and 
confirmation of new things, and the bold rush of thought into 
the future. Even the most radical changes in the 
material-technical base of battle cannot automatically, of 
themselves, lead to the appearance of new forms and methods of 
combat operations, to the establishment of new tactical 
thinking. The greatest importance in this belongs to a theory 
unswaddled by any lines, free of a biased approach and of 
pressure from above. Under present conditions it must develop a 
scientific concept of perestroyka in the troop combat readiness 
system. Without theoretical study, all practical conditions in 
upgrading the system will be done blindly, by guesswork. 
  A need has matured to infuse a new spirit into tactical 
training methodology, especially in higher military educational 
institutions. It is advisable to teach officers not tactics, but 
the art of tactics, to teach them not decisionmaking 
for battle, but the art of making such a decision, 
and so on. The fundamental difference is that with the new 
methodology the principal goal of training is not to learn the 
work scheme of a commander and staff officer in a combat 
situation, but teach them to creatively analyze, compare, 
foresee the development of combat events, find ways out of 
difficult situations, display aggressiveness, employ procedures 
of deception and stratagem, and strive for victory by means of 
skill. In this connection there is increased importance of 
problem-exploration methods of holding classes and giving 
lectures, of use of mathematical models of the engagement or 
battle, of "atypical games," of problem solving by the 
"brainstorming" method and so on. 
  Military-historical science plays an important role in 
upgrading the combat readiness system. It must "work" more for 
the present. The time has come for military historians to shift 
to a new, higher stage of scientific disclosure of the very 
abundant Great Patriotic War experience, to a detailed 
comparison of belligerents' plans with the involvement of new 
archive sources, to a profound comprehension of events, to a 
demonstration of what kind of troop losses resulted from 
miscalculations and insufficiently considered decisions, and to 
an analysis of how many commanders and staffs managed to win 
victory over superior enemy forces thanks to tactical 
proficiency. A quality research work on the development of 
military art in local wars, and above all on experience of 
combat operations in Afghanistan, is very necessary. It is 
important to deeply comprehend the combat experience gained in 
this war and learn instructive lessons from it, especially in 
fighting in the mountains and improving reconnaissance, physical 
and psychological training of personnel. 
  It should be noted that the work of analyzing and using 
combat training experience in order to upgrade combat readiness 
still is unsatisfactory. Each year a large number of various 
exercises are held in the troops, but their results are not 
properly generalized and, most important, are not communicated 
to the troops and higher military educational institutions. A 
strange practice has formed: While it is the practice to have an 
analytical survey of the experience of operational-tactical 
training of armies of the United States and NATO in pages of 
central military journals, our own combat training experience 
goes ignored. It is not accessible to the broad Army public. It 
turns out that such truly invaluable scientific capital--on 
which, by the way, no small amounts are spent--does not produce 
a proper practical return for improving combat training and 
combat readiness, often disappears in the archives without a 
trace and does not receive new life in textbooks and training 
manuals. But the fact is, this is first-rate "building material" 
for combat improvement of troops and for military theory. 
  In the final account the job of radically improving combat 
readiness never will budge decisively until the entire broad 
Army public joins in a discussion of pressing problems in pages 
of the press and wages a resolute struggle against obduracy, 
slavery to routine and stagnant phenomena. The revival of 
democratic traditions in the press and broad discussion are the 
main line that will help get to new milestones faster in 
training troops and in military organizational development as a 
whole. Only in the light of polemics, by collective reason, is 
it possible to develop faster and better the correct line for 
forward movement and avoid a repetition of mistakes. We have 
more than enough bright, talented officers who are bold in 
opinions and actions. It is important only to arouse their 
creative activeness in the right way and resolutely cast off the 
fetters of irrational limitations and dogmatism. The most 
dangerous enemy in military affairs is stereotype. Until it is 
gotten rid of, one need not speak of any kind of perestroyka. 
  One of the important tasks in upgrading combat readiness is 
increasing the personnel's morale and fighting qualities. Never 
in the past has the factor of morale played such a determining 
role in accomplishing missions facing the troops as at the 
present stage. Commanders and all officers of command and 
control entities should spare no efforts to tirelessly form in 
soldiers a high ideological conviction and devotion to the 
Motherland, persistently instil in them moral qualities, 
internationalism and comradely mutual help, and develop a 
striving for tireless combat improvement, staunchness of spirit, 
selflessness, heroism and the ability to overcome difficulties 
of life in the field. It is important to remember that entry 
into a mortal clash with the enemy and the transition from 
peacetime to combat life is an enormous test of 
moral-psychological qualities. A soldier can learn weapons well 
and learn to use them skillfully, but if he has no inner 
readiness for actions, appropriate ideological conditioning, and 
emotional and volitional stability and is not constantly 
mobilized for fighting, he may not hold up, may waver in a 
minute of a very difficult combat ordeal and thereby endanger 
himself, his comrades in arms and his subunit. Today as never 
before it is necessary for the concepts of a "knowledgeable," 
"skilled" soldier to merge as one with the concepts of "brave" 
and "courageous." 
  To this end, in days of peacetime combat training, in the 
course of problems, drills and exercises, it is necessary to use 
all opportunities to temper a soldier's will and develop in him 
the character of a fearless warrior, self-control, and readiness 
to perform the assigned mission at any cost right up to 
self-sacrifice. Great experience has been accumulated in the 
troops in this matter and it must be used, enriched and 
developed in every way. The tested way of psychological 
conditioning is to move into the assault following the bursts of 
friendly artillery and mortar rounds and bombs, be rolled over 
by tanks, operate tanks underwater, throw live grenades, 
negotiate live-fire assault courses and so on. 
  Problems containing elements of danger and risk permissible 
in peacetime and strictly controlled by the commander prepare 
the personnel for real conditions of war, reinforce their 
professional expertise and increase combat effectiveness. 
  One of the most responsible sectors of work to improve 
combat 
readiness is comprehensive strengthening of discipline and 
efficiency and the establishment everywhere in subunits of 
strict regulation order and the personnel's compliance with 
demands of the military oath, regulations and the commander's 
orders. An old truth goes that without discipline there is no 
combat effectiveness and combat readiness, and there is no army. 
Now, when weapons and the character of battle have become 
immeasurably more complicated and when conditions for performing 
combat missions have become more difficult, the role of 
discipline as a very important factor has grown by many times. 
Lack of discipline even of one soldier, the sluggish, imprecise 
execution of one's duties and of commanders' orders and 
instructions, and a deviation from provisions of regulations in 
battle can lead to serious consequences right up to nonexecution 
of the combat mission by the entire subunit. In days of 
peacetime combat training and day-to-day service the personnel 
must be brought up in a spirit of faultless execution and 
implicit obedience. Any violations of regulation order and 
discipline, indulgences on the part of commanders, and absence 
of proper exactingness toward subordinates are impermissible. 
  Today we clearly realize that there are many difficult 
questions and unresolved problems in matters of upgrading combat 
readiness, but necessary premises for real changes already are 
being created. 
<H5>  Conclusions and Recommendations </H5>
  1. This work considers the importance of the principle of 
combat readiness from two aspects: Theoretical and practical. 
From the standpoint of theory this work shows how the content of 
the "combat readiness" concept "evolved" under the influence of 
development of means of warfare, changes in views on the nature 
of war, the operation and battle, and methods of their conduct. 
The conclusion should be drawn on a practical plane that demands 
of the principle are strictly immutable: It is necessary for 
troops always to be on guard and fully armed to repel 
aggression. War does not forgive blunders and indulgences in 
combat readiness. Here there are none of those trivial matters 
and secondary details which could be ignored; here everything is 
important and everything must be taken into account. 
  2. Demands on combat readiness have increased immeasurably 
under present conditions. There should be no place for 
seasonality in it. Combat readiness must be maintained at a 
proper level at any time of year and day. The factor of time 
plays a deciding role in it. Nothing can make up for the loss of 
time. It can result in loss of people and the initiative. Time 
periods for taking steps to transfer units and subunits to 
higher conditions of combat readiness now are figured not in 
weeks and not even days, but in hours and minutes. 
  3. High combat readiness of troops is forged gradually and 
imperceptibly, day in and day out, by the strenuous labor of all 
personnel. Military theory develops the reference points in its 
improvement, the ideology, the direction of combat training, the 
improvement in the command and control system and the other 
components making it up. 
  4. Measures for maintaining combat readiness of units and 
subunits in peacetime should be conducted purposefully based on 
conditions of the initial period of war as applied to that 
theater of military operations where they are stationed. All 
personnel, right down to every soldier, should know precisely 
what mission is to be executed and how it is to be executed in 
case a military threat builds up or with the beginning of combat 
operations. They should learn the probable enemy's weapons and 
tactics thoroughly, know his strong and weak sides, and in a 
critical situation of aggression which has begun be capable of 
wresting the initiative of actions from the enemy's hands and 
imposing one's own will on him. Only those troops will be able 
to fight in a modern way and repel the attack of a strong enemy 
who master all forms and methods of warfare to perfection in 
peacetime, learn to use the attack, maneuver and protective 
qualities of weapons and combat equipment with maximum 
effectiveness, prove capable of accomplishing missions arising 
suddenly in battle, and can if necessary quickly restructure 
their tactics, develop effective methods of combating previously 
unknown enemy weapons, actively counter his new tactics and 
impose their own will on him. 
  5. It is important to remember that strengthening combat 
readiness is work both of today and for the future. It is 
necessary to take into account not only what the probable enemy 
has now, but also what weapons he will have tomorrow and how his 
battle tactics and conditions of the military situation in 
general can change. Therefore it is necessary to upgrade combat 
readiness with an eye to the long term and with profound 
foresight, it is necessary to resolutely cast aside everything 
that is obsolete and boldly seek out and introduce to practice 
everything new and progressive. Sober realism, precise 
understanding of new problems, boldness backed up by strict 
calculation, rejection of formed stereotypes of thinking, and 
the most profound conviction as to the exceptional significance 
of this very important task are what should permeate the 
activity of military cadres in further comprehensive improvement 
of troop combat readiness. 
  6. The center of gravity in work of strengthening combat 
readiness should be shifted to practical work directly in 
battalions and companies. Organizing execution and implementing 
the orders and directives of senior commanders, one's own 
decisions, and combat readiness plans are the important thing in 
officer cadres' work to improve combat readiness. This requires 
precise assignment of missions, considered disposition of 
people, their purposeful training and principled exactingness. 
Upgrading organizational work to increase combat readiness 
presumes the ability of command personnel to identify the 
important thing, correctly distribute the time budget and 
resources, mobilize people and organize effective control. 
  7. One of the responsible tasks which rests with commanders 
for ensuring subunit combat readiness is their ability to 
organize proper upkeep and maintenance of weapons and combat 
equipment and to ensure their constant readiness for immediate 
use. Every serviceman must know his weapon well, comply with 
rules for maintaining it under field conditions, and promptly 
identify and remedy malfunctions. 
  8. A flexible command and control system is an important 
component element of combat readiness. Effective use of the 
combat capabilities of units and subunits with the beginning of 
war and in its course depends largely on mobility in leading 
them. The demand of the time is such that combat readiness of 
command and control entities in peace and wartime should be one 
step higher than combat readiness of subordinate troops. 
  9. The field is the genuine academy of troop combat 
proficiency. Only in field problems, in a difficult situation, 
is military proficiency forged, combat maturity of commanders 
and staff officers achieved, their will tempered, command and 
control skills improved, and necessary combat and 
moral-psychological qualities and the ability to staunchly 
endure the hardships of life in the field acquired. A subunit 
whose officers and all personnel are unable to live in the field 
as in combat and who are not trained to quickly arrange housing 
and rest for themselves, prepare food, strictly comply with 
rules of personal hygiene, and constantly preserve cheerfulness, 
endurance, and readiness to enter battle at any moment cannot be 
deemed combat ready.

  The fact that the initiative has been seized in 
itself "proves superiority either in quantity or quality of 
troops or in the art of field generalship, and maintains the 
soldiers' morale in all failures and retreats..." 
  F. Engels 
<H3>  1. From the History of the Origin and Development of the 
Principle of Decisiveness and Aggressiveness </H3>
  If we trace the activity of great field generals beginning 
from ancient times up to the present, then despite the specific 
nature of each one's manifestation of military art, nevertheless 
it also appears possible to single out a certain trait of their 
activity common and similar to all. It consists of the ability 
to act resolutely, forcefully and aggressively in the engagement 
and battle. 
  Sun Tzu called decisiveness the supreme art of waging war. 
He 
believed it was possible to frustrate enemy plans through 
decisiveness and daring. He set forth his own rules on how to 
achieve decisiveness and aggressiveness as follows: "If you have 
ten times more forces than the enemy, surround him from all 
sides; if you have twice the forces, split him into parts; if 
forces are equal, be able to engage him in battle; if forces are 
fewer, be able to defend against him; if you have something 
generally worse, be able to evade him..."[.sup]2[/] 
  There is a great distance between what is desirable and what 
is possible in battle. Tens on hundreds of possible obstacles 
arise before the military leader on the path to achieving his 
goal. In entering a clash against the enemy, each time he 
experiences doubt as to whether or not everything has been taken 
into account, whether or not everything has been weighed in 
preparing the battle, whether or not everything has been done as 
necessary to achieve success. Vacillations in decisionmaking are 
inevitable. Therefore it is not enough to possess a brilliant 
mind, the gift of foresight, and organizing qualities; one also 
has to be capable of displaying enormous will in order to cast 
aside all contradictions and be able to implement with supreme 
persistence a decision which has been made. 
  Decisiveness and persistence are not synonyms for 
stubbornness and thickheadedness. Acting decisively does not 
mean stopping at nothing and striving for success at any cost, 
regardless of losses. Decisiveness is that trait of a military 
leader manifested in his ability to act vigorously and boldly 
and at the same time calculatingly and cleverly; to employ 
daring, aggressive methods of fighting a battle, but at the same 
time to skillfully protect himself against any surprises. 
  Displaying decisiveness and aggressiveness cannot be a goal 
in itself; it is only a necessary means for implementing one's 
concepts and plans. Realization of demands of the principle of 
decisiveness and aggressiveness for field generals always has 
been closely intertwined with skillful application of other 
principles--attainment of surprise in delivering an attack, bold 
concentration of efforts, precision of command and control, 
flexibility of interworking, comprehensiveness of support, and 
prudence. In short, decisiveness always acted as a necessary 
condition for implementing demands of all other principles. 
  In describing the campaigns of Alexander the Great into 
Persia and India, Arrian Nicodemus noted that the field general 
achieved decisiveness in striving to force the enemy to take an 
incorrect step and thereby place him in a difficult spot, and 
also to divert attention by decoy and cunning procedures. His 
aggressiveness was manifested in bold, farsighted decisions, in 
the ability to perplex the enemy with uncommonness of actions, 
and in employing unknown means of warfare. For example, 
unexpectedly for the Persians, in the assault on Halicarnassus 
Alexander employed siege equipment which could breach their 
fortress walls. Taking advantage of this, the Macedonians lobbed 
stones, animal corpses and barrels of snakes on the city. After 
inflicting heavy losses on the besieged, they executed a 
decisive assault on the fortress. 
  Thanks to aggressiveness and resourcefulness and to daring, 
surprise actions, the Macedonians managed to take the Persian 
fortress of Tyre. Alexander was not troubled by the circumstance 
that the city not only was protected by fortifications, but also 
was situated behind a vast water obstacle, a strait. He acted 
without delay, ordering a mole to be built across the strait, 
catapults and ballistas set up on it and the city bombarded with 
stones. The unusual assault, aggressive actions and 
unprecedented "infernal machines" all played their role. The 
enemy was broken morally and physically. The action was crowned 
by a concerted assault on the city from different 
sides.[.sup]3[/] 
  In order to achieve decisive actions and stun the enemy, 
Alexander encouraged soldiers' inventiveness and resourcefulness 
in every way and brought in engineers to seek new means of 
supporting battle. His army proved capable of making an assault 
crossing of broad water obstacles in short time periods because 
wineskins inflated with air and wooden boats disassembled into 
parts during transportation were employed as crossing 
equipment.[.sup]4[/] The enemy in no way expected such 
actions and was not ready for resistance. From above, the 
conclusion can be drawn that it is not enough to wish to achieve 
decisive, aggressive actions; one must be able to create 
necessary conditions and favorable premises for this and 
immediately exploit results. 
  Aggressiveness and decisiveness were characteristic traits 
of 
Julius Caesar's field-generalship activity. He used swiftness 
and decisiveness of actions and was able to take advantage of a 
favorable moment to throw the enemy into disarray, to break and 
split his combat formations and hit them in detail. 
  Caesar looked for his own special "key" to success in each 
engagement. Therefore each of his campaigns was dissimilar from 
another both in concept and in methods of achieving 
aggressiveness. In the battle at Pharsalus (48 B.C.) he 
surpassed his enemy Pompey because he acted uncommonly--not like 
everyone, but in his own way. Caesar aligned the combat 
formation in a new way, establishing a reserve of six cohorts, 
which none of the field generals previously had employed. This 
gave him an opportunity to build up his forces at the height of 
the engagement, to act more boldly and forcefully than Pompey 
and impose his own will on him.[.sup]5[/] 
  The decisiveness and swiftness of Caesar's actions played a 
main role during the campaign into Asia Minor, where his army 
smashed a strong army from Pontus in five days. Just like 
Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar made skillful use of engineer 
art to achieve aggressiveness. The Roman Army was able to build 
bridges not only on floating piers, but also on piled piers. We 
know, for example, of a timber pier bridge around 600 m long 
built in ten days across the Rhine River during the campaign 
against the Germans.[.sup]6[/] The high level of engineering 
art during the Roman Empire is attested to by the circumstance 
that each legion's supply train had a certain number of light 
boats with a frame of willow branches covered by 
skins.[.sup]7[/] This enabled the Romans to negotiate water 
obstacles quickly and unexpectedly for the enemy and to 
decisively smash his confused army. 
  Soldiers' resourcefulness and knack, which were the basis of 
the principle of aggressiveness, were inherent to tactics of 
Slavic tribes. Ancient chroniclers noted the high skill, 
decisiveness and resourcefulness displayed in their combat 
operations. In wars against Byzantium (6-7th centuries) they 
showed they had good mastery of siege art. The Slavic army would 
skillfully lure the enemy into a prepared trap, demonstrate 
false retreats, employ abatis and ambushes, and execute raids on 
the enemy from different directions. Portable and mobile screens 
made of brushwood hurdles were used to covertly approach his 
fortified camp, and earth embankments were built. 
  In assaulting fortresses the soldiers would make earth 
mounds 
next to them which they would ascend, then they would cut off 
the paling and set fire to towers and walls of the enemy 
fortress. Much that was new and unexpected for the enemy in 
methods of fighting a battle was employed during the campaign 
into Byzantium in 551 by a 3,000-man Slavic army detachment. 
After making an assault crossing of the Danube River on rafts 
and barrels, the detachment passed through all of Illyria and 
reached the city of Dyrrhachium on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. 
  The decisiveness and scale of actions of the ancient Russian 
Army in the 10th century is attested to by the campaign of 
Kievan Prince Oleg (907) against Tsargrad (Constantinople), 
during which interworking of the land detachment with a 
detachment of vessels (200) was done very successfully. Later, 
2,000 vessels took part in the campaign of Kievan Prince Igor 
(944).[.sup]8[/] Just as with the Greeks and Romans, 
decisiveness and aggressiveness of operations by the ancient 
Russian Army largely were increased by use of various siege 
equipment. Thus, siege machines, iron rams, enormous pieces for 
throwing rocks, and so-called "testudos"--structures covered 
with dry hides--were prepared for taking the fortress of 
Thessalonia. 
  The improvement of weapons and methods of combat operations 
dictated an ever greater diversity of forms and methods of 
achieving decisiveness and aggressiveness in battle. While 
usually relatively small detachments took part in engagements of 
the 10th-12th centuries, the scale of combat operations rose 
substantially during the 14th-16th centuries. For example, in 
the battle against the Golden Horde by Prince Dmitriy of Moscow 
on Kulikovo Field almost 300,000 persons took part on both 
sides. Dmitriy Donskoy's decisiveness of operations in this 
battle was manifested in the fact that he managed to preempt the 
enemy in deploying and delivering an attack (Fig. 1). The 
Tatar-Mongol army under the command of Mamai also acted with 
great determination and aggressiveness in this engagement. But 
in the final account the preponderance was on Dmitriy's side, 
because at the decisive moment he managed to take skillful 
advantage of his general and special reserves to deliver the 
final attack against the enemy, which predecided the battle's 
outcome. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-003LC-29A>             Fig. 1. Battle of Kulikovo </FIG>



  With the appearance of firearms in the 14th-15th centuries, 
decisiveness and aggressiveness of troop operations in battle 
began to take on new forms in connection with the use of fire. 
Although at first the ruchnitsas [hand-held 
harquebus-type firearms] being used by Russian soldiers were 
imperfect, the Moscow, Rostov, Novgorod and other chronicles 
tell, in describing battles in the defense of Moscow (1408 and 
1451), Uglich, Rzhev (1446 and 1447), Galis (1451) and Novgorod 
(1471), that "more than once the enemy was very frightened by 
the firing." 
  The appearance in the Russian Army of the first models of 
guns--tyufyaks--firing shot [grapeshot] played no 
small part in increasing the decisiveness and aggressiveness of 
battle. Use of cannons in defense of fortresses enabled fighting 
off an enemy assault and conducting counterattacks. In wars of 
Rus with Lithuania, Poland, Livonia and the Kazan and Crimean 
Khanates in the latter half of the 15th century and in the 16th 
century, along with the fight for fortresses, field battle began 
to be employed more and more widely in which the Russian Army 
found ever newer tactical methods of operations. Thus, in 1530 
Russian druzhinas for the first time used mobile field 
fortifications made of wood and shields with firing ports, the 
so-called gulyay-gorod. Using the mobile shelter 
enabled inflicting losses on an enemy from short range by fire 
from harquebuses and guns and also by fire from bows. As soon as 
the enemy combat formation managed to be breached, the cavalry 
would join the action, completing the enemy's defeat by a 
surprise attack. 
  When more powerful cannons called treskotukhas and 
barsy became operational during the Livonian War 
(1558-1583), an opportunity appeared to engage the enemy not 
only in close battle, but also from a distance of more than 1 
km.[.sup]9[/] The long-range (distant) firefight originated 
as a result. The Russian Army's achievement of high combat 
aggressiveness was facilitated by the soldiers' combat 
qualities, staunchness, valor, selflessness, love for the 
Motherland and hatred for the invaders. This gave them strength 
in battle and inspired them to exploits. The six-month defense 
of Pskov (August 1581-January 1582) was an example of the 
Russian Army's exceptional staunchness, determination and high 
combat aggressiveness in the defense. The fortress garrison 
numbered 16,000 persons and the city was besieged by a 
50,000-man Polish army headed by King Stefan Batory. But the 
besieged did not sit it out behind fortress walls; they often 
made bold sallies, hampered the enemy's engineer work, inflicted 
losses on him and conducted reconnaissance. The Pskov garrison 
withstood a sum total of 31 assaults, but just did not surrender 
to the enemy.[.sup]10[/] 
  Even longer than Pskov, the garrison of 
Troitsko-Sergiyevskaya Monastery defended 16 months (September 
1608-January 1610) and the Smolensk garrison 20 months (October 
1609-June 1611). What was new in the defense of these fortresses 
from the standpoint of combat aggressiveness were the 
long-distance, rather lengthy sallies by detachments of the 
besieged and decisive counterattacks executed not only during 
the day, but also at night. This enabled keeping the enemy under 
constant stress and wearing him down. Enemy attempts to 
penetrate the fortress through breaches in walls were quickly 
stopped. 
  The principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness found a 
certain reflection in the first Russian "Ustav ratnykh, 
pushechnykh i drugikh del, kasayushchikhsya voyennoy nauki" 
[Manual of Military, Gunnery and Other Affairs Concerning 
Military Science] (1607-1621), written by Onisim Mikhaylov. It 
pointed out that it was necessary to display persistence in 
erecting city fortifications and in their siege. In order to be 
aggressive it was recommended preparing siege assets ahead of 
time. 
  The establishment of permanent armies in a number of 
European 
states was a material precondition which contributed to 
increased decisiveness and aggressiveness of operations in wars 
of the 16th-18th centuries. Being well trained, they had an 
opportunity to conduct field engagements and a more active fight 
for fortresses. Prominent military figures of that time Maurice 
of Orange and Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus played an important 
role in reorganizing their armies and developing new, aggressive 
tactics. 
  In Russia Peter the Great was an outstanding military 
reformer. His views on military art, particularly on the 
principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness, were reflected in 
the treatises "Pravila srazheniya" [Rules of Engagement] (1708), 
"Rassuzhdeniya o dobyvanii Vyborkha" [Reflections on Taking 
Vyborg] (1710) and especially the "Voinskiy ustav" [Military 
Regulations] (1716). These and other documents reflected ideas 
of acting boldly, swiftly and forcefully, but prudently in 
battle, "not be led by the enemy, but constantly keep an eye on 
him and hit him as much as possible." 
  A. V. Suvorov made no small contribution to developing the 
principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness. In an era when 
European armies were dominated by linear tactics, which shackled 
the initiative of commanders and troops like a straitjacket, 
Suvorov developed and brilliantly employed column tactics in 
combination with an extended order--a method of battle created 
in the West only during the Great French Revolution of the late 
18th century and later developed by Napoleon.[.sup]11[/] 
  Suvorov taught: "The true rule of military art is to attack 
the enemy directly from the side most sensitive for him and not 
come together by timidly taking a roundabout way, . . . the 
matter can be resolved only by a direct bold 
offensive."[.sup]12[/] 
  Suvorov set forth basic principles of his aggressive tactics 
especially clearly in the plan for the Italian campaign (1799): 
"1. Nothing but the offensive. 2. Speed in marches, swiftness. 
3. Methodism is not needed, but good visual estimation is. 4. 
Full authority to the commanding general. 5. Attack the enemy 
and hit him in the field. 6. Lose no time in sieges . . . take 
fortresses chiefly by assaults or open force... 7. Never divide 
forces for security of different points. If the enemy went 
around them, so much the better: he approaches in order to be 
defeated. . . . Never occupy yourself with vain 
maneuvers."[.sup]13[/] This was truly a catechism of rules of 
combat aggressiveness. 
  Among western authors who paid greatest attention to the 
principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness were Turenne, 
Montecuccoli, Eugene of Savoy and H. Lloyd. Thus, the "Notes of 
Count Raimundo Montecuccoli..." (1664) stated that initiative 
must be aimed at preempting the enemy, at swiftness, firmness 
and aggressiveness. He recommended not splitting up one's 
forces.[.sup]14[/] Napoleon attached great significance to 
the principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness. Rejecting 
cordon strategy, he believed the principal goal of combat 
operations was not seizure of territory and fortresses, but 
defeat of the enemy army. He said: "I see only one thing--masses 
of enemy troops. I try to destroy them, confident that all the 
rest will collapse together with them."[.sup]15[/] 
  The principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness was 
manifested in the field-generalship activity of M. I. Kutuzov in 
the diversity of methods of strategic and tactical operations 
employed, in the capability of foreseeing how the enemy will act 
in order to take timely steps to constrain his maneuver and 
disrupt his plan, in flexible use of reserves in dangerous 
sectors of the front, in a more rational alignment of combat 
formations, in a broad display of initiative and in granting 
"freedom of initiative" to subordinates. Like Suvorov, Kutuzov 
took skilled advantage of the Russian soldier's combat 
qualities, resourcefulness, sharpness and stratagem. 
  Before a battle Kutuzov would inspire the soldiers, and they 
would display supreme decisiveness and valor. Here, for example, 
is how a participant of the Battle of Borodino, F. Glinka, 
describes it: "Experience shows that the Russian line that has 
been pierced, cut up, and broken still holds. . . . And even 
when the French penetrated into the rear of our troops, their 
combat formations did not get confused. Dokhturov and Rayevskiy 
decided: If the enemy is behind us, we will turn ourselves 
inside out, we will begin to hit the front ones from the front 
faces and the rear ones from the rear faces."[.sup]16[/] 
  In describing the field-generalship art of Barclay de Tolly, 
many military historians focus attention on his excessive 
caution. But when necessary he also skillfully employed the 
principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness. In setting forth 
his war strategy in a letter to P. I. Bagration on 1 June 1812, 
de Tolly demanded: "...a) hit and destroy a weak enemy; b) avoid 
all decisive engagements with a very strong enemy; c) irregular 
troops must have the enemy in unimpeded view, encircle him from 
all sides, bother him day and night and hamper his supply by 
operating against a line of operations." In an instruction to 
General Platov he directed: "Even in defensive operations an 
chance must not be missed to inflict telling blows on the enemy 
and pound him in detail."[.sup]17[/] 
  K. Marx and F. Engels had high esteem for the 
field-generalship activity of Barclay de Tolly in the first 
stage of war. They noted that he "executed a withdrawal with 
wonderful art."[.sup]18[/] H. Jomini also wrote about this. 
"That withdrawal which the Russian Army made in 1812 from the 
Neman to Moscow over a distance of 240 lieue 
[approximately 1,080 km] without allowing an enemy such as 
Napoleon to put them in disarray or partially defeat them . . . 
should be placed above all others."[.sup]19[/] 
  Jomini noted that the principle of decisiveness and 
aggressiveness should be employed in close combination with the 
principles of concentration of efforts and attainment of 
surprise in operations. "...If military art," he wrote, 
"consists of throwing one's forces at a decisive point, it is 
understandable that the first means for application of this 
principle will be seizing the initiative in operations. Whoever 
has seized this initiative knows in advance what he is doing and 
what he wants: With his masses he arrives at that point where he 
should deliver the blow. Whoever waits, is preempted everywhere: 
The enemy pounces on separate parts of his army; he knows 
neither where the enemy wishes to direct his efforts nor the 
means which he must counter."[.sup]20[/] 
  Also to Jomini's credit in developing this principle is that 
for the first time he extended it not only to the offensive, but 
also to the defense. Jomini correctly pointed out that the 
defense must not be waiting, but aggressive in purpose and must 
include elements of the offensive, i.e., bear an 
offensive-defensive character. 
  C. von Clausewitz called this principle boldness, firmness 
and aggressiveness. He remarked that "theory has no right to 
restrict it by virtue of its legislative power . . . Boldness is 
a creative power. . . . Even foolhardiness, that is boldness 
without an object, is not to be despised. Boldness lends wings 
to the mind and the discernment . . . it is impossible to 
imagine a distinguished General without boldness."[.sup]21[/] 
  Clausewitz set aside just as significant a role for firmness 
in a military leader's activity. He wrote that a commander 
"finds himself in a constant whirlpool of false and true 
information, of mistakes committed through fear, through 
negligence, through precipitation, of contraventions of his 
authority, either from mistaken or correct motives, from ill 
will, true or false sense of duty, indolence or exhaustion, of 
accidents which no mortal could have foreseen."[.sup]22[/] 
And one who takes it into his head to yield to these 
impressions, concludes Clausewitz, will display weakness, he 
will be incapable of firmly defending or of implementing a 
decision. 
  Speaking of decisiveness and aggressiveness, the military 
classic notes that "our basic principle is to view the 
destruction of enemy armed forces as the most important thing 
not only in the entire war . . . but also in each individual 
battle."[.sup]23[/] As we see, Clausewitz's opinion in this 
matter fully coincides with the views of Napoleon. Attainment of 
the principal goal of war, destruction of the enemy, according 
to Clausewitz is achieved only by battle. "Tactical successes in 
war," he wrote, "have a dominating importance."[.sup]24[/] 
This thesis was correct for that time, but now strategic and 
operational echelons have their own very effective means of 
warfare which are not part of formations. Therefore the role of 
tactics and the battle should be viewed in a different manner, 
in the overall system of operations and engagements. 
  In analyzing the experience of wars of the late 18th and 
19th 
centuries, one can be convinced as to what major role the 
steadily increasing firepower played in the change in content of 
the principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness. Adoption of 
firearms with a curved stock, which made aimed fire possible, 
played a very important role in this matter. A transition from 
column tactics to extended order tactics occurred in the 
Crimean, Franco-Prussian and Russo-Turkish (1877-1878) Wars, 
which gave the offensive greater penetration and dynamism and 
increased mobility. The aggressiveness of the defense also 
increased and field defense originated. To reduce losses from 
aimed fire and increase the stability of defending troops, in 
addition to building earth-fill fortifications (redoubts, 
fl&egrave;ches, lunettes) they began digging group emplacements 
(logements) and building protective cover and shelters for 
reserves. The importance of engineer preparation of terrain rose. 
  Russian military theorists of the 19th century promptly 
identified the new trends in development of the principle of 
decisiveness and aggressiveness. This was reflected in 
particular in military works by Decembrists P. Pestel, N. 
Muravyev, I. Burtsov, F. Glinka and others. Thus, in his work 
"Russkaya pravda" [Russian Truth] P. I. Pestel noted that 
"success of a military battle . . . depends on decisive 
action..."[.sup]25[/] He linked this both with the force of 
weapons as well as with the Russian soldier's combat qualities. 
D. Davydov, a courageous partisan of the Patriotic War of 1812, 
expressed many instructive thoughts with respect to increasing 
decisiveness and aggressiveness. He developed tactics of 
partisan warfare. Fervent patriot Davydov believed in Russia's 
strength and might and in the valor of the Russian soldier. It 
is to him that belong the prophetic words: "Russia has never yet 
risen to its full gigantic height, and woe to its enemies should 
it rise at some time!"[.sup]26[/] 
  The principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness can be 
traced through the works of G. A. Leyer and M. I. Dragomirov. 
"The very worst thing on which one can decide in war," wrote 
Leyer, "is not to decide on anything."[.sup]27[/] Many 
provisions expressed by Dragomirov regarding the principle of 
decisiveness and aggressiveness are in keeping with these 
thoughts of Leyer. He wrote in the "Uchebnik taktiki" [Tactics 
Textbook] that the one who wins is the one who "has the ability 
to make up his mind for combat undertakings without the 
slightest vacillation . . . and only one who does not fear 
perishing wins. . . . One incapable of making up his mind on 
something is like a person with tied hands with whom anyone can 
do what he likes. . . . The most ill-thought out undertaking 
does not present such a risk as indecisiveness."[.sup]28[/] 
  In wars of the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries--Spanish-American (1898), Anglo-Boer (1899-1902) and 
Russo-Japanese (1904-1905)--rifled longarms were used in 
considerable numbers; their combat capabilities had increased by 
almost tenfold compared with the Model 1808 smoothbore shoulder 
arm. Combat capabilities of artillery had increased 3-4 times. 
Machineguns began to be used on the battlefield for the first 
time.[.sup]29[/] In forecasting the influence of more 
advanced means of warfare on the content of principles of 
tactics, many military theorists concluded that from now on fire 
would displace hand-to-hand combat more and more. 
  This thought was expressed rather precisely by A. A. 
Neznamov, who wrote: "Decisive success in a modern engagement is 
based on attaining a preponderance of fire; silent weapons have 
faded into the background."[.sup]30[/] From an assessment of 
the factor of fire he draws the conclusion that under its 
influence the intensity and aggressiveness of combat operations 
will increase and tactical pauses will shorten. He noted: "The 
time is past in a war when people fought for weeks but waited 
for months."[.sup]31[/] 
  Works by Neznamov and other authors noted a trend toward 
substantial changes in confrontation of the offensive and 
defense under the influence of development of means of warfare. 
While confrontation of the offensive and defense had the nature 
of a confrontation of strength before the appearance of firearms 
and was accomplished in the form of a brief clash of close-order 
infantry or cavalry masses where the outcome of the battle 
depended on the force of soldiers' physical attack, with the 
appearance of firearms belligerents received the opportunity of 
exerting influence on each other at a distance, as a result of 
which troop losses increased and their determination in holding 
positions and their aggressiveness and decisiveness in the 
offensive rose. Fire began to act as the principal "motive 
force" in upgrading forms and methods of preparing and 
conducting combat operations. 
  This was manifested very clearly in the Russo-Japanese War, 
in which new offensive battle tactics were employed under 
conditions of strengthened rifle-machinegun and artillery 
firepower. Decisiveness was reflected in an increased proportion 
of night battles and employment of certain new means of warfare. 
The resourcefulness and inventiveness of Russian soldiers and 
officers were of great importance in increasing combat 
aggressiveness. Thus, in the defense of Port Arthur a method was 
found for throwing round sea mines from fortress fortifications 
into the assaulting Japanese infantry. Hand grenades also were 
used successfully. The world's first models of mortars were 
created with a range of fire up to 500 paces, and the first 
bomb-throwers for firing a six-inch (152-mm) bomb were designed. 
Siegecraft and countermine warfare was employed rather widely. 
  Changes in the nature of battle, its increased duration, 
intensity and spatial scope, and the increased complexity of 
command and control of subunits with the use of thinned extended 
lines on the battlefield sharply increased the role of 
independent actions of initiative by commanders at the tactical 
level. Subsequently this was reflected in the "Ustav polevoy 
sluzhby russkoy armii" [Russian Army Field Service Regulations] 
published in 1912. It instructed: "Every commander and 
rank-and-file soldier is granted independence in executing his 
assigned mission. He should display his own initiative in 
actions in conformity with situation changes if this is 
necessary for achieving a common cause, without awaiting an 
order to himself from the senior commander." 
  Attention also should be given to the fact that the 
aforementioned Regulations included a section on the meeting 
engagement for the first time. This occurred under the influence 
of Russo-Japanese War experience. Prior to this war, neither 
regulations of the Russian Army nor of other European armies 
gave any instructions regarding its conduct. The Russian 
"Nastavleniye dlya deystviya v boyu otryadov iz vsekh rodov 
oruzhiya" [Manual for Actions in Battle by Detachments of All 
Combat Arms] (1904) had only the most general instructions on 
this question. The meeting engagement was viewed as a rare, 
chance phenomenon. Troops did not study this kind of combat in 
exercises and maneuvers. Therefore the circumstance that 
numerous major meeting engagements occurred during the 
Russo-Japanese War in a vast space between the rivers Huanho and 
Shaho in October 1904 was a great surprise to the Russian 
command. Both sides attempted to take the initiative into their 
hands and deprive the enemy of freedom of actions by an assault 
on a selected axis with superior forces. But just like his 
enemy, General Oyama, General A. N. Kuropatkin displayed 
indecisiveness. He extended troops across a broad front out of 
fear of envelopment of the flanks. 
  Conditions for executing a bold maneuver, delivering attacks 
against the enemy flank and rear, and executing surprise close 
and deep envelopments were repeatedly created in meeting 
engagements. But, trained to act only on orders from above, the 
commanders in many cases missed an opportunity for decisive 
actions. 
  Russo-Japanese War experience with respect to development of 
the principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness was reflected 
in field manuals of the Russian and other European armies 
published prior to World War I. The aforementioned Russian 
"Ustav polevoy sluzhby" [Field Service Regulations] (1912) gave 
the main attention to offensive battle. They pointed out: "An 
attack on the enemy serves as the most effective means for 
defeating him." At the same time the Regulations did not deny 
the importance of the defense and recognized a transition to the 
defense to be necessary when the assigned goal could not be 
achieved by the offensive. The Regulations demanded that the 
defense be aggressive and end with the launching of an 
offensive: "In defending, one must strive by all methods and 
means to place the enemy in disarray by fire and, having 
undermined his morale, launch an offensive and defeat him." The 
Regulations paid attention to battle at night and in the 
mountains. But it had no provisions about the need for 
conducting artillery preparation prior to an assault, which was 
taught by Russo-Japanese War experience. Despite certain 
shortcomings, the Field Service Regulations were the best in 
Europe at that time. The German "Infantry Drill Regulations" 
took poor account of the influence of fire. It demanded that the 
infantry attack continuously and move at full height without use 
of the terrain and without digging in. The French "Infantry 
Drill Regulations" (1904) underestimated the increased 
importance in battle not only of artillery, but also of rifle 
and machinegun fire. In the offensive the Regulations provided 
for deploying the infantry into an extended line with an 
interval only of one pace between fighting men. 
  It should be said that the defense was underestimated in 
many 
European armies on the eve of World War I. Thus, it was noted in 
the French "Manual for Senior Troop Commanders" (1914) that, 
having returned to its military traditions (having in mind the 
Napoleonic Wars--I.V.), the French Army "does not 
allow another law in conducting operations than the 
offensive."[.sup]32[/] Such a one-sided approach to assessing 
the kinds of combat operations resulted in no small losses for 
armies in the course of military operations. Mistakes made in 
prewar time had to be corrected on the battlefields. 
  The content of the principle of decisiveness and 
aggressiveness underwent substantial changes in wars of the 20th 
century compared with wars of the 19th century. This was 
dictated by the upgrading of armies' technical outfitting and 
means of command and control and support and by increased scope 
of military operations. In the pre-imperialist period offensive 
and defensive operations usually were accomplished within the 
framework of one engagement, which unfolded on relatively 
limited territory and was waged for a short time. For example, 
the Battle of Borodino in 1812 unfolded on a front of around 8 
km to a depth of up to 6 km and lasted only a few hours. 
  In wars of the 20th century the confrontation of offensive 
and defense took on a more determined and intensive nature. Now 
it was carried on in the form of several successive offensive 
and defensive engagements, which began to develop into a new 
form of military actions, the operation. Thus, in the 
Russo-Japanese War the continuous front of battle reached 75 km 
at Liaoyang and 155 km at Mukden. Depth of the engagement 
increased from 2-4 to 25-50 km, and the duration rose from 1-2 
to 10-17 days. Offensive actions were closely combined with 
defensive ones. 
  In subsequent wars the scope of confrontation of offensive 
and defense increased even more, and the content of the 
principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness also was largely 
updated. World War I began with a meeting clash of large masses 
of troops in the Eastern (Russian) and Western (French) theaters 
of military operations. In not one past war had there been such 
a significant number of meeting engagements as in the maneuver 
period of World War I. This was a result of prewar concepts of 
acting only offensively in war in order to win it in short time 
periods. 
  War subjected prewar theories regarding the meeting 
engagement to a very tough test and introduced much that was new 
to methods of its conduct. Combat experience showed that such an 
engagement is distinguished by fluidity, absence of a continuous 
front, and the presence of exposed flanks, and that success is 
attained in it by the one who acts creatively and with 
initiative, who organizes reconnaissance well and who preempts 
the enemy in deploying, opening fire and maneuvering. 
  Aggressiveness was displayed in the defense with 
unprecedented force. Use of rifle-machinegun and artillery fire 
in combination with the building of engineer obstacles, 
fortification of terrain and execution of counterattacks made 
the defense insurmountable for an attacker. The defense managed 
to withstand his striking power even when new means of 
warfare--tanks and aircraft--appeared. Both field position 
defense as well as defense of fortresses was employed 
successfully during the war. 
  The Russian troops' heroic defense of the Osowiec Fortress 
(1915) serves as an example of high staunchness and 
aggressiveness in holding fortresses. It was characterized by 
the fact that the defenders did not passively sit behind 
fortress fortifications, but undertook aggressive actions and 
constantly harassed the enemy with night sallies and delivery of 
counterattacks. 
  The Germans made the first assault on the fortress in 
February, but it was beaten off. Some time later one assault 
followed another over a period of two weeks, but the garrison 
not only did not waver, at every convenient instance it would 
deliver answering attacks. Convinced that the fortress could not 
be taken by assault, the Germans changed tactics--they began an 
exhausting bombardment of the fortress by heavy artillery and 
put 305-mm howitzers into action. The fortress was almost 
totally demolished, but it held out staunchly. After a half-year 
siege, the Germans undertook a gas-cylinder assault. Around 70 
percent of its defenders perished from fire and gases, and still 
the soldiers found the strength to retake positions by 
counterattacks.[.sup]33[/] Defense of the Osowiec Fortress 
was the prototype of Soviet troops' heroic defense of cities of 
Odessa, Sevastopol, Tula and Stalingrad in the Great Patriotic 
War, a symbol of the Russian soldier's supreme staunchness of 
spirit and resolve. 
  Important trends in development of aggressiveness of the 
defense during World War I were the increase in its depth and in 
anti-artillery, antichemical and antitank stability. There was a 
gradual transition from center-of-resistance defense and an even 
infantry distribution in the first line of trenches to trench 
defense with establishment of sturdy strongpoints and fire 
pockets between them (Fig. 2). 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-003LC-34A>             Fig. 2. Alignment of the defense during World War I </FIG>



  Offensive battle tactics were perfected simultaneously with 
development of the defense. An increase in its decisiveness was 
facilitated by the massing of a large amount of artillery in 
breakthrough sectors (160-180 pieces per kilometer of frontage); 
conduct of a powerful, lengthy artillery preparation prior to an 
assault; employment of a gas-cylinder assault in certain 
engagements; the attackers' use of a ramming tank attack to 
breach the enemy defense; an ever increasing buildup of air 
efforts to support attacking troops; conduct of an infantry 
assault following a rolling barrage; and an increased role and 
importance of night battles. 
  But many factors were observed in the course of the war 
which 
reduced effectiveness of the offensive. These were the 
predominance of methodism and linearity in troop actions, 
stereotyped alignment of combat formations and stereotyped use 
of methods of making a breakthrough. Low rates of advance 
resulted. Thus, in the Verdun operation German troops advanced 
at a rate of only 40 meters per day, the Anglo-French on the 
Somme advanced at a rate of 70 meters per day, and only in the 
Amiens operation (1918) for the first time in the entire war did 
the Anglo-French manage to successfully penetrate the enemy 
tactical defensive zone. On the first day they advanced 8 km and 
on the following six days advanced 19 km.[.sup]34[/] 
  On the whole, World War I was a classic example of the 
balance which had formed in the ratio of attack and defense 
means, which led to the sides' lengthy static confrontation. In 
order to find a way out of the positional impasse which had 
formed and give combat operations a decisive character, warring 
armies above all strived to improve their means of warfare and 
create those weapons and combat equipment which would be capable 
of reliably suppressing the defenders' fire plan and providing 
an opportunity for a broad offensive. Tanks and aircraft were 
these means, but they did not decisively influence the overall 
nature of military operations because of their poor combat 
qualities and relatively low numbers. As a result, belligerents 
were forced to be on defense for the greater part of the time, 
and only for eight months (altogether) of the overall length of 
the war (more than 51 months) did they conduct aggressive 
offensive operations on a broad scale.[.sup]35[/] 
  Decisiveness and aggressiveness were characteristic features 
of Red Army troop operations in the Civil War in Russia. M. V. 
Frunze noted: "Almost all significant operations of Civil War 
times bear traces of a manifestation of a spirit of 
aggressiveness and initiative on our side."[.sup]36[/] This 
was determined not by quality of weapons (they were the very 
same as in World War I), but by features of combat operations, 
by the absence of continuous static fronts and, most important, 
by the revolutionary enthusiasm of Red Army men and commanders 
and their initiative and innovativeness in employing decisive, 
mobile methods of warfare. 
  All prewar Red Army field manuals and field service 
regulations were imbued with a spirit of aggressiveness, 
decisiveness and offensiveness. Fighting men and commanders were 
required to display initiative, resourcefulness, determination 
and persistence in achieving the goal. Regulations noted that it 
was not the one who did not achieve success in combat despite 
all measures taken who deserved reproach, but the one who, 
fearing responsibility for failure, let the time slip by, showed 
no initiative, and did not take advantage of all opportunities 
for performing the assigned mission. 
  The aggressiveness, decisiveness and offensiveness of troops 
stemmed from the content of Soviet military doctrine, which 
provided for waging war only on enemy territory and defeating 
him "by a powerful blow" in short time periods. The idea of 
winning victory "with little blood" was so attractive that it 
left no place to be concerned with teaching troops to fight the 
lengthy, exhausting, bloody defensive and offensive battles 
characterizing the war which later came unexpectedly. Here we 
see an example of being excessively carried away by a 
decisiveness which did not correspond to a realistic assessment 
of the enemy and of one's own combat capabilities. 
  An attempt by Soviet commanders to act offensively no matter 
what with the beginning of war, as demanded by the supreme 
military leadership, led to enormous, unjustified losses and a 
sharp deterioration in the troops' situation. Therefore 
decisiveness and aggressiveness should not be an end in 
themselves. In the final account Soviet troops learned to 
skillfully apply this principle in the course of battles. As 
Zhukov noted, "all major offensive and counteroffensive 
operations of Soviet troops beginning with the fall of 1942 were 
distinguished by originality, decisiveness, swiftness and total 
completeness."[.sup]37[/] 
  Just what new things did World War II introduce to the 
content of the principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness? 
Above all we will note that the ratio of attacking forces and 
means of defense shaped up differently in this war than in World 
War I. In many operations the attacker succeeded in achieving a 
decisive fire superiority over the defender, which was the 
result of the changed material base of war. Massive employment 
of aircraft, artillery and tanks in operations in combination 
with increased striking power and firepower of formations 
enabled not only making a quick break-in of the enemy defense, 
but also decisively building up the force of the attack by 
commitment of mobile groupings, turning tactical success into 
operational success. 
  But even under these relatively favorable situation 
conditions, demands of the principle of decisiveness and 
aggressiveness were realized in a difficult, intense struggle. 
Commanders and staffs were required to display high proficiency 
in order to surpass the enemy in employing aggressive forms of 
battle, imposing their will on him, and seizing and holding the 
initiative. 
  The belligerents usually found effective methods of 
opposition rather quickly when enemy tactics changed and new 
methods of warfare appeared. For example, in response to a 
strengthening of striking power and penetration of attacking 
troops, trends began to be reinforced in the defense toward a 
transition from a shallow, center-of-resistance defense to a 
continuous, deeply echeloned trench system of building positions 
and zones, which balanced the sides' capabilities. If the 
attacker attempted to increase rates of advance by massive 
employment of tank troops, the defending side would increase its 
capabilities in response by upgrading the antitank defense 
system--establishing antitank strongpoints, centers and areas to 
the full depth not only of the tactical, but also of the 
operational defense. The sides' competition occurred in a 
similar way in building up attacks from the air and reinforcing 
air defense. 
  The main sphere of the sides' opposition in World War II was 
the struggle to win and hold fire superiority. Decisiveness of 
the offensive and attainment of high rates of penetration, 
pursuit, and nonstop crossing of water obstacles by Soviet 
troops largely were ensured by perfection of methods of fire 
damage of the enemy. Use of the so-called artillery and air 
offensive, which provided effective, continuous fire support to 
attacking infantry and tanks to the full depth of combat mission 
performance, played a major role here. 
  But to counterbalance this the German command began seeking 
more effective methods of counterbattery fire and of conducting 
a counterpreparation, and it began employing deceptive 
procedures more widely to covertly remove its subunits from the 
FEBA into the depth on the eve of Soviet troops' artillery 
preparation of an assault. 
  And although the Great Patriotic War experience largely 
enriched the content of the principle of decisiveness and 
aggressiveness and Soviet commanders set brilliant examples of 
skillful realization of the demands of this principle in 
practice, many negative points also were observed. Decisiveness 
and aggressiveness were not always achieved through art and 
cunning. Reliance was placed most often on achieving a multiple 
superiority in personnel and equipment over the enemy. 
Stereotyped procedures and banality sometimes occurred in 
preparing and conducting the battle. Linear, methodical actions 
often prevailed over maneuver. Some commanders' fear of 
responsibility also told at times, which paralyzed a display of 
initiative. 
  The revision of field manuals did not always keep up with 
the 
development of tactics. For example, in prewar times it was 
believed that a platoon or company commander should draw 
subordinates into the assault by personal example and therefore 
was obligated to be in front of the combat formation. In the 
first period of war this led in practice not to increased 
aggressiveness of actions, but to heavy losses of command 
personnel. 
  Or take another example. Prewar Red Army field manuals 
provided for a deeply echeloned alignment of the combat 
formation in the offensive, beginning with the company and 
ending with the division. It was believed that this created 
conditions for decisive forward movement at an increasing rate. 
But at the beginning of the war the German defense was shallow 
and center-of-resistance. Penetrating it did not require having 
such a considerable number of personnel and equipment in second 
echelons and reserves. In practice this led only to excessive 
personnel losses. It often happened that they suffered heavy 
losses from enemy fire even before commitment. 
  What was new in realizing this principle in modern local 
wars 
was the increased power and depth of fire damage of the enemy; 
wide employment of airmobile troops and airborne and amphibious 
assault forces for creating an aggressively operating front in 
the enemy rear and splitting his grouping into parts; a more 
frequent and broader use in battle than before of new 
weapons--napalm, combat helicopters, guided weapons, MLRS, 
automated reconnaissance and command and control equipment, 
fuel-air explosives, new kinds of engineer obstacles and so on. 
  The result of this was an increase in the decisiveness, 
dynamic nature and mobility of combat operations. Military 
analysts have calculated that while the coefficient of combat 
operations intensity during the Russo-Japanese War was 0.2 and 
in World War I (based on the experience of western countries) it 
was 0.46, then in World War II (based on experience of the 
Soviet-German front) it was 0.88. Based on experience of 
contemporary local wars, it is approaching unity.[.sup]38[/] 
It is apparent from this that the role and importance of the 
principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness in battle has had a 
stable tendency to rise in the course of wars. At the present 
stage of development of military affairs, material preconditions 
have been created for development of this trend, which is 
dictated by the outfitting of troops with qualitatively new 
weapons possessing great range, high destructive power, accuracy 
and mobility, as well as by very sophisticated means of command 
and control and support. 
<H3>  2. Principle of Decisiveness and Aggressiveness in Defensive 
Battle </H3>
  High aggressiveness in combination with the troops' 
determination in holding occupied positions is the principal 
condition for achieving defense stability. Combat practice has 
shown convincingly that waiting and passivity are pernicious for 
a defender. Speaking of the importance of aggressiveness and 
initiative in defense, prominent Soviet military leader General 
of the Army A. V. Gorbatov remarked in a conversation with young 
officers that "this is that weapon which you always have, which 
always will help you get out of a difficult spot, even if it 
theoretically turns out that no way out of the situation at hand 
is evident. . . . Let it not frighten you that the enemy is 
highly experienced and refined and that he surpasses you by many 
times in forces. He still is not all-powerful. Think, organize, 
search well, and you definitely will find his vulnerable spot, 
you will discover his blunder, by taking advantage of which you 
can nullify all his efforts or even rout him."[.sup]39[/] The 
value of this advice is immense--it comes from experience. 
  The correlation and interrelationship of the defense and 
offensive have appeared differently in each war depending on the 
level of development of means of warfare. But one also can 
follow the manifestation of a certain general trend in their 
interrelationship. It is that an ever increasing mutual 
penetration of these kinds of combat operations is occurring. 
Points in time arise more and more often in the offensive where 
it is impossible to get by without defense or to advance without 
consolidation on captured lines. Offensive forms and methods of 
operations are being used more and more widely and fully in the 
defense, which increases the decisiveness of its goals. 
  Many military analysts are inclined to conclude from this 
circumstance that this trend will have even more striking 
development in the future. Thus, the authors of the 
military-theoretical work "Taktika" [Tactics] arrive at the 
conclusion that the contemporary defense is acquiring a new 
quality--in contrast to the past, it is receiving an opportunity 
not only of repelling an attack by superior enemy forces, but 
even of disrupting his offensive.[.sup]40[/] This means that 
its decisiveness is increasing sharply. 
  I assume such a conclusion hardly can be deemed 
unequivocally 
indisputable, for the sides' combat capabilities are each 
growing. This means that a manifestation of decisiveness and 
aggressiveness of the defense inevitably will be opposed by the 
attacking side's determined countermeasures. One also cannot 
fail to take into account that the defense as a kind of combat 
operation not only has strong aspects, but also a certain 
vulnerability. Defending troops are significantly dependent on 
the attacking enemy's actions. 
  Just the circumstance alone in choosing the time, place and 
methods of delivering attacks are on the attacker's side; this 
places the defense in an unequal situation with him. To this 
must be added that, as a rule, the attacking side possesses a 
quantitative or even a qualitative superiority. Hence, it 
becomes understandable that the defense is far from always in a 
position to impose its will on the attacker, inasmuch as it 
chronically experiences an acute shortage of personnel and 
equipment. 
  Opposition of the offense and defense always has been the 
motive force of development of military art in all wars. At the 
present stage it is manifested with special vividness. This 
essentially means that it is necessary to seek new forms and 
methods of displaying aggressiveness and decisiveness in battle 
in order to achieve superiority over the enemy. As shown by 
combat experience, in addition to the advantage taken of 
objective factors, much depends here on the tactical 
creativeness of commanders, staffs and troops. 
  We will refer to the Great Patriotic War experience to 
illustrate this thesis. It is common knowledge that the quality 
of weapons and combat equipment did not undergo any substantial 
changes whatsoever during the War, but the results of battles, 
including also in the defense, can be said to have been striking 
in the first and subsequent periods. Thus, while enemy troops 
managed to advance to a depth of 250-270 km in 67 days of 
defensive battles during the Battle of Moscow, they advanced 
only 120-150 km in 124 days in the Battle of Stalingrad. The 
maximum advance of offensive groupings of fascist German troops 
during the defensive engagement at Kursk did not exceed 35 km. 
  The increased stability of defense by Soviet troops in the 
course of combat operations was largely determined by the fact 
that each time the commanders and staffs tried to find ever more 
improved tactics, this contributed to attaining decisive goals 
in battle. Now, when foreign armies, particularly the U.S. Army 
under the "air-land operation" concept, are seeking methods for 
delivering a deep strike in the offensive in order to paralyze 
enemy actions in a short time by taking advantage of the factor 
of surprise (Fig. 3), the defender's mission is to counter the 
attacker with his own more aggressive methods of opposition; to 
not allow combat formations to be broken up laterally and in 
depth; and to disrupt the enemy's ground and air maneuver. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-003LC-38A>             Fig. 3. Essence of the "air-land operation" </FIG>



   Fig. 4 clearly shows the possible forms and methods of 
applying the principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness in the 
defense. Their common characteristic feature is the diversity of 
tactics and the growing role of fire, maneuver and obstacles in 
achieving goals of the defense. And although in terms of 
external characteristics certain methods of conducting a 
defensive battle are indistinguishable from those used during 
World War II, their content has largely been renewed. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-003LC-39A>             Fig. 4. Methods of realizing the principle of </FIG>



  Take for example a well-known method such as successive 
delivery of damage on the enemy as he approaches the FEBA and 
wedges into the depth of the defense. Its difference from the 
past is that the defender now has the capability of more 
actively pressuring the enemy in all stages of his preparation 
of the offensive beginning with his troops' concentration in 
attack positions, during forward movement into the assault, and 
ending with the fight to hold defensive positions. 
  The increased range of weapons contributes to this (Fig. 5). 
Thus, in World War I artillery had a range of fire of 
6,000-9,000 m and in a defense could lay down barrage fire ahead 
of the FEBA and use fire basically to exert an effect on combat 
formations of attacking first-echelon regiments. This only 
partially weakened the attacking troops' offensive potential. 
Therefore, hand-to-hand combat played the main role in repelling 
an enemy assault. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-003LC-40A>             Fig. 5 [caption missing] </FIG>



  In World War II the range of the bulk of artillery increased 
to 9,000-12,000 m, which enabled the defender to keep the full 
depth of the combat formation of attacking enemy formations 
under fire. Fire aggressiveness and stability of the defense 
increased in connection with this. As a result, there was a 
significant increase in the attacker's losses to the fire of 
defending troops. Hand-to-hand combat was used more rarely. 
  Under present conditions the maximum range of weapons of 
combined arms formations, counting combat helicopters and 
supporting aviation, has increased by 4-5 times compared with 
World War II. The depth of fire strikes has increased 
accordingly. For example, based on NATO troop exercise 
experience, fire engagement of the enemy is planned in the 
division defense to a depth of 80-110 km. This means that, using 
its own assets, a formation now essentially is capable of 
continuously exerting a fire effect not only on the enemy's 
tactical reserves, but also on his immediate operational 
reserves and of keeping him under constant tension. 
  When one takes into account that now not only maximum range, 
but also destructive power and accuracy of weapon strikes have 
increased, it becomes obvious that the defender is capable of 
making wider use of the principle of decisiveness and 
aggressiveness to achieve his goals. 
  But this principle is realized especially effectively in the 
case where a deep combination effect is used on an attacking 
enemy from the ground and air. This is a new form of combat 
aggressiveness in the defense dictated by the appearance of such 
weapons as precision weapons, helicopters, EW assets, and 
equipment for remote mining of terrain. The essence of this 
method of defensive battle is to constrain enemy operations to 
the maximum extent, disorganize his command and control, wear 
him down, inflict losses on him, and reduce his offensive 
groupings' rates of advance by fire. The latter is accomplished 
by landing airborne assault forces and raiding and 
reconnaissance units in the enemy rear, by establishing 
defensive fire barriers on his routes of forward movement, and 
by employing massive electronic jamming. We will emphasize the 
important role in attaining these goals played by defensive fire 
barriers, which are created by remote minelaying equipment, in 
combination with massive fire strikes, delivered by 
reconnaissance-strike complexes, reconnaissance-fire complexes, 
MLRS systems, combat helicopters and artillery. 
  One effective method of displaying combat aggressiveness in 
the defense is to deliberately draw the enemy into a planned 
area (fire pocket) and deliver strikes against him from the 
front, flanks and rear. This is essentially also a new method of 
conducting defensive battle. Although a withdrawal of subunits 
from the FEBA into the depth to deceive the enemy sometimes was 
employed in World War II; first of all it was done on a limited 
scale; secondly, it was done very rarely; and thirdly, at that 
time the defender had no opportunity to deliver a combination 
strike against a wedged-in enemy from different directions, 
including also from the rear. 
  Now, as a result of increased firepower and striking power 
and employment of airborne assault forces, combined arms 
formations more often than before can deliberately create fire 
pockets in order to lure the enemy into them and then decisively 
destroy him by massive artillery fire, strikes by aircraft and 
by reconnaissance-strike and reconnaissance-fire complexes, and 
delivery of surprise flanking counterattacks in combination with 
the landing of airborne assault forces in the enemy rear. 
  Forms and methods of displaying combat aggressiveness in 
fighting the enemy on approaches to the defense now have become 
more decisive and diverse. In principle, even in past wars the 
defender tried to exhaust and wear down the enemy to the maximum 
extent back before he launched an assault, but capabilities for 
this were very limited in World War I due to the short range of 
weapons. But it was then that the need arose for establishing a 
shallow (3-4 km) security area ahead of the FEBA which was 
saturated with various obstacles and covered by artillery fire. 
  A tendency to move the battlefield as far forward as 
possible 
beyond the FEBA saw further development in World War II. This 
was manifested in the fact that the depth of the security area 
increased to 10-12 km and its stability also rose, due to the 
fact that it began to have more thorough engineer preparation 
and rather considerable forces were assigned for its defense. 
  A decisive form of fire aggressiveness such as conducting an 
artillery and air counterpreparation against an offensive enemy 
grouping poised for the attack also began to be employed to 
disrupt an enemy offensive. The Soviet command began organizing 
the counterpreparation already in the first defensive operations 
(in June 1941 on the Northwestern axis), but its effect was 
insignificant due to the fact that the enemy grouping had been 
poorly reconnoitered and there was a shortage of artillery and 
ammunition. 
  Approximately the very same thing was repeated in the Battle 
of Leningrad in September 1941 and in the Battle of Moscow. 
Although in the latter instance counterpreparation was prepared 
more thoroughly by the Western Front command, few personnel and 
equipment were involved in conducting it. The counterpreparation 
mission assigned was to disrupt a possible enemy offensive. For 
this it was planned to use artillery fire to suppress and 
destroy his infantry and tanks in concentration areas and at 
attack positions, suppress enemy artillery and disrupt command 
and control. 
  To this end, detailed counterpreparation plans were worked 
out in the armies which envisaged the involvement not only of 
guns, but also of 82-mm and 120-mm mortars. Thus, on 1 and 2 
October 16th Army artillery in the vicinity of Yartsevo 
conducted a counterpreparation three times lasting up to 10 
minutes on a front of 10 km with a density of 30 guns per 
kilometer of front and with an expenditure of 0.3 units of fire. 
Its results could not be determined, since the enemy was not 
attacking on this axis.[.sup]41[/] 
  Artillery counterpreparation was conducted several times 
during the defensive battles at Stalingrad. Its duration usually 
was 40-60 minutes and consisted of 2-3 fire assaults (5-10 
minutes each) and battery fire for suppression. As a result, the 
enemy assault managed to be disrupted on certain 
axes.[.sup]42[/] 
  The experience of conducting an artillery counterpreparation 
in the Battle of Kursk in the defense zone of Central and 
Voronezh fronts deserves special attention. It was set to last 
30-40 minutes. A considerable amount of artillery was involved 
in the counterpreparation. Thus, in 13th Army it reached 1,100 
guns, mortars and combat vehicles, which provided a density of 
36 weapons per kilometer of front. Overall ammunition 
expenditure was specified as 0.25 units of fire. Aircraft took 
part in the counterpreparation. In assessing results of the 
counterpreparation, Zhukov wrote: "It should be said that the 
artillery staffs and all artillery commanders of fronts, armies 
and formations worked well and wisely to organize the artillery 
defense and counterpreparation."[.sup]43[/] 
  Under present conditions opportunities are being created for 
increasing the effectiveness of counterpreparation fire and 
organizing it in shorter time periods. The involvement of 
precision weapons, reconnaissance-strike and reconnaissance-fire 
complexes, a more significant amount of MLRS, and also front and 
army aviation contributes to this. 
  We will note that already in the past war defending troops 
sometimes delivered an attack ahead of the FEBA to exploit 
results of the counterpreparation with the goal of causing 
confusion in enemy ranks, disorienting him with respect to one's 
plans, and reinforcing the effect of the fire strike. 
  Such aggressive actions by defenders can receive wider scope 
under present conditions. For example, sometimes along with the 
delivery of a surprise counterattack against the enemy, it is 
possible to simultaneously land an airborne assault force in his 
rear and organize operations by raiding and reconnaissance 
parties in order to divert or dissipate the attacker's combat 
efforts and weaken or disrupt his attack. 
  Troops may use all forms and methods of aggressive 
operations 
during the battle to hold the main defense area. Main efforts 
are directed above all at holding the FEBA. As is apparent from 
Table 1, decisive disruption of the enemy assault requires 
disabling 50-60 percent of his personnel and combat equipment. 
With the degree of fire damage at 30 percent, there is a 40 
percent probability of the enemy giving up the assault.

  Methods of displaying combat aggressiveness during troop 
defense operations in the main and subsequent defense zones 
depend on the goals set, the sides' force ratio, and other 
situational conditions. In those cases where the mission 
assigned is to firmly hold occupied positions by a stiff 
position defense, fire aggressiveness basically prevails in 
order to prevent a breakthrough of enemy tanks and motorized 
infantry across the FEBA and to isolate the battlefield from an 
influx of his reserves from the depth. A stubborn fight must be 
waged for every strongpoint, hill, and road junction. Every 
meter of enemy advance must come to him with a fight and be 
accompanied by heavy losses. 
  In the past, counterattacks were one of the chief forms of 
displaying combat aggressiveness in conducting a position 
defense. It must be said that in the Great Patriotic War they 
were conducted by Soviet troops very often, but not always 
successfully, especially in the first period of war. 
  Here we are dealing with that case where aggressiveness 
became an end in itself. The sources of this subjectivist 
approach to displaying combat aggressiveness in the defense 
originated in prewar times, when the offensive idea was 
insistently advanced in all regulation documents--crush the 
enemy by a powerful attack in short time periods. For example, 
here is how this concept was interpreted in the prewar textbook 
"Obshchaya taktika" [General Tactics], which noted: "The 
guarantee of victory in the defense is supreme aggressiveness 
and decisiveness of operations, consisting of the troops and 
their commanders unceasingly striving not only to hold up the 
attacker, but also to inflict a crushing blow on 
him."[.sup]44[/] 
  In practice, with the beginning of military operations this 
developed into a situation where our division and regimental 
commanders were forced to act aggressively in accordance with 
the operations plan even in difficult, vague circumstances, when 
the enemy surpassed our troops many times in tanks and 
artillery, and when his aircraft had undivided rule of the air. 
To seize the initiative they would throw the troops against the 
enemy and would organize counterattacks clearly doomed to 
failure. 
  Under present conditions counterattacks by no means have 
lost 
their importance as a method of inflicting defeat on the enemy 
and restoring a lost position. But in making the decision to 
conduct them, we must weigh everything dozens of times and 
calculate what is more advantageous--repulse an assault of enemy 
tanks and infantry by fire from in place or throw subunits out 
to meet him. A counterattack that is insufficiently prepared 
with respect to fire, especially in those cases where the enemy 
has not been halted and has a clear superiority in personnel and 
equipment, can lead to excessive losses and worsen the 
defender's situation. 
  The simplest calculations show that a motorized rifle 
battalion is capable of repelling an assault of up to an enemy 
brigade by fire from in place, while it can rout only a company 
in delivering a counterattack. But this does not mean that one 
should reject counterattacks entirely. This would be incorrect, 
inasmuch as a situation may take shape in battle where it is 
possible to improve the situation at hand only by delivering a 
counterattack. 
  We will dwell in more detail on applying the principle of 
decisiveness and aggressiveness in a mobile defense, as this 
question has been less studied in our military theory. The 
mobile defense largely differs from the position defense in 
goals and methods of attaining them. It is conducted most often 
as a forced measure in a difficult, often critical situation 
against enemy forces that are many times superior. Therefore 
commanders, staffs and troops are required to display special 
skills so that they compensate for an acute shortage of 
personnel and equipment, win time, and exhaust and wear down the 
attacker by delaying actions on a number of lines favorable for 
defense. 
  Forms and methods of aggressive operations employed by 
Soviet 
troops in a mobile defense during the Great Patriotic War were 
not distinguished by great diversity. Units and subunits tried 
to damage the enemy chiefly by fire as he approached the FEBA 
and then, without taking matters to a decisive assault, would 
break contact with him, disengage and withdraw to the next 
defensive line in the depth, where these operations usually were 
repeated. Now the increased fire, attack and maneuver 
capabilities of combined arms formations and units permit 
significantly broadening and enriching tactics being used in 
order to immobilize the attacker's initiative, constantly wear 
him down and disrupt or hamper maneuver by harassing actions, 
and mislead him regarding one's true intentions by means of 
deceptive methods (Fig. 6). 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-003LC-43A>             Fig. 6. Forms and methods of tactical operations </FIG>



  Under present conditions it appears possible to make wider 
use of an effective method of combating the enemy, such as 
ambush operations. Ambushes were employed rather skillfully by 
Soviet troops in the mobile defense even in the Great Patriotic 
War. Thus, in January 1945 subunits of 110th Tank Brigade 
repelled up to ten enemy tank attacks during the day by fire 
from ambushes and thereby supported the withdrawal of 18th Tank 
Corps and its organized transition to a defense northwest of 
Budapest.[.sup]45[/] But at that time ambushes were set up 
primarily in immediate proximity of the FEBA, in gaps, and on 
strongpoint flanks and were insufficiently mobile. 
  Now the aggressiveness of fire ambushes is growing 
considerably in connection with the fact that not only tank and 
motorized rifle subunits can be involved in establishing them, 
but also combat helicopters, IFV's, APC's, ATGM systems, air 
defense systems and self-propelled guns. Helicopter ambushes, 
for example, can be set up on distant approaches to the defense. 
Other kinds of fire ambushes can be established throughout the 
zone or in a sector of the defense. 
  Roving tanks, IFV's, APC's, guns and mortars play an 
important role in increasing the aggressiveness of a mobile 
defense. Their wide, skillful use in a system of ambushes, as 
well as in strongpoints and in the space between positions, 
increases the tenacity and effectiveness of the fire plan and 
helps mislead enemy reconnaissance. Fire pockets may be set up 
in a mobile defense more often than before. Any opportunity is 
used to set them up: A favorable configuration of the front 
line; a gap between strongpoints; approaches to commanding 
heights and populated points; chokepoints; valleys; gorges and 
so on. Essentially all kinds of small arms are used in 
establishing fire pockets. Not only the regimental commander, 
but also every company and battalion commander can set up fire 
pockets with his own personnel and equipment. 
  In addition to fire pockets, an operational pocket can be 
established in an operational-level defense by decision of the 
large strategic formation commander to draw an enemy offensive 
grouping into it and defeat it by delivering surprise flanking 
counterthrusts. 
  It is typical that offensive forms of operations can be used 
in the course of a mobile defense in order to activate it; 
especially those such as landing airborne assault forces and 
assault teams in the enemy rear; sending out enveloping and 
raiding detachments; and conducting counterattacks and 
counterthrusts. Bold, daring raids through enemy rear areas made 
by air assault detachments are especially effective. Their 
surprise raids on columns; command and control facilities; 
weapons; air defense, EW and reconnaissance assets; and rear and 
other installations are capable of spreading disorganization in 
enemy actions and in the command and control of his troops and 
weapons, and substantially hampering maneuver capability. 
  With respect to counterattacks, there are many features in 
their conduct in a mobile defense. In contrast to a position 
defense, in a mobile defense they usually are delivered more 
often, but with small forces and briefly, and their success is 
not exploited. The main goal of counterattacks is to support the 
disengagement of defending subunits. Delivering a surprise 
attack on the enemy considerably contributes to this. 
  It is not difficult to notice that the basis of all tactics 
examined which are employed in a modern defense is a broad 
maneuver of fire, personnel and equipment. It is important that 
it be swift and preemptive in nature. An attacking enemy's 
efforts will be successfully nullified only when he is late in 
deploying, in delivering a fire strike, in executing regroupings 
and in building up efforts. 
<H3>  3. Principle of Decisiveness and Aggressiveness in Offensive 
Battle and the Meeting Engagement </H3>
  Decisiveness and aggressiveness reflect the main qualitative 
feature of the offensive. As the history of warfare shows, 
however, with each new stage in development of means of warfare 
it becomes more and more difficult for the attacking side to 
achieve superiority over the defense, whose stability and 
aggressiveness increase simultaneously with the growth in 
penetrating power of attacking troops. 
  Fig. 7 schematically shows certain ways and methods of 
realizing requirements of the principle of decisiveness and 
aggressiveness in offensive battle and the meeting engagement. 
The paramount task which arises for troops in offensive battle 
and the meeting engagement is to seize and hold the initiative 
of operations. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-003LC-44A>             Fig. 7. Methods of realizing the principle of </FIG>



  The attacking side has an important advantage in this 
respect. It is capable of choosing the time, place and methods 
of delivering attacks at its discretion. This creates 
preconditions for dictating one's will on the enemy. But the 
first-strike advantage usually is not retained for long. It can 
be lost if the attacker displays indecisiveness and sluggishness 
in actions, which enables the defender to recover from the 
attack and organize a stubborn resistance. 
  Combat experience shows that even the "argument of force," 
i.e., the superiority in personnel and equipment established on 
the main axis, may not play its role in such a situation. Here 
is an example. In the Volkhov operation in the summer of 1943 a 
superiority over the enemy was achieved in the breakthrough 
sector of 12th Guards Rifle Division as follows: 1:3.5 in 
battalions, 1:5 in guns and 1:3 in tanks. But this did not 
ensure success. During the assault, division units succeeded in 
taking only two enemy trenches, after which their advance was 
halted. 
  This happened because sluggishness was shown in taking 
advantage of the results of fire, much time was lost negotiating 
engineer obstacles ahead of the FEBA, and the infantry assault 
was listless. Taking advantage of this, the enemy managed to 
restore the disrupted fire plan and soon also undertake a 
counterattack. 
  The commander of 69th Army's 312th Rifle Division acted 
differently in the Vistula-Oder operation in January 1945. 
Despite the fact that superiority over the enemy in the division 
zone of advance was minimal (1:2.5 in infantry, 1:2.3 in tanks 
and 1:2.4 in artillery), success of the units' operations was 
significant. On the very first day the division advanced 12 km. 
This was achieved because the division commander acted boldly 
and decisively. He succeeded in ensuring covertness in preparing 
the offensive, carefully organizing for battle, and mobilizing 
the personnel to display high aggressiveness in combat. 
  Here is how the commander taught inexperienced soldiers to 
act during the assault. He said: "The important thing is to rise 
up for the assault promptly. . . . Remember: The enemy has not 
yet collected himself in the first minute after artillery 
preparation; in the second minute the enemy feels himself to see 
whether or not he is whole; in the third minute he searches for 
weapons and fires. We are 300-400 m from the enemy. A fighting 
man walks 120 paces and runs 250 paces per minute. That means in 
the first two minutes you will be hitting an enemy who has not 
come to his senses. But if you delay just for a minute or a 
half-minute, the enemy will greet you with fire."[.sup]46[/] 
  At the present time, in contrast to the past, conditions are 
being created for increasing the decisiveness of an assault. In 
the past war it was executed in dismounted formation and its 
rate was low, in the best case 800-1,000 m/hr, and the depth of 
a penetration assault was 2-3 km. Based on exercise experience, 
now in an assault in IFV's (APC's) without the personnel 
dismounting the rate of forward movement in penetrating a 
deliberate defense is 3-4 km/hr and the average daily rate is 
20-25 km. 
  Decisiveness of operations in the offensive and in a meeting 
engagement largely depends on how rapidly troops succeed in 
creating fire superiority over the enemy. This task is 
extraordinarily complex. A modern defense possesses high 
firepower. Its saturation with various weapons has increased by 
2-4 times compared with World War II. Their mobility and 
firepower increased sharply and the maximum range of weapons 
rose by 3-5 times (Table 2). They are capable of exerting 
pressure on an attacking grouping to its full depth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  For example, here is how the depth of weapon effect is 
distributed in the U.S. Army defense in accordance with the 
"air-land operation" concept. A zone of fire of from 1 to 30-40 
km is assigned for artillery, including MLRS, from 10-15 to 
60-70 km for tactical missile systems, from 50-70 to 400-1,000 
km for operational missile systems, up to 300-400 km for J-SAK 
reconnaissance-strike complexes, 300-500 km or more for tactical 
aviation and up to 20-70 km for combat helicopters. 
  The ratio of offensive and defensive weapons now is such 
that 
it permits drawing the conclusion that their opposition will 
take on an especially intensive character. The "fire tenacity" 
of the defense has increased many times and now it is not enough 
to disorganize the artillery-mortar fire plan in order for an 
attacker to be able to dictate his will on the enemy; this 
requires deep engagement of targets, above all precision weapon 
systems--reconnaissance-strike and reconnaissance-fire 
complexes, nuclear attack weapons, combat helicopters, EW 
assets, as well as remote minelaying equipment. 
  We will note that the striving to increase the depth of 
effect on the enemy also was clearly displayed in Soviet troop 
operations in the Great Patriotic War. While the defense was 
suppressed to a depth of 2.5-3 km by massed artillery fire in 
offensive operations of 1941-1942 and to a depth of 3-4 km in 
operations of 1943, during 1944-1945 the depth of simultaneous 
suppression of the enemy defense increased to 6-8 km and in the 
concluding operations it often reached 15 km or 
more.[.sup]48[/] 
  Under present conditions deep fire engagement should take in 
enemy weapons situated both in the tactical as well as 
operational zone of his defense. This is determined by the fact 
that the bulk of enemy weapons are situated at a considerable 
depth from the troops' line of contact. Thus, the experience of 
NATO Allied Forces exercises held in the 1980's showed that 
field artillery firing positions in the defense of formations 
are assigned at a distance of 3-5 km, firing positions of 
artillery employing Copperhead and SADARM guided projectiles 
8-10 km, and MLRS 10-25 km from the FEBA; helicopters with 
jammers operate from zones 10-15 km from the line of contact; 
control centers for J-SAK reconnaissance-strike complexes are 
situated at a distance of 30-50 km, facilities of the TACELIS 
and REMBASS reconnaissance systems at a distance of 30-160 km, 
and loiter zones of aircraft of the PLSS, AWACS and Nimrod 
systems at a distance of 30-160 km from the FEBA.[.sup]49[/] 
  The depth of fire engagement in the offensive increases 
accordingly. American specialists assert that the depth of the 
zone of simultaneous combat effect by organic and attached 
weapons should be 15 km for brigade, 70 km for division, 150 km 
for army corps and 300-500 km or more for army 
group.[.sup]50[/] Within limits of these zones the priority 
in fire engagement is given to continuous fire effect on nuclear 
attack weapons, precision weapon systems, facilities for command 
and control of troops and weapons, and targets of the enemy 
first and second echelons, which creates a precondition for 
disorganizing his fire plan. 
  Decisiveness in the struggle to win fire superiority over 
the 
enemy is manifested in preempting him in delivering deep fire 
strikes. There now are capabilities for this. Integration of 
weapons, reconnaissance equipment and command and control 
equipment in an automated system permits fire damage of the 
enemy in real or near-real time. Thus, adoption of the TACFIRE 
field artillery automated control system in U.S. Army formations 
enabled reducing fire planning time in the division from 2 hours 
to 2 minutes, and fire preparation time in the artillery 
battalion from 30 minutes to 1-2 minutes.[.sup]51[/] 
  J-SAK and PLSS reconnaissance-strike complexes possess even 
greater speed. In a matter of seconds they can detect enemy 
targets, identify them by type, issue a target designation on 
them to appropriate weapons and deliver precise, powerful fire 
strikes against the detected targets, including small moving 
ones. Pave Tiger drones also are used in an automatic mode. They 
perform an automatic search, detection, identification and 
precise destruction of air defense system radars and aircraft 
guidance radars from alert duty zones. 
  In order to achieve decisiveness and high rates in 
conducting 
an attack, it is necessary to achieve a high degree of fire 
damage of various targets in the defense. The Great Patriotic 
War experience showed that in a breakthrough it was necessary to 
destroy as a minimum up to 25 percent and suppress around 30 
percent of various targets situated in the first and second 
positions of the enemy's main defensive zone. That degree of 
fire damage now is no longer enough. 
  Such targets as means of nuclear attack, precision weapon 
systems, and facilities for command and control of troops and 
weapons must be damaged with a degree of up to 100 percent, and 
the other targets with no less a degree than 70-75 percent; 
otherwise the defender may disrupt the attack. 
  A question arises on how to attain such a high degree of 
fire 
damage if the attacker's capabilities for creating high 
artillery densities in a penetration are very limited. The only 
way to increase effectiveness of fire damage of the enemy is to 
achieve the delivery of precise, aimed strikes against targets 
and exclude the "area" suppression method. This will enable a 
significant reduction in numbers of artillery, missile 
launchers, aircraft and helicopters as well as the amount of 
ammunition used for this purpose. 
  Performance of this mission is facilitated by the fact that 
weapon accuracy now has increased sharply. For example, range 
tests showed that employment of Copperhead and SADARM precision 
artillery projectiles permits reducing ammunition expenditure by 
10-15 times. It is also the very same in aviation--use of the 
LAD guided air-dropped clusters enables reducing the expenditure 
of aerial bombs by 4-5 times. 
  An increased power of munitions largely contributes to 
effective performance of the fire damage mission. Based on 
foreign press data, the power of fuel-air explosives used by 
armies of the anti-Iraq coalition during Operation Desert Storm 
(1991) were close to a low-yield nuclear weapon in force. This 
also helps considerably decrease artillery and air densities in 
the offensive. 
  Successfully combating enemy helicopters is a new component 
element of winning fire superiority. At the present time many 
foreign armies view combat helicopters as one of the important 
means of increasing decisiveness and aggressiveness in battle. 
In the defense they are assigned to perform a mission such as 
destroying the attacker's weapons--field artillery, army 
aviation, tanks and EW assets. 
  Combating helicopters presents no small amount of 
difficulty. 
Their operations are characterized by covertness of the target 
approach, swiftness and surprise in delivering a strike, and 
high accuracy of engaging targets at long range without having 
the platform enter the impact zone of air defense weapons. Based 
on the experience of local wars and exercises, helicopters have 
proven themselves to be a highly effective means of combating 
armored targets. For example, a company of helicopters with TOW 
ATGM's is capable of destroying 80-100 tanks in one sortie. 
  In NATO troop exercise strikes by mixed aircraft-helicopter 
elements (ground attack aircraft and strike and reconnaissance 
helicopters) are widely practiced for direct air support of 
combined arms formations. In Operation Desert Storm methods of 
operations were employed, such as successive delivery of strikes 
against tanks and air defense weapons with a lengthy effect on 
the enemy and simultaneous strikes by helicopters, artillery and 
aircraft against one or more targets. 
  Combat practice and exercise experience attest to the fact 
that high helicopter mobility permits combined arms commanders 
to decisively mass fire at the necessary moment against the most 
important targets and transfer it from one axis to another in 
the shortest time periods in order to win and hold fire 
superiority. Concentrated strikes by helicopters usually are 
delivered at the most important moments of battle: Repulse of an 
assault by major tank forces, commitment of a second echelon, 
assault crossing of water obstacles. 
  All this indicates that without successfully combating enemy 
helicopters it is impossible to achieve high decisiveness and 
aggressiveness in offensive battle and the meeting engagement. 
The antihelicopter warfare system is laid down in planning the 
battle and in organizing interworking and comprehensive support. 
Measures taken for this purpose include prompt detection of 
helicopters and warning subunits of the possibility of their 
delivering strikes. The most likely strike delivery lines are 
determined in order to combat enemy helicopters, and necessary 
weapons are assigned for destroying helicopters in concentration 
areas, assembly areas and at tactical positions. Small arms 
fire, particularly antiaircraft machineguns of tank subunits 
when helicopters are in their zone of effective fire, is of no 
small importance in combating helicopters. 
  Skillful choice of effective methods of defeating the enemy 
plays a special role in realizing the principle of decisiveness 
and aggressiveness in the offensive and in the meeting 
engagement. The attacker's attempt to paralyze the defender's 
actions by delivering strikes against him from different 
directions--front, flanks and rear--was observed long ago. Such 
a method enables dissipating enemy forces and creating 
conditions for breaking up his grouping and defeating it in 
detail. But with formation of a continuous static front, such 
conditions in the two world wars were presented to troops 
primarily in a meeting engagement or in the dynamics of combat 
operations, when the attacker employed maneuver and took 
advantage of gaps which had formed and of exposed flanks in the 
enemy combat alignment. 
  In breaking through an enemy defense prepared in advance and 
well fortified in the engineer sense, the attacker was forced to 
methodically "gnaw through" it, gradually grinding down his 
personnel and equipment. Under such conditions mobile operations 
were extremely limited. Still, as the troops' attack potential 
built up, the attacker tried to increase the aggressiveness of 
operations by delivering frontal attacks against the enemy 
across a broad front on a number of axes. But at that time this 
was the prerogative only of the operational echelon. 
  Now the situation has changed. Combined arms formations have 
the capability of employing very decisive methods of defeating 
the enemy, such as delivering splitting attacks from the front 
by forces of tank and motorized rifle units on one or two axes 
in combination with a simultaneous landing of airborne assault 
forces in the enemy rear, and also with swift penetrations by 
mobile units and subunits--forward, enveloping and raiding 
detachments--into the depth of the defense. This permits 
paralyzing the defender's operations, constraining the maneuver 
of his reserves and creating preconditions for their swift 
defeat in detail. 
  In a meeting engagement, when the enemy has exposed flanks, 
a 
combination ground-air strike can be delivered both from the 
front as well as from the flanks. As shown by exercise 
experience, a special effect is produced by a two-sided deep 
envelopment of the enemy with a move into his deep rear in 
combination with operations by a tactical airborne assault force. 
  Speaking of realizing the principle of decisiveness in the 
offensive, one cannot fail to take into account those 
difficulties which arise in this connection, especially in 
overcoming a stable antitank defense. Already in World War II 
the antitank defense was the "backbone" of the entire defense 
system. It was established to the full tactical and operational 
depth. The density of antitank weapons on the most important 
axes reached 20-30 or more. Under present conditions the 
importance of an antitank defense has grown even more and, what 
is especially important, the majority of antitank weapons are 
armored and self-propelled. The number of such targets in 
formations of foreign armies is constantly increasing (Table 3).

  As is apparent from the table's data, while the number of 
armored antitank weapons in the U.S. mechanized division was 415 
in 1985, their number became 834 in the division of the modern 
organization. This led to a significant increase in density of 
these weapons in defense. Thus, based on experience of NATO 
Allied Forces exercises conducted in the 1980's, the average 
density of antitank weapons on the most important axes in the 
defense was 70-90 per kilometer of frontage. This is 2-3 times 
higher than in World War II. 
  But it is not only a matter of an increased number of 
antitank weapons in combined arms formations; it is also a 
matter of their qualitative upgrading. In the late 1950's a new, 
very effective antitank weapon--antitank guided missiles 
possessing a high probability of hitting a tank and high 
reliability of killing it--appeared and became widespread. The 
experience of local wars showed that ATGM's had taken a leading 
place among other antitank weapons. Thus, while in World War II 
troops suffered the main tank losses from the fire of antitank 
tube artillery, in the Arab-Israeli War (1973) these losses, 
distinguished by a previously unknown scale, were distributed as 
follows: More than half from ATGM's, up to 22 percent from tank 
fire, and around 28 percent from strikes by aircraft and other 
weapons.[.sup]53[/] 
  Now many armies have three generations of guided missiles in 
the inventory. While the accuracy of first-generation ATGM's was 
0.5-0.6, that of subsequent generations was 0.8-0.9. At the 
present time, engaging armored targets by direct laying is based 
on the principle of "find-fire-kill." It is typical that ATGM's 
are set up not only on mobile ground platforms, but also 
airborne platforms. As a result, very effective missile systems 
have been created on combat helicopters and IFV's, which 
increased the defense's antitank stability even more. But the 
arsenal of antitank defense weapons is not exhausted by this. In 
addition to ATGM's, tanks and antitank artillery, an important 
role in engaging armored targets is played by 
reconnaissance-strike and reconnaissance-fire complexes, 
robotized antitank missile systems, drones, fuel-air explosives, 
remote minelaying equipment and so on. 
  In connection with the sharp increase in antitank stability 
of the modern defense, its decisive surmounting demands a search 
for new, more effective methods. All personnel and equipment 
which the attacker has are used for this. Inasmuch as the 
majority of antitank weapons have armor protection, as already 
noted, destroying them requires delivering accurate, aimed 
strikes essentially against each armored target. 
Reconnaissance-strike and reconnaissance-fire complexes capable 
of quickly detecting targets and delivering a strike against 
them in a matter of seconds play an important role in 
accomplishing this mission. 
  New weapons are being developed and existing ones upgraded 
to 
increase the effectiveness of air strikes against armored 
targets. Cluster munitions filled with submunitions having 
individual systems for homing on targets are considered the most 
promising. Thus, the Skeet submunition, equipped with a thermal 
homing system, is intended for hitting an armored target in the 
most vulnerable spot (the roof). An important feature of the 
submunitions is their capability to turn into antitank mines 
when they fall to the ground. Air-to-ground guided missiles, 
free-flight rockets, aerial bombs, and pod dispensers which can 
be suspended from all types of attack aircraft are filled with 
such submunitions. 
  According to foreign press reports, in Operation Desert 
Storm 
U.S. aircraft employed such methods of delivering strikes with 
aircraft precision weapons as a "pocket strike," "a toss into 
the electronic basket over the battlefield," "delayed-attack 
strike," "swarming attack," and so on. In the assessment of 
foreign military experts, use of new weapons, 
reconnaissance-strike and reconnaissance-fire complexes, and 
combat helicopters with optimum operating methods reduces the 
requisite detail of aircraft forces and other weapons assigned 
to destroy antitank weapons in the enemy defense by 20-30 times. 
  Disrupting the enemy antitank defense system requires 
suppressing (destroying) or neutralizing 70-80 percent of his 
antitank weapons back in the period of fire preparation of the 
assault. Taking into account their considerable range (5-6 km), 
it is necessary to suppress antitank weapons to the depth of two 
positions simultaneously. Results of fire strikes against 
antitank targets must be exploited without delay by attacking 
tank and motorized rifle subunits. The swifter the assault, the 
fewer losses the attacker will suffer and the faster he will 
gain an opportunity to surmount the zone of massed, continuous, 
multilayered enemy antitank fire. Tactical exercise experience 
shows that with an increase in the pace of the attack by 1.5 
times, attacking subunits' losses from enemy fire dropped by 2-3 
times.[.sup]54[/] 
  The principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness is linked 
inseparably with attaining continuity of development of the 
offensive battle and meeting engagement and high rates of 
pursuit of the enemy; with nonstop assault crossing of water 
obstacles; and with the troops' ability to fight with maximum 
exertion of forces at any time of day or year, in any weather, 
and quickly surmount the obstacles and natural barriers they 
encounter. Zhukov noted that "swiftness is the principal means 
for fastest defeat of the enemy. It is necessary to act so 
swiftly that the enemy is late here, there and everywhere. It is 
necessary to learn this and to bring up our troops on it. Our 
technical outfitting permits us to execute the boldest and 
swiftest attacks."[.sup]55[/] 
  A characteristic feature of modern offensive battle is that 
it usually takes in the entire tactical depth of the enemy 
defense simultaneously. Under such conditions subunits must be 
able to conduct deep battle in his rear, acting for a lengthy 
time in isolation from the main body; make daring deep and close 
envelopments and surprise raids on staffs and weapon firing 
(launch) positions; intercept his lines of communication; and 
fight forward-moving reserves and airmobile subunits. It is 
important not to displace enemy groupings from one position to 
another, but to split them, surround them and destroy them in 
detail. 
  Commanders and staffs at all levels must unremittingly "keep 
their hands on the pulse of events" by displaying high mobility 
and promptly build up efforts on those axes where success has 
appeared. It is important not to give the enemy an opportunity 
to restore a disrupted fire and obstacle plan or to execute a 
planned regrouping of personnel and equipment laterally and out 
of the depth. The initiative of actions and command and control 
should be held firmly by commanders in any situation. 
  During the Great Patriotic War the Soviet command attached 
special importance to aggressive troop operations in the course 
of exploiting a breakthrough and in the pursuit. One directive 
of a tank army commander instructed: "Successful mission 
performance depends above all on swiftness, boldness and 
decisiveness of your actions. . . . Do not be afraid to break 
away from the infantry, swiftly move forward, boldly destroy 
individual enemy centers, and spread panic among his 
troops."[.sup]56[/] 
  But during the war our commanders did not always make 
skilled 
use of the principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness in their 
actions. In the book "V nachale voyny" [At the Beginning of the 
War] A. I. Yeremenko describes the following episode. In August 
1941 a serious situation took shape for Soviet troops in the 
vicinity of Bryansk. Having seized Unecha Station, the Germans 
cut 13th Army maneuver routes and created a threat of its 
encirclement. To disrupt the fascists' plans and restore the 
lost position, the Bryansk Front command sent the 55th Cavalry 
Division into the enemy rear. It successfully penetrated into 
the depth of the fascist German troop disposition. Division 
reconnaissance determined the Germans' total unconcern: Their 
columns were moving forward near our units often without 
security. But the division command lost valuable time and took 
no actions, awaiting instructions of the senior commander. 
Having spent around a week in all in the enemy rear, the 
division returned without having performed the assigned mission, 
although it had all opportunities for this -- it was well manned 
and armed.[.sup]57[/] 
  Commitment of second echelons of units and formations was 
the 
principal means of exploiting success in the past war. Already 
in the battle for the first position of the enemy defense it was 
necessary to put to use not only second echelons of regiments, 
but also often of divisions. The breakthrough of the main 
defense zone usually was accomplished with great difficulties. 
In many operations it was necessary to commit mobile groups of 
armies or even of fronts to complete its breakthrough. This 
reduced rates of development of the operation. 
  Now flexible massing of fire on a decisive axis is the 
principal condition for a successful buildup of combat efforts. 
Surprise fire strikes can disrupt the enemy's attempts to 
organize the closing of breaches which have formed or carry out 
a planned withdrawal of his troops to prepared lines and the 
maneuver of reserves. The western press notes that surprise in 
delivering a strike is the equivalent of increasing the assets 
participating in it by 2.5 times.[.sup]58[/] 
  Fire strikes, even those delivered against deep targets of 
the defense, must be exploited by the troops without delay. An 
important role here belongs to tactical airborne assault forces 
and to forward, enveloping and raiding detachments. The Great 
Patriotic War experience showed that bold raids through enemy 
rears even by small subunits are capable of significantly 
facilitating successful execution of a combat mission by a unit 
or formation. For example, success of the 1st and 2nd guards 
tank corps in the East Prussian operation in 1945 to defeat the 
German Insterburg-Gumbinnen grouping was ensured by decisive 
operations of tank platoons commanded by Senior Lieutenant I. P. 
Kondrashin and Junior Lieutenant I. S. Malov. In fierce fighting 
they captured bridges across the Pregel River, which was 
difficult to cross.[.sup]59[/] Conferral of the Hero of the 
Soviet Union title was a worthy reward for the daredevils. 
  Airborne assault forces are of special importance in swift 
realization of fire strikes against deep enemy targets and in 
creating a constantly operating active front in his rear. In the 
course of the offensive's development they perform missions of 
seizing road junctions, crossings, passes and other important 
objectives in the enemy rear, delay the forward movement of his 
reserves, disrupt their maneuver, assist attacking troops in 
swiftly surmounting enemy defensive lines and natural obstacles, 
and create conditions for defeating his groupings in detail. 
  Skilled advantage taken of night conditions largely 
contributes to attaining high decisiveness and continuity of 
development of the offensive. Aggressive, large-scale night 
actions give troops a number of tactical advantages. Under cover 
of the darkness of night they can deliver surprise attacks 
against the enemy, execute a concealed maneuver and carry out 
feints. 
  But night hampers the operations of advancing units and 
subunits to no small extent. Even with wide use of technical 
support equipment their maneuver capabilities are reduced by 
30-40 percent in the darkness, ammunition expenditure and time 
for damaging targets increases by 1.5-2 times, and the 
negotiation of engineer obstacles and natural barriers is 
substantially hampered. Personnel fatigue increases during 
operations in the darkness. Therefore a night offensive must be 
carefully prepared and supported. Only on this condition is it 
possible to count on its high effectiveness. 
  It is said correctly that night is the ally of the bold and 
brave. Taking advantage of nighttime in the past war, Soviet 
commanders widely employed varied procedures of stratagem. We 
will cite an example. In August 1943 Captain Ye. V. Shkudralov, 
commander of a tank battalion of the 181st Tank Brigade, 18th 
Tank Corps, making a raid in the enemy rear to take the city of 
Zlochev, took advantage of the darkness, joined an enemy column 
unnoticed and approached the city without hindrance. At dawn the 
tankers routed the enemy column by a surprise attack and burst 
into Zlochev. High combat aggressiveness, decisiveness and 
resourcefulness ensured success. Captain Shkudralov was awarded 
the Hero of the Soviet Union title for this battle.[.sup]60[/] 
  In conclusion, we will emphasize that skillful use of the 
principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness by commanders and 
staffs is a sure way to achieve success with fewer costs and 
losses. To confirm this conclusion we refer to experience of 
39th Army. In 1944 it conducted two offensive operations. In 
one, conducted in February, the army advanced at a rate of 0.5 
km per day and in the other operation (Vitebsk) at a rate of 9 
km per day. With higher rates of advance in the Vitebsk 
operation, personnel losses were six times fewer and tank losses 
20 times fewer than in the February operation.[.sup]61[/] 
<H5>  Conclusions and Recommendations </H5>
  1. Demands of the principle of decisiveness and 
aggressiveness can be traced through all Soviet Armed Forces 
field manuals. They emphasize that under all situations 
commanders, staffs and all personnel must act daringly, boldly, 
and vigorously; seize and hold the initiative; strive to impose 
their will on the enemy, disrupt his plans, place him in 
unfavorable conditions; skillfully use the enemy's weak spots 
and the advantages of friendly troops; boldly concentrate main 
efforts on the most important axis and persistently strive to 
execute assigned combat missions; and carry on an aggressive 
struggle to hold fire superiority and air supremacy. 
  2. This principle finds concrete reflection in the 
determination of decisive goals of battle and effective methods 
of achieving them which would allow taking full advantage of 
favorable situation conditions and combat capabilities of units 
and subunits--their striking power, firepower, mobility, and the 
personnel's morale and fighting qualities--in order to strive 
for delivery of a preemptive strike against the enemy and for 
his fastest defeat, and to deprive him of the opportunity to 
choose the methods, direction, character, time and place of 
actions favorable for him. 
  3. To fully realize demands of the principle of decisiveness 
and aggressiveness in the defense it is necessary to constantly 
upgrade methods of preparing and conducting the defense, taking 
advantage of the strong aspects both of the position form as 
well as mobile form of the defense; and to strive for deep fire 
damage of the enemy in the course of his concentration, forward 
movement and deployment. It is important to establish defensive 
fire barriers on distant and close approaches to the defense to 
isolate the battlefield, cut off enemy reserves, disrupt his 
maneuver and block lines of communication. To disrupt the enemy 
offensive and exploit results of fire counterpreparation 
conducted under the senior commander's plan, it is necessary to 
enliven the actions of defending troops in every way, land 
airborne assault forces and raiding and reconnaissance parties 
in his rear under favorable conditions in organizing daring 
raids against his rear areas, and deliver surprise strikes by a 
portion of the forces with a move beyond the FEBA. 
  Combat aggressiveness of defending troops must reach the 
culmination in the fight to hold the FEBA, since stability of 
the defense depends on this to a decisive extent. All defenders' 
short and long range forces and assets and all procedures of 
stratagem and for deceiving the attacker are committed to repel 
the enemy assault; a fixed and creeping artillery barrage ahead 
of the FEBA and on the flanks is established in combination with 
remote mining of the terrain; the enemy is drawn into fire 
pockets; and strikes are delivered against him from ambushes. 
The actions of roving tanks, IFV's, guns and self-propelled 
antiaircraft guns are used widely to mislead the enemy. 
  In case the enemy wedges into the defense, air-fire and 
ground screens are created on his forward movement routes and 
directions of overflight of airmobile detachments; decisive 
measures are taken to combat airborne assault forces and raiding 
and reconnaissance units which have been landed; attacking tanks 
and motorized infantry are destroyed by fire from in place; and 
under favorable conditions counterattacks are carried out to 
rout a wedged-in enemy grouping and restore a lost position. 
  4. Skillfully realizing demands of the principle of 
decisiveness and aggressiveness in an offensive battle and the 
meeting engagement means: 

  -  upgrading forms and methods of seizing and holding the 
initiative of operations; finding new ways to take advantage of 
the factor of time and surprise and of tactics unexpected by the 
enemy in methods of preparing and launching an offensive and in 
increasing the decisiveness of an "armored" attack; 
  -  ensuring 
that fire superiority is won over the enemy in the first minutes 
and firmly held in the course of battle, which requires the 
following: Striving to preempt him in delivering fire strikes; 
increasing the depth of fire effect on the enemy by 3-7 times 
compared with the past; increasing the degree of fire damage of 
primary targets in the defense by 1.5-2 times; achieving top 
priority destruction of enemy precision weapon systems and means 
of nuclear attack and swift disorganization of his systems for 
command and control of troops and weapons; and waging an 
effective fight against enemy combat helicopters; 
  -  comprehensively upgrading methods of defeating the enemy by 
attempting to deliver combination air-ground strikes against him 
from the front, flanks and rear in order to paralyze the actions 
of all elements of the defense to its full depth in short time 
periods; and striving for success in an early stage and swiftly 
exploiting it subsequently; 
  -  striving for continuity of the 
offensive's development at a high pace and to a great depth, and 
conducting it day and night in any weather; executing a decisive 
pursuit of the retreating enemy; making nonstop assault 
crossings of water obstacles; swiftly negotiating obstacles and 
natural barriers; promptly restoring combat effectiveness of 
troops subjected to nuclear and fire strikes; and keeping up the 
troops' high morale and fighting spirit. 

    5. The principle of decisiveness and aggressiveness places 
demands on combat employment of combat arms and air arms; it 
dictates the need to have them ensure continuity of fire support 
of troops in the course of battle, high stability of the 
defense, and attainment of swiftness and high rates of troop 
advance in the offensive. 
  6. Like other principles of battle, the principle of 
decisiveness and aggressiveness demands that commanders display 
creativeness and innovation, make uncommon decisions, and choose 
nonstandard ways of concentrating main efforts, achieving 
surprise, executing flexible, bold maneuver and maintaining 
precise interworking, flexible, firm command and control, and 
comprehensive support to battle. 
  It is important to remember that the enemy also will strive 
for decisive, aggressive actions in all kinds of battle. 
Consequently, it is necessary to constantly maintain the troops' 
high combat readiness, promptly take steps to prevent his 
surprise attack, conduct reconnaissance, and anticipate the 
development of combat events.

<H3>  CHAPTER FOUR - COORDINATED EMPLOYMENT OF SUBUNITS OF COMBAT 
ARMS AND SPECIAL TROOPS AND MAINTENANCE OF CONTINUOUS 
INTERWORKING AMONG THEM </H3>
[.sup]1[/] 
  Interworking consists of operations by troops 
(forces) coordinated by objective, missions, place, time and 
methods of mission accomplishment for achieving the objective of 
the battle or operation; one of the principles of military 
art.

  Interworking and mutual help are the best 
tactics.

operations.

by superiors in the war of 1904-1905. 
  There can be no victory in modern battle without 
precise, continuous interworking. 
  R. Ya. Malinovskiy 
<H3>  1. From the History of the Origin and Development of the 
Principle of Interworking </H3>
  The principle of interworking is considered one of the most 
important in all world armies. Many works have been written 
about its importance and essence, and there probably are no 
generalizing directive instructions on troop combat training 
which would not mention interworking in one form or another. 
This also was discussed thoroughly in prewar Red Army Field 
Service Regulations. But when the Great Patriotic War broke out 
it was learned that our commanders and staffs proved to be 
especially poorly trained, specifically in questions of 
coordinating troop combat efforts. They made many 
miscalculations in this matter. 
  A striking gap occurred between word and action, between 
theory and practice. Here is what 22nd Army Commander Lieutenant 
General G. P. Korotkov, who went through the entire war from the 
first to the last shot, said on this score at a 1945 Army 
Military-Science Conference devoted to an analysis of experience 
of combat operations: "There was no regular commander before the 
war who would not have learned the popular aphorism: Without 
interworking there is no victory. But the war began and the 
first and biggest flaws' at all our command echelons showed up 
in coordination of mutual operations of infantry with artillery 
and combat engineers, and of infantrymen with tankers. . . . It 
took almost one and one-half years of stubborn battles for us 
finally to learn to interwork genuinely and aggressively in the 
offensive and the defense." 
  War experience showed that nowhere is the commander's 
tactical competence manifested so clearly and with such 
completeness as in organizing and accomplishing interworking in 
battle. Reflected here as in a mirror are his combat 
proficiency, knowledge of combat capabilities of combat arms, 
ability to use them sensibly in accomplishing combat missions 
and make up for weak aspects of one kind of weapon or combat 
equipment with strong aspects of other kinds, and ability to 
anticipate the development of events and not allow all possible 
chance happenings to perniciously affect the troops. 
Interworking tolerates no amateurishness. Only a comprehensively 
trained, erudite officer is capable of successfully coping with 
this difficult task in a combat situation. 
  The objective of the chapter is to help the officer master 
the art of leading troops; to show in examples how the principle 
of interworking originated and developed since ancient times and 
how and under the influence of what factors its content was 
renewed; and on this basis to develop certain practical 
recommendations and certain advice as to how to implement the 
demands of this principle most expediently in different kinds of 
modern battle. 
  We will note that like other principles of battle, the 
principle of interworking went through two stages in its 
evolution--the stage of the empirical experiment by the 
trial-and-error method and [the stage of] theoretical 
generalizations and development of scientifically substantiated 
provisions on this question. The "Voyennaya entsiklopediya" 
[Military Encyclopedia] aptly put it: "Every area of human 
creativeness (also including military affairs) goes through a 
phase of unconscious art and in the end arrives at a rational 
art having a rather substantiated science (principles, rules, 
forms, norms and so on)."[.sup]2[/] 
  The first step in amassing experience in organizing 
interworking in battle was made in ancient Egypt, Assyria, 
Babylon, China and India. Already during the slaveholding 
formation military historians and thinkers were attempting to 
find recipes for victory, among which, as Euripides noted, was 
the striving to learn to achieve a common goal in different ways. 
  One of the most ancient sources setting forth precepts on 
how 
to prepare and fight a battle and achieve coordination of 
operations is the Chinese "Seven Books," particularly the 
treatise "On the Art of Warfare" by Wu Zi, military theorist and 
field general of ancient China (5th-4th centuries B.C.). It 
notes that one must win in war by the best organization and 
cohesiveness of operations. "If an army obeys a single 
authority," wrote Wu Zi, "and acts in a coordinated way, then 
commanders and soldiers execute orders in battle, there is no 
enemy who could resist, there is no combat formation which could 
stand fast."[.sup]3[/] 
  Coordinated use of four-wheeled war chariots in battle 
together with infantry and cavalry is of interest in combat 
operations by armies of the first states of the Ancient East. 
The chariots were used for operations on an axis where success 
had appeared. By using this mobile means of attack, an army 
could pursue the enemy. It is typical that a missile-throwing 
weapon, the arbalest, appeared for the first time in the ancient 
Chinese army, which enabled engaging the enemy from a distance. 
  Interworking saw substantial development in wars of Ancient 
Greece, Macedonia, Rome and Carthage. It was then that the need 
arose for operations of ground forces to be mutually tied in 
with warships and transport vessels. The presence in the 
inventory of the Greek and Roman armies of rams and siege 
equipment in the form of mobile antifortress towers in 
combination with missile-throwing weapons--catapults and 
ballistas--complicated the nature of battle and permitted 
shifting from a lengthy siege to an assault of fortified 
city-fortresses. As a result of evolution, the battle was 
divided as it were into two stages--preparation of battle and 
its conduct (hand-to-hand fighting). The military leader was 
required to coordinate combat efforts of mixed forces: Infantry, 
cavalry, war chariots, detachments of sappers who performed 
military engineer work, and also the rear service (Fig. 8). 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-003LC-54A>             Fig. 8. Battle of Gaugamela </FIG>



  Initial experience in matters of coordinating troop efforts 
found a certain reflection in the following works by ancient 
writers: "Advice for Cavalry Commanders," "Advice for 
Cavalrymen" and "Cyropaedia" by Xenophon; "Tactics" by Aeneas; 
"Tactics" by Asclepiodotus; "Theory of Tactics" by Aelian; "The 
Jugurthine War" by Sallustius Crispus; "Civil War" by Julius 
Caesar; "The Annals" by Cornelius Tacitus; "Stratagems" by 
Julius Frontinus; "Manual for Military Leaders" by Onasander; "A 
Brief Exposition of Principles of Military Affairs" by Vegetius; 
and "Strategikon" by False-Mauricius. 
  An improvement in interworking occurred slowly in the period 
of the Middle Ages. The period of formation of feudal 
relationships in military affairs initially was characterized by 
an absence of precise tactical forms. Outfitted with primitive 
weapons for hand-to-hand combat, an army fought in dense crowds. 
Organizationally it was not broken into subunits. As metal 
weapons and protective gear improved and their numbers 
increased, combat formations of infantry as the main combat arm 
of that time evolved from deep column-like and wedge-like 
formations to formations of the phalanx type that were extended 
laterally and were shallower but were dense and more organized. 
  Eastern Slavs called such a formation a "wall." Lightly 
armed 
infantry (bowmen) and cavalry were intended for conducting 
reconnaissance, engaging, and covering flanks of the "wall." The 
latter decided the outcome of battle by its attack. Subsequent 
development of tactics required breaking up the "wall" both 
laterally as well as in depth. Initially the division of a 
combat formation into three parts (a "shelf row"), and then into 
a larger number of parts appeared in Rus (Fig. 9). In conducting 
battle the regiments--right-hand regiment, left-hand regiment, 
"forehead" (center) regiment, ambuscade force--began to use a 
varying alignment, as a result of which the depth of the 
battlefield increased and maneuver and countermaneuver by 
regiments began to be accomplished more widely. This complicated 
coordination of troop combat efforts. Often it would happen as 
follows: The center regiment, the "forehead," would repel an 
enemy attack from the front and the right-hand and left-hand 
regiments would envelop him from the flanks, as occurred, for 
example, in the Battle on Lake Peipus in 1242. The military 
leader was required to correctly distribute forces to the 
regiments, assign missions for all parts of the combat 
formation, tie their actions together, promptly commit the 
reserve, organize the pursuit and so on. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-003LC-55A>             Fig. 9. Troop combat formations of Kievan Rus: </FIG>



  The appearance of firearms in the period of the late Middle 
Ages had a great influence on development of interworking. This 
was manifested in Rus in the fact that a standing army armed 
with firearms was formed already in the middle of the 16th 
century. The "Nakaz ugorskim voyevodam" [Instructions to Ugorsk 
Voevodes] prescribed rehearsing the following tactics of 
fighting the forays by steppe inhabitants: "Divide the 
harquebusiers and pososhnyye by regiments, as many as there must 
be ashore, and the voevodes and their people are to be at the 
ready." It was envisaged that pososhnyye (auxiliary infantry) 
should immobilize the enemy, harquebusiers armed with handheld 
firearms should engage him by fire and in hand-to-hand combat, 
and the noble landed cavalry (boyar children) should exploit 
success. Later the artillery joined these combat arms. Small 
cannons (the "small detail") would cover the actions of 
pososhnyye and harquebusiers and the great cannons (the "large 
detail") would enter battle at a decisive moment. 
  Simultaneously with this, in the 15th-17th centuries 
detachments of craftsmen specialists appeared in the Russian 
Army: "wall builders," who engaged in building fortifications; 
"bridge builders," who built bridges and crossings; and 
"ballista experts," who built siege machines 
(poroks). These were the first predecessors of 
Russian military engineers, sappers and pontonmen. The 
development of artillery lent great impetus to creating special 
engineer subunits inasmuch as, on the one hand, a need appeared 
to accomplish engineer measures to support artillery combat 
operations and, on the other hand, it was necessary to build 
engineer structures for protection against enemy artillery fire 
and other weapons. 
  The role of interworking in battle elevated especially with 
the appearance of mass armies (late 18th-early 19th centuries). 
The nature of combat operations changed and their spatial scope 
increased under the influence of more sophisticated means of 
warfare. Under those conditions the military leader was forced 
to coordinate troop efforts with their deployment across a 
rather broad front, with the use of deep combat formations and 
with fighting on rough terrain. 
  Many new tactics appeared in artillery operations in wars of 
the first half of the 19th century. Artillery was employed for 
splitting enemy combat formations. The principle of massing 
artillery fire was established as a result not only of the use 
of large batteries, but also of the battlefield maneuver of 
pieces. Missions began to be divided among separate artillery 
groups. An artillery reserve was established. Interworking with 
other combat arms acquired great importance.[.sup]4[/] 
  New features of interworking were manifested especially 
clearly in the Patriotic War of 1812, above all in the Battle of 
Borodino. The strong side of Russian troop tactics was that they 
combined the actions of infantry with artillery and cavalry in 
battle more flexibly than did the French. In repelling an 
assault of Napoleon's troops, chasseurs operating in extended 
order would cover strongpoints of artillery batteries making up 
the framework of the entire Russian defense, and line infantry 
together with cavalry would deliver an attack against the 
wedged-in enemy (figs. 10 and 11). 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-003LC-56A>             Fig. 10. Battle of Borodino [remainder of caption </FIG>






<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-003LC-57A></FIG>



                But the war also identified major shortcomings in 
interworking of infantry with artillery. The fact was that at 
that time the infantry operated primarily in battalion columns 
and it was difficult for it to combine maneuver and attack with 
artillery fire. The chasseurs and artillery used their fire to 
prepare the infantry bayonet attack, but they were incapable of 
giving it fire support during exploitation of success. As a 
result, the striking power of infantry units proved to be 
insufficiently powerful. 
  The experience of the Patriotic War of 1812 showed that 
under 
the altered conditions of battle it was necessary to give 
division and regimental commanders more freedom of actions in 
matters of command and control and coordination of troop combat 
efforts. The time had passed for commanders in chief to draw up 
detailed operation orders which specified subordinates' every 
step for the entire time of the battle. 
  The system of troop interworking in battle developed further 
under the determining influence of the appearance of rifled 
weapons, smokeless powder and high explosives and employment of 
technical communications equipment. New features of interworking 
were clearly manifested in the Franco-Prussian (1870-1871), 
Crimean (1853-1856) and Russo-Turkish (1877-1878) wars. The 
infantry acquired new combat qualities. Armed with rifled 
weapons, it began to possess greater striking power. This 
allowed it not only to strive to defeat the enemy in 
hand-to-hand combat, but also to inflict a loss on him by its 
fire even while closing with him. The increased range of fire of 
artillery and infantry weapons engendered a new, dispersed 
combat formation, the extended line of riflemen. Troops began 
deploying into combat formation at a considerable distance from 
the enemy (Fig. 12). Russian infantry combat formations during 
the Crimean War are shown in Fig. 12.

  The role of artillery fire rose. In the Crimean War, for 
example, a new mission began to be assigned to artillery--to 
inflict damage on enemy personnel sheltered in trenches. The 
importance of terrain fortification rose under conditions of 
position warfare. Along with the construction of poured 
earthworks (redoubts, fl&egrave;ches, lunettes), group 
emplacements 
(logements) linked by connecting passages began to be dug and 
protective cover and shelters began being built for reserves. 
The strength of the defense increased considerably through use 
of plain wire obstacles, by the arrangement of knife rests, and 
also by use of fougasses covered by artillery and infantry fire. 
  N. V. Medem's textbook "Taktika" [Tactics] (1837), which set 
forth practical recommendations on how to fight in an extended 
order in combination with column operations, played an important 
role in developing the theory and practice of interworking of 
troops in battle in the Russian Army in the 19th century. The 
textbook examined the influence of terrain conditions and other 
situation elements on the nature of interworking. These 
provisions were later developed in the work by F. I. Goremykin 
"Rukovodstvo k izucheniyu taktiki v nachalnykh yeye osnovaniyakh 
i v prakticheskom primenenii" [Manual for Study of Initial 
Foundations and Practical Application of Tactics] (1849). The 
work gave greatest attention to interworking of infantry with 
artillery. The author pointed out the perniciousness of their 
separate conduct of battle. They should be disposed on the 
battlefield, he advised, in such a way as to have an opportunity 
to help each other without constraining their actions. 
  Questions of interworking held a prominent place in works by 
G. A. Leyer "Metod voyennykh nauk" [Method of Military Sciences] 
and "Strategiya (taktika teatra voyennykh deystviy)" [Strategy 
(Tactics of a Theater of Military Operations)] (Leyer called 
this principle the principle of mutual support) and A. N. Petrov 
"K voprosam strategii" [On Questions of Strategy]. M. I. 
Dragomirov directed attention to the importance of skillful use 
of this principle. He wrote: "Each objective in war is achieved 
more surely by the combined efforts of many directed toward a 
common objective."[.sup]5[/] 
  Many forecasts on how battle would develop were expressed 
prior to World War I. Many military theorists were inclined to 
think that the infantry would continue to play a predominant 
role in it. "The battle chiefly will be the struggle of two 
infantries, and victory will be on the side of the greater 
number of battalions."[.sup]6[/] The reason for such 
erroneous theories was that little consideration was given to 
the intensive development of means of warfare. 
  The essence of changes which occurred in the material basis 
of battle was that the machinegun became a mass weapon of ground 
troops. Field artillery improved. Cannons and howitzers from 
76-mm to 152-mm in caliber became operational. Their combat 
qualities rose substantially as a result of introduction of the 
optical sight. Heavy-caliber pieces also improved, right up to 
the appearance of superpowerful, long-range guns. There was a 
sharp increase in the number of mortars, and flamethrowers 
appeared. The amount of artillery increased by 6-8 times in the 
army compared with wars of the latter half of the 19th century. 
Creation of the armored vehicle and especially the tank (1916) 
became a major step in armament development. Aircraft saw 
quantitative and qualitative development in the course of the 
war. 
  Under the influence of this, the battle assumed a combined 
arms character. Employment of various combat arms and special 
troops coordinated by objective, place and time acquired 
decisive importance in achieving success in the battle. Although 
the fire and attack capabilities of infantry units had increased 
significantly by this time in connection with their saturation 
with small-caliber artillery, mortars, medium and light 
machineguns, and flamethrowers, they were incapable of 
successfully penetrating a heavily fortified, deeply echeloned 
enemy defense without the support of artillery and aircraft. 
This was similar to the defense, in which the infantry could not 
independently repel the powerful blow of an attacking enemy, who 
began using a new means of attack in the course of war--tanks. 
  Combat experience introduced much that was new to the system 
of interworking of infantry with artillery. This experience was 
generalized in the work "Artilleriya oborony" [Defense 
Artillery], published in 1917. It stated in particular: 
"Artillery work saves infantry blood and reduces shell 
consumption. . . . It will be people who will compile and 
implement the artillery defense plan. If they do not believe in 
the possibility of using the full power of modern artillery, if 
they do not personally visit all hills, valleys and 
emplacements, if they do not study the terrain and enemy in 
detail, if they break away from the commanders of regiments and 
infantry, and if they talk with artillerymen of neighboring 
divisions and issue missions to battery commanders not on the 
terrain, but over the telephone and from a map, then the 
artillery plan will resemble a house built on sand, and 
artillery sweat that is saved will be paid for by infantry 
blood."[.sup]7[/] 
  In the offensive, artillery assisted in the infantry's 
forward movement to take up a line of departure for the attack; 
it breached barbed-wire entanglements; it demolished defensive 
works, machinegun nests, observation posts, shelters, 
emplacements and connecting passages in breakthrough sectors; it 
fought enemy artillery; and it supported the infantry assault 
and prevented enemy counterattacks. In the defense it would 
inflict losses on the enemy in repelling his assaults, support 
flanks and boundaries and the conduct of counterattacks, and 
execute a maneuver of fire to destroy a wedged-in enemy. 
  Rejected at the beginning of the war in the majority of 
armies, artillery preparation of the attack was legitimized once 
and for all in the course of the war.[.sup]8[/] In executing 
it, the artillery was employed centrally in three groups: 1) 
group for breaching barbed-wire entanglements; 2) group for 
demolishing fortifications and neutralizing the defensive fire 
plan; 3) group for combating enemy artillery. What was new in 
the interworking of infantry with artillery was that following 
artillery preparation of the attack a portion of the light 
batteries would be resubordinated to commanders of infantry 
regiments and would proceed behind the infantry to support it 
during battle in the depth of the defense.[.sup]9[/] 
  Artillery support of an infantry assault was accomplished by 
a creeping barrage, but its depth was not great. The absence of 
regimental and battalion artillery had a negative effect on 
assurance of independence of infantry subunit operations. What 
was new in organizing interworking during the fight against 
enemy artillery was that firing was conducted with the help of 
spotter aircraft, tethered balloons, and in some cases 
sound-ranging stations. 
  The first experience of infantry and artillery interworking 
with tanks and aircraft was received in the course of World War 
I. Combat employment of tanks showed that they were an effective 
means of penetrating fortified enemy positions despite their 
technical imperfection. While 32 tanks took part in the 
operation on the Somme, there already were 378 (battle tanks) in 
the operation at Cambrai and 511 at Amiens.[.sup]10[/] Rates 
of advance increased with the commitment of tanks; the tanks 
were attached to the infantry. The infantry's tactics changed, 
and it began to employ new methods of battle--shifting to a 
group combat formation and group tactics. 
  Aircraft saw much development during the war. Aviation 
initially was considered a means of supporting the 
infantry-artillery battle and it performed reconnaissance and 
spotted artillery fire. But its functions expanded with the 
appearance of ground attack, fighter and bomber aviation. By the 
end of the war aircraft were fighting for air superiority in the 
course of operations. One thousand or more aircraft took part in 
the largest ones. Tactical air defense tactics developed in the 
battle against aircraft and an air defense service was 
established. The method of firing on flying aircraft from 
machineguns and rifles saw some improvement. 
  With the predominance of positional forms of warfare, the 
cavalry faded more and more into the background as a combat arm, 
although there were examples of its major, bold 
operations.[.sup]11[/] During a breakthrough of the enemy 
defense the cavalry would dismount and be employed as infantry. 
Employing cavalry to exploit progress in an operation was 
unsuccessful, with certain exceptions. This was explained by the 
fact that the cavalry was poorly equipped with machineguns and 
artillery and could not surmount the infantry's increased fire 
resistance. 
  The role of engineer troops increased steadily during the 
war. Evidence of this was the circumstance that their proportion 
in the makeup of ground troops had increased by 1.5-2 times by 
the end of the war.[.sup]12[/] They performed various 
engineer support missions in battle. Interworking of engineer 
subunits with infantry and artillery was substantially enriched. 
Combat engineer teams would perform engineer reconnaissance in 
their support. By day such reconnaissance would be conducted by 
observation and by night sometimes by a probing reconnaissance 
patrol. The reconnaissance mission included collecting 
information about the general nature of positions; arrangement 
of emplacements, connecting passages and shelters; nature of 
barriers and obstacles; locations of machineguns and mortars; 
locations of fougasses; and degree of terrain passability in 
front of the enemy defense frontage. 
  To support the infantry's advance in an offensive, a first 
echelon regiment usually received two combat engineer platoons 
as attachment and the division received one company of a 
military road construction detachment. Special attention was 
given to breaching obstacles during an assault and during battle 
in the depth of the defense. Lanes were cleared chiefly by the 
explosive method by specially formed "demolition teams" (two 
teams for each lead assaulting company). Wire cutters, grappling 
hooks and grenades would be used for breaching during battle in 
the depth of the enemy defense. 
  In the defense, engineer units and subunits would be used 
primarily for building obstacles (barbed-wire entanglements and 
minefields). The obstacles would be deeply echeloned and several 
belts of wire entanglement netting would be prepared. The 
Russian Army used powder obstacles (fougasses) as explosive 
fougasses. They were divided into field, fortress and river 
obstacles and by technical characteristics into conventional, 
contact-detonation and repeating fougasses. They usually were 
used in barbed-wire entanglements, especially to cover dead 
zones. Fougasses were set up in two or three lines in groups of 
5-15 charges at a distance of 8-12 m from each other; the 
distance between lines was 20-30 m.[.sup]13[/] 
  Duties of unit and formation commanders in organizing 
interworking became more complicated in the course of 
development of combined arms battle in World War I. At the 
beginning of the war regimental commanders were its main 
organizers. They would assign missions to the infantry and 
artillery and coordinate their combat efforts. The role of 
division commanders was limited to assigning general missions to 
regiments, giving their commanders full initiative in organizing 
and controlling battle. With transition to positional forms of 
war, with the increased depth of combat formations and with 
development of technical means of warfare, interworking began to 
be organized according to the principle of rigid 
centralization--division commanders would delve into all details 
of battle and coordinate combat efforts among units and subunits 
of combat arms and with adjacent units. 
  The nature of interworking of Red Army troops in the Civil 
War was distinguished by great uniqueness dictated by the 
specifics of combat operations. So-called "rail war" tactics 
were used in the summer of 1918. Battles were fought primarily 
along main rail lines.[.sup]14[/] Operations of dismounted 
units and subunits were supported by guns set up on flatcars. 
  Interworking of infantry and artillery became more 
complicated with an expansion of the frontage of combat 
operations. Many divisions and brigades were forced to operate 
with a significant separation from the main body. Under these 
conditions interworking was organized in the most general terms. 
For example, in organizing for battle near Izhevsk in the fall 
of 1918, V. M. Azin, commander of the 2nd (subsequently the 
28th) Composite Division, gave subordinate commanders only a 
general mission and the final objective of operations. "You 
cannot count on my support," he said. 
  As experience was gained, combat efforts were coordinated in 
greater detail. Combat missions would be assigned to divisions 
by axes and objectives. The populated points which had to be 
taken usually were indicated to brigades (regiments). The attack 
was accomplished by march columns which, on reaching the enemy 
artillery effect zone (4-6 km), would deploy into company and 
platoon columns and then into an extended line. The assault 
would be made after a brief fire assault. For closer 
interworking with infantry, the artillery would be distributed 
by battalion among rifle regiments and brigades. Without 
becoming an organizational part of these units, the batteries or 
battalions would be assigned to them as it were and constantly 
operate with them, being directly in combat formations of the 
infantry or cavalry. 
  With consideration of situation conditions, in a number of 
cases special artillery groups which usually combined from four 
to six batteries would be established for combating enemy 
artillery. The batteries included in their makeup would be 
shifted to support rifle units after performing assigned 
missions. In this connection, decentralized control exercised 
within the framework of the battery or battalion predominated. 
Brigade and regimental commanders would decide all questions of 
interworking with their commanders. In the course of battle 
special attention would be given to coordinating operations of 
infantry with artillery, which would accompany the attackers by 
fire and wheels. The infantry in turn would cover the artillery 
against enemy cavalry assaults. 
  Rifle units would interwork with cavalry chiefly when it was 
committed to a breakthrough for pursuit of the enemy and in 
making close and deep envelopments. Operating in the enemy rear, 
the cavalry often would spread panic in his ranks, and thereby 
support the infantry's success. 
  Divisions would be reinforced by armored trains and one or 
two armored detachments on the most important axes. In 
organizing interworking with them, commanders would specify 
methods of supporting the infantry by the fire of armored trains 
and would coordinate operations of rifle units with armored 
detachments in taking populated points. Signals for denoting the 
infantry's position would be specified in organizing 
interworking with aviation. Aircraft would bomb from low 
altitudes in support of rifle units. 
  Some success in interworking of combat arms was received in 
conducting defensive battle in the Civil War. Special attention 
was given to establishing a perimeter defense around populated 
points and road junctions. Batteries and battalions would be 
attached to brigades and regiments to ensure independence of 
their operations. Coordination of efforts with artillery was 
achieved by joint disposition of observation posts and by 
setting up a unified range card and a general target and firing 
chart. Some experience was received in fighting enemy tanks. An 
artillery antitank defense system was established for the first 
time in the history of military art in 51st Rifle Division in 
the Kakhovka base of operations in 1920. 
  Special pieces were assigned to combat tanks (armored 
targets) and were not supposed to be diverted to perform other 
missions. Each antitank gun was covered by barrage fire of at 
least one light battery. Mobile batteries and platoons which 
played the role of a unique antitank reserve were used widely to 
build up the density of antitank fire. This defense proved 
insurmountable for the tanks and armored vehicles of Vrangel's 
troops. 
  Combat engineer units interworked closely with infantry and 
artillery. In a period of defensive battles they would help the 
infantry prepare defensive lines, set up obstacles, blow up 
bridges on routes of enemy advance, and demolish individual 
railroad sections. Demolition teams would be set up to perform 
demolition work. In offensive battle combat engineers would 
perform engineer reconnaissance of terrain, restore bridges, and 
build crossings over water obstacles. For example, V. I. 
Chapayev, commander of the 25th Rifle Division, assigned combat 
engineer subunits the following missions in an assault crossing 
of the Belaya River south of Ufa in June 1918: Perform engineer 
reconnaissance of the river in the crossing sector; repair the 
damaged ferry for crossing armored vehicles; build landings 
(docks) on both banks of the river; and repair the road from the 
armored vehicle unloading site to the ferry 
crossing.[.sup]15[/] 
  The experience of interworking accumulated by the Red Army 
in 
the Civil War was reflected in regulation documents published at 
that time--the "Stroyevoy pekhotnyy ustav RKKA" [Workers' and 
Peasants' Red Army Infantry Drill Regulations] (1920), "Ustav 
artillerii RKKA" [RKKA Artillery Regulations] (1920), "Ustav 
rotnykh pulemetov RKKA" [RKKA Light Machinegun Regulations] 
(1920) and also in the work "Boyevoye primeneniye strelkovoy 
divizii i vysshikh kavaleriyskikh soyedineniy" [Combat 
Employment of Rifle Divisions and the Highest Cavalry 
Formations] (1920). 
  There was no pause in the arms race following the end of 
World War I. To the contrary, it was conducted at 
unprecedentedly high rates. In relatively short time periods the 
technical outfitting of armies of the leading world countries 
was upgraded and replaced almost completely. Of ground troops' 
armament, one should note above all the rapidly improving 
armored equipment. In the late 1930's and early 1940's medium 
and heavy tanks appeared with improved hull shape and armor, a 
high speed (45-65 km/hr), a considerable range (up to 500 km), 
powerful armor protection (100 mm or more), and heavy armament 
(from 76-mm to 122-mm guns and heavy-caliber machineguns). 
  Field artillery was improved--guns and howitzers (from 76-mm 
to 203-mm) as well as mortars (from 82-mm to 160-mm), antitank 
artillery (from 45-mm to 100-mm), antitank guns, and 
antiaircraft artillery (from 37-mm to 85-mm). New machineguns 
and submachineguns (assault rifles) were adopted. Antitank and 
antipersonnel mines became widespread. Tank, mechanized, 
airborne and artillery divisions and corps as well as other 
units appeared in the makeup of the ground troops. Aviation 
developed intensively, especially during World War II. New 
fighters, ground attack aircraft, medium and long-range 
(strategic) bombers, long-range reconnaissance aircraft, 
military-transport aircraft and gliders appeared. 
  The theory and practice of interworking by Soviet troops 
were 
upgraded in the interwar period with consideration of the 
qualitative renewal of the material base of combined arms 
battle. This process did not occur without contradictions. On 
the one hand, based on prevision of the nature of future war, 
Soviet military thinking developed a scientifically grounded 
concept of balanced Armed Forces development. In contrast to 
one-sided foreign military theories of "air war" and "tank war," 
which overestimated the role of individual combat arms in 
performing missions in the operation and battle, our military 
art firmly adhered to the idea of coordinated, massive 
employment of branches of the Armed Forces and combat arms to 
rout the enemy and achieve the assigned objectives. On the other 
hand, adherence to Civil War experience dominated and proper 
priorities in development of weapons were not always chosen. 
  Questions of interworking were set forth for the first time 
in the most generalized form in the 1925 Field Service 
Regulations, which emphasized that coordination in operations of 
combat arms and various units and detachments operating on 
different axes is a necessary condition for success. Inasmuch as 
the Red Army had few tanks and aircraft at that time, the 
Regulations gave no consideration to their support. Artillery 
was regarded as the basic means for fire suppression of the 
enemy. According to the Regulations, in penetrating an organized 
enemy defense it was deemed necessary to have a treble 
superiority over the enemy in personnel and equipment. 
  Subsequently the system of interworking was developed and 
significantly supplemented and updated in the 1929 Field Service 
Regulations, the 1936 RKKA Provisional Field Service 
Regulations, and the 1939, 1940 and 1941 draft Red Army Field 
Service Regulations. These regulations examined questions of 
organizing interworking not only in rifle, but also in 
mechanized, cavalry and motorized formations. 
  In addition to regulation documents, much influence on 
improving the theory and practice of interworking was exerted by 
works of M. N. Tukhachevskiy "Novoye v razvitii taktiki Krasnoy 
Armii" [New Things in Development of Red Army Tactics], V. K. 
Triandafillov "Kharakter operatsiy sovremennykh armiy" [Nature 
of Operations of Modern Armies], G. S. Isserson "Istoricheskiye 
korni glubokoy taktiki" [Historical Roots of Deep Tactics], the 
collective work of the Frunze Military Academy "Organizatsiya i 
vedeniye nastupatelnogo boya" [Organization and Conduct of 
Offensive Battle], S. K. Timoshenko "O takticheskoy podgotovke 
voysk" [On Tactical Training of Troops], A. G. Lignau 
"Vzaimodeystviye ognya i zhivoy sily v nastupatelnom boyu" 
[Interworking of Fire and Personnel in Offensive Battle], A. I. 
Sedyakin "Blizhniy boy" [Close Combat], S. M. Budennyy 
"Znacheniye konnitsy i osnovy yeye taktiki" [Importance of 
Cavalry and Fundamentals of Its Tactics], the collective work 
edited by V. D. Grendal "Artilleriya v nastupatelnom boyu" 
[Artillery in Offensive Battle], K. B. Kalinovskiy "Tanki v 
gruppakh DD" [Tanks in Long Range Groups], A. P. Lapchinskiy 
"Vozdushnyy boy" [Air-to-Air Combat], and D. M. Karbyshev 
"Inzhenernoye obespecheniye obshchevoyskovogo boya" [Engineer 
Support to Combined arms Battle]. 
  Many questions of theory and practice of troop interworking 
in that period were resolved by Soviet military thought in a 
fundamentally new way based on the theory of deep battle set 
forth in the instructions "Vremennyye ukazaniya po organizatsii 
glubokogo boya" [Provisional Directions on Organizing Deep 
Battle] (1933). Subsequently, it was also based on the theory of 
the deep operation. Briefly, the essence of the system of 
interworking in accomplishing a deep operation reduced to the 
following. Rifle formations reinforced by tanks and supported by 
artillery and aircraft make a break-in of a positional enemy 
defensive front; when the front is disrupted, motorized and 
mechanized units (mechanized corps and brigades) are committed, 
they advance swiftly into the depth of the enemy defense 
together with airborne assault forces, rout army reserves and 
take tactically important objectives (rear-area logistic support 
bases, airfields, transportation hubs). Cavalry supported by 
aircraft attacks shallower reserves, seizes light aviation 
airfields, and destroys retreating enemy rear 
services.[.sup]16[/] 
  But it is impossible to be silent about the fact that not 
all 
questions of interworking were resolved correctly in our 
regulation documents and works. Thus, for a long time the 
cavalry was advanced to the fore to the detriment of development 
of armored troops. The role of infantry in combined arms battle 
was also exaggerated. The textbook "Obshchaya taktika" [General 
Tactics], published on the eve of the war,[.sup]17[/] stated: 
"All interworking is organized in support of infantry (which 
performs the principal role in battle)." Dividing the combat 
formation of formations and units in the offensive into striking 
forces and holding forces proved impractical. 
  Many miscalculations were made in organizing the 
interworking 
of artillery with infantry. It was envisaged to establish 
artillery groups for a specific purpose. For example, 
infantry-support artillery groups were established in the 
division based on the number of rifle regiments operating in the 
first echelon, and long-range artillery groups were established 
in corps based on the number of first echelon divisions. 
Artillery would be subordinated to regimental and battalion 
commanders only "when, based on ground observation conditions, 
it becomes difficult to support an offensive by centrally 
controlled fire."[.sup]18[/] As shown by Great Patriotic War 
experience, rigid centralization in controlling artillery led to 
where regiments and battalions essentially ended up without 
artillery support in the course of a battle. 
  The established procedure for initiating the assault did not 
facilitate precise interworking between infantry and artillery. 
The 1936 "Vremennyy polevoy ustav RKKA" [Workers' and Peasants' 
Red Army Provisional Field Service Regulations] directed that 
the infantry should make an assault dash when the artillery 
transfers fire into the depth of the defense. In practice this 
led during the war to where a gap in time was created between 
fire and the movement of infantry. Taking advantage of this, the 
enemy often managed to poise to repel an assault. Subsequently 
this provision was corrected based on combat experience. 
  Questions of interworking in defensive battle were not 
developed completely enough in prewar times. The Field Service 
Regulations gave no consideration to coordinated operations of 
troops in repelling a surprise enemy attack, to the procedure 
for restoring combat effectiveness, or to questions of 
interworking when destroying enemy groupings wedged in at 
boundaries and on flanks, when they made close and deep 
envelopments, during a withdrawal, and in fighting in 
encirclement. 
  The fact that regulation documents underestimated the 
combined arms commander's role in organizing interworking was an 
especially big mistake. Thus, the 1935 "Nastavleniye po polevoy 
sluzhbe shtabov" [Manual of Staff Field Duties] pointed out that 
the chief of staff personally organizes and ensures interworking 
of troops. It was recommended that the commander give only 
general instructions for organizing interworking. All these and 
many other miscalculations in questions of interworking had a 
negative effect on the course of Soviet troop combat operations 
in the first period of war. 
  The process of improving the system of interworking when 
Soviet troops conducted combat operations in the 
Great Patriotic War followed difficult paths. An analysis of our 
failures with the beginning of the war shows that most often 
they resulted from poor preparation for combat and the absence 
of reliable interworking among the combat arms involved. Only in 
1941 did the Headquarters, Supreme High Command [Hq SHC] issue 
several directives on this matter. Thus, one published in August 
noted that combined arms commanders and staffs were doing 
extremely poorly in coordinating the actions of infantry and 
artillery with tanks and combat engineers. Interworking was 
being organized in general outlines not on the terrain, but from 
a map; it was being worked out to a shallow depth without 
considering troop combat capabilities; missions were being 
assigned in an ill-conceived manner; and combat efforts of units 
and subunits were being poorly coordinated for destroying an 
enemy wedged in at boundaries and flanks.[.sup]19[/] 
  The directives indicated that the principal reason for the 
inability of many combined arms commanders to organize 
interworking was that they had a poor knowledge of combat 
capabilities of the combat arms. Not knowing how the combat arms 
should be employed in battle, they naturally could not demand 
that subordinate commanders employ them properly.[.sup]20[/] 
  A genuine scourge for troops in the first period of war was 
the knowingly unrealistic assignment of missions to divisions, 
regiments and battalions. Thus, in a directive to troops during 
the battles at Smolensk (1941), 19th Army Chief of Staff Major 
General P. N. Rubtsov instructed: "...Trouble continues to occur 
in calculating time and space. The desire to execute an assigned 
combat mission as quickly as possible often obscures common 
sense, and troops are assigned missions of which they clearly 
are incapable."[.sup]21[/] 
  It is typical that the command element's instructions not 
only noted shortcomings that occurred in organization of 
interworking, but also spelled out specific ways of remedying 
them. For example, a 29 September 1941 Hq SHC directive pointed 
out: "In organizing interworking, commanders must know precisely 
the force composition and missions of supporting artillery, 
tanks and aviation . . . assign missions to subordinates 
personally on the terrain, and clarify targets for assault, 
suppression and destruction."[.sup]22[/] 
  The 1942 "Boyevoy ustav pekhoty" [Infantry Field Manual] and 
the 1943 draft "Polevoy ustav" [Field Service Regulations] 
played a role of great importance in improving the system of 
interworking in the troops. With consideration of accumulated 
combat experience, they set forth recommendations on how troop 
combat efforts should be coordinated. Thus, the "Polevoy ustav" 
noted that combat missions for the offensive must be assigned in 
such a way that at least 24 hours remain before it begins, 
division or brigade commanders must be given at least 12 hours 
for organizing for battle, and battalion commanders must be 
given at least 3 hours of daylight for work on the terrain. 
  In the third period of the war certain corrections to the 
work of organizing interworking were made based on requirements 
of the "Nastavleniye po proryvu pozitsionnoy oborony" [Manual 
for Breakthrough of a Position Defense]. It prescribed 
allocating a corps commander at least two days, a division 
commander just as much, and regimental and battalion commanders 
at least 24 hours each for organizing interworking. 
Recommendations on developing an operational timetable in the 
division which should detail what mission rifle units, 
artillery, tankers and combat engineers should perform and how 
they should do so in a particular stage of battle were new. 
  Interworking in defensive battle was organized by options of 
conducting the battle, by missions, and by axes of enemy 
operations.[.sup]23[/] For example, in the defense at Moscow 
in November 1941 the commander of 5th Army's 32nd Rifle Division 
coordinated combat efforts for such missions as support to the 
battle of combat outposts, the battle for the FEBA and for 
holding populated points, and battle in the depth of defense. 
  Combat missions were updated subsequently as combat 
experience accumulated. Thus, in the defense at Kursk 
interworking was organized in 15th and 81st guards rifle 
divisions and in 73rd and 213th rifle divisions for the 
following missions: Battle on approaches to the defense and 
prohibition of enemy forward movement into the assault; repulse 
of an enemy assault and the battle to hold the FEBA; the battle 
to destroy a wedged-in enemy; conduct of counterattacks and 
restoration of the defense. 
  And so, a number of trends can be traced in organizing 
interworking in the war years. Its content was significantly 
expanded and enriched. The transition from artillery support to 
artillery offensive became fundamentally new in the interworking 
of artillery with infantry and tanks, and the effectiveness of 
fire damage of the enemy increased as a result. Regulation 
documents pointed out that the essence of the artillery 
offensive "is continuous support to infantry by massed, 
effective artillery and mortar fire throughout the entire period 
of the offensive. Artillery and mortar fire should lead the 
infantry and tanks into the assault from one objective in the 
defense to another."[.sup]24[/] 
  Artillery preparation of the assault usually was planned to 
a 
depth of 3-4 km within a time frame of 1.5-2 hours. What was new 
in planning artillery support was that the mission was executed 
not only by the method of a successive fire concentration, but 
also by a rolling barrage (single or double and sometimes even 
triple), up to a depth of 2 km. 
  During the war, the Soviet command began to see a need for 
reinforcing attacking rifle and tank subunits with close-support 
artillery. Subunits and units of self-propelled artillery 
(SAU-76, SU-122, ISU-152) were established for this and were 
attached to tank subunits as accompanying close-support guns for 
combating enemy antitank and other weapons. The 45-mm and 57-mm 
antitank guns and 76-mm regimental guns, which displaced on the 
battlefield as individual gun crews, were used in rifle 
battalions as accompanying close-support guns. 
  The main air efforts were aimed at winning air superiority, 
reconnoitering the enemy, and assisting combined arms formations 
in defeating him. In the second and third periods of the war, 
Air Force operations were accomplished in the form of an air 
offensive, the basis of which was air preparation of the 
assault, support of an infantry and tank assault, and 
accompaniment of attacking troops in the depth of the enemy 
defense. 
  The landing and operations of airborne assault forces 
represented a fundamentally new phenomenon in World War II (a 
total of 150 major assault landings were made). Airborne assault 
forces would be landed most often in an offensive operation to 
assist the main troop grouping in defeating the enemy. 
Interworking with it was organized on an operational and 
strategic scale. 
  The interworking of tanks with infantry and artillery 
continuously improved during the war. Tank units and subunits 
attached to rifle divisions and regiments would be employed as 
infantry direct-support tanks. Their operations would be planned 
by lines and missions. Directive instructions emphasized that 
tanks should not separate from the infantry by more than 200-400 
m and the infantry should "suppress enemy antitank weapons with 
the full power of their fire as well as by the fire of 
accompanying close-support guns, reconnoiter and clear 
minefields, . . . combat German tank destroyers, decisively 
follow tanks into the assault, consolidate captured lines..." 
Artillery was assigned missions of combating enemy tanks. It was 
emphasized that "tanks fight tanks only in case of a clear 
superiority in forces and when the situation is 
favorable."[.sup]25[/] 
  Interworking of air defense units and subunits with rifle, 
artillery and tank units was accomplished with great difficulty: 
The acute shortage of antiaircraft artillery [AAA] was felt in 
the troops. At the beginning of the war one AAA battalion (8 
37-mm and 4 76-mm AA guns) was envisaged in the makeup of each 
rifle division and corps. A division could establish a density 
of 1.2 guns per kilometer on a frontage of 10 km with organic 
weapons, but even this insufficient density was not always 
established in view of being understrength in weapons. The 
shortage of AAA in the first period of the war forced wide use 
of small arms and passive measures of protection--maskirovka, 
dispersal, use of protective terrain features, engineer 
preparation of terrain--to combat aircraft. 
  Armies began establishing AAA groups beginning with the 
second period of the war. This achieved centralization of 
command and control, massing, and convenience of interworking of 
AAA. The density of AAA cover increased to 10 guns per kilometer 
of frontage or 1-1.5 guns per square kilometer of the area 
covered. In the middle of 1944 some rifle divisions received a 
separate AAA battalion consisting of 12 37-mm guns and an 
antiaircraft company consisting of 18 DShK [Degtyarev-Shpagin 
heavy] machineguns. 
  The experience of organizing the interworking of air defense 
personnel and equipment with other combat arms was reflected in 
the 1944 "Rukovodstvo po boyevomu primeneniyu sredstv PVO pri 
obespechenii voysk" [Manual for Combat Employment of Air Defense 
Weapons in Support of Troops]. It noted that the air defense 
system included the following: Timely enemy air raid warning to 
troops, a VNOS [air observation, warning and communications] 
service, AAA and machinegun fire plan, fighter combat 
operations, and a plan for organized small arms fire. The 
combined arms commander was responsible for organizing air 
defense. 
  In the offensive, air defense weapons concentrated efforts 
on 
covering troops delivering the main attack. Displacing by 
echelon (no more than one-third of batteries simultaneously), 
they were at the following distance from forward units: AA 
machineguns no further than 800-1,000 m, light AAA 1.5-2 km and 
medium AAA 3 km. In covering troops, AAA would proceed in troop 
combat formations in trying to achieve air defense continuity. 
AA machineguns and small-caliber guns always were in readiness 
to fire from the move and from short halts. In the defense, air 
defense weapons had the primary mission of disrupting enemy air 
preparation and not allowing reconnaissance or air strikes 
against artillery positions, reserves, staffs and rear-area 
facilities. 
  During the war abundant experience was gained in 
interworking 
of engineer troops with other combat arms. Operating as part of 
mobile obstacle detachments, assault detachments and teams, and 
movement support detachments or performing independent missions, 
engineer units and subunits would support operations of rifle, 
tank and artillery units and subunits in all kinds of battle. In 
interworking with them, the engineer units and subunits would 
cover flanks, consolidate captured lines, assist troops in 
repelling enemy counterattacks, and support the troops' forward 
movement and maneuver and their establishment of a stable 
defense. Engineer subunits' increased role in battle is 
indicated by the circumstance that in 1945 a rifle division 
began to have up to 12 combat engineer companies. In some 
operations their density rose to 4-6 companies per kilometer of 
frontage.[.sup]26[/] 
  The combined arms commander was the primary organizer of 
interworking in the war. At the same time, the staff played an 
important role in this matter. The 1942 "Nastavleniye po polevoy 
sluzhbe shtabov" [Manual on Staff Field Duties] emphasized that 
a staff which cannot support interworking cannot be deemed a 
full-fledged command and control entity. The staff's duties in 
organizing interworking included the following: Preparing data 
on the combat situation and necessary calculations; coordinating 
questions of interworking with chiefs of combat arms (services) 
and with adjacent units; supporting the commander's work in 
organizing interworking on the terrain, on terrain models or on 
maps; and communicating his instructions to units. In addition, 
the staff would provide uninterrupted communications among 
interworking units and would establish a unified system of 
warning and target designation signals, develop necessary combat 
documentation, and monitor how interworking was organized in 
subordinate units and subunits. 
  An important role in coordinating combat efforts during the 
war was given to tactical drill problems, field-fire exercises, 
command and staff exercises, staff officer radio drills, and 
joint problems for commanders of rifle, tank, artillery and air 
units. In noting the great benefit of such activities at a 
conference critiquing the Silesian Operation, the commander of 
2nd Guards Army noted: "We began holding joint exercises 15-20 
days before the operation began. . . . Subsequently, in the 
period of joint ground reconnaissance, combat arms officers were 
very satisfied and pleasantly surprised by the fact that they 
were training together in problems and would go into battle 
together. They knew each other and developed a certain trust and 
mutual understanding, and this was very valuable for 
battle."[.sup]27[/] 
  On the whole, the Great Patriotic War enriched the theory 
and 
practice of troop interworking and elevated it to a new level. 
Soviet commanders and staffs proved equal to their missions. 
They displayed creative initiative in seeking new, 
nonstereotyped methods of coordinating troop combat efforts 
depending on the situation at hand. As a rule, their activity 
was characterized by depth of concepts, preciseness of 
calculations and comprehensive prudence. 
  Combat experience showed that commanders' proficiency alone 
was not enough to achieve precise, continuous interworking in 
battle. High combat proficiency of privates and NCO's and their 
ability to make effective use of their weapons' combat 
capabilities and act in coordination--conduct fire accurately, 
transfer it promptly to new targets, and carry out mutual 
assistance in battle--also were required. No less important were 
the personnel's high morale and fighting qualities, persistence, 
composure, and an unbending will to win. 
  Qualitative improvement of the material base of combined 
arms 
formations largely helped upgrade the system of interworking of 
Soviet troops. Thus, during 1943-1944, for example, the 
numerical strength of personnel of the army in the field rose by 
a little more than 6 percent, but the number of guns and mortars 
which they had rose by 40 percent, the number of tanks and 
self-propelled artillery by 90 percent, and the number of 
aircraft almost fourfold.[.sup]28[/] It is typical that the 
proportion of the numerical strength of different combat arms in 
the rifle division by the end of the war increased to 50-60 
percent, while it did not exceed 20 percent in infantry 
divisions in World War I. 
  According to the "Troop Leadership" manual, interworking in 
the fascist German Army was considered one of the 
chief tactical principles. Military command element orders 
emphasized that personnel, equipment or time should not be 
spared to achieve uniformity, precision, coordination of 
operations and punctuality in executing missions. From 12 hours 
to 2 days were allocated for coordinating questions of 
interworking in the division in preparing an 
offensive.[.sup]29[/] Principal attention in the offensive 
was given to close interworking of infantry, tanks, artillery 
and aircraft. Tanks would clear the way for motorized infantry, 
which would consolidate success. The tank and motorized reserve 
intended for exploiting success and accomplishing sudden 
missions that arose would move behind the motorized infantry in 
a wedge combat formation. 
  During the war many corrections were made to the system of 
interworking of combined arms units by the fascist German 
troops' military command. An assault most often was executed 
simultaneously by tanks and motorized infantry with continuous 
accompaniment by aircraft. After artillery preparation of the 
assault, artillery and mortars would switch to artillery support 
of the assault, which was executed by a successive fire 
concentration or rolling barrage. Target designation and mutual 
coordination of infantry and tank operations with artillery and 
aircraft were distinguished by great precision. 
  In the defense, the combat efforts of combat arms were aimed 
at routing the enemy ahead of the forward edge of the "main 
battlefield" or at the very least inside the main defensive 
zone. To this end, in coordination with aircraft, artillery 
would prepare long-range fires on road junctions, chokepoints, 
and crossings. The most dangerous axes, boundaries and flanks 
would be covered by a fixed barrage. The infantry would 
establish a zone of massed, continuous rifle and machinegun fire 
ahead of the FEBA. Tanks and self-propelled artillery would be 
employed as fixed weapon emplacements and roving guns. 
  Questions of interworking were developed only in a general 
way in prewar U.S. Army field manuals. It is 
characteristic that tanks were not singled out as an independent 
combat arm. Their operations were covered in the "Infantry" 
sections. The Air Force, to the contrary, was separated out. It 
trained for independent operations. Tactical interworking of 
aircraft with ground troops on the battlefield was 
underestimated. The Americans paid for these and other 
miscalculations with losses in the first battles. 
  During the war commanders and staffs gave great attention to 
coordinating combat efforts of the combat arms. In organizing a 
breakthrough of the enemy defense, special attention was given 
to its reliable fire suppression in support of infantry and tank 
operations. To this end, a large number of aircraft were used 
for fire preparation of the assault in addition to artillery. 
Thus, 300-400 and sometimes even up to 500 tons of bombs per 
square kilometer were allocated to support an army corps 
offensive. 
  British Army wartime field manuals reflected the 
principle of interworking rather completely, but it was not 
always skillfully realized in practice. Offensive operations in 
the El Alamein area (1942) can serve as an example. Despite the 
fact that the British surpassed Italian-German troops by 1.5 
times in personnel, by 2 times in tanks and artillery and by 
several times in aircraft, the offensive was carried out at a 
low rate because of poor coordination of tank and infantry 
efforts with artillery and also inflexible command and control. 
In particular, aircraft were not used effectively. Bombing was 
not against targets, but areas. Air strikes did not conclude 
with an assault by ground troops. Artillery fire also was 
conducted against areas. And when guns and mortars fell silent 
and aircraft stopped flying sorties, the infantry and tanks, 
left without fire support, would launch an assault and suffer 
losses from enemy fire. 
  Interworking of British troops was accomplished rather 
precisely in subsequent operations. Operations of infantry, 
tanks and artillery were tied in skillfully with aircraft in 
accomplishing "close air support," which corresponded to our 
concept of the "air offensive." 
  Japanese Army tactics were characterized by great 
independence of operations by lightly armed detachments, 
especially in jungles and on mountainous terrain. The full 
burden of battle fell on the infantry. Artillery would conduct 
fire against areas; moreover, there was little artillery. The 
shortage of artillery was made up for by air operations; tanks 
were not employed everywhere. For example, tank troops did not 
see wide employment in combat operations in the southern seas. 
Only light tanks and light field artillery were used in battles. 
  In a defensive battle the Japanese relied chiefly on the 
staunchness of their infantry. The strong side of their defense 
was the troops' ability to adapt to terrain, make wide use of 
obstacles and ambushes, and make daring sallies into the enemy 
rear. Special raiding parties were established to destroy 
artillery batteries. Deceptive actions often were used in the 
defense, and fire would be opened from short range. Surprise 
counterattacks were widely employed, especially at night. On the 
whole, the defense was distinguished by great tenacity. In many 
cases defensive positions were defended to the last soldier. 
  The system of interworking saw some development in 
local wars. The employment of new kinds of weapons 
(jet aviation, combat helicopters, antitank and surface-to-air 
missile systems, new types of artillery, tanks, IFV's, homing 
munitions, fuel-air bombs and so on) dictated the appearance of 
new methods for coordinating combat efforts of personnel and 
equipment. For example, the complexity of interworking of ground 
troops with aviation increased sharply. Flights at supersonic 
speed hampered delivery of strikes against small targets near 
friendly troops due to brief time over the target and the 
difficulty of identifying it. 
  In connection with the conduct of airmobile operations, the 
need arose to organize interworking among motorized infantry, 
tanks, artillery and the combat and transport-attack helicopters 
which landed airborne assault forces and provided fire support. 
  The importance of the time factor rose substantially in 
coordinating combat efforts under the new conditions. Staff use 
of automated control systems simplified the solution to some 
planning questions, and especially facilitated performance of 
complex operational-tactical calculations. Based on an analysis 
of the Vietnam War experience, American specialists concluded 
that the time for planning combat operations for certain 
missions is reduced from 10 hours to 10 minutes using automated 
control systems.[.sup]30[/] 
  It can be seen from the above that the system of troop 
interworking underwent a complicated evolution over many 
centuries of the development of military art. Much accumulated 
experience remains significant even now. But weapons are 
changing and troop interworking changes; therefore past 
experience can be viewed only as a small step in ascending to 
new levels of combat perfection. 
<H5>  2. Principle of Interworking in Defensive Battle </H5>
  Experience in organizing and accomplishing interworking 
gained by Soviet troops in the Great Patriotic War served as the 
foundation, the starting point, for upgrading its system under 
present conditions. The principle of interworking is especially 
sensitive to changes in the material base of combined arms 
battle. Outfitting troops with new weapons and increasing their 
fire, striking, maneuver and protective qualities demand new 
approaches to realizing this and other principles in battle. 
  This section sets the goal of tracing how the content of 
interworking and conditions for its organization in modern 
defensive battle are changing and what new factors are 
influencing work methods of commanders and staffs, and on this 
basis developing certain practical recommendations for command 
and control entities in coordinating troop combat efforts. 
  The system of troop interworking presently functioning and 
reflected in field manuals is the result of lengthy historical 
development. Many provisions on interworking in prewar Red Army 
Field Service Regulations were viewed completely differently 
than now. For example, it was believed that combat efforts of 
combat arms and elements of the combat formation should be 
coordinated by lines and objectives in the 
defense.[.sup]31[/] But that procedure of interworking was 
refuted by combat experience during the Great Patriotic War. 
This happened because "lines and objectives" are a very vague, 
nonspecific concept. It often turned out that each of the 
interworking commanders would designate them at his own 
discretion, which did not contribute to achieving uniformity of 
understanding of the objective of operations in battle, and this 
is the primary task in organizing interworking. Therefore it was 
determined in the course of the war that it was more advisable 
to organize interworking in the defense not by lines, but by 
missions being performed by troops.[.sup]32[/] This permitted 
tying in troop operations more purposefully in conducting 
battle. Subsequently, in addition to coordinating efforts by 
missions, it also was deemed necessary to organize interworking 
by options of defensive battle and by axes of enemy operations. 
  In principle, with some updating, this system of organizing 
interworking in the defense also is deemed advisable for present 
conditions. Thus, the "Boyevoy ustav Sukhoputnykh voysk" [Ground 
Troops Field Manual] presently in force states: "The battalion 
(company) commander organizes interworking by missions, probable 
axes of enemy advance, and options of subunit 
operations."[.sup]33[/] 
  But while the logical schematic for coordinating troop 
combat 
efforts in the modern defense basically remains the same, the 
content of interworking and work methods of commanders and 
staffs in organizing it are changing substantially. Much has 
appeared here that is new. The expansion in spatial limits of 
battle has a great influence on the system of interworking. 
Thus, in determining the probable nature of enemy operations, it 
is now no longer possible, as in the past, to be limited to 
considering only that enemy grouping directly facing a formation 
or unit. 
  Proper coordination of defending troops' combat efforts 
requires anticipating what personnel and equipment the attacker 
can commit in conducting not only close combat, but also 
long-range battle. It is a question above all of means of 
nuclear attack, reconnaissance-strike and reconnaissance-fire 
complexes, and remote minelaying and EW equipment, the bulk of 
which is at the disposal of formation commanders and is 
dispersed at a considerable distance from the front line and in 
a broad zone. 
  The circumstance that modern battle has assumed a land-air 
nature also substantially affects the character of interworking. 
While in the World War II period a division commander preparing 
calculation data for coordinating troop combat efforts chiefly 
estimated the opposing enemy ground grouping and would estimate 
the air situation only in general, now, when combat operations 
on land and in the air comprise a single whole and are waged 
with identically high combat intensity, in coordinating troop 
combat efforts it is important to consider enemy use of tactical 
aviation, whose scale of employment is becoming ever broader, as 
shown by the experience of NATO troop exercises and Operation 
Desert Storm. Thus, a U.S. division is assigned 120-140 sorties 
for a day of battle.[.sup]34[/] 
  The landing of airborne assault forces is becoming massive. 
The U.S. command views them as an important element in realizing 
the "deep strike" concept. Based on NATO troop exercise 
experience, tactical airborne landings are made to a depth of 
60-70 km at brigade strength from the army corps, to 15-20 km at 
battalion strength from the division, and to 5-7 km at company 
strength from the brigade. In addition, wide use of raiding and 
reconnaissance units is envisaged. For example, up to 60 such 
teams are assigned from each Ranger battalion, 24 raiding and 
reconnaissance detachments from the army corps deep 
reconnaissance company, and 50-100 such detachments from a 
special-purpose team.[.sup]35[/] 
  Under those conditions the system for interworking of 
defending troops must be especially flexible. In coordinating 
combat operations, the division commander must take into account 
that aggressive combat operations can take in the full depth of 
the tactical defense zone simultaneously from the very beginning 
of battle. Based on this, it is necessary to provide for the 
possibility of units and subunits performing diverse sudden 
missions that arise and to tie in operations of all combat 
formation elements in such a way that they can repel enemy 
strikes not only from the front, but also from the flanks and 
rear, fight in encirclement, and combine positional and mobile 
forms of warfare. 
  Increased complexity of the mine situation has no small 
influence on interworking of troops in modern battle. It is 
common knowledge that the concept of "mine warfare" was 
officially incorporated in U.S. Army regulations in the 
mid-1980's. The most important role in it was set aside for use 
of remote minelaying systems and remotely laid minefields. Thus, 
according to U.S. command views, remotely laid minefields will 
make up 80 percent of the total volume of obstacles emplaced in 
an air-land offensive operation.[.sup]36[/] 
  In coordinating troop operations it is important to take 
into 
account when, in what stage of battle, for what purpose, against 
what area and by what method the attacking enemy may employ 
remote minelaying systems and accordingly think out questions of 
how to organize observation and a mine danger warning to troops, 
how to reconnoiter remotely laid minefields, how to clear lanes 
in them, and also what the procedure is for restoring unit and 
subunit combat effectiveness after the enemy delivers a massive 
fire strike by remote minelaying systems. 
  Tactical exercise experience shows that in connection with 
the expanded spatial scope of modern battle, the combined arms 
formation commander must have data on the enemy grouping 
disposed on a territory 2-3 times larger than the division area 
of responsibility for a full situation estimate in support of 
decisionmaking and organization of interworking. In short, now 
he is obligated to keep an eye on the enemy continuously not 
only at the tactical but also at the operational level. It 
stands to reason that data of the situation taking shape in 
zones of adjacent units must be communicated to the commander by 
the adjacent units and by higher headquarters. 
  The end result of the enemy estimate in support of 
organization of interworking should be an identification of axes 
of his delivery of the main attack and other attacks, 
identification of the makeup and nature of operations by 
groupings on each axis, and possible methods of his delivery of 
fire strikes and execution of a maneuver of personnel and 
equipment on the ground and by air. 
  The interests of interworking in modern defensive battle 
demand that forecasting of the nature of friendly troop 
operations be more comprehensive and on a larger scale. This is 
connected with the fact that tactics depends on operational art 
and strategy now as never before. The division is capable of 
accomplishing many combat missions only in close interworking 
with operational-level assets which combat enemy aviation, 
reconnaissance-strike complexes, cruise missiles, robotized 
weapons and EW assets; disrupt his system for command and 
control of troops and weapons; provide reliable air and 
antilanding defense and so on. 
  Consequently, in making the decision for battle and in 
organizing interworking, the division commander should have a 
clear picture of the role and place of his formation in the 
operation and its capabilities to perform the assigned combat 
mission, and know how interworking is organized with the senior 
commander's personnel and equipment and with adjacent units, 
especially in such matters as disrupting or weakening an enemy 
precision weapons strike; combating his aircraft, 
reconnaissance, airborne assault forces and EW assets; 
conducting counterpreparation fire; prohibiting the forward 
movement of attack groupings from forming-up places to the final 
coordination line; and also providing protection of friendly 
command and control systems and electronics against enemy 
jamming. 
  In analyzing conditions affecting the organization of 
interworking in modern defensive battle, it is important to note 
the increased volume and complexity of tasks being performed in 
coordinating combat efforts and at the same time the sharp 
reduction in time set aside for carrying them out. While 3-4 
days most often were allocated in the Great Patriotic War for 
organizing interworking at the division-regimental level in 
preparing a defense in the absence of immediate contact with the 
enemy, now a matter of hours will be set aside for this purpose, 
especially in the initial period of war. 
  It is necessary to call attention to the fact that in making 
decisions and organizing interworking, the commander and staff 
now must collect, generalize and process approximately 4-5 times 
more information than in the past war. Information has become 
more complex in content, and collecting and evaluating it 
require greater efforts. This is dictated by the fact that the 
combat operations zone of formations and units has increased by 
many times. For example, while a division in the Great Patriotic 
War defended a zone 10-12 km wide and 6-8 km deep and the area 
of its "combat zone" was 60-100 km[.sup]2[/], a division now 
receives a defensive area 30-40 km or more wide and 20-30 km 
deep based on NATO troop exercise experience.[.sup]37[/] 
Accordingly, the territory on which formation defensive 
operations unfold increased to 600-1,200 km[.sup]2[/], which 
exceeds the division "combat zone" in the past war by 10-12 
times. 
  With consideration of the increased number of missions for 
collecting, processing and analyzing information and performing 
operational-tactical calculations in order to organize 
interworking, a decisive role belongs to simulation of combat 
operations and to skilled, creative use of computers by 
officials of command and control entities. Above all, performing 
calculation and information tasks using computers involves 
assessing combat capabilities of units and subunits, the 
quantitative and qualitative ratio of the sides' personnel and 
equipment by axes and by successively performed missions, and 
personnel and equipment densities being established; assessing 
the effectiveness of enemy nuclear and fire damage; establishing 
a fire plan; determining methods of combat employment of field 
artillery, air defense weapons and army aviation; assessing 
capabilities of tactical reconnaissance and EW; and organizing 
engineer and logistic support. 
  In organizing interworking it must be taken into account 
that 
defensive battle usually begins with a repulse of a massive 
enemy air strike, which can immediately encompass all elements 
of the troop combat alignment. The attacker obviously will 
concentrate his main efforts on destroying weapons; facilities 
for command and control of troops and weapons; targets of the 
antitank defense, air defense and antilanding defense systems; 
as well as troops defending in main and second defense zones and 
reserves. Taking this into account, top-priority measures in 
coordinating troop combat operations are aimed at creating 
favorable conditions for delivering a massive surprise 
retaliatory fire strike against the enemy and preserving 
stability of the defense, no matter what. 
  Based on tactical exercise experience, in organizing 
interworking in this stage special attention is given to 
ensuring troop survivability by a sensible alignment of the 
combat formation of units and subunits, their optimum dispersal, 
timely development of a set of protective measures, prompt 
removal of troops away from presumed massive enemy strikes, and 
execution of a decisive fire-evasion maneuver. To this end the 
combined arms commander determines probable axes of enemy air 
raids, lines from which fire support helicopter attacks are 
possible, and favorable locations for air defense weapon firing 
positions to repel surprise enemy air operations. 
  We will note that tactics of conducting combat operations by 
the roving ambush method have seen wide use lately in air 
defense troops in repelling enemy air strikes. That method of 
employing air defense weapons is practiced especially often in 
the battle to hold the security area. Use of fire ambushes 
enables, first of all, intercepting enemy aircraft and 
helicopters on approaches to the defense; and secondly, tying in 
operations of air defense weapons more closely with operations 
of forward detachments. Based on exercise experience, the 
following were methods of interworking of roving ambushes. 
Several SAM and AAA subunits usually were assigned to combat 
enemy aircraft in each grouping of air defense troops and were 
disposed throughout the depth of the security area. Their 
mission was to deliver surprise attacks periodically against 
airborne targets entering their zone of fire and to cover 
defending subunits. Immediately after firing, the air defense 
subunit would covertly displace to other positions chosen in 
advance and which had had engineer preparation. Constant subunit 
maneuvering in combination with the presence of dummy positions 
and simulation of activity reduced the effectiveness of enemy 
reconnaissance, thereby misleading him. 
  Coordinating the efforts of aviation and combat arms to 
inflict damage on the enemy on distant approaches to the defense 
presents a special complication for commanders and staffs of 
defending troops in organizing interworking. The effectiveness 
of interworking in performing this mission is determined by the 
ability to forecast the nature of an attacker's operations when 
moving from forming-up places up to the final coordination line, 
and determining the targets against which strikes should be 
delivered and what personnel and equipment must be used for 
this. The priority of targets should be established in this case 
based on the following sequence. Above all it is necessary to 
try to reduce the enemy's nuclear and fire-delivery potential by 
destroying means of nuclear attack and combat complexes of 
precision weapons, disrupting the system for command and control 
of weapons and troops, and destroying airmobile forces and army 
aviation. With personnel and equipment available, the mission is 
assigned to disrupt the enemy's forward movement and organized 
assault. 
  Delivery of nuclear and fire strikes against a 
forward-moving 
enemy grouping is tied in by time and place with remote mining 
of terrain, so the obstacles and destruction being created cause 
troops to concentrate and thereby help increase enemy losses. As 
the attacker's offensive grouping approaches the FEBA, it is 
important to try to ensure that the intensity of the fire effect 
grows continuously, initially by bringing in army aviation and 
long-range artillery and then by massing close-combat weapons, 
including by maneuvering them from other axes. 
  More and more importance is now attached to operations by 
covering troops in the fight for the tactical defensive zone. 
The defender's mission is to do everything necessary to turn the 
security area into a forward defensive zone. Some forward 
detachments unquestionably are incapable of achieving this goal. 
In order for them to be able to delay the forward movement of 
enemy units and inflict losses on them, it is necessary to 
support their operations by air strikes and artillery fire and 
to make wide use of various obstacles. 
  Wresting the fire initiative from the enemy is one of the 
defenders' difficult tasks. It is possible to achieve this if 
all weapons of the defense are used in coordination under a 
single plan and a single leadership. It is especially important 
to ensure immediate destruction of fast-acting enemy precision 
weapons and attack assets immediately after they are detected. 
The selection of weapons and methods of their actions depends on 
the target type and characteristics, its protection, and 
conditions of mission performance. 
  As shown by the experience of Operation Desert Storm, base 
airfields, missile launch positions, ground command and control 
facilities and operational-tactical missile launchers have high 
survivability even with the effect of precision weapon systems 
against them. Combating enemy reconnaissance-strike complexes 
possessing high accuracy, high reconnaissance reliability, high 
speed, high accuracy of dispensing homing-head-equipped 
submunitions against targets, and long range presents special 
difficulty. 
  Combating reconnaissance-strike complexes represents a 
combination of interrelated measures of reconnaissance and their 
swift destruction. It is conducted by all available means to 
prevent or hamper the complexes from affecting friendly troops 
and to win fire superiority over the enemy. In organizing combat 
against reconnaissance-strike complexes, it is important to take 
their vulnerable aspects into account: Their electronic 
equipment's susceptibility to the effect of electronic jamming; 
difficulty for radar reconnaissance assets to recognize real 
ground targets; possibility of diverting homing munitions 
(missiles) to false targets and decoys; and decreased 
capabilities for detecting ground targets and decreased accuracy 
of guiding munitions (missiles) to them when the enemy takes 
maskirovka measures. 
  Efforts by personnel and assets in organizing combat against 
enemy reconnaissance-strike complexes are coordinated to ensure 
their prompt detection and destruction. Main efforts are 
concentrated here on destroying ground command and control 
centers; reconnaissance and vectoring (relay) aircraft as well 
as strike aircraft in the air and on airfields; missile 
launchers at launch positions, when changing positions and in 
concentration areas; and guided aerial bombs and air-to-surface 
guided missiles. Prompt detection and preemptive destruction of 
enemy reconnaissance-strike complexes are achieved by collecting 
necessary intelligence and communicating it to commanders and 
staffs in a short time, by making substantiated decisions for 
their destruction, by rapidly assigning missions to troops, and 
by organizing precise interworking and command and control of 
forces and assets in the process of their destruction. 
  In coordinating combat efforts of assets being used to 
combat 
reconnaissance-strike complexes, it is important to achieve 
their comprehensive employment by inflicting fire damage on the 
reconnaissance-strike complexes simultaneously with electronic 
suppression of their control systems and also with the capture 
and destruction or disabling of their ground elements by 
motorized rifle, tank, airborne, air-assault and reconnaissance 
subunits. A necessary condition for effective combat against 
reconnaissance-strike complexes is continuous weapon effect on 
them. This requires constantly conducting effective 
reconnaissance and inflicting damage on their elements on the 
ground and in the air under all situation conditions in the 
course of the entire battle, taking advantage of the maximum 
reach of existing weapons. 
  Staff duties in preparing data for the commander for 
organizing interworking to combat enemy reconnaissance-strike 
complexes include the following: Ascertaining what procedure the 
senior commander has established for engaging 
reconnaissance-strike complexes, what personnel and equipment 
are being assigned for this, and what requires final 
reconnaissance in the enemy grouping and by what time; 
calculating the detail of personnel and assets necessary for 
combating reconnaissance-strike complexes; outlining the 
procedure for coordinating efforts of aircraft, artillery, and 
air defense and EW assets in performing that mission; 
determining possible missions and procedure of operations of 
airborne assault forces and of raiding, enveloping, 
reconnaissance and air assault detachments for capture or 
destruction of ground elements of the reconnaissance-strike 
complexes; and also determining who supports their operations 
when and how, and the signals for mutual recognition and target 
designation. 
  In organizing interworking of personnel and assets assigned 
for combating reconnaissance-strike complexes, the formation 
commander clarifies the following: Capabilities of aviation for 
reconnoitering and engaging them, sorties allocated for this, 
and time and methods for delivering strikes; missions assigned 
to artillery for destroying ground elements of 
reconnaissance-strike complexes, the makeup of personnel and 
assets used for this, and the procedure for them to perform the 
assigned mission; procedure for using air defense personnel and 
assets for destroying airborne elements of reconnaissance-strike 
complexes, methods of their operations, and procedure for 
interworking with aircraft; and capabilities of EW personnel and 
assets to suppress electronic targets of enemy 
reconnaissance-strike complexes and the procedure for their 
interworking with other personnel and assets assigned to combat 
those complexes. 
  Interworking is organized with special thoroughness in the 
fight to hold the main defensive zone. Stability and 
aggressiveness of the defense are ensured by a number of 
factors, above all by use of methods of aligning the defense, 
use of troop groupings, and their conduct of defensive 
operations appropriate to the situation. In one instance this 
will be achieved by firmly holding occupied lines in combination 
with counterattacks by troops from the depth, in another case by 
using mobile methods of warfare, and in a third case by their 
combination. 
  Coordinated operations of motorized rifle and tank units and 
subunits with artillery and with air defense and engineer units 
and subunits and aviation are of decisive importance both in a 
positional and a mobile defense. The principal objective of the 
interworking troops is to nullify the enemy's quantitative and 
qualitative superiority, impose one's will on the enemy by 
aggressive operations and use of new, nonstandard procedures, 
and wear down and exhaust his offensive grouping. Efforts of 
defending troops must be built up at a preemptive rate so it is 
possible to promptly close breaches that have formed by means of 
a fire concentration; by forward movement of antitank reserves, 
mobile obstacle detachments, and subunits removed from secondary 
axes; and also by remote mining of the terrain. 
  Combat helicopters play an important role in timely 
concentration of fire efforts on threatened axes. In organizing 
interworking with them it is necessary to make full use of their 
advantages such as the absence of a need for specially prepared 
landing sites, the capability for conducting combat operations 
regardless of terrain relief and presence of obstacles, 
capability for swift maneuver, high accuracy (probability of 
killing the target with the first launch of missiles), use of 
the factor of surprise, sudden appearance from behind cover when 
in a hover mode, capability for multipurpose use, employment of 
main weapons whose radius of action exceeds the range of the 
majority of tactical air defense systems, and the capability of 
combat employment with very low cloud cover. 
  But employment of helicopters also has substantial 
shortcomings: Lengthy time in a hover mode and the resultant 
high probability of the helicopter being killed by various kinds 
of weapons; the action of many guided missile systems from a 
distance no closer than 400-500 m; total or partial 
unsuitability of helicopters for all-weather use; practical 
impossibility even of a temporary seizure of terrain sectors by 
a helicopter subunit; limited conditions of visibility (absence 
of all-around view); and weapon effectiveness only in the 
absence of jamming. 
  The experience of local wars shows that so-called helicopter 
"roving elements" operating with motorized infantry and tank 
subunits are very effective in performing such missions as 
closing breaches, securing flanks, covering gaps and combating 
enemy raiding and enveloping detachments. Apache, Lynx-3 and 
Gazelle fire support helicopters and Black Hawk, Iroquois and 
Lynx AH-1 multipurpose helicopters with motorized infantry and 
combat engineer subunits aboard usually are included as part of 
such elements. For continuous fire effect on the enemy for the 
entire period of combat operations it is envisaged employing the 
"one-third" principle: One subunit attacks the enemy; a second 
is en route to deliver a fire strike or is en route after its 
execution; and the third is at a forward ammunition resupply and 
refueling point. 
  In examining the problem of interworking in modern defensive 
battle, it is impossible to ignore the circumstance that, in 
contrast to the past, one now has to coordinate efforts of 
defending troops in such a way as to have an opportunity to 
successfully combat enemy units and subunits which have been 
landed or have penetrated to the rear of friendly troops while 
simultaneously repelling an enemy frontal assault. To this end 
appropriate measures are envisaged, first of all, for detecting 
a landing of enemy airborne assault forces and raiding and 
reconnaissance units and a penetration into the rear of 
defending troops by his raiding, forward and enveloping 
detachments; and secondly, for disrupting their performance of 
missions and destroying them. 
  During the Great Patriotic War the enemy usually was fought 
in the depth of the friendly troop disposition by the 
territorial principle, i.e., commanders of combined arms units 
and chiefs of rear facilities were given responsibility for 
destroying enemy airborne assault forces and subunits which had 
penetrated their assigned areas of responsibility, which if 
necessary were divided into sectors and the latter into sections 
combining important facilities and their defending troops within 
their boundaries. Additional subunits would be assigned if 
necessary to reinforce the defending troops for "sweeping" the 
terrain. 
  The territorial principle of combating the enemy in the rear 
of friendly troops in the defense retains its importance even 
under present conditions. This obligates units and subunits to 
be ready to destroy enemy airborne assault forces and other 
units regardless of their place in the combat formation. But in 
addition, performing this mission also requires the assignment 
of special antilanding reserves, reinforcing them with 
artillery, combat helicopters and engineer subunits. In 
coordinating efforts of antilanding forces, it is important to 
tie their actions in with airborne and ground surveillance 
posts, various patrols, traffic control posts and air defense 
weapons in order to detect the appearance of enemy units 
promptly, warn friendly troops of this and take steps to destroy 
them without delay. 
  Organizing interworking presents the greatest difficulty in 
the dynamics of defensive battle when combat efforts of 
defending troops are to be transferred from one position or line 
to another, i.e., with transition from a positional to a mobile 
defense. The uniqueness of conditions in this case consists of 
the extraordinary dynamic nature and intensity of the situation. 
Having the initiative, the enemy can make wide use of close and 
deep envelopments to cut off and encircle withdrawing subunits, 
land airborne assault forces in their rear, and make deep 
penetrations to preempt defending troops in moving to favorable 
lines in the depth. 
  In coordinating efforts of units and subunits under these 
conditions, it is important to ensure that the main body breaks 
contact with the attacker; and to tie him up for a certain time 
with battles in the space between positions by means of 
aggressive actions of covering subunits, skilled use of mobile 
antitank subunits and helicopter and ground ambushes, and the 
conduct of surprise counterattacks even with forces of small 
subunits, as well as by emplacing obstacles primarily by remote 
minelaying equipment. Strikes by missile troops and aircraft, 
and artillery fire from indirect firing positions are organized 
so as to ensure engagement of the enemy from maximum ranges, 
prevent his approach, deployment and preparation for an assault, 
counter deep and close envelopments, and, most important, win 
time and achieve a timely maneuver of withdrawing subunits to 
occupy a favorable line in the depth. 
  The art of organizing interworking in conducting a mobile 
defense lies in inflicting damage with limited personnel and 
equipment on an enemy who is many times superior in personnel 
and equipment; winning time; placing enemy troops in difficult 
conditions, hampering their maneuver and at the same time 
conserving one's own forces; being able to move troops out from 
under an enemy attack in time; drawing the attacker into fire 
pockets or under attack from ambushes; and misleading him 
regarding one's true intentions by deception procedures. 
<H3>  3. Principle of Interworking in Offensive Battle and the 
Meeting Engagement </H3>
  The procedure developed in the Great Patriotic War for 
coordinating combat efforts of troops in the offensive retains 
its significance even under present conditions. The 1989 
"Boyevoy ustav Sukhoputnykh voysk" [Ground Troops Field Manual] 
states that interworking should be organized by missions, lines, 
time and methods of mission execution.[.sup]38[/] With 
respect to the content of interworking, procedures for its 
organization, and work methods of command and control entities, 
much has changed here compared with the past both in the defense 
as well as in the offensive battle and meeting engagement under 
the influence of new factors of warfare which appeared in 
postwar times. 
  The sequence of developing questions of interworking in 
combined arms battle is shown in Fig. 13. 



<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-003LC-71A>             Fig. 13. Sequence of developing questions ofFigure 1. Artillery Battalion </FIG>



  In analyzing the system of troop interworking established in 
the past war, it is easy to note that a certain method was 
inherent to it. This reflected the planned nature of conducting 
the offensive. It would begin during breakthrough of the enemy 
defense with artillery and air preparation of the assault, and 
included the successive taking of the first, second and 
subsequent defensive positions. Troop combat efforts would build 
up during the battle for them. Then the troops would exploit the 
success achieved and shift to the pursuit under favorable 
conditions (Fig. 14). Thus, troop combat efforts would be 
coordinated for these and similar individual missions. 




    Now the attacker strives to deliver deep strikes at the very 
beginning of battle, take in the entire enemy tactical defensive 
zone with aggressive combat operations, immobilize all elements 
of his combat alignment, transfer combat efforts into the depth 
as quickly as possible, and establish a constantly operating 
front in the enemy rear by landing the air echelon there and by 
the swift penetration of forward units and of raiding and 
enveloping detachments. It is understandable that this method of 
the offensive predetermines methods of coordinating combat 
efforts of elements of the combat formation of combat arms units 
differently than before, inasmuch as they have to operate 
dispersed across a broad front and to a great depth in 
performing diverse missions. 
  A flexible "multiechelon" system of interworking should 
correspond to that character of the land-air battle. In 
organizing it, commanders and staffs must take into account the 
possibility of the sides' deep mutual penetrations, conduct of 
battle with an "inverted" front, and a rapid, abrupt transition 
from one kind of combat operations to another, which 
predetermines continuous correction of the battle plan and the 
system of interworking. 
  Under those conditions commanders and staff officers should 
display profound tactical prudence, anticipate how combat events 
might develop, what resistance the enemy will offer in the 
battle for a particular objective, and what new combat 
procedures and kinds of weapons he may employ; accordingly, they 
should determine how to use the attack and maneuver capabilities 
of friendly combat arms more effectively and how to tie their 
actions in with each other so it is possible to make up for weak 
aspects of one kind of weapon with strong aspects of others. 
  In view of the fact that frequent "interruptions" in the 
system of interworking are possible in the course of battle 
either due to enemy effect on advancing troops or due to 
subordinates' imprecise actions and inability to organize, it is 
important to react to situation changes exceptionally swiftly, 
take prompt measures preventing disruption of the prescribed 
procedure for coordinated actions, update missions for subunits, 
and correctly determine the primary importance of a particular 
combat arm in achieving success so as to involve all other 
forces and assets in support of its operations. 
  It is impossible to ignore the fact that many 
military-theoretical works give the recommendation that 
interworking in the offensive should be organized in greatest 
detail to the depth of performance of the immediate 
mission.[.sup]39[/] It would appear that this approach to 
coordinating efforts does not fully reflect the altered 
conditions of modern battle, which has become deep and vast, in 
connection with which it is difficult to factor out where the 
primary mission is being accomplished. While in the past, when 
the capture of enemy defensive positions was the basis of 
attacking troops' combat missions and the range of the bulk of 
division and regimental weapons was relatively short, the 
provisions indicated above for planning battle in detail only to 
a shallow depth were fully justified. Now the situation has 
changed. 
  The grouping of enemy weapons has become the basis of the 
defense, which largely predetermines its stability. It is 
impossible to disrupt the defensive system without having 
destroyed this grouping. But for this it is necessary to deliver 
strikes both against his close-range as well as long-range 
weapons simultaneously. Consequently, in preparing the offensive 
it is advisable to plan interworking in all details essentially 
to the full depth of the combat mission. This will enable 
interworking commanders and staffs to correctly calculate their 
personnel and equipment and distribute the available resource of 
ammunition, fuels and lubricants and other supplies for the 
entire period of battle. 
  Many new requirements for organization of reconnaissance of 
the enemy defense, discovery of his deep targets, a larger-scale 
situation estimate, thorough performance of operational-tactical 
calculations and simulation of combat operations stem from what 
has been said. Inasmuch as the system of defense alignment now 
largely has changed and main troop efforts are concentrated on 
holding not so much positions as vital areas (which is where the 
main weapons as well as follow-on forces are concentrated), it 
is necessary to coordinate the operations of attacking units and 
subunits not only by lines and objectives, but also by the most 
important areas whose capture will ensure undermining of the 
stability of the entire defensive system of an enemy formation 
or unit. 
  Major changes in the nature of modern battle dictated by 
employment of new weapons demand determining the sequence of 
coordinating troop combat efforts by individual missions 
differently than before. Thus, previously organization of 
interworking would begin with the tying in of operations in the 
period of artillery and air preparation of the assault. 
Preparatory measures preceding this were left outside the 
framework of the interworking process. This was explained by the 
fact that the offensive against a deliberate enemy defense was 
carried out as a rule from a position occupied in immediate 
contact with the enemy, and only in rare cases did the latter 
have an opportunity to strike an offensive troop grouping poised 
for an assault by conducting artillery and air 
counterpreparation and thereby disrupting the assault. 
  Now the danger of an offensive being disrupted has increased 
considerably and this circumstance is impossible to ignore, 
especially as troops may launch an offensive not only from a 
position of defense, but also often while moving forward from 
forming-up places occupied in the depth or from the march. But 
it is common knowledge that troop vulnerability to enemy 
precision weapons is especially high during forward movement, as 
they are not under cover. And in an offensive, the danger of 
troops being hit if the defender delivers fire strikes also 
increases, especially at the moment they launch an assault. 
  With consideration of this, it appears advisable to take 
measures aimed at preventing the enemy from disrupting an 
offensive. This task is very difficult and many-sided. Its 
accomplishment presumes coordination of efforts of all 
interworking personnel and equipment so as to ensure effective 
fire and electronic countermeasures to enemy weapons, reliable 
fire cover from the ground and from the air for troops moving 
forward, their swift negotiation of obstacles created by enemy 
remote minelaying equipment, and combat against enemy airborne 
assault forces, tactical airmobile detachments and raiding and 
reconnaissance units being landed on routes of forward movement 
and in the rear of attacking troops. It is important to ensure 
high survivability and protection of subunits against strikes by 
the defender's precision weapon systems and rapid restoration of 
troop combat effectiveness in case they are subjected to enemy 
nuclear and fire strikes. 
  In coordinating actions of units and subunits in the process 
of forward movement, deployment and launching an assault, it is 
necessary to take into account the range and effectiveness of 
enemy weapons which may bring pressure on forward-moving units. 
Timely engagement of those weapons whose impact zone they 
successively enter as they approach the FEBA should be envisaged 
for this. Above all it is necessary to destroy ground and 
airborne elements of reconnaissance-strike complexes, missile 
launchers, MLRS, combat helicopters on pads, field artillery 
employing guided munitions, ATGM systems and other antitank 
weapons, especially armored targets. Simultaneously, one should 
coordinate efforts of missile troops and artillery with aviation 
for engaging personnel and weapons in company or platoon 
strongpoints during fire preparation and then also during fire 
support of an assault by motorized rifle and tank subunits. 
  In coordinating efforts of troops moving forward for 
combating enemy airborne assault forces, their possible landing 
areas are determined, necessary antilanding forces are assigned, 
and helicopter ambushes are arranged whose operations are tied 
in with air strikes and artillery fire and also with actions of 
forward-moving motorized rifle and tank subunits. In determining 
the procedure for negotiating mass obstacles created by the 
enemy in the period of the troops' forward movement, it is 
necessary to take into account when and by what method he may 
emplace them. Surprise "straddling" of subunits' combat or march 
formation by remote minelaying equipment presents special danger. 
  It must be borne in mind that all remotely laid mines have 
safety devices preventing premature initiation. Many are armed 
5-8 minutes after falling to the ground. With the presence of 
such devices confirmed and the type of mines determined, the 
best method of troop actions is their immediate departure from 
the mined area without clearing lanes; but a halt can be made if 
the opportunity presents itself. Being in a mined area even for 
a short time (2-4 hours) may reduce losses from exploding mines, 
since after a certain time the mines' self-destruction 
(neutralization) elements are triggered. In the course of 
forward movement one should expect minelaying by the "straddle" 
method in route sectors where going around them is difficult (in 
chokepoints, in defiles, on crossings). In this case organizing 
duties of observation and warning of mine danger assumes special 
importance. 
  In coordinating troop combat efforts to counter enemy 
weapons 
which may disrupt or hamper the operations of attacking 
subunits, it is necessary on the one hand to take steps to 
promptly detect enemy fire control facilities, aircraft 
vectoring posts, ground and airborne elements of 
reconnaissance-strike and reconnaissance-fire complexes, 
position areas of missile troops, artillery firing positions and 
helicopter landing sites; and on the other hand to ensure the 
readiness and capability of friendly weapons for immediate, 
effective pressure on the above. 
  Along with active methods of troop operations aimed at 
preventing enemy disruption of an offensive, in organizing 
interworking one also cannot lose sight of the need for carrying 
out such measures as ensuring covertness of the offensive and 
survivability of subunits. To this end, in choosing routes of 
forward movement make maximum use of the terrain's protective 
and concealing features. Optical and radar dead ground formed by 
relief and local features can be used for protecting equipment 
moving along prepared routes against enemy precision weapon 
systems, while heat-emitting and radar decoys are set up along 
routes in sectors capable of being observed. Meanwhile, it is 
advisable to prepare dummy routes, and radar reflectors should 
be set up in their open sectors. 
  Efforts of interworking personnel and equipment should be 
coordinated with special thoroughness to achieve an organized, 
resolute assault of the enemy FEBA. This is the culmination of 
battle. The defender will strive to commit the maximum of 
close-range and long-range weapons to bring pressure on 
assaulting subunits. One can judge the intensity of his fire at 
this moment from the fact that just with organic weapons a 
defending motorized infantry battalion can use more than 300 
weapons of various kinds for repulsing an assault, including 
over 100 long-range antitank weapons capable of hitting armored 
targets beginning from ranges of 3,000-4,000 m. 
  Hence the need arises to coordinate employment of friendly 
weapons so as to subject weapons situated not only on the enemy 
FEBA, but also in the depth to simultaneous pressure. But this 
requires reconnoitering the defensive system and having precise 
knowledge of the location of each dug-in tank, gun and IFV as 
well as ATGM. To ensure a successful assault it is necessary to 
destroy at least 70-80 percent of antitank weapons right during 
fire preparation. 
  The procedure for engaging enemy targets at his first 
defensive position and in the depth may be as follows. Armored 
antitank weapons situated immediately in front of assaulting 
subunits and on flanks of the penetration sector are destroyed 
by the fire of artillery pieces, ATGM systems and combat 
helicopters. At the same time, aircraft and MLRS strikes are 
delivered against the following situated in the defensive depth: 
Enemy tanks and antitank subunits (with ATGM systems on an 
armored base), MLRS batteries, and antitank helicopter subunits 
at their bases. Combat helicopters play an important role in 
destroying armored targets and other targets in the enemy 
defense during an assault. In organizing interworking with them, 
the combined arms commander indicates when and against which 
targets to deliver a strike; the procedure for mutual 
recognition of friendly subunits; and target designation 
signals. Helicopter subunits can deliver simultaneous strikes at 
full strength or with the bulk of forces against preassigned 
targets at a designated time, or successive strikes against 
targets newly detected in the course of an assault, with 
departure on call from an alert status at staging sites, from 
ambushes, or from airborne alert. With a sharply changing ground 
situation, intensive enemy electronic jamming, and with reliable 
suppression of his air defense weapons, helicopters may carry 
out an independent target search (target-of-opportunity roving). 
Here is how this was done in exercises. 
  A pair of fire support helicopters usually was assigned for 
a 
search. The distance between them in depth was 1,000-1,500 m 
with the very same altitude. On detecting a target, the 
helicopters would deliver a strike against it and if necessary 
would call in a reinforcing element and vector it to the strike 
target. Helicopters would make a target approach from a 
favorable direction which ensured covertness of the approach, 
reliable detection and recognition of the target, and a swift 
attack. Best conditions for a surprise strike were created with 
an approach to the target below the lower limit of the impact 
zone of air defense systems, which is possible when flying at an 
extremely low altitude (20-30 m) and taking advantage of folds 
of the terrain. With heavy enemy air defense, helicopters would 
engage the enemy while above friendly subunit combat formations. 
  Based on experience of combat operations in Afghanistan, 
combat helicopters would employ the following methods of attack 
-- from level flight, a dive, or a hover. 
  An attack from level flight would be made for engaging 
targets with ATGM's and free-flight rockets. Duration of the 
strike was shortened and its effectiveness was achieved when 
helicopters employed the maximum number of weapons in one pass. 
Helicopters would deliver strikes without going beyond limits of 
the disposition of friendly subunit combat formations. 
  An attack from a dive was executed for hitting targets with 
free-flight rockets, but here the range to the target did not 
exceed 1,000-1,500 m. With weak opposition from enemy air 
defense weapons, such an attack was used to hit targets situated 
in folds of the terrain, in shelters, and behind reverse 
hillslopes, i.e., when an attack from level flight proved 
impossible. 
  A helicopter attack from a hover is the most effective. In a 
hover mode the helicopter can employ all kinds of weapons 
(ATGM's, free-flight rockets) and conduct machinegun fire. The 
helicopter must change its position after each launch in a hover 
mode. 
  The experience of the Great Patriotic War and local wars 
showed that greatest difficulties in maintaining interworking 
are created during battle in the depth of the enemy defense, 
which is characterized by unpredictability of the development of 
events and the frequent appearance of crisis situations. Far 
from everything can be anticipated in advance in operations of 
combat formation elements and combat arms before the beginning 
of an offensive. Therefore one must be ready for the fact that 
in the course of battle it will be necessary to substantially 
correct or even create the system of interworking anew more than 
once. 
  It can be expected that as attacking troops wedge into the 
defense, the enemy will step up resistance and do everything 
possible to localize the penetration. Therefore in the course of 
battle there will be a stubborn contest of the sides in building 
up combat efforts. Under such conditions, preempting the enemy 
in maneuvering and in delivering fire strikes and disrupting his 
plan are of great importance. It is important not to give him an 
opportunity to restore a disrupted fire and obstacle plan or to 
carry out a planned redeployment of personnel and assets 
laterally and out of the depth. Successful performance of these 
and other missions by the attacking troops largely depends on 
coordination of their operations by objective, place and time. 
  It is especially important to achieve precision and 
cohesiveness of troop operations in building up combat efforts 
on a decisive axis, i.e., where success has appeared. 
  Above all a commander must decide on the method by which he 
should strive to continuously maintain decisive superiority over 
the enemy on the main axis. It is common knowledge that in World 
War II essentially the only method of building up efforts was to 
commit second echelons or reserves. Now the prevailing place is 
held by fire strikes of reconnaissance-strike and 
reconnaissance-fire complexes, missile troops, and aviation and 
by artillery fire. The advantage of this method lies in 
swiftness of execution. 
  In addition, at the present time there has been a 
considerable expansion in troop capabilities for building up 
efforts by employing airborne assault forces and airmobile 
subunits. Landed in the depth of the enemy defense right after 
fire strikes, they are capable of quickly exploiting their 
results, capturing tactically important areas (road junctions, 
commanding heights, passes, built-up areas, crossings over water 
obstacles) and thereby preventing the approach of enemy reserves 
and contributing to exploitation of the success of first echelon 
units. 
  At crisis moments of battle, when there is the threat that 
the offensive will "lose steam" or even be disrupted, the 
commander will have to use all forces and assets at his disposal 
to retain the initiative, i.e., he must build up efforts both by 
a maneuver of fire as well as by commitment of the second 
echelon or reserve, and if possible also by landing an assault 
force in the enemy rear. It is necessary to achieve coordinated 
delivery of strikes against the defense simultaneously from the 
ground and air and from the front, flanks and rear in order to 
dissipate the enemy's attention and efforts. 
  This is a difficult task. By the time the second echelon is 
committed, the situation often can become critical as a result 
of the enemy's delivery of a surprise, stunning strike. It is 
not precluded that command and control will be disrupted and 
that some units and subunits will lose combat effectiveness. 
Under those conditions steps are taken above all to determine 
the true status of troops and restore disrupted command and 
control. The combat mission is updated for the commander of the 
subunit being committed and he is also told the point of 
commitment to battle, routes and time for moving to it, and 
procedure for fire support and interworking with first echelon 
subunits. If an airborne assault force is landed in the enemy 
rear and the dispatch of a raiding detachment is planned 
simultaneously with commitment of the second echelon, then their 
operations are coordinated by objective, place and time. 
  Under favorable conditions it is advisable to create smoke 
screens to ensure concealment of the second echelon's 
commitment. The procedure for employing smokes can vary. 
Blinding smoke screens in support of assaulting motorized rifle 
and tank subunits usually are laid down by artillery in terrain 
sectors easily viewed from the enemy's side at the point of 
commitment to battle. Blinding of the defender's antitank 
weapons and tanks by artillery smoke projectiles should begin 
3-5 minutes before the end of a fire assault and end with the 
arrival of assaulting subunits at the final coordination line. 
  Concealing smoke screens can be emplaced in the course of 
battle by the assaulting subunits themselves to hamper 
operations of enemy antitank helicopters and also to conceal a 
maneuver. Smoke generation begins with the subunits' arrival in 
the impact zone of enemy ATGM's or at the final coordination 
line. When the subunits approach the smoke screening line, smoke 
generation ceases and the assault is carried out. The experience 
of local wars shows that the effectiveness of employing enemy 
antitank weapons is reduced by 3-5 times with skillful use of 
concealing smoke screens and by 10-15 times when using blinding 
screens. It is advisable to use smoke assets suddenly across a 
broad front with consideration of terrain and weather conditions. 
  In conducting battle in the depth of the enemy defense, 
motorized rifle and tank units should interwork with aviation 
with special precision. The fact is that in a number of cases 
because of a lag, artillery will be the only means of troop 
support. Coordination of air and ground strikes on the 
battlefield is manifested in distributing targets between 
artillery and aviation, in establishing the priority of attacks 
between aircraft and helicopters, and in designating lines of 
responsibility. Safety measures are strictly observed. 
  In coordinating combat efforts of motorized rifle and tank 
units and artillery with aviation, the principle implemented is 
that aviation attacks those targets whose destruction by ground 
troops' weapons is hampered or impossible. Ground and air 
strikes are tied in by time and lines. Efforts of artillery, 
combat helicopters and aircraft are separated by time and lines. 
During the day the line of permissible air attack comes closer 
to the FEBA and at night it pulls back. Aircraft and helicopter 
flights are staggered in altitude and they are assigned routes 
by a joint air traffic control center. Fire support of front 
aviation, combat helicopters and artillery is directed according 
to a schedule compiled and coordinated in detail. 
  Experience gained in local wars and tactical exercises 
permits drawing certain conclusions with respect to 
characteristic shortcomings allowed by combined arms commanders 
in organizing and accomplishing interworking with aviation. 
Above all there often is a tendency to dissipate air efforts to 
combat numerous small targets instead of concentrating strikes 
against the most important objectives. Sometimes the role of 
long-range artillery is imposed on combat aircraft, i.e., they 
are assigned missions for engaging targets situated at a shallow 
depth. The principle of economy of allocated air sorties is not 
always adhered to; they are quickly used up when units perform 
the immediate mission and no sorties remain for supporting 
subsequent operations. It also often happens that, having called 
in aircraft to deliver a strike against one target, the combined 
arms commander changes their mission and strike targets when 
aircraft appear over the battlefield, as a result of which 
neither mission is executed. A shortcoming such as poor 
intelligence support to aviation also is typical. The air 
command element often is forced to conduct reconnaissance "for 
itself" and to concern itself with vectoring aircraft to 
designated targets and about their markings. 
  In conclusion, we will dwell on certain features of 
interworking in a meeting engagement. Above all we will note 
that usually it is organized under conditions of extremely 
limited time during the march, which requires high efficiency 
and cohesiveness in work of commanders and staffs and swiftness 
and precision of troop operations. General principles for 
organizing interworking are the very same as in the offensive. 
The distinction is that missions for units and subunits and the 
system of interworking must be updated more often. Special 
attention in coordinating troop combat efforts is given to 
preempting the enemy in deploying, opening fire and executing a 
maneuver. 
<H5>  Conclusions and Recommendations </H5>
  1. The principle of interworking is one of the fundamental 
principles of combined arms battle. It indicates that to achieve 
the assigned goal--to defeat the enemy--it is necessary to 
ensure precise operations of all personnel and assets 
participating in the battle, strictly coordinated by missions, 
axes, lines, time and methods of conducting battle. 
  2. Organization and accomplishment of interworking is a 
complex, many-sided, creative process of the commander and staff 
officers which requires them to have profound foresight of the 
development of events and the ability to effectively use fire, 
attack and maneuver capabilities of units and subunits of combat 
arms and special troops under various situation conditions, to 
closely tie their actions in with each other, and to make up for 
weak aspects and shortcomings of some with the strong aspects 
and advantages of other combat arms and special troops in order 
to successfully perform the combat mission by joint, coordinated 
efforts. 
  3. Fundamentals of interworking are laid down in the 
commander's decision, but interworking does not duplicate the 
decision; it develops and supplements it. While the important 
thing in the decision is to determine the objective of battle 
and methods of achieving it, the most important thing in 
organizing interworking is determine specific ways of fulfilling 
assigned missions with consideration of possible situation 
changes, different options of operations by friendly and enemy 
troops, and the appearance of crisis situations. 
  4. Although fundamentals of interworking in battle which 
were 
developed in the Great Patriotic War retain their significance 
even now, continuous renewal of the material base of modern 
battle requires searching for new ways of realizing this 
principle with consideration of demands of deep, air-ground, 
electronic battle characterized by an ever growing spatial 
scope, dynamic nature, high decisiveness and mobility. 
  5. To master proficiency in organizing interworking, 
officers 
are required to continuously deepen their knowledge in studying 
the nature and character of modern combined arms battle, combat 
capabilities of weapons and combat equipment, and methods of 
their employment in battle; develop tactical prudence and skills 
in performing operational-tactical calculations and modeling 
combat operations; and be able to quickly collect situation data 
and restore a disrupted system of communications and system of 
interworking.

  This instructional aid presents practical recommendations 
for 
employment of the artillery battalion in the combined-arms 
battle and shows the work of the commander and staff in 
organizing and planning combat operations and in command and 
control of the battalion in various types of battle. The second 
edition has been revised and supplemented with materials on 
combat, logistic, and technical support, and also with the 
peculiarities of employing self-propelled artillery. 
  It is intended for officers of the Ground Forces and 
military 
school cadets. 
<H5>  From the Authors </H5>
  The purpose of the second edition of this book is to help 
commanders of artillery subunits to expand their tactical 
outlook and to help study more deeply the fundamentals of combat 
employment of the artillery battalion and the work of the 
commander and staff of the battalion to prepare and conduct the 
battalion's combat operations. The book can serve as an aid in 
organizing tactical drills, short exercises, and practices in 
fire control. 
  The basic provisions for organizing and planning combat 
operations by the battalion commander and staff, command and 
control of the battalion, the fundamentals of combat employment, 
and the combat operations of the battalion in various types of 
combat and on the march are examined in accordance with the 
regulation documents in effect and taking into account the 
experience of the Great Patriotic War and the data of troop 
exercises of recent years. 
  The tactical examples show the practical work of the 
battalion commander and staff in organizing the battalion 
operations for offensive, defensive, and march preparation 
conditions. Examples are presented of documents worked up in the 
battalion and orders of the commander (chief of staff) for 
comprehensive support of combat operations and preparation for 
firing. It also shows the actions of the battalion under various 
conditions and the command and control of the battalion. 
  The nature of the battalion combat operations examined in 
various types of combat and partially in special conditions is 
supported by examples from the experience of the Great Patriotic 
War and tactical exercises. The book takes into account the 
changes in the outfitting of artillery subunits with weapons and 
combat equipment. 
  In comparison with the first edition, in this edition the 
tactical examples have been substantially revised; more 
attention is given to organizing cooperation; a tactical example 
is given on organizing the march; employment of self-propelled 
artillery is more widely shown; and a number of new sections 
have been introduced. 
  We hope that this book, addressed primarily to artillery 
officers at the battery-battalion level and to commanders of 
combined-arms subunits cooperating with artillery subunits, will 
also be useful to instructors and cadets of artillery schools 
and to reserve officers. 
  We express gratitude to Lt-Gen V.M. Zakharov, Lt-Gen A.P. 
Lebedev, Lt-Gen Yu.I. Shumilikhin, Col E.G. Bazylev, and other 
comrades for the valuable advice and suggestions expressed on 
the content of the book. 
<H5>  Chapter 1. Fundamentals of Combat Employment of the Battalion </H5>
<H5>  The Role of Artillery Subunits in Modern Combined-Arms Battle </H5>
  Modern battle is combined-arms battle, for it is waged by 
the 
combined efforts of all troops participating in it with the use 
of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles (armored personnel 
carriers), artillery, air defense assets, airplanes, 
helicopters, and other combat equipment and armament. All 
subunits and units participating in the battle operate under a 
single concept, directing their efforts at achieving the rapid 
defeat of the enemy. In battle, they employ techniques and 
methods of battle inherent only to them, stemming from the 
particular features of their organization, and the combat 
performance characteristics and capabilities of the available 
armament. 
  Constant improvement of the characteristics of conventional 
weapons leads to improvement in their accuracy and speed, and an 
increase in their range and the explosive force of munitions. 
All this invariably leads to an increase in their combat 
capabilities. These qualitative changes and the new, mostly 
armored combat equipment in the inventory of subunits and units 
has a significant influence on changing the nature of modern 
battle. It is distinguished by decisiveness, high mobility, 
intensity, and diversity in using the methods of conducting it. 
  The decisiveness and high mobility of combat actions lead to 
rapid and abrupt situation changes, which have a significant 
influence on the course of carrying out assigned tasks and which 
force commanders to make new, often urgent decisions and to 
carry out actions according to the situation that has taken 
shape. Abrupt situation changes can be brought about by the 
rapid commitment of combined-arms reserves (second echelons), a 
surprise attack (counterattack), landing of a tactical airborne 
assault force, a surprise attack by combat helicopters, the use 
of assets for mining the terrain, the enemy's use of weapons of 
mass destruction, encirclement of the enemy, and other actions. 
  The actions of combined-arms subunits in modern 
combined-arms 
battle are diverse. They may advance on the defending enemy or 
defend, wage a meeting engagement or pursue the enemy, force 
water obstacles or operate as part of an airborne tactical 
assault force, and so forth. 
  They are capable of waging battle on various terrain 
(mountains, deserts, forests, city, and northern regions) and at 
various times of the year and day. 
  Therefore, all characteristics of battle, the peculiarities 
of the terrain, and other conditions in which modern battle may 
be waged must be taken into account by commanders of all levels 
during the course of combat training. 
  Modern battle is, above all, a firefight. The importance of 
fire and its coordination with attack and maneuver under 
conditions of increased combat capabilities of weapon assets 
take on a new quality. The use of modern models of conventional 
weapons in battle makes it possible in short periods of time to 
inflict heavy losses on the enemy and create breaches in his 
battle formation, and the high mobility of subunits and units 
makes it possible to deliver fire quickly, attack the enemy on 
the move, and swiftly advance deep into enemy lines. 
  Artillery, being the main firepower of the Ground Forces, 
plays a decisive role in effective engagement of the enemy. This 
is evidenced by the rich experience of the Great Patriotic War. 
Artillery paved the way with firepower for the offensive of our 
tanks and infantry, and on the defensive it blocked the path of 
the enemy. 
  Artillery subunits (battalion, battery), possessing powerful 
and long-range fire, support tank and motorized rifle subunits 
in all types of battle. 
  Artillery subunits destroy artillery and rocket launcher 
batteries, mortar platoons, infantry fighting vehicles, armored 
personnel carriers, antitank weapons, personnel, command and 
observation posts, and other targets. The majority of these 
targets are armored and on the battlefield will move, maneuver, 
and be located at positions (firing positions) for short periods 
of time. Therefore, it is necessary to destroy them immediately 
after they are detected. Effective destruction of them requires 
determining their coordinates with a high degree of accuracy and 
opening fire quickly and without warning. 
  Uninterrupted and very close cooperation with supported 
combined-arms subunits is the basis of the actions of all 
artillery subunits. 
  The constant threat of the enemy using nuclear, chemical, 
and 
bacteriological (biological) weapons requires commanders of all 
levels to continuously discover and immediately destroy them by 
all available means, fully accomplish measures to protect 
against weapons of mass destruction, and be able to wage battle 
under conditions of the enemy's use of these types of weapons. 
  Special attention in modern battle should be given to the 
timely relocation (maneuver) of artillery subunits and the 
ability to deploy them rapidly on the move (from the line of 
march) and to carry out fire missions on terrain that is 
inconvenient tactically, at unprepared firing positions, and 
under enemy artillery fire and air strikes. The use of 
self-propelled artillery is most advantageous in these 
conditions. 
  In order successfully to control an artillery subunit and 
its 
fire in the complex conditions of modern battle, commanders and 
their staffs must correctly use all the available assets at 
their disposal, make competent decisions in compressed time 
periods, predict the course of development of battle, 
persistently strive to implement the decisions, and demonstrate 
initiative. 
  Every commander must demonstrate creativity in battle, that 
is, he must look for and skillfully apply new techniques and 
methods, and reject stereotypical, automatic patterns, and 
dogmatism. Creativity in tactics depends on a continually 
growing theoretical arsenal, which officers must constantly 
master. Now it is inconceivable to lead subunits and teach and 
educate subordinates without scientific knowledge. 
<H5>  The Artillery Battalion: The Basic Fire and Tactical Subunit </H5>
  The appearance of nuclear weapons and the considerable 
modernization of conventional weapons caused profound changes in 
the nature of modern combined-arms battle. In these conditions, 
new demands are placed on artillery, aimed at improving weapons, 
ammunition, and instrumentation; reducing the time to carry out 
fire missions; and increasing the accuracy of calculating firing 
data. Full preparation has become the main method of determining 
firing data. Constant improvement of tactics, firing and fire 
control techniques, and also methods combat training has become 
the basis of daily training of artillery units and subunits. 
Workers of scientific institutions, instructors at military 
educational institutions, artillery staffs, and commanders of 
artillery units and subunits participate actively in carrying 
out these tasks. 
  Equipping artillery with qualitatively new models of 
self-propelled artillery systems and weapon control vehicles 
(command vehicles) was an important factor in increasing its 
combat effectiveness. With more accurate instruments for 
reconnaissance, topogeodetic survey, and command and control, 
self-propelled artillery subunits are able to open accurate fire 
in short time periods. They can best operate with tank and 
motorized rifle subunits and units in battle and accomplish 
continuous support of them. 
  Sophisticated modern combat equipment requires commanders 
and 
all personnel of subunits to maintain it in constant combat 
readiness, for which it is necessary to have a thorough 
knowledge of the working principles of the equipment, organize 
correct operation of it, and perform periodic maintenance 
(technical servicing) in a timely manner. 
  As an organizational unit of artillery, the artillery 
battalion consists of a command element, staff, several 
batteries, and combat support and maintenance subunits. 
Organizationally it is part of a unit. 
  A battalion's artillery subunits are outfitted with various 
instruments for artillery reconnaissance, fire control, 
topogeodetic survey, meteorological support, and radiation and 
chemical reconnaissance, and communications equipment. The 
subunits also have assets for self-defense and for conducting 
engineer work and camouflage, and there is an artillery 
ballistic station in the battalion. 
  Possessing powerful and accurate fire, a battalion is able 
to 
destroy various targets--ground targets, surface targets, 
targets in the open, and sheltered targets--and to provide 
continuous fire support to combined-arms subunits in battle. 
  The experience of combat employment of artillery subunits 
shows that destroying targets located at a site, such as platoon 
strong points, ATGM [antitank guided missile] launchers at 
positions, artillery batteries (particularly armored 
self-propelled batteries), and command posts located over 
considerable areas is not very effective with fire from 
individual batteries, much less platoons (guns). In addition, 
the increased degree of protection and high maneuvering 
capabilities of these targets has resulted in a need to use 
projectiles of increased power and to reduce the time of fire 
pressure against these targets. For example, it takes an average 
of up to 10 minutes for motorized infantry and tank subunits to 
escape bombardment; ATGM subunits three-four minutes; and 
self-propelled batteries five-six minutes. 
  Experience shows that the battalion fire in battle accounts 
for 55-60 percent of all targets hit; fire from an artillery 
group--up to 25 percent; and fire from batteries and individual 
guns independently--only 15-20 percent of the targets. Thus, in 
modern battle a battalion has to carry out most of the fire 
missions. In doing so, the battalion, using various methods of 
bombardment, is able to create a high density of fire against 
the entire target, destroy it in short time periods, achieve 
surprise, and prevent the target from maneuvering. As a rule, 
the battalion engages the target independently and can be used 
to concentrate fire as part of an artillery group. 
  In carrying out the assigned fire missions, the battalion is 
able to determine the coordinates of various targets with a high 
degree of accuracy using its own assets. The battalion is the 
center for preparation to fire and fire control to the full 
extent prescribed by the "Gunnery and Fire Control Procedures." 
The factors examined above make it possible to consider the 
battalion the basic fire and tactical subunit of artillery. 
<H5>  The Battalion's Place in the Artillery Grouping </H5>
  Modern views of the combat employment of a battalion are 
based on qualitative changes that have taken place in tactics in 
the postwar period. Continuous cooperation of artillery with 
motorized rifle and tank subunits in battle is the basis of 
combat employment of the battalion and one of the main factors 
determining it--the battalion's place in the artillery grouping. 
  The artillery grouping for upcoming combat operations is 
created by decision of the senior combined-arms commander using 
organic and attached artillery. In creating this grouping, the 
battalion, as a rule, is the basic standard unit. Employment of 
the battalion in the grouping being created depends on the 
concept of operations, the battalion's organizational 
affiliation, type (towed or self-propelled) and caliber of guns, 
and the battalion's combat capabilities. Being the basic fire 
and tactical subunit of artillery, the battalion, as a rule, 
operates jointly with a combined-arms unit (subunit), provides 
it powerful fire support, has continuous cooperation with it, 
and thus increases its independence in various types of battle. 
  An artillery battalion as part of a created artillery 
grouping can support a combined-arms unit (subunit), be attached 
to it, or remain on standby with an artillery group commander. 
  A [artillery] battalion assigned to support a battalion, 
remaining subordinate to the senior artillery commander (chief), 
at individual stages of battle carries out missions for delivery 
of fire against the enemy, that are assigned to it by the 
commander of the combined-arms unit (subunit) it is supporting. 
  In an offensive situation (particularly when developing the 
battle deep in the enemy's defenses), in a meeting engagement, 
or in certain conditions in a defensive situation, the battalion 
may be attached to a first-echelon battalion or a battalion 
assigned to the forward detachment (advance guard). 
  An attached battalion becomes fully subordinate to the 
combined-arms unit (subunit) commander and carries out all 
missions he assigns. If the attached battalion was part of the 
artillery group, it is withdrawn from it. 
  Experience shows that at the most crucial moments of a 
battle, when it is necessary to involve a larger amount of 
artillery and centralize its fire control for carrying out fire 
missions, the attached battalion (battery) can be used to carry 
out a mission on decision of the senior combined-arms 
(artillery) commander (chief). This usually takes place when 
repelling counterattacks by superior enemy forces, supporting 
commitment of second echelons, and breaking through densely 
occupied positions of brigade and division reserves and 
intermediate positions deep in enemy defenses. 
  A stand-by battalion, being directly subordinate to the 
artillery group commander, carries out fire missions in support 
of the regiment (battalion) and missions that arise suddenly in 
the shortest possible time. 
  A battalion can remain directly subordinate to the regiment 
commander if an artillery group has not been created in the 
regiment. 
  A battery usually operates as part of the artillery 
battalion 
and can be assigned to support a company (battalion), attached 
to it, or be on standby with the artillery battalion commander. 
<H5>  Combat Capabilities </H5>
  In modern battle, an artillery battalion is capable of 
destroying or neutralizing offensive nuclear and chemical 
weapons, artillery and rocket launcher batteries, mortar 
platoons, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, antitank and other 
weapons, personnel, command posts, air defense weapons, and 
electronics, and of demolishing fortifications. 
  A battalion's capability to destroy various targets in 
battle 
is determined by its fire and maneuver capabilities, and also by 
its range of fire. 
  Fire capabilities represent the artillery 
subunit's capability to carry out a specific number of fire 
missions (to neutralize, destroy, or demolish a given number of 
targets) with the available or allocated amount of ammunition in 
specific conditions within a given time. 
  To determine (calculate) the fire capabilities, it is 
necessary to know the battalion's composition (number of guns), 
the availability (allocated amount) of ammunition, the nature of 
the fire missions, the ammunition expenditure norms for 
destroying given targets, and the required (planned) shell 
density. 
  In addition, one should take into account the strength level 
of gun crews, the level of their combat cohesiveness, their 
political morale, and the conditions in which it is necessary to 
carry out the fire mission. 
  Knowledge of the fire capabilities and the ability to 
determine them in various conditions of the combat situation 
enable the battalion commander to make sound decisions and 
assign realistic missions to batteries for destroying 
reconnoitered targets. 
  In an offensive situation, the fire capabilities are 
calculated by periods of fire engagement of the enemy--for 
artillery preparation of the attack, artillery support of the 
attack, and artillery accompaniment of the troop offensive in 
the depth--taking into account the missions typical for each 
period. 
  The battalion commander independently calculates the fire 
capabilities when carrying out such missions as repelling enemy 
counterattacks, supporting commitment of second echelons, and 
breaking through positions of brigade and division reserves. Let 
us show this using an example. 
  A battalion of 122-mm howitzers (18 guns) is called upon to 
take part in a bombardment during a breakthrough of positions of 
enemy brigade reserves. To carry out the fire missions, the 
battalion is authorized to expend 0.6 units of fire (18 X 48 = 
844 shells), the crews are fully manned, and the actions are 
carried out in the daytime during the spring. 
  It is determined from the maximum rate of the firing table 
that the battalion can expend this amount of shells in 12 
minutes at any charge. 
  Taking into account the nature of the targets to be 
neutralized and the shell expenditure norms, it is calculated 
that a battalion is capable of carrying out the following 
missions with this amount of shells: neutralize one battery of 
self-propelled armored guns, a mortar platoon, and one-two 
individual targets, or neutralize one platoon strong point and 
one-two individual targets, or neutralize six-eight individual 
targets. 
  In conditions of highly mobile actions deep in the enemy's 
defenses and in a meeting engagement, destruction of various 
targets will be accomplished with a lesser shell expenditure 
norm, for example, 0.7-0.8 and sometimes even 0.5 of the norm. 
In this case, the battalion is accordingly capable of carrying 
out a larger number of missions. 
  In a defensive situation, the battalion's fire capabilities 
are calculated according to the effective engagement of the 
enemy for artillery interdiction of the advance and deployment 
of enemy troops, for artillery repelling an enemy attack, and 
for artillery support defending troops in depth and effective 
fire engagement of the enemy when carrying out a counterattack. 
A variant of calculating the fire capabilities of a battalion in 
a defensive situation is shown in the Tactical Example 3. 
  When engaging targets, battalion and battery commanders must 
strive to create a higher fire density. 
  Fire density is the number of shells expended on a 
target in a unit of time. The more intense the shelling of a 
target, the higher the fire density and the higher the level of 
target kill. 
  Based on experience in the Great Patriotic War and 
exercises, 
the fire density for one hectare of target area in one minute 
should be five-10 shells. 
  The high rate of fire of guns and the use of shells having 
different purposes enable a battalion to create high fire 
density and inflict heavy damage on enemy personnel and combat 
equipment. Based on experience in the Great Patriotic War, a 
battalion of twelve 122-mm howitzers fired more than 300 shells 
at a target in five minutes, and almost 700 in 15 minutes. 
  Maneuver capabilities are the ability of the 
battalion to execute a march on various types of terrain in any 
weather, to concentrate secretly in the assigned area, to deploy 
into battle formation in a short period of time to carry out 
fire missions, and to shift from one area of firing positions to 
another. 
  A modern artillery battalion concedes nothing to tank and 
motorized rifle subunits in march capabilities, which ensures 
that it will maintain close cooperation with them in highly 
mobile combat actions. 
  Self-propelled artillery subunits possess higher maneuver 
capabilities. 
  When carrying out fire missions, the artillery battalion 
employs adjustment of fire widely. This involves concentrating 
fire on one target or dispersion of fire to several important 
targets simultaneously without changing firing positions over a 
limited period of time. 
  A battalion's maneuver capabilities are expressed by time 
indicators for executing a march, deploying into battle 
formation, abandoning firing positions, and shifting fire. 
  The firing range of guns shows the battalion's capability to 
engage targets in depth (range of fire). 
<H5>  Order of Battle </H5>
  The artillery battalion's order of battle comprises organic 
and attached forces and assets deployed in accordance with the 
commander's decision to carry out assigned missions. 
  The battalion order of battle (Figure 1) consists 
of the order of battles of batteries and attached artillery 
reconnaissance subunits, a command and observation post, and, if 
necessary, observation posts and fire control posts. 




    The battery order of battle consists of the battle 
formations of gun platoons, a command and observation post, and, 
if necessary, an observation post (forward or lateral). 
  The order of battle of a battalion (battery) should ensure 
the most effective and reliable execution of the assigned fire 
missions, full use of the combat capabilities of subunits, 
maintaining continuous cooperation with combined-arms subunits, 
stable command and control of subunits, the possibility of rapid 
maneuver in the course of battle, and also the least 
vulnerability of subunits to strikes by all types of weapons. 
  The command-observation post (KNP) is intended to 
control the fire and maneuver of subunits, conducting 
reconnaissance of the enemy and observation of the terrain and 
the actions of combined-arms subunits, and maintaining 
cooperation with them. The composition of the command and 
observation post includes the battalion (battery) commander, an 
intelligence officer (headquarters platoon commander), a signals 
officer (depending on the type of combat actions, he may be a 
part of the fire control post), scouts with observation devices, 
and radiotelephone operators (radiotelegraph operators) with 
communications equipment. 
  The battalion (battery) command and observation post is 
situated in the command vehicle or is deployed on the terrain 
jointly with the observation (command-observation) post of the 
combined-arms unit (subunit) to which the battalion (battery) is 
attached or which it is supporting, or near this post. 
  The command-observation post of a standby battalion 
(battery) 
is positioned near the observation (command-observation) post of 
the artillery group (battalion). 
  The command vehicle of a battalion (battery) is intended to 
accommodate personnel comprising the battalion (battery) 
command-observation post and to provide fire control. It is 
equipped with equipment for topogeodetic survey, orientation, 
reconnaissance, observation, communication, and determining 
firing data. This equipment makes it possible to determine with 
a high degree of accuracy the location coordinates of 
command-observation post (vehicle) and targets, to prepare fire 
in a short period of time, and to reduce the time for carrying 
out a fire mission. To use the command vehicles most 
effectively, it is necessary to have a thorough knowledge of the 
automation equipment and devices, their operating principles, 
operating procedures, and the order for input of data. 
  The forward observation post (PNP) is intended to 
conduct reconnaissance of the enemy and observing the terrain 
directly in front of the forward combined-arms subunits, 
maintaining closer contact with them, and servicing battalion 
(battery) fire against targets that cannot be observed from the 
command and observation post. As a rule, the PNP includes an 
intelligence officer (headquarters platoon commander), scouts 
with reconnaissance devices, and a radiotelephone operator with 
communications equipment. 
  The lateral observation post (BNP) is intended to 
conduct reconnaissance of the enemy, service fire, observe the 
terrain and actions of combined-arms subunits in areas not 
observed from the command-observation post, and to organize 
bilateral observation. The BNP consists of the reconnaissance 
squad commander (scout) with the necessary reconnaissance 
devices and communications equipment. 
  The forward and lateral observation posts are sent out by 
the 
battalion (battery) commander in various types of battle to 
selected sites as necessary or for a specific time to carry out 
missions that arise. When organizing bilateral observation, its 
main post is positioned together with the battalion's 
command-observation post, and the other post (right or left) is 
located by itself or with the command-observation post of one of 
the batteries. 
  The battalion fire control post (PUOD) is intended 
to prepare for firing and fire control of the battalion. The 
post includes the battalion chief of staff, a command and 
control group, and radiotelephone operators. It is usually 
located on a command and staff vehicle that is equipped for 
measuring ground meteorological data and compiling approximate 
meteorological messages, processing topogeodetic survey results, 
determining firing data using computers and backup instruments, 
fire control in cooperation with other battalion command 
vehicles, and maintaining reliable communications in the 
battalion. 
  Battery fire platoons deployed at a firing 
position are intended for engaging various enemy targets with 
fire from indirect firing positions or by direct fire. The fire 
platoons are controlled by the senior battery officer who is 
located with the radio operators and plotters in a command 
vehicle or an emplacement. The command vehicle is intended for 
fire control, determining observation post coordinates, and 
orienting guns. The instruments it has make it possible to 
conduct radiation and chemical reconnaissance and also to check 
the terrain for mines. 
  Navigation equipment is capable of working out the current 
coordinates of a vehicle's location and the grid azimuth of the 
vehicle's longitudinal axis, and to plot the route of movement. 
  All this makes it possible to gain a quick orientation 
during 
the course of leading a column and to carry out fire missions 
when deploying gun platoons on the move, when relocating, or on 
the march. 
  A fire position area and a command-observation post line are 
designated for deployment of the battalion into battle formation. 
  A battery is assigned a fire position area (fire position) 
and command-observation post location. Two or three fire 
positions are selected for each battery in the fire position 
area and numbered with two- or three-digit numbers: the first 
digit (first two digits) correspond to the battery number; the 
second (third) digit corresponds to the serial number of the 
position. 
  Battery fire platoons are deployed, as a rule, at one fire 
position. In individual cases, each fire platoon may deploy at 
an independent fire position. 
  Fire position areas may be primary, alternate, or temporary 
areas according to their purpose. 
  The primary fire position area is designated for 
carrying out fire missions in all types of battle. Its distance 
from the forward subunits (forward edge of the battle area) of 
our units depends on the battalion's place in the artillery 
grouping, the range of artillery systems, the nature of the 
terrain, and other situation conditions. 
  The alternate fire position area is usually 
designated in a defensive situation for battalion maneuver 
(battery) and to carry out fire missions during an intentional 
or forced abandonment of the primary fire position area (for 
example, maneuver of a battery due to systematic bombardment by 
artillery or repeated enemy air raids; maneuver of a battalion 
due to contamination of the terrain by toxic or radioactive 
substances). 
  The temporary fire position area (temporary fire 
position for a battery) can be designated for carrying out 
individual fire missions (for supporting combined-arms subunits 
operating in the forward defense area or defending the forward 
position, for firing on distant targets, for carrying out 
missions as roving subunits, and for carrying out other 
missions). 
  The fire position is a sector of terrain occupied 
or prepared for occupation by a battery's gun platoons (platoon, 
gun) for delivery of fire. A battery fire position includes 
places for guns and ammunition, for the battery senior officer's 
vehicle, for personnel shelters, for emplacements for 
self-defense, for the observation post, for prime movers and 
vehicles with ammunition, and for a battery of rocket artillery. 
  In addition, it includes places for a loading point and a 
meteorological station. 
  Fire positions can be indirect or direct. 
  An indirect-fire position is one in which the guns 
(mortars, combat vehicles) are concealed from enemy ground 
observation during delivery of fire. The possibility of 
delivering fire at given minimum quadrant elevations and large 
deflection shifts from the base line, the possibility of direct 
laying during self-defense, and also the availability of 
convenient access routes and camouflage conditions are taken 
into account when selecting an indirect-fire position. As 
experience in the Great Patriotic War shows that it is advisable 
to select fire positions for batteries of gun and howitzer 
artillery primarily on avenues of likely tank approach, which 
will make it possible to destroy enemy tanks and other armored 
targets that have broken through by direct fire. For best 
execution of this mission, fire positions should be selected 
behind natural antitank obstacles and minefields. For mortar and 
missile artillery batteries, taking into account the design 
peculiarities of their weapons, fire positions are selected in 
areas inaccessible to tanks a much as possible. It is not 
recommended that fire positions be selected near prominent local 
features that make it easier for the enemy to reconnoiter and 
fix these positions. 
  Guns are disposed at a fire position taking into account the 
terrain relief with intervals between guns and mortars of 20-40 
meters, and 50-60 meters between rocket artillery combat 
vehicles. 
  To increase the survivability of artillery batteries, the 
guns can be disposed at the fire position in a dispersed manner 
or by platoon, taking into account the terrain's concealing and 
protective features. 
  A direct-fire position is one in which the 
equipment is not concealed from enemy ground observation or, 
being concealed and camouflaged, becomes observable at the start 
of delivery of fire. A direct-fire position is usually selected 
near the disposition of our forward subunits, taking into 
account the possibility of camouflaging the guns and the 
availability of concealed access routes. Fire is delivered by 
direct laying from the direct-fire position to destroy tanks, 
armored vehicles, and various antitank weapons, and also to 
demolish weapon emplacements. 
  When selecting an indirect- or direct-fire position, it is 
necessary to take into account the nature of the soil and the 
level of ground water. Where possible, the soil should be 
sufficiently firm, but not rocky or dusty. Rocky soil increases 
the fragmentation effect of shells in the event the position is 
shelled by the enemy and makes engineer preparation more 
difficult; dusty soil gives away the location of the fire 
position during firing. 
  The artillery prime movers of batteries are positioned to 
the 
rear, right, or left of the fire position in terrain 
irregularities or in prepared shelters at a distance ensuring 
visual contact and rapid movement of the prime movers to the 
guns (mortars). At the locations of prime movers, the drivers 
dig slit trenches and keep a lookout for signals from the 
battery senior officer and the observation post. 
  The battalion may prepare dummy fire positions and 
command-observation post sites according to the plan of the 
senior chief in order to mislead the enemy as to the disposition 
of the artillery subunits. The preparation and camouflage of 
these must not differ sharply from the actual positions and 
sites. A roving battery (platoon, gun) may periodically deliver 
fire from the dummy fire positions. 
<H5>  Types of Fire </H5>
  Targets on the battlefield are distinguished from one 
another 
by size, degree of protection, nature of fire activities, 
maneuverability, and also tactical importance. Therefore, 
artillery subunits deliver fire for effect with the mission of 
destruction, neutralization, or suppression. In addition, they 
may carry out missions for illumination support of the actions 
of motorized rifle and tank subunits (units) and artillery 
firing at night, smoke screening (blinding) the enemy, 
distributing agitation material, and accomplishing target 
designation. 
  Annihilation of a target involves inflicting on it 
such losses (damage) that it completely loses its combat 
effectiveness. When destroying unobserved targets, fire is 
delivered until a designated amount of shells has been expended 
which ensures a kill probability of individual targets equal to 
0.7-0.9 or the mathematical expectation of 50-60 percent targets 
destroyed in a multiple target. 
  Destruction of a target involves rendering it 
unfit for further use. 
  Neutralization of a target involves inflicting 
such losses (damage) on a target or using fire to create such 
conditions that it temporarily loses its combat effectiveness, 
its maneuver is restricted (denied), or command and control is 
disrupted. When neutralizing unobserved multiple targets, 
expenditure of a norm of shells ensures a mathematical 
expectation that 30 percent of the targets are destroyed. 
  Suppression is accomplished by delivering 
harassing fire with a limited number of guns and ammunition for 
the purpose of exerting moral-psychological pressure on enemy 
personnel in defense (concentration) areas, at command posts, in 
rear installations, and so forth. 
  Subunits use the following types of fire in engaging the 
enemy: engagement of a single target; barrage and concentrated 
fire. In addition, an artillery battalion may also be involved 
in delivering concentrated fire, massed fire, successive fire 
concentration, and a rolling barrage. 
  Engagement of a single target is the fire of a 
battery, platoon, or gun delivered independently from an 
indirect- or direct-fire position. Single targets are various 
fire weapons--recoilless guns; ATGM [antitank guided missile] 
launchers; tanks; machine guns; armored personnel carriers in or 
outside of emplacements; observation points (in emplacements or 
mobile); radars; earth-and-timber, armored, and concrete 
emplacements; and so forth. 
  When firing from an indirect-fire position, a battery may 
engage one or (by platoons) two targets simultaneously. When 
platoons fire on two targets simultaneously, one platoon is 
usually controlled by the battery commander, and the other by 
the headquarters platoon commander. 
  To annihilate armored targets and destroy permanent weapon 
emplacements by direct firing, one or two guns are assigned to 
each target. 
  Barrage fire is a solid curtain of fire set up on 
one (NZO-- fixed barrage) or successively on several lines 
(PZO--creeping barrage) in the path of movement of attacking 
(counterattacking) enemy motorized infantry and tanks to inflict 
damage on them, prevent their advance, disrupt the battle 
formations, and create favorable conditions for their 
annihilation by antitank weapons. 
  Barrage fire, as a rule, is prepared in advance on every 
possible axis of enemy attack (counterattack). When necessary, 
barrage fire is prepared during the course of a battle. Barrage 
fire lines should be observable from command-observation and 
observation posts. Howitzer and gun artillery is used to deliver 
barrage fire. 
  The battalion (battery) commander must know precisely the 
location on the terrain of each of the barrage fire lines being 
prepared and ensure that fire is opened in a timely manner on 
these lines. The right to request barrage fire is given to the 
following: all company (battery) commanders and higher have the 
right to call in a fixed barrage; all battalion (artillery 
battalion) commanders and higher have the right to call in a 
creeping barrage. 




    Creeping barrage fire (Figure 2) is prepared on 
the most dangerous avenues of likely tank approach, taking into 
account the fire of antitank weapons of company strong points. 
The first (far) line is set at a distance of approximately 2-4 
km from the forward edge, that is, at a distance from which 
enemy subunits will move in platoon columns and subsequently 
deploy into battle formation. The last line is set at a distance 
of 700-1,000 meters from the forward edge of own troops. 
  The distance between the lines is set at 400-600 meters and 
sometimes more, depending on the observation conditions of each 
line, the possible speed of movement of enemy tanks and armored 
personnel carriers [APC] on given terrain, and the preparedness 
of gun crews. This distance between lines make it possible to 
shift the fire of the artillery battalion from one line to the 
next in a timely manner. 
  Creeping barrage fire on each avenue of likely tank approach 
is given the name of predatory beasts such as, "Lion" and 
"Tiger," and each line is numbered in order beginning with the 
far line--"Lion-1," "Lion-2," and so forth. 
  The frontage of a battalion's creeping barrage is set 
depending on the battalion's composition (not more than 25 
meters per gun). 
  Fire is opened at the moment the lead tank (APC) approaches 
the first (far) line and delivered until the bulk of the tanks 
(APC's) leaves the impact area, after which fire is shifted to 
the next line. If the axis of attack of enemy tanks deviates 
from the prepared creeping barrage fire lines, the battalion 
commander makes the necessary adjustments and continues 
delivering fire on this line or shifts fire to the next line. 
  The enemy attack will usually be carried out by tanks 
jointly 
with infantry, which will advance on APC's (infantry fighting 
vehicles [IFV's]) or on foot behind the tanks. After the main 
group of tanks leaves the zone of fire on the last creeping 
barrage fire line, the mission of artillery is to cut the 
infantry off from the tanks, which can be accomplished with fire 
of the same density as in delivering the creeping barrage. 
Considering that there may be insufficient artillery in a 
defensive situation to cover the forward edge with fire of this 
density, a fixed barrage fire is planned in the immediate 
proximity of the forward edge of the battle area. In this case, 
the battalion's fire is shifted from the last creeping barrage 
fire line to the prepared fixed barrage fire line. Let us 
determine the possible ammunition expenditure for each creeping 
barrage fire line. 
  From the line of deployment into platoon columns, enemy 
tanks 
deploy into battle formation as they approach the forward edge. 
When there are five tanks per platoon, the depth of a platoon 
column will be 150-200 meters. Advancing at a speed of 12-15 
km/hr (200-250 meters per minute), the tanks cover this distance 
(150-200 meters) in roughly one minute. During this time a crew 
of 122-mm howitzers is able to fire six rounds, and a crew of a 
152-mm howitzer four rounds. Under the pressure of the 
battalion's fire on the lines, the attacking tanks may slow down 
their movement somewhat; therefore, the time of delivering fire 
against them may be increased to 1.5 minutes. In this time, up 
to nine 122-mm howitzer shells and six 152-mm howitzer shells 
may be expended on each line, which will be an average of 0.1 
units of fire. This expenditure of shells can be taken as the 
standard for determining a battalion's capabilities and the 
ammunition expenditure to carry out assigned fire missions. 
  In an offensive to repel counterattacks of enemy tanks and 
motorized infantry, fire is continued even after the enemy tanks 
pass, cutting off the infantry from them. In this case, it is 
advisable to designate the last line at a safe distance from 
friendly forward subunits. 
  When preparing a creeping barrage during the course of 
battle, the artillery battalion commander, at the direction of 
the battalion (regimental) commander or on his own initiative, 
determines on the terrain the axis of attack (counterattack) of 
enemy tanks, plots out the first line, and determines the 
coordinates of the right and left points (using a rangefinder, 
bilateral observation, or a different method) and the average 
height, after which he gives the command and plots the location 
of the creeping barrage on the map. Fire on the second line, and 
also on the third if necessary, is similarly prepared. 
  A fixed barrage (Figure 2) is employed to repel an 
attack (counterattack) by enemy infantry and tanks directly in 
front of the forward edge (in front of the forward subunits) of 
own troops. It is prepared by lines no closer than 300 meters 
from the forward edge (forward subunits) when personnel are in 
shelters, and no closer than 400 meters when they are in the 
open. 
  Each fixed barrage line is named for trees such as "Acacia" 
or "Birch" and denoted on work maps by the initial letters of 
the names of the corresponding trees--"A," "B." 
  The frontage of an artillery battalion's fixed barrage 
depends on its composition (not more than 50 meters per gun). 
  Preparation of fixed barrage fire against tree lines, hill 
crests, trenches, and the outskirts of populated areas should be 
avoided. This is explained by the fact that enemy infantry 
initiating an attack or counterattack can be detected only at 
the moment they exit the woods, come out from behind a hill, 
leave the trenches, or come out from the outskirts of the 
populated area. Some 60-70 seconds will pass from the time the 
attacking (counterattacking) enemy is detected and until the 
rounds impact on the fixed barrage line. In this time the enemy 
will be able to cover 120-150 meters, and the fire prepared 
against the tree line or outskirts of the populated area will 
inevitably be late. 
  Consequently, fixed barrage lines must be prepared on 
terrain 
150-200 meters from the tree line, outskirts of the populated 
area, hill crest, or trenches in the direction of the expected 
enemy movement. 
  Fire is opened at the moment the attacking 
(counterattacking) 
infantry approaches the fixed barrage line at a distance in 
which the time it takes the infantry to cover corresponds to the 
flight time of a shell, and volley fire is delivered. Volley 
fire is delivered until the infantry is cut off from the tanks 
or leaves the impact area. 
  Infantry which is halted (has hit the dirt) is engaged as an 
observed stationary target. 
  Enemy infantry going around the prepared fixed barrage line 
is engaged by making a general adjustment for all batteries and 
shifting fire to the new axis of its attack (counterattack). To 
repel an enemy attack (counterattack) in a direction where a 
fixed barrage was not planned, preparation of the fixed barrage 
is conducted immediately before firing, just as for a creeping 
barrage. 




    Concentrated Fire is fire delivered simultaneously 
by several batteries (battalions) on one target (Figure 3). This 
type of fire is employed to engage tactical offensive nuclear 
weapons, personnel and firing weapons in strong points and 
concentration areas, command and command-observation posts, 
artillery and mortar batteries, subunit columns, and other 
observed and unobserved targets. For engaging unobserved targets 
with concentrated battalion fire, the size of the target (taking 
into account the fire capabilities) should not exceed the 
maximum indicated in the Gunnery and Fire Control Procedures. 
  A battalion may use the following methods of shelling 
targets: overlapping fire by batteries; scaled by batteries; and 
allocation of sectors (groups) of targets among batteries. 
  When using overlapping fire by batteries, all batteries open 
fire simultaneously at different range settings relative to the 
target (target center). After expending the designated amount of 
shells, range settings are changed in the sequence indicated in 
Table 1. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Table 1. Sequence of Changing Range Settings When a Battalion Fires on a S-|

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Battery's Number  |Order of Changing Range Settings                        |

|3d Battery        |P + DP            |P - DP            |P                 | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Note: P is the calculated range settings on target (target center); DP is  | 
|the amount of range bound.                                                 | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  This method of shelling ensures a more uniform distribution 
of shell bursts throughout the target area. 
  When batteries fire by scale, all batteries also open fire 
simultaneously at different range settings with respect to the 
target (target center) and deliver fire until a designated 
number of shells have been expended without changing range 
settings. This method of shelling is used when overlapping 
battery fire cannot be used; namely: when engaging enemy columns 
(due to the short time of the bombardment and the lack of time 
to change settings); when firing shells with a time fuse (due to 
the complexity in setting the fuse); and also when delivering 
volley fire by rocket artillery. When firing by scale, range 
settings are accomplished in accordance with the Gunnery and 
Fire Control Procedures: 1st Battery--P - DP; 2d Battery--P; 3d 
Battery--P + DP. 
  Firing with allocation of target areas among the batteries 
is 
used when the size of a stationary unobserved target exceeds the 
maximum size specified in the Gunnery and Fire Control 
Procedures for engagement by concentrated fire using overlapping 
battery fire or firing by scale. 
  When firing for effect as part of an artillery battalion and 
when firing independently, a battery delivers fire at three 
range settings (except when firing shells with a time fuse) and 
at one or two azimuth settings. Fire is delivered at two 
azimuth settings if the sheaf interval exceeds 25 meters when 
engaging covered and armored targets and 50 meters when engaging 
open, unarmored targets. 
  When firing for effect by the battalion and battery, the 
following are designated: a range bound (scale value) 
corresponding to one-third the depth of the target rounded 
downward to whole elevation micrometer scale units; a sheaf 
interval equal to the target frontage divided by the number of 
guns in a battery. 
  Stationary observed multiple targets are neutralized or 
annihilated by battalion or battery fire, designating the size 
and order of target shelling in accordance with the Gunnery and 
Fire Control Procedures. 
  Enemy personnel and fire weapons under cover located in 
observed platoon strong points are engaged by the fire of at 
least two batteries. Shelling methods are designated, based on 
the actual size of the targets, by overlapping battery fire or 
with allocation of target areas among batteries. The disposition 
of fire weapons in a platoon strong point will to a considerable 
extent depend on the terrain relief and also on their use in the 
fire plan. Part of the terrain will prove to be unsuitable for 
positioning fire weapons and preparing trenches. Consequently, 
individual targets in a strong point will be disposed unevenly, 
which will make it possible to specify two or three of the most 
important targets (for example, infantry squads with their fire 
weapons at positions or the location of a company 
command-observation post) and allocate them for engagement among 
battalion batteries. The size of each group of targets and the 
coordinates of their areas are determined for the batteries 
based on available reconnaissance data. Mechanical division of 
the strong point into equal parts according to the number of 
batteries involved is not permissible. This circumstance 
imposes a special responsibility on battalion and battery 
commanders in organizing reconnaissance and determining the real 
location of target groups. Delivery of fire by batteries on 
groups of targets in a platoon strong point makes it possible to 
adjust the fire of each battery, especially for the first 
volleys in bombardments, which considerably increases the 
effectiveness of firing. 
  Successive fire concentration--single, double, or 
triple--is used for supporting an attack or counterattack of 
motorized-rifle and tank subunits and units (Figure 4). It 
involves neutralizing enemy personnel and fire weapons on the 
front and on the flanks of attacking subunits by concentrated 
fire successively shifted against targets in the enemy's depth. 
  For successive fire concentration, targets are designated 
beginning at the forward edge of the enemy's positions and to 
the depth of first-echelon battalions and more; observed targets 
are designated directly on the ground, and unobserved targets 
according to reconnaissance data and the map. These targets 
include platoon strong points, antitank weapons, radars, 
command-observation posts, and observation posts. 
  The planned targets are connected by lines. One line 
pertains 
to targets located roughly the same distance from the forward 
edge. The distance between the lines may be from 300 to 1,000 
meters. The lines are named after predatory beasts such as 
"Lion," "Tiger," and so forth; the targets are given a 
three-digit number, the first digit of which indicates the line 
number, and the other two the number of the target on the line, 
for example, 114, 115, 224, 225, and so forth. The line 
designation is the signal for opening (shifting) fire against 
all targets of a given line. A battalion is assigned one group 
target (platoon strong point) or two-three single targets on 
each successive fire concentration line. The size of the group 
target should not exceed six hectares for battalions having up 
to and including 100-mm guns and mortars of all calibers in 
their inventory, and nine hectares for battalions with guns over 
100-mm. 
  A battery delivers fire as part of the battalion or 
independently. In independent delivery of fire, a battery is 
assigned one target whose size does not exceed two and three 
hectares, respectively, for the calibers indicated above. 
  Fire is opened against targets on the first successive fire 
concentration line on a prearranged signal with the beginning of 
movement of attacking subunits from the final coordination line 
(actually, fire is continued against targets of the last 
bombardment of the artillery preparation of the attack, if these 
same targets are designated for neutralization in artillery 
support of the attack). Without allowing a break in fire, it 
continues until the tanks and motorized-rifle subunits reach a 
safe distance from the impact area of friendly shells. Fire is 
shifted to targets on the second line on the signal of the 
battalion or regimental commander. Fire is also delivered 
against targets on the second line until the attacking subunits 
reach a safe distance from the impact area of friendly shells. 
This sequence of shifting fire is maintained through the entire 
depth of successive fire concentration. 
  The present-day defense is saturated with antitank weapons, 
particularly ATGM's, which are staggered in depth. These weapons 
are capable of engaging tanks and APC's at great distances. In 
this regard, it is necessary to neutralize antitank weapons and 
other targets not only directly in front of the attacking 
subunits, but also at successive lines in depth. In such 
conditions it is advisable to employ double (triple) successive 
fire concentration, which is accomplished by two (three) 
artillery groups. 
  The first artillery group delivers fire against targets 
situated directly in front of the attacking subunits; the second 
group does so against targets on the next deeper line, beginning 
with the second line. When shifting the fire of the first 
artillery group against targets on the second line, the second 
artillery group shifts fire to targets on the third line. 
Subsequent shifting of fire is accomplished in the same sequence. 
  Concentrated fire and fire against single targets, 
particularly enemy antitank weapons, is planned and delivered 
against targets between the successive fire concentration lines. 




    A rolling barrage--single or double--is used to 
support an attack by tanks and motorized rifle subunits when the 
enemy's defense has a dense network of trenches and connecting 
passages that make it difficult to determine precisely the 
location of strong points, and also when breaking through a 
fortified area. A rolling barrage is a solid curtain of fire 
sequentially shifted by lines ahead of the attacking subunits to 
neutralize enemy personnel and fire weapons. It can be employed 
in combination with other types of fire. Main and intermediate 
lines are designated when planning a rolling barrage. The 
distance between the main lines may be 300-1,000 meters 
depending on the expected pace of the attack and the nature of 
enemy defenses. The main lines are designated according to the 
probable locations of enemy personnel and fire weapons: against 
trenches, strong points, antitank weapon positions, and other 
targets. 
  The first rolling barrage main line is planned, as a rule, 
along the main line (along the first trench) of enemy resistance. 
  Intermediate rolling barrage lines are planned to neutralize 
personnel and fire weapons located between the main lines and to 
prevent the enemy from maneuvering by trenches and connecting 
passages. The distance between the intermediate lines is 100-300 
meters, depending on the nature of the enemy defenses, terrain 
conditions, and the planned pace of the attack. 
  The battalion's sector of the rolling barrage is divided 
into 
battery sectors, the size of which is determined by figuring no 
more than 15 meters for guns up to and including 100-mm caliber 
and mortars of all calibers, and 25 meters for guns over 100-mm 
caliber. 
  Fire is shifted from the main rolling barrage lines on the 
command (signal) of the motorized rifle (tank) regiment 
commander after the attacking subunits have reached a safe 
distance from the impact area of our shells. The regimental 
commander's signal is received directly by the commanders of 
those artillery battalions that are delivering fire in this 
regiment's offensive sector. Fire is shifted from the 
intermediate lines on the command of artillery battalion 
commanders at the end of the established time of delivering 
fire, which is usually two-three minutes. 
  A double rolling barrage is delivered by two artillery 
groups. The first group delivers fire just as in a single 
rolling barrage; the second group does so only on the main 
lines, beginning with the second line. 
  In order to preclude hitting friendly troops, the artillery 
battalion commander must use the most accurate methods of 
determining firing data and charges ensuring the least 
dispersion, avoid switching from one charge to another and 
firing charges of different lots, and deliver fire using 
high-explosive fragmentation rounds for fragmentation effect. He 
must continually observe friendly shellbursts, the location of 
friendly forward subunits, and the signals of combined-arms 
subunit commanders, particularly when delivering a successive 
fire concentration and rolling barrage. He must cease or open 
fire in a timely manner on the next line at the signal. 
  It is permissible to begin firing for effect without 
registration with a high-explosive fragmentation round and a 
round with a time fuse when determining settings based on 
deliberate preparation of fire. Firing may also begin using data 
of registration guns, and shifting fire from registration points 
(targets) and delivering fire against targets located no closer 
than 500 meters from friendly troops located outside of shelters 
or in unarmored vehicles at a distance up to 10 km and no closer 
than 700 meters at a distance of over 10 km, and no closer than 
300 and 500 meters, respectively, from friendly troops located 
in shelters (emplacements, tanks, and other armored vehicles). 
  Rocket artillery firing is permitted against targets located 
no closer than 1,000 meters from friendly forward subunits. 
  If fire is delivered against a target in the course of 
artillery support of the attack (counterattack) and during 
battle in the depth of the enemy's defense, a safe distance from 
the impact area of friendly shells is considered: 
  --400 meters for motorized rifle subunits attacking in 
dismounted formation; 
  --300 meters for motorized rifle subunits attacking on 
APC's; 
  --200 meters for tank subunits. 
<H5>  Chapter 2. Command and Control of the Battalion </H5>
<H5>  Essence and Procedure of Command and Control </H5>
  Command and control of a battalion (battery) in combat are 
the purposeful, practical activities of combined-arms and 
artillery commanders, staffs, and political workers to maintain 
high combat readiness, prepare combat operations of subunits, 
and direct them in carrying out assigned missions. It must be 
stable, continuous, and secure. 
  The basis of command and control of the artillery battalion 
(battery) is the decision of the commander of the regiment 
(battalion, company) of which it is a part (to which it is 
attached or assigned for support) or the decision (order) of the 
senior artillery commander (chief). 
  The commander of the regiment (battalion, company) is the 
main organizer of the combat operations of organic, attached, 
and supporting subunits. He bears personal responsibility for 
their successful accomplishment of combat missions. He alone is 
given the right to make the battle plan. In organizing combat, 
the regiment (battalion, company) commander performs work during 
the course of which he makes the decision, gives combat missions 
to subordinate commanders, organizes cooperation, and carries 
out measures to support combat operations and prepare subunits 
to carry out combat missions. 
  Successful execution of missions in combat is possible 
because of artillery commanders' and staffs' in-depth and 
thorough knowledge of the fundamentals of combined-arms combat 
and their duties; prompt execution of orders, instructions, and 
commands; and also intelligent initiative and creative activity. 
  In complex, combat conditions, a commander must make 
competent decisions in extremely short periods of time and be 
able to implement them in combat. In order to make a sound 
decision and, the main thing, implement it, it is necessary to 
have firm practical training based on sound theoretical 
knowledge. 
  Command and control of a battalion (battery) includes: 
maintaining constant combat readiness and high political morale 
of personnel; continuous collection and study of information 
about the enemy; a firm knowledge of the location and status of 
subordinate subunits and the mission being carried out by them; 
timely decisionmaking and tasking of subordinates; maintaining 
continuous cooperation with the regiment (battalion, company) to 
which the artillery battalion (battery) is attached or which it 
is supporting; constant monitoring of accomplishment of assigned 
missions and providing assistance to subunits; restoring the 
combat effectiveness of subunits subjected to air (combat 
helicopter) strikes, artillery fire, and the effects of weapons 
of mass destruction. 
  Constant combat readiness of the battalion is maintained by 
a 
high state of training of personnel; cohesiveness of all 
subunits; their ability to operate in the most difficult combat 
situation conditions; the strength level of the subunits; 
maintaining weapons, transport, communications equipment, and 
reconnaissance and fire control instruments in serviceable 
condition; and also constant technical and rear services support. 
  Modern combat requires high moral-political and 
psychological 
qualities and physical staunchness of personnel. Each soldier's 
persistent personal responsibility, firm political conviction, 
awareness, allegiance to the oath, and unshakable resolve in 
carrying out a combat mission are qualities developed by the 
daily life of the Soviet citizen, the systematic political 
education of Army and Navy personnel, and their combat training. 
Military indoctrination is the duty of commanders at all levels. 
  The battalion (battery) commander bears full 
responsibility for prompt opening of fire and carrying out of 
missions by subordinate subunits. He must always know the 
position, status, and capabilities of subordinate subunits. 
  The battalion (battery) commander controls subunits by 
issuing verbal combat orders and instructions, and also by 
commands and signals. 
  A verbal combat order is issued simultaneously to all 
commanders of subordinate subunits in the prescribed volume and 
sequence, usually when there is sufficient time for preparation 
of combat operations. 
  Combat instructions are issued to the commanders of subunits 
involved in carrying out a mission. They contain the data 
necessary to do this. Combat instructions are usually issued 
when there is not enough time to prepare for combat operations 
or in the course of combat. In addition, instructions assign 
missions for reconnaissance, protection from weapons of mass 
destruction, topogeodetic survey, and other types of combat 
support. 
  Commands are issued to assign fire missions and to request, 
adjust, shift, or cease fire. A signal is given to specify the 
time for executing an assigned mission (the beginning of 
artillery preparation, attack support, shelling, and so forth); 
the beginning of planned actions (a movement or maneuver, 
deployment into combat formation, and so forth); for maintaining 
cooperation with the regiment (battalion, company); for warning 
subunits; for reporting mission execution (crossing of control 
lines, concentration in a designated area, and so forth). 
  The battalion (battery) commander deploys the command and 
observation post in a location that provides the best 
observation of the terrain, enemy, and actions of friendly 
subunits and adjacent units, and ensures uninterrupted 
cooperation with the regiment (battalion, company) and command 
and control of subunits and their fire. In all cases, the 
command and observation post must stand out in the combat 
formation of subunits waging combat, and it is necessary to use 
protective terrain features skillfully for its disposition and 
movement. 
  The command and observation post of the artillery battalion 
(battery) assigned to support a regiment (battalion, company) or 
attached to it is usually deployed jointly with the battalion 
(company) command and observation post or near it. When the 
artillery battalion (battery) command and observation post is 
temporarily deployed a considerable distance from the battalion 
(company) commander's command and observation post due to 
situation conditions, communications with the latter is 
accomplished by technical means or via a forward observation 
post dispatched to it. 
  The command and observation post of an artillery battalion 
assigned as standby is usually deployed near the observation 
post of the artillery group (regiment). For most cooperation, 
the command and observation posts of the batteries of a standby 
battalion are deployed as close as possible to the command posts 
of first-echelon combined-arms subunits. 
  For convenience of battalion fire control, it is advisable 
to 
assign one of the batteries as a standby and position its 
command and observation post near that of the battalion. 
  The artillery battalion staff plays an important 
role in preparing combat operations and ensuring firm and 
continuous command and control of subunits in the course of 
combat. It constantly works in close cooperation with the 
battalion (regiment) staff and simultaneously carries out 
instruction of the higher artillery staff. 
  The artillery battalion chief of staff is responsible for 
organizing and maintaining continuous command and control of 
subunits and timely preparation and accuracy of fire. He is 
responsible for the following: knowing the position, 
composition, and nature of operations of the enemy; the position 
and mission of the battalion (regiment) to which he is attached 
or which he is supporting and the position, status and 
capabilities of the artillery battalion's subunits; planning the 
artillery battalion's combat operations and disseminating 
missions to the subunits; organizing comprehensive support of 
the artillery battalion's combat operations; arranging the 
determination of firing data and supervising the work of the 
battalion's fire control post; directing the movement and 
deployment into combat formation of fire subunits; organizing 
stable communications and protection against electronic 
countermeasures by the enemy and ensuring secure command and 
control of subunits. In addition he must organize surveillance 
of and warning about the air enemy and disseminate to subunits 
the methods and signals for identifying friendly aircraft 
(helicopters); monitor the readiness of subunits to carry out 
assigned missions and the execution of instructions; inform 
subunit commanders about the situation and keep track of 
personnel, weapons and equipment, ammunition, fuel, and other 
materiel, and, in addition, the radiation doses of personnel. 
Paper work includes keeping a record of instructions and reports 
issued and received; submitting reports to higher headquarters; 
and studying past combat experience and disseminating it to 
battalion personnel. 
  The artillery battalion commander determines the location of 
the battalion staff. The staff usually travels at the head of 
the battalion column when executing a march or when moving up to 
the deployment area. After the battalion deploys into combat 
formation, the staff is usually located in the vicinity of a 
fire position of one of the batteries 300-500 meters from the 
guns, deploying the battalion fire control post. 
  Restoring the combat effectiveness of subunits is one of the 
most important duties of the artillery battalion and battery 
commanders. It includes: restoring disrupted command and 
control; ascertaining the degree of combat effectiveness of 
subunits; detailing missions to subunits that have retained 
combat effectiveness; withdrawing subunits from contaminated 
zones and areas of destruction, fires, and flooding; providing 
subunits with replacement personnel and replenishing their 
weapons, equipment, ammunition, fuel, and other supplies; 
maintaining high political morale and psychological 
steadfastness of personnel. 
  The combat effectiveness of those subunits that have 
suffered 
the fewest personnel and combat equipment losses is the first 
restored. 
  Quick restoration of disrupted command and control is 
possible by ordering a number of measures restored while 
organizing combat operations. These measures include arranging 
for one of the battery commanders to assume command and control 
of the battalion; dispersal of command and observation posts; 
establishing a procedure for battery commanders to enter the 
radio net of the commanders of the artillery group and the 
supported battalion (regiment); designating alternate radio 
operating data; and other measures. 
  The battery command and observation post farthest from the 
artillery battalion command and observation post is designated 
in advance to assume command and control of the artillery 
battalion in the event its command posts are knocked out. The 
commander of this battery is provided the fire plan, radio 
operating data, and the call signs of stations and officials. He 
plots the necessary data for the battalion on his work map. 
  The battery commander assuming command and control of the 
battalion must: notify battery commanders of assuming command 
and control by the prescribed signal, and reporting the 
coordinates of his command and observation post; receive reports 
from battery commanders on their receipt of the signals, 
coordinates of their observation posts and command and 
observation posts, and information on the availability of guns 
and ammunition; report to the senior artillery commander (chief) 
on the assumption of command and control of the battalion, the 
coordinates of his command and observation post, and, if 
necessary, the status of subunits and data on the enemy; 
establish cooperation with the battalion (regiment) commander; 
and assign reconnaissance and fire missions to subunits. All 
battery commanders in the artillery battalion must be ready to 
assume command and control of the battalion. 
  During the course of combat, disrupted command and control 
with subordinate subunits is restored immediately. The artillery 
battalion commander (battery commander assuming command and 
control of the battalion) first of all must find out and assess 
the cause of disruption of command and control, and take steps 
to restore it. They include: command and control of the fire 
platoons of those batteries whose command and observation posts 
have been knocked out; restoring the battery and fire platoon 
command and observation posts put out of action by using other 
subunits; moving command posts from contaminated zones or 
shelling area to other places. 
  The battalion (battery) commander reports to the senior 
commander (chief) on the results of the enemy's use of weapons 
of mass destruction, the status and combat effectiveness of 
subunits, and the steps taken to restore it. 
<H5>  Preparation for Combat Operations </H5>
  Preparation for the combat operations of a battalion 
(battery) begins with the battalion (battery) commander's 
receipt of the mission from the senior artillery commander 
(chief). 
  The battalion commander fully briefs his deputies and the 
chief of staff on the situation and the mission received. 
  The sequence (order) of the work of the commander, deputy 
commander for political affairs, battalion staff, and battery 
commanders for preparing for combat operations depends on the 
mission received, the order of work of the battalion (company) 
commander, and the time available. The artillery battalion 
commander will have the most complete information with the 
receipt of the combat order. It should also be taken into 
account that the highly mobile conditions of modern combat and 
rapidly changing situations will limit the time for preparing 
for combat operations. In such conditions, subunit commanders 
must use the sequence of work which would ensure preparation of 
the subunits to carry out the mission in the designated time 
period. 
  A variant of the sequence of work by officials for preparing 
for combat operations of the artillery battalion (battery) is 
given in Table 2. 




<H5>    Decisionmaking </H5>
  Making a decision that corresponds to the conditions of the 
situation at hand is possible only on the basis of a thorough 
clarification of the mission received and comprehensive 
assessment of the situation. 
  The artillery (battery) commander clarifies the mission 
while 
it is being received and plots it on the map. In doing so, he 
must understand: the combat mission and the concept of the 
commander of the combined-arms unit (subunit) to which the 
battalion (battery) is attached or which it is supporting; the 
missions being carried out by assets of the senior commander 
(chief) on the axis of operations of the combined-arms unit 
(subunit); the missions of adjacent units and the procedure for 
cooperation with them; the missions of the battalion (battery) 
for fire engagement of the enemy, and the areas of observation 
posts and command and observation posts; the base line of fire 
and the methods of determining range and azimuth settings for 
most effective firing; the time and order for the battalion 
(battery) to move to the designated area and the order of 
maneuver during the course of combat; and the readiness time for 
carrying out the mission. 
  As a result of clarification of the mission, the artillery 
battalion (battery) commander determines the measures that must 
be carried out immediately and gives instructions for their 
execution. When calculating time, he determines how much total 
time is available to prepare the battalion for combat 
operations, including daylight time. He plans the primary 
measures for preparing subunits and the time periods for 
carrying them out, taking into account measures being carried 
out by the senior artillery commander (chief) and the battalion 
(company) commander. Variants of calculating the time by the 
artillery battalion commander are given in the tactical examples. 
  Experience shows that it is advisable to record the planned 
measures and timing in a special tablet, in a notebook, or on 
the back of the work map. The planned sequence of carrying out 
measures is tentative. Necessary updates are made as the 
situation changes. 
  When organizing preparation of subunits for combat 
operations, the artillery battalion commander indicates to the 
chief of staff the following: measures for preparing personnel, 
armament, equipment, and ammunition; the order of replenishing 
supplies; the time and order of work to organize combat 
operations on the terrain; and other measures which must be 
conducted for the most rapid preparation of the subunits. 
  The artillery battalion commander (chief of staff) tasks the 
battalion. He assigns tasks of organizing reconnaissance of the 
enemy to the battalion intelligence officer (the battery 
commander tasks the headquarters platoon commander). He tasks 
the chief of the artillery reconnaissance group for 
reconnaissance of the fire position area. 
  In assessing the situation, the battalion (battery) 
commander 
must determine the effect of each element of the situation 
individually and together as he assesses the accomplishment of 
the mission; he also must establish what must be done to 
eliminate or lessen the effect of negative factors. 
  The information, subject to assessment, is often incomplete 
and frequently contradictory. It should be taken into account 
that the available information on the situation may prove to be 
outdated in a short time. Therefore, the battalion (battery) 
commander must be constantly concerned about receiving new 
information. 
  When assessing the situation, the battalion (battery) 
commander must study the enemy's position, composition, and 
possible nature of his actions, and the position, status, fire 
capabilities, and state of supply of battalion (battery) 
subunits; take into account the position and missions of 
adjacent artillery subunits, the nature of the terrain and its 
effect on the combat operations of the battalion (battery), the 
radiation, chemical, and biological situation, the weather, the 
time of day, and season of the year. 
  From the assessment of each situation element, the battalion 
(battery) commander determines the following basic conclusions 
to be used for the best preparation of the battalion (battery) 
for accomplishing the assigned mission: 
  --From the assessment of the enemy: reconnaissance missions, 
additional fire missions, and measures for protection against 
weapons of mass destruction; 
  --From the assessment of the position and status of the 
battalion (battery): measures for preparing equipment, 
instruments, communications equipment, and primary artillery 
movers, and for replenishing stores of ammunition and other 
supplies; the ability of the battalion subunits to carry out 
fire missions with the amount of ammunition issued in the 
prescribed time, taking into account the maximum rate of fire; 
  --From the assessment of the terrain: battery fire position 
areas, sites for the battery and battalion command and 
observation posts, and also the conditions of performing 
topogeodetic preparation; places difficult to negotiate on the 
movement routes or when executing a march; detours of areas of 
destruction and obstacles; the order of engineer preparation of 
fire positions and command and observation post sites, and 
measures for camouflage, local security, and self-defense; 
  --From the assessment of the radiation, chemical, and 
biological situation: the degree of combat effectiveness of the 
battalion (battery) depending on the received and expected 
radiation doses and the degree of contamination, and also 
measures for protecting battalion personnel; 
  --According to the weather, time of day, and season of the 
year: measures for warming up personnel, maintaining access 
routes to the fire positions in a passable state, preparing fire 
platoons for delivering fire and command and observation 
(observation) posts for conducting reconnaissance and fire 
control at night. 
  Based on the clarification of the mission and assessment of 
the situation, the battalion commander specifies in his 
decision: the distribution of batteries for support of 
combined-arms subunits; fire missions for batteries, fire 
position areas and command and observation sites, and the time 
and order of occupying them and moving during the course of 
combat; basic measures for comprehensive support of combat 
operations; and organization of command and control. 
<H5>  Work on the Terrain </H5>
  As the experience of the Great Patriotic War indicates, one 
of the conditions of successful accomplishment of assigned 
missions in combat is reliable knowledge of the terrain and the 
ability of commanders to orient themselves on it quickly and 
accurately. 
  The diversity of situation conditions (type of combat, 
battalion position, nature of the terrain, operating procedures 
of the combined-arms and senior artillery commander or chief, 
availability of time, and so forth) results in different 
operating procedures of commanders on the terrain. 
  When working on the terrain, the artillery battalion 
(battery) commander usually participates in the work of the 
senior artillery commander (chief) or the commander of the 
regiment (battalion, company) which the artillery battalion has 
been assigned to support or to which it has been attached. He 
also works on the terrain independently with subordinate 
commanders. During the course of the senior artillery 
commander's (chief's) reconnaissance, the artillery battalion 
commander must study the terrain carefully. He must make clear 
the names of local features and reference points, the targets to 
be engaged by battalion fire and other subunits in the zone of 
operations of the supported battalion (regiment). The combat 
mission assignment for commanders of the battalion (regiment), 
an artillery battalion assigned as a standby battalion, or the 
artillery group commander must clearly indicate if he is left 
directly subordinate to the regimental commander. 
  After being assigned the mission from the senior artillery 
commander (chief), the artillery battalion (battery) commander 
must report at the designated time to the commander of the 
regiment (battalion, company) which the battalion (battery) has 
been assigned to support or to which it has been attached. He 
must report the following: the composition, position, status, 
and state of supply of the artillery battalion (battery); the 
missions received and the established ammunition expenditure, 
the fire capabilities of the artillery battalion (battery), the 
designated areas for the fire positions and command and 
observation posts, and the time and order of occupying them; the 
order of movement (maneuver) during the course of combat; and 
the readiness time for opening fire. He must also be ready to 
answer any question the battalion (company) commander may have 
regarding the employment of the artillery battalion (battery) in 
combat. (Variants of the artillery battalion commander's 
report are given in the tactical examples.) 
  The artillery battalion (battery) commander arrives at the 
designated location promptly to participate in the regimental 
(battalion, company) commander's work. Experience shows that in 
offensive operations beginning in the assembly area, it is 
advisable to begin work on organizing cooperation in the 
assembly area, and then on the terrain in the course of 
commander's reconnaissance. In offensive operations beginning 
with direct contact with the enemy or when shifting to the 
defense, it is desirable that the artillery battalion commander 
participate in the regimental (battalion) commander's 
reconnaissance at the start. When participating in the 
regimental (battalion) commander's reconnaissance, the artillery 
battalion commander receives his tasks and instructions on 
cooperation from the regimental commander. 
  The artillery battalion commander independently conducts 
reconnaissance only if there is enough time. It includes the 
intelligence and signal officers and battery commanders. In 
favorable situation conditions, the chief of staff may also be 
involved in the commander's reconnaissance. 
  Considering that an extremely limited amount of time will be 
allotted to organizing combat operations in modern combat, the 
artillery battalion commander will usually combine his work on 
the terrain and that of his subordinate commanders with the work 
of the battalion (regiment) commander, that is, conduct it in 
parallel. In doing so, the battery commanders and other 
battalion officers, located near the reconnaissance group of the 
combined-arms commander, study the terrain and fire missions and 
organize their work at the direction of the artillery battalion 
commander. 
  The organization of combat operations when shifting from a 
defensive to an offensive operation, following the necessary 
regrouping, can be accomplished when the battalion has deployed 
into combat formation and is carrying out fire missions. In this 
case, the artillery battalion commander usually involves only 
the commanders of batteries assigned to support companies in the 
commander's reconnaissance as preparation for carrying out the 
new mission. 
  For successful accomplishment of a large amount of work on 
the terrain to organize combat operations, the artillery 
battalion plans in advance the composition of the group, the 
location and time of work, and issues to be resolved at each 
location, and prepares data for assigning missions (issuing the 
combat order) to subunits and for updating cooperation 
procedures. 
<H5>  Assignment of Missions to Subunits </H5>
  After the commander's reconnaissance, the artillery 
battalion 
(battery) commander indicates the following in the combat order 
when assigning missions: 
  In the first paragraph--brief conclusions from the 
assessment of the enemy and the nature of his actions; 
  In the second paragraph--the mission of the 
regiment (battalion, company), missions of adjacent units, and 
boundaries with them; 
  In the third paragraph--the objectives (targets) 
to be engaged by assets of senior commanders (chiefs) on the 
regiment's (battalion's, company's) axis of operations, and 
safety limits; 
  In the fourth paragraph--the mission of the 
artillery battalion or battery (place in the artillery grouping 
and who it is supporting), the base line of fire, method of 
determining azimuth and range settings for firing for effect, 
and the order of moving to contact, deployment, and changing 
position in the course of combat; 
  In the fifth paragraph after the words "I 
order"--the missions for the batteries (platoons); 
  In the sixth paragraph--ammunition expenditure; 
  In the seventh paragraph--time of readiness for 
carrying out the mission; 
  In the eighth paragraph--the location of the 
artillery battalion (battery) command and observation post and 
the battalion fire control post; who is to assume command and 
control of the artillery battalion (battery) in the event the 
command and observation post is knocked out. 
  Before issuing the combat order on the terrain, the 
artillery 
battalion (battery) commander indicates the prearranged name 
designations of local features and reference points, if they 
were not indicated earlier. 
  Immediately after assigning missions, the artillery 
battalion 
commander updates the procedures for maintaining cooperation 
with combined-arms subunits. By giving directions and listening 
to subordinates, he makes sure battery commanders understand the 
order of accomplishment of the combat mission by tank and 
motorized rifle subunits and the fire missions for supporting 
them in the course of combat. 
  The experience of the Great Patriotic War showed that 
coordinated actions of subunits of various branches of troops 
made it possible to carry out combat missions with the least 
loss. 
  In organizing combat operations, the artillery battalion 
commander (chief of staff) tasks subordinates for comprehensive 
support of combat operations, organizing communications, and 
political work by separate instructions. Comprehensive support 
of combat operations is broken down into combat (artillery 
reconnaissance; protection against weapons of mass destruction; 
camouflage; engineer support; chemical support; topogeodetic, 
meteorological, and ballistic preparation for firing; and local 
security), technical, and rear services support. 
  In the course of combat, missions are disseminated to the 
subunits by field instructions, in which the artillery battalion 
(battery) commander usually indicates: brief information about 
the enemy; the combat mission of the battalion (company); the 
mission of the battery (platoon) and the time of readiness for 
carrying it out; and, if necessary, other data. 
<H5>  Planning Combat Operations </H5>
  The artillery battalion staff plans the battalion's combat 
operations based on the missions received from the senior 
artillery commander (chief) or battalion (regiment) commander 
and the instructions of the artillery battalion commander. 
  Planning combat operations includes planning and scheduling 
fire, maneuver, and comprehensive support of the battalion's 
combat operations. 
  Planning and scheduling fire of the artillery 
battalion is accomplished by periods (missions) of fire 
engagement of the enemy. When planning and scheduling fire, 
the battalion staff determines the volume of fire missions; 
updates the position and size of observed targets on the 
terrain; calculates the fire capabilities of the batteries and 
allocates fire missions among the batteries; determines the 
coordinates of targets and aiming points of the batteries for 
engaging group targets, taking into account the specific 
disposition of individual targets; establishes the sequence and 
order of execution of fire missions by batteries; determines 
ammunition expenditure by each type of target and methods of 
shelling; draws up a battalion fire plan and disseminates 
excerpts from it to the batteries; determines the firing data 
for artillery battalions and prepares a table of the computed 
data. 
  Fire missions are allocated among the batteries taking into 
account their fire capabilities, the disposition and firing 
range of batteries, the least expenditure of rounds for given 
conditions, and the possibility of observing and adjusting 
battery fire. Planning and scheduling of fire is constantly 
updated as new reconnaissance information on the enemy and new 
fire missions are received. 
  When planning a maneuver, the artillery battalion 
staff determines: the order of movement toward contact and the 
deployment of the battalion into combat formation; new fire 
position areas, and the route and order of relocating to them; 
the time needed for the relocation and the times of readiness to 
carry out the missions at the new areas; lines for beginning the 
relocation and readiness (if not indicated by the senior 
commander); the order of relocating battalion and battery 
command and observation posts; deployment lines and the order of 
relocating artillery reconnaissance subunits. 
  Planning comprehensive support of the combat 
operations of the artillery battalion includes planning 
reconnaissance, protection against weapons of mass destruction, 
camouflage, engineer and chemical support, topogeodetic, 
meteorological and ballistic preparation, local security, and 
technical, logistical and medical support. 
  The results of planning combat operations are reflected on 
the work maps, in the combat order and instructions of the 
artillery battalion commander and staff, and in other documents 
listed in Table 3.

  The work map is the basic document, and often the

subunits in combat. Every officer keeps a work map both when 
preparing combat operations and in the course of them. All the 
data necessary for carrying out assigned missions is plotted on 
the work map. 
  The following is plotted on the work map of the artillery 
battalion commander (chief of staff): the disposition of enemy 
forces and assets; the composition, position, and combat 
missions of the combined-arms subunit (unit) to the extent 
necessary for cooperation; missions being carried out by assets 
of the senior commander (chief) and other artillery subunits in 
the interests of the supported subunit (unit); the command post 
of the senior artillery commander (chief); the fire positions of 
the battalion and batteries, indicating target numbers; planned 
(prepared) fire position areas and command and observation post 
sites; the base line of fire; reference points; lines, points, 
and positions of attached artillery reconnaissance assets; the 
maximum and minimum firing range for each fire position area; 
the routes and order of moving to contact, deployment, 
relocation, and maneuver; safety lines; control, warning, and 
coordinating signals; areas of destruction, obstruction, and 
fires; sectors of flooding; and zones of radioactive, chemical, 
and bacteriological contamination. The call signs of 
communications operating stations (centers) and officials, and 
signals are recorded on the map; a record of the expenditure and 
availability of ammunition is kept. 
  The fire plan is drawn up by the artillery 
battalion staff as a separate document, both in an offensive and 
a defensive situation. Excerpts from the fire plan are given to 
the battery commanders. 
  The table of computed battalion firing data is 
compiled and constantly kept up by the artillery battalion staff 
(battalion fire control post) during preparations for and in the 
course of combat operations. This document enables the chief of 
staff to monitor the correctness of computed firing data 
calculation in the batteries for all planned and unplanned 
targets. 
  The range card [landmarks only] is intended for 
facilitating study of the terrain, orienting on it, and target 
designation, and for convenience of assigning missions (Figure 
6). It is compiled by the intelligence officer (headquarters 
platoon commander, reconnaissance squad commander). 




    The log of instructions and reports issued and 
received is kept to record all instructions issued by the 
commander and chief of staff to the commanders of subordinate 
subunits for preparing to conduct combat operations, all 
instructions received from the senior commander (staff), and 
also reports transmitted to higher headquarters. The format of 
the log and an example of how it is filled out are shown in 
Table 4.

<H5>  Organization of Communications </H5>
  Radio, landline, mobile, and signal communications equipment 
are used for continuous command and control of battalion 
subunits in the most diverse combat situation conditions. 
  Communications by radio is the main, and in many cases the 
only, means of command and control of battalion subunits in 
modern combat when conducting combat operations. Radio 
communications in the battalion, taking into account the 
availability of forces and assets, are organized by radio nets 
and radio links. 
  Landline communications, as a rule, are organized as a 
defensive system, when preparing an offensive move, and when 
disposed at a site. This type of communication is convenient for 
conversing, is relatively secure compared to radio 
communications, and almost completely precludes enemy jamming. 
  Mobile communications are used in all types of combat 
operations of the artillery battalion for the purpose of 
relaying verbal and written instructions and reports and are 
accomplished by transport and messengers available in the 
battalion. 
  Flares, lanterns, handflags, sirens, and other means are 
used 
as signal devices for warning subunits and relaying commands. 
  Communications equipment in the battalion must be used 
comprehensively and ensure the reliability, speed, timeliness, 
and security of transmission in any situation. 
  Available UHF radios in the battalion with a wide range of 
frequencies ensure maintaining communications with the UHF 
radios of commanders of motorized rifle and tank subunits. 
  In addition, the artillery battalion commander and chief of 
staff and battery commanders must constantly maintain 
communications with the senior artillery commander (chief), 
subordinate commanders, and artillery reconnaissance subunits. 
  One of the battalion's radios periodically comes up on the 
meteorological support radio net in accordance with the schedule 
for meteorological message broadcast to receive meteorological 
data. 
  A variant of a battalion radio communications diagram is 
shown in Figure 7. 




    In organizing radio communications when there is a limited 
radio equipment available, it is advisable to set up radio nets 
with a larger number of command posts (of commanders), that is, 
shift from communications via radio links to communications via 
a radio net. 
  The artillery battalion command and observation post's 
landline communications with battery command and observation 
posts, the fire control post, and forward (lateral) observation 
posts are organized by links by the battalion's forces and 
assets. 
  Depending on the type of combat, the battalion's 
communications equipment is deployed by decision of the 
battalion commander at the location of the battalion command and 
observation post or fire control post. The battery command and 
observation posts and the battalion fire control post 
communicate with the gun platoons over lines laid by the forces 
and assets of the batteries. Landline communications between the 
artillery battalion command and control post and the maneuver 
battalion command and control post are accomplished via maneuver 
battalion and artillery battalion switchboards over a connecting 
line laid by the forces and assets of the artillery battalion. 
This makes it possible to have alternative communications links 
both in the interests of the maneuver battalion and in the 
interests of the artillery battalion. 
  A variant of a landline communications diagram is shown in 
Figure 8. 




    Organizing and maintaining stable communications in a combat 
situation are the most important duties of the artillery 
battalion commander and staff. The artillery battalion commander 
determines with whom and by what time to establish 
communications, taking into account the mission assigned. In 
combat, the artillery battalion commander must have constant and 
reliable communications with subordinate subunits, regardless of 
the location. 
  The chief of staff supervises communications in the 
artillery 
battalion; he is responsible for its timely organization and 
continuous command and control of battalion subunits. The 
artillery battalion signal officer directly organizes 
communications and is responsible for its stable operation in 
the battalion; the headquarters platoon commander does this in 
the battery. Based on the decision of the artillery battalion 
commander and the communications instructions from higher 
headquarters, the chief of staff issues instructions on 
organizing communications, in which he indicates the following: 
  --To the battalion signal officer: information on the enemy 
and the battalion's mission; the location of the command 
(observation) post of the senior artillery commander and the 
direction of its relocation; the locations of the command and 
observation posts of the artillery battalion, batteries, the 
combined-arms subunit, the attached (assigned for servicing) 
artillery reconnaissance subunit, and the battalion fire control 
post and battery fire positions; with whom, by what time, and by 
what means to establish communications; restrictions in the 
operation of radio and landline communications equipment and 
operating procedures of radio equipment; and measures for 
protecting communications from enemy electronic countermeasures. 
  --To the subunit commanders: with whom, by what time, and by 
what means to establish communications; the call signs of 
communications stations and officials; radio operating data and 
restrictions in the operation of radio and landline 
communications equipment; operating procedures of radio 
equipment; and the procedure and times for charging batteries. 
  During the course of combat operations, the chief of staff 
updates organization of battalion communications, taking into 
account situation changes and communications equipment losses. 
  The battalion signal officer must constantly know the 
battalion's combat mission, the locations of the command and 
observation posts of the artillery battalion, batteries, the 
senior artillery commander (chief), and the maneuver battalion 
(regiment) commander, the battalion fire control post (staff), 
and the battery fire platoons; promptly plan the organization of 
communications; task subordinates; supervise the deployment of 
communications equipment; ensure protection of radio 
communications against jamming; and monitor the work of 
personnel for observing secure command and control procedures, 
and the status and maintenance of communications equipment. 
<H5>  Checking the Readiness of Subunits </H5>
  One of the most important elements of the work of the 
artillery battalion commander and chief of staff and battery 
commander is checking the readiness of subunits for carrying out 
the assigned mission. This readiness check must be thoroughly 
thought out, conducted in a timely manner, and combined with 
practical assistance to subordinate commanders in carrying out 
the tasks facing them and in eliminating detected shortcomings. 
It is planned and accomplished both in the organization and in 
the course of combat operations and must contribute to the 
timely and precise execution of fire missions. 
  In accomplishing the readiness check, the artillery 
battalion 
commander checks the battery and headquarters platoon 
commanders' knowledge of the prearranged name designations of 
local features and reference points; the combat missions of 
combined-arms subunits, and battery fire missions; organization 
of reconnaissance in the battalion and batteries; preparation of 
the command and observation post for conducting reconnaissance 
and fire control at night; the drawing up and keeping up of the 
necessary combat documents; senior battery officers' knowledge 
of the fire missions; correctness of calculating computed firing 
data for assigned targets by comparing the data of the battalion 
chief of staff with the data of the batteries; the quality of 
technical and ballistic preparation, topogeodetic survey, 
engineer preparation and camouflage of fire positions; 
preparation of fire platoons to deliver fire at night and in 
conditions of limited visibility; provisions of ammunition, 
fuel, and other supplies; organization of communications, local 
security, and self-defense; and also knowledge of prearranged 
control, warning, and coordinating signals. 
  When checking the organization of local security and 
self-defense, the knowledge of personnel of warning signals and 
the practical actions of gun crews at these signals are checked. 
<H5>  Battalion Fire Control </H5>
  Fire engagement of the enemy is the basis of the artillery 
battalion's combat operations. Therefore, battalion fire control 
is one of the most important duties of the battalion commander 
and staff. 
  Battalion fire control must ensure timely engagement of 
targets with high effectiveness. It includes: receiving fire 
missions (selection of targets for engagement); clarifying fire 
missions and conditions for executing them; making decisions for 
executing fire missions; assigning fire missions to subunits and 
monitoring their execution. 
  The battalion commander uses the personnel of the command 
and 
observation post located in the command vehicle or on the 
terrain for fire control. The accommodation of personnel, 
instruments, and communications equipment of a command and 
observation post located on the terrain must be convenient, 
ensure a view of the forward terrain in the assigned 
reconnaissance zone to as great a depth as possible, and provide 
good camouflage. Command and observation posts can be situated 
in trenches, in tall trees, in bushes, in attics and on upper 
floors of industrial and residential buildings, and in other 
places. 
  When conducting mobile combat operations in the course of an 
offensive, in a meeting engagement, and when pursuing the enemy, 
battalion and battery command and observation posts and also the 
battalion forward command post are situated in vehicles, that 
is, the command and observation posts become mobile, which makes 
it possible to more reliably maintain continuous cooperation 
with the battalion (company), control fire, and preserve 
survivability. When the command and observation post is deployed 
on the terrain, a vehicle is positioned close to it in a natural 
or prepared shelter. A variant of positioning a battalion 
command and observation post on the terrain is shown in Figure 9. 




    The timeliness in preparation for firing, particularly 
unscheduled firing, is achieved by advance distribution of 
functional duties among the personnel of the command and 
observation post and battalion fire control post, commanders, 
and battery senior officers and plotters, and also by precise 
execution of these duties. 
  When controlling firing, the battalion (battery) commander 
must know the situation, the combat strength, position, supply 
status, and firing capabilities of subordinate subunits, the 
operating procedures and capabilities of automation equipment 
and other fire control, reconnaissance, and fire servicing 
equipment; personally conduct enemy reconnaissance, conduct 
registration fire, and monitor the course of combat and firing 
results; quickly accept (update) decisions for executing fire 
missions; in a timely manner assign fire missions to subordinate 
subunits, give commands (signals) to request (open), shift, and 
cease fire; monitor execution of fire missions; report to the 
senior commander (chief) on the execution of fire missions, the 
opening and ceasing of firing against targets, and ammunition 
expenditure; be ready, if necessary, to assume fire control of 
the artillery group (battalion) of which the battalion (battery) 
is a part; and take steps for immediate restoration of disrupted 
command and control. 
  Missions being carried out by artillery fire are called fire 
missions. They may be scheduled or unscheduled. 
  Scheduled fire mission--the target has been 
reconnoitered; target coordinates and size have been determined; 
the mission has been assigned to the batteries; and the settings 
for the target have been calculated and recorded in the tables 
of calculated settings and with the gun commanders. The nature 
of the target and ammunition expenditure may be updated before 
execution of the fire mission. 
  Unscheduled fire mission--the target has just been 
reconnoitered or was reconnoitered earlier, but has not been 
assigned to the battalion for engagement; the mission is 
assigned by the senior commander or the decision to execute it 
is made by the artillery battalion commander immediately before 
engagement of the target. 
  It is obvious from the conditions of executing these 
missions 
that the artillery battalion spends considerably less time on 
opening fire against a scheduled target than against an 
unscheduled target. 
  Timely engagement of targets in the interests of supporting 
combined-arms subunits in the course of combat is achieved by 
the speed of deployment of the battalion in an unprepared area 
and of preparing fires against the targets. 
  In making the decision for execution of an unscheduled fire 
mission, the artillery battalion commander selects the most 
important targets to engage for the success of the combat 
mission being carried out by the supported combined-arms 
subunit. Correct target selection and determination of the 
moment (time) for to begin its engagement are possible only with 
continuous monitoring of enemy and friendly troop operations. 
  In his decision, the artillery battalion commander specifies 
(clarifies): the targets (target), the objective of the firing, 
and the open (readiness) and cease-fire times; the number of 
batteries, platoons, or guns involved in firing on each target; 
the type of fire; the methods of fire; the shell, fuse, charge, 
and type of trajectory; the order of executing fire missions; 
the method of determining settings for firing for effect; the 
assets to be used for adjusting fire; shell expenditure; safety 
measures for friendly troops; and signals for requesting 
(opening), shifting, and ceasing fire. 
  The artillery battalion commander and staff check the 
readiness for executing fire missions and firing for effect. 
  When checking the readiness for executing fire missions, 
they 
check subordinates' knowledge of their fire missions and the 
order of executing them, the correctness of determining settings 
for firing for effect, and the designation of the method of 
firing on the targets. Checking firing for effect involves 
checking the timeliness of opening (shifting) fire, ending fire 
on a target, adjusting fire in the course of firing for effect, 
expenditure of the designated amount of shells, and 
determination of the results of firing for effect. 
<H5>  Chapter 3. Political Work in the Artillery Battalion </H5>
  The entire history and combat experience of the Soviet Armed 
Forces convincingly indicates that success in conducting combat 
operations depends decisively on the high political-moral state, 
psychological steadfastness, and combat skills of personnel. 
Political work plays a most important role in instilling these 
traits. 
  "...There is no laxity in the Army, its order and spirit is 
better, and there are more victories...where political work is 
conducted most importantly."[.sup]1[/] 
  Political work is a component part of preparing and 
conducting combat operations. In the combat situation, it aims 
at firm and consistent implementation of the policy of the 
Communist Party in the Armed Forces, strengthening the 
political-moral state and conscious discipline, skillful mastery 
of weapons and combat equipment, improving military proficiency 
of personnel, ensuring high combat readiness and combat 
effectiveness of the artillery battalion, and mobilization of 
artillerymen for successful execution of combat orders and 
missions. 
  A most important task of political work in the combat 
situation is educating personnel in a spirit of selfless 
devotion to their people, the motherland, the Communist Party 
and the Soviet Government, the cause of communism, allegiance to 
military duty, unshakable determination to carry out the 
assigned mission, and constant readiness to fight selflessly and 
give every effort, and one's life if necessary, for the sake of 
victory over the enemy. 
  The saturation of enemy combat formations with 
high-precision 
and mobile weapons, particularly antitank weapons, makes it 
necessary to hit them in short periods of time. It is advisable 
to engage these weapons with the fire of the entire artillery 
battalion. Therefore, in the process of political work it is 
necessary to instill a sense of each soldier's high 
responsibility for timely and accurate fire and for explicit 
execution of his duties. 
  Political work in the combat situation is distinguished by 
its diversity in content, form, and method. This obligates 
commanders, political workers, and the combat aktiv to 
constantly demonstrate initiative and creativity in ideological 
and educational work with personnel. 
  The experience of the Great Patriotic War is invaluable in 
organizing and conducting political work in a subunit in modern 
combat. The selfless courage of frontline artillerymen, among 
whom there were 1,885 Heroes of the Soviet Union and more than 
1.6 million orders and medals awarded, will always serve as an 
example for today's generation of artillerymen. Two 
artillerymen--V.S. Petrov and A.I. Shilin--earned the title Hero 
of the Soviet Union twice. 
  Progressive character and devotion to the socialist 
motherland and to the cause of communism were sources of mass 
heroism of Soviet soldiers during the Great Patriotic War. This 
was the result of continuous, purposeful political work in the 
combat situation. 
  Explaining to soldiers the nature and political goals of a 
war that may be imposed on the Soviet Union by the imperialist 
aggressors is of great importance. 
  "...Awareness by the masses of the goals and causes of war," 
pointed out V.I. Lenin, "is of tremendous importance and ensures 
victory."[.sup]2[/] 
  Fostering a burning hatred toward the enemies of socialism 
and communism in the soldiers, exposing the aggressive essence 
of imperialism, and struggling with bourgeois ideology develops 
in soldiers a deep confidence in the rightness of our great 
cause and in victory over the enemy. 
  Cultivating in artillerymen high readiness, vigilance, and 
responsibility for preserving military and state secrets remains 
a timely task of political work. 
  An important political task is propagandizing revolutionary 
and combat traditions, popularizing the heroic feats of Soviet 
soldiers and servicemen of fraternal socialist armies, and 
effectively using their experience in the combat situation that 
has taken shape. 
  Commanders, political workers, and combat aktiv of the 
artillery battalion must convey the assigned missions to all 
personnel, explain the methods of carrying them out, and rally 
soldiers to aggressive and decisive actions for effective 
engagement of enemy targets in any situation. 
  Modern combat places particularly high demands on officers. 
They must possess a firm will and the ability to assess the 
situation rapidly and correctly, control the subunit, and be 
masters of artillery firing. In party-political work with 
officers it is necessary to constantly increase their political 
awareness; cultivate a high party spirit, moral purity, and 
efficiency; develop initiative, creativity, and efficiency in 
combat work; develop professional competence; and arm them with 
progressive experience in commanding and educating soldiers in 
the combat situation. 
  Today, when radical transformations are taking place in 
military affairs, and the nature of combined-arms combat is 
changing, even greater demands are placed on officer personnel 
in command and control of subunits and in training and educating 
personnel. Special attention should be given to educating young 
officers who do not have sufficient practical experience, and 
officers called up from the reserves. 
  In conditions of modern, highly mobile combat, a most 
important task of political work is developing in soldiers a 
sense of military comradeship, mutual assistance, cohesiveness, 
and a profound understanding that only the joint precise and 
coordinated actions of all personnel of the gun crews, platoons, 
batteries, and the battalion as a whole can ensure successful 
accomplishment of the combat mission. 
  Political work to unit multinational, military collectives 
and create in them a healthy moral atmosphere and a great sense 
of friendship among soldiers of different nationalities acquires 
special significance. 
  The experience of the Great Patriotic War and large tactical 
exercises and maneuvers shows that the best results in the 
actions of artillerymen are achieved when there is a 
differentiated approach to individual work with servicemen of 
different specialties directly in the subunits. In work with 
scouts and plotters, it is necessary to pay attention to 
ensuring high fire accuracy, conducting aggressive 
reconnaissance in all types of combat activities, and achieving 
error-free actions when determining target coordinates and 
computed firing data and topogeodetic survey of fire positions 
and command and observation post sites. In work with gunners, 
attention should be given to being able to work quickly and 
without error on aiming devices and gun elevating and traversing 
mechanisms. 
  During the course of preparing for carrying out fire 
missions 
in the platoons and batteries, training sessions should be 
organized for combat activities and improving the 
interchangeability of crew members, since the success of combat 
of artillerymen depends on the high proficiency of each 
specialist and the collective actions of all personnel. 
  Preparing the personnel of artillery subunits for combating 
enemy tanks and destroying its antitank weapons, and fostering 
in soldiers faith in the strength and might of their weapons and 
their high combat capabilities is of exceptionally great 
importance in modern combat. 
  An important aspect in the work of commanders, political 
workers, and the combat aktiv is instilling in personnel a class 
hatred of the enemies of the Soviet motherland; exposing the 
anticommunist nature and ideology of imperialism, hostile 
propaganda, and ideological subversion; and maintaining in 
artillerymen the ability to withstand the enemy's ideological 
and psychological influence. 
  A special place in political work should be given to 
fostering psychological and moral steadfastness in combat and in 
combat operations when the enemy uses weapons of mass 
destruction. It must develop in personnel a firm conviction that 
reliable protection from these weapons is possible and that the 
combat mission must be carried out in any conditions. 
  Political work in a combat situation must show a fatherly 
concern for people, continuously provide subunits with 
everything needed for their combat activities (ammunition, 
food), satisfy in a timely manner the material and cultural 
needs of personnel, their rest, medical assistance for the 
wounded, and commendations for those distinguishing themselves 
in combat. 
  The severe reality of war, inevitably involving human 
losses, 
requires a careful approach to organizing the burial of soldiers 
who die in battles for the motherland. Paying last respects to 
those who die and their memory are a means of strengthening the 
morale of Soviet soldiers and mobilizing them for a decisive 
struggle with the enemy. 
  Successful accomplishment of the tasks of political work in 
the combat situation is achieved: 
  --By timely assignment of tasks for political work and 
thorough briefing of commanders, political workers, and the 
combat aktiv on the substance of their work in various 
conditions of combat situations; 
  --Proper assignment of party members and the combat aktiv; 
ensuring that communists and Komsomol members set a personal 
example in combat; increasing in every possible way the 
activeness and fighting spirit of party and Komsomol 
organizations; 
  --Constant communication by commanders and political workers 
with subordinates; a comprehensive and in-depth study of their 
moral-political and fighting qualities; knowledge of moods and 
needs; their continuous and active influence on subordinates, 
particularly in the most difficult moments of combat; 
  --Organizing continuous combat and political briefings of 
personnel during the course of combat operations; and 
propagandizing progressive combat experience. 
  One of the decisive conditions of the effectiveness of 
political work is the correct determination of its forms and 
methods, and their skillful combination and creative use in 
accordance with combat missions and the situation. Political 
work must be conducted continuously, effectively, purposefully, 
and all the more actively as the combat situation becomes more 
complex and intense. 
  It is difficult to use forms of political work involving all 
battalion personnel in the combat situation. When conducting 
combat operations, battalion personnel are spread out--at the 
fire positions, at battalion and battery command and observation 
posts, in command and staff command vehicles, and in support 
subunits. Personnel will be in individual protective gear when 
conducting combat operations on terrain with radioactive and 
chemical contamination. In these conditions, the main forms of 
political work are individual and group talks, briefings, 
reading of leaflets and appeals, publishing operational news 
sheets, reading pamphlets, holding short party and Komsomol 
meetings directly in the subunits, and extensive use of various 
technical means of propaganda, especially radio. 
  The artillery battalion (battery) commander bears full 
responsibility for political work, education, and the 
political-moral state and military discipline of personnel 
subordinate to him. He determines the main tasks of political 
work in upcoming combat operations and must be personally 
involved on a daily basis with political and military education 
of soldiers. In his practical work, the battalion commander must 
rely on party and Komsomol organizations and the combat aktiv, 
and direct their activities toward successful execution of 
assigned missions. 
  The battalion commander makes a decision based on a 
clarification of the combat mission received and the conclusions 
from the situation assessment. Simultaneously with making the 
decision, he determines the main tasks for political work and 
its special features. The battalion commander assigns the tasks 
for political work to the deputy battalion commander for 
political affairs. In doing so, he specifies: 
  --the particular features of the upcoming tasks and what 
must 
be explained to personnel; 
  --where to direct special attention in political work with 
soldiers in preparing for combat operations and during them; 
  --what basic political measures it is advisable to take and 
at what time in order to ensure accomplishment of the combat 
mission; 
  --the deadline for submitting the political work plan for 
approval. 
  Based on the battalion commander's decision and the 
instructions of the deputy regimental commander for political 
affairs, the deputy battalion commander for political affairs 
draws up a plan for political work with battalion personnel for 
the period of preparing for and conducting combat operations. 
The political work plan must be approved by the artillery 
battalion commander before he assigns combat missions to the 
battery commanders and their deputies for political affairs. 
  The measures of the plan for political work with personnel 
(Table 5) usually encompass two phases--preparations for combat 
operations and the battalion's combat operations.

Deputy Battalion Commander for Political Affairs (Signature, Rank) 

"Approved," Battalion Commander (Name, Rank), Date 


  The plan for political work with battalion personnel for the 
period of preparing for and conducting combat operation 
specifies the following: specific political work measures for 
ensuring execution of the combat mission, orders, and 
instructions of senior commanders and chiefs; disseminating 
missions to personnel; assigning political workers and the 
combat aktiv; briefing commanders and political workers on 
questions of organizing and conducting political work; 
organizing combat and political briefings for personnel; 
briefing the battalion and regimental command authorities on the 
political-moral state of personnel; providing subunits with 
newspapers, magazines, technical means of propaganda, and other 
materials; and, when necessary, participation of battalion 
subunits in disseminating agitation materials. 
  In a combat situation, the deputy battalion commander for 
political affairs will not always have enough time to compile a 
detailed political work plan. Therefore, the plan may be brief, 
but specific, and specify the main measures aimed at 
accomplishment of the combat mission. 
  In the instructions for organizing and conducting political 
work in the subunits, the artillery battalion commander 
emphasizes the requirements of documents of the party, the 
Soviet Government, and the command authority. These must be made 
the basis of political work in preparing personnel for combat 
operations; particular features of combat actions, typical 
difficulties, and ways of overcoming them; the procedure for 
explaining to personnel the combat mission and the goal of 
combat actions; categories of personnel and subunits to which 
political work should pay special attention, depending on their 
role in the combat operations; the scale of mass political 
measures and approximate times for conducting them; measures for 
material and technical support of the combat actions, to which 
commanders and political workers should give priority attention; 
procedure for restoring combat effectiveness of personnel in the 
event the enemy uses weapons of mass destruction; political 
measures for ensuring cooperation with supported subunits and 
times for conducting them; and the order and times of briefings 
on political work done and on the political-moral state of 
personnel. 
  After the artillery battalion commander issues instructions 
on organizing and conducting political work in the subunits, his 
deputy for political affairs informs subordinate officers of the 
content of the plan for political work with battalion personnel 
for the period of preparing for and conducting combat actions. 
He must personally task deputy battery commanders for political 
affairs, and provide them with the necessary materials for 
conducting political work with subunit personnel.

<H5>  Chapter 4. The Artillery Battalion in an Offensive Situation </H5>
<H5>  Battalion Missions </H5>
  The goal of offensive combat is the complete defeat of the 
opposing enemy and seizing of an important area or line. 
  The goal of an offensive in modern combined-arms combat can 
be achieved by effective fire engagement of the enemy by all 
available assets, by combining the efforts of all branches of 
troops and aviation, by a decisive attack, and by the swift 
advance of combined-arms subunits into the depth of the enemy's 
defenses. 
  An important and sometimes decisive role in achieving the 
goals of an offensive move belongs to the artillery. Firing at 
long ranges, firepower, and accuracy of fire enable artillery to 
engage the enemy by fire suddenly, both before an offensive and 
during the course of it. 
  Fire engagement means to deliver fire against objectives 
(targets) from various types of weapons with strikes by rocket 
forces and aviation using conventional ammunition, as a result 
of which the objectives completely or partially lose their 
combat effectiveness (their basic functions). 
  Artillery accomplishes fire engagement by periods: artillery 
preparation of an attack, artillery support of an attack, and 
artillery accompaniment of a troop offensive in depth. The 
existence of these periods of fire engagement is caused 
primarily by the goals and uniqueness of the missions being 
carried out by artillery in each period, the difference in the 
methods of carrying them out, and the nature of the maneuver by 
artillery during the course of combat operations. At the same 
time, artillery carries out missions in support of the advance 
of units at a high tempo in each of the periods. 
  Artillery preparation for an attack immediately 
precedes the attack by motorized rifle and tank subunits and is 
conducted to the depth of enemy first-echelon units, and to the 
depth of effective fire against the most important targets and 
objectives. Its duration and configuration are determined by the 
concept of operations. As a rule, it consists of several 
shellings. 
  During artillery preparation of the attack, the artillery 
battalion may engage offensive tactical nuclear and chemical 
weapons; neutralize artillery batteries, mortar platoons, strong 
points (at the forward-most defensive positions and in the 
immediate depth), and command posts; destroy antitank weapons at 
and between company strong points, electronic assets, and other 
enemy assets. The battalion carries out these missions by 
concentrated fire and by fire at single targets. 
  Artillery preparation for an attack begins with a surprise 
powerful shelling by all artillery against planned targets and 
primarily against personnel and weapons at the forward-most 
defensive positions, artillery batteries, and other important 
targets. Direct-fire weapons destroy tanks, armored personnel 
carries, ATGM [antitank guided missile] launchers, and guns, and 
also destroy enemy emplacements. Artillery preparation ends at 
the established time with a shelling of first-echelon company 
strong points and antitank weapons outside of strong points when 
first-echelon motorized rifle and tank subunits reach the final 
coordination line. The last shelling against artillery 
batteries and mortar platoons usually begins before the end of 
artillery preparation and overlaps the time of the attack on the 
enemy's forward-most defensive positions. 
  Artillery support of an attack begins when 
first-echelon subunits begin moving from the final coordination 
line and continues nonstop until they seize the defensive areas 
of the enemy's first-echelon battalions and is conducted to a 
great depth. Participating in conducting a successive fire 
concentration or a rolling barrage, the artillery battalion 
neutralizes earlier reconnoitered strong points, antitank 
weapons, and command posts in front and on the flanks of 
attacking subunits. A battalion (battery) not being used in a 
successive fire concentration, or rolling barrage, neutralizes 
newly detected targets whose fire is impeding the advance of 
attacking subunits. A battalion may also be used to neutralize 
newly detected offensive nuclear and chemical weapons, artillery 
batteries, and mortar platoons. With the start of artillery 
support of the attack, guns and tanks assigned for direct firing 
and ATGM launchers play an important role in destroying 
surviving targets at the forward-most defensive positions and in 
the immediate depth. 
  Artillery accompaniment of a deep troop offensive 
is accomplished for the purpose of continuous fire engagement of 
the enemy as the offensive moves deep in the enemy's defenses. 
It begins after artillery support of the attack ends and 
continues until the attacking subunits have carried out their 
combat missions. 
  During this period the battalion may engage newly detected 
offensive tactical nuclear and chemical weapons and neutralize 
artillery batteries, personnel, and weapons offering resistance 
to the attacking first-echelon subunits. 
  In the course of artillery accompaniment, the battalion may 
also participate in carrying out missions to support the 
commitment of second echelons, repel counterattacks by enemy 
reserves, support subunits crossing water obstacles, and prevent 
the enemy from consolidating on favorable lines. In addition, 
the battalion may be used to engage targets when supporting a 
tactical airborne assault. 
  During this period the battalion most often has to carry out 
unscheduled fire missions assigned by the senior artillery 
commander, maneuver battalion (regiment) commander, and also at 
the decision of the artillery battalion commander. The artillery 
battalion and batteries will use engagement of single targets, 
concentrated fire, or barrage fire, and may also be used for 
massing fire according to the plan of the senior artillery 
commander (chief). 
  The depth of the combat operations during this period and 
the 
need for timely opening of fire to neutralize reconnoitered 
targets to support the advance of tank and motorized rifle 
subunits will require repeated relocation of the artillery 
battalion. Taking into account the extent of enemy resistance, 
the nature of actions of our subunits, and the artillery 
battalion's place in the artillery grouping, the artillery 
battalion may relocate at full strength or by batteries. 
<H5>  Preparation for Combat Operations </H5>
  Depending on the situation, a maneuver battalion's attack 
against a defending enemy may be accomplished on the move with 
subunits moving up from the attack position or from a position 
of direct contact with the enemy. It usually begins with a 
breakthrough, which involves softening up the enemy defenses by 
strikes from all types of weapons and a swift assault by tank 
and motorized rifle subunits, with subsequent development of the 
actions deep and to the flanks. 
  An attack on the move by a maneuver battalion against a 
defending enemy is usually accomplished from the attack 
position. Preparation of the attacking subunits for combat 
operations in these conditions is usually accomplished under the 
cover of the subunits defending in direct contact with the 
enemy. It is usually done on the terrain, secretly, and over 
short time periods. In the attack position, the artillery 
battalion is disposed by batteries in a formation that ensures 
rapid and organized movement to the assigned fire position area. 
Terrain folds and other natural and manmade shelters are used to 
accommodate combat equipment, motor transport, and personnel. 
Before moving out to the fire position area, they organize local 
security and self-defense; engineer preparation and camouflage; 
preparation of armament, equipment, and personnel for the 
upcoming combat operations; and replenishment of supplies. 
  At the attack position, the artillery battalion commander 
receives the mission usually according to a map, with subsequent 
update of the mission on the terrain. A variant of the sequence 
of the artillery battalion commander's work to prepare the 
battalion's combat operations in these conditions is shown in 
Figure 10. 




    The artillery battalion commander and staff organize the 
receipt and updating of information on the enemy from artillery 
and combined-arms subunits operating in direct contact with the 
enemy in the course of commander's reconnaissance. Command and 
observation posts of the artillery battalion and all batteries 
are deployed for reconnaissance of the enemy in the artillery 
battalion assigned to support the maneuver battalion. An 
artillery reconnaissance group is dispatched for reconnaissance, 
topogeodetic survey, and engineer preparation of fire positions 
and command and observation post sites. The artillery battalion 
withdraws from the attack position to the fire position area and 
deploys into the battle formation at the time established by the 
senior artillery commander, usually at night or in other 
conditions of limited visibility. 
  The maneuver battalion's attack on the move can also be 
accomplished directly from the line of march. This usually takes 
place when developing combat operations deep, when the enemy 
strives to delay our units' advance by a defense on favorable 
lines. The artillery battalion may move as part of a forward 
detachment or advance guard, behind the advance guard, or in the 
main-force column. Artillery reconnaissance subunits of a 
battalion attached to a forward detachment or advance guard move 
with the advance party, and those of a battalion moving behind 
the forward detachment (advance guard) and at the head of the 
main forces move in the main-force column of the advance guard. 
  The artillery battalion commander makes a decision and, 
using 
a map, tasks the batteries during the approach to the enemy 
defenses. With the battalion's arrival at the fire position area 
and deployment of the command and observation posts, the 
battalion commander updates the missions to the batteries on the 
terrain by separate instructions and commands. Formalized 
documents (tables, diagrams) are widely used to reduce the time 
for planning and disseminating missions. The command and 
observation posts of an artillery battalion operating as part of 
an advance guard (forward detachment) or assigned to support a 
first-echelon maneuver battalion deploy jointly with the 
maneuver battalion's command and observation posts. 
  The maneuvering battalion's offensive against a defending 
enemy is accomplished in the battle formation set up earlier 
after the necessary regrouping from the defense, and sometimes 
with troops advancing replacing defending subunits. 
  In such conditions, the artillery battalion commander 
conducts all the work for organizing combat operations on the 
terrain. Depending on where the breakthrough sector is planned, 
the artillery battalion may remain at the fire positions, which 
makes it considerably easier to prepare for combat operations, 
or it may relocate to a new area. The artillery battalion may be 
moved up to fire positions; in this case, the move up and 
deployment into battle formation are accomplished at night or in 
other conditions of limited visibility. 
  Let us follow the preparation of an artillery battalion's 
combat operations in a tactical example in which it is part of a 
regimental artillery group and assigned to support a 
first-echelon battalion attacking without a halt from the attack 
position. The sequence and substance of the work of the 
artillery battalion commander and staff in this example should 
be considered as one of possible variants. The tactical example 
shows how the commander and the chief of staff resolve the most 
important issues.

<H6>  Initial Tactical Situation (Map, Figure 11) </H6>




    The 2d Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment [AR], arrived by 
rail at Kovni Station (not on map). During the course of 
off-loading, the artillery battalion commander received the 
following field instruction from the commander of the 8th 
Artillery Regiment: 
  "1. The enemy has halted the advance of our troops at an 
earlier prepared line 100-110 km west of Kovni Station. His air 
support is conducting aggressive reconnaissance, and small 
groups of aircraft are making bomb strikes using incendiary 
weapons. Operations by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance parties 
have been noted in our troop dispositions. 
  "2. The artillery battalion is to execute a march over the 
route Kryuki, Beloye, Pletni (not on map), and by 2300 hours 12 
October concentrate in the area of Hill 61.2, (exc.) Butki, the 
grove. The head of the artillery battalion column is to pass the 
starting point, the western outskirts of Golevo, at 2030 hours. 
  "The 1st and 3d artillery battalions are located in areas... 
(indicated on map); the command and observation post [COP] of 
the 8th Artillery Regiment... (indicated on the map). 
  "Communications by radio are forbidden before the start of 
combat operations. 
  "3. Signals: 
  "--radioactive contamination--`Radiation Danger'; 
  "--chemical and bacteriological (biological) 
contamination--`Chemical Alert,' chemical alert signal flares; 
  "--enemy air attack--`Air,' green signal flares; 
  "--enemy ground attack--`Motorized Infantry,' `Tanks'; 
  "--deploy into battle formation from the line of 
march--`Lafet'; 
  "--continue movement--`Motor.'" 
  Based on the instruction received, the artillery battalion 
commander dispatched an artillery reconnaissance group (ARG) for 
reconnaissance of the assigned area and gave tasks to the 
subunit commanders for executing the march. The artillery 
battalion passed the starting point at the indicated time and 
continued to execute the march. 
  When approaching the designated area at 2255 hours 16 
October, the ARG chief met the battalion commander and reported 
on reconnaissance of the area and the planned sites for the 
subunits. The battalion commander marked these places on his 
work map, approved the ARG chief's report, and issued the 
following combat order to the subunits: 
  "1. The enemy is located in the western sector at a distance 
of 25-30 km. His air support is conducting active reconnaissance 
of our units' dispositions and is making bomb strikes 
periodically with small groups of aircraft. 
  "2. We arrived at the battalion's designated disposition 
area. 
  "3. Subunits are to occupy the following places: 4th 
Battery..., 5th Battery..., 6th Battery..., battalion staff and 
support subunits... (indicated on map). Position combat 
equipment and motor transport secretly, using terrain 
irregularities. Dig slit trenches at each gun for sheltering the 
crews. 
  "4. Organize local security in each subunit to prevent 
penetration by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance parties and 
organize self-defense to repel a possible attack by them. 
  "5. Dangerous sectors are... (shown on the terrain). 
Organize 
patrols in these sectors, assigning two patrols from the 5th 
Battery. The chief of staff will assign missions. 
  "6. Warning signals are as previously indicated. Password is 
`Machinegun'; reply is `Poltava.' 
  "7. By 2330 hours 16 October the chief of staff is to 
organize landline communications between the battalion staff and 
each subunit, compile a local security and self-defense diagram 
for the battalion, and prepare an action report." 
  At 2345 hours 16 October, the chief of staff reported to the 
artillery battalion commander on the documents he had drawn up. 
  Only the action report is given here.

18 October. 
  "Perform topogeodetic survey by map using the navigation 
instruments of the command vehicle; determine the grid azimuths 
of the reference points using the gyroscopic method by 1200 
hours 17 October. 
  "The battalion will be supplied ammunition in the fire 
position area in the amount of 2.5 units of fire by 2100 hours 
17 October. Arrange to meet the transport at the crossroads 
(1963). 
  "5. Conduct technical preparations in the occupied areas 
using subunit forces before 1800 hours 17 October. 
  "6. Conduct calibration firing of the new batches of charges 
using the battalion's reference piece from a temporary fire 
position of one of the batteries of the 19th Regimental 
Artillery Group using ABS from 1700 to 1830 hours 17 October and 
from 0500 to 0600 hours 18 October. 
  "7. Have the following supplies: 1.2 fuelings of fuel with 
the vehicles; a fuel tanker will arrive at the battalion by 1300 
hours 17 October; rations should be according to troop norms. 
  "The regiment's rear subunits are at the western edge of the

commander of the 1st Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment, 
does so from 1330 to 1430 hours 17 October." 
  Based on a study of the warning order, the artillery 
battalion commander determined the following measures which had 
to be carried out immediately: 
  --summon to the battalion staff the battery commanders, the 
senior officer of the 5th Battery (chief of the ARG), motor 
transport equipment, artillery equipment, and the commander of 
the administrative section; 
  --issue instructions for carrying out the 8th Artillery 
Regiment commander's warning order; 
  --arrange to feed personnel before 0600. 
  Next the commander and chief of staff synchronize timing 
(Table 6) for preparing the battalion for combat operations and 
prepare to issue a warning order to subunit commanders. 


Table 6. Timing. It is now 0500 hours 17 October. Readiness to open fire is at 
0630 hours 18 October. Total time available for preparing the battalion is 25 
hours 30 minutes, with 11 hours of daylight.

  Guided by the map, the artillery battalion commander 
performed an assessment of the terrain in order to make a sound 
allocation of the assigned fire position area among the 
batteries. 
  Terrain Assessment. The route of movement to the 
fire position area runs through a large wooded area. The route 
has two bridges across small streams, the capacity of which is 
difficult to ascertain. The fire position area, considering its 
size, makes it possible to disperse the batteries. The nature of 
the terrain is semibroken. There are no swampy areas, which 
will make it possible to perform the engineering preparation of 
the fire positions. All this will increase the survivability of 
subunits. A dirt road runs through the fire position area, which 
will ensure the battalion rapid deployment into battle formation 
at night. The most convenient places for the fire positions may 
be: 4th Battery--the area 200-250 meters south of Hill 83.0; 5th 
Battery--the area of the brush; 6th Battery--the area of the 
single tree. 
  The developed geodetic network makes it possible to perform 
topogeodetic survey of the fire positions accurately and in a 
short time. 
  To conduct reconnaissance to as great a depth as possible, 
it 
is advisable to select sites for the command and observation 
posts on the line of the second trench of our defending 
subunits: 4th Battery--on Hill Bob; 6th Battery--on the 
southwestern slopes of Hill 88.0; 5th Battery and the 
battalion--on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0. 
  At 0515 hours 17 October, the battalion commander assembled 
the subunit commanders and ordered the chief of staff to issue 
them topographic maps, after which he gave instructions on 
preparing for combat operations: 
  "The enemy has been taking up a defensive position with 
subunits of the 4th Brigade since 1610 hours with the forward 
edge running from Hill 90.3, the dairy farm, and further to the 
south. 
  "The position of brigade reserves is on a line running from 
the group of trees, the single houses, and mound 3. 
  "The 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment is preparing to go over to 
the offensive from the staging area. The 2d Battalion, 8th 
Artillery Regiment, is part of the 5th RAG and assigned to 
support the offensive of the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion. 
  "The chief of reconnaissance is to organize and conduct 
reconnaissance in the following area: on the right--Hill Bob and 
the height from Hill 92.0; on the left--the southern slopes of 
Hill 88.0, mound 3. 
  "The mission of reconnaissance is: 
  "--prior to the start of the offensive: determine the 
location of strong points and the nature of fortifications and 
artificial obstacles; reconnoiter other targets and determine 
their coordinates, such as weapons (especially antitank weapons) 
and also command posts and mortar platoons in the vicinity of 
the road junction and 500 meters to the south. 
  "Additional missions will be indicated during the course of 
the offensive. 
  "Deploy the command and observation posts as follows: the 
battalion and 5th Battery--on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0; 
4th Battery--on Hill Bob; 6th Battery--on the southwestern 
slopes of Hill 88.0; deploy the SNAR radar attached to the 
battalion in the vicinity of Hill 88.0. 
  "Receive reconnaissance information from the commander of 
the 
1st Artillery Battalion. The battalion is deployed in the 
defenses of the 19th Motorized Rifle Regiment in direct contact 
with the enemy. The command and observation post of the 1st 
Artillery Battalion is on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0. 
  "Number the targets as follows: artillery batteries and 
mortar platoons--20-30; other targets--60-80. 
  "Present reconnaissance information to the group observation 
post: present the first information by 1200 hours, and 
subsequently every hour. The reconnaissance subunits are to 
depart the western outskirts of Peski at 0600 hours 17 Oct under 
the leadership of the regimental chief of intelligence. 
  "An artillery reconnaissance group is being dispatched from 
the battalion for reconnaissance and preparation of the fire 
position area. It is comprised of the chief of the ARG, the 
senior officer from the 5th Battery, gun platoon commanders of 
4th and 6th batteries, and two gun-crew members from each 
battery with instruments and equipment for topogeodetic survey, 
for conducting radiation and chemical reconnaissance, and for 
checking terrain for mines. 
  "The fire position area is Hill 83.0, the single tree, the 
brush. Select the battery fire positions as follows: 4th 
Battery--in the vicinity of Hill 83.0; 5th Battery--in the 
vicinity of the brush; 6th Battery--in the vicinity of the 
single tree. 
  "The fire positions should provide a minimum firing range of 
2500 meters. 
  "Select and prepare one fire position for each battery; 
clear 
out the field of fire; prepare gun emplacements, ammunition 
pits, and slit trenches for personnel; and prepare access 
routes. Clear the fire positions of highly inflammable ground 
objects for protection against enemy incendiary weapons. Perform 
engineer preparation and camouflage under camouflage nets and 
complete this work by 0600 hours 18 Oct. 
  "Prepare a site in the vicinity of the 5th Battery's fire 
position for the battalion fire control post. 
  "The base line of fire is grid azimuth 43-00. 
  "Perform a topogeodetic survey of the fire positions, by 
map, 
using the navigation equipment of the command vehicle, and 
determine the grid azimuths of bearings to aiming points by the 
gyroscopic method by 1200 hours 17 October. 
  "To ensure the topogeodetic survey and its monitoring, the 
orientation transmission post is deployed at Elevation 79.4 from 
0600 to 1100 hours 18 October. The callsign is "Gamma"; the main 
frequency is 29300 kHz, and the alternate is 32500 kHz. 
Operating procedures are the first 10 minutes of every half-hour. 
  "The ARG under the deputy commander of the 8th Artillery 
Regiment is to depart the western outskirts of Peski at 0620 
hours. 
  "Report the results of the work to me upon arrival at the 
fire position area. 
  "Battery commanders are to assign 20 people from each 
battery 
for engineer preparation of the fire positions and one motor 
vehicle from each battery to transport them. They will proceed 
with the ARG chief; organize preparation of equipment, prime 
movers, instruments, and ammunition. 
  "Technical preparation of guns, command vehicles, and 
instruments is to be performed from 0600 to 1800 hours 17 
October in the staging area; inspect the guns' sighting devices 
and recoil mechanisms and inspect instruments for calculation of 
ballistic range correction. 
  "Perform calibration firing of the lots of propellant 
charges 
delivered using the reference piece from a temporary fire 
position of one of the batteries of the 19th RAG using ABS from 
1700 to 1830 hours 17 October and from 0500 to 0530 hours 18 
October. Submit the results of the calibration firing to the 
battalion staff after they have been processed. The chief of 
staff and senior officer of the 5th Battery are responsible for 
the calibration firing. 
  "Sort and distribute ammunition among the batteries before 
0300 hours 18 October; measure the propellant temperature and 
report to the battalion staff every 2 hours, beginning at 0200 
hours 18 October. 
  "The chief of staff is to compile a work plan for carrying 
out these measures and for conducting calculation of ballistic 
range correction and technical preparation; establish the 
equipment operating time in the batteries to provide assistance; 
submit requisition for work to be done by forces of the 
regimental artillery workshop; monitor the work being performed 
in all batteries. When the battalion arrives at the fire 
position area, report to me on the accomplishment of measures 
for technical preparation and calculation of ballistic range 
correction. 
  "The artillery battalion will be issued ammunition at the 
fire position area in the amount of 2.5 basic loads by 2100 
hours 17 October. The commander of the 5th Battery is to arrange 
to meet the transport at the crossroads (1963) and to unload 
them the battery fire positions. Have a fuel reserve of 1.2 
fillings with the vehicles; the fuel tanker will arrive at the 
battalion by 1300 hours 17 October. Have the standard unit-level 
supply of food rations. The regiment's rear services subunits 
are at the western edge of the forest (1768). The signal officer 
is to prepare the signal squad to proceed to the fire position 
area and lay communications lines according to additional

<H5>  Receipt and Clarification of Mission </H5>
  The artillery battalion commander arrived at the command 
post 
of the 8th Artillery Regiment by 0730 hours 17 October, where he 
heard the operation order of the 5th RAG commander and the 
following was clarified: 
  1. The enemy was defending with subunits of the 4th Brigade 
on a prepared line with the forward edge running: trig point 
90.3, dairy farm, and further to the south. 
  Strong points of the first-echelon companies and other 
targets had been reconnoitered (see map). 
  The position of brigade reserves had been prepared on the 
line running: the group of trees, the single house (see map). 
Brigade reserves of up to a tank battalion of a tank group 
[tbtgr] are in the following area: (exc.) Borki, Hill 
Figurnaya, Belino. 
  2. The 2d Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, is part of the 
5th RAG and is assigned to support the 1st Battalion, 5th 
Motorized Rifle Regiment, which is attacking in the regiment's 
first echelon. A battalion of the adjacent regiment is attacking 
on the right, and the 2d Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle 
Regiment, is attacking on the left. 
  The boundaries with them are shown on the map. 
  The artillery battalion's missions are: 
  --during artillery preparation of the assault lasting 50 
minutes (from H-hour -:57 to H-hour -:07) neutralize: in the 
first shelling (15 minutes) on the signal "Buran" target 114, 
expenditure 540; in the third shelling (11 minutes) on the 
signal "Tayfun" target 66, expenditure 324; in the fourth 
shelling (14 minutes) on signal "Dozhd" target 114, expenditure 
324; 
  --during artillery support of the assault: support the 
assault during breakthrough of the first position with a 
successive fire concentration along two lines: No 1--target 114, 
expenditure 72; No 2--target 223, expenditure 255; 
  --during exploitation of the assault between the first and 
second positions: be ready to repel a possible counterattack by 
brigade reserves during their movement forward and 
deployment--target 174, with a fixed barrage in depth [GNZO] 
"Pikhta-2"; 
  --during breakthrough of the brigade reserves' position, 
support the assault with a successive fire concentration along 
two lines: No 1--target 444, expenditure 408; No 2--target 548, 
expenditure 192; 
  --with commitment of the regiment's second echelon, support 
the 3d Motorized Rifle Battalion; 
  --during artillery accompaniment of the troops' advance in 
the depth: when repelling the counterattack by division 
reserves, be ready to deliver massed fire "Mars-1," concentrated 
fire against target 601, and fixed barrage "Akatsiya." 
  The fire position area assigned to the artillery battalion 
is 
to be occupied by 0430 hours 18 October. 
  Relocation of the artillery battalion is to be accomplished 
at full strength: the first relocation, after the 1st Motorized 
Rifle Battalion seizes the first-echelon company strong points, 
is to fire position area No 2 (see map); the second, when 
subunits of the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion reach the line 
Hill 75.0, mound 3, is to fire position area No 3 (see map). The 
relocation route is the road junction, bridge, Borki. Begin 
relocation on signal "Motor." 
  Ammunition expenditure for the day is 3.5 units of fire, 
including: 
  --1.1 for artillery preparation of the assault; 
  --1.5 for artillery support of the assault; 
  --0.9 for artillery accompaniment of the deep troop advance. 
  Readiness to open fire is at 0630 hours 18 October. 
  The observation post of the 5th RAG at 1200 hours 17 October 
is to be 1.5 km west of the ravine; the command post is to be at 
the ravine at 0400 hours 18 October. The line of relocation is 
the dairy farm, mound 3, and the single grove. 
  In the event the observation post and command post of the 
5th 
RAG are disabled, command and control of the group is to be 
transferred to the commander of the 3d Artillery Battalion. The 
signal for assumption of command and control is "Zvezdochet." 
  The commander of the 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment is to 
conduct commander's reconnaissance and organize cooperation 
beginning at 1030 hours; the commander of the 5th RAG is to do 
so beginning at 1230 hours 17 October. Departure for the fire 
position area together with the commander of the 5th RAG is at 
0945 hours 17 October from the starting point of Peski. 
<H5>  Situation Assessment </H5>
  At 0810 hours 17 October, at the command post of the 8th 
Artillery Regiment the artillery battalion commander plotted the 
necessary data about the enemy on his work map from the 5th RAG 
commander's map, after which he left for the artillery 
battalion's dispositions. During the course of movement and on 
arrival at the battalion, he assessed the situation, worked up a 
decision, and prepared a report for the commander of the 1st 
Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment. 
  The Enemy. The 4th Brigade occupies a deliberate 
defense, the forward-most edge of which runs along the eastern 
slopes of Hill 90.3, the nameless height at the road, the dairy 
farm, and further to the south. 
  In the zone of upcoming operations, motorized infantry 
subunits reinforced by tanks are defending in the first 
position. Immediately in front of the advance of the 1st 
Motorized Rifle Battalion, two motorized infantry platoons are 
defending on the forward edge, and behind them up to a platoon 
deep. The defense area of the second-echelon company of the 
battalion is assumed to be the single grove, the cutting on the 
road, and pit four. 
  The brigade reserves' position has been prepared on a line 
with the group of trees, the single house, and Zbori. Deep in 
the defenses behind the second position in the vicinity of the 
single grove, Belino, and "Figurnaya" grove, a tank group tank 
battalion is located which may be used to conduct a 
counterattack from the line of the precipice, Zbori in the 
direction of mound three, and the road junction. 
  Company and platoon strong points have been prepared by 
engineers and are prepared for all-around defense. 
  The dispositions of individual targets, particularly 
antitank 
weapons, in the strong points (targets 114 and 223) have not 
been completely reconnoitered. The dispositions of reserves and 
artillery, engineer preparation, and the nature of the terrain 
makes it possible to believe that the 4th Brigade is 
concentrating its main efforts on the axes: the grove, the dairy 
farm and mound three, the single grove. 
  Conclusions. The enemy's defenses have been 
prepared in advance, and at this time the dispositions of 
weapons have not been disclosed fully enough. Available 
reconnaissance information makes it possible to neutralize 
assigned targets (strong points) with the battalion's 
concentrated fire by overlapping the fire of the batteries. It 
is necessary to focus the artillery battalion's reconnaissance 
assets on clarifying the boundaries of the platoon strong points 
and on follow-up reconnaissance of the dispositions of 
individual targets, particularly antitank weapons in the strong 
points (targets 114 and 223) and also between strong points. 
  Friendly Subunits. The 1st Motorized Rifle 
Regiment is advancing in the regiment's first echelon in the 
direction of Hill 88.0, the single house. During the course of 
the fighting, it is assigned combat missions to defeat 
first-echelon subunits of the battalion, repel counterattacks by 
enemy brigade reserves, and break through the position of the 
enemy brigade reserves on the move. 
  The artillery battalion is assigned to support the 1st 
Motorized Rifle Battalion and is at full strength in personnel, 
equipment, prime movers and motor transport, instruments, 
communications equipment, and personal weapons. The artillery 
battalion is tasked to neutralize two platoon strong points 
during the artillery preparation of the assault--targets 114 and 
66--for which 1.1 units of fire (1,188 shells) have been 
allocated; during the artillery support of the assault, it is to 
neutralize four platoon strong points--targets 114, 223, 444, 
and 548--for which 0.85 units of fire (927 shells) have been 
allocated, with a total of 1.5 units of fire (1,620 shells) 
allocated for this period. 
  Conclusions. The artillery battalion will deliver 
fire for 40 minutes of the artillery preparation and for 20 
minutes of the artillery support of the assault (40 minutes + 20 
minutes = one hour), and during this time each gun will expend 
66 + 18 = 84 shells. According to the fire chart, the battalion 
can carry out these missions using any of the propellant 
charges. For convenience of fire control and calculation of 
firing data, the second propellant charge is considered the 
common charge. 
  In view of the quite limited time for preparing a large 
amount of ammunition in conditions of darkness, prepare in 
advance work areas at each battery fire position and distribute 
personnel. 
  Refuel motor transport to established norms. 
  Terrain. In the zone of the upcoming offensive, 
the terrain is semibroken. From the planned sites for deployment 
of the observation posts it is possible to conduct observation 
using optical reconnaissance devices to a depth of 2.5-3.5 km, 
that is, to the depth of the first position. Areas of poor 
visibility are created on individual sectors having heights; 
therefore, it is necessary to use lateral observation posts. 
  Areas of fire position Nos two and three, planned for 
relocation of the battalion during the course of the offensive, 
can accommodate the batteries. The existing dirt road that 
passes through the fire position area provides for rapid 
movement of subunits. It is necessary to organize reconnaissance 
of the terrain in the batteries' fire position areas for the 
presence of mines. 
  Radiation and Chemical Situation. In previous 
battles, the enemy did not use weapons of mass destruction, and 
there is no information that he is preparing to use them. 
However, the enemy may at any time switch to combat operations 
using these weapons, particularly when our troops start moving 
up from the staging areas. It is necessary to assign the 
following tasks: 
  --for systematic conduct of radiation, chemical, and 
bacteriological (biological) reconnaissance: when preparing for 
the offensive--in the staging area, on the route of movement, 
and in the fire position area; in the course of the 
offensive--on relocation routes and in new fire position areas; 
  --for carrying out measures to organize protection against 
weapons of mass destruction, to check the availability and 
working condition of protective gear, to prepare teams to 
neutralize the effects of these weapons, and to conduct 
radiological and chemical monitoring. 
<H5>  Artillery Battalion Commander's Decision </H5>
  At 0840 hours 17 October, at the headquarters the artillery 
battalion commander announced his decision to the chief of 
staff, deputy battalion commander for political affairs, and the 
battery commanders: 
  "1. To support the companies of the 1st Battalion, 5th 
Motorized Rifle Regiment, assign the following: 
  "--the 4th Battery is to support the right-flank company; 
the 
6th Battery is to support the left-flank company; and the 5th 
Battery is to be the standby. 
  "2. Fire missions for the batteries and the order of their 
accomplishment: 
  "--during the artillery preparation of the assault--50 
minutes (from H-hour -:57 to H-hour -:07): 
  "--in the first shelling (15 minutes), neutralize target 114 
with three overlapping batteries; 
  "--in the second shelling (10 minutes), destroy targets by 
direct firing, batteries will not deliver fire; 
  "--in the third shelling (11 minutes), neutralize target 66 
with three overlapping batteries; 
  "--in the fourth shelling (14 minutes), neutralize target 
114 
with three overlapping batteries. 
  "--during the artillery preparation of the assault (from 
H-hour -:07): when breaking through the first position, with 
successive fire concentration along two lines--number one is to 
neutralize target 114 by two overlapping batteries and one 
battery ready to hit newly detected targets; number two is to 
neutralize target 223 with three overlapping batteries; be ready 
to neutralize target 174 with concentrated fire by three 
overlapping batteries and to deliver a deep fixed barrage 
`Pikhta-2'"; 
  "--neutralize target 444 (17 minutes) and target 548 (eight 
minutes) with concentrated fire by three overlapping batteries. 
  "The established expenditure of shells for each target is to 
be distributed among the batteries according to the number of 
gun-mounts. 
  "3. Prepare the battery fire positions in accordance with 
the 
warning order. 
  "4. Deploy the artillery battalion and battery command and 
observation posts by 1630 hours 17 October, and the artillery 
battalion fire control post by 0430 hours 18 October. The 
battery command and observation posts are to be positioned 
together with those of the supported companies, and the 
artillery battalion command and observation post together with 
that of the 1st Battalion, 5th Motorized Rifle Regiment. 
  "5. Readiness for landline communications is 1700 hours 17 
October. 
  "The commander of the 6th Battery is to assume command and 
control of the artillery battalion in the event the battalion 
command and observation post is disabled. The signal for 
assuming command and control is `Zvezda.'" 
<H3>  Artillery Battalion Commander's Instructions on Combat 
Support </H3>
  Protection Against Weapons of Mass Destruction. 
"The enemy has not used weapons of mass destruction in previous 
battles. However, he may at any time switch to combat operations 
using them, particularly at the start and during the course of 
movement of our troops from the staging area. 
  "Concentrate the main efforts of radiation, chemical, and 
bacteriological (biological) reconnaissance: during preparation 
of the offensive--in the staging area, on the route of movement, 
and in the fire position area; during the course of the 
offensive--on relocation routes and in the new fire position 
areas. 
  "The chief of staff is to clarify the location of the 
decontamination station and the military technical equipment 
depot and organize the replenishment or replacement of 
unserviceable protective gear in the subunits. Create in the 
battalion, ready at request, a team to neutralize the effects of 
the use of weapons of mass destruction. It is to consist of one 
platoon from each battery in two motor vehicles, a radiological 
monitoring instructor with instruments, a paramedic, and an 
automotive repair shop. 
  "Before 1800 hours 17 October battery commanders are to 
organize a check on the availability and condition of the 
individual protective gear of personnel. Shortages are to be 
replenished, and unserviceable gear is to be replaced. Report 
information on the enemy's use of weapons of mass destruction 
immediately, and report radiation doses received daily by 1800 
hours. 
  "Each battery is to prepare a firefighting team, made up of 
a 
crew with firefighting equipment which is to be kept in motor 
vehicles. Warning signals remain the same." 
  Scheduling of Fires. "By 0940 hours the chief of 
staff is to allocate fire missions and designate each battery's 
ammunition expenditure for each target, and prepare a table for 
allocation of fire missions, which will be used to assign 
missions to battery commanders on the terrain. To ensure the 
concealed transition from artillery preparation to artillery 
support of the assault, a single rate of fire on target 114 is 
to be calculated in the firing data table. To do this, total the 
assigned ammunition expenditure for each battery in the fourth 
shelling and against the first successive fire concentration 
line and divide it by the total time for delivering fire in 
these shellings. 
  "Upon receipt of the excerpt from the fire plan of the 5th 
RAG and the list of target coordinates, draw up a battalion fire 
plan; upon receipt of the coordinates of the battery fire 
positions, draw up a table of calculated firing data. Explain to 
the senior battery officers the order of carrying out fire 
missions for the periods of artillery preparation and support of 
the assault and check the accuracy and timeliness of preparation 
of calculated firing data tables in the batteries. 
  "Plan the relocation of the battalion simultaneously for all 
subunits: the first relocation--after completion of successive 
fire concentration against target 223--is to fire position area 
number two (see map), ready to deliver successive fire 
concentration against targets 444 and 548; the second 
relocation--with arrival of subunits of the 1st Motorized Rifle 
Battalion to line Hill 75.0, mound three--is to fire position 
area number three (see map). The route of relocation is the road 
junction, the bridge, Borki (see map). Begin relocation at the 
signal `Motor.'" 
  Preparation of Fire Control. "Have data on the 
batteries and firing conditions at the battalion fire control 
post by 1800 hours. 
  "Determine firing data by the method of deliberate 
preparation of fire. Calculate corrections on lines 43-00 and 
48-00 at ranges of 3.7 and 11 km using the second charge. By 
2000 hours check the readiness of the fire control post and 
computer operation, the correctness of calculating corrections, 
and the construction of correction charts. Meteorological 
messages for medium artillery will be transmitted by telephone 
from meteorological stations numbers 14 and 25 at the beginning 
of every even hour, beginning at 2000 hours 17 October, and 
during the course of combat operations they will be transmitted 
over radio. Radio operating data: call signs of the 
meteorological stations are Meteor-14 and Meteor-25; main 
frequency is 34.8 MHz; alternate frequency is 32.5 MHz. 
  "Control signals will be indicated in the excerpt from the 
5th RAG fire plan. 
  "Arbitrary numbers of the command and observation posts for 
input into the computer are: first post--for the battalion 
command and observation post; fourth post--for the 4th Battery 
command and observation post; fifth post--for the 5th Battery 
command and observation post; sixth post--for the 6th Battery 
command and observation post. 
  "Deploy bilateral observation as follows: the 4th Battery 
command and observation post is the right post, and the 
battalion command and observation post is the left post." 
  Political Work (for the deputy battalion commander 
for political affairs). "Direct political work with personnel at 
increasing combat effectiveness of subunits, strengthening the 
political-moral state, and successful accomplishment of the 
assigned mission; explaining the nature of the mission received 
and the order of carrying it out; sound knowledge of established 
signals and sequence of actions when these signals are given, 
particularly at night and when weapons of mass destruction have 
been used. Pay attention to careful preparation of combat 
equipment, instruments, communications equipment, and 
ammunition, and also to moral and psychological preparation of 
soldiers for combat operations; mobilize personnel for decisive 
and selfless actions during the offensive. 
  "To mobilize personnel, hold party and Komsomol meetings and 
briefings of the party and Komsomol aktiv; conduct political 
work with all categories of personnel, particularly with newly 
arrived replacements. Submit the political work plan for the 
period of preparing for and conducting combat operations to me 
for approval by 0930 hours 17 October." 
<H5>  Planning Combat Operations </H5>
  Timely dissemination of fire missions to subordinate subunit 
commanders and clarification of these missions on the terrain 
ensures speed in preparation of accurate fire and reliability of 
neutralizing targets. Therefore, the chief of staff begins 
work planning the artillery battalion's combat operations with 
scheduling of fires. He uses pre-prepared forms for speed in 
making auxiliary calculations and drawing up combat documents. 
He accomplishes scheduling of fires in the following sequence: 
  a) He determines the volume of battalion fire missions for 
artillery preparation of the assault (target numbers and size, 
shell expenditure established by the 5th RAG Headquarters for 
neutralizing each target) and records this in Table 8. 
  b) He determines the battalion's fire capabilities for this 
period, taking into account the number of guns in the batteries. 
In this case, they are expressed by the number of shells that 
are allotted for carrying out the fire missions for each 
shelling: 50 shells in the first (15 minutes) and 324 each in 
the third (11 minutes) and fourth (14 minutes). He also records 
these data in Table 8. In light of the fact that each battery 
has the same number of guns (six each), their fire capabilities 
are equal. 
  c) He allocates the fire missions among the batteries, 
taking 
into account the directions of the battalion commander. He 
designates shell expenditure for batteries for each target 
(taking into account the established shell expenditure) so that 
it is a multiple of the number of gun-mounts. Thus, in the first 
shelling an expenditure of 540 shells is established to 
neutralize target 114. According to the battalion commander's 
decision, three overlapping batteries are to be used to 
neutralize it. Fire will be delivered at three range settings 
and one azimuth setting. In all, there will be 6 guns X 3 range 
settings = 18 gun-mounts in each battery, and 18 X 3 = 54 
gun-mounts in the battalion. Consequently, there are 540 : 54 
= 10 shells for one gun-mount, and the shell expenditure for 
each battery will be 10 X 18 = 180 shells. 
  A shell expenditure of 324 shells is established to 
neutralize target 66 in the third shelling. Three overlapping 
batteries are to be used to neutralize the target. Fire will be 
delivered at three range settings and two azimuth settings. Each 
battery will have 36 gun-mounts, and the battalion will have 
108. Consequently, there will be 324 : 108 = 3 shells per 
gun-mount. Shell expenditure for each battery will be 3 X 36 = 
108 shells. 
  The results of the calculations are recorded in Table 8. 
  When distributing the established shell expenditure per 
gun-mount for the target in each shelling for each battery, 
there may be a shortage or excess of shells. In this case, the 
total number of these shells, equal to half or more of the 
number of gun mounts of one battery (from 9 to 18), is added to 
one of the batteries, if there is a shortage, or subtracted, if 
there is an excess. For example, an expenditure of 440 shells 
has been established to destroy the target; 144 shells are 
allocated to each battery, a total of 432 shells. The remainder 
of eight shells, being less than half the number of gun mounts 
of one battery, are not allocated additionally to any battery. 
  d) He determines the volume of battalion fire missions for 
the period of artillery support of the assault on the position 
of first-echelon battalions, between the first and second 
positions, and on the position of brigade reserves (target 
numbers and size on each line, shell expenditure) and records 
the results in Table 9. He checks to see that the shell 
expenditure against target 114 on the first line of successive 
fire concentration corresponds to the density of fire against 
this target in the last shelling of artillery preparation of the 
assault. This is necessary to ensure that the transition from 
artillery preparation of the assault to artillery support of the 
assault is unnoticed. 
  e) He allocates fire missions for the batteries for the 
period of artillery support of the assault. He designates shell 
expenditures against targets 223 and 548. In doing so, the shell 
expenditure per gun-mount against the targets is given as a 
fraction. The main criterion for designating shell expenditure 
is that it be a multiple of the number of gun-mounts. Let us 
examine the allocation of shell expenditure against target 223. 
The expenditure is established at 255 shells. Engagement of 
the target is done at three range settings and one azimuth 
setting. A battery has a total of 18 gun-mounts, and the 
battalion has a total of 54. For each gun-mount there are 255: 
54 = 4.7 shells. Hence, the shell expenditure for each battery 
will be 4.7 X 18 = 85 shells. The multiple of 18 gun-mounts is 
72 shells; therefore, the following shell expenditure is 
allocated: 4th Battery--72 shells, 5th Battery--108 shells, and 
6th Battery--72 shells, for a total of 252 shells. 
  The results of the calculations are entered in Table 8. 
  f) He reports to the artillery battalion commander on the 
allocation of fire missions to the batteries for the period of 
artillery preparation and artillery support of the assault. One 
copy of the table is given to the artillery battalion commander, 
and the other is left at the battalion headquarters for drawing 
up the fire plan.

*A total of 1.5 units of fire (1629 shells) are allotted for artillery support of the assault; an expenditure of 936 shells is allocated for delivery of 
successive fire concentration. It is planned to expend the remaining 684 shells during this period to neutralize newly reconnoitered targets. 


  Guided by the allocation of fire missions and the designated 
shell expenditure for each target in the shellings, the chief of 
staff tasks senior battery officers for preparation of 
ammunition. 
  The fire mission allocation table enables the battalion 
commander to allocate fire missions in a short time in the 
absence of the chief of staff. This table is particularly 
important when the batteries have different numbers of guns, 
and, consequently, their different fire capabilities. 
  Practical experience shows that the battalion fire plan will 
not always be drawn up by the time fire missions are to be 
assigned. Therefore, the battalion commander uses the prepared 
fire mission allocation table to assign missions. 
  At 1130 hours 17 October, the chief of staff of the 2d 
Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, received from the group staff 
an excerpt of the fire plan (Table 9) and a list of target 
coordinates (Table 10).

5th RAG Chief of Staff, Lt Col (I. Alekseyev) 


  According to the fire plan excerpt, the chief of staff 
establishes that the target numbers assigned earlier to the 
battalion and the established expenditure of shells for periods 
of artillery preparation and artillery support of the assault 
coincide with the fire plan data. In the period of artillery 
accompaniment of the troop offensive, he pays attention to the 
missions being carried out by combined-arms subunits and the 
artillery battalion, after which he plots the battalion's fire 
missions on the work map.

  Using the allocation of targets made earlier (Table 8), the 
chief of staff draws up a battalion fire plan (Table 11) and 
compiles a list of target coordinates for the battalion as an 
attachment to the fire plan.

Commander of 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, Maj (G. Vishnyakov) 

Chief of Staff Capt (O. Lebedev) 


  The chief of staff plans the relocation of the battalion 
based on instructions of the group staff and the battalion 
commander in the following sequence: He notes lines on the work 
map (see Figure 11) at the boundary the position of the 1st 
Motorized Rifle Battalion subunits as of the time of completion 
of successive fire concentration with the inscription "RN" (line 
of beginning battalion relocation); also marks the battery fire 
positions in the designated area; highlights the relocation 
route and measures its length (4.5 km); calculates the time 
required for relocation (11 minutes for leaving the fire 
positions + 14 minutes for moving to new area + 23 minutes for 
deployment into battle formation = 48 minutes total); determines 
the distance the advancing subunits will cover from the line of 
beginning the relocation at the given pace of 3 km/hr (2 km); 
puts this distance on the work map and marks it with a line with 
the inscription "RG" "S" + 48 minutes ("RG" being the battalion 
readiness line, "S" being the relocation signal). This means 
that the tank and motorized rifle subunits are expected to reach 
this line by the time the battalion is ready to open fire from 
the new fire positions. 
  The chief of staff plans the second relocation in the same 
manner. 
<H3>  Carrying Out Measures for Preparing Subunits of the 2d 
Battalion, 8th Artillery Regiment, for Combat Operations </H3>
  By 1300 hours 17 October, the battalion chief of staff has 
drawn up a fire plan and plotted on the work map the available 
information on the enemy, the forward edge of defense of 
friendly subunits, the battalion's fire missions (according to 
coordinates received from the group staff), the base line of 
fire, and other data. 
  Carrying out the measures for preparing the battalion for 
combat operations (see Table 7), at 1330 hours the chief of 
staff began checking the operability of the computer in the 
chief of staff's vehicle and the APK's in the senior battery 
officers' vehicles, which he completed by 1400 hours. After 
this, he checked the readiness of the weather station 
instruments for combat work, checking the operation of sensors 
for wind velocity and direction, temperature, and humidity. 
  On two guns in each battery he checked the sighting devices, 
recoil devices, the operation of gun mechanisms, and also 
documentation. 
  At 1800 hours the chief of staff heard a report by the motor 
vehicle mechanic on the results of checking the condition of 
artillery prime movers and motor vehicles (on the problems 
detected and on their refueling), after which he gave 
instructions on correcting the problems. 
  At 1820 hours the chief of staff assembled the battalion 
plotters and checked the readiness of fire control instruments 
for combat work. On his direction, the battery fire positions 
and targets scheduled for artillery preparation and artillery 
support of the assault were plotted on the fire control 
instruments according to available coordinates, and topographic 
data on these targets were calculated and recorded in the 
calculated firing data tables. 
  Next the chief of staff calculated the rate of delivery of 
fire for each battery by shellings of artillery preparation and 
artillery support of the assault. Thus, the 4th Battery is 
allotted an expenditure of 180 shells against target 114 in the 
first shelling. Four shells of volley fire are allotted for each 
battery for the first minute of the shelling (4X6=24 shells). 
The remaining 156 shells (180-24) are expended in 14 minutes 
(840 seconds) by salvo fire. The rate of fire for the battery is 
840:156=5 seconds per round. 
  When calculating the rate of fire against target 114 in the 
last (fourth) shelling (14 minutes) and against the first 
successive fire concentration line (3 minutes), the chief of 
staff added up the expenditure of shells for each battery 
separately (for example, the expenditure for the 6th Battery: 
108+36=144 shells, and the time of delivering fire 14+3=17 
minutes). Four shells of volley fire are allotted for the first 
minute of the shelling (per battery--4X6=24 shells). The 
remaining 120 shells (144-24) are expended in 16 minutes (960 
seconds) by salvo fire. The rate of fire for the battery is 
960:120=8 seconds per round. 
  After receiving data on the enemy and friendly subunits from 
the group staff, the chief of staff plotted them on the work map 
(see Figure 11). 
<H5>  Work on the Terrain </H5>
  At 0800 hours 17 October, the artillery reconnaissance group 
arrived at the battalion fire position area. The chief of the 
ARG planned the sequence of work (Figure 12) and, assembling the 
group, assigned the mission: 
  "We have arrived at the battalion fire position area and are 
located at the western edge of the brush; look at the map. I 
will orient you... (he indicates the direction to one of the 
sides of the horizon and shows from right to left local features 
that can be seen, comparing their position with the map). 
  "The enemy is defending to the west at a distance of 2.5 km. 
  "Gun platoon commanders are to organize selection of fire 
positions in the areas: 4th Battery--the near slopes of Hill 
83.0; 6th Battery--at the single tree; 5th Battery--here, in the 
vicinity of the brush. The site for the battalion fire control 
post is in this same brush. 
  "The base line of fire is grid azimuth 43-00. The minimum 
firing range is 2,500 meters. 
  "Begin work on selecting fire positions after conducting 
radiation and chemical reconnaissance in this area and checking 
the terrain for mines. The sequence for the check is: fire 
positions of the 5th, 4th, and 6th batteries. Considering that 
deployment of the batteries will take place at night, pay 
attention to the selection of access routes to the fire 
positions and natural cover for prime movers and motor vehicles. 
At each fire position clear the field of fire and prepare 
emplacements for guns, ammunition shelters, and slit trenches 
for personnel. Clear the fire positions of highly inflammable 
objects for protection against enemy incendiary weapons. Perform 
engineer work at night and complete it by 0600 hours 18 October. 
Work is to start after approval of the selected fire positions. 
  "Topogeodetic survey of the fire positions is to be done by 
map using the navigation equipment of the senior battery 
officer's vehicle; grid azimuths of the bearing to aiming points 
are by the gyroscopic method. Topogeodetic survey is to be 
checked by performing it again from different spot heights. 
  "Before 0930 hours today, the dosimeter operator-instructor 
is to check the terrain in the planned fire position areas of 
the 4th, 5th, and 6th batteries and on the routes between them 
for the presence of radioactive and chemical contamination, and 
report the results to me. 
  "Pvt Novikov is to use a mine detector to check the terrain 
in the fire position areas of the 4th, 5th, and 6th batteries 
and on the routes between them for the presence of mines. Report 
the results to me. 
  "The senior topogeodetic surveyor is to perform orientation 
of the vehicle using a gyrocompass. Survey the positions from a 
spot height--elevation from spot height 83.0, x = 
19,975, y = 60,995; terminal point--road junction, 
x = 19,305, y = 60,615." 




    Personnel of the artillery reconnaissance group began 
carrying out the assigned tasks. After completion of work by the 
dosimeter operator-instructor and the gun crew member with the 
mine detector, the ARG chief heard their reports on the results 
of reconnaissance, personally selected the 5th Battery fire 
positions, and performed work in accordance with articles 70 and 
71 of the manual for combat work of artillery fire subunits, and 
also selected the site for the battalion fire control post. He 
then distributed the 5th Battery personnel that arrived with him 
to perform engineer work, taking one of the sergeants with him, 
departed for the fire position of the 4th Battery fire position 
and then the 6th Battery. 
  At the fire positions of the 4th and 6th Batteries, the ARG 
commander heard reports from the platoon gun commanders on the 
results of work in selecting fire positions and recorded the 
coordinates of the fire positions. Here is a variant of the 
report by a fire platoon commander of the 4th Battery: 
  "A fire position has been selected (he shows it on the 
terrain). The location of the main gun and other guns is marked 
by pegs; the base line is shown using landmarks; these are the 
main, alternate, and night aiming points (he shows them on the 
terrain). From the fire position it is possible to fire at 
minimum range: on the base line--1,800 meters; with a deflection 
shift of 3-00 to the right--1,700 meters; and with a deflection 
shift of 3-00 to the left--2,100 meters. Radiation and chemical 
reconnaissance of the fire position area has been conducted, and 
the area has been checked for mines. No contamination or mines 
were discovered. These are the locations of the observation 
post, prime movers and motor vehicles, and access roads (he 
shows them on the terrain). The chosen fire position makes it 
possible to deploy the fire platoons at night without being 
detected. Its coordinates are: x = 19,770, 
y = 60,915, h = 80. The coordinates will 
be updated after topogeodetic survey has been completed." 
  At 1045 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander 
and battery commanders arrived at the 5th Battery fire position. 
  The chief of the artillery reconnaissance group reported to 
the battalion commander: "We are located at the western edge of 
the brush (he shows him on the terrain and on the map). Ahead of 
us is the unnamed height running to the west. On the right is 
spot height 83.0...(he indicates the local features). 
  "The artillery reconnaissance group has selected the fire 
positions: for the 4th Battery--on the southern slopes of Hill 
83.0, coordinates x = 19,770, y = 60,915, 
h = 80; for the 5th Battery--here, coordinates 
x = 19,430, y = 61,680. h = 82; 
for the 6th Battery--in the vicinity of the single tree, 
coordinates x = 18,885, y = 61,050, 
h = 80 (he points them out on the terrain). 
  "No contamination or mines were discovered in the fire 
position area. 
  "The selected fire positions make it possible to fire at 
assigned ranges and to accommodate all guns of the batteries; 
natural cover has been selected to accommodate prime movers and 
motor vehicles. Access roads are satisfactory. Topogeodetic 
survey and engineer preparation of the fire positions are being 
conducted. 
  "Taking into account the expected delivery of ammunition at 
night, areas for unloading shells on the ground have been 
selected 20-40 meters from each gun." 
  The battalion commander approved the ARG chief's report and 
issued the following instructions: 
  For Local Security and Self-Defense. "The axis of 
Hill 90.3 and Hill `Bob' is a likely avenue of tank approach. 
Post an observation post in each battery for the period of 
conducting engineer preparation of the fire positions. Check 
personnel's knowledge of established warning signals. After 
deployment of the fire platoons, in each battery assign missions 
for combating tanks in the event of their breakthrough." 
  For Organizing Communications. "For the senior 
signals officer. These are the approximate positions of the 
battery and battalion command and observation posts, and the 
group's observation post and command post...(he indicates them 
on the map). The battery fire positions were indicated earlier. 
  "Ensure communications with the battery command and 
observation post and fire platoons, by landline prior to 
initiation of artillery preparation of the assault and by radio 
after its initiation and during the course of the offensive. 
Receive weather data on the meteorological information radio 
net; warning signals are to be received and transmitted over all 
communications channels. Readiness for landline communications 
is at 2000 hours 17 October; readiness for radio communications 
is at 0430 hours 18 October. Submit the radio and landline 
communications diagram at 1800 hours 17 October." 
  The battalion commander ordered the battery commanders: 
"Depart for your batteries to supervise work for preparation, 
topogeodetic survey, and engineer preparation of the fire 
positions; by 1300 hours check the organization and conduct of 
reconnaissance from the battery observation posts and study the 
terrain in the enemy dispositions; arrive at the battalion 
command and observation post by 1430 hours, where the combat 
order will be issued. I am departing for the battalion command 
and observation post and then for the commander of the 5th RAG 
to participate in commander's reconnaissance." 
  During the course of receiving the mission from the 
battalion 
commander, the intelligence officer plotted the necessary data 
on the work map, after which he began planning reconnaissance. 
  During the planning, he determined the following: 
reconnaissance missions for the subunits; zones of 
reconnaissance for each battery; areas of special attention; 
approximate locations of the battery and battalion command and 
observation posts; the position of the radar, its sector of 
surveillance, and area of special attention; the numbering of 
targets for the subunits; and the procedure for and time of 
submitting reconnaissance information. 
  At 0740 hours 17 October, the reconnaissance subunits of the 
5th RAG arrived in the vicinity of the command and observation 
post on the southeastern slopes of Hill 88.0. Having left the 
reconnaissance subunits in the shelter, the battalion 
intelligence officer participated in the work of the 5th RAG 
intelligence officer to clarify the reconnaissance missions on 
the terrain. As a result, the battalion intelligence officer 
clarified: the code names of local features; reference points; 
the position of the forward edge of the enemy defenses and the 
most important objectives (targets); the forward edge of 
friendly subunits; the area of the battalion command and 
observation post; and the approximate position of the group 
observation post. Here the artillery reconnaissance radar was 
turned over to the battalion intelligence officer. 
  At 0750 hours 17 October, the battalion intelligence officer 
assigned missions to the battery headquarters platoon commanders 
and the senior radar officer: 
  "We are located at Hill 88.0. Ahead of us is a group of 
yellow bushes--the line to the west. These are the code names of 
local features and the reference points...(he indicates them on 
the terrain). 
  "The enemy is defending with the forward edge running on the 
following line...(he indicates it on the terrain). 
  "The battalion is tasked to conduct reconnaissance in the 
following zone: on the right--Hill `Bob,' spot height 92.0; on 
the left--the southern slopes of Hill 88.0, mound 3. The zones 
of reconnaissance for the batteries are: for the 4th Battery..., 
for the 5th Battery..., for the 6th Battery... (he indicates 
them on the terrain). 
  "Reconnaissance missions are: before 2100 hours 17 October, 
determine the location of strong points, the presence of 
artificial obstacles, particularly on the unnamed hill at the 
road, in the vicinity of the brush, and at the road junction; 
reconnoiter targets and determine their coordinates--fire 
weapons (particularly antitank weapons), and also observation 
posts of mortar platoons in the vicinity of the bushes, the 
dairy farm, and the single grove. 
  "Select positions for the command and observation posts: 4th 
Battery--at Hill `Bob'; 5th Battery and the battalion command 
and observation post--on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0; 6th 
Battery--on the southern slopes of Hill 88.0 (he indicates them 
on the terrain). 
  "Select a position for the radar on the southern slopes of 
Hill 88.0. Begin reconnaissance at 0830 hours 17 October. 
Communications will be the landline. During the course of 
combat, relocate jointly with the battalion command and 
observation post ready for deployment at its halt points, 
approximately in the vicinity of the road junction, 300 meters 
east of the bridge. Signals are... (he informs them of the 
signals). 
  "Target numbering is as follows: mortar batteries: 4th 
Battery--20-22, 5th Battery--23-24, 6th Battery--25-26, 
battalion command and observation post--27-30; the remaining 
targets: 4th Battery--60-63, 5th Battery--64-67, 6th 
Battery--68-71, battalion command and observation post--72-76, 
and the radar site--71-80. 
  "Submit reconnaissance reports to the battalion command and 
observation post immediately after detecting a target. Begin 
checking the operation of reconnaissance instruments and 
determine their individual corrections, after which you will 
begin selecting locations for the command and observation posts 
and conducting reconnaissance." 
  At 0930 hours 17 October, the intelligence officer of the 2d 
Bn, 8th Arty Regt, arrived at the command and observation post 
of the 1st Bn (on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0) located in 
the combat formations of the defending 19th Motorized Rifle Regt 
and reported to the battalion commander: "Sr Lt Mayorov, 
intelligence officer of the 2d Bn, has arrived to receive 
reconnaissance reports on the enemy." 
  The intelligence officer clarified the following on the 
terrain: the forward edge of the enemy's defenses in the sector 
of Hill 90.3, the dairy farm; the location and numbering of 
defending subunits; the location and approximate boundaries of 
reconnoitered platoon strong points; the location of individual 
targets, minefields, and artificial obstacles; the line where 
the position of brigade reserves was being prepared and the 
dispositions of reserves; where and which artillery batteries 
and mortar platoons had been reconnoitered; and the strength of 
enemy subunits. 
  The intelligence officer received an excerpt from the 
reconnaissance report register (Table 12) and a sketch plan of 
targets (Figure 13). 




    At 1020 hours, the commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, 
arrived at the command and observation post, where he heard the 
report by the intelligence officer on available reconnaissance 
information: 
  "We are located on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0 (he 
indicates this on the map). Ahead is a group of yellow 
bushes--the line to the west. 
  "These are the code names of local features and reference 
points received from the 5th RAG intelligence officer and 
additionally assigned by me... (he indicates them on the 
terrain). 
  "The command and observation posts are deployed as follows: 
the battalion command and observation post is here; the command 
and observation posts for the 4th, 5th, and 6th batteries and 
the position of the radar are as shown... (he indicates them on 
the terrain). 
  "Reconnaissance has been organized in the designated zone... 
(he indicates this on the terrain). 
  "The following reconnaissance information has been received 
from the 1st Arty Bn: 
  "--The forward edge of the enemy's defenses runs along the 
line: the eastern slopes of Hill 90.3, the hill at the 
road--`Banan,' the nameless hill, and the dairy farm. Part of 
the forces of two motorized infantry armored groups (2d Bn, 28th 
Inf Regt, and 1st Bn, 13th Inf Regt) are defending on this 
sector at the positions of the first echelon battalions. The 
boundary between them is 300-350 meters south of Hill `Banan' 
(he indicates this on the terrain). A company of the battalion's 
second echelon is defending in the vicinity of the individual 
grove, the cutting on the road, pit 4. 
  "The enemy suffered heavy losses in previous battles, and 
the 
strength of his subunits is 55-60 percent. 
  "Platoon strong points (see the sketch plan of targets, 
Figure 13, and the reconnaissance report register, Table 12) 
have been reconnoitered: there are two at the forward edge and 
one in the rear. Their boundaries have not been precisely 
determined. Targets in them have been reconnoitered...(he 
indicates them on the terrain). Targets outside the platoon 
strong points are...(he indicates them on the terrain). 
  "The position of brigade reserves is being prepared on the 
line...(he indicates this on the map). Two artillery batteries 
are in the area...(he indicates this on the map). 
  "Newly received reconnaissance reports will be submitted to 
the group intelligence officer by 1200 hours."

Intelligence Officer, 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, Sr Lt (I. Mayorov) 


  The artillery battalion commander assigned the intelligence 
officer additional tasks: clarify the boundaries of the platoon 
strong points; make final reconnaissance of the dispositions of 
weapons, particularly antitank weapons, in and outside the 
strong points. 
  At 1230 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander 
arrived at the location of the 5th RAG commander on the western 
edge of brush "Melkiy" and, as a result of participating in his 
commander's reconnaissance, clarified the following: the code 
names of local features and reference points; the combat 
formation of the enemy's 4th Brigade and the alignment of its 
defense (disposition of enemy strong points, artillery, and 
reserves and the possible axes of counterattack); the zone of 
advance and combat missions of the 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, 
fire missions of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, for the periods of 
artillery preparation and support of the assault (the centers 
and size of targets on the terrain), and the fire missions of 
other artillery subunits in the 1st Motorized Rifle Bn's zone of 
advance. 
  During the course of the group commander's update on the 
procedure for cooperation, the artillery battalion commander 
clarified the following: the artillery battalion's time of 
movement and deployment to the fire position area, the order of 
accomplishing fire missions during artillery preparation of the 
assault, safety measures when tank and motorized rifle subunits 
pass through the battalion's fire position area, the final 
coordination line and how to deliver fire in the event the 1st 
Motorized Rifle Bn is delayed in reaching this line, the 
procedure for fire control during the course of artillery 
support of the assault, the start and order of relocation of 
command and observation posts and fire platoons, the order of 
accomplishment of missions by the artillery battalion when 
supporting commitment of the second echelon to battle and 
repelling counterattacks by enemy reserves, the order of 
assuming command and control of the group in the event the group 
command and observation post is disabled, and control and 
coordination signals. 
  During the course of the commander's reconnaissance, the 
artillery battalion commander plotted on the work map data on 
the enemy dispositions, fire missions, and other information. 
  At 1320 hours 17 October, the commander of the 2d Arty Bn, 
8th Arty Regt, arrived at Hill 88.0 at the location of the 
commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, and reported 
to him: 
  "Comrade Major! Major Vishnyakov, commander of the 2d Arty 
Bn, 8th Arty Regt, reporting. 
  "An artillery battalion of 152-mm D-1 howitzers comprised of 
three six-gun batteries is assigned to support the 1st Bn, 5th 
Motorized Rifle Regt. The artillery battalion is presently 
located in the area... (he indicates it on the map) and is 
preparing to carry out the assigned missions. It has 1.0 unit of 
fire of ammunition and 0.7 fuelings of fuel. By 2100 hours 17 
October, 2.5 units of fire will be delivered. By 1800 hours 17 
October the motor transport will be refueled. 
  "In the artillery preparation of the assault, the battalion 
is to neutralize two platoon strong points, targets 114 and 66. 
The battalion's fire capabilities will be used fully during this 
period. In the artillery support of the assault, the artillery 
battalion is to support the battalion's offensive with a double 
successive fire concentration; the artillery battalion is to 
participate in the first group of artillery firing and 
neutralize target 114 on the first line, on the signal 'Bars' 
and target 223 on the second line, on the signal `Volk.' 
  "During development of the assault between the first and 
second positions and when repelling possible counterattacks by 
enemy brigade reserves, the artillery battalion is to be ready 
to deliver, in depth, concentrated fire against target 174 and a 
`Pikhta-2' fixed barrage. Upon breakthrough of the position of 
brigade reserves, the assault is to be supported by a single 
successive fire concentration; the artillery battalion is to 
neutralize target 444 on the first line, on the signal `Rys' and 
target 548 on the second line, on the signal `Shakal.' 
  "In addition to neutralizing these targets, during this 
period the artillery battalion, taking into account the number 
of rounds allotted, is capable of additionally neutralizing with 
a density of 0.5 two platoon strong points or two artillery 
batteries (two mortar platoons) or seven-eight single targets. 
  "The fire position area is: Hill 83.0, the single tree, the 
brush (he indicates this on the map). The line of the command 
and observation post is: Hill `Bob,' Hill 88.0 (he indicates 
this on the terrain). The artillery battalion will be ready to 
open fire at 0630 hours 18 October." 
  At 1330 hours, the commander of the 1st Motorized Rifle Bn 
began conducting commander's reconnaissance, in which the 
commanders of organic and attached subunits participated. During 
the commander's reconnaissance, they studied the terrain on the 
axis of the battalion's advance, the code names of local 
features, reference points, the alignment of the enemy's 
defenses (the outline of the forward edge, and the dispositions 
of enemy strong points and the degree of their engineer 
preparation, the positions of fire weapons, especially antitank 
weapons, the position of other objectives, approaches to the 
forward edge of the enemy's defenses, the presence and nature of 
obstacles, possible lines of attack of enemy helicopters, and 
axes of counterattacks by enemy reserves). 
  The following were updated: attack frontage, the direction 
of 
concentration of the main efforts, and the combat mission of the 
battalion; what enemy fire weapons, control posts, and other 
targets were to be destroyed by artillery fire from 
indirect-fire positions and by fire from guns and tanks 
allocated for direct firing; the fire positions of organic and 
attached fire weapons; the location of passages in barriers and 
across obstacles; the time for clearing them (setting them up); 
and the direction of relocation of the battalion command and 
observation post. 
  From the combat order issued by the commander of the 1st 
Motorized Rifle Bn, the commander of the 2d Arty Bn, 8th Arty 
Regt, clarified the following: 
  1. Defending ahead of the offensive frontage of the 1st 
Motorized Rifle Bn at positions of the first-echelon battalions 
are two reinforced motorized infantry platoons of the motorized 
infantry armor group of the 2d Bn, 28th Inf Regt, and two 
motorized infantry platoons of the motorized infantry armored 
group of the 1st Bn, 13th Inf Regt, with one platoon from each 
of the motorized infantry armored groups on the forward edge and 
one from each in the rear. The enemy defenses are being improved 
over two days. During the course of the offensive by the 5th 
Motorized Rifle Regt, a counterattack by the brigade reserve is 
possible in the direction of mound 3, "Kruglaya" grove. 
  2. The 1st Motorized Rifle Bn with reinforcements is to 
destroy the defending enemy with an attack from the line of 
march in the vicinity of Hill "Banan," (exc.) the dairy farm, 
"Kruglaya" grove, and seize line (exc.) Hill 92.0, pit 4; the 
subsequent mission is to develop the offensive, rout the enemy 
brigade reserve in cooperation with adjacent battalions, and 
seize the line the group of trees, mound 3; it is then to 
advance in the direction of Borki, Peschanaya (not on the map). 
  3. Ahead of the offensive frontage of the 1st Motorized 
Rifle 
Bn, during the artillery preparation and artillery support of 
the assault the artillery and other fire weapons are to

  Subunits of the 1st Bn, 19th Motorized Rifle Regt, are 
defending in direct contact with the enemy on a line with Hill 
"Bob," Gushchino. 
  4. The 1st Motorized Rifle Bn, concentrating main efforts in 
the direction of Hill 88.0, "Kruglaya" grove, Borki, and using 
artillery fire and air strikes, with an attack from the line of 
march by reinforced first-echelon companies dismounted is to 
destroy enemy subunits at the position of first-echelon 
battalions and seize this line; it is to develop the offensive 
in the direction of the bridge, Borki, and in cooperation with 
adjacent battalions defeat the enemy brigade reserves and seize 
this line. The battalion's combat formation is in two echelons: 
the 1st and 2d reinforced motorized rifle companies in the first 
echelon, and the 3d Motorized Rifle Company in the second. The 
attached tank company is to be used for cooperation with the 
first-echelon companies. When repelling counterattacks by 
brigade reserves, establish closer cooperation with the 2d 
Motorized Rifle Bn and the regiment's antitank reserve. 
  5. The 1st Motorized Rifle Company with a rocket launcher 
platoon and engineer platoon, in cooperation with the 1st Tank 
Platoon, 1st Tank Company, is to attack from the line of march 
and destroy the enemy in the strong points in the areas of Hill 
"Banan" and the road junction and seize them; it is to further 
advance in the direction of the road junction, the bridge. The 
4th Battery is to provide support. 
  The 2d Motorized Rifle Company with an antitank platoon, two 
squads from the engineer platoon, in cooperation with the 1st 
Tank Company (minus a platoon), is to attack from the line of 
march and destroy the enemy in its strong point 400 meters north 
of the dairy farm and seize it; it is to further advance in the 
direction of the brush, grove "Uzkaya." The 6th Battery is to 
provide support. 
  The 3d Motorized Rifle Company is the battalion second 
echelon and during the course of the offensive moves behind the 
first echelon in the direction of Hill 88.0, grove "Kruglaya." 
The point of commitment to battle is the bridge, the single 
house. Upon commitment to battle, a mortar battery is to be 
resubordinated to the company. To support the commitment to 
battle, the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, is to be ready to neutralize 
enemy fire weapons on the nameless hill in front of the line of 
commitment to battle. 
  6. Ammunition expenditure for the day is: 1.5 units for fire 
for small arms; 3.5 units of fire for artillery; and 2.5 units 
of fire for antiaircraft weapons. 
  7. Readiness for the offensive is at 0530 hours 18 October. 
  8. The location of the command and observation post is: 
During the move up--at the head of the column of the 1st 
Motorized Rifle Company; with the start of the assault--on the 
northern slopes of Hill 88.0; during the course of the offensive 
it is to move in the direction of the brush, grove "Kruglaya," 
Borki. 
  Continuing work to organize the battle, the battalion 
commander began organizing cooperation, for which he coordinated 
the following matters: 
  (a) During the move up to the final coordination line and 
conducting artillery preparation of the assault: 
  Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt: 
"The battalion is to move from the assembly area to the line of 
deployment into company columns over the route Vidino, Yelovoye, 
Hill 77.8, Doni. Column alignment is to be: battalion 
headquarters, the 1st Tank Company, the 1st, 2d and 3d motorized 
rifle companies, and the supply platoon. Intervals between the 
vehicles and subunits are to be 50 meters; speed of movement is 
to be 25 km/hr. 
  "The battalion is to reach the line of deployment into 
battalion columns (he indicates on the map) at H-hour -0:57. The 
artillery preparation of the assault is to begin at this time, 
and the battalion is to advance further under cover of artillery 
fire and air strikes. 
  "Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, report its 
configuration and fire missions." 
  Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "The 
duration of the artillery preparation of the assault is 50 
minutes; its configuration is four shellings: the first will 
last 15 minutes and is to destroy personnel and fire weapons in 
the strong points on the forward edge of the enemy defenses; the 
second will last 10 minutes and is to destroy targets by direct 
fire; the third will last 11 minutes and is to destroy personnel 
and fire weapons in strong points deep in the enemy defenses; 
the fourth will last 14 minutes and is to destroy personnel and 
fire weapons in strong points at the forward edge of the enemy 
defenses." 
  Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt: 
"The battalion is to reach the line for deployment into company 
columns at H-hour -0:28, and the subunits are to proceed further 
along the following routes: 1st Motorized Rifle Company..., 2d 
Motorized Rifle Company..., 3d Motorized Rifle Company...(he 
indicates them on the map). Upon reaching the line (exc.) the 
single house, spot height 79.4, the 1st and 2d motorized rifle 
companies are to operate by platoons. 
  "In the event the enemy uses weapons of mass destruction or 
delivers conventional fire, be prepared to negotiate the 
contaminated zones or bypass the area under fire; the 3d 
Motorized Rifle Company is to be ready to replace one of the 
first-echelon companies that will suffer heavy losses. 
  "On reaching the line Hill `Bob,' the western slopes of Hill 
88.0, the first-echelon companies are to merge and continue 
movement behind the tanks at an accelerated pace in squad 
columns. Reach the final coordination line at H-hour -0:07 (he 
shows it on the terrain). The armored personnel carriers are to 
advance in the intervals between the squads from cover to cover 
and support the assault by friendly subunits. 
  "During artillery preparation of the assault, the regiment's 
combat engineers are to use explosives to clear passages in the 
obstacles, three for each first-echelon company, and mark them 
with rectangular markers numbered: 1, 2, and 3 for the 1st 
Motorized Rifle Company; 4, 5, and 6 for the 2d Motorized Rifle 
Company. The battalion command and observation post is to deploy 
on the northern slopes of Hill 88.0. 
  (b) During execution of the immediate mission: 
  Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt: 
"A tank company is to advance from the final coordination line 
to the passages in the minefields and cross them. Motorized 
riflemen are to advance behind the tanks in squad columns. After 
crossing the minefields, subunits are to deploy into an extended 
line and, firing on the move, rush behind the tanks to the 
forward edge. The order of actions of the armored personnel 
carriers is: Half of them are to stop in front of the enemy 
obstacles and support the subunits' attack with stationary fire; 
the rest are to advance behind the motorized rifle subunits from 
cover to cover. 
  "Artillery battalion commander, report on the beginning and 
order of accomplishing artillery support of the assault." 
  Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "Artillery 
support of the assault is to commence at H-hour -:07 and be 
accomplished with a double successive fire concentration. Fire 
is to be opened against the first line on the signal 'Bars' and 
delivered forward of the attack frontage of the 1st Motorized 
Rifle Bn against target 114--the strong point at the forward 
edge of the enemy defenses. Fire is to be delivered 
simultaneously against targets on the second line. To ensure an 
undetected transition from artillery preparation of the assault 
to artillery support of the assault, fire is to be delivered 
against target 114 without changing settings, that is, it is to 
be a continuation of artillery preparation of the assault. Fire 
is to be delivered against this target until the tanks and 
motorized riflemen reach the safety limit from our shellbursts. 
I will clarify this line... (he indicates it on the terrain)." 
  Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt: 
"After the tanks and motorized riflemen reach the safety limit, 
a signal is to be given at the direction of the company 
commanders--a series of red flares. After receiving this signal, 
I will give the signal 'Volk' to shift fire to the second line. 
This command will be transmitted to the commander of the 1st Bn, 
8th Arty Regt, via the RAG commander. 
  "The battalions' fire against targets on the third line will 
be requested through the RAG commander. 
  "The advance on the enemy in its strong points is to be 
accomplished dismounted. The assets of antitank and rocket 
launcher platoons are to be used more fully. 
  "After seizing the strong point located in `Kruglaya' grove, 
the commander of the 2d Motorized Rifle Company is to dispatch a 
combat reconnaissance patrol in the direction of pit 4, mound 3 
to ascertain the composition and nature of actions of enemy 
brigade reserves. If the enemy withdraws, continue the advance. 
  "Counterattacks by small enemy groups are to be repelled by 
fire from all assets, without halting the advance. 
  "A counterattack by brigade reserves in the direction of 
mound 3, 'Kruglaya' grove, should probably be expected after 
seizing the first-echelon company strong points. Commander of 
the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, report what missions the battalion is 
to carry out to repel counterattacks by brigade reserves." 
  Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "When 
brigade reserves move up, the battalion will prepare 
concentrated fire against target 174 (he indicates it on the 
map); when the enemy goes over to a counterattack, the battalion 
will prepare a `Pikhta-2' fixed barrage deep into the second 
line." 
  Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt: 
"To avoid excessive losses, first-echelon companies are to repel 
the counterattack with stationary fire in cooperation with the 
tank company and antitank reserve, which is to be deployed on a 
line with the bridge and the brush. Antitank assets attached 
to the companies are to move up to convenient positions, taking 
into account the nature of the terrain. 
  "Depending on the results of the counterattack, the 3d 
Motorized Rifle Company, the second echelon of the 1st Bn, 5th 
Motorized Rifle Regt, will be committed to battle from the 
planned line to deliver a strike against the flank of the 
counterattacking enemy. 
  "Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, what missions is the 
battalion to carry out to support the commitment of the 3d 
Motorized Rifle Company?" 
  Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "The 
battalion will prepare concentrated fire against target 67." 
  (c) During execution of the subsequent mission: 
  Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt: 
"After execution of the immediate mission, battalion subunits 
are to continue the offensive. After commitment of the 3d 
Motorized Rifle Company to battle, the 2d Motorized Rifle 
Company is to be withdrawn to the reserve. 
  "The battalion is to break through the position of the 
brigade reserves on the move. 
  "Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt, report the order of 
artillery support of the assault during breakthrough of the 
brigade reserves' position." 
  Commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty Regt: "Artillery 
support of the assault on the brigade reserves' position is to 
be accomplished by successive fire concentration against two 
lines. Fire is to be opened against the first line on signal 
`Rys' after the battalion subunits reach a distance of 
1,500-1,700 meters from the forward edge and will be delivered 
until they reach the safety limit. Fire will then be shifted to 
the second line on the signal 'Shakal' from the maneuver 
battalion commander." 
  Commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Bn: 
"The signals are... (he announces them)." 
  During the course of participating in the maneuver battalion 
commander's reconnaissance, the commander of the 2d Bn, 8th Arty 
Regt, plotted on the work map enemy data, the maneuver 
battalion's missions, and the line of commitment to battle of 
the second echelon (3d Motorized Rifle Company). 
  At 1420 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander 
returned to the battalion command and observation post, where 
the battery commanders had arrived. The artillery battalion 
commander heard reports by the intelligence officer on the newly 
reconnoitered targets and by the battery commanders on their 
study of the terrain in the enemy's dispositions. The battalion 
commander then clarified the code names of local features, 
reference points, the disposition of the enemy's defenses, the 
disposition of fire weapons in strong points (targets 114 and 
223), the combat mission of the maneuver battalion, and the 
artillery battalion's fire missions for artillery preparation 
and support of the assault (the targets and their boundaries 
across the front and in the rear). 
  At 1430 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander 
issued the combat order: 
  "1. The enemy is defending with subunits of the 4th Brigade 
on a line with the forward edge running along the eastern slopes 
of Hill 90.3, Hill 'Banan,' the dairy farm (he indicates this on 
the terrain). Platoon strong points have been 
reconnoitered--targets 114 and 223; the strong points are 
equipped with fighting and communication trenches and weapon 
emplacements; minefields have been set up in front of the 
forward edge and in the intervals between strong points. 
  "Reserves of up to a motorized infantry battalion are 
probably in the vicinity of... (he indicates on the map). Two 
batteries of 155-mm howitzers are in the area of... (he 
indicates on the map). 
  "2. The 1st Motorized Rifle Bn with the 1st Tank Company and 
a combat engineer platoon will advance on a front 300 meters 
north of Hill `Banan,' (exc.) the dairy farm. The immediate 
mission is to destroy enemy personnel and fire weapons in the 
first-echelon company strong points in the area of Hill `Banan,' 
(exc.) the dairy farm, `Kruglaya' grove, and seize the line 
along Hill 92.0, pit 4; the subsequent mission is, in 
cooperation with adjacent battalions, to rout the enemy brigade 
reserve and seize the line along the group of trees, mound 3; 
advance further in the direction of Borki, Peschanaya (not on 
the map). 
  "The combat formation is in two echelons. The 1st Tank 
Company in first, the 1st Motorized Rifle Company on the right, 
and the 2d Motorized on the left; the 3d Motorized Rifle Company 
in second echelon. The line of commitment to battle of the 3d 
Motorized Rifle Company is the bridge, (exc.) the road. 
  "The 3d Bn, 7th Motorized Rifle Regt, is to advance on the 
right. The boundary with it is the single house, (exc.) Hill 
92.0, spot height 75.0. 
  "The 2d Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, is to advance on the

be four shellings: the first will last--15 minutes; the 
second--10 minutes; the third--11 minutes; and the fourth--14 
minutes. 
  "The artillery battalion's fire position area is the 
southern 
slope of Hill 83.0, the single tree, and the brush. 
  "The base line of fire is grid azimuth 43-00. 
  "Settings for firing for effect are to be determined by the 
full preparation method. 
  "The artillery battalion is to move up to the fire position 
area in the regimental column over route No 1 (he indicates on 
the map). 
  "During the course of the battle, the artillery battalion is 
to move at full strength to the new fire position area: (exc.) 
Hill 92.0, (exc.) 'Kruglaya' grove, the brush. Relocation is to 
commence after completion of fire against the second successive 
fire concentration line (target 223). The route of relocation 
is... (he indicates it on the map). 
  "5. My orders are: 
  "The 4th Battery is to support the 1st Motorized Rifle 
Company; the 6th Battery is to support the 2d Motorized Rifle 
Company; and the 5th Battery is to be the stand-by battery.

6th Battery--on the southern slope of Hill 88.0; 5th Battery and 
the battalion command and observation posts--on the northern 
slope of Hill 88.0; the radar position is on Hill 88.0. 
  "6. Ammunition expenditure for the day per gun is 210, 
including: 66 for artillery preparation of the assault, 90 for 
artillery support of the assault, and 54 for artillery 
accompaniment. 
  "7. Readiness to open fire is at 0630 hours 18 October. 
  "8. The artillery battalion command and observation post is 
to be here at 1630 hours 17 October. The battalion fire control 
post is to be near the 5th Battery fire position at 0430 hours 
18 October. The direction of relocation of the battalion command 
and observation post is: Hill 88.0, 'Kruglaya' grove, Borki. 
  "In the event the battalion command and observation post is 
knocked out of action, the commander of the 6th Battery is to 
assume command and control of the battalion until the chief of 
staff arrives." 
  The battalion intelligence officer recorded the verbal 
combat 
order. 
  Next the battalion commander clarified the cooperation 
procedures: 
  (a) For the moving up and deployment of the battalion: 
  "The artillery battalion is to move up from the staging area 
under the direction of the chief of staff. During daylight 
hours, study the access routes to the fire position area and the 
area for sheltering the prime movers. By 0400 hours 18 October, 
dispatch one sergeant from each battery to the road intersection 
(he indicates it on the map) to meet the fire platoons. To 
ensure safety in passing through the fire position area by tank 
and motorized rifle subunits, post a soldier with flares on the 
flanks of each battery's fire position. Lay out on the ground 
ammunition to be expended during artillery preparation and 
artillery support of the assault." 
  (b) For carrying out missions during artillery preparation 
of 
the assault: 
  "The laying of guns against target 114 and their loading are 
to be accomplished on the command `Buran' (two-three minutes 
before commencement of artillery preparation). Commence 
artillery preparation on the command `Buran, fire.' On this same 
command, radio operation is without restriction. 
  "In the event communications are disrupted, fire missions 
are 
to be carried out according to the times in the battalion's fire 
plan. 
  "Passages in enemy obstacles are to be cleared by detonation 
and marked by rectangular markers. The artillery battalion is to 
use passage No 3 (he indicates on the terrain) for relocation. 
  "Companies are to deploy into combat formation between 
H-hour 
-:12 and H-hour -:09, reach the final coordination line at 
H-hour -:07, and dismount. Battery commanders are to coordinate 
a meeting with the commanders of supported companies and the 
procedures for joint actions during the course of the offensive. 
  "During the transition from artillery preparation to 
artillery support of the assault, do not permit pauses in the 
delivery of fire." 
  (c) When carrying out missions during artillery support of 
the assault: 
  "At H-hour -:07, on signal `Bars, fire,' the 4th and 6th 
batteries are to continue to fire against target 114 at the same 
rate as during artillery preparation of the assault. The 5th 
Battery is to be ready to neutralize newly detected targets. 
First-echelon companies, negotiating the obstacle passages, are 
to reach the safety limit by H-hour -:04 (he shows it on the 
terrain). At this moment the company and platoon commanders are 
to give a signal with red flares. Stop on my command `Bars.' On 
the command `Volk, fire,' the batteries are to shift fire to the 
second successive fire concentration line against target 223. 
  "Taking advantage of the artillery fire, tank and motorized 
rifle subunits are to attack and seize the enemy strong points. 
The command and observation posts of the 4th and 6th batteries 
are to be relocated together with the company commanders. 
Battery fire during the course of the relocation is to be 
controlled during short halts. 
  "Fire platoons are to relocate to the new fire position area 
on the signal `Motor.' The chief of staff is to dispatch an 
artillery reconnaissance group under the command of the 
commanders of the second fire platoons to select fire positions. 
  "Deploy into combat formation on the signal `Strela.'" 
  (d) For carrying out missions during artillery accompaniment 
of the offensive in depth: 
  "When the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion reaches the line 
`Kruglaya' grove, pit 4, a counterattack by enemy brigade 
reserves is possible from the direction of mound 3, `Kruglaya' 
grove. The battalion is to repel the enemy counterattack in 
cooperation with the 2d Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt (the 
adjacent unit on the left). The antitank reserve is to deploy on 
a line from the bridge to the brush. To repel the counterattack, 
the artillery battalion will prepare concentrated fire against 
target 174, engaging the enemy during the move up and 
deployment, and fixed barrage fire deep in `Pikhta-2,' firing 
against the second line (he indicates it on the map). In the 
event individual tanks or small groups of enemy motorized 
infantry break through to the fire position, destroy them in 
cooperation with the antitank reserve of the 5th Motorized Rifle 
Regiment by direct fire and RPG's. 
  "Target designation signals and procedures are as follows... 
(he clarifies them for the battery commanders). The signal for 
assuming command and control of the battalion in the event the 
battalion command and observation post is knocked out of 
commission is `Zvezda.' The commander of the 6th Battery is to 
have the necessary data on his work map for command and control 
of the battalion." 
  At 1600 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander 
passed the following data to the battalion chief of staff: 
  --The artillery battalion's mission for supporting the 
commitment to battle of the battalion second echelon (target 67, 
x = 17,540, y = 53,320, h = 90, 
frontage 250, depth 200, on-call fire); 
  --During the move up the artillery battalion column will be 
met at the road intersection (1,962). 
  At 1600 hours 17 October, the artillery battalion commander 
organizes reconnaissance of fire weapons in the strong 
points--targets 114 and 223. Special attention is concentrated 
on reconnaissance of all types of fire weapons in the platoon 
stronghold--target 114. 
  The artillery battalion commander and intelligence officer 
summarize the reconnaissance results received from the battery 
commanders, plot the data on a large-scale field map, and 
compare them with reconnaissance reports received from the 1st 
Artillery Battalion of the 19th RAG. Observation in the 
assigned sectors continues with the onset of darkness. Terrain 
in the vicinity of the strong points is illuminated with 
illumination rounds from the 1st Battery from the temporary fire 
position to reconnoiter individual targets at night. 
<H3>  Withdrawal and Deployment of the Artillery Battalion; 
Checking Readiness </H3>
  At 1900 hours 17 October, the chief of staff of the 2d Arty 
Bn, 8th Arty Regt, arrived at the regimental headquarters at the 
staging area, where he received instructions on the order of the 
battalions move up to the fire position area. 
  Based on the instructions received at the regimental 
headquarters and from the artillery battalion commander, the 
chief of staff issued instructions to the battery senior 
officers: 
  "The enemy is defending on the previous line. The artillery 
battalion is to move up to the fire position area in regimental 
column behind the 1st Arty Bn. The head of the column is to pass 
the starting point--the western outskirts of Peski--at 0230 
hours 18 October. Speed of movement is to be 20 km/hr. The 
column alignment will be: 4th, 5th, and 6th batteries; the 
administrative squad; the workshop. The head of the column is to 
reach the edge of the grove along the road by 0210 hours. Only 
parking lights are to be turned on during travel over the route. 
Observers are to be designated on each vehicle. Individual 
protective gear is to be at the ready. I will travel at the head 
of the artillery battalion column. 
  "Range and azimuth settings are to be determined by the full 
preparation method. Corrections are to be computed at grid 
azimuths 43-00 and 48-00 at a range of three, seven, and 11 km 
on the second charge. Computed weather corrections are to be 
received from the fire control post, and computed corrections 
charts are to be made. Coordinates of the fire positions are... 
(he informs them of the coordinates). A table of calculated 
range and azimuth settings is to be prepared in each battery by 
2100 hours. Study the fire control signals." 
  By 2130 hours 17 October, the chief of staff had prepared a 
table of calculated range and azimuth settings at the fire 
control post using the fire control director and computer. By 
this time tables were also prepared in the batteries. 
  At 0400 hours 18 October, the battalion arrived in the area 
of the firing position, where they linked up with the chief of 
the ARG and representatives of each of the batteries. The 
battery occupied its own firing position. 
  At 0430 hours 18 October, the battalion commander arrived at 
the fire control point, heard the Chief of Staff's report on 
measures taken in the battalion in preparation for combat 
operations, studied it, signed off on it and took the firing 
table with him. 
  Next the commander and his deputy for political affairs 
began 
checking the readiness of the 4th and 6th batteries. They 
checked the following: accuracy of lining up of guns on the 
base line; preparation and distribution of apportionment of 
ammunition by shellings at each gun; knowledge of fire missions 
and the order of carrying them out by the senior battery 
officers and gun commanders; the availability of firing data 
sheets for the gun commanders and computed grid and azimuth 
settings for the senior battery officer; the accuracy of 
computing grid and azimuth settings; the operation of landline 
communications and readiness of radios for operation; and the 
degree of engineer preparation of the fire positions.

  The check of readiness of the 5th Battery was accomplished 
by 
the artillery battalion chief of staff. 
  At 0500 hours 18 October, the senior officer of the 5th 
Battery made a calibration firing of a lot of propellant charges 
with the artillery battalion's reference piece (the base piece 
of the 5th Battery) from a temporary fire position of one of the 
batteries of the 19th RAG using the ABS of his artillery 
battalion and reported to the battalion chief of staff: "The 
total muzzle velocity deviation of the rounds for the reference 
piece is +1.2 percent for lot 5-86-79 and +1.3 percent for lot 
5-85-73." 
  The chief of staff relayed these data to the battery 
commanders for updating the computed settings. 
<H5>  Artillery Battalion's Actions During Reconnaissance in Force </H5>
  Reconnaissance in force is conducted on the decision of the 
senior commander to clarify data on the grouping of the enemy 
and his actions, to disclose the fire plan in the defense, to 
verify the enemy's presence on the occupied positions in front 
of our advance, and so forth. Prisoners, models of weapons, 
and documents are captured during the course of reconnaissance 
in force. It can be conducted both in the daytime and at night, 
24 hours or several hours before the start of an offensive. 
Based on experience of the Great Patriotic War, forces from a 
company up to a battalion are assigned to conduct reconnaissance 
in force, and one-two artillery (mortar) battalions are assigned 
to provide fire support. 
  Reconnaissance in force usually begins following a 10- to 
15-minute artillery shelling. If a shelling is not conducted, 
artillery subunits are ready to open fire immediately. 
  The time for conducting reconnaissance in force is limited 
and is about 20-40 minutes. During this time, all personnel of 
the command and observation post conduct reconnaissance of the 
enemy in the assigned zones and sectors, fix the location of 
detected fire weapons, and update existing reconnaissance 
information. 
  The information received is processed at the headquarters in 
the shortest possible time and used to update planned fire 
missions for artillery subunits for artillery preparation and 
artillery support of the assault. Coordinates of targets 
designated for neutralization may be updated, targets may be 
canceled, or others may be designated. 
  The following is based on conditions of the above tactical 
example. 
  At 0520 hours 18 October, the artillery battalion commander 
arrived at the RAG commander's observation post, reported to him 
on the battalion's readiness, and submitted the fire plan, which 
the RAG commander approved. 
  He received instructions from the 5th RAG commander: "At 
0640 
hours 18 October, a motorized rifle company of the defending 
battalion is to conduct reconnaissance in force in the direction 
of Hill 88.0, `Kruglaya' grove. It is to use all assets to 
reconnoiter and clarify the disposition of enemy fire weapons in 
its strongholds--targets 114 and 115, and in the interval 
between them. Report results." 
  The reconnaissance in force began following a five-minute 
shelling by artillery from the 19th RAG. The company's assault, 
which advanced 250-300 meters, was met with enemy submachinegun, 
machinegun, antitank, and mortar fire. The company hit the dirt 
and, subsequently, was withdrawn to the previous positions by 
order of the senior commander. 
  During the course of the reconnaissance in force, the 
coordinates were determined for an ATGM launcher, a tank, two 
machineguns, the trench from which the submachinegun fire was 
coming, and a mortar platoon. The artillery battalion 
intelligence officer plotted this and earlier received 
reconnaissance information on a large-scale field map and 
reported to the artillery commander and the group intelligence 
officer. 
  The artillery battalion commander and the artillery 
battalion 
intelligence officer analyzed the disposition of the enemy 
weapons and came to the following conclusions. The enemy was 
stubbornly defending the occupied positions. The strongholds 
reconnoitered earlier were confirmed. The fire weapons were 
positioned unevenly (Figure 14) in the platoon 
stronghold--target 114. Therefore, to neutralize the stronghold 
during artillery preparation of the assault, it was advisable to 
allocate the target areas among the batteries in the following 
manner: the 4th and 5th batteries would be given the right 
portion of the target, with a frontage of 200 meters and a depth 
of 160 meters; the 6th battery would be given the left portion 
of the target, with a frontage of 130 meters and a depth of 130 
meters. 




    The artillery battalion commander reported the conclusions 
and decision for neutralizing target 114 to the commander of the 
5th RAG, who approved this decision. The artillery battalion 
commander issued the order: "Target 114 is to be neutralized 
with the following allocation of target areas among the 
batteries: 4th and 5th batteries--x = 19,470, 
y = 58,520, frontage 200, depth 160; 6th 
Battery--x = 19,305, y = 58,450, frontage 
130, depth 130; shell expenditure is as previously established 
for each battery during the first and fourth shellings. With the 
start of the first shelling, the intelligence officer is to 
report the deviation of the 6th Battery's first volley against 
target 114." 
<H5>  Conducting Combat Operations </H5>
<H5>  Artillery Preparation and Artillery Support of the Assault </H5>
  The advance by tank and motorized rifle subunits from the 
staging area is preceded by their movement up and deployment 
into combat formation. In order to ensure the simultaneous 
arrival at the final coordination line at the designated time, 
lines are designated for deployment into battalion, company, and 
platoon columns, which are also passed at the established time. 
The enemy may employ weapons of mass destruction, aviation, and 
artillery during the movement up and deployment of our subunits. 
The commander of an artillery battalion that ends up in an area 
affected by weapons of mass destruction immediately clarifies 
the status of the batteries and reconnaissance subunits, takes 
steps to immediately restore the battalion's combat 
effectiveness, and organizes the neutralization of the effects 
of the enemy's employment of weapons of mass destruction. 
Disrupted command and control is restored in the shortest 
possible time in the battalion, and the battalion prepares to 
engage enemy tactical nuclear and chemical offensive weapons, 
artillery batteries, and command and control facilities. These 
fire missions are assigned by the group commander or are carried 
out by the artillery battalion commander on his own initiative. 
  Subunits are warned by means of a prearranged signal about 
the use of retaliatory nuclear strikes against targets located 
in the direct proximity of friendly forces. At this signal, 
personnel of the command and observation posts of the battalion 
and batteries take down the radio antennas, place instruments 
under cover, and go into a shelter or take other protective 
measures. After the nuclear strike has been delivered, personnel 
take their places at the artillery battalion commander's order 
and prepare instruments and radios for combat work. 
  On receipt of H-hour, the artillery battalion commander 
converts the provisional time to astronomical time in the 
battalion fire plan. The chief of staff and battery commanders 
convert the time of delivering fire by shellings usually after 
receiving the command to load against targets of the first 
shelling. 
  The battalion opens fire at the prescribed time at the 
command (signal) of the senior artillery commander (chief) and 
carries out the fire missions in accordance with the fire plan. 
The artillery battalion commander gives commands and prearranged 
signals, observes the results of the fire, adjusts the fire, if 
necessary, and monitors fulfillment of the missions by the 
batteries, striving for effective engagement of the targets. 
Scouts from the batteries and the artillery battalion monitor 
the results of the fire in the assigned sectors and conduct 
reconnaissance of new targets, particularly in the intervals 
between strongholds. The artillery battalion commander, if fire 
capabilities are available, tasks battery commanders to 
neutralize newly reconnoitered targets or reports these targets 
to the senior artillery commander (chief) and to the commander 
of the supported battalion. 
  The following is under the conditions of the tactical 
example 
above. 
  The commander of the 5th RAG informed the commander of the 
2d 
Arty Bn, 8th Arty Regt, that "H-hour" was set at 0840 hours 18 
October. The artillery battalion commander converted the time 
for fire by shellings to astronomical time: 
  --first shelling (from H-hour -0:57 to -0:42)--from 0743 to 
0758; 
  --second shelling (from H-hour -0:42 to -0:32)--from 0758 to 
0808; 
  --third shelling (from H-hour -0:32 to -0:21)--from 0808 to 
0819; 
  --fourth shelling (from H-hour -0:21 to -0:07)--from 0819 to 
0833. 
  --the first successive fire concentration line (from H-hour 
-0:07)--from 0833... 
  Attention should be directed to certain particular features 
of fire control during the periods of artillery preparation and 
artillery support of the assault. The great artillery density, 
the intensity of fire by the pieces, the powerful sound effects 
of guns firing and shells bursting, the dense clouds of dust and 
smoke both in the fire position area and in the vicinity of the 
targets, and the abundance of signals and commands being given 
over the control nets--all these factors create considerable 
difficulties in fire control and command and control of the 
subunits during these periods. Therefore, cohesiveness of 
subunits at all levels, thorough preparation of firing and fire 
control, precise actions of all commanders, and interaction of 
all forces and assets are the basis for stable command and 
control and high effectiveness of artillery fire. 
  In the conditions of the tactical example, during the last 
shelling, as was agreed upon earlier, the commander of the 1st 
Motorized Rifle Battalion arrived in the vicinity of the 
artillery battalion command and observation post to establish 
personal contact with the artillery battalion commander. He 
reported that the battalion was at that time moving up from the 
line of deployment into platoon columns to the final 
coordination line. 
  The artillery battalion commander informed the battalion 
commander that the artillery battalion was continuing to 
neutralize the platoon stronghols--target 114--and when the 
first-echelon companies reached the final coordination line it 
would shift to artillery support of the assault without changing 
the rate of fire against target 114. 
  With the start of the assault, the artillery battalion 
commander and battery commanders continuously monitored the 
enemy's actions, the position of the advancing subunits, and the 
signals of their commanders. On the signal of the commander of 
the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, the artillery battalion 
commander gave the command to shift fire from the first 
successive fire concentration line to the second line, which he 
reported to the commander of the 5th RAG, and jointly with the 
battalion commander, and the commander of the 5th Battery began 
relocating. The command and observation posts of the 4th and 6th 
batteries began relocating simultaneously. 
  At 0852 hours, during the course of relocating, the 
commander 
of the 2d Arty Bn, 8th Arty Regt, and the commander of the 1st 
Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, reached the enemy's first trench 
in the vicinity of target 114. The first-echelon companies 
fought to seize the platoon stronghold, target 223. A mortar 
platoon was firing on the 2d Motorized Rifle Company from an 
area 300 meters south of "Kruglaya" grove. 
  Subunit commanders must know that the most important 
principle of combat is the continuous coordination of artillery, 
tanks, and infantry, on which success of the assault depends. 
Paramount importance was attached to this principle during the 
Great Patriotic War. 
  Here are a few excerpts of articles from the newspaper 
KRASNAYA ZVEZDA dated 30 June 1943 and 19 May 1944.[.sup]1[/] 
  ...In the Red Army's combat experience there are many 
examples of exemplary, extremely thorough and precise 
organization of such coordination. Suffice it to recall just the 
recent fighting at the Sivash, at Perekop, and at Sevastopol, 
where the efforts of large artillery masses, in the full sense 
of the word, merged as one with the efforts of the infantry, 
which ensured an unparalleled high rate of advance under the 
most difficult conditions. Our troops possess rich and diverse 
experience in coordinating artillery and infantry when breaking 
through the enemy defenses. The task is to fully and 
comprehensively take this experience into account, drawing the 
necessary conclusions from it. 
  As is known, the success of an assault on the forward 
edge depends primarily on how skillfully the infantry exploits 
the results of artillery fire. Experience teaches, for example, 
that the beginning of an assault by tanks and infantry after 
conclusion of artillery preparation cannot be delayed in any 
case. The basic rule of coordination of infantry and tanks with 
artillery states: "If you want to achieve success in an 
offensive, press right up close to the artillery fire (of 
course, taking into account a safe distance from friendly shell 
bursts) with each advance, and dash swiftly to assault enemy 
fortifications following friendly artillery shell bursts." 
  When the artillery fires against enemy fortifications, 
the enemy soldiers withdraw to bunkers or lie on the bottom of 
emplacements. Duty observers remain at the exposed machinegun 
and gun emplacements. It is during these moments that the enemy 
is insufficiently prepared to repel our attack. If the attacking 
lines manage to catch the enemy in the shelters, they will 
probably gain victory with little bloodshed. If the attacking 
lines are late or delay in rushing into the attack, the enemy 
soldiers will jump out of the shelters and man the machineguns 
and guns. Then the offensive may bog down. 
  It is difficult to eliminate the consequences of such 
mistakes during combat. Artillery has to return its fire to the 
forward edge, which is not so easy to do, particularly if the 
plan does not call for this. Such shifting of fire is often 
complicated by the spontaneous breaking of the attacking combat 
formation line. In addition, having hit the ground under fire, 
it is difficult for the infantry to get up simultaneously for a 
repeat assault.... 
  Thus, the most important tasks in continuous coordination of 
artillery with infantry and tanks, at the start and in the 
course of an assault are: first, eliminating (preventing) a 
break in time between the end of the artillery preparation and 
the start of the assault by tanks and infantry; second, 
combining into a single whole artillery fire and the movement of 
attacking forces, and fire must precede and support (accompany) 
the movement. 
  Commanders of artillery battalions and batteries must 
relocate the command and observation posts in a timely manner, 
continuously conduct reconnaissance of the enemy, know the exact 
location of supported companies and adjacent subunits, deliver 
fire against targets until the attacking subunits reach the 
safety line, and, depending on the method of artillery support 
of the assault, shift fire at the request (signal) of the 
battalion or regimental commander. 
  As friendly subunits advance deep into the enemy's defense, 
their efforts are directed at carrying out the combat mission as 
quickly as possible. In such conditions it is quite important to 
preserve the earlier established coordination between all the 
subunits participating in the combat. 
  We will show how coordination is maintained in combat based 
on a specific example from the experience of the Great Patriotic 
War.[.sup]2[/] 
  The rifle battalion, having two companies in the first 
echelon, broke through the forward edge of the Nazi defense. 
Supported by tanks and artillery battalion fire, it began to 
develop the offensive into the enemy's rear. Following the 
infantry, regimental mortars and guns neutralized enemy weapon 
positions. 
  But then the right-flank company was halted by heavy 
fire from three machineguns, and it hit the dirt. Th tank 
platoon advancing in front of the company came under fire from 
two Nazi guns from the flanks. Simultaneously, more than a 
company of German infantry went over to a counterattack against 
our left-flank company. Quite a difficult situation developed. 
It was necessary to repel the counterattack, destroy the 
machineguns, and neutralize the antitank guns. 
  Correctly assessing the situation of the left flank as 
being the most threatened, the battalion commander sent 
two-thirds of the tanks there to destroy the counterattacking 
infantry, ordered the artillery battalion commander to carry out 
a short battalion shelling against the infantry, and tasked the 
remaining tanks to destroy the Nazi heavy machineguns. The 
regimental guns and mortars were tasked to destroy the antitank 
guns and support the tanks' maneuver. 
  The decision was executed in a short period of time. 
Enemy resistance was broken, and our infantry's advance resumed. 
This became possible as a result of establishing prearranged 
control and target designation signals and as a result of the 
artillery battalion commander being located next to the 
battalion commander, which made it possible to request the 
artillery battalion fire without delay. 
<H3>  Artillery Accompaniment of the Troop Offensive in the 
Enemy's Rear </H3>
  After defeating the enemy's first-echelon subunits, our 
subunits developed the offensive deep into the enemy's defense. 
The enemy would do everything possible to restore the disrupted 
defense, using the remnants of the defeated subunits to occupy 
pre-prepared strongholds and advantageous positions. 
Considerable intervals and gaps may appear in the enemy's combat 
formations. Resistance by enemy subunits, and in a number of 
cases by individual groups, will prove to be insufficiently 
strong. Therefore, combat in the depth is characterized by 
unevenness in the advance by tanks and motorized rifle subunits, 
by abrupt and frequent changes in the situation, by actions by 
battalions in combat and approach march formations, and by the 
wide maneuver of subunits to bypass strong points. On the axis 
where the enemy's defense has been neutralized by nuclear 
weapons, friendly subunits will advance swiftly deep into, 
reaching the flanks and rear of defending enemy subunits. Small 
enemy groups may remain in the rear area of friendly subunits; 
they are to be destroyed by approaching second echelons or 
reserves. 
  The artillery battalion commander must maintain 
communications with the maneuver battalion commander, and 
battery commanders must do so with company commanders by 
personal contact, which is a most important element of 
maintaining coordination and continuous command and control of 
subunits in combat. Timely relocation of command and observation 
posts will make it possible to know the rapidly changing 
situation, assign additional reconnaissance missions, neutralize 
detected targets in a short period of time and with the least 
expenditure of shells, and take steps for comprehensive support 
of combat operations. 
  With the deployment of the artillery battalion command and 
observation post (stopping of the command vehicle) at each new 
location, the artillery battalion commander must clarify the 
enemy position and the position and missions of the supported 
battalion. He must report the location of the command and 
observation post to the group commander, report the coordinates 
of the command and observation post to the artillery battalion 
staff (regimental fire control post) and the battery commanders, 
clarify the location of the command and observation posts and 
fire platoons of the batteries, determine on the terrain the 
location of scheduled concentrated fire and fixed barrage fire, 
and control fire when engaging newly reconnoitered targets. 
  In these conditions, the intelligence officer immediately 
arranges to determine target coordinates and based on the 
artillery battalion commander's instructions clarifies subunit 
reconnaissance missions and assembles reconnaissance information. 
  The artillery battalion commander, with permission from the 
maneuver battalion commander (if the artillery battalion is 
attached) or the artillery group commander (if the artillery 
battalion is supporting the maneuver battalion), gives the 
signal for the artillery battalion to relocate to the new fire 
position area. 
<H5>  Commitment to Battle of the Second Echelon </H5>
  The maneuver battalion's second echelon is committed to 
battle to exploit the success achieved by the first echelon, to 
expand the breakthrough to the flanks, to repel an enemy 
counterattack, and sometimes also to replace a first-echelon 
company (battalion) that has lost its combat effectiveness. It 
cam be committed to battle in the intervals between companies or 
from behind the flanks of one of the first-echelon companies. 
  The second-echelon company advances to the commitment line 
in 
approach march formation at maximum speed. On approaching the 
commitment line it quickly deploys into combat formation, firing 
from all types of guns, attacks the enemy on the move, and 
carries out the assigned mission. 
  During commitment of the battalion second echelon, the 
commander of the attached (supporting) artillery battalion 
assigns (updates) the mission for reconnoitering the enemy 
forward of the line of commitment of the second echelon, 
attaches a battery to the company or assigns a battery to 
support the second-echelon company, and indicates to the battery 
commander the location and time of meeting with the company 
commander. He assigns (updates) fire missions to the battery 
commanders. 
  The commander of the battery attached to the second-echelon 
company or assigned to support it during commitment to battle, 
after receiving the mission from the artillery battalion 
commander, moves up to the designated place to meet the company 
commander, establishes personal contact with him, receives the 
mission from him, and assigns (updates) the mission for 
reconnoitering the enemy. 
  The commander of an artillery battalion attached to the 
maneuver battalion, or assigned to support it during commitment 
to battle, after receiving the mission from the senior artillery 
commander (chief), updates the missions for reconnoitering the 
enemy forward of the line of commitment, assigns the mission for 
preparing battalion fire, establishes personal contact with the 
maneuver battalion commander, and assigns batteries to support 
the companies. 
  When time is limited for commitment of the second echelon to 
battle, it is advisable to assign the stand-by battery to 
support the company and the stand-by artillery battalion to 
support the maneuver battalion. 
  The artillery battalion that earlier supported the offensive 
of the first-echelon battalion may be assigned to support the 
second-echelon battalion's commitment to battle. Organizing 
fulfillment of the mission by this artillery battalion will 
require more time, since some regrouping of the artillery 
battalion's forces and assets will be required with a change in 
axis. 
  Prior to commitment of the second echelon to battle, the 
artillery battalion neutralizes enemy weapons usually with one 
shelling, which should be long enough to make it possible to 
carry out assigned missions and preclude (sharply reduce) the 
effectiveness of fire from enemy antitank weapons when friendly 
subunits move up to the commitment line. 
  Exercise experience shows that the artillery battalion 
commander, particularly when performing duties as the artillery 
group commander, often has to determine independently the 
duration of the shelling and report it to the regimental 
(battalion) commander. 
  The duration of the shelling may be determined by two 
indicators: 
  --by the time needed to carry out assigned fire missions; 
  --by the time needed to cover the movement of the second 
echelon from the line of effective enemy antitank fire to the 
troop safety line. 
  The procedure for calculating according to the first 
indicator is as follows: 
  --clarify the position of the enemy and the disposition of 
enemy antitank and other weapons on the axis of commitment of 
the second echelon and on the flanks; 
  --determine the fire missions and assign the subunits for 
carrying them out and the ammunition expenditure; 
  --determine the duration of the shelling according to the 
rate of fire and ammunition expenditure for one piece. 
  The procedure for calculating according to the second 
indicator is as follows: 
  --clarify the position of the enemy and the disposition of 
enemy antitank and other weapons on the axis of commitment of 
the second echelon and on the flanks; 
  --clarify the line of commitment of the second echelon; 
  --assess the terrain and determine the line of effective 
enemy antitank fire; 
  --determine the duration of the shelling according to the 
formula: 
  T[.sup]shelling[/] = (D - L)/V 
  where D is the distance to the line of effective enemy 
antitank fire; L is the troop safety line; and V is the rate of 
advance of the second echelon. 




    In the conditions shown in Figure 15 and at V = 15 km/hr: 
  T[.sup]shelling[/] = (D - L)/V = (2300-400)/250 = about 8 
minutes 
  The duration of the shelling is taken from one of the 
largest 
indicators. For example, 10 minutes is required to neutralize 
strongholds and weapons at the position of brigade reserves, and 
eight minutes is required to cover the advance of the regiment's 
second echelon, taking into account the nature of the terrain. 
  Based on the larger indicator, the duration of the shelling 
is taken as equal to 10 minutes. 
  Let us examine the actions of an artillery battalion in 
supporting the commitment of a battalion's second echelon under 
conditions of the tactical example. 
  The commander of the 2d Arty Bn, 8th Arty Regt, together 
with 
the commander of the 1st Bn, 5th Motorized Rifle Regt, located 
500 meters east of the bridge, clarified the situation (see the 
work map, Figure 11). 
  The 1st Motorized Rifle Company with a tank platoon, 
advancing in the direction indicated, reached Upey Brook, where 
it met organized enemy resistance. The company was advancing. 
The commander of the 4th Battery reported: "I am 500 meters 
north of the bridge. The battery is deploying at the new fire 
positions. When ready, I will open fire on the ATGM launcher." 
  The 2d Motorized Rifle Company with a tank company (minus a 
tank platoon) was waging combat in the area south of "Kruglaya" 
grove. The commander of the 6th Battery reported: "I am 400 
meters east of `Kruglaya' grove. The company is engaged in 
difficult fighting." 
  The artillery battalion intelligence officer announced the 
decision: "The 1st and 2d motorized rifle companies are to 
continue carrying out assigned missions; the 3d Motorized Rifle 
Company and the 1st Tank Company (minus a platoon) are to be 
committed to battle from the line of the bridge, the brush in 
the direction of the bridge, and `Kruglaya' grove to exploit the 
success. A mortar battery is attached to the company. Readiness 
is at 0910 hours. With commitment of the 3d Motorized Rifle 
Company, the 2d Motorized Rifle Company is moved into reserve. 
The artillery battalion commander is to support the commitment 
of the 3d Motorized Rifle Company and neutralize the 
reconnoitered enemy weapons." 
  The artillery battalion commander decided: Support the 
commitment of the 3d Motorized Rifle Company and the 1st Tank 
Company (minus a platoon) with concentrated fire by the 5th and 
6th batteries, neutralizing personnel and weapons--target 68; 
determine center coordinates using a rangefinder; prepare 
azimuth and range settings at the fire control post; shelling 
duration is to be seven minutes with a shell expenditure of 
one-fifth the norm. The 4th Battery is to neutralize 
reconnoitered ATGM launchers. He reported the decision to the 
group commander and the 1st Motorized Rifle Battalion commander. 
  In accordance with the decision made, the artillery 
battalion 
commander gave the command: "Visla," "Oka," Halt. Seven-minute 
shelling. Load. Target 68, tanks and armored personnel 
carriers [APC's]. Battalion: 36-85, 3,280, elevation 85. 
Overlapping fire. Two settings of 300 by 100. Expenditure 144 
per battery. This is "Neva." 
  After receiving the report on readiness of the batteries, 
the 
artillery commander reports this to the 1st Motorized Rifle 
Battalion commander, on his signal gives the command to open 
fire, and reports on mission accomplishment to the group 
commander. 
  During the course of the shelling, the 3d Motorized Rifle 
Company and the 1st Tank Company move up to the commitment line, 
after which they go over to the attack. After completion of the 
shelling, the artillery battalion (battery) supports the assault 
and the subsequent actions of the second-echelon subunits with 
concentrated fire and fire against single targets. The artillery 
battalion (battery) may set up a smoke screen to decrease the 
effectiveness of enemy antitank fire. 
<H5>  Repelling Enemy Counterattacks </H5>
  During combat deep in the enemy defense, subunits must be 
constantly ready to repel counterattacks by enemy brigade and 
divisional reserves. A motorized rifle battalion can repel a 
counterattack by enemy forces of superior, equal, or lesser 
strength. 
  When repelling a counterattack by small forces, such as a 
motorized infantry company with tanks, battalion subunits defeat 
them with fire and a swift moving attack. 
  When the main portion of enemy counterattacking forces 
operate against an adjacent unit and a smaller portion operate 
against one of the companies of the supported battalion, small 
forces and assets are assigned to repel the counterattack. They 
engage the enemy with stationary fire in cooperation with the 
adjacent unit, and the battalion's main forces continue the 
offensive. 
  When repelling a counterattack by an enemy equal in 
strength, 
the battalion uses part of its forces to engage the enemy with 
fire from an advantageous line, and the rest of the forces 
decisively attack the enemy's flank independently or in 
cooperation with adjacent subunits. 
  A battalion repels a counterattack by enemy forces equal in 
strength by fire from all weapons from an advantageous line in 
cooperation with adjacent units. 
  When moving up for a counterattack, the enemy uses terrain 
irregularities, darkness, and unfavorable weather conditions; it 
also uses smoke screens for cover. In this connection, the 
artillery battalion commander directs the efforts of battalion 
and battery reconnaissance at disclosing enemy intentions and 
the nature of his actions and at detecting the advance of his 
reserves. To repel a counterattack, the artillery battalion 
commander must clarify the decision of the supported battalion 
commander and prepare the artillery battalion in a timely 
manner. If the artillery battalion relocates to a different fire 
position area, it must deploy immediately in the area in which 
the command was received. 
  On detecting advancing enemy reserves (columns), the 
artillery battalion commander reports to the senior artillery 
commander (chief) and the commander of the supported battalion 
(regiment) and engages the advancing enemy with concentrated 
fire. As the enemy gets closer and his columns break down into 
smaller columns, the artillery battalion commander tasks the 
battery commanders to engage individual groups of tanks and 
APC's. Subsequently, the artillery battalion repels the 
counterattack by enemy tanks and infantry by a creeping or fixed 
barrage in cooperation with the weapons of the companies and 
battalion. 
  The Great Patriotic War provided numerous examples of 
successful joint operation of rifle, tank, and artillery 
subunits to repel enemy counterattacks. Here is one these 
examples.[.sup]3[/] 




    In early September 1943, Nazi units being pursued by 
our troops were withdrawing toward the Dnieper (Figure 16). They 
offered stubborn resistance at intermediate positions. 
  The 11th Motorized Rifle Brigade seized the city of 
Trostyanets, Sumy Oblast, on the move, intercepting the highways 
over which enemy troop movement and supply was accomplished. The 
artillery battalion of this brigade deployed into combat 
formation east of Trostyanets, prepared concentrated and fixed 
barrage fire against the roads leading to the city. Taking into 
account the presence of isolated enemy tank and infantry 
subunits in the rear of our units, the artillery battalion 
commander took steps to organize a perimeter defense of the fire 
positions. 
  With the onset of dawn, the enemy made an attempt to 
retake the city. However, his counterattack was repelled by the 
organized use of all weapons. Then the attempt to take the city 
was repeated. Nine enemy tanks with infantry mounted broke 
through from the flank and entered the rear area of the 
motorized rifle battalion. There was a threat that they would 
break through to the fire position area. These tanks were 
detected in time by reconnaissance, and the artillery battalion 
quickly prepared to repel their attack. Only two guns of the 2d 
Battery, located camouflaged in a sunflower field to the right 
of the other batteries, were ordered to open fire. Moving along 
a hollow, the tanks approached the artillery battalion's 
concealed fire positions. Two heavy Tiger tanks came out into 
the open 600 meters from the 2d Battery guns. The gun crew of 
Senior Sergeant Belyakov opened fire and knocked out one tank 
with the second round. The second gun of Senior Sergeant 
Miroshnik knocked out the other tank. The crew of the first tank 
that was knocked out attempted to escape by running, but was 
captured. An ober-lieutenant, the commander of an infantry 
battalion, turned out to be among the prisoners. He gave 
valuable information about the Nazis intentions. Having lost 
two tanks and some infantry, the enemy halted the counterattack 
and withdrew to the attack position. 
  In modern conditions, the enemy usually will counterattack 
with forces of one or two tank-battalion tactical groups. 
Movement forward of these forces will be accomplished at a fast 
pace. Motorized infantry will follow on combat vehicles or 
APC's. Deployment into combat formation and turning into a 
counterattack are accomplished while on the move following an 
artillery shelling and air strikes. 
  The capabilities of our troops for repelling counterattacks 
have increased considerably. Aerial and ground reconnaissance 
assets should be used for timely detection of the moving up and 
deployment of the counterattacking enemy. This gives our 
subunits an opportunity to prepare better to repel the 
counterattack. Artillery subunits, if they have changed 
position, deploy into combat formation, and fire (concentrated 
fire, creeping barrage, or fixed barrage) is adjusted or 
prepared for them. 
  The counterattack is repelled by the coordinated fire of 
artillery, mortars, tanks, ATGM mounts, rocket launchers, and 
IFV's (APC's). Additional subunits are sent to reinforce the 
subunits on threatened sectors, and the antitank reserve is 
moved up. Batteries deployed at indirect-fire positions prepare 
to destroy enemy tanks in the event they break through into the 
rear. 
<H5>  Pursuit of the Enemy </H5>
  Pursuit is an offensive action against a withdrawing enemy, 
the purpose of which is to complete the route of the enemy and 
prevent the enemy's organized transition to a defense on a 
favorable line (intermediate defensive positions) in the rear. 
It is characterized by swiftness and intensity of actions of the 
participating subunits and units and a fight to reach the flanks 
and rear of the withdrawing enemy. 
  Based on the experience of the Great Patriotic War, pursuit 
may occur during forced withdrawal of the enemy as a result of 
the successful development of an offensive by our troops or an 
engagement, and also in the event of a planned withdrawal by the 
enemy to avoid a strike or threat of encirclement. 
  A motorized rifle battalion, using high off-road capability, 
swiftly outflanks the enemy along a parallel route, comes out on 
the path of his withdrawal, and destroys him with a decisive 
attack to the flank and rear in cooperation with adjacent 
subunits. 
  When it is impossible to outflank the enemy along a parallel 
route, the battalion destroys the covering-force subunits, 
breaks through to the enemy main body, and attacks it on the 
move. A battalion may pursue an enemy in combat or 
approach-march formation. With a swift enemy withdrawal, pursuit 
is accomplished in march formation with a reinforced advance 
party sent out from the battalion. 
  During the withdrawal of the main body, the enemy assigns 
forces and assets covering the main body to conduct delaying 
actions. The enemy may use the following methods of delaying 
action: counterattacks, ambushes, surprise raids, diversionary 
attacks, and the holding of a prepared line with insignificant 
forces, inflicting maximum losses on our subunits and thus 
reducing the momentum of the pursuit. 
  The enemy subunits conducting the delaying actions will be 
destroyed, as a rule, by the advance party. If these forces are 
insufficient, the battalion will quickly deploy into combat 
formation, attack and destroy on the move, and continue the 
pursuit. 
  During pursuit, an artillery battalion, especially 
self-propelled artillery, is attached to the first-echelon 
motorized rifle battalion. The artillery battalion commander 
dispatches an artillery reconnaissance subunit together with the 
maneuver battalion's reconnaissance, assigns missions to the 
batteries, and monitors timely displacement of the batteries. 
  Concentrated fire, barrage fire, and engagement of single 
targets are the primary types of artillery battalion fire during 
pursuit. 
  The mobile nature of combat actions and rapid, abrupt 
changes 
in the situation will cause frequent relocations and deployments 
of batteries into combat formation. In these conditions, the 
artillery battalion commander must maintain uninterrupted 
cooperation between artillery and combined-arms subunits. 
Missions will often be assigned to battery commanders based on 
the map while in movement. 
  To reduce time, fire positions are usually occupied near 
roads, despite the inconvenience of the terrain. Fire platoons 
must constantly be ready to conduct direct fire. When carrying 
out assigned missions, battery commanders must display clever 
initiative to increase the effectiveness of engaging various 
targets. In order to inflict the maximum losses on the enemy and 
prevent the approach of his reserves, fire is prepared against 
road junctions, chokepoints, crossings, bridges, and other 
vulnerable objectives (targets). 
  We will show the actions of an artillery battalion during 
pursuit based on experience of the Great Patriotic War (Figure 
17).[.sup]4[/] 




    In August-September 1943, following stubborn fighting 
in the vicinity of Kharkov, our troops were pursuing enemy units 
withdrawing toward Poltava. Saddling the railroad, the enemy 
sought to evacuate valuable property from Artemovka and 
Kochubeyevka stations before the arrival of our troops. On the 
morning of 18 September, the Nazi command authorities moved up 
an infantry regiment with 13 tanks to this area, with the 
mission of delaying our troops on this axis, if only for 24 
hours. 
  An artillery battalion consisting of two howitzer 
batteries and one gun battery was attached to a rifle regiment 
that was pursuing the withdrawing enemy. On the morning of 18 
September, the rifle regiment reached the vicinity of Pokrovka, 
where it encountered stubborn enemy resistance on the line Hill 
188.7, Pokrovka. The Nazis, with a strength of up to two 
companies of infantry with tanks, twice counterattacked, trying 
at any price to stop our advance. However, the counterattacks 
were successfully repelled by the fire of the infantry and the 
artillery battalion, resulting in great losses for the 
enemy. 
  On the night of 18-19 September, our reconnaissance 
ascertained the withdrawal of the enemy from the occupied line 
in a southwesterly direction. Having organized reconnaissance 
and security, the rifle regiment began pursuit of the enemy at 
0400 hours 19 September along the route Pokrovka, Pashchenovks, 
Surdovka, Stepanovka. The artillery battalion followed the 
regiment on towing vehicles, leapfrogging by batteries, not 
lagging more than 1-1.5 km behind the infantry, having its 
mounted reconnaissance patrol in the advance party. 
  Despite the heavy fog, at 0800 hours 19 September the 
artillery scouts detected an enemy column entering 
Shevchenkovskiy Sovkhoz from the direction of Stepanovka. Our 
rifle regiment immediately deployed and joined battle. The 
artillery battalion also rapidly deployed into combat formation. 
The observation post on Hill 180.6 and the forward observation 
posts were moved up into the combat formations of the rifle 
companies. The two howitzer batteries stopped at indirect-fire 
positions in the vicinity of K. (a well), and the gun battery 
took up a direct-fire position in the vicinity of Hill 180.6 in 
the combat formations of the rifle companies. The artillery 
battalion commander maintained communications with the battery 
commanders and fire platoons by telephone and radio. 
  At readiness, the 5th and 6th batteries carried out a 
five-minute shelling against the enemy in Shevchenkovskiy 
Sovkhoz, where he was concentrating infantry and tanks. They 
destroyed one enemy tank and some of his infantry. But soon the 
Nazis attacked our infantry with a force of up to a battalion of 
infantry with 12 tanks. The howitzer batteries immediately 
opened fire, trying to cut off the enemy from the tanks. The gun 
battery, allowing the tanks to approach to within 200-300 
meters, opened direct fire against them. The 4th Battery 
destroyed two tanks and knocked out one with the first shots. 
The rest of the tanks could not withstand the fire of our guns 
and began to withdraw, leaving the scattered infantry, who had 
come under the fire of our guns and their own tanks, without 
support. When our ground attack aircraft appeared in the air, 
the enemy's panic increased even more. 
  Taking advantage of the enemy's confusion, the subunits 
of our rifle regiment counterattacked and seized Shevchenkovskiy 
Sovkhoz and Hill 164.8. In doing so, the guns of the 4th 
Battery, located in the combat formations of the rifle 
companies, delivered direct fire, supporting consolidation of 
the occupied line. Our tanks arrived shortly thereafter. The 
artillery battalion carried out a five-minute shelling against 
the enemy trying to take up a defense north of Stepanovka. Our 
subunits, supported by the fire of the artillery battalion, went 
over to the attack and threw the enemy back to Stepanovka. On 
this line the enemy lost another four tanks, eight machineguns, 
and a large number of personnel and was forced to pull back. Our 
infantry and tanks, supported by the fire of the artillery 
battalion, continued the successful pursuit. 
  The artillery battalion successfully supported the 
rifle regiment during pursuit of the enemy. Reconnaissance was 
well organized, enabling the artillery battalion commander to 
skillfully and rapidly deploy the artillery battalion and timely 
support the regiment's subunits with fire throughout the 
fighting. The artillery battalion commander's decision to use 
the gun battery from direct-fire positions merits attention. All 
batteries cooperated with the infantry, which ensured timeliness 
and continuity of fire support and its effectiveness, which is 
indicated by the considerable enemy losses (particularly in 
tanks) and the minimal losses of our troops. Despite the 
fast-moving nature of the combat actions, the artillery 
battalion commander did not lose command and control of the 
batteries, which was ensured by well-organized 
communications. 
<H5>  Forced Crossing of a Water Obstacle </H5>
  Water obstacles are natural obstacles for advancing 
subunits. 
They are characterized by width; depth; current velocity; the 
nature of the banks, bottom, and valley; the presence of fords 
and water engineering structures; and also the weather 
conditions and the time of the year. 
  Depending on the combat situation conditions, forced 
crossings of water obstacles can be accomplished in a hasty 
crossing or with deployment of the main body at the water 
obstacle after additional preparation over short time periods. 
  A hasty crossing of water obstacles is the primary method. 
It 
is usually used during the course of successful development of 
an offensive or pursuit in the depth of the defense, which is 
confirmed by the experience of the Great Patriotic War. The use 
of nuclear weapons in modern combat, the presence of amphibious 
APC's, IFV's, and other combat equipment in the inventory of 
combined-arms subunits, and also the use of assault-crossing 
equipment--all this creates favorable conditions for hasty 
crossing of water obstacles. 
  A slower crossing by the main body is conducted in those 
instances when a hasty crossing cannot be made due to heavy 
enemy resistance. Subunits conduct the necessary preparations 
prior to the crossing. 
  In any method of forced crossing, artillery subunits cross 
on 
self-propelled assault crossing equipment, on ferries, over a 
captured or launched bridge, or by fording, and self-propelled 
artillery guns are floated across. 
  Prime movers, guns, and motor vehicles are usually loaded 
aboard assault crossing equipment on the bank of the water 
obstacle. The loading is supervised by gun, squad, and platoon 
commanders, observing safety measures. During the loading they 
follow the instructions of the assault crossing equipment 
subunit commanders. 
  When fording a water obstacle, artillery subunit commanders 
organize reconnaissance of the condition of the bottom and 
determine possibilities of descending from the bank and emerging 
on the opposite bank, the current velocity, and the depth of the 
ford. In doing so, they take into account the maximum 
permissible fording depth for a given type of transport 
depending on the river's current velocity (Table 14). Mistakes 
in determining the depth of the ford and the condition of the 
bottom of the water obstacle can not only slow down but also 
disrupt the crossing of artillery subunits. Reserve prime movers 
with lines are assigned for pulling out or towing stuck weapons 
and stalled vehicles and equipment or for assisting them in 
getting out on the opposite bank.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  In anticipation of a hasty crossing of a water obstacle, an 
artillery battalion that is part of the forward detachment 
(advance guard) proceeds closer to the head of the column; if it 
is part of the main body, it proceeds after the advance guard at 
the head of the main body column. 
  Firing on the enemy, the artillery battalion supports the 
approach of the forward detachment (advance guard) to the water 
obstacle, their capture of water engineering structures, 
bridges, and fords, the crossing of a water obstacle by 
subunits, and the attack on the opposite bank. 
  The artillery battalion commander organizes combat actions 
based on the mission received from the forward detachment 
(advance guard) commander on the map during the approach to the 
water obstacle. As a rule, the time for preparing the artillery 
battalion to support the crossing is limited. 
  In clarifying the mission and estimating the situation, the 
artillery battalion commander must understand the forward 
detachment (advance guard) commander's concept and the artillery 
battalion's mission; he must clarify the time, place, and means 
of the artillery battalion's crossing, the nature of the water 
obstacle, and the conditions of the terrain in front of the 
obstacle and on the opposite bank; he must also take into 
account other factors affecting the artillery battalion's 
actions. As a result of this, the artillery battalion commander 
plans reconnaissance missions, locations of command observation 
posts and fire positions, and the fire missions for the 
battalion and batteries from the map. 
  Then the artillery battalion commander organizes 
reconnaissance of the enemy and the terrain, assigns fire 
missions to the battery commanders, and determines the order and 
place of their crossing. The artillery battalion deploys into 
combat formation as it approaches the water obstacle. 
  A radar and helicopter crew attached to the artillery 
battalion may be used for reconnaissance of enemy artillery and 
mortar batteries. 
  The artillery battalion commander assigns missions to the 
batteries by field instructions, personally or by radio. The 
field instruction may indicate the latest information on the 
enemy, the mission of the forward detachment (advance guard), 
brief information on the water obstacle in the assault crossing 
sector, battery fire missions, planned sites of command and 
observation posts and fire positions, and also the base line of 
fire. Assigned missions are updated and supplemented on arrival 
at the water obstacle based on new reconnaissance information. 
  A portion of the guns or a full-strength battery may be 
assigned for direct fire against targets on the opposite bank by 
decision of the forward detachment (advance guard) commander. 
Such a necessity is confirmed by experience of the Great 
Patriotic War. 
  Artillery preparation of an assault crossing and attack is 
usually accomplished by one shelling against enemy personnel and 
weapons on the opposite bank, and also against his artillery and 
mortar batteries. The duration of the shelling, as a rule, is 
determined by the artillery battalion commander depending on the 
scope of the fire missions, the width of the water obstacle, and 
the range of enemy antitank weapons, taking into account the 
nature of the terrain and the speed of crossing equipment for 
covering this distance over land and on water during the 
crossing. Tanks, guns, and other weapons deployed on the 
friendly bank also participate in the shelling. The shelling 
begins no later than when the first-echelon subunits reach the 
limit of the zone of effective range of enemy antitank weapons. 
  During an assault crossing, the artillery battalion 
neutralizes weapons impeding the crossing and observation posts 
or blinds them with smoke projectiles, covers the flanks of 
subunits that have crossed by laying smoke screens, and blocks 
the approach of enemy reserves. 
  The artillery battalion supports the attack by subunits on 
the opposite bank with concentrated fire or battery fire against 
individual targets. It should be kept in mind that during 
artillery support of an assault crossing and attack, fire is 
delivered against targets located, as a rule, in the immediate 
proximity of motorized rifle subunits. This circumstance 
increases the responsibility of the artillery battalion 
commander and battery commanders for accuracy in preparing fire 
and for continuous fire control. 
  The artillery battalion (battery) forward observation post 
may cross with forward subunits for continuous fire control. 
Battery commanders cross to the opposite bank simultaneously 
with the commanders of supported companies; the artillery 
battalion commander crosses with the commander of the forward 
detachment (advance guard). 
  The artillery battalion usually crosses to the opposite bank 
by batteries on self-propelled assault crossing equipment, which 
ensures continuous support of the subunits that have crossed 
with fire from most of the batteries. The beginning of the 
crossing of fire platoons is determined by friendly subunits' 
capture of a line which will prevent the enemy from delivering 
fire from small-arms and antitank weapons against assault 
crossing equipment. Artillery subunits that are part of the main 
body are also used, as they become ready to open fire, for 
artillery preparation and support of the crossing and attack by 
the forward detachment (advance guard). 
  Let us examine the organization of an artillery battalion's 
actions during a hasty crossing of a water obstacle. 
<H6>  Tactical Example 2 </H6>
  Having routed the enemy in the forward defensive area, our 
units were in pursuit toward the northwest. 
  The enemy was exerting efforts to halt the advance of our 
units, hastily creating a defense on tactically advantageous 
lines. 
  The 3d Motorized Rifle Bn with a tank company, an artillery 
battalion of 122-mm self-propelled howitzers, and a subunit of 
assault river-crossing equipment, comprising the advance guard, 
was conducting parallel pursuit of the enemy along the route 
Vishki, Doltsovo, Grebni (Figure 18), tasked to ensure unimpeded 
movement of the main body over this route, destroy the enemy on 
the approaches to Podleyka River, make a forced crossing of the 
river in the sector "Krug" Grove, Zhodino, seize the line "Krug" 
Grove, Lipki, Zhodino, and support the forced crossing of the 
river by the main body. 
  By the start of the pursuit, the batteries had been 
distributed to support the companies: 2d Battery in support of 
the 8th Motorized Rifle Company; 3d Battery in support of the 
9th Motorized Rifle Company. 
  The advance party (7th Motorized Rifle Company with a tank 
platoon and the 1st Battery), destroying small groups of enemy 
infantry (ambush parties) in its path, by 1630 hours on 25 July 
had reached the bank of the Podleyka River, where it encountered 
fire from three APC's and two ATGM's from the opposite bank. The 
1st Battery deployed into combat formation and opened fire to 
neutralize the detected targets. At this same time, the 
artillery battalion's intelligence officer, with a group of 
scouts, deployed the observation post, conducted surveillance of 
the enemy in ROV-1 [area of special interest], and studied the 
condition of the river and its banks. 
  At 1725 hours, the commander of the advance guard made the 
decision to make a forced crossing of the Podleyka River and 
assigned combat missions to the subunits, which called for the 
8th and 9th motorized rifle companies, after the shelling, to 
make a hasty crossing of Podleyka River, destroy the enemy on 
the opposite bank, and carry out the battalion's assigned 
mission. The 7th Motorized Rifle Company was to be the battalion 
reserve; preparation of the companies for the forced crossing 
was to be conducted at the places... (see map). An artillery 
battalion, a mortar battery, the 7th Motorized Rifle Company 
with direct fire from IFV's, and its attached tanks were to 
participate in the shelling. The time for the crossing was to be 
1800 hours on 25 July. An assault crossing point using six 
amphibious carriers (PTS's) and a raft and a ferry crossing 
point consisting of two tracked self-propelled ferries (GSP's) 
were set up in the crossing sector. 




    In accordance with the decision of the advance guard 
commander, while still approaching the water obstacle, the 
artillery battalion commander had issued an order for the 2d and 
3d Batteries to deploy into combat formation and for the ARSOM 
[mortar detection artillery station] radar attached to the 
artillery battalion to take up its position. 
  After arriving at Hill "Dynya," the artillery battalion 
commander received a report from the battalion's intelligence 
officer: "The withdrawing enemy units are taking up a hasty 
defense 150-200 meters from the opposite bank. Three APC's, two 
ATGM's, weapons in trenches, a mortar platoon beyond Hill 61.4, 
and an observation post (he points it out on the terrain) have 
been reconnoitered. Three tanks have been observed moving toward 
Hill 53.7. The ATGM near the dark bushes has been neutralized by 
fire from the 1st Battery. Reconnaissance continues." 
  The artillery battalion commander detailed the intelligence 
officer's mission for conducting reconnaissance of the enemy 
directly in the crossing sector and ordered him to assign by 
radio the missions for reconnaissance of batteries: to the radar 
chief--in ROV-1; to the crew of the attached helicopter--in 
ROV-2. 
  When assessing the situation, the artillery commander 
obtained detailed information on the water obstacle: it was 
190-200 meters wide at the crossing sector, had a current 
velocity of 0.8 meters per second, and was 5-6 meters deep. 
There were individual marshy areas on the opposite bank. In 
addition, he determined the safety limit from our shellbursts, 
the duration of the shelling, and the artillery battalion's fire 
capabilities. 
  The safety limit from our shellbursts was 400 meters at a 
river width of 200 meters and with the closest targets 150-200 
meters from the opposite bank. It ran near the water's edge on 
our bank. 
  The duration of the shelling to cover the advance of 
motorized rifle companies from the line of effective enemy 
antitank fire on this terrain (2,200 meters) to the water line 
(the safety limit) at a speed of 10 km per hour would be: 
  Time of shelling = (2200-400)/167 = 11 minutes 
  Taking into account losses, the artillery battalion had 16 
self-propelled howitzers, 15 motor vehicles, and 0.8 basic loads 
(1,024 rounds). 
  It was advisable to expend up to 0.4 basic loads (521 
rounds) 
in the shelling, taking into account the need to support 
subunits on the opposite bank after their crossing. With an 
expenditure of rounds of 0.5 the norm for each target, the 
artillery battalion would be able to neutralize simultaneously 
one towed-artillery battery (mortar platoon) and up to six 
individual targets or a platoon stronghold on an area up to four 
hectares and two individual targets. 
  The artillery battalion commander decided during the 
11-minute shelling by the battalion and mortar battery to 
neutralize target 31--personnel and weapons, with a frontage of 
250 and a depth of 150; target 81--the mortar platoon; target 
33--the observation post. The expenditure was to be 0.5 the 
norm. The remaining targets were to be destroyed by IFV's and 
tanks using direct fire. 
  During the course of artillery support of the assault 
crossing and attack, with the arrival of the 8th and 9th 
motorized rifle companies at the water line, they were to 
continue to neutralize target 31 and be ready to neutralize 
newly detected targets, particularly antitank targets. 
  To prevent a possible enemy counterattack and approach from 
the direction of "Temnaya" Grove, Hill 53.7, a fixed barrage 
"Akatsiya" was prepared. 
  The chief of staff was to accomplish allocation of targets. 
  The planned order of the artillery battalion's crossing was: 
the command and observation posts of the batteries and the 
artillery battalion on command vehicles--afloat simultaneously 
with the vehicles of the commanders of supported subunits; 
battery gun platoons--afloat in the following sequence--2d, 3d, 
and 1st Batteries; the start of relocation--when the maneuver 
battalion seizes the line of the bend in the highway, the single 
house; subsequently--when the first battery to cross is ready to 
open fire. The motor vehicles of the batteries and the artillery 
battalion were to make the crossing on assault crossing 
equipment. The chief of staff was to perform a calculation of 
the crossing. 
  The fire position area after the crossing... (see map). 
  The artillery battalion commander reported to the maneuver 
battalion commander the duration, start, and end of the 
shelling, the targets to be neutralized by fire from 
indirect-fire positions and by direct fire, and the planned 
order of the crossing of the artillery battalion. He also 
pointed out on the terrain the safety limit from our shellbursts. 
  The maneuver battalion commander approved the artillery 
battalion commander's decision and pointed out to him that six 
PTS's were to be assigned for the crossing of the artillery 
battalion's motor transport at approximately H-hour + 0:30. 
  By this time, the chief of staff had reported to the 
artillery battalion commander the allocation of targets for the 
shelling (Table 15).

  The artillery battalion commander approved the target 
allocation, issued instructions on the order of the artillery 
battalion's crossing, and for preparing fire gave the command: 
"`Don' (the artillery battalion's callsign). Attention. Record. 
Shelling 11 minutes. Readiness at 1745 hours. `Volga' (1st 
Battery). Target 33, an observation post: x=21,440, 
y = 44,120, elevation 50, expenditure 72. `Kama' 
(2d Battery). Target 81, a mortar platoon: x = 
22,540, y = 43,540, elevation 50, expenditure 180. 
`Dnepr' (3d Battery). Target 31, infantry under cover: 
x = 21,320, y = 43,470, elevation 50, 
expenditure 180. This is `Don.'" 
  The battalion commander updated the codenames of local 
features and reference points for the company and attached 
subunit commanders, indicated the sequence of subunit actions 
during the river crossing, announced the signal for beginning 
the shelling, and assigned missions to engage targets by direct 
fire. 
  Based on the artillery battalion commander's instructions, 
the chief of staff plotted on the map the area of the new 
observation posts on the opposite bank, marked each battery's 
fire position, and began calculating the artillery battalion's 
crossing in the following sequence: 
  1. When crossing the batteries' self-propelled howitzers 
afloat: 
  --he determined the crossing sequence (according to the 
artillery battalion commander's decision--the 2d, 3d, and 1st 
Batteries). 
  --he determined the time for crossing the 2d Battery, which 
consisted of the time for moving up to the river, preparing the 
guns for the crossing, crossing the river, and preparing the 
guns for firing and moving to the new fire position. He 
determined the time for crossing the 3d Battery and then the 1st 
Battery. 
  --he determined the total time for crossing the artillery 
battalion with its continuous relocation (the next battery 
begins crossing when the battery that crossed earlier is ready 
for firing). 
  2. When crossing the artillery battalion's motor vehicles: 
  --he counted up the total number of motor vehicles to be 
crossed: the 1st, 2d, and 3d Batteries--three each; the 
artillery battalion headquarters and supply squad--six, for a 
total of 15. 
  --he determined the capabilities of the allocated six PTS's 
for crossing in one crossing: at a rate of one motor vehicle per 
PTS, the capability was six motor vehicles. 
  --he determined the duration of one crossing according to 
Table 16: the river was 200 meters wide, had a current of up to 
1 meter per second, and a PTS required 10 minutes without a 
trailer. 
  He determined the number of crossings and the time for 
crossing each subunit (Table 17).

  Note: The total time for the crossing consists of the time 
for moving the motor vehicle up to the crossing, for crossing, 
and for moving from the bank to the new fire position area. 
  During the course of the Great Patriotic War, our units made 
assault crossings of a large number of wide and narrow rivers 
and canals. Despite the lack of the required amount of assault 
river-crossing equipment at that time, hasty crossing of water 
obstacles was employed quite extensively. 
  Crossing equipment often was made immediately before the 
crossing using local materials, which considerably increased the 
time for preparing the crossing. Characteristic features of a 
hasty crossing are the lack of an organized defense on the 
friendly bank; organization of the crossing in a relatively 
short time period; capture of the opposite bank by a forward 
detachment, advance guard, or first-echelon battalion, that is, 
by small forces; and a stubborn, desperate struggle with the 
enemy to hold the captured sector on the opposite bank until the 
main forces have crossed. 
  In anticipation of a deliberate crossing, an artillery 
battalion may operate as part of an artillery group (assigned to 
support a first-echelon motorized rifle battalion) or be a 
standby battalion. Sometimes it is attached to a first-echelon 
battalion. 
  When preparing combat operations, the artillery battalion 
commander must gain a clear understanding of the combat mission 
of the combined-arms unit (subunit), the mission of the 
artillery battalion, the time and order of crossing the 
artillery battalion, the amount of assigned assault 
river-crossing equipment, the order for moving subunits up to 
the crossing, and the places for loading and unloading guns, 
prime movers, and motor vehicles. 
  Additional reconnaissance missions prior to starting the 
crossing may be: updating information about the water obstacle; 
reconnaissance of the route of advance to the crossing and of 
the terrain in the vicinity of the crossing. 
  When assigning missions, the artillery battalion commander 
also indicates the following: the order of the crossing and the 
battalion's forming-up place prior to the crossing; the order of 
crossing of the artillery battalion and battery command and 
observation posts; the places, time, and the sequence of 
crossing gun platoons and the fire control post to the opposite 
bank. 
  The timetable for the artillery battalion's crossing of a 
water obstacle may come to the artillery battalion from the 
group staff or be drawn up by the artillery battalion commander 
or chief of staff in accordance with directions received. 
  The assault crossing of the water obstacle is preceded by 
artillery preparation of the assault crossing and the attack. In 
participating in the preparation, the artillery battalion 
neutralizes personnel and weapons in strong points, antitank 
weapons, command posts, artillery batteries, mortar platoons, 
and other enemy targets on the opposite bank. First-echelon 
subunits begin crossing the water obstacle at the designated 
time (H-hour), with fire support from artillery and other 
weapons, and occupy the section of terrain on the opposite bank. 
  The artillery battalion shifts from artillery preparation to 
artillery support of the assault crossing and attack. The 
command and observation posts of the batteries and artillery 
battalion cross after the strongholds on the opposite bank have 
been seized. The artillery battalion commander gives commands 
(signals) for the crossing of gun platoons in accordance with 
the crossing timetable. 
  The gun platoons that have crossed immediately deploy at 
fire 
positions in the designated area and, on the command of the 
artillery battalion (battery) commander, open fire to engage 
reconnoitered enemy targets. After all batteries have crossed, 
the artillery battalion operate the same as it would when 
advancing in normal conditions. 
<H3>  Features of Conducting Combat Operations Under Various 
Conditions </H3>
<H5>  Operations at Night </H5>
  Under today's conditions, combat operations will be 
conducted 
with unremitting intensity both day and night. The artillery 
battalion commander and battery commanders have to consider the 
effect of night on the actions of personnel, know the particular 
features of combat operations of combined-arms and artillery 
subunits, and take steps ensuring fulfillment of assigned 
missions. 
  The night sharply reduces visibility, decreases the 
effectiveness of all types of fire, and makes the maneuver of 
forces and weapons more difficult. On the one hand, night 
operations intensify the surprise factor, intensify the effect 
on enemy morale, and improve conditions for camouflage against 
ground and air surveillance. On the other hand, night operations 
degrade the effectiveness of reconnaissance assets, reduce the 
accuracy of fire, and make fire control more difficult. 
  Experience shows that a high degree of proficiency of 
subunits, personnel training to perform their duties, and the 
ability of platoon, battery, and artillery battalion commanders 
to orient themselves quickly in the situation, and on the 
terrain, and to control their subunits precisely, ensure 
successful accomplishment of assigned night missions. 
  An offensive at night may begin with a breakthrough of enemy 
defenses or be a continuation of daytime combat operations. The 
maneuver battalion's combat formation may be aligned in one 
echelon with assignment of a reserve, which moves a shorter 
distance than during daylight. Artillery and mortar subunits are 
attached to motorized rifle subunits to achieve greater 
independence and coordination of actions. Weapons remaining 
directly subordinate to the maneuver battalion commander proceed 
behind the combat formations of first-echelon companies, in the 
intervals, or on their flanks. 
  In addition to carrying out the usual missions for fire 
engagement of the enemy, the artillery battalion (battery) in an 
offensive at night performs missions of illumination support of 
the operations of motorized rifle and tank subunits and 
artillery fire, and missions for destroying or obscuring enemy 
night-vision devices, illumination equipment, and weapons. 
  When performing illumination support missions, the artillery 
battalion (battery) fires illumination rounds to illuminate the 
terrain and targets and to place light markers (movement 
orientation lights). 
  Preparations for an offensive at night are conducted during 
daylight. The artillery battalion commander updates 
reconnaissance missions for the batteries and moves the 
observation posts closer to the enemy's defenses; assigns the 
batteries missions for illuminating the terrain and targets, 
setting up light markers (movement orientation lights), and 
obscuring enemy observation posts and weapons; updates the 
artillery battalion's (batteries') fire missions on the terrain 
and determines the order of their execution; clarifies the 
recognition symbols of friendly troops and the procedure for 
cooperation with combined-arms subunits; disseminates to 
subunits mutual recognition signals and signals denoting lines 
reached by advancing subunits; if necessary, organizes the 
selection of fire positions and command and observation post 
locations and their surveys; updates the route and order of 
relocation of batteries; allocates illumination ammunition and 
supplies the batteries with illuminating and signaling devices; 
and checks the serviceability of night-vision and illumination 
devices. 
  The artillery battalion commander pays special attention to 
preparing communications equipment and organizing reliable 
communications during the offensive. 
  The command and observation posts of the artillery battalion 
and batteries usually carry out the following measures to 
prepare for conducting reconnaissance and fire control at night: 
they select or set up manmade reference points that are visible 
at night and determine grid azimuths (bearings); prepare 
instrument illumination and flashlights for use by scouts and 
radiotelephone operators; exercise light and sound discipline; 
camouflage the observation post against enemy night-vision 
devices; indicate to scouts the axes (sectors, objects) 
requiring special attention; and assign additional missions for 
local security. 
  The night reference points designated are usually local 
features whose silhouettes have characteristic outlines and can 
be seen against the night sky (for example, individual trees, 
treelines, tall buildings, smokestacks, and so forth). 
  A man-made reference point (for example, a stake with 
electric illumination pointing towards the command and 
observation post) is set up no closer than 50 meters to check 
the orientation of the instruments at the command and 
observation post. In addition, it is advisable to set up stakes 
painted white in the summer and black in the winter 7-10 meters 
from the rangefinder to the right and left of the base line in 
line with selected reference points for rapid target designation. 
  Conducting reconnaissance at night requires good training of 
officers, NCO's [noncommissioned officers], and soldiers. Local 
features observed when terrain is illuminated by illumination 
devices differ substantially from those visible during the day. 
As an illumination flare descends, shadows from the objects 
appear which distort them even more. Dark local features and 
terrain sectors (for example, marshes, bushes, and plowed 
fields) appear smaller in size and more distant than they 
actually are. Illuminated dry roads, rocks, hedges, wooden 
fences, trench breastworks, barbed-wire entanglements, 
sandhills, and other similar features are clearly seen. Tanks, 
motor vehicles, and ATGM launchers can be observed through 
binoculars at a distance of 2.5-3 km. 
  Primarily battlefield surveillance (SNAR) and 
mortar-detection artillery (ARSOM) radars, sound-ranging 
subunits, night-vision devices, and stopwatches are used for 
reconnaissance of the enemy, adjustment of fire on targets 
(registration points), and monitoring fire for effect. 
  Firing data are determined according to general rules. Fire 
for effect is conducted for rebound effect or using shells with 
time fuses. 
  The following measures are carried out to prepare gun 
platoons for operations at night: angles of site are determined 
when getting a fix on targets (registration points); 
illuminating shells, smoke shells, and shells with a spotting 
charge are distributed among the batteries, taking into account 
the missions to be carried out; illumination is prepared for 
sights, collimators, night aiming points, aiming circles, and 
fire directors; the baseline of fire is staked out with luminous 
stakes; steps are taken to observe light discipline; and local 
security is reinforced. 
  Flashlights or kerosene lanterns with a vertical or 
cruciform 
slot for light in the direction of the fire position are used to 
stake out the baseline of fire and to set up night aiming 
points. Stakes without illumination also can be used to stake 
out the baseline on moonlit nights. 
  When selecting primary and alternate aiming points, it is 
necessary that they be no closer than 200 meters from the guns 
and that the angle between them be at least 10-00. It is best to 
prepare day aiming points for nighttime, since deflections on 
targets remain unchanged in this case. If other aiming points 
are to be prepared or if a collimator is to be used, the 
deflections are recalculated. 
  Optical instruments and the glass of motor vehicle and prime 
mover cabs are prepared to attenuate the effect of emissions 
from a nuclear burst, and personnel wear special goggles. 
  To reinforce local security, additional sentry posts are set 
up, patrolling is organized to reinforce local security, and an 
alert gun crew and alert drivers are assigned. 
  Breakthrough of enemy defenses at night is usually 
accomplished from a position of direct contact with the enemy. 
The first-echelon battalion goes over to the attack, as a rule, 
after artillery preparation of the attack or after the shelling. 
Sometimes the offensive may begin without artillery preparation 
of the attack in order to achieve surprise. 
  During artillery preparation of the attack, if called for by 
the plan, a specially assigned battery (platoon, guns, mortars) 
fire illumination or incendiary shells (mortar rounds) to 
illuminate the terrain and targets, blind observation posts 
(electrooptical devices) and weapons, and set fires in the area 
occupied by the enemy. Electrooptical devices are blinded by the 
burning of illuminating shell flare on the ground 100-150 meters 
in front of the target being blinded. 
  During the course of the attack, the artillery battalion 
commander relocates jointly with the commander of the maneuver 
battalion being supported. The indicated axis of attack is 
maintained according to the azimuth or reference points, 
primarily by light markers which are set up by command of the 
artillery battalion commander. The closest reference point is 
designated in the area occupied by the enemy two-three km from 
friendly subunits, and the rest are designated deep in the 
enemy's defenses at the same distance from each other. When the 
maneuver battalion comes to within 1.5-2 km of the reference 
point, they cease fire with authorization of the maneuver 
battalion commander and lift fire for setting up the next 
reference point. When setting up reference points, fire is 
delivered by platoon volleys or by series of deliberate fire of 
a platoon (gun) at the rate of from two to five minutes. 
  Movement orientation lights are used, as a rule, for marking 
boundaries and sometimes for more precise indication of the 
direction of advance. Placement of the lights is accomplished 
by simultaneous firing along two light markers which are 
adjacent in depth. 
  Target designation at night is accomplished by tracer rounds 
and signal flares and is clarified by personal contact between 
the artillery battalion commander and the maneuver battalion 
commander. 
  Registration fire and fire for effect at night are done 
according to Gunnery and Fire Control Regulations and Procedures. 
  Fire positions for night firing are selected before the 
start 
of the offensive and as close as possible to the forward 
subunits. 
  When fire positions are changed, it is advisable to relocate 
most of the artillery battalion simultaneously. During the 
movement, orientation is maintained according to well-visible 
(prominent) local features, by compass, by movement orientation 
lights, and using a course plotter. 
  During the transition from night to day operations, the 
enemy 
will strive to restore his troops' previous position by 
counterattacks. 
  Taking this into account, the artillery battalion commander 
must update information on the enemy and the position of 
friendly forward subunits; assign additional missions for 
reconnaissance of the enemy; update fire missions for the 
batteries to cover the flanks and consolidate a captured line; 
change fire positions; and replenish subunits' ammunition. 
  The artillery battalion commander may prepare barrage fire 
in 
advance to repel an enemy counterattack. 
  The experience of combat operations during the Great 
Patriotic War showed that the hours of darkness contributed to 
achieving surprise and reduced losses from enemy fire. However, 
a night offensive required thorough preparation, which was 
usually accomplished during daylight. Cooperation between 
infantry and tanks was worked out with precision, and attention 
was given to coordinating signals and methods of target 
designation. 
  Artillery preparation of the attack during a night offensive 
was not always conducted; however, artillery and mortars were 
ready to open fire immediately against assigned targets. After 
taking designated attack targets, rifle subunits would be ready 
for the defense, particularly an antitank defense. To this end, 
antitank weapons were attached to them, and reconnaissance of 
the enemy and local security would be organized. 
<H5>  Operations in the Mountains </H5>
  Abrupt changes in the weather conditions, frequent fog, low 
cloud cover, difficulty of orientation on the terrain, 
insufficient or lack of convenient routes for motor transport 
movement, steep ascents and descents, rocky soil, lack of 
convenient places for fire positions, and other peculiarities of 
mountainous terrain affect the operations of artillery subunits 
in the mountains. 
  When organizing reconnaissance in the artillery battalion, 
it 
is necessary to study the surrounding terrain carefully and take 
into account the nature of its relief. The command and 
observation posts and observation posts of the artillery 
battalion and batteries are located at different elevations, 
dispersed laterally and staggered in depth for a better view of 
the terrain. Lateral observation posts can be set up in the 
location of adjacent subunits. Individual observation posts also 
may be deployed behind fire positions. Cross-observation posts 
should be deployed at approximately the same elevation. 
  Target designation in the mountains is performed by the 
usual 
method. However, an artillery panorama (Figure 19) is used for 
convenience and ease of orientation on the terrain. 




    Fire positions are selected in mountain valleys, hollows, 
gorges, on reverse hill slopes, in natural clearings, and in 
other convenient places. Fire positions should not be selected 
and artillery prime movers should not be positioned in dried-up 
river beds or near shallow mountain rivers, since they may 
suddenly turn into deep rivers and disrupt mission 
accomplishment. 
  Batteries' gun platoons may be deployed either at one fire 
position or by platoons at two fire positions. Sometimes two 
batteries or the entire artillery battalion may be situated at 
one site. Positioning of batteries at various elevations and 
placing the guns in the batteries with considerable range and 
height differences is typical for mountainous conditions. 
  When figuring computed data, the artillery battalion staff 
takes into account the difference in elevation of battery fire 
positions, and the SOB [senior battery officer] calculates and 
makes corrections for the height difference of guns relative to 
the base gun. 
  Fire positions in the mountains may be selected near roads. 
This improves the artillery battalion's maneuverability and 
creates the best conditions for conducting a topogeodetic survey 
and delivering ammunition. However, such placement of gun 
platoons increases the possibility of the enemy detecting them 
and neutralizing them by artillery fire and air strikes. 
  An insufficiently developed topogeodetic network or the lack 
of it makes it difficult to determine fire position coordinates 
and command and observation post sites. In a number of cases, a 
topogeodetic survey is performed using the conventional system 
of coordinates. 
  Rocky and stony soils and steep slopes make engineer 
preparation of fire positions and command and observation post 
sites difficult. Taking these conditions into account, one 
should make extensive use of existing natural cover and, when 
possible, prepare slit trenches for personnel and gun 
emplacements. 
  Radio is the primary means of communication in the 
mountains. 
However, the mountains create a screening effect, reducing the 
range of communications. Therefore, radios are situated on the 
slopes of the mountain facing the operator on the other end and 
on mountain peaks; directional antennas also are used. If line 
of sight between radios is difficult due to terrain conditions, 
an intermediate radio is set up on the dominant elevation. 
  An offensive in the mountains is conducted primarily along 
valleys, mountain ridges, and roads. Depending on the nature of 
the mountainous terrain, the maneuver battalion may operate as 
part of the regiment's main body or independently, apart from 
the main body. Wide and close envelopment of the flanks of enemy 
strongholds combined with a frontal attack are a maneuver 
battalion's usual actions in the mountains. A maneuver 
battalion, and sometimes even a company, may be designated as an 
enveloping detachment to capture important objectives deep in 
the enemy defenses. 
  When advancing along a narrow mountain valley, a maneuver 
battalion first takes the adjacent elevations from which the 
enemy is conducting flanking fire. A maneuver battalion captures 
a mountain pass from the front on its own or in cooperation with 
an enveloping detachment. The artillery battalion may be 
attached to or support the maneuver battalion. 
  During artillery preparation of the attack, the artillery 
battalion may carry out missions involving simultaneous 
engagement of several targets located on various altitude 
levels. Each battery of the artillery battalion will most often 
carry out missions independently, engaging individual observed 
weapons in the open and under cover. Some of the artillery 
battalion's guns move up to direct-fire positions to increase 
fire effectiveness and conserve ammunition. Delivery of 
effective fire involves certain difficulties in conditions of 
mountainous terrain. The enemy is engaged on reverse hill 
slopes, in ravines, and in hollows by fire from howitzer and 
mortar batteries. Strongholds adjacent to roads and mountain 
passes are neutralized with the greatest reliability. 
  Artillery support of the attack is conducted taking into 
account the conditions of the enemy's defensive disposition. 
  When attacking an elevation with a multitiered disposition 
of 
weapons, the artillery battalion first neutralizes the weapons 
in the lower tiers. When the attacking subunits approach the 
elevation, the artillery battalion shifts fire to the targets in 
the next tiers, particularly those delivering flanking fire. 
  Prior to attacking a stronghold with weapons disposed in a 
single tier, the artillery battalion neutralizes them before the 
attacking subunits reach the troop safety line, then shifts fire 
against the targets located in the rear and on adjacent and 
distant elevations, and also against the enemy as it builds up 
for a counterattack. 
  The role of independent battery fire in the mountains is 
increasing considerably. Timely and accurate battery fire 
provides effective help to attacking subunits in capturing 
roads, passes in gorges, mountain passes, and bridges. In this 
regard, the artillery battalion commander and battery commanders 
must display independence, resourcefulness, and initiative for 
successful accomplishment of the assigned mission during an 
offensive. 
  Experience of combat operations in the mountains shows that 
to increase accuracy of fire against targets, two-three 
registration points are set up at various levels, and fire is 
shifted from the registration points, which helps to achieve 
more effective target engagement. Adjustment of fire is 
mandatory in these conditions. 
  Continuous cooperation in the mountains is achieved by the 
joint location and relocation of the command and observation 
posts of the maneuver battalion and artillery battalion and of 
the companies and batteries. Observation posts are set up at a 
distance from the artillery battalion and batteries in order to 
support reconnaissance of the enemy and adjustment of fire. It 
should be borne in mind that relocating command and observation 
posts and observation posts will mean negotiating steep slopes, 
which will require additional time. Considerable difficulties 
will arise in orientation, topogeodetic survey, determination of 
target coordinates, and fire control. 
  Advancing enemy reserves and withdrawing subunits are 
engaged 
by fire from the artillery battalion and batteries when they 
cross mountain passes, gorges, and bridges, and when they 
negotiate mountain rivers and other difficult places. For fire 
control under these conditions, a forward observation post is 
set up to direct the combat formations of motorized rifle 
subunits, or an observation post is left on the predominant 
elevation in the rear of friendly subunits. When necessary, a 
forward observation post may be sent into the area occupied by 
the enemy. Adjustment of fire can also be conducted from a 
helicopter. 
  Battery relocation takes into account the continuous support 
of the maneuver battalion's combat operations, in addition to 
the nature of the terrain and the possibility of a rapid 
relocation to new fire positions. Experience shows that 
considerably more time will be spent on leaving the fire 
position, moving gun platoons over a mountain road, and 
deployment than when operating in conditions of average terrain. 
Therefore, fire positions should be changed less frequently, and 
fire should be delivered from positions occupied to maximum 
ranges. Relocation in the zone of an adjacent unit's advance in 
the mountains is permitted with authorization of the senior 
commander. Safety precautions prescribed when traveling over 
mountain roads are observed during the relocation. 
  With the start of an offensive or during the course of it, 
an 
artillery battalion (battery) may be assigned to support an 
enveloping detachment. The intelligence officer (KVU 
[headquarters platoon commander]) with necessary personnel and 
reconnaissance and communications equipment is sent out with the 
detachment commander. 
  Let us follow the instructive actions of an artillery 
battalion in support of an enveloping detachment as part of a 
reinforced rifle battalion in the mountains.[.sup]5[/] 
  On 20 September 1944, out troops were pursuing fascist 
German units in mountainous woodland. The 4th Rifle Regt 
approached the populated area of Bogoviny, located on an 
important axis (Figure 20), and attacked it on the move. 
Encountering strong fire resistance from the eastern outskirts, 
the regiment was unsuccessful and withdrew to initial 
positions. 




    To take the populated area with the fewest losses, it 
was decided to dispatch an enveloping detachment--the reinforced 
1st Bn, 4th Rifle Regt. Its mission was to go around Bogoviny 
from the north on the night of 22/23 September, cut off the 
highway running from Bogoviny to Zaychar, and at 0600 hours, 
supported by the 2d Bn, 818th Artillery Regiment, attack and 
destroy the enemy in Bogoviny. 
  In preparing for combat, the artillery battalion 
commander encountered difficulties in selecting fire positions 
in the mountains for the gun batteries (ZIS-3's). If the gun 
platoons were deployed 2 km from the forward edge, the minimum 
elevation would not allow firing on targets; if the fire 
positions were selected five-six km away, the batteries would 
not have enough cable to establish communications. 
  After assessing the situation, the artillery battalion 
commander decided to advance the gun platoons to direct-fire 
positions on a crest of hills two km from the forward edge of 
the enemy's defenses and to deploy the howitzer battery on 
reverse hill slopes. 
  Smoke pots were lit 250-300 meters ahead of the fire 
positions, 10 minutes before the start of registration fire, to 
conceal the disposition of gun platoons. The smoke screen was 
maintained throughout the registration fire. 
  The command and observation posts of the gun batteries 
were deployed on hills 500 meters east of Bogoviny. The 
artillery battalion commander, together with the howitzer 
battery commander, intelligence officer, and a group of scouts 
with two radios, set off together with the maneuver battalion to 
bypass Bogoviny. 
  By 0400 hours on 23 September the maneuver battalion 
had bypassed the populated area, cut off the highway to Zaychar, 
and taken up the attack position in the bushes 200 meters west 
of Bogoviny. The enemy did not detect the maneuver 
battalion. 
  After deploying his command and observation post 
together with the maneuver battalion's command and observation 
post, the artillery battalion commander conducted registration 
fire. Target coordinates were determined using bilateral 
observation. Registration fire was conducted with smoke shells 
until bursts were brought to the line observer target. 
Registration fire was completed by 0540 hours. 
  At 0630 hours, the artillery battalion conducted a 
five-minute shelling against targets on the western outskirts of 
Bogoviny. The infantry initiated the assault, seized the western 
outskirts, and continued to advance. Seeing the threat of 
encirclement, the enemy counterattacked the maneuver battalion 
with up to two companies, but was beaten back by the artillery 
battalion's fire and withdrew into the center of Bogoviny. 
  The artillery battalion's fire was shifted to the 
center of the populated area. After a 10-minute shelling, our 
infantry resumed the attack. Gathering the remnants of his 
subunits, the enemy moved into a counterattack, supported by 
three tanks and two APC's, in order to break out of 
encirclement. However, the well-organized fire of our infantry 
and artillery foiled this counterattack as well. 
  Using the reserves, the maneuver battalion commander 
attacked the scattered enemy subunits and in the vicinity of the 
school and church encircled and destroyed them. Only a small 
group withdrew to the eastern outskirts of the populated area, 
where it met with organized fire from the 4th and 5th Batteries 
and was completely routed by the attack of the maneuver 
battalion. In this battle, the maneuver battalion took 280 
soldiers and officers prisoner and captured three tanks, two 
mortar batteries, a 105-mm artillery battery, and much other 
military equipment and property. The maneuver battalion 
successfully accomplished its assigned mission and supported the 
advance of our units toward the city of Zaychar. 
  In this battle, the artillery battalion commander 
displayed creativeness in selecting fire positions for the gun 
and howitzer batteries and in covering the registration fire 
with a smoke screen. 
<H5>  Operations in the Desert </H5>
  Monotony of the level terrain, sharp temperature 
fluctuations 
during a 24-hour period, limited water sources, and frequent 
sandstorms affect the combat operations of artillery in the 
desert. High daytime temperatures can cause heat strokes in 
personnel, and the bright daytime sun can cause eye ailments. 
  To prevent unfavorable effects on subunit personnel, they 
are 
provided with appropriate clothing, and observance of water 
discipline is monitored. In addition, lengthy halts should be 
avoided at locations of stagnant air heated by the sun. 
  The monotonous level nature of the terrain causes 
considerable difficulties with orientation, target designation, 
and determining distances and target coordinates. It also 
complicates map usage and the topogeodetic survey. On the other 
hand, such terrain permits effective use of aerial and radar 
reconnaissance. Coordinates of observed targets are reliably 
determined by using a baseless rangefinder and bilateral 
observation. 
  As a rule, command and observation posts are deployed on the 
slopes of sand dunes, in undergrowth, and in other convenient 
spots. Fire positions should be selected between sand dunes and 
hillocks, in ravines, and in dry riverbeds. They can be located 
farther from the forward edge than in ordinary conditions. 
Topographic survey vehicles and gyroscopic and astronomical 
orientation should be used extensively in topographic survey of 
sites for command and observation posts, observation posts, and 
fire positions. In the absence of firm points in a geodetic 
network, it can be accomplished in a conventional coordinate 
system. Inputs of personnel and equipment for digging shelters 
are reduced during engineer preparation of fire positions and 
command and observation sites in sandy soil. However, sandy soil 
requires additional reinforcement of slopes. 
  The locations of guns and artillery prime movers are 
camouflaged by organic assets and also by using camouflage paint. 
  Reserves of water and fuel for preparing food and for other 
needs are established when an artillery battalion operates in 
waterless areas. It is advisable to have containers for water 
storage and transportation in every subunit. Strict monitoring 
of water use is established. 
  The sharp temperature fluctuations in a 24-hour period cause 
changes in charge temperatures, which affects the accuracy of 
fire. In this connection, ammunition should be protected against 
the effect of direct sunlight, charge temperatures should be 
checked more often, and corrections for these changes should be 
made to computed firing data. 
  An offensive in the desert is usually conducted along the 
most important individual axes, as a rule, without halt in 
attack position, using broad maneuver for wide and close 
envelopment of the enemy's exposed flanks and attacking from the 
rear. 
  Hours of darkness are used most often for aggressive and 
decisive operations. The maneuver battalion's combat formation 
is aligned taking into account the possibility of conducting 
independent operations. 
  In an offensive, an artillery battalion may operate as part 
of an artillery group or be attached to a maneuver battalion 
that makes up an enveloping detachment. Primarily self-propelled 
artillery subunits are assigned to the enveloping detachment. 
  When preparing for an offensive, the artillery battalion 
commander clarifies from the commander of the supported 
battalion and disseminates to all subunit commanders the azimuth 
of the axis of the offensive and the procedure for designating 
the position of forward subunits. 
  Before the start of the offensive, the artillery battalion 
may participate in artillery preparation of the attack or 
conduct a brief shelling, neutralizing enemy strongholds 
(centers of defense), mortar platoons, artillery batteries, 
command posts, and reserves. 
  During the course of the offensive, the advance of the 
maneuver battalion's subunits may be uneven and in echelons; 
therefore, enemy counterattacks against exposed flanks are 
possible. The artillery battalion commander organizes 
reconnaissance and, if an advancing enemy is detected, organizes 
timely engagement of him. 
  When bypassing individual enemy strongholds, the artillery 
battalion screens the flank of the advancing maneuver battalion, 
neutralizing enemy weapons or blanketing them with smoke. The 
artillery battalion may lay a smoke screen during commitment of 
the maneuver battalion's (regiment's) second echelon to cover 
its advance. 
  Organization of self-defense of gun platoons throughout the 
offensive is a special concern of the senior battery officer 
(gun platoon commander), since there is an increased possibility 
of individual groups of tanks breaking through when conducting 
desert combat. When relocating the command and observation post, 
command and control of subunits is accomplished in the movement. 
Gun platoons relocate along directions maintained by instruments 
of the command vehicles. 
<H5>  Operations in Northern Areas </H5>
  The vast sections of tundra, forest tundra, and wooded 
terrain and, in some sectors, mountainous terrain with a large 
number of lakes, boulders, and rocky ground affect an artillery 
battalion's combat operations in northern areas. 
  Frequent abundant snowfalls, blizzards, low temperatures, 
and 
deep snow cover hinder the artillery battalion's movement and 
deployment, require systematic clearing of roads or laying of 
cross-country routes, and make it necessary to supply motor 
vehicles and prime movers with antifreeze and warming covers. If 
the situation permits, guns are warmed up with individual rounds 
at reduced charges in order to open fire in a timely manner. 
Warm clothing and hot meals are provided to personnel to ensure 
they are able to work and to prevent frostbite. Warming stations 
are set up in the vicinity of the fire positions and command and 
observation posts at the rate of one station per platoon. 
  The frozen ground hinders engineer preparation of fire 
positions and sites for subunit command and observation posts. 
When there is a deep snow cover, shelters, including gun 
emplacements and command and observation post sites, are made 
out of snow, and ice is frozen on their breastworks for strength. 
  Abundant snowfall and the long polar night make it difficult 
to conduct artillery reconnaissance and adjustment of fire, and 
also to use topographic maps for orientation. For camouflage, 
the guns, prime movers, and other equipment are painted white, 
and personnel are supplied with camouflage smocks. Gun 
emplacements are camouflaged with organic camouflage nets. 
  Alert crews, scouts, and observers are relieved more often 
in 
the winter; they are given the opportunity and time to warm up. 
Additional reserves of ammunition, fuels, and rations are 
established in case of heavy snowdrifts. 
  In the summertime, the abundance of lakes, the presence of 
vast swampy areas, and the huge number of mosquitoes and 
blood-sucking flies cause considerable difficulties for 
artillery operations. 
  Frequent ionospheric and geomagnetic disturbances adversely 
affect the operation of radios, particularly HF radios. These 
phenomena make it impossible to use an aiming circle. In these 
cases, the orientation of instruments on celestial bodies and a 
topographic survey of combat formation elements using the 
topographic survey vehicle or a conventional coordinate system 
should be widely used. 
  An offensive in northern areas is conducted along roads, 
rivers, and other accessible axes. It usually begins from a 
position of direct contact with the enemy; on terrain accessible 
for subunit operations off the roads, it is accomplished without 
halt in attack position. 
  An artillery battalion may be attached to or support a 
first-echelon maneuver battalion or a maneuver battalion 
attacking on an independent axis. In addition, an artillery 
battalion (battery) of self-propelled artillery is attached to 
an enveloping detachment. 
  In northern areas, an artillery battalion often will conduct 
combat operations at night, which will require that additional 
illumination and smoke rounds be allocated to it. Other measures 
also must be conducted to ensure the best accomplishment of 
missions at night. 
  Artillery preparation and support of advancing subunits are 
usually conducted by concentrated fire and engagement of single 
targets. When advancing on important axes, artillery support may 
be accomplished by successive fire concentration. 
  When planning and preparing combat operations, the 
difficulty 
of the terrain both in the winter and summer should be taken 
into account. Therefore, fire positions are usually selected 
near roads and cross-country routes. 
  The long nights in the winter and the frequent fog in the 
summer create favorable conditions for surprise offensive 
operations and employment of enveloping detachments. In such 
conditions, the artillery battalion must be ready to execute a 
sudden adjustment of fire and maneuver of subunits.

<H5>  Chapter Five. The Artillery Battalion in a Meeting Engagement </H5>
<H5>  Artillery Battalion Missions </H5>
  The high mobility and great shock force of subunits and 
units 
of modern armies, which are equipped with tanks, combat 
vehicles, APC's, artillery, mortars, ATGM launchers, and other 
weapons, as well as decisiveness in achieving assigned missions 
give combat operations a mobile nature. 
  Combat operations will be accompanied by rapid changes in 
the 
situation, considerable gaps will arise between subunits and 
units, and exposed flanks will appear as a result. Each side 
will strive to defeat the opposition by using vigorous offensive 
operations. Exploiting the results of nuclear strikes and the 
fire of conventional weapons, attacking subunits will strive to 
deliver attacks against exposed flanks in short periods of time 
and break through into their rear. 
  An engagement may emerge under the most varied conditions. 
It 
is possible during a march, during exploitation, while repelling 
enemy counterattacks on the move, and also in the defense when 
our second echelons (reserves), advancing for a counterattack or 
for occupying a favorable line, encounter the attacking enemy. 
  In anticipation of an encounter with the enemy, each side 
attempts to preempt the other in opening artillery fire, moving 
subunits to a favorable line, deployment, and shifting to the 
offensive. Depending on the situation conditions and the 
distance separating the sides, subunits may advance in battle, 
approach march, or march formations. Sometimes part of the 
forces may advance in battle or approach march formations, and 
part in march formation. 
  The mission of artillery in a meeting engagement is to 
preempt the enemy in deploying his artillery and opening fire, 
and to achieve fire superiority, and thus enable our units to 
deploy and seize the initiative. 
  In a march in anticipation of engagement, the artillery 
battalion may operate as part of a forward detachment, an 
advance guard, or the main body. 
  In a meeting engagement during pursuit of the enemy or in a 
defensive maneuver, the artillery battalion may be a part of an 
artillery group and support or be attached to a first-echelon 
battalion. In this case, the artillery battalion may move in the 
maneuver battalion's column, be deployed in battle formation, or 
relocate from one fire position area to another at full strength 
or with a part of the batteries. 
  The artillery battalion may carry out the following missions 
in an engagement: block the advance of enemy columns and the 
deployment of tanks and motorized infantry into battle 
formation; screen the advance and deployment of friendly 
motorized rifle and tank subunits and support their attack; 
screen exposed flanks of subunits and repel enemy tank and 
infantry attacks; block the enemy's withdrawal and consolidation 
on favorable lines; and support combined-arms subunits when 
consolidating captured lines. 
  When carrying out these missions, the artillery battalion 
engages the enemy's offensive nuclear and chemical weapons; his 
artillery and mortar batteries; approaching columns, 
particularly at crossings, at chokepoints, and in other sectors. 
The purpose is to hinder deployment of forces; tanks, personnel; 
weapons, above all antitank weapons; electronic equipment; and 
command posts. The artillery battalion achieves success in 
carrying out assigned missions in such conditions by its correct 
disposition in the march (approach march) formation of the 
combined-arms unit or subunit, constant conducting of artillery 
reconnaissance, organization of stable communications, rapid 
deployment into battle formation, preparation of fire in short 
time periods, and broad initiative and independence of subunit 
commanders. 
  Fire missions are carried out by decision of the artillery 
battalion commander, maneuver battalion commander, or senior 
artillery commander (chief). Concentrated fire or engagement of 
single targets is used to engage the enemy, and barrage fire is 
used to repel attacks (counterattacks). 
  One of the typical features of an engagement is the lack of 
a 
long period of time to organize it. All work for organizing the 
artillery battalion's combat operations will be carried out in 
minimum time periods. The artillery battalion commander usually 
assigns missions to battery commanders from the map and by brief 
instructions and commands. 
<H5>  Conducting Combat Operations </H5>
  When an artillery battalion operates as part of a forward 
detachment (advance guard), an engagement usually begins with a 
clash between the advance party and forward enemy units. When it 
encounters enemy reconnaissance and security subunits, the 
advance party destroys them by fire and decisive actions on the 
move and continues carrying out its assigned mission. 
  The commander of a battery that is part of an advance party 
moves out with the commander of the advance party with part of 
the headquarters platoon, while gun platoons headed by the 
senior battery officer are located at the tail of the column 
(Figure 21). For rapid deployment of the battery, the battery 
commander conducts reconnaissance of the terrain continuously on 
the route of movement, plans fire positions in succession, and 
maintains continuous radio communications with the gun platoons. 
The commander of the battery's headquarters platoon may proceed 
with the forward patrol with reconnaissance and communications 
equipment. 




    On encountering superior enemy forces or when the enemy has 
preempted the advance party in deployment, the advance party 
commander takes steps to occupy a favorable line, engages the 
enemy with fire from all weapons, and ensures conditions for 
deployment and commitment of the main body of the advance guard. 
Motorized rifle company personnel dismount. 
  The battery deploys immediately into battle formation on 
order of the advance party commander. The battery commander 
indicates to the senior battery officer the fire position area 
(on the map), the baseline of fire, the minimum range of fire, 
and the location of the battery command and observation post. 
Timeliness in opening fire by the battery is achieved and 
continuous cooperation with the advance party is maintained by 
deploying the battery command and observation post together with 
the advance party commander's command and observation post and 
by deploying the gun platoons at fire positions near the road 
(route). The battery commander issues instructions to the 
headquarters platoon commander for reconnoitering the advancing 
enemy columns, their composition, and their direction and speed 
of movement; for determining coordinates of enemy weapons ahead 
of line of conduct of combat operations by the advance party and 
commitment of the main body of the forward detachment (advance 
guard); and for reconnoitering enemy observation posts and 
artillery and mortar batteries. 
  The battery supports the advance party's combat at command 
of 
the battery commander or at the direction of the advance party 
commander. Primarily, it neutralizes tanks and motorized 
infantry attacking or deploying for an attack and posing the 
greatest danger to the advance party. 
  As a rule, the battery fires against one or simultaneously 
against two targets. When firing against two targets, the 
battery commander may control one platoon, and the headquarters 
platoon commander the other. The battery commander prepares 
and conducts a fixed barrage to repel an enemy attack. 
  The battery commander informs the artillery battalion 
commander when a meeting engagement is started, when the battery 
deploys into battle formation, and when it opens fire. 
  Since the depth of the advance party column is 
insignificant, 
gun platoons will deploy a short distance from the advance party 
battle formation. If there are exposed flanks, a breakthrough by 
enemy tanks to the battery gun platoons is possible. 
  Tanks that have broken through are destroyed by direct fire. 
To do this, the senior battery officer determines the likely 
avenues of tank approach immediately after occupying the fire 
positions and organizes observation, indicating to gun 
commanders the sectors for firing on tanks and the line and 
signal for opening fire on them. 
  In a number of cases, when an engagement begins, the 
artillery battery may deploy at a direct-fire position to 
destroy tanks, armored vehicles, antitank weapons, and other 
important targets by direct fire. Organizing fire control of 
guns (locations of radios and procedure for transmitting 
commands and target designation) must be provided for in advance. 
  The experience of the Great Patriotic War also indicates 
that 
an artillery battalion may sometimes be deployed at full 
strength.[.sup]1[/] 
  Thus, in the Battle of Stalingrad, the 8th Separate 
Horse-Artillery Battalion was supporting the offensive led by a 
guards cavalry regiment. At night on 22 November 1942, it was 
successfully advancing in the operational rear of the enemy's 
defense--a long, deep ravine on the line of march. The cavalry 
regiment easily negotiated it and continued to move, while the 
artillery battalion had great difficulty crossing this ravine 
due to ice and did so only toward dawn. The regiment being 
supported was already a considerable distance away, and the 
artillery battalion continued moving in an independent column. 
It soon approached a fork of two roads: an improved dirt road 
and a field road. The artillery battalion commander halted the 
column and sent out reconnaissance. 
  A halted column soon became visible 150-200 meters down 
the improved road; initially it was taken to be the motor column 
of our units. The artillery battalion continued moving over the 
left field road. It was soon learned that the column on the 
improved road was a fascist German column, which numbered 42 
tanks and several dozen vehicles. Having seen the artillery 
battalion, the fascists opened fire on it from all guns and 
machineguns. 
  The artillery battalion immediately deployed along the 
road and began direct fire on the enemy tanks. A fierce fight 
ensued. In groups of four-six tanks each, the enemy began to 
outflank the artillery battalion, simultaneously attacking the 
artillery battalion with the bulk of the tanks. But four tanks 
were set afire by the very first shells from guns of the 1st and 
3d batteries. The rest of the tanks halted and opened fire. 
Soon, two guns were destroyed and nine horses killed in the 3d 
Battery. The fighting continued. Only one gunner remained at one 
of the guns, but he continued to fight the tanks. Other 
artillery units soon came to the battalion's aid and provided 
considerable assistance to the artillery battalion. A total of 
25 enemy tanks were knocked out, of which nine were set afire 
and seven disabled by the artillery battalion, which suffered 
minor losses. 
  With the start of deployment of the advance party for 
combat, 
the artillery battalion intelligence officer selects the site 
for the battalion's command and observation post near the 
command and observation post of the advance party commander, 
stops the vehicle, sets up instruments, and organizes 
reconnaissance of the enemy. He informs the artillery battalion 
about his location and the latest information on the enemy. 
  When the advance party engages in combat, the forward 
detachment (advance guard) commander moves up to the advance 
party, assesses the situation, and, according to the results of 
the combat, makes the decision to deploy the main body for a 
meeting engagement and assigns missions to organic and attached 
subunits. 
  Advancing with the forward detachment (advance guard) 
commander, the artillery battalion commander receives from him 
the mission on the move and in conditions of extremely limited 
time must do the following: update the missions for 
reconnaissance of the enemy; plan the artillery battalion's fire 
position area; determine the fire missions (targets for 
neutralization) in accordance with the forward detachment 
(advance guard) commander's decision; issue instructions for 
movement and deployment of the artillery battalion into battle 
formation in the planned area; assign missions to the batteries; 
and brief the procedures for their cooperation with supporting 
combined-arms subunits. 
  In these conditions, the artillery battalion commander 
usually assigns (briefs) missions to subordinates using brief 
operational instructions, commands, and earlier established 
signals both personally and over communications equipment. When 
determining the fire missions for the batteries, the artillery 
battalion commander takes into account the results of 
reconnaissance from all assets. It is advisable to leave as the 
fire mission a target (targets) reconnoitered by a given battery. 
  In the deployment instructions, the artillery battalion 
commander gives information about the enemy (where he is located 
and his actions), the areas (locations) of the battery fire 
positions and command and observation posts, the baseline of 
fire, the readiness time for opening fire, and the location of 
the artillery battalion command and observation post. The 
artillery battalion commander determines the locations of the 
battery command and observation posts taking into account the 
allocation of the batteries for supporting the motorized rifle 
companies. The company and battery command and observation posts 
are usually located on command vehicles (APC's, IFV's) and 
should be arranged side by side. In a transient battle, they may 
not be deployed on the ground. 
  After receiving from the battalion commander instructions 
(command, signal) for deployment into battle formation, the 
battery commander immediately gives the command (instruction) to 
the senior battery officer to occupy the fire positions. The 
battery commander moves to the designated area with the 
headquarters platoon, deploys the command and observation post, 
organizes reconnaissance, establishes personal contact with the 
commander of the combined-arms subunit being supported, briefs 
him on the mission, and opens fire on enemy tanks and antitank 
weapons. 
  Preempting the enemy in deployment of batteries and opening 
fire, the artillery battalion inflicts losses on the enemy even 
before engagement, disrupts the planned deployment of enemy 
subunits, and makes it possible for forward detachment (advance 
guard) subunits to engage in an organized manner. 
  Skillfully using terrain folds and under cover of artillery 
and mortar fire, the main body of the forward detachment 
(advance guard) advances to the assigned line and deploys into 
battle formation from the line of march (Figure 22) and, 
supported by fire from the artillery battalion and mortar 
subunits, boldly and decisively attack the enemy, striving to 
split the enemy and destroy it in detail. 




    Taking into account the specific conditions, the attack may 
be conducted on combat vehicles (APC's) or in a dismounted 
formation. 
  Fire from the artillery battalion (battery) is used to 
immediately neutralize observed targets whose fire is hindering 
the attack of motorized rifle and tank subunits. The available 
mobile reserves of shells are expended extremely economically. 
The artillery battalion commander prepares a fixed barrage to 
prevent the enemy from enveloping the flanks of the forward 
detachment (advance guard). 
  Success in an engagement is ensured by precise, coordinated 
actions of all subunits participating in the attack, skillful 
command and control of them, and bravery and initiative of 
personnel. 
  Here is one combat example.[.sup]2[/] 
  On 25 October 1944, our units had the mission of moving 
to the Baltic Sea and cutting off the path of fascist German 
units trying to break through from Latvia into Eastern Prussia. 
The 2d Bn, 953d Rifle Regt with the 2d Bn, 793d Gun Arty Regt 
made up the forward detachment and received the mission to 
execute a march, seize the populated areas of Iyechukreks and 
Miyemis, organize an all-around defense, and hold this area 
until the main body of the division arrived (Figure 23). 




    After assessing the situation, the maneuver battalion 
and artillery battalion commanders concluded that an encounter 
with the enemy or a surprise enemy attack was possible during 
the impending night march. In this connection, they took 
measures to prepare the subunits for the march; reinforced 
reconnaissance was sent out from the maneuver battalion and 
artillery battalion on the route of movement; local security was 
organized; column control signals were established; observers 
were assigned in each subunit; and battery commanders had 
continuous contact with the commanders of the supported 
companies. 
  Maneuver battalion personnel traveled in vehicles, and 
artillery battalion personnel in artillery prime movers. At 
dawn, after passing Miyemis, reconnaissance reported that up to 
a battalion of fascist German infantry and tanks was moving 
along the Ignatkrogs-Miyemis highway. 
  The maneuver battalion commander immediately deployed 
the companies, occupied a favorable line, and prepared the 
subunits to repel an enemy attack with stationary fire. 
Simultaneously, the artillery battalion deployed into battle 
formation. The 4th and 5th Batteries took up direct-fire 
positions, situating the guns to the right and left of the road. 
The prime movers were moved to the nearest shelters. The 6th 
Battery deployed at an indirect-fire position. The artillery 
battalion headquarters established communications with the 
batteries in a short time. 
  Fascist tanks and motorized infantry soon appeared on 
the highway and on its shoulders. After they had crossed the 
bridge and were in a broad clearing 400-500 meters from our 
subunits, we opened surprise fire from two batteries and all 
types of the maneuver battalion's weapons. The batteries' 
first rounds set three tanks afire. The enemy was confused. Soon 
the 4th Battery managed to knock out another tank; the rest of 
the tanks turned back and took cover in the small brush. At this 
time the 6th Battery, firing from indirect-fire positions, 
destroyed a group of enemy submachinegunners trying to outflank 
our subunits along a cutting. The initiative and preponderance 
of forces were on the side of our subunits. The forward 
detachment went over to the attack, destroyed up to a platoon of 
submachinegunners, and captured 10 prisoners. The approaching 
main body closed once and for all the exit for fascist German 
units in this sector from Latvia to Eastern Prussia. 
  If the enemy has preempted the forward detachment in moving 
to the designated line with superior forces and has preempted 
the advance guard in deploying and conducting the attack, the 
artillery battalion repels the enemy attacks in cooperation with 
other weapons, prevents him from penetrating into the gaps 
between companies, covers exposed flanks, and destroys by direct 
fire enemy tanks and motorized infantry that have broken through 
to the fire position area. Subsequently, the artillery battalion 
uses its fire to cover the deployment and engagement of the 
regiment's main body. 
  As a rule, an artillery battalion that is part of the main 
body moves at the head of the main column and must be in 
constant readiness for a rapid advance and immediate deployment 
into battle formation to support the advance guard and cover the 
deployment of and support the subunits of the main body during 
their commitment. The artillery battalion commander receives 
information about the enemy from the intelligence officer, who 
proceeds with the advance guard. The artillery battalion 
commander receives the mission for deployment from the map from 
the senior artillery commander or from the commander of the 
combined-arms unit to which the artillery battalion is attached. 
  An artillery battalion may be assigned to support a maneuver 
battalion which is part of the main body, and batteries may be 
assigned to support companies. In this case, the artillery 
battalion commander establishes contact with the maneuver 
battalion commander before reaching the main body's line of 
commitment. Based on the mission received, the artillery 
commander issues an instruction (prearranged signal) for 
deployment into battle formation, tasks the intelligence officer 
to select a location for the command and observation post, moves 
with the commander of the supported maneuver battalion to a 
designated place, hears the intelligence officer's report on 
reconnoitered targets, determines and assigns missions for the 
batteries, organizes artillery battalion fire control, and 
briefs procedures for cooperation of batteries with the 
supported tank or motorized rifle subunits. 
  Advancing at the head of the column of battery gun platoons, 
the artillery battalion staff directs their deployment and the 
conduct of the topogeodetic survey, sets up the battalion fire 
control post, and organizes artillery battalion fire control. 
  Prior to the attack by the main body, the artillery 
battalion 
takes part in a shelling to neutralize personnel, weapons, 
artillery batteries, and mortar platoons on the axis of attack. 
The artillery battalion commander receives the mission for the 
shelling from the senior artillery commander or the 
combined-arms commander. The shelling begins and is conducted so 
that its completion coincides with the arrival of our subunits 
at the troop safety line. During the attack, the artillery 
battalion uses concentrated fire and battery fire against single 
targets to neutralize enemy personnel and weapons blocking 
exploitation by the main body. As the combined-arms subunits 
advance, the artillery battalion usually relocates by batteries 
to ensure continuous support of the advancing subunits. 
  The artillery battalion's further actions will depend on the 
success achieved by the main body during exploitation of the 
engagement. If the enemy has begun a withdrawal, the artillery 
battalion uses its fire to engage him on the withdrawal routes, 
especially when he passes through such narrow spots as bridges, 
crossings, defiles, and the like. If the enemy attempts to go 
over to a defensive action, the artillery battalion engages 
personnel and weapons on the line he occupies.

<H5>  Chapter Six. Artillery Battalion in the Defense </H5>
<H5>  Artillery Battalion Missions </H5>
  The goal of a defense is to repel an offensive move by 
superior enemy forces, hold important areas (positions), and 
create conditions for going over to a decisive offensive action. 
  This goal can be achieved only as a result of the defending 
subunits using a number of advantages over the attacking enemy. 
These advantages may be: defensive disposition on the most 
favorable lines; more effective use of weapons (creating a fire 
plan) taking into account protective properties of the terrain 
and preparation of the positions; creating shelters for 
personnel; setting up a variety of artificial obstacles; 
accomplishing camouflage protection; and also preparation of 
maneuver of forces and weapons. 
  The goal of a defensive action can be achieved only through 
the joint efforts of subunits of all branches of troops and 
special troops. 
  Depending on the enemy's situation, the nature of his 
actions, and the mission to be undertaken, the maneuver 
battalion's defense may be in conditions of direct contact or 
out of direct contact with the enemy. The defensive action may 
be prepared in advance or organized during the course of combat. 
Going over to the defense in conditions of direct contact with 
the enemy is usually accomplished in limited time periods and, 
as a rule, under pressure of enemy airstrikes, artillery fire, 
and fire from other weapons. It can take place during the course 
of an offensive action both on the main and secondary axes for 
accomplishing missions of repelling attacks by superior enemy 
forces, securing the flanks of advancing groupings, 
consolidating captured lines and installations, and supporting a 
disengagement and withdrawal in an unfavorable situation or in 
the event of an unsuccessful outcome of an engagement. The 
frontage of the area assigned to a maneuver battalion for 
defense usually will be larger than the zone of advance. 
Therefore, it will be necessary to receive terrain sectors from 
adjacent subunits when going over to a defensive action within a 
designated area and to carry out a regrouping of the maneuver 
battalion's forces and weapons. 
  Subunits in the second echelon, when defending islands and 
the seacoast, will usually go over to the defense out of direct 
contact with the enemy. 
  A motorized rifle battalion may defend in the regiment's 
first or second echelon. The maneuver battalion carries out its 
assigned mission in coordination with adjacent subunits and with 
their support. 
  An artillery battalion on the defensive engages the enemy by 
fire in coordination with other weapons according to the 
following missions: artillery interdiction of the advance and 
deployment of enemy troops; artillery repelling of an enemy 
attack; artillery support of defending troops in the rear; and 
engagement of the enemy when conducting counterattacks. An 
artillery battalion may also be used for artillery 
counterpreparation fire. 
  When conducting artillery counterpreparation fire, 
an artillery battalion (battery) carries out fire missions for 
engaging assigned targets in accordance with the fire plan. 
Targets for engagement may be offensive nuclear and chemical 
weapons, artillery and mortar batteries, command posts, and 
tanks and motorized infantry during their advance and 
deployment, or when they have prepared for an attack from attack 
positions. The artillery battalion may carry out assigned fire 
missions from occupied fire positions or from fire positions 
after executing a maneuver. After carrying out fire missions in 
counterpreparation fire, the artillery battalion prepares to 
repel the enemy's attack; if the enemy has executed a maneuver, 
the battalion returns to the previous or newly assigned fire 
position area. 
  In artillery interdiction of an advance and deployment 
of enemy troops, the artillery battalion (battery) engages 
offensive nuclear and chemical weapons, artillery and mortar 
batteries, air defense weapons, command posts, personnel, and 
weapons and combat equipment located in columns or deploying at 
positions. 
  The artillery battalion executes fire missions on commands 
of 
the senior artillery commander (chief) or on the artillery 
battalion commander's initiative. 
  Timeliness in opening fire to engage columns is achieved by 
advance preparation of fire against road junctions, bridges, 
crossings, exits from populated areas, and other chokepoints on 
probable routes of enemy advance and lines of probable 
deployment into approach march formation. 
  An artillery battalion (battery) assigned for support or 
attached to a maneuver battalion (company) that has been 
assigned to operate in the security zone or to defend the 
forward position engages advancing enemy columns beginning with 
maximum range of fire. Together with weapons of the maneuver 
battalion (company), the artillery battalion (battery) repels 
the attack of forward enemy subunits, prevents their close or 
deep envelopment of the position being held, and covers the 
disengagement and withdrawal of subunits to the next position. 
  Artillery reconnaissance subunits with communications 
equipment may be assigned to combat reconnaissance patrols of 
the maneuver battalion operating in the security zone for 
reconnoitering the approaching enemy and observing results of 
artillery battalion (battery) fire on distant approaches. 
  Several fire position areas echeloned in the rear and along 
maneuver routes are selected and prepared in advance for the 
artillery battalion (battery) for the purpose of continuous 
support of combined-arms subunits in the security zone. In these 
cases, the artillery battalion (battery) usually carries out 
missions in support of combined-arms subunits from temporary 
fire positions. 
  In artillery repelling of an enemy attack, the 
artillery battalion (battery) uses concentrated fire, engagement 
of single targets, and creeping and fixed barrages to engage 
tanks and other armored vehicles, put the battle formations of 
enemy subunits in disarray, and create favorable conditions for 
destroying the enemy by fire from antitank weapons. Ahead of the 
forward edge of the defense, the artillery battalion (battery) 
uses a fixed barrage to cut the infantry off from the tanks and 
destroy it. As a rule, the artillery battalion (battery) 
executes the fire missions from the primary fire positions on 
commands of the senior artillery commander (chief), on 
instructions from the commander of the supported combined-arms 
subunit, and also on the artillery battalion (battery) 
commander's initiative. Repelling an enemy attack at the 
forward edge of the battle area is the most important mission of 
artillery in a defensive action. Since the enemy will always try 
to conceal his measures for preparing for an offensive, the 
mission of repelling his attack may arise unexpectedly. In this 
connection, a high degree of readiness is required of every 
artillery subunit to ensure opening of fire in the shortest 
possible time. 
  In artillery support of defending troops in the 
rear, the artillery battalion uses concentrated fire and 
engagement of single targets to engage an enemy who has wedged 
in, and it uses barrage fire to prevent the enemy from spreading 
deep into the defense, to cover exposed flanks, and to 
concentrate fire and efforts on destroying enemy tanks. The 
artillery battalion (battery) carries out the fire missions from 
primary and alternate fire positions. The artillery battalion 
maneuvers to the alternate fire position area on the command or 
by authority of the senior artillery commander (chief) or 
combined-arms commander. 
  Fire engagement of the enemy when conducting a 
counterattack is accomplished by the artillery battalion 
(battery) during periods of artillery support of forward 
movement of troops, artillery preparation of a counterattack, 
and artillery support of a counterattack (Figure 24). 




    During the period of artillery support of the forward 
movement of troops, the artillery battalion destroys and 
neutralizes artillery and mortar batteries and other targets 
that are capable of using their fire to impede the advance of 
subunits for a counterattack. During artillery preparation of a 
counterattack, the artillery battalion destroys and neutralizes 
enemy antitank and other weapons, tanks, and personnel on the 
axis of the counterattack, as well as newly detected artillery 
and mortar batteries. Artillery preparation of a counterattack 
begins no later than when counterattacking subunits reach the 
limit of the zone of effective enemy antitank fire and ends when 
they reach the troop safety line. It may consist of one shelling. 
  During the period of artillery support of a counterattack, 
the artillery battalion destroys and neutralizes personnel and 
weapons on the axis of the counterattack and on the flanks; in 
so doing, it uses, as a rule, concentrated fire and engagement 
of single targets. 
  After the counterattack has been conducted and the position 
restored, the artillery battalion carries out fire missions to 
consolidate the captured line. 
  The nature of the terrain, probable enemy actions, and the 
fire capabilities of artillery subunits are taken into account 
when preparing fire in a defense. Fire is prepared both against 
specifically reconnoitered targets and against places it is 
expected (assumed) the enemy will appear. Prepared fire is 
updated as new reconnaissance data on the enemy are received. 
  The artillery battalion designates a primary and one or two 
alternate fire position areas for carrying out fire missions in 
a defensive action. In addition, a temporary fire position area 
may be designated. In the primary area, at least two fire 
positions are selected for each battery, which enables gun 
platoons to execute a maneuver during combat. The fire positions 
are selected primarily on likely avenues of tank approach so 
that batteries can destroy enemy tanks with direct fire in the 
event they penetrate deep into the defense. Approaches to the 
fire positions may be covered by antitank mines. The fire 
positions should make it possible to fire with large shifts from 
the baseline and have an all-around field of direct fire. 
  Alternate fire position areas are designated on the flanks 
of 
the primary fire position area and in the depth of the defense. 
  Temporary battery fire positions are selected closer to the 
forward edge of the defense, and beyond the forward edge of the 
defense for supporting combined-arms subunits operating in the 
security zone or defending the forward position. 
  Command and observation posts are deployed on the terrain 
prior to the start of an enemy attack, and command vehicles are 
placed in shelters. Lateral observation posts are usually 
deployed in the artillery battalion to conduct reconnaissance of 
the enemy on a broad front. Engineer preparation of sites for 
command and observation posts and fire positions, as well as 
preparation of routes for maneuver is of special importance in 
the defense. 
  Gun platoons and command and observation (observation) posts 
are staggered in depth and dispersed laterally to increase the 
stability and survivability of the artillery battalion's battle 
formation. 
  When going over to a defensive action in direct contact with 
the enemy, an artillery battalion supporting a first-echelon 
motorized rifle battalion must change occupied fire positions 
after executing fire missions for consolidating a captured line 
and covering a regrouping of combined-arms subunits. Depending 
on the sequence of subsequent actions, batteries deploy at the 
primary area or in the temporary fire position area. 
  Roving subunits (batteries, platoons) and guns (mortars, 
combat vehicles) are used to mislead the enemy with respect to 
the amount of artillery and its locations (fire positions). It 
is advisable to assign subunits of self-propelled artillery as 
roving subunits. The artillery battalion commander organizes the 
actions of roving subunits based on instructions from the senior 
artillery commander (chief). 
  A roving subunit is assigned a fire position area to show 
the 
presence of several batteries there. This subunit carries out 
this mission by conducting a maneuver from one fire position to 
another and by firing from them to neutralize the most important 
targets (command posts, radars, artillery and mortar batteries, 
ATGM launchers, and other weapons) and to shell crossings and 
road junctions. A command and observation post of this battery 
is designated for fire control of the roving subunit. To 
increase survivability, the roving subunit should immediately 
abandon the occupied fire position after finishing firing and 
move to another position (or to a waiting area near another fire 
position). The fire positions of roving subunits are prepared so 
as to have all the elements of a battery deployed at a fire 
position. 
<H5>  Preparation for Combat Operations </H5>
  The sequence and content of the work of the artillery 
battalion commander and staff (battery commander) to prepare 
combat operations depend on the conditions of changing to a 
defensive action, the mission received, enemy operations, the 
nature of the terrain, and the time available. 
  When going over to a defensive action in conditions of 
direct 
contact with the enemy, the artillery battalion, in accordance 
with the mission received, may support the same maneuver 
battalion with which it operated earlier, or it may be assigned 
to support another battalion. 
  In the first instance, the artillery battalion is deployed 
into battle formation, reconnaissance and command and control 
have been organized, coordination is maintained (artillery 
battalion and battery commanders are located together with 
company and battalion commanders), fire has been prepared to 
consolidate the line already achieved, and the terrain has been 
studied. Further work for preparing combat operations of this 
artillery battalion is considerably facilitated. 
  In the second instance, preparation of the artillery 
battalion for combat operations will take place under more 
difficult conditions. Based on the mission assigned by the 
senior artillery commander (chief), the artillery battalion 
commander should arrive in the new area and report to the 
commander of the maneuver battalion to which the artillery 
battalion is attached or which it is supporting, receive the 
mission from him, carry out measures for organizing combat 
operations in a short period of time, and move the artillery 
battalion to the newly assigned area. All this work is 
accomplished while the artillery battalion continues to support 
the operations of the previous maneuver battalion. A variant 
of the sequence of the artillery battalion commander's work to 
prepare his battalion's combat operations in these conditions is 
shown in Figure 25. 




    Consequently, the limited time for preparing combat 
operations when changing to a defensive action, the need to 
leave commanders at the command and observation posts to provide 
fire control for batteries deployed into battle formation, and 
consideration of other situation conditions require the 
artillery battalion commander and chief of staff to have a 
creative approach to determining measures for preparing the 
artillery battalion's combat operations and the time sequence of 
their execution. 
  The experience of field training exercises shows that a 
maneuver battalion usually consolidates at the line it has 
reached in that battle formation in which it attacked. It may 
capture more favorable positions to improve its situation. 
Holding and consolidating the occupied line, the maneuver 
battalion's subunits may repel enemy attacks. Individual 
subunits may be withdrawn to the rear to more favorable 
positions. In supporting the maneuver battalion's combat, the 
artillery battalion continuously conducts reconnaissance and 
engages enemy infantry, tanks, antitank weapons, and other 
targets. To consolidate the line that has been reached, the 
artillery battalion commander must prepare concentrated fire to 
engage the enemy at attack positions, barrage fire (fixed and 
creeping) to repel his attacks, and also fire to engage the most 
important targets. In these conditions, the artillery battalion 
commander usually assigns missions to subunits from the map by 
means of separate orders. Subsequently, as soon as the situation 
permits, the artillery battalion commander participates in the 
supported maneuver battalion commander's reconnaissance and 
updates the missions to the batteries on the terrain. 
  The artillery battalion chief of staff provides substantial 
assistance to the artillery battalion commander in conditions of 
a limited time for preparing combat operations of gun platoons. 
  When going over to a defensive action out of direct contact 
with the enemy, taking into account the distance and nature of 
his actions, the defense may be prepared in a more planned 
manner and, as a rule, with more time available. In such 
conditions, the artillery battalion commander receives the 
mission from the senior artillery commander (chief) and the 
commander of the supported maneuver battalion usually directly 
on the terrain during ground reconnaissance. 
  During subsequent work, the artillery battalion commander, 
together with the battery commanders and staff officers, studies 
in detail the terrain, code names of local features, and 
reference points; the enemy's situation, possible avenues of 
advance, and lines of deployment; the disposition of the defense 
of the maneuver battalion (companies), concealed approaches to 
strongholds and locations of artificial obstacles, and axes of 
second-echelon counterattacks. He updates the artillery 
battalion (batteries) fire missions and missions being carried 
out by assets of the senior commander (chief) and other 
artillery subunits, organizes the selection of command and 
observation post sites and updates missions for reconnoitering 
the enemy, and determines the extent and sequence of engineer 
preparation. 
  As a rule, the operation order is issued in the area of 
deployment of the command and observation post. Coordination 
with combined-arms subunits and between batteries is worked out. 
  If the artillery battalion is located in the assembly area, 
the artillery battalion withdraws the gun platoons to the 
designated fire position area at the prescribed time and deploys 
them into battle formation. In accordance the artillery 
battalion commander's instructions, the chief of staff plans the 
artillery battalion's combat operations; organizes 
reconnaissance, topogeodetic survey and engineer preparation of 
the primary, alternate, and temporary fire positions; checks the 
timeliness of relocation of gun platoons to the designated fire 
positions, their preparation for executing the assigned 
missions, and organization of self-defense; arranges 
determination of firing data, receipt of the weather service 
message for medium artillery, and the operation of the attached 
radar; and takes steps to replenish the batteries' ammunition 
and other supplies. 
  Let us examine in a tactical example the work of the 
artillery battalion commander and staff for preparing the 
artillery battalion's combat operations when going over to a 
defensive action in direct contact with the enemy. 
<H6>  Tactical Example 3 </H6>
<H5>  Initial Tactical Situation (Map, Figure 26) </H5>
  Having defeated the enemy in the primary defensive area, by 
the end of the second day our units are continuing to push 
foreward.. 




    The 2d Bn, 8th Motorized Rifle Regt [MRR], with a tank 
battalion (minus a tank company) and the 2d Bn, 5th Arty Regt, 
advancing in the regiment's first echelon in the direction of 
Zhuchki, Veshki, has the mission of routing enemy subunits 
trying to organize a defense on the hills in front of Veshki and 
seize Veshki. 
  At 1710 hours on 26 April, the battalion, operating in 
approach march formation, encountered stubborn resistance from 
withdrawing enemy subunits on the line of Hill 117.3, the 
precipice. The first-echelon companies and tanks are deployed 
into battle formation; they are conducting a firefight and are 
not advancing. 
  The 2d Arty Bn is in march column. The artillery battalion 
commander is located with the commander of the 2d Motorized 
Rifle Bn [MRB], and the battery commanders are located with the 
commanders of the supported companies (4th Btry with 4th 
Motorized Rifle Co [MRC], 6th Btry with the 5th MRC), and the 
5th Btry is the stand-by battery. The subunits have 0.8 units of 
fire of fragmentation-high-explosive rounds. The subunits 
suffered the following losses in previous fighting: 4th 
Btry--two guns; 5th Btry--one gun. 
<H5>  Repelling a Counterattack by Superior Enemy Forces </H5>
  At 1920 hours on 26 April, based on the mission received, 
the 2d MRB commander announced the decision, based on 
intelligence from the 2d Arty Bn commander: 
  --reconnaissance of all types has established a 
concentration 
of major enemy reserves in the vicinity of Gusevo, which is 15 
km northwest of Hill 117.3; a counterattack by them is expected 
in the direction of Veshki, Zhuchki in two-three hours or at 
dawn on 27 April; 
  --The 2d MRB with attached subunits as part of the regiment 
is to consolidate on the line reached, organize fire from all 
weapons, and repel a counterattack by superior enemy forces. The 
battalion's battle formation is in single echelon: the 4th MRC 
on the right, the 5th MRC on the left, and the 6th MRC in 
reserve. The 2d Arty Bn is to deploy into battle formation and 
prepare fire to repel the counterattack and cover the 
battalion's right flank. 
  Subunits of the 15th MRR are consolidating on the right at a 
distance of 2-2.5 km (not on diagram). 
  The 3d MRB is consolidating on the left, on a line along the 
bushes (exc.) and the swamp, after destroying encircled enemy 
subunits. 
  The antitank reserve is deploying on line... (see diagram). 
  Based on the 2d MRB commander's decision, the artillery 
battalion commander gave the command for the artillery battalion 
to deploy into battle formation. The artillery battalion 
commander learned the following from the RAG commander's 
instructions. To repel the enemy counterattack, prepare: 
concentrated fire against target 80: x = 42,810, 
y = 74,650; concentrated fire against target 82: 
x = 43,640, y = 75,550; creeping barrage 
"Giyena" and "Giyena-1": right x = 43,860, 
y = 76,720; left x = 43,270, y 
= 76,610; "Giyena-2": right x = 43,615, y 
= 77,575; left x = 43,160, y = 77,310; 
"Giyena-3": right x = 43,460, y = 78,170; 
left x = 43,010, y = 77,840. Prepare fire 
additionally on his own decision. 
  In the event of repelling the enemy counterattack at night, 
be prepared to illuminate the line Hill 117.3, Hill "Vysokaya." 
  Readiness for fire is at 2000 hours on 26 April. By 2100 
hours, 0.3 units of fire of fragmentation-high-explosive rounds 
and 0.1 units of fire of illumination rounds will be delivered 
to the fire positions. 
  The 1st Arty Bn is to prepare fire in front of the 2d MRB: 
concentrated fire against target 81: x = 42,280, 
y = 74,310; concentrated fire against target 83: 
x = 42,340, y = 75,670; creeping barrage 
"Giyena-1, 2, and 3" on the left of the 2d Arty Bn's zone. 
  The artillery battalion made the following decision: 
  1. For support of the companies, leave the distribution of 
batteries as before. 
  2. Involve all batteries to carry out fire missions assigned 
by the RAG commander; prepare concentrated fire against targets 
80 and 82 by batteries with overlapping fire; prepare fixed 
barrage "Bereza" to repel a counterattack from the front and 
fixed barrage "Akatsiya" and "Vishnya" to cover the flanks, 
using all batteries for each of them; prepare concentrated fire 
against target 71 on Hill 121.4 to engage the enemy at the 
junction with the 3d MRB, using overlapping fire by the 5th and 
6th Batteries; use the 2d Gun Platoon of the 5th Btry to carry 
out the mission of illuminating the line Hill 117.3, Hill 
"Vysokaya." 
  3. Assign battery commanders and the intelligence officer 
missions for reconnoitering the enemy on the line reached and 
for timely detection of the enemy's shift to a counterattack. 
  4. Assign the chief of staff missions: for preparing the 
artillery battalion's fire; for organizing self-defense of gun 
platoons in the event of a breakthrough by enemy tanks into the 
fire position area and to coordinate the actions of the 6th Btry 
with the antitank reserve; for an even allocation of the 
delivered ammunition among batteries and for giving the 
illumination rounds to the 5th Btry. 
  5. Issue instructions for preparing subunits for night 
operations. 
  In accordance with the decision made, the 2d Arty Bn 
commander issued instructions to his subordinates and gave 
commands. 
  During daylight on 26 April and that night, maneuver 
battalion and artillery battalion subunits carried out measures 
to prepare to repel a counterattack, conducted reconnaissance 
and engineer preparation, and replenished ammunition. The 
artillery battalion commander used periodic illumination of the 
terrain for the purpose of reconnaissance. 
  Enemy aviation conducted reconnaissance of our troop 
dispositions. 
  At 0530 hours on 27 April (at dawn), the enemy began an 
artillery shelling, during which his tanks and armored personnel 
vehicles continued to move up toward the forward edge. 
Simultaneously, enemy aviation made bombing strikes against the 
reserves (second echelons), headquarters, and other 
installations of our troops. 
  The intelligence officer reported: "Reference point 4, right 
30, up 6, tanks." 
  The 2d Arty Bn commander gave the command: "`Kamen,' 
`Giyena-1' load," and 1.5 minutes later, "Fire." 
  Other artillery and mortar subunits opened fire on the left 
and right. Simultaneously, the enemy continued to deliver 
unabated artillery fire against the dispositions of our 
motorized rifle and tank subunits. 
  The enemy tanks continued to move, and the artillery 
battalion commander successively shifted fire from the first 
creeping barrage line to the second, and then to the third line. 
  All the maneuver battalion's weapons, including tanks, 
armored personnel vehicles, and ATGM's, joined battle to repel 
the enemy counterattack. A stubborn battle began, and enemy 
infantry dismounted. Six tanks are knocked out, and two of them 
were burning. 
  By 0730 hours on 27 April, as a result of fierce fighting, 
the enemy managed to penetrate into the dispositions of our 
subunits (see Figure 26). The antitank reserve and the 6th Btry 
entered the battle to destroy the enemy tanks by direct fire. 
  The 2d Arty Bn commander learned from information from the 
2d 
MRB commander that the enemy had penetrated 3-3.5 km deep into 
the dispositions of the adjacent subunit on the left during the 
counterattack. Up to a tank company with motorized infantry was 
pushing the counterattack at the junction between the 2d MRB and 
3d MRB, striving to break through to Dvoriki. 
  At 0820 hours on 27 April, following a seven-minute 
shelling, 
a counterattack is conducted by the regiment's second 
echelon--the 1st MRB--from the line along Hill 118.4, the 
crossroads in the direction of the crossroads and Hill 121.4 to 
prevent their further advance and to destroy the enemy that had 
penetrated. 
  The command came from the RAG commander: "`Kamen.' 
Attention, 
a seven-minute shelling. Readiness at 0810 hours. Target 76, 
sheltered infantry. Neutralize: x = 41,155, 
y = 78,140, elevation 121. 250 x 200. Expenditure 
1/4 norm. This is `Viskoza.'" 
  The artillery battalion commander gave the command: "`Vesna' 
(4th Btry), `Vichuga' (5th Btry). Attention, a seven-minute 
shelling. Readiness at 0810 hours. Target 76, sheltered 
infantry. Neutralize: x = 41,155, y = 
78,140, elevation 121. Overlapping fire. 250 x 200, two 
settings. Expenditure 126 per battery. This is `Kamen.'" 
  The artillery battalion opened fire at the prescribed time. 
The 1st Arty Bn began to neutralize targets simultaneously. When 
the shelling ended, the 1st MRB went over to a counterattack. A 
stubborn firefight began. The 1st MRB began moving slowly in the 
direction of Hill 121.4. 
  By 1020 hours subunits of the 1st MRB, supported by fire 
from 
the 1st and 2d artillery battalions, the regiment's antitank 
reserve, and a mortar battery of the 2d MRB, were pressing the 
enemy but were unable to seize Hill 121.4. Enemy resistance 
increased, and the maneuver battalion was halted on the line it 
had reached. As a result of the counterattack conducted by major 
enemy forces and its being repelled by our forces, both sides 
suffered heavy losses. 
  The artillery battalion commander received a report from the 
chief of staff: "The 6th Btry knocked out three tanks and lost 
two guns; the batteries each have 0.3 units of fire left." 
  The firefight on the occupied line continues. 
<H5>  Organizing Combat Operations When Going Over to the Defense </H5>
  At 1200 hours on 27 April, the commander of the 2d Arty Bn, 
5th Arty Regt, learned from the mission assigned by the 2d MRB 
commander (Figure 27): as a result of the counterattack by 
superior forces, the enemy had penetrated into the dispositions 
of our subunits on a number of sectors. In the area of our 
adjacent unit on the right--the 9th MRR--the enemy was 
continuing to conduct active combat operations. After a 
regrouping of forces and assets, repeat attacks should be 
expected. A concentration of new enemy reserves has been 
detected 30-35 km to the west of Hill 117.3. Movement, 12-15 km 
deep, of two columns of tanks, armored personnel vehicles, and 
artillery into this area has been reconnoitered. An enemy attack 
is possible on the morning of 28 April. 




    The 2d MRB with a tank battalion (minus a tank company) and 
the 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, as part of the regiment shifts to 
defend the area of the ravine, Dvoriki, Zhuchki with the mission 
of preventing the enemy from breaking through in the directions 
of Hill 117.3, Zhuchki and Temnaya Grove, Zhuchki. The defense 
area is to be occupied by 2200 hours on 27 April. Subunits of 
the 1st MRB are to be replaced between 2100 and 2200 hours. 
Readiness of the defense is at 0600 hours on 28 April. 
  The decision for the defense will be announced at 1300 
hours. 
  The 1st MRB, 9th MRR, goes over to the defense on the right; 
the 3d MRB goes over to the defense on the left. The boundaries 
between them are... (see map, Figure 27). 
  At 1230 hours on 27 April, the 2d Arty Bn commander received 
the 8th RAG commander's operation order, from which he learned: 
  --located in the first echelon, the 2d MRB, 8th MRR, is 
going 
over to the defense as part of the regiment; 
  --the 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, is included as part of the 
8th RAG and is assigned to support the 2d MRB, 8th MRR. 
  The artillery battalions missions are: 
  --during artillery interdiction of the advance and 
deployment 
of enemy troops, it is to engage the columns, ready to deliver 
concentrated fire against targets 80, 82, and 84; 
  --during artillery repelling of the enemy attack, it is to 
engage the attacking enemy, ready to deliver creeping barrage 
"Giyena-1, -2, and 3" and "Volk-1, -2, and -3" and fixed barrage 
"Akatsiya," "Bereza," "Klen," and "Osina"; 
  --during artillery support of the defending troops in the 
rear, engage the enemy who has penetrated and be ready to 
deliver concentrated fire against targets 92 and 93 and fixed 
barrage "Pikhta"; 
  --fire engagement of the enemy during a counterattack of the 
8th MRR second echelon--10-minute shelling, ready to deliver 
concentrated fire against targets 94, 92, and 93. 
  The primary fire position area is: the bushes, Hill 112.2, 
"Sapog" Grove; the alternate fire position area is... (see map); 
the temporary fire position for one battery is at its own 
discretion. 
  The baseline of fire is grid azimuth 53-00. Readiness to 
open 
fire from the primary fire position area is 2330 hours on 27 
April. 
  Ammunition expenditure for the day of fighting is: 0.2 units 
of fire before the enemy goes over to the attack; 2.2 units of 
fire after the enemy goes over to the attack. This includes 0.3 
for artillery interdiction of the advance and deployment of 
enemy troops, 0.7 for artillery repelling of the enemy attack, 
0.7 for artillery support of the defending troops in the rear, 
and 0.5 for fire engagement of the enemy during the 
counterattack. 
  By 2300 hours on 27 April, 1.4 units of fire will be 
delivered to each battery's fire position; the rest of the 
rounds will be delivered by 0600 hours on 28 April. Opening of 
fire from the primary fire positions prior to the start of the 
enemy attack is by authorization of the group commander. 
  The artillery battalion commander plotted the artillery 
battalion's fire missions on the work map, after which he 
learned from the 2d MRB commander's decision: the 2d MRB in the 
defense is concentrating primary efforts on the Veshki, Zhuchki 
axis. Stability of the battalion defense area depends on holding 
the line from Hill 118.4, to the crossroads, to Zhuchki. 
  The maneuver battalion's battle formation is in two 
echelons: 
the 4th and 5th MRC's in the first echelon; the 6th MRC in the 
second echelon. It is to have a tank company and mortar battery 
in direct subordination. Three company strongholds, antitank 
weapon positions, and a mortar battery fire position are to be 
created in the defense area. 
  Fire of organic and attached weapons is to be used to engage 
the enemy during his advance and deployment from the axes of 
Veshki, Hill 118.4 and "Temnaya" Grove, Zhuchki. Artillery and 
mortar subunits are to prepare concentrated fire and a creeping 
barrage for this purpose. When engaging the attacking enemy, 
artillery and mortar subunits are to prepare a fixed barrage and 
motorized rifle companies are to prepare sectors of concentrated 
fire on the following axes: Hill 117.3, Hill 118.4; Hill 121.4, 
Hill 118.4; Hill 121.4, Dvoriki. Antitank fire is to be prepared 
on these same axes. The fire of all artillery subunits, 
motorized rifle companies, and antitank weapons is to be used to 
engage the enemy in the event he penetrates into the defense 
area. 
  The combat missions of the subunits are: 
  --the 4th MRC with a tank platoon is to defend the 
stronghold 
(see map) and prevent a breakthrough of enemy motorized infantry 
and tanks in the direction of Hill 117.3, and Hill 118.4. 
  The maneuver battalion's right flank is to be secured by 
fire 
from a motorized rifle platoon and by company machineguns. 
  The 5th MRC with a tank company (minus a tank platoon) is to 
defend the stronghold (see map) and prevent a breakthrough of 
enemy motorized infantry and tanks in the direction of "Temnaya" 
Grove, Zhuchki. 
  The gap with the 3d MRB is to be secured by fire from the 
motorized rifle platoon. 
  The 6th MRC is the second echelon and is to defend the 
stronghold (see map). It is to be ready to reinforce the defense 
on the axis Hill 121.4, Zhuchki and to conduct a counterattack 
from line (exc.) Hill 118.4, (exc.) Zhuchki in the direction of 
the bushes, Hill 121.4. 
  The tank company is in direct subordination. It is to be 
positioned in the vicinity of the crossroads and be ready to 
reinforce the antitank fire of the first-echelon companies from 
the disposition area and from the line of fire positions--500 
meters north of the crossroads. 
  The 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, and the mortar battery are to 
interdict the enemy advance and deployment from the direction of 
Veshki, Zhuchki; engage the attacking enemy and in coordination 
with fire of companies and antitank weapons repel the attack by 
enemy motorized infantry and tanks; secure by fire the gap with 
the 1st MRB, 9th MRR; engage the enemy who has penetrated into 
the defense; and support the counterattack by the 6th MRC. 
  After clarifying the mission received, the artillery 
battalion commander determined the measures that had to be 
carried out immediately: 
  --give instructions: to the chief of staff--for preparing 
and 
dispatching an artillery reconnaissance group to select fire 
positions in the new area and about his arrival at the artillery 
battalion command and observation post; to the intelligence 
officer--on determining on the terrain the location of targets 
assigned to the artillery battalion; 
  --outline (personally) the fire positions for each battery 
in 
the primary and alternate areas and the temporary fire position 
for one battery. 
  Next the artillery battalion commander calculated the time 
available for preparing the artillery battalion for combat 
operations (Table 18).

  At 1330 hours the artillery battalion commander gave the 
instructions: "To the chief of staff--at 1440 hours 27 April, 
dispatch the artillery reconnaissance group to the primary fire 
position area, where it is to select two fire positions for each 
battery: 4th Btry--the bushes (4,524) and south 500 meters; 5th 
Btry--the two trees and east 500 meters; the 6th Btry--Hill 
112.2 and south 500 meters; the temporary fire position for the 
6th Btry--500 meters south of Zhuchki. The base fireline is grid 
azimuth 53-00. Perform topogeodetic survey according to the map 
by 1900 hours 27 April. Assign the mission to the artillery 
reconnaissance group personally. Arrive at the artillery 
battalion command and observation post by 1530 hours. To the 
intelligence officer--determine according to available 
coordinates the position on the terrain of the concentrated 
fire, creeping barrage, and fixed barrage being prepared." 
  At 1350 hours, the artillery battalion commander issued 
instruction to the battery commanders: "From positions occupied, 
subunits of the 2d MRB are to prepare to repel repeat enemy 
counterattacks. The batteries are to be ready to open fire 
immediately against the prepared concentrated fire and fixed 
barrage sectors. Arrive at the artillery battalion command and 
observation post by 1630 hours 27 April to be briefed on the 
mission. Headquarters platoon commanders are charged with 
command and control of batteries during this period." 
<H5>  Situation Assessment </H5>
  The enemy, as a result of a counterattack by 
superior forces, was pressing our subunits in a number of 
sectors. The enemy continues to conduct active combat 
operations. After a regrouping, using the forces and assets 
located in direct contact (after the counterattack) and 
concentrated in the rear, the enemy is capable of going over to 
the attack on the morning of 28 April. 
  In the time available, it is necessary to plan and prepare 
artillery battalion fire to repel the enemy attack, organize and 
conduct reconnaissance of the enemy, perform engineer 
preparation of the fire positions and command and observation 
post sites, organize local security and self-defense, and 
replenish subunits' ammunition. 
  The main tasks of reconnaissance are: timely detection of 
the 
start of the regrouping of the enemy located in direct contact; 
determination of battery coordinates; and detection of the enemy 
moving up from the rear. 
  Friendly Subunits. The 2d MRB, 8th MRR, with a 
tank company is moving to a defensive action in the regiment's 
first echelon on the important likelihood of a tank approach. 
The battalion's battle formation is in two echelons. To occupy 
the strongholds assigned to the companies, a regrouping will be 
made that must be covered by the artillery battalion's fire, for 
which the earlier prepared fire will be used. 
  Adjacent Units. The 1st MRB, 9th MRR, goes over to 
the defense on the right. The 3d MRB, 8th MRR, goes over to the 
defense on the left. The artillery battalion prepares fixed 
barrage "Akatsiya" to cover the gap with the 1st MRB, 9th MRR. 
It is necessary to task the 4th Btry commander to conduct 
reconnaissance in this gap. 
  A counterattack by the 8th MRB second echelon is planned in 
the direction of Sapog Grove, Mound 3, and it is planned to 
deploy the antitank reserve immediately on two lines. It is 
necessary to coordinate the actions of the 6th Btry gun platoons 
with the antitank reserve for destroying enemy tanks in the 
event they break through into the fire position area and to 
update on the terrain the concentrated fire being prepared 
against targets 91, 92, and 93 to support the counterattack by 
the regiment's second echelon. 
  Status of the Artillery Battalion. The artillery 
battalion is battleworthy. However, the existing losses (two 
guns in the 4th Btry, one in the 5th Btry, and two in the 6th 
Btry) reduce the artillery battalion's fire capabilities 
considerably. It is necessary to requisition replacements for 
the guns lost. 
  Keep the previous batteries in support of the 4th and 5th 
MRC's and have the 5th Btry as standby. The artillery 
battalion's fire capabilities are shown in Table 19.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The fire missions assigned to the artillery battalion by the 
senior chief are to be updated on the terrain. Preparation of 
the battalion for combat operations is to be accomplished 
according to the time breakdown. 
  The terrain in the battalion defense area and the 
fire positions is accessible for enemy tank attacks. It is 
necessary to prepare gun platoons to destroy enemy tanks that 
have broken through deep into the defense and also to make the 
best use of the terrain's protective features. 
  The distance between the primary and alternate fire position 
areas is 2.5 km; each battery will require 35-40 minutes to 
maneuver. 
  Hill 121.4 is the dominant elevation on this terrain in the 
enemy's dispositions; it provides a view of the dispositions of 
our subunits to Zhuchki. Steps must be taken for thorough 
camouflage. Prepare illumination of the line Hill 117.3, Hill 
121.4 for conducting reconnaissance of the enemy at night. 
  Each battery is to have 0.25 units of fire. Delivery of at 
least 1.0 unit of fire of fragmentation-high-explosive rounds 
and 50-70 illuminating rounds must be arranged as quickly as 
possible. Existing ammunition is to be expended by authority of 
the artillery battalion commander or chief of staff. 
<H5>  Artillery Battalion Commander's Decision </H5>
  1. Assign the 4th Btry to support the 4th MRC, 6th Btry to 
support the 5th MRC, and the 5th Btry as standby. 
  2. Battery fire missions: 
  --during artillery interdiction of the advance and 
deployment 
of enemy troops, batteries as part of the artillery battalion 
are to engage the columns, ready to deliver concentrated fire 
against targets 80, 82, and 84; 
  --during artillery repelling of an enemy attack, batteries 
as 
part of the artillery battalion are to engage the attacking 
enemy, ready to deliver creeping barrage "Giyena-1, -2, and -3" 
and "Volk-1, -2, and -3" and fixed barrage "Akatsiya," "Bereza," 
"Klen," and "Osina" (other than 4th Btry); 
  --during artillery support of the defending troops in the 
rear, batteries as part of the artillery battalion are to engage 
the enemy who has penetrated, ready to deliver concentrated fire 
against targets 92 and 93 and fixed barrage "Pikhta"; to secure 
the gap with the 1st MRB, 9th MRR, use fixed barrage "Akatsiya" 
and prepare concentrated fire against target 85, and use the 4th 
and 5th batteries; 
  --batteries as part of the artillery battalion and 
independently are to engage the enemy during the counterattack 
by the second echelon of the 8th MRR, ready for a 10-minute 
shelling by concentrated fire against targets 94, 92, and 93; 
  --for conducting reconnaissance of the enemy and repelling 
surprise enemy attacks at night, prepare from the temporary fire 
position periodic illumination of the terrain in the areas: 
"Svet-1"-- x = 43,250, y = 77,800, 800 x 
800; "Svet-2"-- x = 41,500, y = 77,850, 
1,500 x 800. 
  3. Fire position areas are those assigned earlier. 
  Have command and observation posts as follows: for the 
artillery battalion and 5th Btry--on Hill Malaya by 2030 hours 
27 April; for 4th and 5th batteries--together with command and 
observation posts of supported companies by 2100 hours 27 April. 
Deploy the fire control post in the primary fire position area 
of the 5th Btry. The 5th Btry's command and observation post is 
tasked with surveillance of the gap between the 2d MRB, 8th MRR, 
and the 1st MRB, 9th MRR, and calling in and adjusting fixed 
barrage "Akatsiya" and concentrated fire against target 85. The 
command and observation posts of the artillery battalion and 
batteries are to relocate simultaneously with the relocation of 
the maneuver battalion and company commanders. 
  The gun platoons are to relocate as follows: the 4th 
Btry--to 
the primary area between 2200 and 2330 hours; the 6th Btry--to 
the primary area between 2230 and 2300 hours; and the 5th 
Btry--to the temporary fire position between 2300 and 2330 hours 
27 April. 
  The procedure and signal for assuming command and control of 
the artillery battalion in the event the command and observation 
post is knocked out (until the chief of staff arrives) are as 
established earlier. 
  The chief of staff arrived at the artillery battalion 
command 
and observation post at 1515 hours 27 April and reported to the 
artillery battalion commander that the artillery reconnaissance 
group for reconnaissance of fire positions had been dispatched 
on time, a requisition had been made for replacing the five guns 
lost and for delivery of ammunition, and an excerpt from the 8th 
RAG's fire plan had been received. 
  The artillery battalion commander studied the excerpt from 
the 8th RAG's fire plan, briefed the chief of staff on the 
mission received, informed him of his decision, and gave the 
following instructions: 
  "Draw up a fire plan for the artillery battalion by 1630 
hours. Update the intelligence officer on the targets on the 
terrain. I am departing on commanders' reconnaissance with the 
commander of the 2d MRB. You are to remain in my place." 
<H5>  Work on the Terrain </H5>
  The artillery battalion commander participated in 
commander's 
reconnaissance with the maneuver battalion commander between 
1530 and 1630 hours. Prior to the start of the reconnaissance, 
he reported the strength, situation, status, and state of supply 
of the artillery battalion, the missions received from the 
artillery group commander for preparing fire (pointed them out 
on the terrain); supplementary fires prepared; the established 
ammunition expenditure (0.2 units of fire per day before the 
enemy goes over to the attack and 2.2 when the enemy goes over 
to the attack); the artillery battalion's fire capabilities 
(reports the content of Table 19); the primary, alternate, and 
temporary fire position areas (points them out on the map); the 
command and observation post sites: the artillery battalion 
command and observation post--by 2030 hours 27 April together 
with the command and observation post of the maneuver battalion 
on this hill (Hill "Fasol"), the battery command and observation 
posts--by 2100 hours 27 April together with commanders of the 
supported companies; gun platoons of the 5th and 6th Batteries 
relocate to the primary fire position area between 2200 and 2300 
hours and gun platoons of the 4th Btry to the temporary fire 
position between 2300 and 2330 hours 27 April. Readiness to open 
fire from the new fire positions is 2330 hours 27 April. 
  When organizing coordination, the maneuver battalion 
commander and the artillery battalion commander coordinated the 
actions of the companies with the artillery batteries and other 
weapons for engaging the enemy during the advance and deployment 
of his troops, during the repelling of his attack, and during 
support of the defending subunits in the depth. The 
commanders' attention was directed to clarifying the lines for 
opening fire by the subunits of ATGM's, tanks, armored personnel 
vehicles, grenade launchers, and other antitank weapons and also 
sectors of concentrated fire on the most important axes, fire 
missions for covering exposed flanks and gaps between 
strongholds, and coordinating the actions of subunits to destroy 
the enemy penetrating the battalion defense area. 
  Methods of target designation and warning, control, and 
coordination signals were agreed upon. 
  The artillery battalion commander and battery commanders 
arrived at the southern slopes of Hill Fasol at 1630 hours 27 
April. The chief of staff briefed the artillery battalion 
commander on the allocation of fire missions to the batteries. 
The artillery battalion commander conducted orientation on the 
terrain and then issued the combat order. 
  "1. The enemy has penetrated into the dispositions of our 
subunits on a number of sectors and is conducting active combat 
operations. Repeat enemy attacks should be expected after a 
regrouping of forces and assets. 
  "According to reconnaissance data, the enemy is 
concentrating 
reserves 30-35 km west of Hill 117.3. It is possible the enemy 
may go over to the attack on the morning of 28 April. 
  "2. The 2d MRB is going over to the defense of the area of 
the ravine, Dvoriki, Zhuchki with the mission of preventing an 
enemy breakthrough in the directions of Hill 117.3, Zhuchki and 
`Temnaya' Grove, Zhuchki. The battalion is concentrating its 
main efforts on holding the area of Hill 118.4, the crossroads, 
Zhuchki. 
  "The battalion's battle formation is in two echelons: in 
first echelon is the 4th MRC on the right and the 5th MRC on the 
left; the 6th MRC is in second the echelon. Companies are 
occupying the strongholds between 2100 and 2200 27 April. 
  "The 1st MRB, 9th MRR, is going over to the defense on the 
right; the boundary with it is... (he indicates it on the map 
and on the terrain). 
  "The 3d MRB, 8th MRR, is going over to the defense on the 
left; the boundary with it is... (he indicates it on the map and 
on the terrain). 
  "3. In the interests of the 2d MRB, artillery of the senior 
commander is to use concentrated fire to engage the enemy during 
advance and deployment and prepare a creeping barrage and fixed 
barrage to repel an enemy attack on the axis `Temnaya' Grove, 
Hill 121.4. 
  "4. The 2d Arty Bn, 5th Arty Regt, is part of the 8th RAG 
and 
supporting the 2d MRB, 8th MRR. Fire position areas are: 
primary..., alternate..., and temporary fire position for the 
5th Btry... (he indicates them on the map). The base fire line 
is grid azimuth 53-00. Fire for effect settings are to be 
determined by the full preparation method, and the maneuver 
route from the primary fire position area to the alternate is... 
(he indicates on the map). 
  "5. I order: 
  "a) The 4th Btry to support the 4th MRC defending the 
stronghold... (he indicates it on the map and on the terrain). 
During artillery interdiction of the advance and deployment of 
enemy troops, be ready to deliver concentrated fire against 
targets 80 and 82. During artillery repelling of the attack, be 
ready to deliver creeping barrage `Giyena-1, -2, and -3' and 
`Volk-1, -2, and -3' and fixed barrage `Akatsiya,' `Bereza,' and 
`Klen.' During artillery support of the defending troops in the 
rear, be ready to deliver concentrated fire against targets 92, 
93, and 95 and fixed barrage `Pikhta.' For fire engagement of 
the enemy during the counterattack, be ready to cover the second 
echelon's advance; during artillery preparation of the 
counterattack, conduct a 10-minute shelling of concentrated fire 
against target 94; during artillery support of the 
counterattack, deliver concentrated fire against targets 92 and 
93. Battery fire positions in the primary and alternate areas 
are... (he indicates them on the map). Relocating the battery to 
the primary fire position is between 2200 and 2230 hours 27 
April. Have the command and observation post come together with 
the 4th MRC command and observation post by 2100 hours 27 April. 
  "b) ...(Missions are assigned to the other subunits in a 
similar manner.) 
  "6. Ammunition expenditure for the defensive engagement is 
2.2 units of fire, including: 
  "--0.3 for artillery interdiction of the enemy advance and 
deployment; 
  "--0.7 for artillery repelling of the enemy attack; 
  "--0.7 for artillery support of the defending troops in the 
rear; 
  "--0.5 for fire engagement of the enemy during the 
counterattack. 
  "7. Readiness for opening fire from the primary fire 
position 
area and the temporary fire position is 2300 hours 28 April. 
  "8. The artillery battalion command and observation post is 
joined with the 2d MRB command and observation post on Hill 
Fasol from 2030 hours 27 April. The artillery battalion fire 
control post is at the fire position area of the 5th Btry from 
2230 hours 27 April. 
  "The procedure and signal for assuming command and control 
of 
the artillery battalion in the event its command and observation 
post and fire control post are knocked out of action are as 
established earlier." 
  Then the artillery battalion commander updates certain 
coordination matters: 
  "The companies occupy the strongholds between 2100 and 2200 
27 April. The batteries cover them during this time from the 
occupied fire positions. To repel a surprise enemy attack, the 
batteries are to have the following fixed barrages laid: 4th 
Btry--`Akatsiya'; 5th Btry--`Bereza'; 6th Btry--`Vishnya.' 
  "After the batteries occupy the primary fire positions, they 
are to open fire from them prior to the start of an enemy attack 
only by my authority. 
  "The enemy's use of weapons of mass destruction is possible 
before going over to the attack. In batteries subjected to the 
effects of nuclear weapons, immediately organize assistance for 
victims, mop up the after-effects of the nuclear strike, and 
restore combat effectiveness, for which each battery is to have 
15-man rescue teams headed by gun platoon commanders. 
  "The warning signal for an immediate threat and the 
beginning 
of employment of weapons of mass destruction by the enemy is 
`Kometa.' On this signal, personnel and instruments in batteries 
not carrying out fire missions are to take shelter in 
emplacements and bunkers. 
  "When conducting reconnaissance, continuously observe 
antitank minefields in front of the forward edge. Immediately 
report to me if you detect lanes being cleared in them. 
  "Repel the enemy attack with a fixed barrage. Open fire on 
my 
command, and independently, and do so with maximum intensity. 
Prior to the start of the enemy attack, especially at night, the 
battery guns at the primary fire positions are to be laid on the 
prearranged fixed barrage. 
  "Prepare gun platoons for firing against tanks that might 
break through into the fire position area. Instructions on 
organizing self-defense of gun platoons will be given to the 
senior battery officers by the chief of staff. 
  "Maneuver within the primary and to the alternate fire 
position area only on my command (signal `Lafet'). Relocate the 
command and observation post on signal `Kompas.' Warning signals 
are those previously established." 
  Organizing combat support, the artillery battalion commander 
issues reconnaissance instructions: 
  "Conduct reconnaissance as follows: 4th Btry--in the 
following zone: on the right--the northern slopes of Hill 
118.4, the northern slopes of Hill 117.3; on the left--the 
southern slopes of Hill 118.4, the road with the bushes; 6th 
Btry--in the following zone: on the right--the crossroads, the 
northern slopes of Hill 121.4; on the left--the road with the 
trees; the artillery battalion command and observation post and 
the 5th Btry--in the following zone: on the right--the southern 
slopes of Hill 118.4, the hollow with the bushes; on the 
left--the crossroads, Hill 121.4. 
  "Reconnaissance missions: disclose the fire positions of 
artillery and mortar batteries in the vicinity of the bridge, 
Hill Vysokaya, and the hill with three trees; ascertain the time 
of concentration of the main enemy grouping in front of the 2d 
MRB defense area, its forces, and the axis of attack; 
reconnoiter the disposition of command posts on line Hill 117.3, 
Hill 121.4. 
  "An additional reconnaissance zone is assigned to the 4th 
Btry command and observation post to the right of Hill 118.4 and 
the ravine for observing the gap between the 1st MRB, 9th MRR, 
and the 2d MRB, 8th MRR, and for calling in fixed barrage 
`Akatsiya.'" 
  The artillery battalion commander also issued instructions 
for protection against weapons of mass destruction, camouflage, 
engineer preparation of the fire positions, and others. 
<H5>  Planning Combat Operations </H5>
  Based on the artillery battalion commander's instructions 
and 
the excerpt from the group fire plan, the chief of staff began 
planning the combat operations. 
  Fire Planning. The chief of staff plots on the map 
the targets and the artillery battalion's battle formation: 
command and observation post and observation post sites, primary 
battery fire positions, alternate and temporary fire positions, 
and prepared (planned) sites for the command and observation 
posts in case they relocate. He allocates fire missions among 
batteries. In so doing, he assigns several batteries to engage 
the most important targets. He draws up the fire plan (Table 20) 
and a list of target coordinates. 
  Maneuver Planning. He plots on the map (then 
updates on the terrain) the primary and alternate routes for 
relocating batteries to the alternate fire position area; 
calculates the time for the relocation (total time for leaving 
the occupied fire positions, relocating, and deploying at the 
new fire position); designates (announces the signal established 
by the artillery battalion commander) the relocation signal; and 
reflects the results of the calculations on the map. 
  By direction of the chief of staff and senior battery 
officers, the plotters calculate firing data for the planned 
targets and enter the results in the computed firing data table. 
Experience shows that computed data are calculated for the 
primary fire positions, and only topographic data are determined 
for the remaining fire positions. The chief of staff compares 
firing data calculated in the artillery battalion with the 
batteries' data.

  Organizing Local Security at Fire Positions. At 
1930 hours 27 April, the artillery battalion chief of staff 
arrived at the primary fire position area, listened to a report 
from the artillery reconnaissance group commander on the work 
done, approved the selected fire positions, wrote down their 
coordinates, and issued instructions to the gun platoon 
commanders on organizing local security and coordination of 
battery gun platoons: 
  "The primary avenue of likely tank approach: Hill 118.4, the 
northern outskirts of Zhuchki. A breakthrough of enemy tanks is 
also possible from the flanks. Zones of direct fire: 4th Btry: 
on the right--the yellow bushes, the double tree; on the 
left--the highway; 5th Btry: on the right--the wide bush, the 
ravine; on the left--the yellow trench, Hill 112.2; 6th Btry: on 
the right--Hill 112.2, the southern outskirts of Zhuchki; on the 
left--the burned tree, the small bush.

Chief of Staff, Capt (N. Suslov) 


  "Gun platoons of the 5th and 6th batteries destroy enemy 
tanks breaking through to the fire position area over the road 
from the direction of Zhuchki; tanks breaking through from the 
direction of the ravine and the 4th Btry fire position are 
destroyed by 4th Btry gun platoons in coordination with the 
antitank reserve, which is preparing deployment line No 
3--Nizhkiy Bushes toward two trees; if the tanks break through 
on the left from the direction of Dvoriki, Zhuchki, they are 
destroyed by the 6th Btry gun platoons. 
  "The senior officer of the 4th Btry is to coordinate actions 
of the gun platoons with the antitank reserve commander during 
his work on deployment line No 3. Each battery is to organize 
local security and self-defense at the fire position on 
instructions from the battery senior officers. Terrain sectors 
for mining are to be plotted. The self-defense plan is to be 
worked out by 2400 hours. Personnel training is to be conducted 
between 0130 and 0150 hours, during which time the crews 
practice actions for self-defense." 
  At 2045 hours 27 April, the chief of staff received the 
excerpt from the 8th RAG fire plan for the artillery battalion's 
participation in counterpreparation (Table 21). 
  Simultaneously, the following combat instruction was 
received 
from the 8th RAG Headquarters: "For the period 0030 to 2300 
hours 28 April, assign a roving platoon from the battery 
deployed at the temporary fire position. The platoon is to 
deliver fire from the fire positions abandoned by the 4th, 5th, 
and 6th Batteries. Carry out one to two fire missions from each 
fire position, neutralizing targets reconnoitered by the 
artillery battalion. Ammunition expenditure is 110 
fragmentation-HE rounds and 15 illuminating rounds. Equip the 
fire positions with mockup guns by 0600 hours 28 April. The 
operation plan for the roving platoon is to be submitted for 
approval by 2330 hours 27 April." 
  The chief of staff studies the documents received, briefs 
the 
artillery battalion commander on them, and updates the planning 
of combat operations. For this he plots the targets on the map 
and draws up a fire plan for artillery counterpreparation (Table 
22); he gives instructions to the plotters for calculating 
target firing data. 
  In planning the operations of the roving subunit, he 
designates a roving platoon from the 5th Btry, notes the time of 
firing and fire position numbers, determines the targets for

<H3>  Maintaining the Artillery Battalion's Readiness To Repel 
Enemy Attacks </H3>
  Both combined-arms and artillery subunits that have gone 
over 
to the defense in direct contact with the enemy will make 
maximum use of every opportunity for improving the positions 
occupied, equipping shelters, making a detailed study of the 
terrain, establishing alternate positions, and carrying out 
other measures in the interests of the defense. In doing so, the 
subunits must be ready to repel a surprise enemy attack at any 
moment. 
  The artillery battalion's readiness to repel an attack is 
expressed in its ability to open scheduled or unscheduled fire 
in a timely manner against attacking enemy tanks and motorized 
infantry, artillery, and mortar batteries, mop up in an 
organized manner the after-effects of the use of nuclear weapons 
by the enemy, and execute the necessary maneuver of fire and 
subunits. 
  To maintain the readiness of subunits, the artillery 
battalion commander determines specific measures and issues 
instructions to subordinate commanders. These measures include: 
conducting continuous reconnaissance; designating alert officers 
and scouts from the battery and artillery battalion command and 
observation posts in addition to observation posts; designating 
alert platoons (crews) in battery gun platoons; laying battery 
guns for barrage fire on the most important axis; precisely 
organized self-defense of gun platoons and constant training of 
personnel in actions in response to warning signals; maintaining 
equipment, motor transport, and instruments in working order and 
preparing ammunition for firing; maintaining stable 
communications; systematic updating of firing data in response 
to changes in firing conditions; locating off-duty personnel in 
prepared shelters near the guns; conducting classes and 
political-educational work with personnel; and also checking the 
readiness of subunits. 
  The artillery battalion commander and battery commanders are 
constantly a part of the the command and observation posts in 
addtion to observation posts; listen to subordinates on the 
results of reconnaissance; and personally observe the enemy day 
and night. They increase observation with the onset of darkness, 
at dawn, in fog, and in bad weather, assigning additional scouts. 
  Fire from roving artillery subunits is widely used to 
mislead 
the enemy concerning the number and location of our artillery. 
  In today's conditions, it is advisable to assign 
self-propelled artillery subunits as roving subunits. The 
experience of the Great Patriotic War confirms that roving 
subunits should fire not against enemy positions in general but 
against reliably reconnoitered targets in order to inflict the 
necessary damage on them. We will use an example to show 
this.[.sup]2[/] 
  On 26 March 1944, our troops had advanced to the 
vicinity of Pascani after making an assault crossing of the 
Siret River, and here they were stopped by organized enemy fire 
from a previously prepared defense line. After an unsuccessful 
attempt to break through the enemy defense, they were ordered to 
go over to the defense temporarily. 
  The 2d Bn, 676th Arty Regt, was supporting a battalion 
of the 694th Rifle Regt. The terrain was open and marshy in 
places in our defense sector, which made it difficult to select 
fire positions for the artillery. The only convenient place for 
firing positions was the northern outskirts of Pascani, which is 
where the primary fire positions of the 4th and 6th batteries 
were selected, and the 5th Btry was moved up for direct 
firing. 
  Two dummy fire positions were prepared for each battery 
in order to mislead the fascists as to the actual location of 
the primary fire positions. These positions as well as the 
primary positions were prepared by engineers. Gun mockups were 
set up at each position. One gun was to fire from each dummy 
position, so one of the gun emplacements was equipped with a 
reliable overhead cover to protect the crew and gun from being 
hit during an enemy artillery shelling if there was no time for 
the gun to leave the position after firing. 
  The artillery battalion commander received the 
operation plan for the roving guns from regimental headquarters. 
It called for assigning one gun each from the 4th and 6th 
batteries and gave the targets to be neutralized and the time 
for firing. Two of the four dummy fire positions had concealed 
approaches; therefore, fire was delivered from them only in the 
daytime and only at night from the remaining two. These fire 
positions also supported the regiment's reconnaissance groups 
operating at night. 
  The guns moved to another position after firing from 
the dummy position. The enemy opened heavy fire against the 
dummy positions, wasting a large number of shells. 
<H5>  Conducting Combat Operations </H5>
<H5>  Supporting the Maneuver Battalion at a Forward Position </H5>
  Combat operations to hold a forward position may begin with 
repelling an enemy attack from attack positions from direct 
contact or with destruction of approaching reconnaissance and 
forward enemy subunits moving up from the rear in the absence of 
contact. 
  The maneuver battalion organizes the defense at a forward 
position with individual company and platoon strongholds 
prepared for all-around defense and intercepting the most likely 
avenues of an enemy attack. A developed system of artificial 
obstacles is created. The intervals and often even gaps in the 
battle formations of the maneuver battalion's subunits are 
covered by fire from tanks, combat vehicles, and other weapons, 
ambushes are organized, and obstacles and barriers are erected. 
  The fire of an artillery battalion attached to or assigned 
to 
support a maneuver battalion is prepared on a general basis. 
Battery command and observation posts are deployed together with 
the commanders of the supporting companies, and the artillery 
battalion command and observation post is deployed with the 
maneuver battalion commander. Battery gun platoons deploy, as 
a rule, at temporary fire positions prepared usually between the 
first and forward positions. 
  The artillery battalion assigns one of the batteries to 
repel 
an attack by small enemy forces. The battery destroys the most 
important targets or repels the attack with barrage fire. 
  An attack by larger enemy forces following a brief artillery 
shelling should be expected to capture the forward position in 
order to move to the forward edge of our defense. The enemy 
attack is repelled by fire from all the maneuver battalion's 
forces and assets. Before the enemy goes over to the attack, the 
artillery battalion engages reconnoitered targets with 
concentrated fire and fire against single targets. When the 
enemy goes over to the attack, it is repelled by barrage fire. 
  The enemy who has penetrated to the forward position is 
destroyed by fire of subunits from the flanks, by the artillery 
battalion's concentrated fire, and by battery fire against 
single targets. Approaching enemy reserves in addition to his 
artillery and mortar batteries are neutralized by the senior 
commander's artillery. 
  The maneuver battalion leaves the forward position in an 
organized manner and only by authority of the senior commander. 
It is covered by fire of the attached (supporting) artillery 
battalion. 
  As a rule, gun platoons maneuver to the primary fire 
position 
area in succession on the command (signal) of the artillery 
battalion commander; this creates conditions for continuous 
engagement of the enemy. 
  The battery command and observation posts in addition to 
observation posts relocate to their designated locations at the 
first positions simultaneously with the maneuver of the gun 
platoons and supported companies. The artillery battalion 
command and observation post does so with the maneuver battalion 
command and observation post. The artillery battalion commander 
organizes uninterrupted fire control. In doing so, the commander 
accomplishes fire on the move. 
  After the gun platoons move to the primary fire position 
area 
and the battery and artillery battalion command and observation 
posts deploy at the first position, the artillery battalion may 
be assigned to support the first-echelon maneuver battalion or 
as the stand-by for the artillery group commander 
<H5>  Supporting a First-Echelon Maneuver Battalion </H5>
  The combat of a first-echelon maneuver battalion usually 
begins with repelling attacks by forward enemy subunits. The 
enemy's main body will move up and prepare for attack under 
cover of these subunits. The attack by the enemy's main body may 
begin from the positions occupied in direct contact or on the 
move with an advance from the depth. 
  Enemy reconnaissance in force is possible prior to the 
attack 
by the main body. The attempt to conduct reconnaissance in force 
is repelled by fire from the assigned assets of the defending 
subunits and artillery from temporary fire positions. 
  According to the plan of the senior commander (chief), the 
artillery battalion may take part in the artillery 
counterpreparation. 
  The shift of the enemy's main body to the attack is usually 
preceded by a powerful softening-up of our defense, including 
nuclear and chemical strikes, artillery fire, air strikes, and 
use of incendiary weapons. 
  On a signal warning of the immediate threat of the enemy 
using nuclear weapons, personnel of artillery subunits cover 
optical instruments and head for prepared shelters. After the 
blast wave passes, personnel leave the shelters and take up 
their positions. If necessary, the artillery battalion commander 
organizes the mop-up of the after-effects of the enemy's use of 
weapons of mass destruction and restoration of the artillery 
battalion's combat effectiveness. Subunit commanders monitor 
enemy actions and on the command of the senior commander or on 
their own initiative neutralize the enemy's offensive nuclear 
and chemical weapons, artillery batteries, tanks deploying for 
the attack, and motorized infantry (infantry). 
  Barrage fire is additionally prepared and, by decision of 
the 
senior commander, the antitank reserve and other subunits are 
moved up to cover the area against which the enemy has made a 
nuclear strike. 
  All weapons of the maneuver battalion and attached subunits 
take part in repelling the enemy attack. 
  The artillery battalion uses barrage fire to engage tanks 
and 
other armored vehicles, break up the battle formations of enemy 
subunits, cut off motorized infantry from the tanks, and force 
them to dismount. As a result, favorable conditions are created 
for destroying both armored enemy targets and his exposed 
personnel and weapons. If necessary, barrage fire is shifted for 
a short time to repel the attack on adjacent sectors. The 
artillery commander concentrates the fire of the entire 
artillery battalion or of most of the batteries on the most 
threatening part of the attacking enemy, particularly on the 
axis where the nuclear strike was made. He reports on enemy 
actions and the mission being carried out by the artillery 
battalion to the senior artillery commander (chief). 
  The battle to hold strongholds at the forward edge is waged 
with maximum intensity. 
  The enemy may penetrate into the maneuver battalion's 
defense 
on individual sectors. In these conditions, stubborn holding of 
strongholds is of great importance, and control of artillery 
battalion and battery fire is considerably more complicated. 
Individual command and observation posts may be knocked out of 
action, and others will be forced to move to new locations or 
end up encircled with subunits. In these conditions, realistic 
consideration of the existing capabilities, precisely worked out 
procedures for battery commanders to assume command and control 
of the artillery battalion, a high degree of organization by 
commanders, and brevity and preciseness of instructions being 
issued can ensure uninterrupted command and control of the 
artillery battalion. 
  In case the enemy breaks through into the depth of the 
defense, the maneuver battalion's second-echelon company must 
inflict decisive damage on him from the occupied prepared line 
and halt his further advance. Under favorable situation 
conditions, the enemy who has penetrated is destroyed by a 
counterattack. 
  We will show an artillery battalion's actions for repelling 
attacks in the defense by using a combat example from the Great 
Patriotic War.[.sup]3[/] 
  The artillery battalion commanded by Hero of the Soviet 
Union Senior Lieutenant Berezovskiy was supporting the offensive 
of a rifle regiment, which on 9 January 1944 had seized Tsybulev 
(Figure 28), but was halted by stubborn enemy resistance on the 
line along Polonskiy Farmstead and Vladislavchik. 




    Repeated attempts to break through the enemy's defense 
on this line were unsuccessful, and the regiment went over to 
the defense. The artillery battalion deployed at indirect-fire 
positions and prepared fire to repel enemy attacks. Having 
reconnaissance data showing that the enemy was concentrating a 
considerable number of tanks on this sector of the front and was 
preparing for an offensive, the artillery battalion commander 
organized an antitank defense of the fire positions, paying 
special attention to the likely avenue of tank approach of 
Polonskiy Farmstead--Tsybulev. By 16 January, the artillery 
battalion had completed antitank preparation of the fire 
positions and was ready to repel enemy attacks. 
  At 1200 hours 20 January, the Nazis attacked our 
positions with up to a battalion of infantry with 50 tanks and 
seized the Sovkhoz imeni 1-go Travnya, but were thrown back to 
the starting position by a counterattack of our subunits 
supported by the artillery battalion and did not undertake any 
attacks for several days. 
  At 0900 hours 25 January, up to 50 enemy tanks and 25 
armored personnel carriers began an offensive from the vicinity 
of Polonskiy Farmstead on Tsybulev following a heavy airstrike 
(seven raids by 30-50 aircraft each). When the enemy tanks 
reached the vicinity of Hill 252.2, the artillery battalion 
delivered a heavy shelling against them from indirect-fire 
positions. As a result, two tanks and two armored personnel 
carriers were knocked out and the battle formation of the 
attacking forces was broken up. One group of 20 tanks and 13 
armored personnel carriers turned toward Sharnopyl, and another 
group of 30 tanks and 10 armored personnel carriers tried to 
break through along a hollow to Tsybulev. 
  Taking advantage of the enemy confusion, the 6th Btry 
allowed the tanks to approach to a distance of 600 meters and 
opened direct fire. The first rounds knocked out three tanks 
and two armored personnel carriers, and then another two tanks 
and two armored personnel carriers. 
  Having encountered such withering fire from the 
battery, the fascists began to bypass it on the left, but came 
under heavy flanking fire by the 5th Btry, which knocked out 
four more tanks and two armored personnel carriers by direct 
fire. The enemy began to withdraw, but lost another tank to fire 
from the 6th Battery in doing so. 
  During the course of this battle, infantry and 
submachine gunners tried to penetrate to the battery's fire 
position, but these attempts were foiled by well-organized 
small-arms fire. 
  Thus, the enemy's path to Tsybulev was blocked thanks 
to the skilled and courageous actions of personnel of all 
batteries. In this battle, the enemy lost 10 tanks, 6 armored 
personnel carriers, and up to 160 soldiers and officers to fire 
from the artillery battalion. 
<H5>  Supporting a Second-Echelon Maneuver Battalion </H5>
  When conducting a counterattack, an artillery battalion may 
be assigned to support a second-echelon maneuver battalion or be 
attached to it. After receiving the mission from the senior 
artillery commander (chief), the artillery commander assigns 
missions to the battery commanders, updates missions for 
reconnoitering the enemy ahead of the counterattack line, moves 
the command and observation post to a new line if necessary, 
establishes personal contact with the maneuver battalion 
commander, and prepares the artillery battalion to execute the 
fire missions received. The artillery battalion uses 
concentrated fire and fire against single targets to cover the 
advance and deployment of second-echelon subunits, neutralizing 
primarily artillery and mortar batteries, as well as enemy 
antitank weapons, tanks, personnel, and weapons on the axis of 
the counterattack. The shelling begins no later than when the 
second-echelon subunits reach the limit of the zone of effective 
fire of enemy antitank weapons and concludes when the subunits 
reach the troop safety line. The duration of the shelling is 
determined the same way as during commitment of the regiment's 
second echelon in an offensive action. 
  When the companies reach the final coordination line for the 
counterattack, battery commanders establish personal contact 
with company commanders and subsequently relocate with them, 
carrying out assigned missions. The counterattacking subunits 
are supported by battery fire against single targets or by 
concentrated fire against the most important targets. 
  After conducting the counterattack and restoring the 
situation, the artillery battalion commander assigns a mission 
for preparing fire to consolidate the line that had been 
reached; he organizes a change in fire positions, their engineer 
preparation, and replenishment of ammunition and prepares the 
artillery battalion to repel repeat enemy attacks. 
  During the course of the defensive battle, the enemy will 
use 
a large number of tanks on the important axes. The possibility 
of individual groups breaking through to the artillery 
battalion's fire position area is not ruled out. Therefore, it 
is necessary to prepare the gun platoons deployed at 
indirect-fire positions to destroy the tanks that break through. 
Combat against tanks requires a great deal of courage, valor, 
coolness, and self-control of personnel. This is evidenced by 
numerous examples from the experience of the Great Patriotic War. 
  Success in combating enemy tanks is achieved by proper 
selection of the fire position and disposition of guns there, 
timely mining of the terrain on likely avenues of tank approach, 
posting observers and sentry posts, a high degree of training of 
personnel knowing the vulnerable spots of tanks and firing 
rules, and interchangeability of crew members. 
  Here is one combat example.[.sup]4[/] 
  On 10 March 1944, our units had made a forced crossing 
of the Siret River and, as a result of stubborn resistance by 
superior enemy forces on the west bank of the river, received 
the order to consolidate on the line they had reached. 
  The 1st Battalion, 203d Gds Heavy Howitzer Regiment was 
supporting a rifle battalion. Simultaneously with executing fire 
missions, the artillery battalion was working hard to prepare 
fire positions and command and observation post sites. There 
were foxholes in front of the fire positions for soldiers armed 
with antitank rifles and grenades. The battery command and 
observation posts in addition to observation posts were 
colocated with the commanders of the supported companies. The 
artillery battalion headquarters were deployed in the vicinity 
of the 1st Btry fire position. 
  On 13 March, after powerful artillery and air 
preparation, the enemy went over to the attack with forces of 
two infantry regiments supported by 20 tanks and 12 
self-propelled artillery guns. On 13 and 14 March, the enemy 
managed to press our rifle subunits; as a result, the gun 
platoons of all batteries were left without their cover. 
  The artillery battalion commander organized a defense 
of the command and observation post, and the chief of staff was 
ordered to organize a self-defense of the gun platoons. Terrain 
illumination posts were set up in case of a night attack by 
enemy tanks. 
  At 0900 hours 15 March, up to two infantry battalions 
with 15 tanks and five self-propelled guns, supported by 
artillery fire and airstrikes, attacked our subunits again. Our 
artillerymen approached to within 250-300 meters of the tanks 
and suddenly opened fire. After knocking out two tanks, the 3d 
Btry gun platoons were shelled by the self-propelled guns that 
were moving behind the tanks. Two guns in the battery took 
direct hits and were knocked out of commission. 
  During this same time, the 2d Btry guns knocked out one 
tank and one self-propelled gun. As a result, the fascist tanks 
turned back. 
  At 1130 hours, the fascists undertook a second attack. 
By this time the 3d Btry had two guns (one gun had been taken 
from the 1st Btry). 
  The tanks approached to within 300-400 meters of the 
fire positions. The 2d Btry knocked out one tank. All ammunition 
was expended in the 3d Btry, and the crews suffered heavy losses 
from fire from the self-propelled guns. A gunner, Private 
Peshkov, was at one of this battery's guns; he set fire to a 
Ferdinand self-propelled gun with the last accurate round. The 
rest of the tanks and self-propelled guns turned back and 
withdrew to the staging area. The valorous gunner Gds Private 
Peshkov died the death of the brave in this uneven battle. 
  At 1800 hours, the fascists again undertook an attack 
with infantry and tanks, supported by fire from an armored 
train. The situation was becoming critical. In such conditions, 
the artillery battalion commander, Captain Vrashev, rallied his 
personnel for a counterattack. The enemy was thrown back from 
the fire positions. The artillery battalion commander died a 
hero's death in hand-to-hand combat. 
  On 16 March, the fascists undertook several more 
attacks with small forces, which were successfully beaten back 
by artillery, machinegun, and rifle fire. 
  Thus, fighting courageously, over the course of three 
days the artillery battalion repelled the onslaught of a 
numerically superior enemy, inflicted heavy losses in personnel 
and equipment on him, and did not give up the occupied positions 
to the enemy. 
<H5>  Actions When Defending a Seacoast </H5>
  Defense of a seacoast is usually accomplished to prevent the 
landing of enemy amphibious or airborne assault forces on the 
coast and to hold (protect) important coastal installations. In 
the event of an enemy landing, defending units must destroy the 
enemy on the shore or push him out to sea. 
  A defense on a seacoast is based on holding the most 
important sectors (area) on axes of a likely landing of enemy 
assault forces. Subunits and units must ensure a high degree of 
activeness and stability, dispersal and concealed dispositions, 
protection against weapons of mass destruction, and also a broad 
maneuver of forces and assets along the coast and from the rear. 
  The main efforts are concentrated on firmly holding the 
coast, road junctions, commanding heights, and other 
installations that make it possible to break up an enemy assault 
force and destroy it in detail. Observation and patrolling are 
organized and artificial obstacles are set up on remote axes. 
  The forward edge of the defense should be located at a 
minimum distance from the water's edge, and on a low shore may 
reach into the depth to a more favorable line. Various obstacles 
are set up and antitank weapons are positioned in places 
accessible for a landing by amphibious tanks and infantry 
fighting vehicles. 
  Depending on the completeness of information on a probable 
enemy assault landing, a first-echelon motorized rifle battalion 
may occupy an assigned defense area or be ready to occupy it. In 
the latter case, work is continuously done to improve the 
engineer preparation of the area (Figure 29). 




    An important role in defending a seacoast belongs to 
artillery, since it is able to inflict damage on an enemy 
assault force at maximum ranges and during the approach to the 
shore. It can also engage an amphibious assault during the 
landing and fighting on the shore. 
  When defending a seacoast, an artillery battalion may be 
assigned to support a combined-arms unit (subunit) or be 
attached to it. A battery from the artillery battalion is 
usually assigned to support a combined-arms subunit. 
  Artillery subunits may carry out the following missions: 
prevent enemy reconnaissance of coastal waters and the shore, 
minesweeping, mineclearing, and removal of antiassault-landing 
obstacles; engage ships, transports, amphibious tanks, and other 
armored vehicles when they are approaching the shore; inflict 
damage on enemy airborne assault forces and forward units, 
preventing their landing on the coast; destroy tanks, motorized 
infantry, and artillery and mortar batteries that have landed on 
the shore; cover gaps between units (subunits) and their flanks; 
inflict damage on the enemy when conducting second-echelon 
(reserve) counterattacks; prevent the approach and landing of 
subsequent waves of an assault force and the approach of ships 
supplying the assault force. 
  The artillery battalion uses concentrated fire to engage 
ships and transports, personnel, and weapons in the area of 
loading, assembly, and forming of the assault waves. An attached 
surface search radar or a laser rangefinder is used to 
reconnoiter targets and adjust fire. 
  During movement toward the shore, the assault waves are 
engaged by a creeping barrage. It is prepared, taking into 
account the direction of the channel, the presence of shoals, 
reefs, and minefields, and the suitability of the coastline for 
an assault landing. The first (far) line is designated up to 
eight km from the shore, and the last line is designated at the 
direct-fire weapons' commence fire line. 
  Timely opening of fire is ensured by fixing the movement of 
the assault force using surface search radar. The leader in this 
area is informed of the polar coordinates of the centers of the 
lines from the radar's position and the average flight time of 
the rounds along each line. In the absence of radar, the lead 
assault-landing craft are fixed using a laser rangefinder by 
determining the front of the target and the deviation of the 
direction of its movement from the center of the creeping 
barrage line toward which it is moving. Fixing of the target is 
repeated periodically, and firing commences when the target 
approaches the creeping barrage line, making general adjustments 
for all batteries if necessary. 
  Amphibious tanks, armored personnel carriers, and 
assault-landing craft that make it out of the impact area at the 
final creeping barrage line are engaged by direct fire. 
  When the assault force approaches the shore, it is engaged 
by 
a fixed barrage, which is prepared against the water's edge or 
against the land close to the shore if the forward edge of the 
defense is away from the shore. 
  Concentrated fire by the artillery battalion is prepared in 
case the enemy lands on the shore; concentrated fire and a fixed 
barrage are prepared to prevent the enemy from spreading into 
the rear and the flanks. In addition, concentrated fire is 
prepared to support counterattacks. 
  The actions of the artillery battalion (batteries) when 
defending a seacoast are based on a broad maneuver of fire and 
subunits. Therefore, the artillery battalion prepares two and 
sometimes three creeping barrage zones and alternate battery 
fire positions, and one or two fire position alternate areas for 
maneuver. 
  The artillery battalion deploys into battle formation on the 
likely axis of an enemy assault landing. 
  Temporary fire positions are prepared and occupied for 
delivering fire to prevent reconnaissance, minesweeping, and 
mineclearing of the coastal waters by enemy ships and also to 
prevent the landing of enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups 
on the shore. Most often, one battery may be deployed from the 
artillery battalion. 
  The artillery battalion and battery command and observation 
posts and observation posts are deployed at locations that 
ensure sufficient range of surveillance of the sea and 
coastline, particularly on the likely axis of an enemy assault 
landing. It is advisable to position the posts on high ground 
and have reliable shelters. The desire to see as far as possible 
should not result in positioning command and observation posts 
and observation posts on lighthouses, churches, factory 
smokestacks, or tall buildings, since the enemy will quickly 
detect and destroy them. 
  If the terrain on the shore is mountainous, the command and 
observation posts are staggered in elevation, which ensures 
stability of observation and a view of all sectors of the land 
and sea over a long distance. Naturally, the higher the 
elevation of the observation post is above sea level the greater 
the horizontal range of visibility. This relationship is shown 
in Table 24.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The distance of the artillery battalion (battery) command 
and 
observation post from the water's edge should ensure observation 
of the enemy's actions and stability of fire control when 
fighting for the forward edge and the immediate depth of the 
maneuver battalion's defense area. The command and observation 
post should not be positioned close to the water's edge due to 
the fact that this area will be subjected to the heaviest fire, 
which can result in a rapid loss of command and control. 
  The following features must be taken into account when 
organizing and conducting reconnaissance of the enemy: speed is 
required when processing and relaying the results of observation 
when enemy ships are detected, for slowness in commencing fire 
will give the enemy the opportunity to carry out the mission and 
move out to sea with impunity. Reconnaissance subunit personnel 
and officers must be able to determine the type, class, and 
number of ships and the nature of their actions, and the 
distance to them. The lack of local features at sea that can be 
used as reference points make target designation extremely 
difficult when conducting reconnaissance and fire control of 
subunits. 
  Taking these features into account, artificial reference 
points (rafts, buoys, and barrels) are set up at sea, ensuring 
their fixed location. Their location is checked by instruments. 
  The basic reconnaissance missions when defending a seacoast 
are: timely detection of enemy ships during their movement 
toward the coast; determining the direction of movement of enemy 
assault-landing craft and landing forces and the approach of 
subsequent waves of the assault landing force. 
  Forward and lateral observation posts should be deployed 
more 
fully when organizing reconnaissance. If there are small islands 
on the near approaches from the sea, these posts should be 
positioned there. 
  The primary fire position area is usually designated based 
on 
the requirement of making maximum utilization of the firing 
range to destroy the enemy assault force on the water. However, 
this should not be to the detriment of the stability of battery 
dispositions in the event the enemy penetrates our defense. A 
situation cannot be permitted in which the batteries would be 
forced to abandon the fire positions if the enemy penetrates our 
defense slightly. 
  The artillery battalion's combat operations are organized in 
conditions of a lack of direct contact with the enemy, which 
ensures more complete resolution of coordination matters, 
detailed study of the terrain, and the most favorable 
positioning of the battle formation of subunits. 
  The sequence of the artillery battalion (battery) 
commander's 
work after receipt of the mission in each specific case will 
depend on the situation conditions and the time available. The 
work will usually be conducted in the same way as when 
organizing a defense in normal conditions. 
  However, there are a number of particular features in the 
work of commanders. 
  When estimating the situation, the artillery battalion 
(battery) commander must, first of all, study the nature of the 
seacoast, namely: the outline of the coastline, the depth of 
the coastal zone of the sea, the presence of underwater 
obstacles, the nature of flood and ebb tides, the condition of 
the seabed at the shore, and possible avenues of approach of 
enemy assault landing forces. When assessing the terrain in 
friendly troop dispositions, the commanders study and determine 
favorable and convenient spots for deploying command and 
observation posts and observation posts, fire position areas, 
the presence and condition of roads and bridges in case of a 
maneuver by the artillery battalion's subunits, the nature and 
condition of the ground, and the conditions for camouflage of 
the fire positions and command and observation posts. 
  To carefully study the nature of the coast and to update the 
missions received, the artillery battalion commander conducts 
ground reconnaissance, during which he studies, in addition to 
other things, the outline of the coastline and its changes 
during flood and ebb tides, the outline of the forward area of 
the defense, the locations of artificial obstacles in the sea 
and underwater obstacles, the condition of the seabed near 
shore, and possible avenues of approach and landing sectors of 
enemy assault landing forces. He also determines measures for 
repelling the enemy at night and in conditions of reduced 
visibility (fog, the use of smoke by the enemy, and so forth). 
  The artillery battalion usually assigns fire missions to the 
subunits in a verbal combat order according to the following 
tactical tasks: interdicting the advance and deployment of the 
assault force; repelling the landing of an assault force and the 
capture of a bridgehead; supporting defending subunits; and 
supporting a counterattack. 
  The success of repelling an assault force depends to a 
considerable extent on its timely detection. Therefore, all 
reconnaissance efforts, including the artillery battalion's 
reconnaissance, are aimed at ascertaining the approach of an 
enemy assault force in the deployment areas and also at 
determining the sectors of coastal waters that the enemy is 
preparing to clear of obstacles. 
  In order to achieve surprise, the assault force usually will 
approach the landing area at night. Under cover of darkness, the 
troops are transferred from transports to the assault-landing 
craft. Simultaneously, passages will be cleared in the 
minefields, and landing areas will be reconnoitered by 
reconnaissance groups (landing from individual ships, craft, and 
submarines). 
  If the enemy prepares an assault landing from a coast 
divided 
by a relatively narrow strait, he crosses the water obstacle on 
assault-landing craft and makes the landing from them without 
transferring. 
  The assault landing is preceded by artillery and air 
preparation, under the cover of which the enemy assault-landing 
craft will approach the shore. As the enemy reaches the 
effective range of artillery fire, the artillery battalion 
commander reports this to the senior commander (chief) and opens 
fire. Using fire prepared in advance, or according to newly 
received data, the artillery battalion uses primarily 
concentrated fire to engage the transports and assault-landing 
craft. Assault waves heading toward the shore are engaged by a 
creeping barrage. 
  The artillery battalion commander must strive to see that 
the 
battalion's fire inflicts maximum losses on the enemy on the 
water before he lands on shore. This is advantageous because 
minimal time and ammunition are expended. For example, an 
assault-landing craft carrying up to a platoon of infantry can 
be sunk by the fire from one 57- to 85- mm gun by direct fire 
with an average expenditure of 10-15 rounds in two=three 
minutes. Concentrated fire from a 122-mm howitzer battery can 
sink a barge in a comparatively short period of time from an 
indirect-fire position, destroying up to a company of tanks, up 
to a company of motorized infantry, or one to two artillery 
batteries. 
  Clearly, a considerably larger amount of artillery, and 
significantly more ammunition would be required to destroy the 
same forces and weapons after they have landed on the beach. 
  As the assault force approaches the beach, the defense's 
volume and intensity of fire increase, and more weapons enter 
into battle in succession. Batteries and ATGM subunits 
delivering direct fire destroy assault-landing craft, amphibious 
tanks, and infantry fighting vehicles. 
  When the enemy closes to within 400-500 meters, all weapons 
fire with maximum intensity. The artillery battalion puts up a 
fixed barrage on the axis of concentration of the enemy's main 
efforts. 
  Defending subunits used fire from all weapons to destroy the 
most vulnerable portion of the enemy assault force and prevent 
it from landing on the beach. 
  If the enemy manages to land on the beach, the artillery 
battalion uses its fire to destroy him, prevent him from 
spreading into the depth and toward the flanks, and also 
prevents subsequent waves from landing. 
  Taking into account the diversity of the fire missions the 
artillery battalion has to carry out, independent fire by 
batteries takes on very great importance. 
  If the enemy uses superior forces to capture part of the 
coast, he is destroyed by a second-echelon (reserve) 
counterattack. Prior to the counterattack, the artillery 
battalion uses concentrated fire or battery fire against single 
targets to neutralize enemy weapons and personnel on the axis of 
the counterattack and during the counterattack supports the 
advance of the counterattacking subunits. 
  If the counterattack by our subunits results in pinning down 
the enemy to the beach, the artillery battalion uses 
concentrated fire to engage approaching waves of the assault 
force, prepares barrage fire to consolidate the line achieved, 
and assists adjacent units when necessary. 
  If the counterattack is unsuccessful, the artillery 
battalion 
commander uses barrage fire to prevent expansion of the landing 
sector and concentrated fire to engage the forces that have 
landed. He creates favorable conditions for repeat and 
subsequent counterattacks by our forces. 
<H3>  Features of Conducting Combat Operations Under Various 
Conditions </H3>
<H5>  Night Operations </H5>
  During a night defense, the artillery battalion (battery) 
must be at constant readiness to fire to repel a surprise enemy 
attack. Therefore, as night approaches, the artillery commander 
must plan and carry out additional measures which would 
contribute to the best execution of the assigned missions. Such 
measures may be: preparing command and observation posts and 
fire positions for night operations; determining the procedures 
for using night-vision devices and radar, if one has been 
attached; updating the sequence of operations by combined-arms 
subunits in repelling an enemy attack and the order of executing 
fire missions by the artillery battalion (battery); assigning 
missions to subunits for illuminating the terrain and targets 
and engaging enemy illuminating equipment and night-vision 
devices; moving up the artillery battalion's (battery's) forward 
observation post closer to the forward edge of the defense; 
organizing a check of the operability of night-vision and 
illumination devices; reinforcing local security; informing 
personnel of the identification markings of friendly combat 
equipment; determining measures to ensure subunit safety from 
the effects of thermal radiation from a nuclear burst; 
distributing illuminating ammunition; and supplying subunits 
with illumination and signal devices. 
  To carry out the planned measures, the artillery battalion 
commander issues the necessary instructions while there is still 
light. If necessary, he assigns forces and assets and arranges 
to monitor the preparation of subunits. 
  When preparing the command and observation post for night 
operation, manmade reference points (visible at night) are set 
up; the orientation of instruments is checked; readings are 
taken on reference points; angles of site are determined for the 
most important targets and reference points and directions to 
them are staked out; instruments are prepared for night 
operations; and blacking out of light sources is checked. 
  The duty of scouts, officers, and radiotelephone operators 
with communications equipment is established at observation 
posts with the onset of darkness. 
  During preparations for night operations at battery fire 
positions, night aiming points (collimators) are set up; 
illuminating rounds and devices for illuminating approaches to 
the fire positions for self-defense are prepared; guns are aimed 
at the most critical sector of barrage fire ahead of the forward 
edge of the defense; ammunition, instruments, and sighting 
equipment are prepared for night operations; and blacking out of 
light sources is checked. Alert crews or crew members at the 
guns are assigned in each battery. 
  The artillery battalion commander usually moves up one of 
the 
batteries to the temporary fire position to carry out individual 
fire missions at night. Reconnaissance and preparation of this 
position are usually accomplished during the day. 
  Barrage fire sectors prepared on the most important axis may 
be registered, and firing data may be updated on a regular basis. 
<H5>  Operations in the Mountains </H5>
  A maneuver battalion's defense in the mountains is 
structured 
by creating company and individual platoon strongholds to hold 
dominant heights, passes, and other important terrain sectors. 
Reconnaissance and patrolling are accomplished, ambushes are set 
up, and obstacles are erected in the gaps between strongholds. 
  An artillery battalion assigned to support or attached to a 
maneuver battalion prepares fire to engage the enemy on 
approaches to the forward edge of the defense, on the flanks and 
in gaps between strongholds, in passes, in gorges and 
chokepoints, and at convenient crossings over rivers and canyons. 
  To destroy the enemy who has penetrated into the defense, 
concentrated fire and barrage fire are prepared against road 
junctions, approaches to commanding heights, places that can be 
used by the enemy to bypass the defense area, and also terrain 
sectors where the landing of an enemy helicopter assault force 
is possible. 
  The difficult mountainous terrain in many places may hinder 
the preparation and delivery of a fixed barrage by the entire 
artillery battalion. In such conditions, the role of fire, 
separately, by each battery increases considerably. 
  The artillery battalion's command and observation posts, in 
addition to observation posts, are staggered in depth and 
positioned in different tiers, ensuring reconnaissance of the 
enemy throughout the assigned zone, observation of concealed 
approaches to the forward edge of the defense, and timely 
request for fire from the artillery battalion. Much attention is 
given to the deployment of forward and lateral observation posts 
in the artillery battalion and batteries. A diagram of dead 
ground is drawn up from the location of each command and 
observation post, in addition to observation posts. 
  The possibility of a broader maneuver of fire and firing 
over 
hillcrests is taken into account when selecting fire positions. 
Fire positions may be selected in sectors of adjacent units by 
authority of the senior chief. 
  Part of the artillery battalion's guns may be assigned for 
direct fire to cover approaches to dominant heights. 
  When preparing the fire positions, gun emplacements and 
shelters are made primarily in a semisunken or banked-up manner 
using rocks, sandbags, and other material. 
  In organizing combat operations in the mountains, special 
attention is given to conducting reconnaissance on the flanks 
and detecting enveloping enemy detachments. A surprise enemy 
attack from the flank or rear of the defense area can 
considerably weaken the position of the defending subunits. A 
detected enveloping detachment is engaged by concentrated fire 
from the artillery battalion or by battery fire in coordination 
with other weapons of the maneuver battalion. 
<H5>  Operations in the Desert </H5>
  A maneuver battalion usually takes up a defense in the 
desert 
on the most likely axis of enemy operations. The gaps between 
battalion defense areas, as a rule, are greater than in normal 
conditions. 
  The battalion defense area and company strongholds are 
prepared for all-around defense. Fire lines are prepared and 
ambushes and obstacles are set up in the gaps between 
strongholds. 
  To engage the enemy, an artillery battalion prepares 
concentrated fire against areas of possible concentration of 
personnel and weapons in populated points and oases, near water 
sources, and also against routes of movement (envelopment) and 
deployment lines. It prepares barrage fire to repel an enemy 
attack in front of the forward edge of the defense and in gaps 
between strongholds. 
  Good field of view and fire conditions and the possibility 
for artillery subunits to move off-road, except for areas of 
quicksand and wet salt marshes, on the one hand, allow extensive 
maneuver of fire and subunits. On the other hand, they require 
thorough camouflage and the setting up of artificial reference 
points and hinder engineer preparation of command and 
observation posts in addition to observation posts. Batteries 
maneuver to alternate fire positions over routes reconnoitered 
in advance and marked with visible markers. 
  Constant readiness of gun platoons for all-around tank 
defense acquires utmost importance in desert conditions. 
  Frequent sand and dust storms demand that special attention 
be given to caring for armament and combat equipment. In 
organizing combat operations, the artillery battalion commander 
must provide for creating stores of ammunition, fuel, and water, 
and monitor their consumption, in addition to observing water 
discipline. Special attention is given to performing sanitation 
and hygienic measures. 
<H5>  Operations in Northern Areas </H5>
  Natural conditions, the nature of the terrain (the presence 
of hills, mountains, a large number of marshes, lakes, rivers, 
and other difficult terrain sectors), and, in addition, the deep 
snow cover in the winter have a significant effect on organizing 
defense in northern areas. A defense in northern areas is 
organized on axes accessible for an enemy attack by preparing 
individual company and platoon strongholds for all-around 
defense. 
  Artillery subunits (battalion, battery) are usually attached 
to motorized rifle subunits defending in the first echelon. An 
artillery battalion prepares fire to engage the enemy in 
concentrated areas (against populated points, sparse forests, 
and other sheltered areas), in attack positions, and on near 
approaches to the defense in the gaps between strongholds and on 
exposed flanks. 
  When organizing combat operations, the artillery battalion 
commander must take into account the features of the summer and 
winter periods of the northern area and determine the necessary 
measures for maintaining the artillery battalion subunits at a 
high degree of combat readiness. Thus, in the winter it is 
necessary to carry out such measures as more frequent updating 
of firing data; warming up guns by firing single rounds with 
reduced charges; preparing equipment and combat equipment for 
operation in conditions of low temperatures, deep snow cover, 
and bad roads; setting up warming points for personnel; 
preparing subunits to carry out fire missions during a snowfall 
(blizzard or snowstorm); clearing shelters and emplacements 
after a heavy snowfall; assigning an alert battery; and 
reinforcing local security during the polar night and during a 
lengthy blizzard (snowstorm). 
  To engage the enemy when there is a heavy snow cover, it is 
advisable to fire shells with time fuses. 
  A defense on a broad front and in difficult terrain 
conditions requires the artillery battalion commander to have 
thorough camouflage and a rational location of command and 
observation posts for the purpose of reliable command and 
control and the possibility of maneuvering fire toward the 
flanks to counter deep and close envelopments by the enemy. 
  The experience of creating mobile reconnaissance groups has 
proved itself in combat. Such groups were created in each 
artillery battalion and battery. The artillery battalion 
intelligence officer usually tasked the group to conduct 
reconnaissance or follow-up reconnaissance of targets. Its 
actions were coordinated with the commander of the rifle subunit 
on whose sector the mission was being carried out.

<H5>  Chapter Seven. The Artillery Battalion on the March </H5>
<H5>  March Fundamentals </H5>
  The highly mobile nature of modern combat will make it 
necessary to move units and subunits, which will be 
accomplished, as a rule, in difficult conditions. Massed use of 
air support, incendiary weapons, and especially nuclear weapons 
will result in the destruction of railroad junctions, stations, 
bridges, and ports (wharfs), and significantly impede 
transportation of all types. Therefore, the march may prove to 
be the primary method of movement. 
  A march is the organized movement of subunits in columns 
over 
roads and cross-country routes with the purpose of arriving at a 
designated area or line in a timely manner. 
  As a rule, an artillery battalion executes a march as part 
of 
a march column of an artillery or combined-arms unit (subunit); 
a battery does so as part of a march column of an artillery 
battalion or combined-arms subunit. In some cases, an artillery 
battalion may execute a march as an independent column over a 
separate route. 
  To achieve secrecy and reduce losses, it is advisable to 
execute a march at night or in other conditions of limited 
visibility (rain, fog, low cloud cover, or snowfall). The combat 
situation conditions also may require a march to be executed in 
the daytime. In this case, the subunits move at high speeds, the 
intervals between vehicles are increased, and column security is 
reinforced. 
  Depending on the mission and situation conditions, an 
artillery battalion may execute a march in anticipation of an 
engagement, or without the threat of encountering the enemy 
toward the front, from the front to the rear, or along the front. 
  A march in anticipation of engagement is executed, as a 
rule, 
in conditions of pressure by enemy air support or the enemy's 
use of weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, when organizing a 
march, provisions are made primarily for ensuring the artillery 
battalion's constant combat readiness for rapid deployment into 
battle formation and opening surprise and accurate fire. In the 
conditions, the artillery battalion may be attached to a 
maneuver battalion assigned to an advance guard (forward 
detachment) or be directly subordinate to the regiment 
commander. Above all, self-propelled artillery subunits are 
attached to the advance guard or forward detachment. The 
maneuver battalion commander determines the place of an 
artillery battalion attached to a maneuver battalion. Usually, 
the artillery battalion moves at the tail of its column; the 
artillery battalion commander, having communications equipment, 
proceeds with the maneuver battalion commander. 
  A battery in anticipation of engagement executes a march as 
part of an advance (flank, rear) party, in the advance guard, or 
as part of the artillery battalion column. 
  The place of an artillery battalion executing a march as 
part 
of its own unit is determined by decision of the unit commander. 
In doing so, the artillery battalion commander proceeds at the 
head of the artillery battalion column; the battery commanders 
proceed at the head of their columns. The chief of staff usually 
proceeds at the head of the artillery battalion column. 
  When executing a march as an independent column, a patrol 
squad is sent out for local security to the distance of visual 
contact. The patrol squad is provided communications equipment 
and is sent out ahead and, if necessary, to the rear and flanks 
of the column. 
  As a rule, an artillery battalion usually executes a march 
in 
its own unit column when there is no threat of encountering the 
enemy. 
  The senior commander usually establishes the length of the 
day's march and the average speed of movement. This depends on 
the mission assigned, the training of the drivers, the type of 
transports, the technical condition of these vehicles and 
artillery equipment, and also on road conditions, the season of 
the year, the time of day, and the weather. An average speed of 
up to 20 km/hour at night and 25-30 km/hour in the daytime is 
possible for a mixed column (tracked and wheeled vehicles) when 
executing a march in conditions of flat or semibroken terrain. 
The average speed may be the same for the entire march. It will 
be higher than average when traveling over highways and improved 
roads and lower when traveling over dirt roads, field (forest) 
roads, bridges, fords, and when crossing areas of massive 
destruction and obstructions. 
  The speed will be lower when executing a march in the 
mountains, during the season of bad roads, during heavy 
snowfall, fog, and rain, and also over dusty roads during dry 
weather. Experience shows that the speed is 10-15 km/hour for 
motor vehicles and up to 10 km/hour for tracked prime movers 
when executing a march in the mountains and in areas with 
ascents and descents of 10 degrees or more. 
  The cross-country capability of motor vehicles and primary 
artillery movers is increased by providing them with off-road 
equipment, using prepared mats and brushwood, and using 
engineering equipment to lay paths over deep snow. 
  In all cases, the march must be executed at the maximum 
speed 
possible in the given conditions. 
  An artillery battalion usually executes a march in one 
column. The intervals between subunits in the artillery 
battalion column and also between prime movers and vehicles 
depend on the speed of movement and visibility conditions and 
can range from 25 to 50 meters. The higher the speed, the 
greater the interval. The intervals increase when traveling on 
sharp ascents and descents over dusty roads and ice; they 
decrease when traveling at night. 
  When organizing a march, the artillery battalion is given a 
starting point, control points, and the time for crossing them 
to ensure the march starts on time and to regulate the speed of 
movement. Halts and day (night) rest halts are designated to 
inspect the vehicles and guns, perform maintenance on them, and 
to feed and rest personnel. 
  Prime movers and vehicles of the batteries are positioned in 
a herringbone pattern when possible (Figure 30) in the 
disposition area and in the day (night) rest halt area to ensure 
that the column forms up quickly and starts in a timely manner. 




<H5>    March Organization </H5>
  An artillery battalion's march is organized by the artillery 
battalion commander based on the operation order or operational 
instruction received from the senior commander (chief). 
  The commander of an artillery battalion attached to a 
maneuver battalion must report to the maneuver battalion 
commander at the designated time, report on the status and 
capabilities of the artillery battalion, and receive the mission 
from him. The sequence of the artillery battalion's work in 
organizing the march is shown in Figure 31. 




    When clarifying the mission and assessing the situation, the 
artillery battalion commander must firmly understand where and 
by what time the artillery battalion is to arrive, the length of 
the march, how much time is allocated for the march and under 
what conditions it is being executed, the artillery battalion's 
place in the march column, and the missions at the line of 
possible deployment when entering into battle or on arrival in 
the new area. In addition, the artillery battalion commander 
studies the route (from a map or aerial photography, taking into 
account data from reconnaissance of the route, if it was 
conducted) and lines of possible deployment. He plans the fire 
position areas and command and observation post locations on 
these lines. A work map is prepared for command and control of 
the artillery battalion. 
  The artillery battalion commander then plans measures for 
preparing the artillery battalion for the march: dispatching an 
artillery reconnaissance group; preparing personnel, prime 
movers, motor vehicles, equipment, and instruments; replenishing 
supplies; and other measures. He also issues appropriate 
directions and instructions. 
  When executing a march in the column of an artillery or 
combined-arms unit, reconnaissance of the route and traffic 
control service on the route are organized by forces and assets 
of the senior commander. 
  In an artillery battalion executing a march in the column of 
the advance guard, artillery reconnaissance subunits move 
forward with the advance party under the direction of the 
artillery battalion intelligence officer; the artillery 
reconnaissance group follows the advance party. 
  When organizing a march in anticipation of engagement, the 
artillery battalion commander determines the following in his 
decision: the distribution of batteries to reinforce 
combined-arms subunits; the alignment of the artillery battalion 
column; the order of deployment and battery missions when 
engaging; and organization of command and control on the march 
and when engaging. 
  When the artillery battalion executes a march as an 
independent column over a separate route, the artillery 
battalion commander will usually be assigned an assembly area 
and an arrival time. The artillery battalion staff makes a march 
timetable and plots the artillery battalion's position, route, 
and assembly area on the map. It plans the starting point and 
control points; determines the length of the route by measuring 
the distance from the starting point to the far boundary of the 
assembly area increasing the distance by 5-15 percent, taking 
into account the nature of the terrain on the route (ascents, 
descents, bends in roads) and the scale of the map. The staff 
then breaks the route into 10-km segments, plans halts and their 
duration, determines the alignment of the march column, and 
calculates the length of the column by multiplying the total 
number of motor vehicles and artillery primary movers with guns 
by the established interval between them (the length of the gun 
plus primary mover is included in the interval). It determines 
the speed of the the artillery battalion column at various 
sectors of the route and calculates the time for crossing the 
starting point and control points, calculates the time for the 
column to form up at the starting point and for the column to 
form up at the assembly area, with the speed being one-half to 
three-fourths the average speed on the route, and then 
determines the time for the march, unless indicated by the 
senior commander. 
  Prior to executing the march, the artillery battalion 
commander issues an operation order in which he indicates the 
following. 
  In the first paragraph--information about the enemy. 
  In the second paragraph--the mission of the combined-arms 
subunit (unit). 
  In the third paragraph--the mission of adjacent units. 
  In the fourth paragraph--the mission of the artillery 
battalion (battery), the route of movement, the place in the 
march formation of the combined-arms (artillery) units or 
subunits, the assembly area (rest area) or fire position area 
(deployment line), the time of arrival there and what actions to 
be ready for, the starting point, control points and time for 
crossing them, the place and time of halts, column alignment, 
speed of movement, intervals between vehicles, and procedures 
for using the navigation equipment of command vehicles. 
  In the fifth paragraph--after the words "I order," the 
artillery battalion commander assigns the missions: 
  --for artillery reconnaissance subunits: composition, 
mission, destination, time of passing the starting point, 
procedures for maintaining contact, and procedures for using the 
navigation equipment of the mobile reconnaissance station. 
  --for the artillery reconnaissance group: composition and 
its 
chief, missions, destination, time and place for joining the 
advance party or advance guard column. 
  --for a battery assigned to the advance party: the mission 
and time and place for joining the advance party column. 
  --for batteries proceeding in the artillery battalion 
column: 
the mission, place in the column, and order of deployment on 
lines of possible encounter with the enemy. 
  In the sixth paragraph--locations and procedures for 
refueling vehicles during the march and, in addition, ammunition 
expenditure in anticipation of engagement. 
  In the seventh paragraph--time of readiness for the march. 
  In the eighth paragraph--observation and communications 
procedures during the march and the location of the artillery 
battalion (battery) commander, staff, and deputies in the column. 
  A necessary element in the artillery battalion commander's 
work in preparing for the march is assisting subunits and 
checking their readiness. 
  Subunit commanders, drivers, and mechanics inspect the 
artillery primary movers and motor vehicles prior to the march. 
They check levels of fuel, lubricants, water (antifreeze); the 
serviceability of control, illumination, and signaling 
mechanisms; the presence and attachment of off-road equipment 
and firefighting equipment. They also check the serviceability 
of the running gear and brake systems of the guns, and the 
proficiency of preparing guns and ammunition for firing. 
  In the subunits, they also check the availability and 
serviceability of individual protective gear; the presence of 
canvas covers, stores of water, emergency food rations, and 
small-arms ammunition on the motor vehicles (prime movers); the 
serviceability of communications equipment and instruments and 
their stowage in the vehicles. They ensure that observers are 
supplied with chemical and radiation reconnaissance instruments, 
and that radio operators are provided radio operating data. They 
also check personnel knowledge of warning signals, and make sure 
that officers have work maps and keep them up to date. 
  The check of subunit readiness should be more thorough prior 
to a night march. The artillery battalion's mechanic inspects in 
detail the serviceability of engine instruments. The drivers 
clean dust from the headlights, clearance lights, brake lights, 
and convoy lights. Light bulbs that have burned out are replaced 
in the illumination and signaling devices. 
  The technical maintenance echelon may consist of a motor 
vehicle and tractor maintenance and service shop and one or two 
spare prime movers. 
  Let us use a tactical example to follow the work of the 
artillery battalion commander and staff in organizing a march. 
<H6>  Tactical Example 4 </H6>
<H5>  Initial Tactical Situation (Map, Figure 32) </H5>
  An artillery battalion of 122-mm self-propelled howitzers, 
having executed a 300-km march as part of the 17th Motorized 
Rifle Regiment, was located in the area of Konty, Hill 127.0, 
Vertichi by 0800 hours 5 May. The combat equipment and motor 
vehicles were concealed, and local security, self-defense, and 
chemical and radiation reconnaissance had been organized. 
  The artillery battalion commander learned from information 
from the regiment chief of staff that our troops were waging 
defensive battles 120-130 km to the west. 




    During the day of 5 May, slit trenches for shelter were dug, 
camouflage work was performed, the condition of the combat 
equipment and motor vehicles was checked, detected malfunctions 
were corrected, and refueling was accomplished. The personnel 
had a six-hour rest. 
  At 1830 hours on 5 May, the artillery commander was summoned 
to the 17th MRR headquarters, where together with the commanders 
of the 1st MRB and the tank battalion he received the mission: 
  "1. Having gone over to the attack with superior forces, the 
enemy has penetrated our defenses and is threatening to break 
through them. His forward subunits have reached the line along 
Yuryevo, Tolmachi, Mokhovo, which is 15-20 km west of Orekhovo. 
Enemy air support is conducting reconnaissance of our positions 
and making strikes against them and rear installations. The 
enemy has landed a tactical airborne assault force 10-12 km 
south of Orekhovo. 
  "2. Our troops are waging defensive battles with the enemy 
and have halted his advance with counterattacks in a number of 
sectors. Air support is making bomb and missile strikes against 
the enemy, and in coordination with air defense assets is 
covering our troops against enemy airstrikes. 
  "3. The 17th MRR, making up the reserve of the higher 
commander, has been given the mission to execute a march over 
the route along Bykovo, Detki, Bekovo, Orekhovo and by 0700 
hours on 6 May to occupy the line along Peschanaya, Orekhovo, 
Liski and prevent an enemy breakthrough in the direction of 
Tolmachi, Bekovo. 
  "4. The regiment's advance guard is the 1st MRB with a tank 
company, the 1st Arty Bn, an antiaircraft artillery battery, and 
a combat engineer platoon. It is to execute a march over the 
regiment's route with the mission of ensuring unimpeded movement 
of the regiment and by 0600 hours 6 on May occupy the area of 
Hill 137.2, Orekhovo, the western edge of the grove and organize 
a fire plan and support deployment of the regiment's main body. 
  "The head of the column is to pass the starting point--the 
bridge across Bystryy Brook--at 2230 hours on 5 May. It is to 
pass phase line No. 1--the western outskirts of Detki--at 0240 
hours 6 May. There is to be a one-hour halt, 0130-0230 hours, on 
6 May." 
  The commander of the 1st MRB informed the artillery 
battalion 
commander that with the limited time for organizing the march, 
he would hear his report in 30 minutes at the regimental 
headquarters, after which he would announce his decision. The 
artillery battalion commander issued instructions by telephone, 
summoning the commanders to the artillery battalion headquarters 
by 1940 hours, made a timetable for preparing for the march 
(Table 25), and began assessing the situation.

<H5>  Situation Assessment </H5>
  The enemy is conducting offensive operations and is located 
15 km from the line to be occupied by the advance guard. There 
are 11 hours until the advance guard is to reach this line, with 
three hours of daylight. In this time the enemy, advancing at a 
speed of 1.5-2 km/hour, can advance to a depth of 17-22 km and 
capture this line. 
  Our units are waging stubborn battles, trying to prevent the 
enemy from advancing into the rear. The enemy's superiority in 
forces and assets should be taken into account. 
  Therefore, the following is possible when the advance guard 
reaches the area it is to defend: 
  --occupy this area under difficult conditions of pressure 
from enemy weapons and airstrikes. 
  --an encounter with the enemy in an engagement, which is 
possible at a line 5-7 km east of Orekhovo. 
  For the artillery battalion to be ready for an encounter 
with 
the enemy, it is necessary: 
  --to issue instructions on the sequence of actions by 
personnel during an enemy air raid and for organizing local 
security on the march. 
  --to check the readiness of individual protective gear in 
case the enemy uses weapons of mass destruction; plan 
concentrated fire and barrage fire to engage the enemy when the 
advance guard is defending the assigned line. 
  The artillery battalion is battleworthy. The technical 
condition of the combat equipment and motor vehicles and the 
availability of supplies make it possible to execute the march 
successfully, deploy for battle from the line of march, and 
carry out the assigned missions. 
  The terrain on the route is semibroken with groves and 
forest, which helps to conceal movement. 
  The route should be divided into two parts according to the 
condition of the road cover: 77 km is hard-surface road, which 
supports movement at a speed of 25 km/hour; 43 km is dirt road, 
making it possible to travel at a speed of 15 km/hour. 
  The road network is developed, which is conducive to quickly 
finding routes for bypassing zones of probable contamination, 
areas of destruction, and pockets of fire. Populated points 
having brick structures may be used as strongholds both by the 
enemy and our troops. 
  Bridges on the route enable all types of combat equipment to 
move. 
  The terrain is accessible for tanks on the line of probable 
encounter and in the area designated for defense. It is 
advisable to select fire positions in the areas... (he indicates 
them on the map). Command and observation posts are to be with 
the battalion commander and company posts. 
  The wooded area which the column will cross is a fire 
hazard. 
In addition, it is favorable for operations by enemy sabotage 
and reconnaissance groups. When approaching this area, it is 
necessary to increase observation and column security and bring 
personnel to the ready for actions. 
  Heavy rains are possible. 
  The march is being executed during hours of darkness, which 
ensures concealed movement and reduces the possibility of enemy 
airstrikes. Direct the attention of drivers and all personnel to 
night march discipline--the intervals between vehicles are 
reduced. 
  The advance guard is to reach the line of probable encounter 
with the enemy or the area for taking up the defense at dawn. 
This is advantageous for orientation, battlefield surveillance, 
rapid deployment, and more effective use of all weapons to 
inflict maximum losses on the enemy. 
  Here is the artillery battalion commander's report to the 
1st 
MRB commander. 
  "Comrade Major! The artillery battalion has seventeen 122-mm 
self-propelled howitzers in its inventory. It is located in the 
area of Konty, Hill 127.0, Vertichi (4 km from regimental 
headquarters). It is battle worthy. Ammunition supplies are 1.25 
units of fire; fuel supplies are available for one refueling. 
  "With the available guns and ammunition, the artillery 
battalion is able to do the following: 
  "--when defending the occupied area: when the enemy 
approaches, it can use concentrated fire to neutralize two to 
three targets (expenditure of 0.2-0.3 units of fire); when 
repelling an enemy attack, it can prepare a creeping barrage on 
two or three lines and a fixed barrage on one or two lines 
(expenditure of 0.3-0.5 units of fire) and engage 10-12 single 
targets (expenditure of 0.4 units of fire). The artillery 
battalion is preparing fire... (he indicates on the map). 
  "--in an engagement: it can use concentrated fire to 
neutralize two or three sectors of the enemy deploying for 
battle (expenditure of 0.2-0.3 units of fire); when repelling an 
enemy attack and covering the flanks, it can prepare a fixed 
barrage on two or three lines (expenditure of 0.2-0.3 units of 
fire) and engage 12-16 single targets (expenditure of 0.5-0.7 
units of fire). 
  "I propose allocating the batteries as follows for 
supporting 
the companies: 1st Btry--1st MRC, 3d Btry--2d or 3d MRC, and 
have the 2d Btry as standby. 
  "Assign the mortar battery to support one of the companies 
when the maneuver battalion is operating in one echelon. On the 
march, the battery commanders are to proceed with the commanders 
of the supported companies; the commander of the standby battery 
and I will proceed with you." 
<H5>  Decision of the Advance Guard Commander </H5>
  The advance guard is to be aligned as follows for executing 
the march: advance party, main body (headquarters, combat 
engineer platoon, ATGM platoon, tank company, minus a tank 
platoon, antiaircraft artillery battery, 2d MRC, 3d MRC, mortar 
battery, artillery battalion, minus 1st Btry), logistical 
subunits, technical maintenance echelon, and a scout car from 
the 3d MRC. 
  Speed of movement: from the starting point to Detki (77 
km)--25 km/hour; from Detki to Orekhovo (43 km)--15 km/hour. 
Intervals between vehicles and subunits--25 meters. 
  Strikes by enemy aircraft and helicopters are to be repelled 
by all antiaircraft weapons. 
  March security of the advance party--1st MRC with a tank 
platoon, a combat engineer squad, and 1st Btry--executes the 
march over the route of the advance guard. Its mission is to 
prevent the enemy from penetrating to the main body. It is to 
travel at a distance of five km from the head of the main body 
and pass the starting point at 2215 hours 5 May. 
  If the advance party encounters small enemy subunits, it is 
to destroy them on the move. If it encounters superior enemy 
forces in the vicinity of Orekhovo, it is to take up an 
advantageous line and use stationary fire to support the 
deployment of the maneuver battalion's main body from its left 
flank. 
  When occupying the assigned defense area, the maneuver 
battalion battle formation is in one echelon: the 2d MRC on the 
right, the 1st MRC in the center, and the 3d MRC (minus a 
motorized rifle platoon) on the left; the reserve is the 3d 
Motorized Rifle Platoon of the 3d MRC. 
  I approve the planned fire missions. 
  The artillery battalion is to proceed as part of the advance 
guard column and pass the starting point at 2240 hours. 
  On the march, I am at the head of the main body's column; if 
the enemy is encountered, I leave for the advance party. 
Communications during movement is by radio using short 
prearranged signals; during an engagement, communications are by 
radio, unrestricted using the coded map. 
  Control signals: "Aldan" 222--crossing starting point; 
"Irtysh" 555--passing control point No. 1; "Sherenga" 
800--deploy into battle formation; "Shkval"--request for fire. 
  At 1945 hours, the artillery battalion commander returned to 
the artillery battalion headquarters, issued instructions for 
march preparation, and worked on the work map with the chief of 
staff (Figure 32). 
  The subunit commanders arrived at 2100 hours. The artillery 
battalion commander issues the operation order for the march. 
  "1. The enemy, located 120-130 km from us to the west, has 
gone over to the attack with superior forces and penetrated the 
defenses of our units. His forward subunits have reached the 
line along Yuryevo, Tolmachi, Mokhovo, which is 15-20 km west of 
Orekhovo (indicates it on the map). Enemy air support is 
conducting reconnaissance of our troop dispositions and making 
bombing strikes against them and on rear installations. The 
enemy has landed a tactical airborne assault force 10-12 km 
south of Orekhovo. 
  "2. Our troops are waging defensive battles and have halted 
the enemy advance by counterattacks on a number of sectors. 
  "The 17th MRR has been tasked to execute a march over the 
route Bykovo, Detki, Bekovo, Orekhovo and, by 0700 hours 6 May, 
occupy the line along Peschanaya, Orekhovo, Liski and prevent 
the enemy from breaking through in the direction of Tolmachi, 
Bekovo. 
  "The 1st MRB with a tank company, the 1st Arty Bn, an 
antiaircraft artillery battery, and a combat engineer 
platoon--the regiment's advance guard--is executing a march over 
the regiment's route with the mission of ensuring its unimpeded 
movement and, by 0600 hours 6 May, is to occupy the area of Hill 
137.2, Orekhovo, the western edge of the grove, organize a fire 
plan, and support deployment of the regiment's main body. 
  "3. There are no adjacent units on the right or left. 
  "4. The artillery battalion is executing a march in the 
advance guard's column over the 17th MRR's route behind the 
mortar battery. Its mission is to arrive at the area assigned to 
the advance guard for defense by 0600 hours 6 May, deploy into 
battle formation, and support subunit operations to hold this 
area. The fire position area is... (he indicates on map), and 
the command and observation posts are to be together with the 
commanders of the supported subunits. Be ready to deliver 
concentrated fire against targets 31 and 32, creeping barrage 
`Rys-1 and -2,' and fixed barrage `Grusha' and `Iva.' 
  "A meeting engagement should be expected if the enemy is 
encountered when approaching Orekhovo. 
  "The artillery battalion is to pass the starting point--the 
bridge across Bystryy Brook--with the head of the column at 2230 
hours 5 May and control point No. 1--the western outskirts of 
Detki--at 0240 hours 6 May. There is one halt, from 0130 to 0230 
hours 6 May. 
  "Alignment of the artillery battalion column is: 
headquarters, 1st Btry, 2d Btry, 3d Btry, supply section, and 
motor vehicle and tractor maintenance and service shop. 
  "The navigation equipment on the command vehicles is to be 
turned on at the halt. 
  "5. I order: 
  "--artillery reconnaissance subunits--reconnaissance squads 
of the artillery battalion and 2d Btry under the guidance of the 
intelligence officer are to proceed in the advance party column 
behind the 1st Btry commander's vehicle with the mission of 
conducting reconnaissance of the route. If the enemy is 
encountered on the approach to Orekhovo, ascertain its forces, 
assets, and intentions, and determine the coordinates of 
reconnoitered weapons. When the advance guard occupies the 
defense area, select locations for the command and observation 
posts, determine on the terrain the location of concentrated 
fire, creeping barrage, and fixed barrage fires being prepared, 
and organize reconnaissance in the subunits. Pass the starting 
point at 2215 hours. Communicate by radio using established 
signals. 
  "--1st Btry, assigned as part of the advance party, is to 
move at the tail of the column; the battery commander and the 
headquarters platoon are to move with the advance party 
commander. Upon encountering the enemy and during deployment, 
the missions are to use fire to destroy enemy personnel and 
weapons; when the maneuver battalion is occupying the defense 
area, carry out fire missions as part of the artillery battalion 
and independently, and continue to support the 1st MRC. 
  "--during deployment of the main body of the advance guard, 
the 2d and 3d Batteries are to be ready to neutralize enemy 
personnel and weapons; while occupying the defense area, carry 
out fire missions as part of the artillery battalion and 
independently. The 2d Btry is the standby battery; and the 3d 
Btry is to support the 2d MRC on the march and proceed with the 
company commander. 
  "6. Ammunition expenditure in the event of an engagement or 
when defending the assigned area is 1.0 unit of fire, and the 
rest is for a fixed barrage. 
  "7. The 1st Btry is to leave for the starting point at 2200 
hours and join the advance party column at 2215 hours; form the 
artillery battalion column at 2220 hours; the head of the column 
is at the artillery battalion headquarters. 
  "8. Each subunit is to assign observers for the ground 
enemy, 
the air, and signals. 
  "Communicate only by signals over the radio on the march. 
  "The commander of the 2d Btry and I will proceed with the 
commander of the advance guard at the head of the artillery 
battalion column. 
  "The deputy is the chief of staff and 1st Btry commander. 
  "Control signals are: `Aldan' 222 crossing starting point; 
`Irtysh' 555--passing control point No. 1; `Sherenga' 
800--deploy into battle formation; `Shkval'--request for fire, 
indicating the target number; and warning signals are as 
previously established." 
  Next the artillery battalion commander gave instructions for 
comprehensive support of the combat operations. 
<H5>  March Execution </H5>
  The artillery battalion commander forms up the column and 
moves it from the occupied area so as to occupy his place in the 
march column of the combined-arms (artillery) unit in a timely 
manner and pass the starting point at the designated time. 
Experience in exercises shows that the average time required for 
moving from the position and out into march column is up to 10 
minutes for a battery and up to 20 minutes for an artillery 
battalion. 
  The established order must be observed when executing a 
march. Guns and primary movers (motor vehicles) in the column 
must travel only on the right side of the road. The left side is 
left free for passing or for oncoming traffic. The established 
speed and intervals are constantly observed during the march. 
Vehicles or subunits leave the column and pass vehicles moving 
ahead of them only with authorization of the senior commander. 
  If a driver is forced to stop, he turns on his right turn 
signal and moves off the road or stops on the shoulder without 
blocking those behind him. The malfunction is corrected by the 
driver or, if necessary, by the workshop of the technical 
maintenance echelon. After correcting the trouble, the driver 
continues on without passing those ahead in the column. Vehicles 
that have lagged behind take up their position in the column 
only at the halt. 
  The artillery battalion commander controls the subunits on 
the march with the aid of mobile and signal equipment. When 
executing a march in anticipation of engagement, each battery 
designates radios to operate in the receive mode only. 
  Contact is maintained by radio with the artillery 
reconnaissance group commander and intelligence officer. 
  On the march, the artillery battalion commander, chief of 
staff, battery commanders, and platoon commanders personally 
track the movement route and compare it with the map, keep track 
of signals from march security, monitor subunit actions, and 
control the subunits. Orientation on the route, particularly at 
night, is facilitated by advance measurement and recording on 
the map the distances between prominent landmarks: road 
intersections, populated points, rivers, grade crossings, 
bridges, individual structures, and so forth. The recorded 
distances are compared with speedometer readings during the 
march. The topographic survey navigation equipment is turned on 
by decision of the artillery battalion commander in difficult 
march conditions. 
  The artillery battalion passes chokepoints (defiles), 
bridges, crossings, and populated points without stopping. This 
reduces the possibility of the column being hit by airstrikes 
and nuclear weapons. 
  Warnings about the approach of enemy aircraft during the 
march are received from the senior commander (chief) and from 
observers in the columns. Depending on the terrain conditions, 
subunits act by decision of the artillery battalion commander 
during an air raid. If there is good cover and camouflage, the 
column may stop or continue moving at an increased speed and 
with greater intervals between vehicles; personnel prepare to 
fire on low-flying targets. 
  If the enemy uses incendiary weapons, the subunit columns 
withdraw from the area of fire on decision of the artillery 
battalion commander and immediately begin extinguishing burning 
vehicles and assisting personnel, after which the columns 
continue movement. 
  When there is a warning about the enemy's use of chemical 
weapons against the artillery battalion column, personnel 
located in the vehicle bodies don gas masks and protective 
capes, and personnel in the cabs and covered vehicles don only 
gas masks. The column exits the zone of contamination and on 
command of the artillery battalion commander stops to perform 
partial decontamination of the equipment, if necessary, and also 
gear, uniforms, and footwear. 
  If the enemy uses nuclear weapons, the degree of damage and 
actions to eliminate the after-effects will vary in each 
specific case. The artillery battalion commander and staff 
assess the situation in a minimum amount of time and organize 
rescue work and restoration of combat effectiveness. First, 
those subunits that have the fewest losses are identified. They 
are used to assist other subunits. After restoring command and 
control, the artillery battalion commander withdraws the 
subunits from the casualty area and organizes partial 
decontamination of weapons, equipment, gear, and uniforms, 
medical aid to personnel, and partial radioactive 
decontamination and evacuation of casualties to the nearest 
medical aid stations. 
  On the march the artillery battalion must be constantly 
ready 
to repel an attack by enemy sabotage and reconnaissance groups. 
Attacks by them are most likely when passing difficult sectors 
of the route. 
  At areas of halts, the column stops on the right shoulder of 
the road with intervals between vehicles as established by the 
commander, but not less than 10 meters. All personnel, except 
for the observers and radiotelephone operations of alert 
communications equipment, dismount from the vehicles and 
position themselves to the right of the road. Drivers and 
mechanics inspect the vehicles, and gun commanders inspect the 
guns. Subunit commanders are briefed by the drivers and gun 
commanders on the condition of the weapons and vehicles, 
organize political work, brief all personnel on the latest 
information about the enemy, and update the assigned mission. 
  Maintaining constant readiness for immediate deployment is 
one of the primary tasks of artillery subunit commanders for 
ensuring successful actions during a surprise encounter with the 
enemy. 
  The Great Patriotic War has provided numerous examples of 
skilled actions by artillerymen during a march when encountering 
with the enemy. 
  Proper organization of march security and reconnaissance, 
preciseness, speed, and decisiveness made it possible to inflict 
maximum losses on the enemy. 
  Here is one example.[.sup]1[/] 
  In the spring of 1943, our troops temporarily went over 
to the defense west of Lisichansk. A partial regrouping of 
forces was made to the right flank of one of the armies in order 
to prevent a possible enemy counterstrike in the direction of 
Lisichansk. Among other units, a two-battery artillery battalion 
participated in this regrouping. On the morning of 4 March, it 
moved as a column together with the supported rifle regiment 
from Aleksandrovka to Lisichansk via Zheltoye and 
Lopasekino. 
  Since there was limited time for the march, the 
artillery battalion had to execute the march not only at night 
but also during the day. On the march, the artillery battalion 
lagged behind the rifle regiment, which went on ahead in motor 
vehicles, and lost contact with it. At 1000 hours, 
reconnaissance ascertained that the enemy was trying to capture 
Lopasekino, located on the artillery battalion's route of 
movement. It was soon learned that more than a battalion of 
enemy infantry, supported by an artillery battery and mortar 
battery, had captured Lopasekino in order to block the movement 
of our troops over the road along the left bank of the Severnyy 
Donets River. 
  After receiving this information, the artillery 
battalion commander, Senior Lieutenant Shosshes, ordered the 
battalion to deploy from the column into battle formation at 
open fire positions for direct fire against the enemy infantry 
at Lopasekino and the batteries on the west bank of the Severnyy 
Donets River. 
  The 7th Btry (commanded by Senior Lieutenant Odintsov) 
deployed and quickly opened accurate fire, inflicting heavy 
losses on the enemy. The 8th Btry (commanded by Senior 
Lieutenant Rusanov) opened fire on the enemy mortar battery and 
neutralized it. 
  The enemy artillery battery was not able to open fire 
until 30 minutes after the battle had begun. But its guns were 
soon neutralized, and the infantry ended up without support. 
  Suffering heavy losses and unable to withstand the 
withering fire of our batteries, the enemy infantry began to 
withdraw toward the river in disorder. But after receiving 
reinforcements moved there on six motor vehicles, the enemy 
halted the withdrawal and even attacked our batteries' 
positions. 
<H5>  Features of a March in Various Conditions </H5>
  A march in the mountains is organized taking into 
account the route profile. Speed of movement on ascents, 
descents, and in other difficult sectors may decrease, and the 
intervals between vehicles may increase to limits ensuring 
traffic safety. 
  When preparing for a march, special attention is given to 
careful inspection of the running gear, brakes, and control 
mechanisms. Motor vehicles and primary movers with enhanced 
off-road capability and equipped with winches are distributed 
evenly throughout the column. Each vehicle is supplies with 
cables (tow lines) and also chocks for braking in the event of a 
forced stop on an ascent or descent. It should be taken into 
account that engine power drops as the elevation above sea level 
increases. 
  A team with a primary mover may be posted on sectors with 
sharp ascents and descents to assist motor vehicles and primary 
movers with guns. 
  As a rule, subunits negotiate passes, gorges, mountain 
passages, and canyons without stopping and at the maximum 
possible speed. In the event individual vehicles are forced to 
stop due to a technical malfunction, they are moved to where 
they will not impede movement of the column. Personnel dismount 
when crossing dangerous road sectors. 
  Stopping the column below or above precipices or on sharp 
ascents or descents should be avoided. 
  Halts are designated at convenient spots for stopping the 
column, usually on level sectors of the road. Places for halts 
must not be designated on dry riverbeds or on steep slopes. It 
is desirable to designate long halts in front of long ascents 
and near sources of water. In this case, subunits are 
positioned along the roads or in sheltered places near them. 
  A march in the desert requires thorough 
preparation of equipment for travel in conditions of high 
temperatures, lack of roads, sandy terrain, and lack of water. 
  In organizing the march, the artillery battalion commander 
must study the route, determine methods for marking it on the 
terrain, determine procedures for using navigation equipment, 
provide subunits with the necessary supplies of water and fuel, 
and provide for measures to protect personnel against heatstroke. 
  It is necessary to have a store of poles, brushwood mats, or 
flexible metal netting to increase the off-road capability of 
motor vehicles and primary movers. When executing a march during 
the rainy season, terrain sectors with quicksand and salt 
marshes should be bypassed. Rubbing parts must be inspected, 
cleaned, and lubricated more often in the desert, and 
lubricating oils must be changed more frequently. To preclude 
heatstrokes and sunstrokes in personnel, halts should not be 
made in closed areas with hot, stagnant air. During the hot part 
of the day, water discipline must be strictly observed in the 
subunits. Locations of halts and rests should be selected near 
sources of water. 
  Movement may be halted when executing a march during 
sandstorms, which make orientation difficult. Vehicles stop at 
reduced intervals. It is forbidden to leave single vehicles 
alone along the route. 
  A march in the winter is characterized by a 
significant drop in the average speed, increased fuel 
consumption, and increased engine wear. Snowdrifts and low air 
temperatures require a well-conceived organization of the march, 
thorough preparation of equipment and armament, and training of 
the drivers. It is advisable to have prime movers with mounted 
equipment at the head of the column to increase off-road 
capability. 
  In a blizzard or snowstorm, when visibility drops sharply, 
the lead vehicles of each subunit travel with their headlights 
on, and the drivers of the vehicles behind them orient 
themselves on the clearance lights of those ahead. 
  In northern regions, movement may be halted in a 
heavy snowstorm by decision of the commander of the 
combined-arms unit (subunit) or the senior artillery commander. 
In these conditions, subunit commanders must set up warming 
stations for personnel, post perimeter security, and prohibit 
lone movement by personnel and vehicles. 
  An artillery battalion's march off the road may occur when 
executing an enveloping maneuver in the combined-arms unit 
(battalion) column in order to move to the enemy's rear area and 
cut off his withdrawal route. Experience of the Great 
Patriotic War showed the great difficult of off-road movement in 
the Arctic region, in Karelia, in the mountainous areas of the 
Caucasus and Carpathians in the winter, and also over the 
roadless terrain of the Far East. 
  The abundance of steep upgrades and downgrades, swampy 
terrain sectors, lakes and rivers, and undergrowth of small 
forests required our troops to be thoroughly prepared, have 
great courage, and tireless determination in achieving the 
missions of the march. 
  Preparing for a march in the winter and in the northern 
regions requires particularly thorough study, reconnaissance, 
and assessment of the possibility of travel over the planned 
route. 
  Taking into account the specific conditions, commanders at 
all levels and all personnel must demonstrate broad, intelligent 
initiative for overcoming the difficulties that arise on a march 
in the winter and during the season of bad roads. Here is one 
example from the experience of the Great Patriotic 
War.[.sup]2[/] 
  On 6 November 1944, our troops, advancing from the area 
of Kandalaksha, broke through the Nazi defenses on the northern 
slopes of hills covering the Alakurti-Kuoloyarvi rail sector 
(beyond the Arctic Circle), over which the enemy was withdrawing 
his troops into northern Finland. During their retreat, the 
Nazis blew up bridges and crossings, mined defiles, concentrated 
the fire of their artillery against our forward subunits, and 
made airstrikes against them. All this impeded the advance by 
our troops and slowed down the rate of advance. 
  An artillery battalion consisting of two gun batteries 
and one howitzer battery was supporting a pursuit detachment of 
one of the rifle regiments advancing on this axis. Due to the 
heavy enemy resistance in the area west of Alakurti Station, the 
pursuit detachment and the artillery battalion were given the 
mission to execute a flanking maneuver along the northern bank 
of the Tenni-Ioki River, come out into the enemy's rear in the 
vicinity of Kotala, and cut off his withdrawal route to the 
west. 
  The artillery battalion had to execute the 100-km march 
maneuver in five days in roadless conditions in the Arctic 
tundra in the winter. About six hours were allotted to the 
battalion to prepare for the march. However, it successfully 
prepared for the upcoming march, since its personnel were well 
trained and experienced in combat operations in the Arctic. 
  After receiving the mission, the artillery battalion 
commander briefed all officers, thoroughly studied the route of 
movement on the map, determined the location and order of 
movement of the subunits as part of the pursuit detachment, and 
established communications with the detachment commander. 
  On 13 November, the artillery battalion departed on the 
planned route following the detachment. One rifle platoon was 
assigned to each battery commander in the event of a surprise 
encounter with the enemy. The artillery battalion commander 
proceeded with the detachment commander at the head of his 
column. A team of "navigators" was assigned from the artillery 
battalion to ensure nonstop movement in the absence of 
large-scale maps. The team's duties included: selecting lines of 
march, marking the route, and setting up markers for bypassing 
impassable sectors. 
  A team of sappers followed immediately behind the 
"navigators." They cleared difficult sectors and helped 
battery personnel pull the guns. 
  On ascents and descents of 40 degrees or more, the guns 
were raised or lowered using pulley blocks. When crossing swampy 
sectors, they were moved by hand. The guns were brought across 
mountain rivers using steel cables and pulley blocks. Despite 
all the difficulties of the march, the artillery battalion and 
pursuit detachment reached the area of Kotala at the designated 
time, where the withdrawal of enemy units was expected. 
  The rifle subunits immediately deployed into battle 
formation with the front to the east, and the artillery 
battalion prepared to open fire against enemy columns in case 
they tried to pass through Kotala. The artillery battalion 
commander moved the gun batteries up to positions for opening 
direct fire. 
  The howitzer battery occupied an indirect-fire 
position, ready to engage enemy columns on the approach to 
Kotala. 
  The subunits of the detachment and artillery battalion 
deployed into battle formation secretly to ensure surprise. 
Special attention was given to reconnaissance of the approaches 
to Kotala on the part of the enemy. Each gun crew was tasked to 
organize a perimeter defense. As subsequent events showed, all 
these measures were fully justified. The appearance of our 
subunits, reinforced by artillery, deep in the enemy's rear was 
totally unexpected for the enemy. 
  At 0500 hours 18 November, detachment security reported 
the approach of a large enemy column (up to 3.5 km long). When 
the head of the column approached to within point-blank range of 
the line occupied by our subunits, it was met with organized 
artillery and infantry fire. The column was defeated in a 
brief engagement. Our subunits firmly held an important area in 
the enemy's rear on the path of his withdrawal, which ensured 
the successful advance by our main body. The guns that were 
moved up for direct fire played the main role in defeating the 
enemy.
