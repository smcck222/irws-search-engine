"Refugees and Emigrants: How Is a Catastrophe to Be Averted? It 
Is Necessary To Take Some Measures Urgently"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Causes and Specifics of Forced Migration </H5>
  Migration geared toward the interests of the economy and 
production and predicated on regional imbalances in labor 
resources, territorial differences in the standard of living, 
and uneven distribution of jobs and places of study prevailed in 
Russia and other republics of the former USSR until the 
mid-1980's. Forced migration of the population picked up in the 
Russian Federation beginning in the mid-1980's. 
  The problem of interethnic relations, which generates the 
terrifying phenomenon of refugees, is becoming the foremost 
problem among the factors inducing forced migration. 
Unemployment caused by economic crisis became a second factor 
inducing migration of the population. The growth of unemployment 
everywhere in combination with interethnic conflicts aggravated 
two interconnected problems--refugees and mass emigration. 
  The third cause of forced migration, ecological catastrophes 
and natural disasters, is also important. Chernobyl, the Aral 
Sea basin, the Semipalatinsk region, and Novaya Zemlya are the 
best-known foci of such catastrophes. 
  At present, as in the 1980's, the demographic potential of 
the Russian Federation increases by virtue of interrepublic 
migration processes. However, for a long time now the migratory 
flow has consistently trended down. Between 1981 and 1985 Russia 
received an average of 185,300 people a year as a result of the 
interrepublic redistribution of the population, and in 
1986-1990--156,600 people, whereas in 1991 the inflow of labor 
resources to the republic came to just 51,600 people. 
  Qualitative changes have also occurred in the nature of 
migration processes in Russia. 
  Firstly, the attraction of northern and eastern regions, 
which have a labor shortage, diminished; in the late 1980's 
these regions began to experience population loss. For example, 
population loss due to migration in Western Siberia and the Far 
East increased by factors of 15 and seven, respectively, in 1991 
as compared to 1990. 
  Second, the migratory outflow of the population (as a result 
of diminishing needs for out-of-town labor and a sharp increase 
in the cost of living) caused a reduction in population in the 
cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg by 0.5 and 0.6 percent, 
respectively, in 1991, which had not been registered previously. 
  Third, population inflow to southern regions of the republic 
has picked up. Compared to 1990, the number of migrants to the 
North Caucasus increased by a factor of almost two in 1991. The 
main role in this was played by streams of refugees and 
displaced persons resettling in North Ossetia, Krasnodar Kray, 
Stavropol Kray, and Rostov Oblast. 
<H5>  Hidden Discrimination and the Russian Issue </H5>
  As has already been said, since the late 1980's forced 
migration has become a new feature and the most acute problem in 
migration-related exchange of population between Russia and 
neighboring foreign countries. Aggravation of interethnic 
relations and discrimination along ethnic lines and language and 
political convictions were the reasons for the forced migration 
of the population. 
  The above negative trends of national isolationism emerged 
in 
many republics as early as the 1960's and 1970's. Individuals of 
the indigenous nationality were recruited into leadership 
positions in all areas of public life, and by the beginning of 
the 1980's they were absolutely prevalent in numerical terms. 
Principles of ethnic background, clannishness, and territorial 
affiliation got the upper hand in cadre policy. Colleges of the 
republic ended up in a sphere of particularly strong influence 
of unfavorable manifestations. The policy of preferential 
admission to colleges of individuals of the indigenous 
nationality was deliberately promoted in the republics. 
Disproportions developed between the ethnic structure of the 
student body and the ethnic structure of the population of many 
republics. 
  At present almost 28 million Russians (according to the 1989 
census of the population), as well as citizens of other 
nationalities which have national-state entities in the 
territory of Russia, reside in the territory of the former 
Union, beyond the boundaries of Russia. The latter nationalities 
are the Tatars, Jews, Ossetians, Bashkir, Mordvinians, Chuvash, 
Chechens, Udmurt, and Mari. 
  Russians account for 25.3 million, or almost 91 percent of 
citizens of the above nationalities. Among the largest other 
nationalities let us note the Tatars--1,127,000 people (4 
percent) and Jews--841,000 (3 percent). 
  Apparently, the Russian issue will remain dominant in the 
tangle of migration-related problems in the years to come. In 
1991, 42 percent of non-Russian students and 29 percent of 
professors of colleges of the former USSR believed that the 
Russian people have always aspired to dominate and suppress 
other peoples and nations. In the consciousness of these people 
the policy of the Soviet party and political leadership and the 
role and lot of the Russian people are identical notions. 
  The situation of Russians in interethnic relations with the 
indigenous nationalities of the former Union is complicated by 
the fact that, despite the rejection of nationalism, their 
position is not supported culturally. Thus, the proportion of 
those who have command of a second language among Russians 
ranges from 1 percent in Kazakhstan to 37 percent in Lithuania. 
  In all republics, the proportion of Russians who are fluent 
in the language of the indigenous nationality falls far short of 
one-half. The statistics are highest in Ukraine, Armenia, 
Lithuania, Georgia, and Latvia (one-fifth). The numbers are 
extremely small in the former republics of Central Asia--from 
0.9 percent to 4.5 percent. 
<H5>  Migration Projections </H5>
  Outside of Russia, Russians are mainly concentrated in four 
former Union republics. 
  The former republics should be divided into several zones 
from the standpoint of the possible scale of the movement of 
Russians to Russia. The first embraces those who reside in 
Ukraine and Belarus--12.7 million people, or just over one-half 
of all Russians beyond the borders of Russia. These are 
republics with long-standing, traditionally strong bonds with 
the Slavic peoples. Apparently they cannot be considered a 
source of forced migration of any consequence. 
  The second zone, represented by Kazakhstan, with 6.2 million 
Russians, approximates the first. Until recently the historical 
conditions for the formation of the population there provided a 
relatively favorable background for the residence of Russians. 
  Uzbekistan, with 1.7 million Russians, belongs to the third 
zone. In the consciousness of the Uzbeks, the quite high 
industrial potential (compared to other Asian republics of the 
former Union) is associated with the inflow of a considerable 
amount of skilled Russian cadres during the Great Patriotic War. 
The postwar boost to the industrial potential of the republic 
was associated with the replenishment of Russian cadres to a 
considerable degree. Apparently, Uzbekistan should not be viewed 
as a zone for a mass resettlement of Russians. 
  A relatively large proportion of Russians (about 5 million) 
is concentrated in the fourth zone, to which the rest of the 
republics of the former Union belong. The Baltic states, 
Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, and Moldova are among these 
republics. The mere enumeration of these territories with the 
most unfavorable social situation testifies to the fact that 
these are zones from which the most intensive forced migration 
of Russians should be expected. 
  However, the main characteristics of interethnic relations 
in 
the Baltic area indicate a high degree of cultural compatibility 
between Russians and the majority of the population of these 
states. 
  In Georgia and Armenia, half of the resident Russians were 
born in these parts, and about a quarter come from resident 
families. Until recently mutual relations among Russians, 
Armenians, and Georgians gave no rise to concern. However, 
flareups of interethnic conflicts indirectly worsen the 
situation of the Russians. 
  In the European regions, the standing of Russians is 
comparatively the worst in Moldova. The situation in the 
Dniester area has promoted tension in relations between 
Moldovans and Russians. 
  The most unfavorable conditions for the residence of Russian 
minorities have developed in the region that includes 
Azerbaijan, Dagestan, Chechnya, and the republics of Central 
Asia. This region accounts for up to 80 percent of the entire 
last Russian emigration. 
  Between one-third and one-half of the almost 1.1 million 
former Russian local residents have already left the most 
unstable Muslim republics of the former USSR--Tajikistan and 
Azerbaijan. Many Russians have left even more stable republics, 
such as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Russian populations 
accounted for between 8 and 13 percent in these four republics. 
In Kyrgyzstan this statistic came to 26 percent, and in 
Kazakhstan--41 percent. Now that the Muslims are coming to power 
and becoming a majority, Russians feel less secure. 
  The flight of Russians from the Muslim republics began in 
earnest four years ago. In Dushanbe fewer than one-half of the 
300,000 original Russian residents remain. 
  Nonetheless, fewer than 20 percent of all Russians residing 
beyond the borders of Russia may be considered potential 
refugees. 
  Some projected estimates considerably exaggerate the refugee 
problem. Prospects for forced migration are most likely 
associated with the Russian populations of the Baltic area, 
Azerbaijan, Transcaucasia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Moldova, 
and Georgia. Uzbekistan may provide "sustenance" to some extent, 
and probably Kazakhstan (to a much smaller degree). The Russian 
Federation may consider 6 million Russians residing in 
neighboring foreign countries, out of 25.3 million, potential 
refugees. The figure of 2 million refugees coming to Russia in 
the immediate future is viewed as quite realistic. 
<H5>  Reception and Resettlement Problems </H5>
  Russians are mainly clustered in urban areas. The proportion 
of urban population among Russians is much higher than among the 
indigenous population. This is particularly characteristic of 
Central Asia, Azerbaijan, and Transcaucasia. There are many more 
Russians among the urban population than there are among rural 
residents. The greatest numbers of Russians reside in large 
cities. This picture is due to the professional structure of the 
Russian population. Russians aspired primarily to work in 
industrial sectors, in the areas of science and education. This 
is particularly noticeable in the Asian states of the CIS. 
  Therefore, the problems of Russians beyond the borders of 
Russia are mostly problems of the urban population, to the 
greatest degree--of those in large cities. This suggests that 
the probable refugees will have to be accommodated and placed in 
jobs mainly in the cities. The existing view about the extensive 
potential of the rural areas of Russia in this instance is 
illusory. 
  Forced migration of the population cause problems both for 
the resettlers themselves and the residents of regions they 
enter. The settlement of migrants is one such problem. 
  The indicator of refugees holding residence permits as a 
proportion of the total number of registered refugees reflects, 
to a certain degree, adjustment at new locations and 
resettlement. By the end of 1991 less than 40 percent of 
refugees had obtained residence permits (and, therefore, had 
been dropped from the rolls) in Russia as a whole. This 
situation was largely due to difficulties in the permanent 
resettlement of migrants. The greatest numbers of forced 
migrants settled in Vladimir, Kursk, Orenburg, Orel, Ulyanovsk, 
Samara, and Astrakhan Oblasts, and in Tatarstan--since 1991, 
more than 90 percent of the refugees arriving there have 
obtained residence permits. At the same time, no more than 
one-third of the arriving refugees had obtained residence 
permits in Kabardino-Balkaria, Krasnodar Kray, Ivanovo, Penza, 
and Tambov Oblasts, and only 2 percent--in North Ossetia. 
  On the whole a trend may be noted toward an outflow of 
refugees from the central and northern territories of Russia to 
the southern regions. At present, 70 percent of all refugees are 
concentrated in the southern regions of the Russian Federation: 
North Ossetia, Krasnodar Kray, Stavropol Kray, and Rostov Oblast. 
  Immense difficulties develop in the job placement of 
refugees. Specialists estimate that just over two-thirds of the 
total number of migrants who wish to work will be able to find 
work. According to conservative estimates, more than 2 million 
jobs will be needed if events take an unfavorable turn. This may 
substantially worsen the situation on the labor market in 
Russia, especially in some of its regions. 
  It is possible to predict that in the environment of overall 
socioeconomic and political instability, the streams of refugees 
will remain extensive into the mid-1990's because new hotbeds of 
tension continue to emerge at present, as well. At the beginning 
of 1990 there were 25 of them in the territory of the former 
Union, whereas by March 1991 there were three times as many--76. 
<H5>  Emigration </H5>
  We should note one more alarming phenomenon: some refugees, 
disappointed in the ability of the state to protect their 
interests, have lost faith in the opportunity to normalize their 
lives within the country and are becoming emigrants. 
  Looking for salvation from economic difficulties, citizens 
of 
the former USSR are resorting to various tricks, circumventing 
laws, quotas, and so on. Thus, many Russians and representatives 
of other nationalities are leaving the country, together with 
Germans, Jews, and Greeks, using ethnic emigration. For example, 
of the 186,000 Soviet emigrants who arrived in Israel in 1990 
alone, Russians and representatives of other non-Jewish 
nationalities accounted for 35 percent. The refugee problem has 
thus grown from a domestic into an international one. 
  In the late 1980's, emigration from the former Union had 
already become precipitous, as statistics testify: in the 45 
years since the war about 2.5 million people left the country, 
whereas in four years (1987-1990), about 1 million people left, 
or 38 percent of the entire outflow. Since 1986 the outflow has 
increased sharply every year. According to data from the USSR 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, in 1986 only 4,000 people 
emigrated abroad from the USSR, in 1987--as many as 29,000, in 
1988--75,000, in 1989--235,000, and in 1990, 600,000 citizens 
left the country. In 1991 the outflow doubled, and this number 
will keep growing. 
  According to some projections, up to 7 million people may 
emigrate from CIS countries for permanent residence abroad 
within 10 years, of whom no fewer than 1.5 million will be 
specialists and 1.5 million will be skilled workers. According 
to other estimates, about 2 million people awaited the Law on 
Exit in order to embark on work abroad, and another 5-6 million 
are morally prepared to take this step. 
  There are many refugees in the stream of emigrants because 
the most skilled segment of refugees (18 percent of those polled 
in various regions of the country) are oriented toward migrating 
abroad. 
  Most emigrants (about 40 percent) are residents of Moscow 
and 
St. Petersburg and Moscow and Leningrad Oblasts; 8 percent are 
residents of Omsk Oblast, 6 percent--residents of Altay Kray, 
and 5 percent--of Orenburg Oblast. 
  However, the severalfold growth of emigration is hardly 
possible in the immediate future because the actual scale of 
departures will depend not only on the number of people in 
Russia who strive to go abroad but also on the immigration 
capacity of receiving countries whose potential is limited. 
  During the period of a mounting third wave of emigration 
from 
the republics of the former Union, a number of states changed 
the tactics of immigrant reception, making their qualitative 
selection stricter. Thus the leading universities of Europe and 
America and the research departments of multinational 
corporations will be able to place in jobs up to 200,000 leading 
scientists and specialists in the next few years to come. This 
is why, to Russia, emigration of the population means primarily 
loss of highly skilled specialists and intellectual, creative 
potential. 
<H5>  Necessary Measures </H5>
  Therefore, two of the most acute migration-related problems 
of the present day, those of refugees and emigrants, are closely 
intertwined because a considerable proportion of refugees are 
potential emigrants. It is necessary to take this circumstance 
into account in developing a modern migration policy. It is 
necessary to urgently do the following in order to avert a 
catastrophe associated with swelling streams of refugees and 
forced migrants: to put representatives of the migration service 
on the staff of embassies and consulates of all states of the 
former USSR; to establish, on a parity basis with other CIS 
states, an organization similar to the International Migration 
Organization; to set forth the status of dual citizenship and 
bilingualism with the preservation of Russian as the second 
state language; to admit CIS countries to the International 
Migration Organization and the Office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees; to provide moral, financial, and 
organizational assistance to Russian and Russian-language 
communities in establishing cultural and educational centers and 
similar centers of other nations in Russia; to take political, 
legal, and financial measures aimed at overcoming the forced 
migration of representatives of national minorities, the 
Russian-speaking population.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Domestic Commodity Producers Demand </F>
Protection of Their Interests: Yuriy Skokov and Viktor 
Chernomyrdin Reach an Understanding"] 
  [Text] As NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has already reported, the 
Second Commodity Producers of Russia Federation (FTR) Congress 
was held at the end of December in Krasnoyarsk. 
  Formed in November 1992, the Commodity Producers of Russia 
Federation unites federal, republic, kray, and oblast branch 
unions, associations, and other combines of commodity producers. 
Its founders include the Association of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs of Russia, the Agrarian Union of Russia, the 
League of Assistance to Defense Enterprises, the Russian Union 
of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and the Russian Union of 
Labor Collectives. The congress adopted a decision on membership 
of the FTR for the Union of Oil Industrialists and the Trade and 
Industry Chamber of Russia. 
  The forum delegates adopted in respect to the results of the 
work a Declaration on the Rights of Commodity Producers of the 
Russian Federation. 
  In accordance with a resolution of the congress, the 
Federation Council Presidium was instructed to convey to the 
president of the Russian Federation and the Federal Assembly and 
Government of Russia the main proposals and demands of the 
congress. 
  As follows from the documents of the congress and the debate 
conducted within its framework, the FTR's main goals for the 
transitional period are protection of the rights and 
representation of the interests of the combines of commodity 
producers of Russia in the organs of state power and 
administration, furtherance of the development of domestic 
industry, the agrarian sector, and enterprise and the formation 
of a system of social partnership, and the enhancement of the 
social prestige and the revival of the historical traditions of 
Russia's commodity producers. 
  The by-laws of the federation, which were approved by the 
Second FTR Congress, have now been registered with the Ministry 
of Justice of the Russian Federation. 
  In accordance with an instruction of the congress, FTR 
Chairman Yuriy Skokov will hold consultations with the 
Government of Russia, the leaders of factions of deputies of the 
Federal Assembly, the leaders of political parties and 
grassroots movements and organizations, and entrepreneurs for 
the formulation of a concerted position on questions of 
socioeconomic policy taking account of the interests of the 
commodity producers. 
<H3>  Declaration of the Rights of Commodity Producers of the 
Russian Federation </H3>
  We commodity producers, enterprise outfits, managers 
(directors), and entrepreneurs--all who are employed in the 
sphere of commodity production, regardless of forms of 
ownership, types of economic activity, and political 
persuasion--affirm that: 
  --the building of a democratic federal state based on the 
rule of law is possible only on condition of the reform of the 
economy for the creation of efficiently functioning commodity 
production; 
  --the chosen model of radical economic transactions in 
Russia 
has brought about a progressive decline in commodity production 
and increased crisis. Account is not being taken of the fact 
that the entire infrastructure of the country's industrial, 
technological, and scientific and technological potential was 
formed under fundamentally different conditions and that for its 
adaptation to a truly market environment a transitional period 
is necessary. 
  The fundamental goal of the reforms--a rise in Russians' 
living standard--is being sacrificed. 
  The Federation advocates the implementation of reforms and 
sets as its goal recognition and protection of the rights of the 
commodity producers based on self-organization and the 
harmonization of their interests in the process of reform of the 
economy. 
<H3>  The Commodity Producers Federation, Recognizing Its 
Responsibility to the Country and Society, Declares: </H3>
  --its right to conclude a master agreement with the 
government of the Russian Federation enshrining a qualitatively 
new system of mutual relations in the implementation of economic 
transformations for the creation of efficient commodity 
production; 
  --its right to devise and sign as quickly as possible with 
the organs of state power of components of the Russian 
Federation regional agreements for the formulation of the 
optimum mutually acceptable mechanisms of economic reform 
locally; 
  --its right to participate in the elaboration of all 
legislative instruments and enforceable enactments concerning 
commodity production and to submit them for consideration to the 
Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and other organs of 
state power in accordance with current legislation; 
  --its right to assurance by the state of protection of the 
vitally important interests of the commodity producers as an 
essential condition of the preservation and strengthening of 
Russia. The state's self-withdrawal from the accomplishment of 
the tasks of support for domestic commodity production is 
impermissible; 
  --its right to support by the state for the priorities of 
the 
domestic commodity producers in the process of privatization. We 
are opposed to the rash redistribution of the national wealth to 
the detriment of the vast majority of the population; 
  --its right to a long-term state protectionist policy in the 
interests of the domestic commodity producers. We support 
Russia's active inclusion in the world market in the interests 
of the national economy, but we are opposed to the conversion of 
our fatherland into a raw material appendage of the developed 
countries; 
  --its right to participate in the creation of a 
comprehensive 
system of social protection of the commodity producers. 
  The Federation will uphold and defend the rights of the 
domestic commodity producers within the framework of current 
legislation in interaction and cooperation with organs of 
federal and regional power and administration and with all 
domestic organizations and movements expressing the interests of 
business circles and the work force. 
<H5>  P.S. </H5>
  A lengthy meeting between Yuriy Skokov and Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin was held recently. The meeting discussed 
problems of Russia's economic and social development, ways of 
extricating commodity production from the profound crisis, and 
questions of support for the interests of the commodity 
producers. As reported by information sources within the 
government, the discussion was of a constructive nature. 
  Yuriy Skokov also met with members of the government and 
also 
leaders of certain factions of deputies.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleksiy Kabyka, chief of the Project for the </F>
Prevention of Toxic Trade of the Ukrainian chapter of 
Greenpeace, under the "SOS!... SOS!... SOS!..." rubric: "`I Do 
Not Want To Live in Somalia....': One Year Has Passed. What Has 
Changed?"] 
  [Text] One year ago to the day, our newspaper 
published an article under this title, which discussed the 
importation of toxic waste to Ukraine. Western "toxic 
intervention" may entail terrifying consequences, of which the 
experience of countries such as Somalia or Romania testifies in 
particular. Oleksiy Kabyka, chief of the Project for the 
Prevention of Toxic Trade of the Ukrainian chapter of 
Greenpeace, continues the discussion of the subject. 
  In January 1993, 230 tonnes of extremely dangerous, 
chemically toxic substances, which were declared as 
"construction materials" and "products of the chemical 
industry," were imported to Ukraine from Germany. These facts 
were revealed by the associates of the Ukrainian chapter of the 
international nongovernmental organization Greenpeace. 
  The freight was shipped by the German companies Rimeks and 
Hannolora Zibrans to the address of the small private enterprise 
Podillya in Rivne. Rimeks is doing its semilegal business by 
exporting waste, various old chemicals, and chemicals unfit for 
use from the territory of the former East Germany to the 
countries of Eastern Europe and the CIS. Incidentally, of the 
three founders of the company which was established in June 
1992, two, Serhiy Furs and Pavlo Shmaliy, were our countrymen. 
The amount of the contract came to 50,000 Deutsche marks. Under 
the contract, Podillya and Rimeks were to receive 25 percent of 
the profits each, and 50 percent was to be used to establish a 
joint venture. Doubts as to the conformity of the freight to 
declarations and contracts arose immediately after its shipment 
to Rivne. As Yudovich, the commercial director of the small 
private enterprise Podillya, stated, "We did not even have an 
idea that all of this, putting it mildly, trash would be 
delivered." Besides, it came out that part of the freight had 
not been declared at all--three drums (approximately 180 
kilograms) of metallic mercury waste had been smuggled in. The 
Security Service of Ukraine instituted criminal proceedings 
precisely on account of the mercury smuggling. 
  For three months, all freight was stored in the compound of 
the Rivne Avtotrans Enterprise. The liquid leaked from the drums 
and even dissolved asphalt. It came close to starting a fire 
during cleaning at a warehouse where dangerous chemical reagents 
were stored: White phosphorus, which was being stored together 
with other substances, self-ignited. 
  In early May, the bulk of the freight was moved to the 
compound of a military unit. Some 10-12 tonnes of rusty drums 
with dried-up paint and varnish, old canisters, and containers 
for solvents and other chemicals were piled up in the open air. 
To reduce the stench at least a little, servicemen poured water 
on them daily, which washed the substances into the ground. The 
most toxic and dangerous part of the freight is being kept at a 
large warehouse, where drums are stored along with military 
materiel. A second case of self-ignition of chemical reagents 
has already been registered. Fortunately, there was no explosion 
or fire--the servicemen smothered the flames with sand and 
dragged the drum that had caught fire out of the warehouse. 
Drums with mercury and pesticides are still being stored in the 
compound of Avtotrans in containers. 
  Following the discovery of dangerous substances among the 
freight, it became an urgent necessity to conduct a competent 
ecological expert review. Having grasped the entire danger after 
the previous inspection of the freight, Ukrainian Greenpeace 
resolved to conduct a more thorough review. It was carried out 
with the resources of a special radiological-toxicological 
laboratory and with the participation of professional German 
chemists from the scientific section of Greenpeace. The results 
indicated that the substances in question are indeed toxic 
(danger levels 1 through 3) and pose a danger not only to the 
health but also to the lives of people. The listing of the 
freight includes dozens of items, in particular chemical 
reagents that are stored in 87 drums and constitute the most 
dangerous part of the freight. This includes poisons such as 
sodium cyanide, arsenic and mercury compounds, and other 
extremely toxic substances. 
  On the territory of Nikolayev Oblast, Greenpeace activists 
have revealed the locations of the storage and burial of toxic 
waste from Germany that was imported to Ukraine between 28 
November 1992 and 15 March 1993 through Ochakov and Nikolayev. 
More than 100 tonnes of these dangerous substances were imported 
by the German companies Hayns Ryulikh Agency, Hannelore 
Zibrands, and, once again, Rimeks, to the address of the 
Nikolayev scientific-production association Pivdenagrokompleks 
and the Ochakov Opttorg under the guise of construction 
materials and chemical industry products. 
  The substances in question were examined by a Greenpeace 
mobile laboratory. The results of the examination showed that 
these chemicals were unsuitable for any use, and that a 
considerable proportion of them were toxic and hazardous to 
human health. 
  More than 10 people saw a doctor with symptoms of poisoning 
after using out-of-date paint which contained a considerable 
concentration of heavy metals. Eight drums with an unknown oily 
liquid were dumped and spilled in a forest stand close to the 
village of Solyani, Nikolayev Oblast. About 80 broken flasks 
with the depiction of a skull and crossbones were found at the 
same location. The grass and forest around had already turned 
yellow. 
  In order to attract attention to these facts, members of 
Greenpeace, wearing gas masks and gray chemical protection gear, 
chained themselves close to the German Embassy, together with 
four drums carrying the danger sign, the inscription "Toxic," 
and the names of cities in Ukraine where dangerous substances 
imported from Germany have already been found. 
  Similar surprises do not arrive only from that direction. An 
old American liner, the United States, whose 
structures hold close to 300,000 square meters of asbestos 
bulkheads and ceilings and about 143 tons of powder insulation 
from asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance, is currently 
moored at the port of Sevastopol, awaiting the final decision of 
a commission concerning its future. According to a plan of the 
ship's owner, Kakhraman Sadikogly, all dangerous materials on 
the ship, including asbestos, should be removed in Sevastopol. 
After the United States is cleansed, it will be 
returned to Turkey. 
  Three weeks ago, this "floating coffin" was expelled from 
Turkey after protest actions by Greenpeace, local ecological 
movements, trade unions, and the government of the country. 
Turkey did not accept the ship, taking into account possible 
ecological consequences and the potential danger of asbestos 
removal work, which calls for special conditions to protect the 
health of the workers. 
  The danger of asbestos, a needle-shaped crystal which may 
split into the thinnest of fibers, physically affects cells, 
which brings about cancerous diseases. Asbestos dust entering 
the lungs and the digestive tract is deposited there and brings 
about mesothelioma, asbestosis, peritonitis, and cancer of the 
pleura. Even contact with a person who has been working with 
asbestos is dangerous to those around him. 
  The city authorities of Sevastopol, which already suffers 
from difficult ecological problems, are cynically preparing a 
slow death from cancer for the residents of the city. Measures 
to completely ban the use of asbestos are being taken in many 
Western countries, where the danger posed by it has been fully 
recognized. For example, Sweden and Denmark already have 
legislation that rules out any use of asbestos. According to 
even the Ukrainian standards, asbestos dust, along with 
hydrocyanic acid, are considered Class 1 dangerous substances. 
  Greenpeace is demanding that the German Government and the 
owner of the United States take timely measures to 
take back from Ukraine the dangerous waste. Ukraine needs a 
complete legislative ban on the importation of waste from abroad 
in order to prevent such scandalous cases and problems in the 
future. 
  When this article was ready to be printed, it became 
known that German toxic waste experts had finally arrived in 
Ukraine. They visited the locations of the storage of German 
waste in various regions of the republic and examined them. The 
conclusion drawn by the experts is that the waste should be 
processed locally, i.e., in Ukraine. Greenpeace does not agree 
with this, and demands that the waste be shipped back. 
  On 17 November, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed 
the Decree on the Provisional Statute for the Issuance of 
Permits for the Importation of Recyclable Raw Materials and 
Waste Replacing Them to the Territory of Ukraine. The 
establishment of a catalog of the groups of substances and 
materials classified as dangerous wastes which will be banned 
from import to Ukraine is envisioned. This legislative act gives 
us hope that such incidents will be impossible in the 
future.

Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine under 
the "Here and There" rubric: "An Ecological Program for 
Polissya"] 
  [Text] A difficult ecological situation has developed in 
Polissya as a result of large-scale drainage projects (on an 
area of more than 2.5 million hectares). It was complicated 
further by the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station. 
In total, about 5.9 million hectares of land have been polluted, 
of which 3 million hectares are farmland. 
  A zone of adverse ecological influence extending along a 
radius of two to three kilometers is immediately formed around 
the drained territories. This zone exceeds the drained area by 
factors of four or five. On 0.25 million hectares of sandy soil, 
the yields of potatoes fell by 18 percent; of flax, by 22 
percent; and of winter rye, by 27 percent. 
  The level of subsurface water in summer came down by almost 
one meter. One-half of the small rivers are tied to land 
reclamation systems, which has brought about the internal 
redistribution of their runoff; at times, water becomes unfit 
for use. 
  The number of typical marshland plant species declined by 
more than one-half. The area of cranberry bogs fell from 93,000 
to 23,000 hectares. The environment for the reproduction of wild 
fauna was disrupted; the area of hunting grounds was reduced. 
The fish catch dropped by a factor of almost five. Forests are 
drying up over a considerable area. 
  For this reason, taking into consideration these unfavorable 
changes in the environment of the region, the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources of Ukraine has 
prepared and submitted for coordination the draft decree of the 
Cabinet of Ministers "On Developing and Implementing a Program 
of Priority Measures for the Abatement of the Unfavorable Effect 
of Land Reclamation by Drainage and Radioactive Contamination on 
the Ecological Condition of Polissya." 
  Within the framework of this program, it is envisaged to 
suspend the draining of marshes and forests in the territory of 
Polissya and to switch to the technical retrofitting of drainage 
systems with a view to improving their effectiveness.

<F P=106> [Article by O. Lystopad: "A Graveyard With an Area of </F>
420,000 Square Kilometers"] 
  [Text] Recently, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine 
issued Decree No. 867 on Pollution Abatement Measures in the 
Northwestern Section of the Black Sea in the Odessa Area. The 
measures envisioned by the decree--the repair of existing 
systems and the construction of new sewer, water-treatment, and 
water supply systems in Odessa, the removal of the Odessa Oil 
Refinery, the Odessa oil tank farm, and the oil harbor beyond 
the city limits of Odessa--have been the cherished dream of all 
Odessa "greens." 
  However, the joy is overshadowed by the understanding that 
these measures are the "payoff" for the construction, in the 
vicinity of Odessa, of an oil terminal designed to receive 40 
million tonnes of oil a year. It will cause a multitude of 
ecological problems. Let us examine them beginning with the 
end--the end of the Black Sea and the resorts of Odessa. 
Unfortunately, this is not an exaggeration. Here are the 
statistics: When each tonne of refinery products is offloaded, 
70 grams, on the average, spill into the sea (the water area of 
the port). A trifle? However, these 70 grams must be multiplied 
by 40 million. Here we are! That sounds more convincing--2,800 
tonnes, all the more so because, according to calculations by 
Professor O.H. Mironov (the Sevastopol branch of the Institute 
of Biology of the Southern Seas), the self-cleaning capacity of 
the Black Sea comes to only 2,600 tonnes a year. Therefore, dear 
gentlemen, you may strike the Odessa area from the list of 
Ukrainian resorts. The difference of 200 tonnes will suffice in 
order to dirty the entire Bay of Odessa and all the beaches of 
Odessa from Luzanivka to Chornomorka: One cubic meter of oil 
spills in a film that covers 10 square kilometers! As a result, 
the functioning of the "water area-atmosphere" system is 
disrupted, along with uncontrollable climatic changes, and 
phytoplankton (that is, the lungs of the sea) die en masse. The 
further it goes, the worse it becomes. Crustaceans and worms 
perish, as do fish, because of famine and suffocation. New fish 
will not hatch, because the spawn will have perished even 
earlier. We will not be the only ones left without fish: There 
will be none in the Black Sea; after all, the Odessa bank 
ensures 70 percent of the biological productivity of the sea. 
This is a maternity ward from which 60 percent of all Black Sea 
fish come. What about the people? Some will be looking for 
work--fishing kolkhozes and other enterprises whose names begin 
with "fishing" will be ruined. Others, those who have managed to 
catch and eat the fish, will be patients in oncologic hospitals: 
Toxic components of oil may accumulate in fish in large amounts. 
In addition, an accident may occur at the 25-kilometer-long 
pipeline, and an accident involving oil intake equipment. 
Finally, there are tanker accidents. Let us once again turn to 
statistics that testify that there is an upward trend in the 
number of accidents with large oil spills: in 1986--one 
accident, in 1987--five accidents, in 1988--21 accidents, and in 
1989--39 accidents! The sea in the Odessa area resembles 
Deribasivska Street in Odessa itself. However, a collision of 
two pedestrians on Deribasivska causes nothing but a colorful 
shouting match, whereas a similar collision at sea will end in 
more than a shouting match. 
  Supporters of the terminal respond to the danger of 
pollution 
of the sea with oil: We will call in oil-sweeper vessels, and 
they will clean everything up. S.K. Dolinskiy, chief of the 
State Inspectorate for the Protection of the Black Sea, is 
considerably more pessimistic: They will succeed in cleaning up 
only 10 percent of the spilled oil. Incidentally, if one of our 
tankers "splashes" oil somewhere close to someone else's shores, 
we will have to pay large fines and compensation for damages. 
Turkey has stated its reluctance to let our tankers through its 
straits for a reason. After all, the risk of collision increases 
many times over in these narrow sea passages. Is there an 
opportunity to reduce risk? Yes! First, tankers should be 
unloaded in a closed port. The oil harbor that operates in 
Odessa is ready to receive 4 million tonnes of oil right now, 8 
million tonnes after two weeks of work on its reconstruction, 
and 12 million tonnes in two months--as much as the first phase 
of the terminal is designed to receive. It will be the same 
amount of oil, but less money for reconstruction. Besides, as 
has already been noted, it will be cheaper. Almost 90 percent of 
the oil may be cleaned up in the enclosed space of the harbor, 
and the rest will pollute only the harbor itself. If 
reconstruction is carried out in keeping with the requirements 
of the "greens," the issue of removing the harbor beyond the 
city limits may be obviated. The collective of the port of 
Odessa has submitted such proposals to all interested echelons. 
Somehow, nobody has responded. Was it because they would have to 
travel to Odessa rather than England for negotiations? 
  The reduced tonnage of oil tanker vessels is another way to 
prevent accidents--tankers one-third the size of those that 
carry 100,000-150,000 tonnes. Such vessels may be built at our 
shipbuilding plants in Kerch, Kherson, and Nikolayev. Instead, 
orders "sail" to the Federal Republic of Germany, for some 
reason. Our countrymen are being left without work, while the 
government intends to keep German shipyard workers fed. 
  We have already mentioned the advantage of business trips 
abroad over local ones. Could this be a more serious issue? But 
then it falls within the jurisdiction of the Security Service to 
clarify it. The Security Service should also evaluate this 
entire project from the point of view of security. This will 
simply be a juicy morsel for terrorists, both domestic and 
foreign. If the maritime segment of the terminal is sabotaged, 
the entire country will be left without "black blood." On-shore 
installations are even more attractive. They are located side by 
side with the Odessa plant adjacent to the port. In addition to 
burning oil, there will be ammonia clouds that will turn Odessa 
and its vicinity into one big cemetery within a few hours. If 
the Security Service has no time to work on this, the military 
may be asked to. They have considerable experience in operating 
terminals. If there is such a predicament, then why build a new 
terminal? Could we not use the existing terminals of the Black 
Sea Fleet? Implement conversion! 
  Enough talking about the Security Service and the Ministry 
of 
Defense. There is, after all, a special Ministry! Of 
Environmental! Protection! This is who should be sounding the 
alarm! To be sure, the Ministry of Environmental Protection 
objects to the entire project, and is even demanding that the 
designers explain: Why do we need specifically 40 million tonnes 
of oil? However, the ministry did consent to the first phase, 
failing to understand that having said "A," it will have to say 
"B." The reason for this decision may be that, although the 
ministry has enough qualified experts at the middle and lower 
levels, it is still run by, putting it mildly, nonprofessionals. 
  Therefore, some oil should be brought in through the oil 
harbor, and some through the terminals of the Black Sea Fleet. 
What about the rest? Could it be that even this is enough? Who 
said that we need precisely 40 million tonnes of oil? Does this 
40 million include the 8 million tonnes that our traders shipped 
across the border (incidentally, once again, where was the 
Security Service?). 
  An interesting fact: Some give the number of 100-150 million 
tonnes, rather than 40 million. Here is another one: According 
to data from the Odessa Social and Ecological Alliance, yet 
another oil refinery in the vicinity of Odessa is being 
designed. The design of the terminal itself provides for an 
outer harbor--an installation that is intended to export rather 
than import oil. The following picture emerges: We receive oil, 
refine it, give 50 percent back to the owner of the oil, and 
keep 50 percent, along with all the smoke, dust, smog, and so 
on. Beautiful, is it not? The "gasoline" problem will be solved. 
Hail to the "banana" Republic of Ukraine! We will sell out the 
health of our citizens, but in exchange we will have food to 
feed them with so that they will not rise up and demand early 
elections to the Supreme Council.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivan Besyada: "The United States and Russia Are </F>
Interested in Ukraine Being Weak: This Was Confirmed Yet Again 
by Bill Clinton's Visit to Kiev and Moscow"] 
  [Text] The election of Bill Clinton as President of the 
United States of America was generally received with approval by 
national-democratic circles of Ukraine. This was a victory of 
American democratic forces over the forces of world capital that 
wish to lay their hands on everything and anything. However, 
having embarked on reforms within the country, the new U.S. 
President has continued in its entirety the foreign policy 
course of his predecessors--to intervene in the affairs of 
others and dictate their will under the guise of "protecting 
national interests." By now, many a country has had an 
opportunity to perceive firsthand the genuine essence of this 
superpower. Ukraine has also happened to end up in the sphere of 
Uncle Sam's interests. 
  It was absolutely no accident that Bill Clinton's first trip 
to Europe began with visits to Kiev and Moscow. The appearance 
of Ukraine as an independent state in the world arena does not 
at all serve the interests of the United States. After all, our 
state, with the third largest potential of nuclear weapons in 
the world, may become a weighty factor in the continuous 
confrontation between Europe and America and the latter's 
attempts to retain a superpower image, which has begun to 
decline. For this reason, Uncle Sam immediately began to ponder 
how to deprive the Ukrainians of the missiles deployed 
(incidentally, not by their will) on their soil. It would be 
best to do this with someone else's hands, as always; in this 
case--the hands of Russia, of which Ukraine was a colonial 
dependency for 300 years. That is to say, elementary robbery is 
at issue here. 
  It is precisely from this standpoint that the sojourn of 
Bill 
Clinton in Kiev and Moscow should be viewed. 
  This is why President Kravchuk's promises to meet the 
demands 
of his American colleague concerning the destruction of 
intercontinental ballistic missiles and the transfer of warheads 
to Russia appear very strange. 
  After all, this means Ukraine will be left in the lurch in 
the face of an economic crisis (some experts estimate that 
liquidation of the missiles will cost more than $3 billion) and 
encroachments on our statehood by synthetic Zhirinovskiys (in 
the form of direct aggression) or the no less synthetic 
potentates of world capital (in the form of transforming our 
country into the object of their superenrichment). 
  There are simply no guarantees that this would not happen in 
the event that Ukraine loses its nuclear weapons. The less than 
modest assurances of assistance in the event we are obedient 
cannot be such guarantees. The bitter experience of trusting 
Ukrainians which has been gained during the current century 
alone should have taught us something. Let us recall how the 
so-called free world turned away from the Ukrainian People's 
Republic and how it turned a blind eye to the extermination of 7 
million of our people by Stalin. 
  Bill Clinton's negotiations with Leonid Kravchuk and Boris 
Yeltsin bear out our apprehensions rather than dispel them. A 
mere two-hour stopover at the Boryspil airport with a hastily 
conducted press conference and a two-day visit to Moscow with 
dinners within a narrow circle, a didactic tone with regard to 
Ukraine, and assurances of complete support for Russia--such are 
the two facets of the U.S. President's visit. 
  So, it was quite natural that the actions of President L. 
Kravchuk caused severe criticism from healthy Ukrainian forces, 
including a segment of the members of parliament which was not 
informed about the intentions of its president until the last 
moment. For example, representatives of Rukh and two student 
organizations responded to the Boryspil negotiations by shouting 
the slogans "Kravchuk, retire" and "Kravchuk is a political 
impotent!" 
  Opposition representative Vyacheslav Chornovil described the 
position of Leonid Kravchuk as a betrayal of national interests. 
To his mind, this is a shameful capitulation because Ukraine 
will receive neither guarantees of its security nor major 
compensation. 
  There also is another point of view which characterizes the 
Ukrainian position as maneuvering aimed at averting an economic 
catastrophe. However, the president is not the supreme echelon 
for resolving the momentous issues of the state. There is also 
the parliament, whose position, as is known, is different. There 
also are the Ukrainian people. In particular, People's Deputy 
Larysa Skoryk came out in defense of the actions of the 
president. But our president happens to need defending very 
often; it is time to hold him accountable.

<F P=106> [Article by Margus Mets: "Estonia's Business Landscape 1993"] </F>
  [Text] 
  The 1993 economic year is drawing to a close. Estonia's 
economy has indisputably made some progress, and those in the 
lead have, generally speaking, fared well in their `journey into 
the market economy.' Several groupings sharing common interests 
are being formed in the world of business, and one can also pick 
up rumbles of their mutual conflicts. 
  "Judging by the size of the Domestic Gross Product (DGP) per 
capita, Estonia should be one of the poorest states. Actually, 
people in Estonia are living much better," admitted Aarne 
Tihamets, director of macro-economic services at the Bureau of 
Statistics, to aRIPaEV in October. This statement 
can 
also be used to characterize of Estonia's economy in 1993. 
<H5>  Cynics and Altruists </H5>
  A major bone of contention among politicians and economists 
was the suitability of Toomas Sildmae for the post of 
economic minister, which he assumed in February of 1993. As one 
of the outstanding figures among Estonia's new generation of 
businessmen, Sildmae owns about one tenth of the 
successful 
company known as The Finest Hotel Group. In early May 
Sildmae promised aRIPaEV that, if no one 
else will, 
he will be the one to show that it is possible for a civil 
servant in Estonia to remain honest. "We should not be as 
cynical as to think that everybody is out to rip off the state, 
and build his own business on it. We can assume that there are 
altruists among businessmen, as there are in politics. Over the 
past year, there has been a lot of talk about ethics in 
business, and about business based on ethics. The scandalous car 
and house purchases of Illar Hallaste, member of parliament and 
a former (current?) leading politician of the Pro Patria party 
also made us delve into the problems of altruism and personal 
profit. "Within a few months, I hope to take out a new bank loan 
that will wipe out the previous one, and give me a lower 
interest rate for the future," Hallaste boasted in the fall. 
And, since nothing has been heard about the new loan, should 
aRIPaEV be the one to call for a new limited 
bidding 
between the banks to support the man of God who is trying to 
have his paradise on earth. 
  Or maybe it was with his colleague in mind, that another Pro 
Patria leader Indrek Kannik declared in September that "we 
should not prevent a 10 to 20 percent segment of the population 
from becoming super-rich by our standards, since these are the 
people who will be investing in our economy." 
  "High level politics should be conducted by people who are 
well off financially and who, as a rule, are not susceptible to 
corruption," said Olari Taal, board chairman of the Bank of 
Savings, and by no means one of the poorest. Both Taal and 
Kannik have been in the forefront of the financial oligarchy and 
patriotic politicians for the second half of this year. The 
lines separating idealists and pragmatists are a bit hazy, and 
there may be surprises in the near future. As Indrek Tarand, the 
new advisor to prime minister, once said: "One should invest in 
ideals when young, so there is something to sell out later!" 
<H5>  Banking--Passions Around Kroons </H5>
  Experts consider banking one of the most profitable areas of 
business in Estonia. The year about to end has been no exception 
as, according to mid-year figures, for example, the Hanseatic 
Bank's ratio of profit to the average equity of the period was 
401 percent, computed on an annual basis. Prominent economists 
Sildmae, Taal, Tamjarv and other shareholders of 
the 
bank can easily figure how good a return they are getting on the 
few thousand kroons each of them invested in Rebaco, the 
corporation started by the Hanseatic Bank in 1991. After all, 
the bank's dividends for 1992 that were reinvested in full, 
according to board chairman Hannes Tamjarv, represented a 
yield of 467 percent. 
  The smell of money attracts many fortune hunters, and many 
of 
them have tried to get a money moving license from the Council 
of Bank of Estonia. In February, the central bank's council 
refused to approve the plan to form the Bank of the Three Lions, 
as submitted by Peeter Luik and Sulo Muldia, key shareholders of 
the former United Baltic Bank. The new bank would have been 
formed as a joint venture by Luik, Muldia and shareholders of 
the Viimsi Bank that had lost its operating license. In 
mid-March, these people made a second and the only successful 
attempt, and the resulting Raepank [Guild Bank] has, within nine 
months, become a bank whose successful real estate transaction 
with ETK has caused it to be regarded as one of the most 
successful banks in Estonia. 
  Since a moratorium was placed on issuing banking licenses 
until the end of the stabilization period, competition over 
existing banks and over dividing the market shares has become 
more intense. Also contributing to the tensions is the 
government's plan to specify the extent of the state's 
participation in several of the commercial banks that left a 
nervous tick on the face of many a banker this fall. 
  The real declaration of war on the central bank came from 
justice minister Kaido Kama in October, when he questioned the 
legality of selling shares of the Bank for Savings. While prime 
minister Laar and Bank of Estonia leaders were visiting abroad, 
Kama raised the issue of the sales contract concluded this 
spring between Bank of Estonia and the Hanseatic Bank with 
utmost resoluteness, and demanded that it be cancelled within 
two weeks. Needless to say, the Bank of Estonia did not cave in 
that fast, and certainly not in response to a mere threat, and 
now lawyers on both sides are making a pretty penny trying to 
resolve this complicated case. This court action between the 
government and the central bank, unprecedented in the rest of 
the world, certainly detracts from Estonia's image as `by far 
the most successful of the former socialist countries' and rates 
as one of the biggest joint blunders committed by politicians 
and men of money. 
  The attitude of many Estonian businessmen about their moral 
and legal obligations toward their partners was expressed this 
April in an open letter from Leonid Apananski, director of the 
Revalia bank that was facing bankruptcy at the time and later 
subjected to mandatory liquidation by Bank of Estonia. 
Apananski, who had scuttled the bank with loans extended to his 
own companies, and who took the limelight with setting up the 
weapons transaction between Estonia and Israel, was cynically 
candid with aRIPaEV: "Of course, the bank's owners 
are 
morally responsible for the condition of the bank, but that does 
not mean anything!" 
  As far back as June, Uno Mereste, Council chairman of Bank 
of 
Estonia, had to tone down Apananski's exuberance. "Apananski is 
operating with concepts such as the `ability to pay' and 
`liquidity' in a situation where the bank has loans totaling 13 
million. This amounts to fooling, if not deceiving simple folk," 
said Mereste, commenting on Apananski's attempts to paint white 
over black. The Revalia Bank is currently engaged in court 
battles not only with Bank of Estonia but also with 
aRIPaEV. 
<H5>  Fuel Business on the East-West Trade Route </H5>
  Almost any Estonian businessman of note has at some time 
tried his hand at trading in fuels. This lucrative area of 
enterprise has also brought along several scandals starting from 
the tangled web connecting Klaus, Estonian Fuel and Tartu's Bank 
of Commerce, and the heating oil millions lost in Tartoil, to 
the theft of Sweden's fuel assistance at the beginning of this 
year. 
  In February, the Laar government scored a victory in getting 
rid of Riho Sild, who was heading Estonian Fuel. Sild, who had 
been a convenient scapegoat for Laar for some time, used his 
fall from grace with the government at home to win the hearts of 
our neighbors, and became Estonia's representative to Finland's 
state-owned fuel company Neste. Also abandoned were the 
government's grandiose plans for reforming the state-owned fuel 
company, selling the fuel tank storage park, and coming out with 
the `big is beautiful' slogans. Estonian Fuel was 
also deprived of its new name Eesti Nafta [Estonian Naphtha] 
proposed by Arvo Niitenberg, minister of energetics. 
  The ups and downs of dealing with the financial obligations 
of fuel companies have probably developed into a full time 
activity for some civil servant. On several occasions, at the 
urging of different interest groups, we have heard over and over 
again how the loan guarantees to the Klaus company resulted in 
an indebtedness to TKP [Tartu's Bank of Commerce] which, 
together with late fees, were up to one billion at the time of 
the trial this spring. 
  "Estonian Fuel is an enterprise vital to the state," 
executive director Toomas Saks told BNS in August, after missing 
another deadline for payment. He added that his company is not 
going to be scuttled for the 90 million kroons owing to Tartu's 
Bank of Commerce. "Estonian Fuel is not just some hotel in 
Tallinn," Saks added. 
  In one of its news bulletins, the Bank of Estonia has stated 
that the 90 million kroons in question would make it possible to 
pay the creditors of Tartu's Bank of Commerce roughly 50 percent 
of their claims immediately. Right now, however, the case is 
dragging on, and quite a few unhappy creditors were disturbed by 
the mocking words of the bank's former director Rein Kaarepere, 
as they reached the media around the middle of September. When 
asked: "Last week you were seen in public again. What brought 
that about?" Kaarepere's reply was: "Actually, I have not been 
hiding out at all. In the theater, you can see me even more 
frequently than before." 
  Among the best clients of almost every Estonian bank there 
is 
some successful fuel dealer, whose cash flow and loans bring 
more than an average return for the bank, too. In some cases one 
can even see people with close ties to banking making a smooth 
transition into the fuel business. Examples of this would 
certainly be Andres Ausman, the former head of the credit 
department at the Bank of Tallinn, who joined the leadership 
team of N-Terminaal, Estonia's biggest fuel company; or the move 
made by Mart Kutsar, director of the Bangalo real estate firm 
affiliated with the Bank of Tallinn, to head the Estonian Oil 
Alliance. 
<H5>  Big Investments in the Hotel Business </H5>
  Grandiose hotel projects have been doing well during 
Estonia's period of proprietary capitalism. But the games of big 
shots with big money have also caused a lot of confusion. 
  Accusations of corruption stemming from the 150 million 
kroon 
loan guarantee given to economic minister Toomas Sildmae's 
company The Finest Hotel Group by prime minister Mart Laar are 
only the tip of an iceberg that surfaced late in the fall to 
bring attention to Estonia's hotel business. Sildmae owns 
two thirds of Silfin corporation's 16.3 percent in The Finest 
Hotel Group and, in Estonia's circumstances, this is quite 
sufficient to suspect a person of having committed some sins 
`within the limits of his corruptibility.' 
  The same percentage of shares in the company that has been 
running Tallinn's number one hotel is held by SRV International 
I, that was also one of the chief contenders in the 
privatization battle for hotel Viru. Viru's initial asking price 
of 130 million did not scare off the Finns who have already 
invested in Estonia's enterprises like SRV Eesti Ehitus [RSV 
Estonian Construction] headed by taxpayer Toomas Luman, or in 
the diversified Abe International. 
  The other party coveting Viru, and still in the running, is 
the French hotel chain Accore. Intriguing, in this context, is 
the information received from the French ambassador in Estonia 
maintaining that Accore is planning to build another hotel in 
Tallinn, even if it becomes the owner of Viru. 
  Making waves during the second half of the year was 
Estonia's 
biggest privatization transaction todate--the sale of hotel 
Tallinn for 80 million kroons to its director Tauno Laigo, who 
had been managing it as state property. The Privatization Agency 
has not received any money so far, besides the 900,000 kroons 
for auction participation, and many of Estonia's privatization 
leaders have predicted that the transaction will have to be 
cancelled because of the buyer's inability to pay. As it often 
happens in privatization cases, the matter has been taken to 
court. Laigo himself has been saying, as late as mid-December, 
that the money is forthcoming shortly. 
  Also unrealized, so far, are plans for the hotel Sheraton 
Tallinn, preparations for which were started as far back as 
1989. Construction on the five-star hotel was supposed to begin 
toward the end of March of this year, according to Rein Kuusmik, 
director of AS Amerest Hotels. In February, Kuusmik told 
aRIPaEV that a loan in the amount of 100 German 
marks 
was forthcoming from Germany and Austria to get the project 
going. A handling fee of `only' 12 million DEM had to be raised 
locally. Kuusmik promised further that the hotel being built in 
Tallinn would already be listed in the 1994 edition of the 
worldwide listing of Sheraton hotels. Haven't checked the 
listing yet, but the hotel is nowhere to be seen. 
<H5>  Taxpayers Association </H5>
  When Triinu Rohtla, executive director of the Tallinn 
Taxation Office, reviewed the 1992 tax year in April of this 
year, she said that the record income amount among returns 
processed up that that point was 480,000 kroons. The Taxpayers' 
Association had not been founded, which explains a sum `so low' 
by today's standards. 
  The first to come out as an organized elitiest group of 13 
lawyers, civil servants and educators (Igor Grazin, Siim 
Kallas, Peeter Kilomann, Rein Lang, Toomas Luman, Meelis Milder, 
Juri Raidla, Mart Rask, Andres Sarri, Toomas 
Sildmae, Olari Taal, Hannes Tamjarv and Priit 
Vilba) 
have had their names linked to the most convoluted line of 
reasoning. Indisputably, not much can go on in Estonia's economy 
without these men knowing it. It could also be predicted that, 
over the years to come, we will be hearing more about those 
members of the association not too well known to the public yet. 
Like Peeter Kilomann, who founded the Primex company in June of 
1991 which, by now, has grown into an operation with a sales 
volume of 40 million kroons a month, as its owner told 
aRIPaEV in February. The up-and-coming People's 
Bank 
[Rahvapank] of southern Estonia is also reputedly controlled by 
Kilomann. 
  Rumor has it that Bank of Estonia is planning to take out of 
circulation the one and two-kroon bills that have lost much of 
their value since the monetary reform, and replace them with 
coins. Estonia's business world is also keeping up with renewal 
and, by next year, one can probably start talking about bigger 
business plans, bigger companies and bigger profits. Inevitably, 
the failures, deceptions, scandals and losses will also be 
bigger. Estonia's business landscape is still in the state of 
formation.

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Bolotin, Economics Council expert: "The </F>
Economy. The Language of Figures. Revenues to the CIS"] 
  [Text] The CIS was conceived primarily as an instrument for 
preserving the unified economic space. The leaders of the new 
states understood that nobody would be able to single-handedly 
bring them out of the economic crisis, which was manifesting 
itself in all its depth by 1991, and that this could be achieved 
only through all-around cooperation on a new, mutually 
advantageous basis following the principles of a market economy. 
Declarations of such cooperation were made repeatedly. But, 
concerned about their own difficulties, the new states were 
unable to realize them. The results of this situation, as could 
have been expected, were pathetic. 
  In two years the national income of the CIS countries from 
all sources decreased by one-third. There was an especially 
sharp decline of production in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and 
Tajikistan, which were gripped by armed conflicts. The share of 
these states and also of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, 
where the economic reforms were delayed for various reasons and 
to various degrees, in the CIS production volume from all 
sources decreased (Table 1). 
  Because of this there were greater differences in the levels 
of economic development and well-being of the population of 
individual countries (Tables 2 and 3). As is the practice in 
international statistics, the measure of the level of economic 
development in one country or another is made up of indicators 
of national income calculated per capita of the population and 
per one individual employed in the branches of material 
production. 
  The indicators in all of the tables were obtained by 
translation into a single currency--rubles--taking into account 
differences in the actual price levels in individual countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Titov and Sergey Ivanov: "Twelve Ex-es </F>
Instead of Fifteen Friends"] 
  [Text] We have been living in the CIS since the end of 
1991, when the era of the "indestructible Union" came to an end. 
The majority of experts have pointed out that the Commonwealth 
has gained its "second wind" in the third year of its life. It 
is interesting that the same observers were inclined to express 
the opposite point of view just recently: It is a powerless 
entity, they said, and its days are numbered. They found comfort 
in the knowledge that without this entity, the dissolution of 
the colossal nuclear power would have taken the form of a 
nuclear meltdown, as they put it, instead of a civilized 
divorce.... Now they suddenly have realized that the CIS not 
only has a right to exist, but that neither Russia nor the 
former Soviet republics--Russia's neighbors and partners--can 
get along with it. The three Baltic states are no longer a 
consideration (they are "self-supporting"), but by the time of 
the last conference in Ashgabat, all of the other 12 "ex-es" had 
come together in the CIS. The last of them was Georgia, which 
had had its fill of the drawbacks of sovereignty in October 
1993; Azerbaijan, which had also gone through many ordeals, had 
returned to the fold a short time earlier. But here is the 
question: Exactly what kind of entity is the CIS--an evolving 
system of cooperation and coordination or a means of 
communication during the transition period of the "divorce 
proceedings"? 
  There are significant political forces adhering to both 
views 
in the republics; accordingly, they have different 
interpretations of the Commonwealth's purpose and functions, and 
this introduces discord into their work. Furthermore, as far as 
the general public is concerned, attitudes can quickly undergo a 
total reversal, and this is obvious to more than just the 
sociological community. During the initial period of the 
existence of the CIS, for example, illusions were fostered (and 
with some success) "on the local level" to suggest that the main 
causes of negative developments could be found at the center, 
outside the boundaries of the new sovereign republics. The hopes 
for successful economic separation from other parts of the 
ex-Union were unjustified, however, and these states did not 
acquire more favorable conditions for economic recovery when 
they were "on their own." 
  Recession, impoverishment, social tension, and other such 
problems were present almost everywhere in the CIS instead of 
the anticipated prosperity. In this unfavorable atmosphere, the 
centripetal tendency slowly began to prevail over centrifugal 
forces. The belief that the establishment of different levels of 
consolidation within the Commonwealth of Independent States 
might be the best option in today's difficult circumstances 
gradually gained strength among political scientists and 
experts, and then among the members of the ruling elite in the 
post-Soviet republics. 
  In the most general terms, the multileveled structure of the 
Commonwealth can be described as approximately the following: On 
the first level, the lowest, a system of multilateral and 
bilateral agreements on mutual preferences is taking shape, 
economic and social laws are being coordinated, and the 
infrastructure is being standardized. On the second level, the 
establishment of the Customs Union will create a duty-free and 
license-free zone, a common tax policy is being conducted, and 
commitments are being assumed with regard to the unimpeded 
movement of people, goods, and capital. The final and third 
level of cooperation will be achieved by countries with a common 
currency and a supra-governmental mechanism for decisions on the 
issuance of currency, crediting, and financial exchange. In this 
way, each state belonging to the CIS can choose to be a 
confederate or associate member: In each specific case, 
everything will depend on the prevailing tendency--centripetal 
or centrifugal. Obviously, the former will help a republic "find 
its own place" in the Commonwealth, and the second will have an 
alienating effect. 
  What are the contributing and hindering factors? These are 
mainly economic factors on both sides. As a rule, grim necessity 
prevails over any kind of illusions. Economic conditions in the 
CIS countries range from difficult to catastrophic. As long as 
the economic zone is in a fragmented state, it will be difficult 
to expect improvement, and social indignation will be rampant 
because of the cold and hunger.... Only concerted effort can 
lift an economy out of the ruins. 
  What do the advocates of the other, "centrifugal" point of 
view want? For them, the priorities of sovereignization have not 
lost their luster. They still have hopes for integration within 
the framework of a different structure--a more promising 
structure, in their opinion, than the CIS. These hopes are 
largely impractical and illusory, but they also reflect 
disillusionment with the CIS because of its ineffectiveness and 
its lack of a mechanism to implement decisions. The leaders who 
met at the last regular CIS summit conference approved around 20 
documents pertaining to economic spheres of vital 
importance--taxes, export-import policy, finances, credit.... 
This is an indication that the CIS partners acknowledge these 
new realities, but as far as the implementation of these 
documents is concerned, we will have to wait and see....

<F P=106> [Article by Yefim Logunov: "Russian Diplomacy's View of the </F>
CIS; Ambassadors' Conference: Imaginary Threats and Real 
Problems"] 
  [Text] A conference of Russian ambassadors was held in the 
press office of the RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the 
discussion of foreign policy toward the CIS and Baltic 
countries. The conference was attended by Andrey Kozyrev and a 
large group of Russian diplomats, as well as RF Minister of 
Internal Affairs Viktor Yerin, Deputy Minister of Defense 
Col-Gen Boris Gromov, and other high-level representatives of 
Russian ministries and departments, most of them deputy 
ministers. They discussed a broad range of military-political, 
economic, cultural, humanitarian, and other issues, analyzed the 
situation in the CIS and Baltic countries, examined current 
developments in the interaction of CIS states in different 
spheres, and presented legal assessments of the status of their 
fellow-countrymen in neighboring countries. 
  The speech by the head of the Russian foreign policy 
establishment aroused considerable interest. The minister 
stressed that the CIS and Baltic states constitute the region of 
Russia's primary vital interests and offer colossal 
opportunities for the development of friendly and comprehensive 
relations. The defense of the rights of Russians in these nearby 
foreign countries was called the main strategic objective of 
Russian foreign policy. We have recently been able to achieve 
considerable mutual understanding with our immediate partners, 
including an understanding on the question of dual citizenship. 
Andrey Kozyrev called for the heightened effectiveness of 
existing and projected mechanisms of economic cooperation within 
the CIS framework and a strictly individualized approach in the 
creation of common currencies. (The minister did, however, 
praise the Russian-Belarusian agreement--Ed.) 
  The need to maintain the Russian military presence in the 
sphere of Russian interests was underscored, but this does not 
apply to the Baltic states, although the minister has already 
been accused of planning this. This statement has evoked 
conflicting responses abroad. Moscow is already being asked for 
precise explanations. Washington is angry, and the Baltic states 
launched another of their traditional anti-Russian campaigns. 
(For the details, see yesterday's edition of SEGODNYA--Ed.) 
These worries seem excessive, however. People in Moscow are not 
planning to take any kind of unilateral steps in this direction, 
without considering the opinions of neighboring states. The 
fundamental principle of this kind of military presence is the 
mutual interest of the parties. In addition to bilateral 
agreements, the law of the Russian Federation "On Defense," 
which allows for the deployment of ground and naval forces 
outside Russia with the consent of parliament, can serve as the 
legal basis for stationing Russian troops abroad. 
  Ideas about the problems of the CIS were then expressed by 
the Russian ambassadors, military leaders, and officials from RF 
law enforcement and financial agencies. All of them agreed that 
the Commonwealth is turning into a global factor now that it has 
gone through the complex initial phase of its establishment. 
They mentioned the diversified system of legal treaties within 
the CIS framework. The implementation of the Treaty on 
Collective Security has begun. There is a clear desire to 
restore the common economic zone on a market basis, but this 
will be a slow and gradual process: moving from the simple to 
the complex, from a free trade zone to a free market. 
Military-technical cooperation is being strengthened. The close 
coordination of the operations of foreign trade and customs 
agencies has begun. Joint measures have been taken to protect 
external borders. The idea of forming a group of collective 
forces to keep the peace in "hot spots" in the CIS is arousing 
increasing interest. Concern about the Russians in nearby 
foreign countries must remain a priority of Russian foreign 
policy. The establishment of a special federal agency for the 
protection of the interests of these Russians and the 
negotiation of a CIS convention on dual citizenship were 
suggested. The importance of drafting joint foreign policy 
initiatives for international and regional forums was 
acknowledged. 
  Speakers did not ignore the urgent problems of the 
Commonwealth. Above all, these are the problems that are common 
to all of the new states: the recession, the mounting social 
tension, differences in the speed of economic reform, in budget, 
credit, and monetary policy, and in economic interests, and the 
absence of a single set of economic laws. They mentioned the 
attempts to build an economic union at Russia's expense, 
although this should be done on an equitable basis. Apparently, 
this will not be a simple task. Just in the past year, the CIS 
countries have received credits exceeding 500 billion rubles 
from the Russian republic budget, and the projected figure was 
over 800 billion. The republics still want to buy Russian raw 
materials at heavily discounted prices. A single payment union 
is essential, but the necessary legal and economic prerequisites 
for this are still lacking. 
  Speakers expressed concern about the vulnerability of 
borders, with all of the ensuing negative consequences for 
Russia, particularly when citizens of third countries cross the 
border. Whereas 12 million people crossed the Russian border in 
1913 and 2 million crossed in 1988, the figure last year was 35 
million. Under these conditions, how can border security and 
border control be instituted? This would call for 500 
checkpoints on the border between the Russian Federation and 
Kazakhstan, and all of the moral and political implications of 
this move also have to be taken into account. 
  The activities of Russian diplomats in the CIS states were 
discussed in depth. Speakers mentioned the inadequate 
coordination of the actions of different Russian agencies, and 
the arrival of delegations from some CIS countries in Moscow 
without the advance notification and consent of the Russian 
side. Representatives from the ministries of defense and 
internal affairs, however, expressed satisfaction with their 
interaction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  Speakers mentioned some of the difficulties involved in 
finding suitable work and living premises for Russian diplomatic 
representatives. In this sense, all of our partners are in a 
privileged position in Moscow. The principle of reciprocity 
should apply. The atmosphere of the Russian embassies also 
leaves much to be desired. There are considerable differences in 
wages, because the CIS has its own prestigious and 
nonprestigious "spots." All of these difficulties naturally stem 
from the insufficiency of funds. After the RF Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs submitted its financial requests for embassies 
in the CIS in 1994, the RF Ministry of Finance cut the requested 
foreign currency allocations by 20 percent and ruble allocations 
by 17 percent. The diplomats' subsequent "discussions" with 
representatives of that ministry were futile. The financiers in 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs then promised to find the 
necessary funds to extricate our embassies in the nearby foreign 
countries from their present pathetic state.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin under the rubric "Smolenskaya </F>
Ploshchad": "Guided by Circumstances: More About Russia's 
`Great-Power' Ambitions"] 
  [Text] The editors wish to remind the reader that the 
articles under the rubric "Smolenskaya Ploshchad" express the 
official point of view of the Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. 
  Russia's role in today's world is the subject of continuous 
debate abroad. In spite of all the current difficulties, many 
believe in the democratic aims of Russian foreign policy, 
Russia's commitment to the principles and standards of 
international law, and its wish to join the club of civilized 
states as quickly as possible. Not everyone, however, is pleased 
with the course of Russian domestic reform. The suggestion that 
"great-power" tendencies in Russian foreign policy are growing 
stronger has been instilled in the minds of the world public 
recently. References to the "Russian threat" seem to be back in 
vogue. It is interesting that they were given this new lease on 
life by the same politicians who used them so successfully in 
the cold war years. They include former U.S. Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger, who believes that Russia intends to gain 
"control over the policies of neighboring countries" and weaken 
the North Atlantic alliance. 
  Another former U.S. secretary of state, Zbigniew Brzezinski, 
has advised the creation of a new regional political group, 
consisting of Poland, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and 
Hungary, to counteract all types of "encroachments" by Moscow. 
Sam Nunn, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services 
Committee, has also spoken of Moscow's plans to restore the 
"empire." 
  One of the foreign political analysts' favorite ploys is the 
allegation that interethnic conflicts within the geopolitical 
boundaries of the former USSR are being "instigated" by the 
Russian leadership. They have said that the results of the 
December elections might tempt Moscow to "obscure" its weak 
domestic policy with foreign policy adventurism. 
  Russia's natural wish to defend the rights of the 
Russian-speaking population in the former Soviet republics is 
also seen as a sign of its "great-power" ambitions. Moscow's 
diplomatic moves are interpreted as nothing other than political 
pressure and economic blackmail. Russia's desire to eliminate 
discriminatory trade barriers, which we inherited from the cold 
war and which are preventing the natural integration of the 
Russian economy into the world market economy, has also been 
called a "great-power" objective. Statements of this kind are 
made more frequently just before major international economic 
conferences, such as the recent Tokyo summit of the "Big Seven." 
  Russia's ideas about peacekeeping efforts have also been 
described as "neo-imperialism." The use of these terms is 
certain to undermine Russia's international image during the 
resolution of conflicts within the territory of the former Union 
and question its ability to act as a neutral and trustworthy 
peacemaker. The efforts of Russian diplomats to give Russian 
troops the status of CSCE "blue helmets" in zones of interethnic 
conflict are interpreted as unconcealed attempts at new 
"alterations" of the Eurasian continent. London's INDEPENDENT 
even suggested that the offer of economic aid to Russia should 
be conditional upon Western restrictions on the "intervention" 
by Russian troops in the affairs of nearby foreign countries. It 
is Russia, however, that has the necessary military, political, 
and technical resources for this. 
  Officials in Kiev also like to talk about the "imperial 
claims." When Chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council for 
Foreign Affairs Pavlychko was in Riga recently, for example, he 
said that Russia's foreign policy theories are once again 
acquiring "chauvinistic overtones, because Russia wants to turn 
everyone, especially Ukraine, back into colonies or sections of 
the Russian empire." Most of the lies about Russia's "imperial 
inclinations" originate in the Baltic countries. 
  This is far from a complete list of the remarks about 
Russia's "great-power chauvinism." What is the reason for these 
unfounded allegations? After the dissolution of the USSR, many 
Western political scientists were quick to conclude that Russia 
had lost the status of a great power forever, but their 
predictions were fated not to come true. Russia is a huge 
country with the right to its own voice in world politics and in 
the regions of its immediate concerns. After all, during periods 
of crisis, the United States can call the Middle East or Latin 
America a zone of U.S. strategic interests, and this arouses 
virtually no public objections. Russia's actions in neighboring 
countries, on the other hand, are invariably seen as 
"authoritarianism and chauvinism," even though interethnic 
conflicts along the perimeter of Russia's borders could have a 
direct effect on Russian security interests. 
  The unfounded criticism of Moscow was noticeably more 
vehement when centripetal tendencies took the foreground within 
the Commonwealth. This was due to more than just the need to 
restore severed economic ties. The unsuccessful attempts of our 
neighbors to join international structures and alliances have 
become increasingly apparent. There is not much reason to rely 
on economic aid from the West, and this is why all eyes are 
turning back to Russia. The results of the Ashgabat summit 
corroborated this. When participants elected the president of 
the Russian Federation to serve as CIS chairman for the next six 
months, they underscored Russia's leading role, including its 
leading position in the security sphere. 
  The goal of Russian foreign policy is the preservation of 
Russia's own national interests and national identity. We must 
secure strategic stability in the post-Soviet zone within the 
guidelines of accepted standards and rules of behavior in the 
democratic world. What does this have to do with "great-power" 
ambitions?

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Batuyev: "Privileges for Deputies of the </F>
State Duma"] 
  [Text] After becoming deputies many of the people's 
elect have quit their previous jobs. Therefore the question of 
the new labor compensation has become no less crucial for the 
"State Duma boys" than the question of their rights and 
authority. 
  It was decided by a majority of votes to make deputy's 
salaries equal to minister's salaries. But as it turned out not 
all of the voters knew how much a minister makes. In order to 
reveal the secret the speaker had to invite Ye. Gaydar to the 
podium. And when the speaker gave the figure of 157,000 rubles 
[R] certain deputies "got out their calculators" and decided to 
make adjustments. N. Parinov suggested making the salary of a 
deputy equal to two ministerial salaries, and A. Volkov 
evaluated the monthly work of a deputy at $3,000 (and that is 
about R5 million today). But modesty still won out. After all, 
increments still have to be added to that salary: 50 
percent--for the special nature and intensiveness of labor and 
40 percent...for length of service. (Although deputies of the 
first convocation were elected for only two years.) In general 
the labor compensation for a deputy at first will be almost 
R300,000. If parliamentary correspondents had had the right to 
vote at meetings of the State Duma I would have suggested 1.5 
ministerial salaries because the less a bureaucrat makes the 
more inclined he is to take bribes. 
  It was decided that each deputy would receive the same 
amount 
(with the exception of the speaker; he is to receive 40 percent 
more). And this being the case, the deputies cannot take their 
eyes off the fact that A. Chubays, A. Zaveryukha, E. Pamfilova, 
S. Shakhray, A. Shokhin, V. Danilov-Danilyan, and Yu. Kalmykov 
hold two seats at the same time: in the State Duma and in the 
Government. And, in keeping with the proclaimed equality 
(monetary), they handed down a "sentence" for the government 
minority: "Work in the Government of Russia shall be carried out 
on a nonreimbursable (unpaid) basis." 
  After the question of the deputies' credentials, which give 
them the right to immediate reception by leaders and other 
officials of organs of state power and local self-government and 
the question of the diplomatic passport, and after the solution 
to the money problem, naturally, there arose the question of 
office and dwelling space. According to the "Temporary 
Provisions" adopted by the State Duma on supporting the activity 
of deputies, each one is granted office space, and for those who 
have become "legal indigents"--dwelling space with furniture and 
a telephone although, true, without the right to privatize it. 
  For now the people from out of town have moved into hotels. 
All costs and also the cost of the travel of the deputy and his 
family to the capital are at state expense. In Moscow and Moscow 
Oblast the people's elect will travel on official transportation 
assigned to them personally, and in the outlying areas they will 
be given automotive transportation of the local administration, 
and in public transportation the deputy will arrange for his own 
travel using his credentials. Medical treatment of the deputy 
shall be provided at the government level. Vacations last 48 
working days. A deputy of the State Duma must be given all kinds 
of assistance in the local areas. In order to carry out his 
tasks successfully he may appoint up to five assistants and, 
naturally, they will not work for free (for five subordinates 
there will be two "State Duma" wages). 
  Before working in parliament even two weeks the deputies 
added to the "Temporary Provisions" a point about the 
termination of their authority. Upon termination of his 
authority the deputy shall move at state expense to the region 
(where he came from) and must receive work equal to his previous 
work. Following the logic of the temporary document, it would be 
possible for S. Shakhray and A. Shokhin upon termination of 
their deputy authority to return to their previous posts which 
have already been eliminated today--posts of deputy prime 
ministers. But the fate of the "Temporary Provisions" which give 
the aforementioned benefits will depend on the decision of the 
Government of the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, deputy chairman of </F>
the State Duma from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
faction, by Andrey Chaplygin; place and date not given: "A 
Member of the Team"] 
  [Text] We are continuing to become acquainted with 
new people in the Russian parliament. Aleksandr Vengerovskiy is 
the Deputy Chairman of the State Duma from the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] faction. So far he has not said much 
in parliament.... 
  Biographical note. Born in 1953 in Moscow. Russian, 
from a family of physicians, graduated MAI [Moscow Aviation 
Institute], faculty of radioelectronics of flight equipment. 
Worked in civil aviation. Served as an officer in the Main 
Administration of Military Space Science as a specialist in the 
area of computer equipment and systems for control of objects in 
space. At the height of his administrative career, already a 
"civilian," he became chief of the Main Administration of the 
State Committee for Computer Equipment and Information Science. 
He oversaw and organized the development of software in the 
USSR. He entered the CPSU while in the army. He did not tear up 
his communist party card but he terminated his 
membership.... 
  [Chaplygin] How do you evaluate the causes of the success of 
the LDPR in the recent elections? 
  [Vengerovskiy] In Rus, for example, there was always a legal 
opposition. Under the tsar it was the court jester. But the 
people always respected members of the opposition just as they 
did God's fools. Recall Vasiliy Vlazhenyy. Our people understood 
why we conduct agitation and propaganda in precisely this way 
and no other. We speak the same language, using the same sign 
system. 
  In the LDPR I handled purely specialized issues. I was 
deputy 
prime minister of the shadow cabinet of ministers, that is, I 
organized the intellectual team of the LDPR. 
  [Chaplygin] Are you obliged to follow the party line? And if 
you were faced with a choice of whom to obey, yourself or the 
party, which so far is associated with one person? 
  [Vengerovskiy] We have a party leader, we have a politburo, 
they are all the chairman's team. I am a member of the team of 
the party chairman, Zhirinovskiy. We hold the same positions and 
operate on the basis of the same argument-program of the LDPR. 
  [Chaplygin] You have come to parliament. What is your 
minimum 
program? 
  [Vengerovskiy] To work legislatively. The main aspects of my 
minimum program are to fight crime. The second is to change the 
economic course of reforms and foreign policy. And changes are 
taking place even now. For example, Kozyrev has begun to speak 
in a more pragmatic language. Moreover, we will defend the 
dignity of the Russian person regardless of where he may be. 
  The success we have achieved is not the end of the line for 
us. Our plans for the next two years call for including the LDPR 
in the country's political structure and supporting multiparty 
democracy. If someone rocks the fragile boat of our democracy, 
we shall try to stabilize the situation. They all understand 
that we are not fascists, we are a party of realists and 
centrists who are not indifferent to the fate of our homeland. 
  [Chaplygin] Maximum program? 
  [Vengerovskiy] We will go to the presidential elections 
taking advantage of the parliamentary possibilities. 
  [Chaplygin] And if it seems to members of the politburo of 
the LDPR that the party leader is too scandalous would it be 
possible to do without him in the future? 
  [Vengerovskiy] Nobody has been tempted to create a schism in 
the LDPR. Our strength lies in unity. We have one leader, there 
are no doubts here, it is Zhirinovskiy. 
  [Chaplygin] Statements on behalf of the LDPR abroad are 
alarming more than just politicians, they could evoke hostility 
toward Russians. 
  [Vengerovskiy] There are two types of civilizations: They 
are 
the spiritual-Russian and the Western-consumer civilization. 
Countries and people must determine for themselves which 
civilization they will belong to. I am convinced that the 
victory will go to spirituality in any case. And Zhirinovskiy is 
the leader in this struggle. He is the one now who is restoring 
the real parity that should exist in the world. When the balance 
of forces--the United States on the one hand and the USSR on the 
other--is disturbed, this could lead to the beginning of a third 
world war. Until we put an end to this situation and polarity 
appears, the world will be on the brink of great trials. 
Therefore the LDPR sets for itself the task of restoring our 
country's might. Only a mighty Russia and her mighty people will 
make it possible to provide stability throughout the world. But 
there are forces who do not want this. And we can designate them 
with a general term of "world forces behind the scene." 
  We have a strong intellectual group. We call it the "shadow 
cabinet of ministers." It is preparing many surprises for 
everyone.

<F P=106> [Interview with NTV President Igor Malashenko by ARGUMENTY I </F>
FAKTY correspondent Yuriy Zubtsov; place and date not given: 
"Television With Freedom?"] 
  [Text] The nonstate television company NTV began 
broadcasting on Channel 4 on 17 January. This marked the end of 
the prolonged conflict between NTV and Ostankino; the mutual 
reproaches, the struggle for the president to sign and then 
recall the edict on turning the channel over, and the backroom 
games will go down in the history of domestic television. Now 
the viewer can judge the work of the new television company: no 
longer just one program a day but 60 hours a week. ARGUMENTY I 
FAKTY correspondent Yuriy Zubtsov speaks with NTV president Igor 
Malashenko. 
  [Zubtsov] Igor Yevgenyevich, do you not perceive a certain 
irony of fate in your achievement of your desired goal? After 
all, in a certain sense you are obliged to Zhirinovskiy: It is 
thought that it was his victory that undermined the position of 
the main opponents of turning Channel 4 over to you--Vyacheslav 
Bragin and Mikhail Poltoranin. 
  [Malashenko] I would like to believe that even if the 
elections did have an influence, it was somehow different, that, 
possibly, some understanding emerged in the corridors of power: 
If one is to be in command of television and not relate to it as 
a sphere of professional activity, it will produce results 
opposite from those expected. And a professional television 
service, not one that is politically committed or subject to 
anyone's beck and call, can make a much greater contribution to 
the establishment of political stability than one that is 
prepared to scold and praise on order. But perhaps these are 
only my own daydreams and the real reasons were much more 
transparent. But still, I would like to believe this. 
  [Zubtsov] How do you arrange your cooperation with the 
programs left over from the previous Channel 4? 
  [Malashenko] At the present time all the main points have 
been agreed upon and we are just about to sign an agreement with 
the Association of Independent Television Producers, which 
includes above all ATV, Ren-TV, and ViD. According to its 
conditions we will acquire their output for six hours a week. 
They have distributed this time among themselves as follows: 
four hours for ATV and one hour each for Ren-TV and ViD. Let me 
emphasize that we are purchasing their programs in the same way 
as, for example, we buy artistic films in America. 
  [Zubtsov] And according to what principle do you select one 
program or another, say, "Vremechko" or "Sunday with Dmitiriy 
Dibrov"? Does their quality suit you? 
  [Malashenko] The viewer is the main one to evaluate the 
programs. I am the manager and it is my business to make 
financially justified decisions which coincide with the 
interests of the audience. Tastes are always subjective. But the 
viewer watches these programs and so they must be presented. 
Moreover, we absolutely do not want to cut the old off at the 
roots. On the contrary, a certain continuity is important to us. 
Channel 4 has its own viewer who is accustomed to certain 
programs and there is no point in rejecting them. 
  [Zubtsov] Even before the president's edict on turning the 
channel over to you there were rumors going around Ostankino to 
the effect that NTV was just about to gain a chunk of air time 
through the courts. Now there are similar conversations 
regarding the Russian channel with respect to "Russian 
universities." Does the same lot await them? 
  [Malashenko] There can be no question of any kind of 
expansion. But here is what we intend to do to expand the 
network reached by the channel. Today it encompasses more than 
40 million viewers and our investors are prepared to invest 
money in the creation of new transmitters and expansion of this 
network. I hope that by the end of the year this figure will 
increase. But this kind of expansion will hardly encroach on 
anyone's interests. 
  [Zubtsov] It is known that the sum Channel 4 was to have 
paid 
to the Ministry of Communications for air time last year was 
about 360 million rubles, 50 of which was for December alone. 
This year the rates for state television companies have been 
increased approximately 1.5-fold. And how much will NTV be 
paying? 
  [Malashenko] I cannot give you the precise figure, but these 
rates are much higher for us than they are for Ostankino. 
  [Zubtsov] Incidentally, during the period of the struggle 
for 
the channel many of your opponents were asserting that NTV 
investors were on the verge of financial ruin and that to obtain 
Channel 4 and make advertising prices much higher than they are 
in St. Petersburg was the only possibility of rectifying the 
situation. 
  [Malashenko] I would like very much for that to be the case, 
because if it were, we would soon become remarkably profitable. 
But for now we are doomed to bear colossal costs, and along with 
us--our investors as well. This is work for the long-range 
future. And as for advertising, the rates for it will indeed be 
high--relative to Russian prices and the prices of the former 
Channel 4. We have a purely market situation here. I never tire 
of repeating that state companies sell advertising time at 
reduced rates. The services of the Ministry of Communications, 
say, are paid for by the state to that same Ostankino, and this, 
incidentally, makes up 80 percent of Ostankino's budget. Nobody 
is paying for us. And while increasing the prices for 
advertising we understand that we can attract the advertiser 
only through the quality of our programs. Plus--through 
expansion of the broadcasting network. Although our prices are 
still, of course, lower than on Channel 1. 
  [Zubtsov] We have finally gotten around to the programs 
themselves. One cannot but admit that NTV has made an impressive 
start. What next? Do you plan to create new programs of your 
own? Tell us, incidentally, about Konstantin Erist's transfer to 
your team. 
  [Malashenko] I know nothing about Erist's transfer. We 
simply 
acquired for demonstration a large package of his "Matador" 
programs like, incidentally, many other popular programs from 
various years. The expansion of the team is proceeding but in 
the direction of the information service--a correspondents' 
network is being created throughout Russia and the first NTV 
correspondents' points are being opened up abroad. And we intend 
to produce only information programs, creating the first truly 
high-quality and professional information service on domestic 
TV. We shall buy everything else, which leaves a great deal of 
room for maneuvering. If the ratings drop for, say, some program 
on ATV or ViD--we will stop buying it and buy another one. 
Large-scale production of our own programs involve a 
dictatorship of the producer: we have invested money in the 
program and we have to put it on the air regardless of how 
interesting it has turned out to be. But for us everything is 
determined by the viewer's interest. We are waiting impatiently 
for the first ratings and sociological studies so that we can 
find out how the interest is distributed between domestic and 
foreign movies, old and new films, artistic programs and 
programs from the past. We will plan our subsequent work on this 
basis since we have the opportunity to do that.

<F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "Karelian Critical of Finnish </F>
Passivity"] 
  [Text] The Karelian Republic's foreign minister, Valeriy 
Shlyamin, is critical of the Finns for being ineffective and for 
just marking time regarding economic cooperation in nearby 
[Karelian] areas. Shlyamin stated these critical comments before 
the Finnish and Russian friendship organization leaders meeting 
in Petrozavodsk on Friday [21 January]. According to Shlyamin, 
U.S., German, and Austrian firms are about to take over the 
market in Karelia because of Finnish firms. In his view the 
Finns have not replied to Karelian proposals, and cooperation 
has not advanced over the past 18 months. Shlyamin sees one 
reason for this in that project initiatives of Finland and the 
Area Development Fund (KERA) have been inadequate. 
  The Finnish-Russian Friendship Society's chairman, Kaj 
Barlund, and its general secretary, Merja Hannus, visited 
Petrozavodsk on Friday. Barlund and the chairman of the Friends 
of Finland Society in Karelia, Aleksey Mironov, signed a 
protocol on cooperation. Barlund met on Friday also with 
Karelian Republic President Viktor Stepanov.

<F P=106> [Article by Rauni Vainamo: "East Border Becoming Rio Grande </F>
of the North"] 
  [Text] The border between Finland and Russia has been 
described as the most precipitous standard of living divider in 
the world. It reminds us of the border between the United States 
and Mexico. In that area, the difference in living standards has 
created lots of industry around the Rio Grande. 
  The border between Finland and Russia is quiet but showing 
signs of waking up. Three industrial villages are under 
construction along the border and a number of joint ventures are 
emerging. Trade across the border is taking place, utilizing 
various methods. 
  In the view of the experts, the eastern border, home of 
wolves, criminals and bears, should become an impressive facade 
towards Europe. The border should be utilized systematically, 
from Petsamo all the way to St. Petersburg and the Gulf of 
Vyborg. 
  "Currently, projects are arbitrarily started at the eastern 
border. For example, roads and industrial plants may be built in 
the wrong areas due to a lack of information," architect Risto 
Ali-Kovero, from Sunnittelukeskus Oy, noted with some concern. 
  Ali-Kovero has prepared a macronetwork plan for the border 
area, where the border line has been divided into the following 
planning areas: The Petsamo Corridor, The Sea to Sea Corridor, 
The Kainuu-Kostamus Corridor, The Karelian Gateway Area and The 
Kymi Border Circle. Also included are the Ystavyydenpuisto and 
the Saimaa-Ladoga Area. 
  "During the negotiations, Finland needs some trumps up its 
sleeves with which we can show that we are developing the border 
area in a controlled manner and that we are not creating an 
uninhabited backyard for the EU [European Union]," said 
Ali-Kohero. 
  If approval is granted for studies covering the entire 
borderline, more detailed planning, according to Ali-Kovero, 
will be initiated as a joint effort involving the Moscow 
building committee, Gostroi, the Government of the Republic of 
Karelia, and the Finnish Ministry of Environmental Affairs. 
<H5>  Village of Kostamus Largest </H5>
  Of all the ambitious industrial village projects, the 
largest 
is the Kospark Technology Park, which is located on the latitude 
of Kuhmo in Kostamus. 
  Business ventures are solicited to Kostamus not only from 
Scandinavia, but also from, among other countries, Germany. The 
plans are completed and the brochure has arrived from the 
printers. The investment costs in the industrial park, which 
spans about 15,000 square kilometers, are about 10 million 
dollars. The joint venture has already completed the frame of 
the main building of the mining industry collective, which is to 
be completed first. According to Research Director Hannu 
Linnainmaa, from Haka Oy, which is in charge of the project, it 
will include 2,000 square meters of space to be leased to 
businesses. 
  "The output is supposed to be environmentally safe, as we do 
not want to emit any pollutants into the environment. The border 
area is Finland's Rio Grande, but we have to be careful and not 
let inflation take the bottom out of the project. There are 
already products in Russia, the prices of which exceed world 
market prices," said Linnainmaa. 
  The intent is also to utilize high tech jointly with the 
universities. 
  The company has been founded as a closed private 
corporation, 
and its domicile is the City of Kostamus. 
<H5>  Work Done Close to Border </H5>
  The Kostamus Technology Park is located 40-50 km from the 
Finnish border. On the other hand, the Svetogorsk and Vartsila 
industrial villages are next to the border. The Varn industrial 
village, to be built on the Russian side of Vartsila, is part of 
the Karelian Gateway project, which was initiated by the 
Ministry of Environmental Affairs. 
  "Two areas in the village of Vartsila have been set aside 
for 
industrial and business facilities. Completed business spaces 
are also available in Sortavala. Janisjoki will also be utilized 
for tourism," said Kesalahti Business Ombudsman Kari Oksanen, 
who is in charge of the project. 
  The Varn Industrial Village is almost 30 hectares large, and 
the area is currently being mapped. The Russians own 57 percent 
of the venture, while the Finns own 43 percent. According to 
Oksanen, the minority share was a requirement for capital 
infusion from a fund recently established by the Russians. 
  In Svetogorsk, near Imatra, a Finnish-Russian business park 
is operating. The Russians own over 90 percent of the park. The 
size of the area is about 7 hectares. On the Finnish side, the 
partner in the joint venture is Suomen Imsveto. 
  "There are already two businesses on the Russian side of the 
business park. We provide them with a complete service, from the 
acquisition of raw materials to bookkeeping," said Antero 
Ikalainen, president of Suomen Imsveto Oy. 
  New border crossings lead to increased cooperation at the 
border. Another contributing factor is the special benefits 
granted Karelia through Russian development policies. The 
agreement between Finland and Russia regarding adjacent area 
cooperation has also helped to some extent. The Finnish state 
has appropriated a few million markkas for this cooperation. 
  The industrial villages, which are to be built in Russian 
Karelia, are also pleased by the expansion of the Developing 
Area Fund (KERA). A law proposal regarding this has been 
submitted to the Eduskunta. According to the proposal, KERA also 
should be able to fund start up and development costs for 
Finnish ventures when they are established abroad. 
  Financing could also be arranged for the purchase of shares 
in a company operating abroad. According to Pauli Tiainen, 
financing manager for KERA, next year's appropriation for this 
would be approximately 50 million markkas. 
<H5>  Village Retailer Showed Quadrangular Nail </H5>
  In village storekeeper Oiva Tikka's store there are boxes of 
nails imported from Russia. The hot galvanized iron nails are 
resulting in the establishment of an industrial village in the 
Russian part of Karelia. The village would benefit all of 
central Karelia. 
  In April of 1990, Tikka started to import nails from an iron 
plant located directly across the border. He, in turn, exported 
kitchen stoves with four burners to Russian Karelia. 
  "We met with the Russians for the first time in 1989. We met 
with Viktor Kamel, the manager of the iron plant, three times, 
after which we prepared a letter of intent, a business 
agreement, and also an agreement with a Finnish central firm, " 
said Tikka. 
  Tikka also acted as a product development consultant. He 
showed the plant manager a Finnish quadrangular nail and advised 
him in the production of more advanced hot galvanized nails. 
Tikka estimates that he has imported from the Russian part of 
Vartsila about 300 metric tons of iron nails, but the recession 
has had a dampening effect on demand. 
  Today, Viktor Kamel, the iron plant manager, is chairman of 
the Board of Directors for the Varn Technology Village. The five 
districts of Central Karelia participate in the project. They 
are, in addition to Vartsila, Kesalahti, Kitee, Tohmajarvi, and 
Raakkyla. Capital stock has been issued and the company has been 
registered in Petroskoi. 
  Kamel is concerned about the lack of decisions regarding the 
land areas in the industrial village. The instability of the 
political situation makes him weigh his words very carefully 
when he speaks in his office, which still is adorned with a 
picture of Lenin on the wall. 
  Viktor Kamel seems to have enough problems even within his 
plant. The plant employs 850 people, and, according to him, many 
of them are now not needed. "We don't want to let anybody go, 
and therefore we now need to find them other jobs. And these 
jobs should be produced by the joint venture, which started in 
May," said Kamel. 
  Kamel's wife, engineer Olga Kamel, manages a sewing shop, 
located in the area of the iron plant, which employs over a 
dozen women. Skila, from Joensuu, has outerwear for children 
sewn in the Russian part of Vartsila.

<F P=106> [Article by People's Deputy of Ukraine Yuriy Hnatkevych </F>
under the rubric "Point of View": "Certain Lessons From 
Elections in Russia, or Is the Zhirinovskiyization of the New 
Parliament a Threat to Us?"] 
  [Text] The results of elections in Russia have taught 
many lessons to Russia itself, to us in Ukraine, and to the 
entire concerned world. The origins and consequences of the 
success of Zhirinovskiyism will be analyzed for a long time to 
come. At present, we should be most interested in the aspects of 
the Russian experience that could manifest themselves during our 
election drama. Precisely a drama because it is hard to call 
elections anything but a dramatic mistake at a time of severe 
crisis and confusion in all strata of society and power circles. 
  It has now become clear that the split of reformist 
forces in Russia into several blocs, which most probably was a 
tactical move by Yeltsin aimed at taking away as many votes from 
the Communists as possible, scattered the platforms of reformers 
and diverted the attention and interest of the voters away from 
them. 
  The second mistake of Russian reformers followed from 
the first: Certain of their victory over the Communists, they 
turned the television and agitation campaign into something of 
an election show, into clowning, giving the opportunity to the 
one whom the reformers perceived as a clown to rivet the 
attention of citizens to the sweet and specific promises. It 
turns out that the clown was experienced: He knew well how to 
get the people to laugh and how to get them interested. 
  At present, there are two main sociopolitical ideologies in 
Ukraine--the national and the social. These ideologies do not 
exist in a completely autonomous manner, they penetrate each 
other. Hey, even the most obstinate nationalist wants to eat, 
and the most avowed socialist remembers what his nationality is. 
However, each of them lays a different emphasis on food and the 
nation. For some, "an independent Ukraine" is continuously lit 
up on the display of their consciousness, and for others, it is 
"I want to live well." Some are prepared to eat poorly or even 
die for a free Ukraine, whereas others may, under certain 
conditions, give up its independence. 
  In keeping with the above, we will have two main platforms, 
the left and the right, in our elections. The left consists 
mainly of the Socialists, the Communists, and the peasant party; 
the right--of the Republicans, the Democrats, the Rukh people, 
and so on. It is not known whether various parties of the left 
persuasion will dare to unite with the Communists or among 
themselves. Right-wing parties have announced the creation of 
the Standing Council (PDN) to coordinate candidates and efforts. 
  A third force, which we may conventionally call the "new 
democrats," has undoubtedly quite clearly emerged in Ukraine. 
These are for the most part former Communists who deliberately 
and clearly embarked on the path of our statehood and a market 
economy on the basis of private and joint-stock property. 
Nevertheless, for ethical and tactical considerations they do 
not go for an alliance with parties of a rightist orientation. 
This primarily concerns the Party of Democratic Revival of 
Ukraine and the Labor Congress of Ukraine. A considerable number 
of politicians, such as Ivan Plyushch, belong to this wing. 
  If we try to classify in principle those on whom the efforts 
of the parties will be targeted, we may distinguish two main 
types of voters. Politically aware individuals whom agitation 
does not influence at all because they have long known who to 
vote for are the first type. Those who are socially, or 
"sausage-wise," aware belong to the second type. They voted in 
favor of the independence of Ukraine mainly because they 
believed in a better life under conditions of independence. They 
have now been deeply disappointed. 
  It is hard to say precisely what the number of voters of 
this 
type is on the whole or in individual regions. However, we may 
already say two things with certainty: Such voters are the 
majority, and their political culture and competency are a 
veritable "black box," a mixture of "mush" of various kinds. 
These people are desperate. They are worn out, and they do not 
trust anyone anymore. At present, they are saying indignantly 
while standing in lines that they will not turn out to vote. If 
they do turn out, who will they vote for? Probably there will be 
no votes for the Communists and Socialists if they do not 
disguise themselves. They carry around baggage that is too 
infamous. As far as the national-democrats are concerned, a 
considerable proportion of the "sausage-minded" treat them with 
aggressive fury. They say that, first, under the democrats 
everything has fallen apart and worsened. Second, in the eyes of 
the "sausage-minded," the democrats have turned out to be the 
same thieves as the partocrats. "They are all the same"--such is 
the motto of the lines in stores. 
  The truth about the allocation of apartments to some 
deputies 
and the purchase of cars shortly before prices for them were 
raised is intertwined with bizarre gossip. Attempts to convince 
the people that Larysa Skoryk did not buy three cars and that 
she does not have a four-floor dacha bring nothing but sneers. 
  Recently I learned that parquet floors have been laid in the 
building at Pryrichna Street where some deputies live and that 
there is even a cafeteria there to which sugar, butter, meat, 
and other foodstuffs are delivered, and that prices in the 
cafeterias and the canteen of the Supreme Council are one-third 
of what they are in the stores. If only these people knew that 
not only are the parquet floors and the cafeteria absent but 
that the deputies rarely manage to get even sugar and butter 
distributed through lists drawn up by housing maintenance 
offices. Prices in the cafeterias of the Supreme Council are at 
restaurant levels, and for this reason there are always few 
people there. 
  On one occasion I ventured to identify myself as a deputy 
while in line for milk; in response I heard a unanimous roar of 
laughter. A man with a clearly rural background stated: "He 
would not be standing here if he were a deputy. What a joker!" 
[rendered in Russian in the original] He told a story about the 
deputies recently having "started a fight among themselves in 
the Supreme Council store." [rendered in Russian in the 
original] There is no such store. So I understood a few truths. 
First: Lies of this kind can only be circulated in a purposeful, 
thought-out, and planned manner, with a knowledge of the 
mentality of the citizens. Second: The stream of "information" 
of this kind will greatly increase as the elections draw nearer. 
  There is no doubt that few of the current deputies will 
succeed in breaking through to the new Supreme Council. The 
waiting line for milk will not vote for the current democratic 
deputies. The line is looking for those who are guilty. It may 
even deal with them the way it dealt with the Tsar's family, 
capitalists, well-to-do peasants, and enemies of the people. The 
line is listening to a third force, which will promise them firm 
order. The line does not wish to know anything about the 
platforms of blocs. The line awaits specific promises for 
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and those making the 
promises will not be long in coming. 
  They will promise to some to do away with lines, to some--to 
pay back the money in saving banks, to others--to set high 
salaries, to still others--to close down stands and force 
vendors to go work at plants, and to yet others they will 
promise a second state language, and they will promise everyone 
together that they will be financially disinterested, stop trips 
abroad, and vanquish the mafia. And if here and there they also 
foster hopes for a return to the ruble zone.... Thus, the step 
of the Zhirinovskiys is already heard. The social protest of the 
waiting lines is good enough soil for them. An alliance between 
the Zhirinovskiys of Russia and Ukraine may become a reality, 
too. A powerful opposition front should also become a reality, 
which, proceeding from the experience of elections in Russia, 
will call for a number of prerequisites. 
  First. The number of criteria for resolving the 
issue of who among the deputies is "ours" or "not ours" should 
be reduced. Under certain conditions, the national-democrats 
should give support to all who advocate independence, even the 
Socialists. The Socialists should do the same. After all, the 
threat of a dictatorship is real. The wisdom of the people can 
hardly be relied upon. The people are wise, but it was precisely 
the people who brought Hitler to power in a constitutional 
manner; the people who voted for Stalin for almost 30 years; the 
people who rose up from their seats and clapped their hands in 
the era of "tits-ema-tits" [phonetic approximation of Brezhnev's 
way of pronouncing the word "systematic"], when yet another 
leader kept on talking about the general crisis of capitalism. 
Contenders for leaders are now numerous, and the election law 
makes it possible for virtually everyone to "stick out." 
  Second. Preelection agitation should be 
exhaustive. Democracy is not just a choice, it is a choice in an 
environment of sufficient information. Will our parties be able 
to give people clear-cut promises substantiated in their words 
instead of hard-to-understand platforms? People believe promises 
rather than theories. 
  As far as the democrats are concerned, their success will 
depend on whether they will be able to debunk three myths: 1) 
the myth that "independence is to blame for everything"; 2) the 
myth that "the democrats are to blame" for the economic 
collapse; 3) the myth that "they (i.e., the democrats) sold out 
for cars and low cafeteria prices." The democrats do not have 
much time--one month per myth.... 
  From the author: I request that the honorarium be 
transferred to the VECHIRNIY KYYIV Fund.

<F P=106> [Article by NEZAVISIMOST columnist Yanina Sokolovskaya: "We </F>
Are Reaching Our Boiling Point--Ukraine May Be Overwhelmed 18 
January by an Unprecedented Strike"] 
  [Text] In a single instant, miners, dock workers, railroad 
workers, machinists, textile workers, air traffic controllers, 
and airline pilots flying foreign and domestic routes will cease 
work, city transportation will come to a halt... This is the 
decision made in a session of the executive committee of the 
association Free Trade Unions of Ukraine. The main demand of the 
All-Ukraine strike is the resignation of the Cabinet of 
Ministers and formation of a new government headed by Volodymyr 
Lanovyy, who is supposed to obtain all possible authority over 
the period prior to the elections and set about the conduct of 
economic reform. Resignation of the president is not yet a 
demand--in the opinion of the trade unions, "his task is not to 
interfere." 
  Until such time as these demands are met, Ukraine will 
constitute an appendage and will remain not only without coal, 
but without means of transportation and communications with the 
outside world as well. The scope of losses from such a strike of 
indefinite duration would be difficult to predict. 
  But we know for certain that the epicenter of the impending 
events will not be Donbass, but rather Kiev, where several 
large-scale enterprises will be the first to go on strike. 
Others will immediately follow--in all regions. In the opinion 
of Free Trade Unions, the "higher authorities" will better feel 
the impact of a strike begun in the capital than ordinary miners. 
  Lenin Forge and other industrial "monsters" in the capital 
have already repeatedly declared their desire to take part. 
  "Ukraine is reaching its boiling point"--noted Aleksandr 
Mril, leader of the Independent Trade Union of Miners. "Just one 
more small upheaval and the country will not survive to election 
time. If the trade unions do not today mount a strike, extremist 
forces will take advantage of the disarray of the masses--a 
situation fraught with the prospect of civil war." 
  But right now, independent trade union forces are looking at 
a specific common enemy: "the existing authority, under which 
people cannot live normally." 
  Meanwhile, even the obsolete Cabinet of Ministers has been 
granted a stay of execution of the trade union sentence and been 
given the opportunity to remain in their long-occupied seats, if 
they bring salaries into conformance with price increases in the 
course of a month and introduce a mechanism of anticipatory 
compensation. This is mentioned in the decree of the executive 
committee of Free Trade Unions which was distributed to the 
Supreme Council, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the president. 
  However, the workers do not believe that that which has 
remained undone over two years can be realized over the course 
of one month. Therefore, they are using the time remaining prior 
to 18 January to coordinate strike activities. Talks have been 
held with Volodymyr Lanovyy as well, whose candidacy for the 
position of prime minister elicits no objection from the 
population majority, it has become clear, or from most parties 
and movements, which have long discussed the need for 
professional economic leadership of the country. As the current 
leader of the Center for Market Reforms stated, he "will agree 
to accept the responsibility entrusted, taking into account the 
adversity of the economic situation in the country," and will 
take the first steps on a state level towards extricating the 
country out of crisis and stabilizing the socioeconomic 
situation. 
  In the opinion of the trade unions, this will prevent a 
"witch hunt" from taking place in Ukraine and will give the 
country a period of respite and the opportunity to survive until 
the elections. But here we recall information not as yet refuted 
by anyone: In the event of social conflicts in Ukraine, a state 
of emergency will be introduced and the elections will be 
postponed; a ban will be placed on political parties and 
movements, and other measures of a military nature will be 
enacted. A Ukraine-wide strike of indefinite duration more than 
constitutes suitable cause for a "state of emergency." 
  "Social conflicts in January-February may be used by the 
'higher authorities' as a pretext for introducing an 
illegitimate regime and government and prolonging the authority 
of the president. This will lead the country into a final 
impasse," V. Lanovyy believes. "The impending crisis has to 
yield positive results, for example--a revision of economic 
policy and the reactionary law on elections." 
  But then, in the opinion of trade union leaders, the "higher 
authorities" will be able only to proclaim a state of 
emergency-- they will not have the power to implement it. And if 
this does take place, people will just become further convinced 
of the lengths to which their present leaders will go. And in 
that case, the year 1994 in our country will be covered with the 
banner of strike.

Already Ringing Out Among Miners of Ukraine"] 
  [Text] Lugansk--At the end of last September seven miners 
of the Zolotoye mining administration went down their last 
dead-end passage. Methane mixed with coal dust that had burst 
into one of the deep workings raged more terribly than a flame 
thrower through the drift at a depth of about 700 meters. Once 
again the coal was paid for with human lives. Once again the 
president of Ukraine conveyed his condolences to the families of 
the deceased. Once again because it was on this same land in the 
Donbass that an even more terrible tragedy occurred a little 
more than a year ago. At the Sukhodolskaya-Vostochnaya mine near 
Krasnodon--there was a number of smaller accidents. Quite 
recently there was a blast furnace explosion in 
Dneprodzerzhinsk. There were victims and there were burials. 
  Completely by accident, of course, the death of the miners 
at 
Zolotoye coincided with the peak of the political struggle in 
Ukraine and Russia. The struggle around power and for power. 
Above and below. In the capitals and in the provinces. The 
mining village of Zolotoye, covered with coal dust, is in the 
provinces. You cannot get any farther out. And the mining 
administration here, a part of the Pervomayskugol association, 
of course, does not make much difference either economically or, 
certainly, politically. But the mining city of Pervomaysk, which 
has administrative jurisdiction over Zolotoye, occupies quite a 
prominent place on the political map of Ukraine. In the red hot 
sociopolitical environment poorly insulated wires cause sparks 
here time after time. 
  The thing is that while parliament and the president of 
Ukraine are going back and forth over the referendum on 
confidence in themselves and the decision as to whether or not 
it would be worthwhile to reelect local authorities at the same 
time, in Pervomaysk there was no doubt about the latter. Because 
in the middle of the summer, driven by the desperate leaders of 
the city's Independent Trade Union of Miners (NPG), Yuriy 
Arkhipchuk and Sergey Galyautdinov, the striking miners simply 
forced the entire body of deputies to put their mandates on the 
table. True, the ispolkom [executive committee] remained, but 
without the city council. It is difficult to say whether the 
city's residents were seriously affected by their absence but 
new--early--elections to the presidium of the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine were scheduled--for 26 September. That is, the day on 
which the now revoked referendum was to be held. The situation 
with the reelection of city deputies in Pervomaysk should have 
revealed many tendencies. 
  The results of the political experiment, which is unique to 
Ukraine, provide abundant food for thought. Because early 
elections in this rebellious city (where regularly, once every 
half year, after noisy public hunger strikes and other protest 
actions the local bureaucratic idols are overthrown and where, 
one might say, the mood is determined by their own provincial 
Walesas, where the very radical NPG wields an extremely great 
deal of influence) actually flopped--of the 120 candidates from 
the "first round" only 29 became deputies. Of the 35 nominated 
by the NPG--only three. Of the eight representatives of 
Rukh--not a single one. In the 84 electoral districts the 
elections in general were declared void and few more than 
one-fourth of the voters appeared at the precincts. 
  Whatever you may say, Russia and Ukraine are different 
countries. When the leader of one abolishes his parliament and 
by an arbitrary decision schedules elections for a new one, the 
leader of the other persuades the members of parliament to 
personally schedule their own solemn internment. And if in the 
former case there appears a band of malcontents and they start 
shooting, in the latter the process takes place fairly 
peacefully and it is as though everyone is even slightly 
satisfied. Or they give that appearance. 
  Except, perhaps, the miners, who are not satisfied and they 
do not give that appearance. Beginning in 1989 they have been 
persistently throwing a wrench into the works first of the Union 
and now of the sovereign leaders, endlessly complicating with 
their unpredictable steps the political schemes concocted by 
supreme and local authorities, the coal "generals," and all 
kinds of parties and movements there. 
  On the first Monday in October, when the gunfire had 
subsided 
and the president of Ukraine was hastening to analyze what had 
happened in the neighboring state, in remote provincial Lugansk 
there was a meeting of the regional council of strike committees 
of Donbass (RSSKD). The meeting, as always, was loud, 
tension-filled, and discordant. But the people, who had come 
from all corners of the coal region, firmly agreed on one thing: 
Their intention to hold early elections to parliament, the local 
councils, and the presidency. They would continue to gather 
signatures for holding a referendum on the resignation of the 
leaders of Ukraine, insisting on fulfillment of all points of 
the protocol signed in conjunction with the government on 17-18 
June. In the meeting of the RSSKD one could feel in the air a 
kind of actually revolutionary impatience, from which it 
followed that those in attendance had finally become sick and 
tired of exchanging "papers" with the powers that be, and 
somehow accidentally it came out that the miners were being 
provoked to rebel, that the Moscow version of events could quite 
possibly be repeated here in the east of Ukraine. And it must be 
admitted that the most hot-headed of "meeting regulars" spoke of 
weapons (incidentally, this was not the first time). They spoke 
during the hours when the barrels of rifles had not even cooled 
off in neighboring Russia, whose border is just a stone's throw 
away from here. 
  The chairman of the coordinating council of worker 
committees 
of Lugansk Oblast, Stepan Savyuk, in a conversation with me 
later fervently confirmed: "These `to-arms' attitudes are 
actually extremely widespread among miners. It would seem that 
the miners' reserve of patience has been completely exhausted." 
  The worker movement in Ukraine is the largest and best 
organized. At its base, as was expressed earlier, is the miner 
community, who are accustomed to obeying their superiors, have 
largely grown up under orders from brigade leaders, are 
relatively more disciplined in their work and in rallies, and 
react sharply to deception and injustice. And this community has 
not become a clearly formed political force in recent years and 
has not finally determined its party orientation. It would even 
be more correct to say that it finds party affiliation 
emphatically alien and shuns it. At least that has been the case 
up to this point. The most intelligent of the leaders, having 
recognized the futility of purely strike methods of the workers' 
struggle for their rights and a decent existence, are trying to 
direct things into a civilized channel--toward the creation of a 
party. So far, incidentally, unsuccessfully. 
  During the summer, when the miners who went out onto the 
squares of the cities of the Donbass were joined by many branch 
trade unions and trade union federations, for a moment it seemed 
that a Ukrainian "Solidarity" was being born. But in just a 
couple of weeks it was understood that the miners led by the 
former nomenklatura would drop out of the bloc that was being 
formed. And that is what happened. After the termination of the 
campaign for gathering signatures for holding the referendum, 
the miners again went one on one against the authorities--and 
alone amongst themselves. It is not out of place, however, to 
note that while defending the "rights of all workers," the 
miners again accepted the Greek gifts from the government in the 
form of higher wages, tax benefits, abolition of fines for 
exceeding the consumption funds at enterprises... And the rest 
of the population was given what they had before--high 
inflation, rapid growth of prices and...their deep antipathy 
toward the miners grew stronger. 
  Many politicians are still both secretly and openly seeking 
friendship, if only temporary, with the miner movement. And, 
probably, also the authorities--directly or through certain 
third parties. Many people are making reference to the movement 
and many are proposing alliances. The directors' lobby is also 
trying to squeeze its melody out of this instrument. For 
everyone understands that this is the force that will (as has 
happened before) decide the outcome of the elections in the east 
and hence also the fate of Ukraine as a whole. It is impossible 
to cast this reality aside. Can they utilize it? Or, taking into 
account the movement's amorphous quality, cast it aside anyway? 
It is all a matter of where and how the comma is placed. 
  It would seem, however, that neither the current president 
nor the parliament nor the government will succeed in winning 
the sympathies of the miners under any circumstances. The have 
gone too far in the direction of mutual hostility. 
  Parties which are dwarf-like in numbers and influence do not 
stand much chance of utilizing the miners either, although 
attempts are being made. In its memorandum the Lugansk branch of 
the Ukrainian Republican Party, for example, even considered it 
possible to turn to "strike committees as the only really 
organized force in the region." 
  The Liberal Party which, judging from many indications, is 
financed by powerful commercial structures, is acting more 
appropriately. The Liberals have even contrived to conclude an 
agreement for mutual cooperation with the Donetsk strike 
committee. 
  What and who are left? Strange as it may be, the communists 
and socialists, who as far back as two years ago, promised to 
return to power "on a wave of popular dissatisfaction." The 
crest of the wave is higher than ever before, and these parties 
are gradually racking up points. Sociologists have recorded an 
appreciable growth of sympathies for communists and socialists 
who (together) are prepared to hand over the votes of almost 
one-fourth of the voters in the elections. The Communist Party 
of Ukraine enjoys solid authority from every fifth one of 
the...miners who were questioned. If one adds that more than 40 
percent of the voters gave a positive assessment to the summer 
strikes in the Donbass and the strong-arm methods of struggle, 
and that among miners they make up almost three-fourths, it is 
clear as can be: The fuel mixture is practically ready. It is 
not difficult to guess what can happen when the "only real 
force" joins with the most disciplined and structured of the 
parties we know about. Even the Bolsheviks in the "to cast aside 
impossible to use" formula places the punctuation marks 
according to all the rules of revolutionary punctuation.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmytro Konovalov and Vyacheslav Pikhovshek, of </F>
"Vybir": "The Nomenklatura's Yardstick Has Laid Foreign Policy 
in a Procrustean Bed"] 
  [Text] The nomenklatura, for which independence has turned 
out to be only an additional way to grow rich, has also lost 
foreign policy. The reasons for this do not at all lie in the 
area of "enemy encirclement" or "Russian policy," but only in 
the fact that long term thinking is in general not 
characteristic of the "party of the government"--the principle 
of "the day before yesterday" is continuing is victorious 
existence. 
  On the anniversary of independence, many democratic 
politicians indicated only one unconditional achievement of 
Kravchuk's foreign policy--Ukraine is recognized by 140 states. 
In the most serious analysis even this service seems quite 
dubious, in as much as we owe recognitions first of all to the 
pressure of the diasporas which are influential in Canada and 
Australia, to which were added pro-Ukrainian inclined circles in 
other states. 
  The reason for the failure of the foreign policy of Ukraine 
is the fact that it came after events, since the classic 
position of the bureaucracy always won: do not do anything 
without instructions from above, because any initiative could be 
punished. The orientation of Ukraine toward cooperation with 
Iran and Slovakia, which do not enjoy the reputations of 
democracies in the world, and with China ("This state is a 
priority economic partner for Ukraine"--Ivan Plyushch), where 
dissidents are still suppressed, leads one to think about the 
desire of the nomenklatura to unite with those similar to it. It 
is hard to say whether the shooting of students in Tienanmen 
Square is an example for anyone from the "party of the 
government." 
  Those who are responsible for Ukrainian foreign policy can 
be 
understood when they say that there are quite a few objective 
reasons for the failures. Ukrainian nuclear armament became a 
thorn in the paw of Ukrainian diplomacy. The entire policy of 
the West toward Ukraine focused on it. Russia, having survived 
the brief shock after the separation of Ukraine from "forever 
together," was able to triple its efforts on the diplomatic 
front, and to reach the point that in the West the nuclear 
Ukraine came to be seen as dangerous. The embassies of Russia, 
which have in individual states staffs of up to 1,000, not 
counting the employees of Aeroflot, naval representatives, and 
the offices of trading organizations, easily won the struggle 
for influence with the few Ukrainian ambassadors, many of whom, 
moreover, did not have experience gained by years of diplomatic 
work. 
  It is not necessary to accept the position of the West, but 
it is worthwhile understanding it. Despite everything, 
bipolarity made possible life in a relatively stable world, 
where professionals opposed professionals, and intelligence 
agencies, "hot lines," and reciprocal plans for military action, 
functioned. In a world in which there are few nuclear countries, 
the risk of nuclear conflict was lessened, and this means that 
the likelihood of world war decreased. This simple and logical 
thesis directs all movements of the West which to some seem 
chaotic. 
  However, the objective reasons which cause the difficulties 
of Ukrainian foreign policy, do not justify the serious mistakes 
of the Ukrainian leadership. The answer to the question of what 
could be an effective foreign policy for Ukraine, has to be 
sought not in the sphere of any sorts of "geopolitical 
interests," which sometimes take on a distorted form of 
"Ukrainian messianism" and a "special path" for Ukraine, but in 
the sphere of internal policy. The fact that the office of the 
President on questions of foreign policy presents the positions 
of western countries toward Ukraine as indifferentiatedly 
hostile, comes from the same concept of the policy of the 
nomenklatura as does the credit and financial regulation of 
prices. The humanitarian aid of Germany and the USA is 
"forgotten;" everything is forgotten which does not fit into the 
nomenklatura's concept of "Ukraine and a hostile world." The 
influence of Russia on the formulation of the policy of the West 
is exaggerated to the maximum, up to the point that the myth has 
been created about coordinated pressure of the USA and the 
Russian Federation in the matter of Ukrainian nuclear arms. By 
all this, together with other "arguments," the nomenklatura has 
one goal: to prove that the Ukrainian people must tighten its 
belt and... suffer. 
  The nomenklatura is also still playing the card of the 
Ukrainian diaspora, which from idealistic considerations is 
paying for embassies, very often without getting any financial 
accountings about what its money is being spent on. These people 
sincerely believe that they are helping the first popularly 
elected President to build the state. However, in the diaspora 
circles, which eagerly receive guests from Ukraine and before 
which is chanted without logic, "Our President is our chief," 
they are also beginning to understand: help for the nomenklatura 
is not the best use of the money which they have earned by their 
labors. In the West, another type of sympathizers for Ukraine 
has appeared; those who, when independence was won, got 
positions in the Ministries of Defense, Trade, Foreign Affairs, 
Intelligence, and in embassies. The question of the independence 
of Ukraine is for them a question of protecting their jobs. 
  The problem of Ukraine's nuclear capacity would 
automatically 
be pushed to the back burner if the Ukrainian government began a 
policy of economic reforms. The introduction of reforms would 
permit us to attract the funds of western investors for 
participation in the development of effective production; and 
then immediately the corresponding lobbies would be formed in 
western governments. It would require a change of state policy 
toward Ukraine just from mercantile considerations, in order to 
protect their own money. 
  The question of political stabilization in Ukraine could be 
solved immediately by several paths. Among these are both the 
election of new structures of government on democratic 
principles, and the establishment of a dictatorship as a result 
of a civil war or disorders. In the second case, the government, 
most probably, would remain in the hands of the same leading 
structures and persons, as can be found at the helm today. In 
the eyes of the West, they have shown their bankruptcy as 
leaders, having passed in the Supreme Council an undemocratic 
law on elections, despite all the warnings of many western 
experts and the proposal of the Council of Europe. 
  Carrying out democratic elections in Ukraine at least will 
show the West who really expresses the will of the people, and 
will open, as is shown there, the way to economic reform. As 
they evaluate the process of election of a new parliament, much 
will depend on the international position toward Ukraine and the 
possibility of further integration into the world community. 
Beyond this, as we choose our future in March, the whole world 
will see that it has become much smaller since the fall of the 
iron curtain.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Volodymyrovich Datsyuk, procurator </F>
general of Ukraine, by Natalya Svichkolop: "Candid Discussion. 
Whom God Chooses, He Also Tests"] 
  [Text] It is not often that fate blesses us with 
encounters that provide sufficient occasion for useful 
reflection. But if it stares you in the face and offers 
communication with a person who listens to the voice of 
conscience--the voice of God--in his soul, it would be a sin not 
to share what you have heard. 
  It might seem absurd to some, who might wonder why 
speak with General Procurator of Ukraine Vladislav 
Volodymyrovich Datsyuk not simply about the fight against crime 
but about the real threat of self-destruction of world 
civilization or to recall the Delphic gods who commanded: Look 
inside yourself, get to know yourself, concentrate on yourself, 
for "you are being betrayed, your own selves are being stolen 
from you." Another person might rightfully wonder what crime and 
market egoism have in common. But this very market mechanism has 
doomed about 80 percent of the population of the planet to 
poverty and degradation! And what should be the relations among 
people and between society and nature? How do we find that which 
did not exist but which was felt and anticipated by humanist 
thinkers of mankind, from Socrates and Christ to Vernadskiy, 
Tolstoy, and Berdyayev? What are these incentives that preclude 
violence and preserve Life? Why do people sometimes send their 
conscience to the brothels but at the same time contrive to 
preserve an external appearance of decency? 
  This conversation turned out to be about ailments of 
the soul, although it began with a very trivial question, which 
is bothering everyone: What is the Procuracy up to today? 
  "The same things that our state and people are up to--being 
worried about problems, disturbances, and legal violations that 
have developed in Ukraine," Vladislav Volodymyrovich answered. 
"The main goal we face is to reorient the work of the Procuracy 
in such a way that our supervision focuses specifically on those 
violations that are leading us into chaos--the lack of 
discipline and disregard for the law." 
  [Svichkolop] What disturbs the procurator general most of 
all 
now? 
  [Datsyuk] The situation in which we have all ended up. I 
would call it a collapse. You will agree that today all 
bureaucrats have found themselves in the position of temporary 
workers in our state. Hence also the direction of their actions, 
and there is one main problem: How to survive when your bags are 
packed? The solution they have chosen is this: to create in some 
places structures that are illegal or, within the framework of 
the law itself, structures that not only help the collective to 
stay afloat, but also help the state bureaucrat himself or the 
economic worker to hold a more or less secure position. We have 
acted irrationally and destroyed the political, economic, and 
legal system all at once, completely forgetting about the 
concept of spirituality and the terrible problems of the 
ecology. We have thrown ourselves into the market. We have 
jacked up prices, motivated by the idea that we need to keep up 
with world prices. But nobody has explained to us why we need 
them. Neither you nor I nor any other rank-and-file worker needs 
them. And what has happened? This has led some people to this 
idea: "Why put on masks and break open cash registers when 
everything can be done much more simply; we can take money from 
the bank with interest (even if it is usurious, it is still 
advantageous), buy goods today, and in a month or even two weeks 
(thanks to inflation), there will be another two- to-threefold 
price increase, and the millions we have spent will turn into 
billions. What do the state and the people gain from such 
tricks? Nothing. And there are all kinds of wheeler-dealers like 
this around now. I, the procurator general, do not know how many 
commercial structures we have in the country. According to 
certain figures, there are 106,000; according to 
others--300,000. They are cropping up like mushrooms after a 
rain. Only 5-6 percent of them produce anything. What would seem 
to be a good idea enabling them to produce goods for the 
consumer upon inspection turns out to be simply speculation 
legalized by the state. The upstart businessmen understand that 
as long as the water has been muddied, it is possible to scrape 
together capital for a year or two, turn it into dollars because 
karbovantsy are worth nothing, and, as they say, cover all the 
angles. 
  Yes, but a question arises. Has anybody registered these 
commercial structures, familiarized themselves with the 
regulations of the joint venture, and found out who would be 
included in it? They include, as a rule, the manager and his 
wife or daughter, his son, the father of his son-in-law or 
"cohort," and the person who handles the registration imposes 
his own conditions: "I want to work here too." And what do we 
have? A situation that has no limit. That is all. The circle is 
closed. Nobody is to blame. They do their illegal business with 
the help of the power structures, which are participating in it 
directly. And it turns out that 5 percent, excuse me, are eating 
up the national income today, while 95 percent have been cast 
into poverty, they have no future. 
  But now answer me this: Was it really possible to introduce 
a 
national currency without having a food reserve, a gold reserve, 
a reserve of raw material? Was it really possible to get away 
from the solid monetary unit--the ruble? 
  But that is one aspect. Look what has happened in parallel. 
In 1991 the Supreme Council adopted the Law on the Procuracy. 
They thought they would construct a rule-of-law state out of 
good intentions and limit the functions of the Procuracy in it. 
There was no need to worry about commercial structures or 
banking or credit-financial affairs, and people's 
complaints--there was no need to worry about them, either; let 
them go to court. 
  [Svichkolop] That is, in practice the Procuracy was deprived 
of its supervisory functions. 
  [Datsyuk] Yes. I agree that the functions of the Procuracy 
could have been narrowed, but at a time when we have order in 
the state, when the citizen is protected not only by the law but 
also materially and socially. But where can a person go today? 
To whom can that pensioner from the village complain about the 
fact that the buses are not running, that he has not received 
his pension since November, and also that that pension is only 
enough for a couple of pieces of bread? They say, let him go to 
court. But where will you find a lawyer, and his services have 
to be paid for as well. It used to be that a person could go to 
the procurator, and he would pick up the phone, call the 
manager, and sometimes he could even resolve the whole matter on 
the telephone. 
  Now when the membership of the new board of the Procuracy 
was 
being formed, we immediately oriented our workers so that they 
would turn in the direction of the people. Whether the issue 
comes under your jurisdiction or not, receive the person, listen 
to him, and if you cannot help, at least give him advice. 
  And the second thing we have worked on is expansion of the 
framework of procuratorial supervision. And another major thing 
is that for two years nobody worked on coordinating the fight 
against crime. And the consequences of this deliberate unconcern 
have not failed to make themselves felt. Incidentally, the 
function of coordinating law enforcement organs was removed from 
the Procuracy by that same law of 1991. With a crisis of power, 
a growth of crime is natural, and here the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, the Procuracy, the Ukrainian Security Service, and the 
Supreme Court acted independently, each ignoring the others. 
They created a coordinating council for fighting crime under the 
president. But should the head of state really worry about 
thefts, muggings, or highway accidents? 
  [Svichkolop] Is the Procuracy today still deprived of all 
the 
functions you named as it was before? 
  [Datsyuk] No. They have been restored. We appealed to the 
Supreme Council, and they supported us. 
  But the time has passed. Now there is a possibility of 
joining together with militia workers, the courts, and Ukrainian 
Security Service workers, and deciding what to do. We just have 
to get everyone together. 
  [Svichkolop] Getting rid of the pain that is tormenting our 
society at the given moment certainly does not mean that its 
health will improve for good, even if its general condition does 
improve. Do you agree? 
  [Datsyuk] Perhaps. But what we have today is terrible. 
Moreover, I don't believe that we will be able to essentially 
rectify the situation in the next year or two. Even now we are 
investigating dozens of criminal cases against big-time crooks, 
managers, ministries, departments, and WARNING: Army structures. 
But we must not forget that we are working largely with 
organized crime, which is well armed. 
  Therefore comes the next thing I would like to discuss: We 
must adopt a law on arming decent, law-abiding citizens. This 
would not apply to drunkards, schizophrenics, or individuals 
with a record of convictions. Before breaking down the door to 
your apartment, the criminal should at least think about the 
fact that he might get a bullet in the forehead. But now we have 
complete vulnerability of some people and virtual impunity of 
others. Moreover, it has become fashionable to look across the 
ocean. But America has a completely different society, a 
different concept of obeying the law, and a different legal 
defense system. But we rush to defend the accused. Yes, his 
rights must be observed, but within the framework of the law. 
But why have we forgotten that there is another side--the 
victims and their close relatives. How do they feel about the 
fact that the criminal goes free? And there are hundreds of 
thousands of them who are free today! The state must first 
protect the victim, compensating him for both material and moral 
costs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Gavrilovich Belyavskiy, doctor of </F>
medical sciences and chairman of Drug Control Committee of 
Ukrainian Ministry of Health, by Yuriy Vilenskiy; date and place 
not given: "There Will Be Drugs in Ukraine, but They Will Be 
Under Control"] 
  [Text] The drug onslaught, which is aimed primarily 
at the younger generation, has become a reality, and Ukraine's 
barriers on the fatal path have not been reliable enough to 
date. Now a subdivision of exceptional importance to public 
health is taking action. PRAVDA UKRAINY interviewed Chairman 
V.G. Belyavskiy of the Drug Control Committee of the Ukrainian 
Ministry of Health, doctor of medical sciences. We will begin 
with a few words about him. He is a well-known toxicologist and 
he heads a laboratory in the Scientific Research Institute of 
Pharmacology and Toxicology, where he has been working for 25 
years. 
  [Vilenskiy] Vladimir Gavrilovich, what is the moral and 
legal 
platform of the committee you head? 
  [Belyavskiy] The committee was established in accordance 
with 
the decision of the Ukrainian National Security Council "On the 
Status of the Struggle Against the Drug Traffic in Ukraine." No 
one is likely to disagree with the statement that an effective 
struggle against the drug menace necessitates the united efforts 
of all state and public organizations. The creation of the 
National Coordinating Council To Combat Drug Abuse could be 
viewed as the first step, and the next logical step was the 
creation of a special agency of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health 
to establish control over the production and distribution of 
medicines containing narcotic substances. That is how our 
committee came into being. 
  [Vilenskiy] How will it operate? 
  [Belyavskiy] First of all, we will be guided by the articles 
of the UN Convention on Narcotic Substances (1961) and the UN 
Convention on Psychotropic Drugs (1971) and by Ukrainian laws. 
  Now that our state is effectively on its own in the fight 
against the expanding drug traffic, we need a new and more 
responsible approach to the import and export of drugs and 
semimanufactured products containing narcotic and psychotropic 
substances. Their inclusion in legal records, the issuance of 
permits to establishments and institutions for the use of these 
substances for scientific and medical purposes, the drafting of 
drug use standards in medicine and science, and the replacement 
of those that might lead to pathological addiction are the 
responsibility of the new committee. 
  This is far from a complete list of what we plan to do. 
After 
all, there are no secondary issues in today's world of medicines 
and drugs. Incidentally, certificates of authorization to import 
and export narcotic drugs have already been approved. Now these 
regulating documents of the Drug Control Committee will be 
obligatory. 
  The statute on the committee was approved by the Ukrainian 
Ministry of Health and Ministry of Internal Affairs. The 
committee members are medical experts and pharmacologists, as 
well as representatives of the Ukrainian Supreme Court, Security 
Service, Customs Service, Ministry of Justice, and ministries of 
foreign and internal affairs. Therefore, it is an 
interdepartmental subdivision on the state level. 
  [Vilenskiy] Vladimir Gavrilovich, you have a draft of the 
law 
of Ukraine on the procedure for handling narcotic drugs, 
psychotropic substances, and precursors on your desk. Our 
readers probably have not heard anything about it.... 
  [Belyavskiy] I will begin by clarifying the terminology. 
Narcotic drugs are the plants and compounds described as such in 
international conventions and categorized as such by our 
committee. Then there are the psychotropic drugs that can be 
dangerous to human health because of their psychological 
effects. Finally, precursors are the substances and salts used 
as chemical raw material in the production of narcotic drugs and 
psychotropic substances. 
  The draft law consists of 33 sections covering this whole 
complex sphere. The passage of the law will be of inestimable 
importance to the future of Ukraine. 
  [Vilenskiy] As far as I know, the law also restricts the 
cultivation of opium poppies and several strains of hemp used as 
narcotic raw materials. 
  [Belyavskiy] Yes, and this is of vital importance. Besides 
this, it also proposes a new type of prescription for narcotic 
and psychotropic drugs. Medicine needs these drugs, but strict 
records will be kept of all prescription forms to guard against 
forgery. Each prescription will be recorded in a register, and 
receipts will confirm the legal acquisition of the drugs. In 
other words, the law will stipulate specific procedures for the 
physician and the pharmacist. It should guard us against drug 
abuse and protect the health care system from encroachments by 
the "black market."

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Filenko, Ukraine people's deputy, </F>
chairman of the board of the Party of Democratic Renewal of 
Ukraine: "Who Does Not Learn From Other Revolutions Will Get His 
Own"] 
  [Text] This is not malicious rhetoric but an unfortunate 
fact: in the years since independence life in Ukraine has 
worsened. The eternal philosophical question "How to Live?" has 
turned for many of our compatriots into a desperate query: "How 
to Survive?" 
  Two years ago Ukraine inherited a total general crisis. 
Along 
with independence, the Ukrainian people got an opportunity to 
live by their own wits. How did they use this opportunity? 
  The Soviet Union disappeared from the map two years ago; 
yet, 
we still have a part of the Soviet economic system, not yet a 
Ukrainian economy. Production is not geared toward Ukrainian 
resources and needs but toward making output which we do not 
need from raw materials and components which we do not have. 
This is why without a radical structural overhaul of the 
Ukrainian economy based on its resources and needs we will 
neither be able to provide a normal life for the people nor 
achieve complete independence for the country. Nor will a 
structural overhaul be enough in itself. We must stop the 
printing press which churns out money. 
  This reminds me of the comic play "The Wedding in Malinovka" 
and its colorful character, Popandopulo the Financier. He is no 
miser: on the contrary, he pays readily with the money which he 
himself prints, repeating: "Go ahead, take it; I can draw myself 
new bills." It seems that the monetary policy of the National 
Bank is based on the same principle. 
  While irresponsible emission weakens the karbovanets, the 
use 
of hard currency in domestic transactions renders it totally 
useless. Until Ukrainian money becomes the only legal tender in 
Ukraine, the talk of stabilizing Ukrainian finances will only 
serve to disguise anti-Ukrainian financial policies. I am not 
proposing to restore the Iron Curtain or bring back xenophobia: 
since the exchange of currency is an integral part of a normally 
functioning economy, how come there are stores all over Ukraine, 
where Ukrainian money is not accepted? 
  An integral part of the current financial policy is the 
fixing of the dollar exchange rate by the National Bank. In 
general, it is normal to have fixed exchange rates. In Poland, 
for instance, it is one of the most important components of 
Balcerowics' brilliant stabilization plan. Nor does it matter 
what level the exchange rate is set at, as long as it is a rate 
of exchange (i.e., of free purchase and sale), and not 
confiscation. How else to call the compulsory exchange of one 
half of their hard currency earnings imposed on enterprises? 
And, to make sure that they could not make up their losses by 
selling the rest of their hard currency at the currency 
exchange, the exchange has now been shut down. 
  Money, both foreign and domestic, has a bad luck in Ukraine. 
Both experts and officials at every level have talked so much of 
new money being printed, or already printed, that monetary 
reform became unavoidable. Expectations of it in Ukraine as well 
as abroad are so strong that from the psychological point of 
view the karbovanets can no longer be stabilized. How to 
stabilize a currency that has lost all credibility and whose 
replacement is expected from one day to the next? 
  The optimal solution would be to introduce the hryvna in 
parallel with the karbovanets and then to withdraw the latter 
gradually. Perhaps other methods would turn out to be better. 
But should this candy-wrapper game go on? The choice is up to us. 
  Simple replacement of one kind of paper with another would 
not be of any use. The proper effect would be achieved only by 
coordinated monetary and banking reform in the context of 
general economic reform. What is needed is a two-level banking 
infrastructure with the National Bank at the top level and a 
broad network of flexible, independent, mainly private 
commercial banks at the lower level. 
  The hryvna may be brought into circulation from the start as 
freely convertible within Ukraine. Creating the hard currency 
stabilization fund to support the exchange rate is a feasible 
task, if it is given the highest priority. 
  However, the stabilization fund will be exhausted quickly 
unless there are goods that the hryvna can buy. Until the engine 
of the market economy starts humming, it could be mainly real 
estate and land. There is no reason to fear: privatized land 
plots will not go anywhere from Ukraine but will be utilized 
more efficiently--including also by those who band together into 
cooperatives. 
  Our state is not poor, it is rich. It is the Ukrainian 
people 
who are poor. The state owns 90 percent of all property: the 
land, the raw materials, the factories and the 
stores--practically all of Ukraine. This enormous wealth is not 
traded (at least not legally); it has been artificially 
withdrawn from the market and is not tradable. 
  Since there is a shortage of goods for sale, prices go up, 
inflation increases and money quickly loses its value. It is not 
profitable to invest into long-term projects which are necessary 
to establish new enterprises, restructure existing ones and 
effect a structural overhaul--in short, to develop production. 
As a result, money is either spent in retail trade, where it 
turns over quickly, or is siphoned abroad, where business 
conditions are much more favorable. In Ukraine, meanwhile, 
inflation, combined with the decline of output, is turning into 
stagflation. 
  In these conditions, privatization is the greatest 
anti-monopoly factor. State monopoly, on the other hand, makes 
it possible to hike prices without shame and with impunity. The 
domination of the state sector in the production of consumer 
goods and retail trade means a harsh choice between an orgy of 
price hikes which we see today and low prices with a gradual but 
inexorable withdrawal of goods from legal trade which we had in 
the past. 
  Private production and trade mean sufficient quantity 
of goods and socially acceptable prices, whereas state 
production and trade result either in out-of-this-world prices 
on down-to-earth goods or in low prices on nonexistent goods. 
  Some 2,000 years ago, in his treatise "On Duties" Cicero 
wrote as though it had long been obvious: "It is important that 
people use public property as public and private property as 
their own." Thousands of years have passed. Today's bureaucrats 
have grown accustomed to managing public property "in the name 
and on the behalf of the people," which means totally without 
accountability. If we take into account that they control land, 
residential and commercial real estate and plenty of other 
property, it would become clear that a gold mine is like nothing 
compared to what the bureaucrats have. Combined with a variety 
of permits, licenses and limitations, excessive state power 
becomes the foundation for abuse and corruption. This is why the 
black market is the only one that flourishes and constantly 
grows in Ukraine. 
  Privatization will move great quantities of goods from 
the black market to the legal one. There is no better cure from 
both inflation and corruption. 
  Ukraine is not yet democratic, but it is no longer 
totalitarian. People can talk, hold rallies and strike. 
Employees of the state sector can now press their demands, which 
are both reasonable and, at the same time, unrealistic. People 
think that the state, if it only wished, could satisfy 
everybody's demands. 
  Similar problems exist in France, Italy and other countries. 
This clearly shows that a market economy, democracy and a large 
state sector are incompatible, because a great temptation arises 
to seek improvements in the living standard not in accordance 
with economic development but by means of non-economic pressure. 
  In the West, the low point was reached during miner strikes 
in the 1970s in Great Britain, which in a large measure brought 
about the replacement of the Labor government by the 
Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. The problem was 
solved radically and efficiently: by privatization. As a result, 
the living standard in Great Britain increased considerably, 
including that of workers, and especially that of miners. 
  For the same reasons privatization was effected in the 
Canadian province of British Columbia, in Australia and in New 
Zealand. Privatization is going on in France, Germany, Sweden 
and Italy. And in every country of the former USSR. Except in 
Ukraine. 
  These examples lead to the following conclusion: mass 
privatization has a major positive impact, both immediate and 
indirect. This is not a concession to fashion, nor another 
imported idea, but a deliberate step toward healing the economy. 
This is why the Party of Democratic Renewal of Ukraine (PDVU) 
advocates rapid, large-scale privatization of both small and 
large enterprises. 
  However, privatization alone will not suffice. We also need 
new, competitive enterprises. This is why privatization must be 
complemented by the urgent development of private enterprise, 
most importantly of the small and medium market segments. We 
have talked often enough of the back-breaking tax burden that 
law-abiding entrepreneurs cannot afford, but cause for complaint 
has not diminished. I have already mentioned the fact that the 
state takes 50 percent of hard currency earnings, paying almost 
nothing in return. I could mention many other examples of how 
private enterprise is being pressured, but what for? Questions 
whether the state creates favorable conditions for economic 
initiative or inhibits it, or whether it protects citizens from 
bureaucratic and criminal extortion or encourages it, seem 
rhetorical. 
  Nevertheless, given the lack of favorable conditions for 
business activity of the population, these are the questions of 
survival. There could have been instructions hanging everywhere 
on how to open and manage a private business, whereas organizing 
assistance to beginners could have become top priority. 
  The main goal of a private enterprise is return on 
investment, or profit. The state, on the other hand, has a 
different set of priorities. A state entrepreneur is above all a 
servant of the state. His goal is to do what is best for the 
state and for his career, not business considerations. A private 
enterprise is much more efficient than a state one. This has 
been proven by historical experience and is clearly illustrated 
by the living standards of the people in the Free World. 
  Since the Iron Curtain has fallen, only those who do not 
want 
to hear do not know this. Social Democratic parties, after 
coming to power, traditionally carried out nationalization. As a 
result, a sizable state sector exists in the West. But they have 
become convinced that this is harmful and have revised their 
programs radically. Now they advocate strong social security 
systems within the confines of the free market economy. 
  Rich people do not exist only in America: they exist 
everywhere where there is money. They existed under Stalin's 
orthodox socialism and under Brezhnev's developed socialism; 
they exist today, too, while socialism is on its death throes. 
But only the market economy helps create a large class of 
proprietors, the third estate. In developed countries it has 
become the majority of the population. It is comprised of 
businessmen and farmers, teachers and doctors, scientists and 
skilled workers. 
  Prosperity does not fall from the skies like manna, nor does 
the middle class appear out of nothing, as though by magic. It 
is built up gradually, with diligence and hard work. Neither the 
Europeans nor the Americans have always had the kind of standard 
of living they enjoy today. Nor do all countries with a market 
economy prosper yet. There is no ideal, but there are decent 
examples and, therefore, hope. The living standard in countries 
which combine the market economy with a multiparty parliamentary 
system is considerably better than in any other social structure 
that humanity has known. 
  Availability of goods, a large middle class and the 
fruits of the market economy are the guarantees of stability and 
dynamic, harmonious development of society. 
  Lack of energy and raw materials and irregularities in 
foreign commercial relations, primarily with Russia, are a 
reality. But how important can this be when gas, water and other 
valuable resources are squandered without control and the energy 
intensity of production in Ukraine exceeds considerably the same 
indicators in France, Germany and Denmark? 
  The insistence that external factors are the main cause of 
our problems is empty talk, substitution of the root causes of 
our economic crisis with other, less important ones and an 
attempt to shun responsibility for our own shortcomings. 
  Our state is not poor, our country has not been cursed with 
a 
poor climate and our land is fertile and has other resources. It 
is not Ukraine that is resource-poor; it is Iceland that lacks 
resources and is but a volcanic island battered by the winds. 
Yet, its per capita income is a little higher than in the US. 
Denmark is a country perched on dunes; yet, its people live so 
well that only after a second attempt they were persuaded to 
approve the Maastricht Treaty. The Japanese also live well. 
  The wonder is not that we live poorly but that we are alive 
at all. We live poorly because government leaders have bad 
policies which do not encourage people to work but to beg, 
demand and steal. Why do we have such policies? 
  Of course, there is plenty of incompetence and lack of 
professionalism. The traditional brain drain to Moscow and lack 
of experience governing a country and not a province and poor 
professional education under the Soviet regime all have had 
their impact. Moreover, a Soviet economist and an economist are 
not the same thing; nor is it always clear which impulse in the 
leadership would win over: that which comes from the experience 
of management or of destruction. 
  But above and beyond all these factors, the fact is that the 
ruling elite implements the kind of policy it wants. Ukraine is 
not ruled by little kids but by rational human beings who make 
conscious decisions and consciously accept their obvious, 
foreseeable consequences. 
  There is no need either to discover America, or to reinvent 
the wheel, or to seek out a nonexistent program for a quick and 
painless transition to a living standard similar to that of 
Sweden or even of Greece. The fundamentals of the true market 
economy, which are in the main identical in Japan, the EU and 
the US, are well-known. So are the blueprints for accelerated 
development of Third World countries and for the transition of 
socialist economies to the free market. Not only are they 
well-known, but they have been tested in practice, as 
continuously proven to work in Europe, Asia and Russia. Problems 
do arise, but the ultimate success of such policies is already 
clear--in those countries where they have been adopted. 
  In Ukraine, on the other hand, laws on the privatization of 
small and large enterprises that were passed a year and a half 
ago have not been implemented yet. State privatization programs 
for 1992 and 1993 were deliberately sabotaged. The same is true 
of the Cabinet of Ministers' decree on the privatization of 
backyard and dacha plots for 1993. 
  Are the authorities ignorant of this? Or perhaps they lack 
the ability? No, it is desire that they lack. Property 
without proprietors, business without businessmen allows them to 
combine without accountability the license of an owner with the 
lack of responsibility of a hired hand. If you can live like 
this you do not want to change anything. 
  But it can not go on like this. Privatization is 
unavoidable. 
Life and economic necessity will gain the upper hand. Everybody 
understands this. Preparation for large-scale privatization goes 
on. In a rather unusual way, however. Transition to a corporate 
structure, breakup of large enterprises, buyouts and 
commercialization go on slowly and in some cases only 
superficially. But, at the same time, busy replacement of signs 
and the establishment of pseudo-market entities and small 
enterprises in the state sector that live off state authority go 
full-steam ahead. 
  On the one hand, this is a way to transfer public funds and 
even property into private pockets and, on the other, a seizure 
of advantageous starting positions which, once mass 
privatization has been declared, would automatically lead to the 
transfer of better properties into privileged hands. 
  Based on this scenario, mass privatization would formally 
begin only after the de facto privatization of highly 
profitable properties has been completed. There are many tasty 
morsels, and it takes time to share them out. Privatization is 
being delayed while the lion is getting ready to leap. 
  Those who are willing to learn can learn a lesson from 
history: whenever the people realize that property is being 
distributed unfairly there is trouble. In 1961, the Russian 
Emperor granted the serfs freedom without land. The outcome is 
well-known. 
  Since the majority of the population have been excluded from 
privatization and have no chance of acquiring their fair share 
of national (and not state) property, none of the leaders will 
be able to sleep or to conduct business in peace. Freedom 
without property is a time bomb placed under the privatization 
process as well as under the economic future of the country. The 
specter of communism roams Ukraine. Who does not learn from 
other revolutions will get his own. 
  This is why the best possible method of privatization is the 
one that is most fair. Such would be a free distribution of a 
major portion (more than half) of property among all 
proprietors, i.e., all Ukrainian citizens. Some maintain that 
this would mean forced privatization, or collectivization 
backwards. It is correct. Collectivization was robbery. 
Distribution among the people would be restitution of stolen 
property. Indeed, collectivization backwards. 
  Today, this approach is used sparingly and altogether 
insufficiently. Sum total of privatization--K1.050 million--is 
clearly too little and the list of targets is too short, while 
there are few enthusiasts and information about the program is 
being disseminated poorly. We should learn from Russia or, 
better still, the Czech Republic, both how to popularize and 
explain vouchers and to offer a variety of opportunities for 
making use of them. 
  The people of Ukraine do not suffer from market reforms but 
from their absence. Not only are market reforms not implemented; 
they are being systematically discredited. Partly revised and 
partly monopoly prices are now called free prices, the ongoing 
theft of property privatization, massive fraud entrepreneurship 
and the whole thing market reform. In this way, people feel 
anger and hatred toward the market, reform and reformers. 
  Instead, we hear calls for a state of emergency in the 
economy and for responsible commissions, committees, etc. There 
is no need for any such steps. We have had a state of emergency 
in the economy for 70 years, as well as its advocates in power. 
Ukraine needs the opposite: a normal economic system and a 
normal, competent government formed by a normal, politically 
accountable parliament. 
  From this emerges the key aspect of our differences: 
politics. Economic reform is the function of power. The hope 
that it could be implemented by a group of professors of 
economics is a pipe dream. If those who have political power 
(the parliament and the president) want reforms and delineate 
their general direction, specialists will have the 
responsibility to work out the needed programs and legislative 
agenda, and administrators to carry them out. 
  Collectivization was not carried out by peasants or by 
experimental economists, but by Bolshevik leaders. The economic 
miracle in postwar Germany, achieved under the direct leadership 
of Economic Minister Erhard, had been first sanctioned by the 
Allied occupying powers and strongly supported by Chancellor 
Adenauer and the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social 
Union in the Bundestag. Growth in the US and Britain in the 
1980s was spearheaded by the political will of Ronald Reagan and 
Margaret Thatcher and their cohorts. 
  The most important precondition for reform is the 
election of a reformist parliament and a reformist president, 
and the formation of a reformist government. 
  Can this be achieved in the coming elections? It can, but by 
accident. The majority in the existing Supreme Council, which 
only pretended to carry out reform and was busy discrediting it, 
made sure that the incoming Supreme Council was the same. To 
this end, it passed the old election law, making it worse. The 
elections will be held on a non-party basis, which means that 
the voters will be voting for individual deputies, not for a 
specific political line, politicians or policy. 
  Existing democracies have several forms of election laws. 
But 
they all are meant to establish a parliament whose members are 
divided into party factions. The majority party forms the 
government and is therefore responsible for the chosen policy. 
On the line are votes in the next election. By assessing 
election platforms of the parties and comparing them with recent 
past, the voters have a clear framework for deciding for whom to 
vote. 
  This does not, and cannot, exist in a non-party election in 
which candidates represent no organized political force or 
tradition. Political connections and true intentions of 
so-called independent candidates are all too often concealed and 
come out only when they are already in the Supreme Council. 
  Multiparty elections are a way to achieve a functional, 
well-structured and responsible government, while non-party 
elections are a way to create a politically anonymous, 
irresponsible Supreme Council. 
  Success does not come in a day. Western countries reached 
prosperity only after they combined the market economy with a 
multiparty democracy. The same process is now under way in 
countries which only recently were living under dictatorship, 
such as Spain, Portugal, Chile and South Korea. 
  It is not an accident that the Supreme Council, whose policy 
has been to impede market reforms, has chosen as its political 
priority the path of sabotaging a multiparty system. It would be 
naive to hope that a Supreme Council elected in this manner, 
whatever its composition, would improve our living standards. As 
long as supporters of economic and political democracy remain 
divided and disorganized, the party in power will continue to 
pursue its line, accompanied by vile demagoguery. 
  In short, economic and political reform can only be blocked 
due to the weakness of its supporters. The only way to be 
respected is to become strong, and the only way to do so is to 
unite. A club of like-minded people is a good idea but it is not 
enough. A voter club is also a good idea, but it is not a 
lasting one. We need permanent, stable organizations of 
citizens: parties. Do not wait for favors from above--they are 
not forthcoming. Unite instead.

IZVESTIYA: "War and Peace in Prigorodnyy Rayon"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  III. THE THEATER OF MILITARY OPERATIONS </H5>
  At about 0300, Khizha, Shoygu, and Filatov went to a 
suburban 
residence to catch some sleep. As soon as they fell asleep, they 
were awakened by the clamor of a battle. 
  Internal troops commander Savvin spent the night in the 
office of the military school commander and, having learned of 
an intensive exchange of fire near the government residence, 
sent a detail there. The detail reported: "It is our own." The 
detail ruined the spectacle, and the shooting stopped. 
  As GKChS [State Committee on Emergency Situation] Chairman 
Shoygu, his deputy Colonel General Filatov, and internal troops 
Commander Colonel General Savvin noted, a considerable share of 
reports on the happenings were invented or the events themselves 
staged. The special predilection for this was shown by the North 
Ossetian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], the republic's MB 
[Ministry of Security], and their press centers. It appeared 
that episodes of a scenario prepared in advance were being 
retold. Military and MB personnel alternately reported 
periodically on Ingush tanks coming from somewhere, on Ingush 
APC's [armored personnel carriers] breaking through, on Ingush 
artillery. Reports were predominantly delivered verbally, and 
decisions had to be made on the spot. 
  It was reported to Shoygu that according to operational 
data, 
two Su-25 fighter planes were discovered in the Ingush 
settlement of Muzhichi. He ordered helicopters to fly there to 
verify the reports, to the laughter of others, who explained to 
him that the people in the mountainous village of Muzhichi there 
have never been any asphalt paving, let alone a take-off strip 
for a Su-25. 
  Even before the conflict broke out, the internal troops 
commander received a report from the North Ossetian MVD on 
movements of tanks from the Chechen side and armored vehicles 
from the Ingush side, on shelling of administrative buildings in 
Prigorodnyy Rayon. Every time a check revealed that the reports 
were not true. 
  During the days of the armed conflict, intensive 
reconnaissance--airborne, among other kinds--refuted Ossetian 
side's information that Ingush allegedly had some structured 
system of armed formations. They did not have armored vehicles, 
tanks, or rocket-propelled Grad systems. But the 
authoritativeness of the sources, among which were not only the 
republic's enforcement agencies but also its statesmen, required 
continuous verification of the coming reports. 
  Judging by the statements of the North Ossetian leadership, 
Ingush armed formations were seizing internal affairs 
departments here and there. Savvin had a communications officer 
stationed in Oktyabrskoye, and all he had to do was pick up the 
receiver--to find out that he had been lied to again. 
  Still, there were embarrassments. What happened on that day 
in Dachnyy, Chermen, and in the Chermen circle could only be 
explained by the fact that the military was put in a position of 
actors familiar with the plot of a play but not with their parts 
and therefore forced to improvise. An airborne troops regiment 
of the Pskov internal troops division immediately upon arrival 
went to cover Chermen. They got on their way close to the 
evening, and when the reconnaissance unit in PFV's [paratroop 
fighting vehicle] approached Chermen, shots sounded. The 
commander thought they had been fired upon. In the darkness they 
approached Dachnyy instead of Chermen, by mistake. They opened 
"return" fire on Dachnyy's outskirts as well. One fighting 
vehicle, making a turn near a bridge, hit a land mine; two 
paratroopers died. The second, a PFV, was reported to the 
commander as having been captured by the enemy (as it turned out 
later, the crew lost their way and ended up in Nazran). 
  The paratroopers thought they saw tanks. The regiment 
commander reported to corps headquarters, to the deputy 
commander of internal troops General Chindarov, that he was 
engaged in a battle and the fire was very dense, denser than in 
Afghanistan. At about 0100, another report--this time of 
encountering unidentified armored forces. Savvin got in touch 
with Chindarov on the telephone, who confirmed that heavy 
fighting was in progress, but could not tell anything regarding 
casualties. Upon arrival at corps headquarters, Savvin found 
Chindarov talking to the commander of the Russian Air Force. 
Chindarov was asking for air support. It was promised to him. He 
was told that support aircraft would be taking off shortly from 
several airfields. 
  In the morning, the generals in helicopters inspected the 
areas of "heavy fighting." A burned Moskvich; a burned bus; and 
no traces of tanks. 
  Thus ended the Russian Army's biggest battle in this 
imaginary war. 
<H5>  CLEANSING THE TERRITORY </H5>
  On 1 November 1992 at 0540, a massive artillery shelling of 
all population centers of compact habitation of Ingush began. In 
the afternoon, units of the Pskov Airborne Division began to 
arrive. 
  At 1600 official representatives of North Ossetia and 
Ingushetia met on the territory of the 19th Division (settlement 
Sputnik). The decision was made for a cease-fire at 1800. The 
Ingush accepted the proposed terms. The fire only became denser, 
however. 
  The president's representative Issa Kostoyev was calling 
Khizha. Khizha demanded new negotiations, stalled; Khizha and 
Galazov had different plans, and Ingush capitulation did not fit 
in. In the opinion of former internal troops commander V.N. 
Savvin, all that was needed was just one division that could be 
positioned against the national guard and thus extinguish the 
conflict. One! In his opinion, the Ossetian leadership, which 
insisted on "cleansing" the territory, was against separating 
the conflicting sides. Galazov saw the task of this purge in a 
methodical disarmament from house to house, which meant people 
had to be squeezed out. 
  Khizha accepted Galazov's plan, although he knew of I. 
Kostoyev's proposal--to advance the troops from the direction of 
Beslan, in order to block the zone from both sides. Still, had 
the MVD troops entered shortly after the paratroopers, setting 
up posts and commandants' offices, there would have been fewer 
casualties and less cruelty and destruction. The internal troops 
were in no hurry, however. Instead, it was the Ossetian OMON 
[Special Designation Militia Detachments], republican guard, 
people's volunteer corps, and South Ossetian units commanded by 
Teziyev, a deputy chairman of South Ossetian Council of 
Ministers, who entered Prigorodnyy Rayon villages in the 
paratroopers' wake. The latter, by the testimony of everyone, 
including the top military, displayed particular cruelty. 
  Later, the belated entry of the internal troops was blamed 
on 
Colonel General V.N. Savvin. The reasons he cited in his defense 
are indeed not very convincing, and the consequences of his 
inability to get things organized are frightening. But could he 
cite real reasons? 
  Moreover, both Savvin and Shoygu get touchy when it comes to 
questions about interaction with North Ossetian armed 
formations. Forced to admit that he as the senior troops 
commander was instructed by Khizha to take command of the 
unified forces, General Savvin immediately points out that the 
republican guard and the volunteers corps were not subordinated 
to him, but remains silent about the North Ossetian MVD units. 
Sergey Shoygu maintains that the participation of the volunteers 
corps, the guards, and the "southerners" was not envisaged by 
the plan. Shoygu does not answer, however, a direct question 
about the actions against the "aggressors" by the united front 
of the Russian Army and the Ossetian side. 
  Shoygu speaks of the republican guard as a well-organized 
formation armed in the military fashion; the volunteer corps he 
considers as something akin to loose guerrilla groups. Both 
Savvin and Shoygu believe that the participation of Kudarians 
from the south in punitive actions was the initiative of the 
North Ossetian leadership. 
  The generals are in a difficult situation. If they admit 
that 
North Ossetian formations, fortified by a South Ossetian 
"peacekeeping" battalion, were part of the unified forces, they 
would have to accept part of the responsibility for the massacre 
in Prigorodnyy Rayon. As to Savvin's inability to get organized, 
keeping in mind Khizha's stalling in negotiations with the 
Ingush, it looks artificial. 
  If they admit that the Ossetian republican guard and 
volunteer corps were not subordinate to anyone, including 
Ossetian leadership, this makes their illegitimacy inarguable, 
and they have to be declared dangerous gang formations. In this 
case, there is an obvious fault of the political and military 
leadership, who did not take any steps to disarm and disband 
them. I could even feel sorry for both generals, had I not seen 
corpses of men with their throats slashed and of women with 
traces of torture on their bodies. 
  Even by the admission of the Ossetian press, all kinds of 
armaments, including heavy, were used against the Ingush. On 11 
November 1992 the newspaper SEVERNAYA OSETIYA ran a photo of 
tanks in a battle formation with this caption: "Military units 
participating in cleansing the territory of North Ossetia of 
Ingush gang formations more than once had to deploy heavy 
hardware and use tank firepower. In the photo: tanks during an 
attack". 
  Whom did these tanks attack? 
  Both Shoygu and Savvin admit that the Ingush did not have 
military-type armed formations; that their armed groups numbered 
25-30 persons each; that they had no arms other than firearms 
and several captured APC's. Yes, the tanks attacked the homes of 
peaceful residents, and the unified forces of Russia and Ossetia 
were not conducting a military operation--they were cleansing 
Prigorodnyy Rayon of "persons of Ingush origin." 
  I should probably write that Galazov's plan was given life. 
But the word "life" is not appropriate here. The purpose of the 
operation was, as already mentioned, to push the Ingush out at 
any cost. All of them, to the last man. Therefore, cruelty was 
part of the set of tools, and there is nothing surprising about 
that. 
  Neither is it surprising that public opinion in North 
Ossetia, with minor exceptions, supported and justified this 
cruelty. 
  After all, the propaganda apparatus that had remained since 
Stalin's time and now was supplemented by no-longer-concealed 
nationalistic texture, deluged citizens of Ossetia with an 
avalanche of impressive cliches, legends, and heart-rending 
details. A strictly civilian person--a Vladikavkaz 
designer--told me on the way: 'Having heard of children's heads 
chopped off and pinned on fence spikes in Chermen, I came to the 
volunteer corps headquarters and offered the use of myself and 
my car for the defense of the republic." 
  According to the latest data of the provisional 
administration, fortunately, not a single Ossetian child was 
killed during the war. 
<H5>  FROM THE IZVESTIYA FILE </H5>
  Information of casualties (from the investigation 
materials): 
  Overall, 546 persons died during the days of the armed 
conflict. Of them, 407 were Ingush and 105--Ossetians. 
  Among the dead are 41 women (33 Ingush and five 
Ossetians), 12 children under 15 (all on the Ingush side), and 
49 persons over 60 (42 Ingush and 7 Ossetians). 
  By other reckoning, a total of 1,300 persons were 
killed on both sides. 
<H5>  VLADIKAVKAZ, INGUSHETIA, CHECHNYA. 2-11 NOVEMBER </H5>
  Beginning 2 November, a state of emergency was imposed on 
the 
territory of North Ossetia and Ingushetia. All power in the 
state of emergency zone was vested with the provisional 
administration headed by Georgiy Khizha. Sergey Shoygu was 
appointed Khizha's deputy. For almost two days they possessed 
almost dictatorial powers, until under pressure from North 
Ossetia the president relented and issued a new edict, which in 
essence restricted the powers of the local authorities only on 
the territory of Ingushetia. They have not used their power and 
strength for peacekeeping, however; instead, they used them as 
if they were on the one side of the front line confronted by the 
commensurate strength of an enemy power. 
  Actually, the inquisitive mind of the deputy head of 
provisional administration moved him once to a heroic deed 
comparable only with actions of the unforgettable Shtirlits. 
  On the night from 3 to 4 November, he drove in a Volga car 
with two bodyguards through Beslan and Mayskoye to Nazran's 
central square. Incognito. 
  None of the local top officials expected him in Nazran. 
There 
were a lot of people on the square--a rally was in progress. All 
speeches were in the Ingush language, and therefore he did not 
understand a word. 
  He did not see any armored vehicles there. He did not meet 
with any of the local leaders. He stood there, walked around, 
and returned to Vladikavkaz the same way, unimpeded. 
  So what did Sergey Kuzhugetovich report to the center from 
his deep undercover mission? "Could not understand a word"? 
  He was not afraid of a bullet. What he did not have the guts 
to do in Nazran was to get up to the second floor of the 
building in front of which the rally was in progress, to meet 
Issa Kostoyev, Ruslan Aushev, Commandant Musa Tsechoyev--also, 
by the way, Russian generals--and listen to "the other side." 
How else can one explain then why Sergey Shoygu, a man 
undoubtedly intelligent, energetic, and knowledgeable about his 
business, closed his eyes to what he saw, and did not see what 
he looked at? 
  The GKChS Chairman Shoygu, Colonel General Filatov, and 
Colonel General Savvin, who arrived in the zone of conflict--or, 
to be precise, to the capital of North Ossetia, Vladikavkaz--had 
been here before, had established official and personal 
contacts. One could explain by these factors their openly 
pro-Ossetian position, had it not been for two considerations. 
The generals' remarks and actions were so one-sided that they 
could be regarded not just as politically tactless, but as 
provocational. 
  For instance, Colonel General Filatov, speaking on 
Vladikavkaz television, stated: "Russia has not forgotten its 
loyal Ossetian sons, who served it faithfully and honorably for 
many years. And as early as today, the airborne troops, jointly 
with Russian internal troops and the troops of the North 
Ossetian Ministry of Internal Affairs, will begin military 
operations.... With every passing hour this pressure on the 
aggressor will be increasing." Having confided that he has 
acquired many loyal friends among Ossetians--apparently the kind 
only Ossetians can be--the general suggested that all Ossetian 
families should leave the zone of conflict so that the troops 
could operate without looking over their shoulder. "I basically 
followed the text Galazov wrote for me," Filatov later would 
explain innocently. 
  What is worse is that G. Khizha, a deputy prime minister of 
the Russian Government, whose intellectual level is attested to 
by the title of professor, and who has no known personal reasons 
for pro-Ossetian sympathies, immediately upon arrival took the 
same one-sided position and, speaking on television, said that 
Ossetia is a loyal friend of Russia and that he will do 
everything possible to clear its land of Ingush aggressors. In 
addition, Khizha did not denounce any of the gross anti-Ingush 
statements of Ossetian leader Galazov; neither did he refute 
Galazov's numerous statements regarding military operations 
jointly with Russian troops against another part of Russia--the 
Ingush Republic. 
  One would think that such behavior on the part of the 
highest 
Russian official sent from Moscow with a peacekeeping mission 
and the statements and actions of the generals subordinate to 
him should have immediately prompted the president of all 
Russians to recall and demand the resignation of officials and 
military people who have discredited both him and themselves. 
Nothing like this happened until a certain time, however. It 
looks as if Khizha and others had received a dispensation in 
advance. As to the military, they had been publicly relieved by 
the presidential address from any pangs of conscience and doubts 
with respect to the legitimacy of their orders. "Your actions 
are protected," declared the president, "and are guaranteed by 
the law and affirmed by the people." But could it be that B.N. 
Yeltsin would give the troops an indulgence for the massacre of 
civilian Russian citizens? After all, only two years earlier he 
spoke to the troops with these soul-touching words: "You may be 
told that with your help order will be restored in society. But 
can you consider violating the Constitution and the laws as 
restoration of order, because this is precisely what you are 
being pushed into by those who strive to solve political 
problems with the help of the might of Army units.... By 
carrying out the order....to use arms against the civilian 
population, you are becoming a tool in the hands of dark forces 
of reaction." 
  These were the same troops--the Pskov paratroop division; 
and 
the laws were the same. Could the president have changed that 
much over a short period of time? Even knowing now of the tragic 
experience of October 1993, let us not forget that in 
Prigorodnyy Rayon we were dealing not with an insurrection, and 
not with the danger of a split in the Army and a civil war in 
the entire of Russia. 
  If we assume, however, that what the president meant was not 
a war against the civilian population, but military operations 
against the army of another state, then everything falls into 
place. The only army not subordinated to Commander in Chief B. 
Yeltsin in the North Caucasus was the Chechen army. Now the 
closing words of the president's address acquire at least some 
meaning: "The honor and dignity of Russia, its security and 
territorial integrity, must be ensured." 
  This pathos cannot possibly refer to a conflict between the 
inhabitants of two small Russian republics.... 
  Before his trip to Vladikavkaz on 31 October 1992, Deputy 
Prime Minister Georgiy Khizha had in his possession a secret 
decision of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, 
signed by Skokov. One would imagine that a person of such high 
rank as a deputy prime minister also received verbal information 
of an especially confidential nature. What about? We can 
reconstruct it only by accidental slips in the available 
documents and statements of G. Khizha, carried away in his role. 
And most importantly, by what was happening in those several 
days. 
  At the time, the secretary of the Russian Federation 
Security 
Council, Skokov, attempted to introduce censorship in the 
Russian mass media by sending to television and to newspapers an 
nonclassified excerpt from a classified document. But this 
document is interesting not because of Skokov's natural 
emotional move, but by its suddenly prominent Chechen motif. The 
Russian mass media were prescribed not to allow "reports that 
provoke escalation of an armed conflict, first and foremost on 
the part of the leadership of Chechnya as an illegitimate 
formation on the territory of the Chechen-Ingush SSR." 
  G. Khizha apparently got such a powerful impetus in Moscow 
that during the first day of his Vladikavkaz visit he still 
continued publicly to expound on the Chechen factor. To confused 
Ossetian journalists, who dutifully retold government rumors of 
a high-powered Ingush offensive, he said that "Right now there 
is no other danger except that which arises on the part of 
Chechnya," and remarked ominously: "Some solution to this 
problem must be found." And once again: "This issue must remain 
in the field of vision of the Government of Russia, and it must 
be resolved." 
  The Chechens, however, were displaying indifference not 
anticipated by Moscow, and Dudayev even went as far as to 
proclaim his neutrality. But a peacekeeping mission that arrived 
to Ossetia at the time Khizha was there was not permitted to 
proceed to Vladikavkaz on 4 November. The untimely peace-loving 
behavior on the part of Chechens clearly irritated the head of 
the Provisional Administration. This irritation he turned 
against Colonel General Savvin. The internal troops commander 
was accused of bringing them into the zone of conflict at a 
wrong time. Savvin, on the other hand, kept saying stubbornly 
that he did not agree that troops should be sent into 
Ingushetia. Thus, until 10 November they did not have the 
opportunity to bring Russian tanks into Groznyy on the backs of 
the retreating Chechen army. 
  It is hard to tell what role in this other example of 
brilliant planning was played by Vice President Rutskoy, but in 
the past he already had tried in the president's absence to 
impose a state of emergency in Chechnya and to grind Dudayev's 
regime into dust; what he achieved was an unconditional 
consolidation of the Chechen people and a sharp rise of 
President Dudayev's authority. 
  Who conceived the next clumsy step is not known. Except that 
on 10 November "in order to prevent mass unrest and to 
confiscate the arms and ammunition in illegal possession of the 
population" troops were brought into Ingushetia. Heavy T-72 
tanks, armored vehicles and paratroops moved on Chechnya in 
great numbers. Yes, Chechnya, because there was, and still is, 
no border between Chechnya and Ingushetia. Chechens from nearby 
villages came out to the road and blocked the highway with 
gasoline trucks; Dudayev declared a state of emergency. There 
was again the smell of big war in the Caucasus. 
  The next day, on 11 November, the Russian Government's 
Acting 
Prime Minister Gaydar signed an agreement with representatives 
of Ingushetia and Chechnya on withdrawal of troops. 
  The idea of "Ingush aggression" was losing attractiveness 
for 
the Russian center. Participation in the Ingush pogrom did not 
bring any glory to Russian arms. Another peacekeeping action 
resulted in great blood and humiliation--not too conspicuous, 
though. The Russian press, with the rare exception, kept an 
organized silence, while the West, not yet interested in this 
incomprehensible Caucasus cauldron, was wary of interfering in 
Russian family affairs. 
  All three "enforcement" ministers--Grachev, Barannikov, and 
Yerin--who arrived a day before at the theater of military 
operations, also departed quietly. Savvin resigned. So did 
Khizha. 
  One could question the motives of Deputy Prime Minister G. 
Khizha's behavior, but his intentions were announced publicly, 
his orders did not diverge from his intentions, and he did not 
even find it necessary to hide his personal affinity toward the 
Ossetian leadership. It is hard to imagine that Khizha could not 
foresee the casualties and destruction stemming from his orders. 
But where experienced generals turned away in disgust, he went 
to the end. The generals he advised to rid themselves of the 
"Tbilisi syndrome." He knew he was answerable only to those who 
had appointed him, and he was right. When the time came, he was 
held to answer both for the dilletantism of Moscow politicians 
and his own zeal. Khizha has disappeared from the political 
horizon.

  [Text] 
<H5>  IV. STRUGGLE FOR PEACE </H5>
  All wars end. So did this one. 
  And peace came. 
  And this peace was new, although its images strangely 
resembled something. 
  At the beginning of summer, at the famous Chermen Circle 
border point, where Ossetians and Ingush come together for 
official meetings and quiet business negotiations, and where 
hostages and information are exchanged, representatives of the 
North Ossetian Ministry of Health transferred to the Ingush 
Ministry of Health under the supervision of specialists from the 
Russian Ministry of Health five patients from the republic 
psychiatric hospital. They were being transferred to, as they 
say, where they belong--all five were Ingush. 
  It was a sunny day; the patients looked well cared for. "We 
took better care of them than of our own," said the chief 
physician from Vladikavkaz. The parties were clearly happy with 
each other, expressing a willingness for a new "dialogue." The 
general atmosphere of complacency was nearly spoiled by patient 
Magomed A. He cried, not wanting to leave behind his hospital 
roommates and the doctors he loved. How could Magomed A. know 
that the impossibility of shared habitation of Ossetian and 
Ingush mental patients was now codified in law by a special 
decree of the North Ossetian parliament? After all, the man is 
mentally ill. 
  During the five-day Ossetian-Ingush war, the Chermen 
boarding 
house for the feeble-minded remained an island of wisdom in the 
crazy slaughter. When normal citizens left the village after 
shooting at each other for a while, the feeble-minded took their 
fate into their own hands, demonstrating an exemplary common 
sense and mutual aid. Dividing people by ethnic origin proved 
beyond what their feeble minds could grasp. That is how the 
Russian military found them upon entering Chermen--all together. 
There is a rumor that this boarding home also is to be 
disbanded--Ossetians to one side, Ingush to the other. 
  And there was not a single person in good mind on that day 
who would look around and ask: What exactly are we all doing 
here? 
  Only a deprived mind can grasp the peace that came. One 
Russian republic defeated by armed force another Russian 
republic. And Russia itself, as if the war was between Nicaragua 
and Guatemala, "forged the victory" for one of them. 
  Ingush in Vladikavkaz and Prigorodnyy Rayon of the North 
Ossetian SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] were partly 
exterminated and completely pushed out, deported beyond the 
borders of Ossetia. The North Ossetian press likes to compare 
the tragic events of last year with the Hitlerite aggression. 
The style of articles and speeches is a matter of taste, but, 
using the suggested analogy, we should extrapolate it to the 
area of practical ideology: In those times, Hitlerites, 
capturing some Soviet cities and burying some of its residents 
in ditches, hung a poster--"Judenfrei," Jew-free. In Ossetia 
they do not hang "Ingush-free" posters, but in a letter to 
IZVESTIYA a well-intentioned female resident of the republic 
writes: "The air in Vladikavkaz has become cleaner without the 
Ingush." 
  Was it that long ago that Ossetian writer-democrat Kosta 
Khetagurov defended the dignity of the mountain 
people--Ossetians and Ingush--from the ignorant snobbishness of 
the bureaucratic press in Vladikavkaz? Now all 33 writers in the 
republic appeal to the people from the pages of SEVERNAYA 
OSETIYA with a proposal to hold a referendum on the topic: 
"Should we or should we not live with Ingush on our land?" The 
engineers of human souls advise--let us not. The organizing 
committee of the second congress of Ossetian people presented an 
ultimatum to the Russian president: "The issue of joint 
habitation of the Ingush with Ossetian people should be removed 
from the agenda... Otherwise the committee reserves the right to 
rouse our people to an armed struggle." 
  And finally the session of the republic's Supreme Soviet 
turned the thesis voiced by the writers into law. The decree of 
the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet on the impossibility of joint 
habitation of Ossetians and Ingush, which has no analogy in 
modern history, with the exception of Nuremberg racist laws 
passed under Hitler, placed every Ingush outside the law on the 
territory of North Ossetia. This prompted the current head of 
the Provisional Administration, V.D. Lozovoy, to appeal to North 
Ossetian deputies: 
  "I have to express my regret that you have not supported the 
proposal to dismiss the ill-conceived thesis of the 
impossibility of joint habitation. I ask you once again to come 
back to it and think again. You represent the proud and wise 
people of your republic. I understand your demand for justice, 
but there is no such thing as two justices, just as there are no 
two truths. There is only one truth. You have today a great 
historic chance to show your wisdom, so that you may later look 
honestly into the eyes of other people and your children, and be 
remembered kindly by your grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
Find in yourself the wisdom and courage to arrive at a just 
solution and place yourself above political expediency in the 
name of and for the good of your people." 
  V.D. Lozovoy found strong and precise words, but they did 
not 
touch the deputies. Perhaps the deputies would have given it a 
thought had they heard such a speech from an all-Russia rostrum, 
but no one delivered it there. In interviews with journalists, 
including foreign ones, A. Galazov does not advertise 
Vladikavkaz laws. He only reminds them that he cannot guarantee 
the safety of Ingush returning to Prigorodnyy Rayon. Buses 
carrying Ingush to four villages within the pale of settlement 
set by the presidential decree are pelted with stones. This is 
how the citizens apply the law of their Supreme Soviet. They are 
not hooligans or thugs, storm troopers or Nazis; they are simply 
doing their public duty. That is why village gatherings on the 
standard topic "No to Joint Habitation!" resemble well-rehearsed 
party meetings. 
  Although things did go too far, and it is indeed easier for 
the Ossetians to live without the Ingush. Blood has been spilled 
by both sides. One hundred five dead Ossetians is a big loss not 
only for their loved ones--it is a perceptible loss for a small 
nation. Bloodshed does not make anybody better. The Ingush also 
nurture an image of Ossetians endowed with inhuman vices. Hate 
is seldom fair; it always goes overboard. A year of such 
peaceful coexistence did not do well by both peoples. 
  All wars end in peace. A make-believe war was followed by a 
make-believe peace. Imaginary, but not bloodless. In the postwar 
year about 100 have been killed from both sides, their murderers 
never found. What it was--terrorism, hooliganism, revenge, 
provocation, robbery--who knows? 
  And with all the effort that went into strengthening peace. 
All those people who tried over the past year to reconcile the 
Ossetians and the Ingush--elders, women, religious figures, 
Kirsan Ilyumzhanov, people's diplomacy and regular diplomats; 
even the Confederation of Mountain Nations, having had enough of 
fighting in Abkhazia, was ready to don "blue papakhas"; and now 
finally President Yeltsin. 
  All to no avail. 
  I will permit myself to share a personal impression, since I 
was present at the beginning of the Pyatigorsk-Kislovodsk 
process conceived two and a half months after the tragedy by the 
chairman of the Chamber of Nationalities, R. Abdulatipov, and S. 
Shakhray (State Committee for Nationalities and Federation 
Affairs) under the umbrella of the Senega Forum social movement. 
One expected a gathering of wise, experienced people from 
different North Caucasus republics, who had accumulated 
historical experience of joint habitation; people who 
undoubtedly had things to say, who knew how to make peace 
between two peoples and organize their living together. The 
result of this formal undertaking were two meetings: one for 
everybody in Pyatigorsk, with short speeches by representatives 
of social movements in the Caucasus; and another, the next day, 
in a posh Kislovodsk hotel behind closed doors, and only for top 
republic officials. At such forums the only outstanding feature 
usually is the banquet. Besides, the troubles of the two people 
were so close to the door that our gluttony looked like a feast 
amidst plague. 
  At the next meeting in March (this time without any kind of 
public representatives), the Kislovodsk agreements were adopted 
under the ambiguous heading "Agreement on Measures for a 
Comprehensive Solution of the Problem of Refugees and Forced 
Migrants on the territory of Ingush Republic and North Ossetian 
SSR." 
  It soon became clear, of course, that Ruslan Aushev's 
understanding of "comprehensive solution" was full-scale 
resettling assistance to Ingush refugees; while Akhsarbek 
Galazov, on the contrary, saw it as inclusion in the number of 
refugees of everyone who had come to North Ossetia: from South 
Ossetia, Georgia, and Tajikistan; Cossacks from Chechnya and 
Ingushetia; Meskhet Turks from Central Asia; and others. For 
these refugees Moscow provided substantial amounts of money. S. 
Khetagurov, chairman of the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet, 
reported to his compatriots with satisfaction: "We have received 
a nice infusion." 
  The obvious military inequality of the sides found 
continuation in the obvious diplomatic superiority of the 
Vladikavkaz team. Legends abound among the Ingush regarding the 
powerful Ossetian lobby in Moscow. From circles close to the 
Ingush Republic leadership comes a tale of an incredible event. 
An edict (No. 407) was signed by the president of the Russian 
Federation; Point 4 envisaged the transfer of all power on a 
territory where a state of emergency is imposed to the 
Provisional Administration, that is, in essence it introduced 
federal rule; the decree had a cover letter to the parliament 
attached with a request for approval, and--behold the miracle: 
While the decree was en route from the Kremlin to the White 
House, Point 4 disappeared; the signed decree had a completely 
different point. And everything in Prigorodnyy Rayon remained as 
it was. 
  "I am not a politician yet--I am only learning," says Aushev 
about himself. "I have one advantage over many politicians--I do 
not hold onto power. I do not need it. I have had enough 
battles, enough of giving orders; I have had enough power for 
several lives to come..." Aushev had also, however, learned a 
few lessons, and his next steps were more cautious. As to 
decisiveness, he had always had plenty of that--suffice it to 
recall his resignation from the job of deputy head of the 
Provisional Administration in charge of Ingushetia. Is it that 
he did not get along with Shakhray? "No," said Aushev. "Shakhray 
is an intelligent and competent man, but there is nothing to get 
along about--the problems are not being dealt with." He said 
that and flew back to Moscow. The Ingush, however, did not let 
him go and elected him the first president of their 
first--tentative as it was--state. One wants to believe that in 
the process of learning to be a politician Aushev will not learn 
too much, as others do, and will not suppress his 
straightforward and honest self; and anyway, if he becomes more 
"sophisticated," he will not be understood by his people, who 
also have only one advantage: Having never had their own state, 
they have not yet been washed out in the lye of our developed 
socialism. 
  Aushev, a professional military man, needs peace; he needs 
to 
give his people a breather, give them back a taste for life. The 
ceremonial combination of the words "struggle for peace" has 
real meaning for Ingushetia. 
  It looks as though V. Polyanichko learned something in the 
zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. This is a rather 
subjective feeling, and I have no way of verifying it: I was 
probably one of the last journalists to talk to him. On Saturday 
he invited me to visit him in Vladikavkaz at the beginning of 
the following week, so that we could have a more detailed 
conversation, but on Sunday he was killed. His murderers have 
not been found (although the opportunity to do so was there); 
there are different versions, including one that Polyanichko got 
curious in Vladikavkaz about machinations with nonferrous metals 
and sales abroad. This version recently got into the press and, 
as I hear it, caused considerable interest in Vladikavkaz; I 
will refrain from guesswork, however. It is a fact that he did 
get involved in the Ingush problem, however, and over the short 
period in his job as the head of the Provisional Administration 
he succeeded in making perceptible progress. The most important 
of his accomplishments was that, having studied the issue, he 
reported to the president, and the latter for the first 
time--and in presence of others, at that--had a tough 
conversation with Galazov. After that came a joint appeal of 
President B.N. Yeltsin and Chairman of the Council of Ministers 
V.S. Chernomyrdin to the peoples of North Ossetia and 
Ingushetia, urging them to show mutual generosity, restore 
good-neighbor relations, and engage in constructive 
peace-building work. 
  On Saturday 31 July an emergency congress of peoples of 
Ingushetia was held in Nazran. Polyanichko apparently was a 
little late; he found a place, unnoticed, somewhere in the back 
row. He did not speak, just listened. When everybody rose, 
however, it was no longer possible not to notice him--his height 
and bearing were truly of a general's proportions. He was 
satisfied with the congress, and although there had been some 
rather scathing speeches, it looked like a burden had been taken 
off him--perhaps he had been told something and expected worse. 
Not knowing that I had visited these parts before, he started 
telling me not to worry, that everything was going in the right 
direction, the people here were good, they understood everything 
correctly. It was then that he said a phrase I quoted in my 
current report from Nazran--that the Ingush unfortunately keep 
looking back too much on their ill-starred fate, but one cannot 
go forward while looking back. I detected in his words (partly 
to my surprise, because Polyanichko's reputation in our circles 
was not the greatest) ordinary empathy, the desire to do 
something for these people. 
  He actually was already doing something, even set up a 
foundation for refugee assistance, and firmly supported their 
return to their places of previous habitation. On Tuesday a 
meeting of a joint commission was scheduled in the Kabarda city 
of Terek; the parties were to approve the choice of four 
villages in Prigorodnyy Rayon to which Ingush would return 
first. The meeting took place, but this was another stalling 
maneuver. His death delayed the choice of these four villages by 
half a year--they were named only in December, after B.N. 
Yeltsin's trip to North Caucasus. But to name does not mean to 
implement. Polyanichko was a doer. Colleagues in the Provisional 
Administration remember him as a very strong, tough, courageous, 
but also kind man. They remember his words, phrases. 
Correspondents once asked him under what circumstances he could 
order the troops to open fire, and he said: "Only in a salute!" 
He once said to someone: "The people are smarter than all the 
governments and administrations...". 
  But these are the words of a man who decided to listen to 
the 
people not only at rallies. Now rural gatherings are taking 
place in North Ossetia; they protest President Yeltsin's decree 
on returning Ingush refugees, for starters, to four population 
centers in Prigorodnyy Rayon. Among the counterarguments 
presented by the "people": first issue an official opinion on 
the aggression, and find and convict the murderers. But, as 
gathering organizers know very well, we are talking about the 
first 15,000 persons "vetted" by the procuracy and commissions; 
there are no criminals among them. Which means that perhaps the 
problem lies elsewhere? 
  Of course, the truth about the armed conflict is needed. One 
of the reasons it is slow in coming is surely not the main 
one--how to tell it without insulting either side; first they 
want to smooth it out, average it, squeeze into the framework of 
interethnic conflicts... But in any case, to make the everyday 
existence of 64,000 people, predominantly children, contingent 
on making this assessment public is both heartless, economically 
inexpedient, and simply absurd. 
  Everything came to the fore during B.N. Yeltsin's trip. 
Pressure, bargaining. You leave us Prigorodnyy Rayon, and we 
will return your people there in a measured way. But bargaining 
is bargaining; the more desirable way it is to do it within the 
framework of the law, and this is what is nowhere to be found. 
  All wars leave winners and losers. This war does not have 
any 
winners; there is only one winner--Akhsarbek Galazov. 
  Of course, the time will come when the Ossetian people will 
give him his due, but time not only comes--it passes; this is 
what he is counting on. 
  Two months before the armed conflict the anti-Galazov 
opposition appealed to the president of Russia to "look in 
detail not only into the political situation but also into facts 
of intentional exacerbation of interethnic tensions, and to 
monitor the use of finances directed by the Russian government 
to North Ossetia." People familiar with the political kitchen in 
Vladikavkaz warned: "In North Ossetia the split between the 
corrupt, amoral, and thieving authorities, on one side, and the 
people on the other already occurred a long time ago..." 
  Where is this opposition now? Meanwhile, Galazov was first 
proclaimed "man of the year" in North Ossetia, and has now been 
elected the first president of the republic. The democratic 
opposition to the regime fell silent and, in order not to be 
accused of betraying the nation, either stepped aside or merged 
with the authorities in a single national-patriotic impulse. In 
the list of results of the five-day war in Prigorodnyy Rayon 
this may be arguably the most important one. 
  It is not enough, however, to win over the opposition. A. 
Galazov's genetic memory prompts him with words worthy of 
Stalin: "Organs of internal affairs and state security should 
conduct a resolute struggle against provocateurs and whisperers 
of all suits and colorations." In short, the opposition is 
threatened with Kolyma. 
  Of course, it is hard to understand: Ossetia has always been 
distinguished by its intelligentsia, and Ossetians are 
justifiably proud of the many names that have brought fame not 
only to the little republic but to all Russia as well. It is not 
hard, however, to deceive the intelligentsia, because it is 
happy to deceive itself. And it is not necessary to look for 
examples abroad of how entire nations have been deceived by 
false ideology and the propaganda serving it. What about us, in 
the entire former Union--was it long ago that we awoke? And 
could we hear the voice of Sakharov if we still had the beat of 
military bands and television and newspapers reporting daily 
that the enemy is right on our doorstep? 
  There are, however, arguments no music can drown--the 
economy. Perhaps despite all the denunciations North Ossetia is 
flourishing under Galazov, and the regime, no matter how bad it 
smells to the opposition and merely decent people, nevertheless 
is providing a carefree life for its citizens, and for 
Russia--considerable revenue for its treasury? Let us not touch 
on the carefree life now--this is a topic for a separate 
conversation; regarding revenue for the treasury, though, there 
are indeed precise quantitative data. In one of the June issues 
last year SEGODNYA published an interesting table of differences 
between the amount of federal taxes and the total subsidies 
issued to the regions in per capita figures. With the exception 
of the Republic of Komi, North Ossetia received more than 
anybody else from the common treasury last year and contributed 
the least to it. To show more graphically how big this hole in 
the federal pocket is, it should also be pointed out that all of 
them together--Tuva, Tatarstan, Dagestan, Kalmykia, Karelia, 
Buryatia, Sakha-Yakutia, Mari El, Kabardino-Balkaria, Bashkiria, 
Chechnya, and Ingushetia plus Kamchatka and Irkutsk Oblast--made 
less of a dent in Russia's kitty than this one little republic 
in the North Caucasus. In a certain sense it is we, the Russian 
taxpayers, that armed this region in such a fashion that in 
terms of quantity of military hardware per capita it has no 
equal in the world. It is you and I who paid for the murder of 
each Ossetian and each Ingush who died in the senseless and 
historically futile conflict. 
  One must give Galazov his due. To stand for his convictions 
is not his motto. Galazov is a successful and pragmatic 
politician. 
  He always remembers his goal. He may, of course, guess 
wrong, 
shoot himself in the foot occasionally--the style of inertia is 
still great, but he will shake it up, will try to forget, and 
will try to make others forget--and those who should forget, do; 
the rest of them do not matter. 
  Just look at how he has managed to complicate the already 
complex problem of refugees by packaging it with words like 
"phased," "through nonviolent means," "comprehensive," "places 
of compact habitation." How many obstacles did he erect--but 
they are still coming back. Life goes on. There are already 
2,500 Ingush living in Chermen, and 1,500 in Kartsa, right next 
to Vladikavkaz. Spontaneously, without waiting for the 
negotiations to be completed, 10,000 persons returned to their 
burned homes. It is this simple invincibility of life that 
Galazov did not take into account, and so he began to fall 
behind. And one can no longer say that he is not behind the 
events in politics, too, considering that in Vladikavkaz during 
the days of the anniversary of the tragic events all the talk 
was about heroic deeds, glory, the readiness to deflect another 
aggression, while Nazran during the same memorial days did not 
forget to say words of gratitude to Ossetian neighbors who saved 
Ingush families in their homes--and there were hundreds of such 
incidents; it is a pity that the names of these people still 
cannot be said openly in Vladikavkaz. Because they (not "compact 
resettlement") are the hope; they are the true victory of life 
over enmity.

IZVESTIYA: "War and Peace in Prigorodnyy Rayon"] 
  [Text] V. COLD SPOT 
  Protection of the lives and rights of citizens--whether they 
are Ingush or Ossetians--is the meaning and purpose of the 
Provisional Administration's existence. That is the reason the 
state of emergency was imposed in the zone of conflict. The 
Russian Federation law on the state of emergency envisages a 
special form of rule on the territory where it is in effect. 
Compliance with the law, by the way, would have made all 
arguments regarding the introduction of federal rule in 
Prigorodnyy Rayon completely superfluous--it had already been 
envisaged by the law on the state of emergency but for the 
president's decree of 4 November 1991. In keeping with this 
decree, which amended the previous one issued a day before, a 
Provisional Administration essentially was deprived of 
administrative rights on the territory of North Ossetia, that 
is, in the zone of conflict. Old and new laws of the North 
Ossetian SSR remained in effect there and new countless decrees 
were adopted that were at sharp odds with a stabilization of the 
situation; all executive authority--formally subordinated to the 
Provisional Administration but in essence openly ignoring 
it--remained in place. The Ossetian militia, OMON [Special 
Designation Militia Detachments], and republican guard continued 
to operate in Prigorodnyy Rayon villages. 
  Given the circumstances, the Provisional Administration, in 
order to protect the lives of the same Ingush, had to order the 
troops subordinate to it not to let them back into the territory 
of Prigorodnyy Rayon. An absurd situation developed: Russian 
troops and representatives of the federal authorities, even in 
the rank of deputy prime minister, found themselves in the role 
of executors of the shameful decree of the North Ossetian 
parliament! 
  Any Ossetian--be he an honest man or a marauder--has a right 
to visit Prigorodnyy Rayon villages without asking anybody's 
permission. There is now nothing to loot from the burned Ingush 
homes--there had been more than 3,000 of them there, so now they 
are stripping them of radiators and toilets and taking bricks 
out of the walls. An Ingush cannot approach his former home 
unless he puts his name on a list a week in advance; then he 
will be checked out somewhere, vetted; he will be put on a bus 
and, escorted by an APC [armored personnel vehicle] with 
soldiers, he will embark on a dangerous journey--there have been 
instances when entire busloads were taken hostage, buses pelted 
by stones, passengers pulled out and beaten. What kind of 
protection can five young frightened escorts provide against 30 
hardened commandos? 
  In these circumstances, the very existence of the 
Provisional 
Administration becomes meaningless. The first law of an 
administrative system: The less the expected result, the greater 
the number of bureaucrats that will vie for the job. For this 
reason the Provisional Administration staff is growing 
continuously: It looks as if now there is a plan to increase it 
by another 600 persons. Cozy Vladikavkaz, where most of the 
Moscow functionaries on detached assignment are quartered, 
should be considered a warm rather than hot spot. The Ossetian 
authorities assiduously keep an eye on them and reward the 
zealous. One would consider it a joke--who would believe in such 
an open bribe--had it not been for the testimony of an Ossetian 
newspaper: "Over seven and a half months of 1993, on the orders 
of the North Ossetian SSR MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], 
268 servicemen in regular military and operational-investigative 
groups received bonuses totaling 6.52 million rubles." 
  The investigative groups are a special topic. Hundreds of 
killed and missing (there are still more than 300 persons 
officially listed as such in Ingushetia); unburied corpses of 
relatives barely covered with dirt; teenagers with wild eyes; 
fathers of former families dying in strangers' beds--the very 
smoke of the Nazran hearths has the persistent aftertaste of 
suffering and crime. And how many convictions have we seen? But 
this is not the point right now. Life goes on; it requires 
settling in and orderliness. The republic may have been created 
"on paper," but its citizens are living people and they present 
the Provisional Administration with conventional everyday 
problems, which it does not resolve. Why? 
  For the second year Ingushetia is essentially living under a 
blockade. Rail cargo with humanitarian aid and acutely needed 
items travels as far as Beslan station (North Ossetia); neither 
the Provisional Administration nor the troops subordinate to it 
can ensure the further movement of the cargo, to Ingushetia 
(there are only six kilometers to the next--Ingush--station of 
Dalakovo). Because of this one six-kilometer segment on the 
territory of North Ossetia, cargo has to be routed circuitously 
through Astrakhan. How many soldiers does one need to escort 
cargo from Beslan station to Ingushetia? In the name of what 
then do we keep such a huge and costly army contingent here? 
  The state has allocated billions for resettlement of 
refugees. This money does not go to displaced Ingush, and the 
authorities even explain why. First, the money is not being 
invested in reconstruction; second, the money is designated not 
for Ingush refugees but for "finding a comprehensive solution to 
the refugee problem" (this is the way it is worded in those 
certain Kislovodsk agreements). And one must admit that this is 
a correct answer. The Ingush cannot invest money in 
reconstruction because they are not permitted to get to their 
ruined homes, not to mention making construction materials 
available and the mechanism of arranging all of this. 
  This can only be explained by the fact that the head of the 
Provisional Administration, no matter what his personal 
qualities may be, is limited in his actions and can do very 
little. Perhaps it is for this reason that administration heads 
here are rotated rather quickly. There have been seven of them 
in one year. And almost all, like General Filatov in his time, 
followed the "text" written for them by Galazov. 
  How many hopes were pinned on Shakhray, and in fact he did 
everything in the beginning to make himself different from his 
predecessor G. Khizha. In Vladikavkaz he lived on the territory 
of an army military school, wore the uniform of a Russian 
paratroop officer, ate in the soldiers mess; in Nazran, where 
there was no hotel, a written-off passenger train was put on a 
spare truck to house the visiting officials; Shakhray occupied 
one economy-class compartment. 
  Unlike Khizha, who, as is known, never crossed the border of 
Ingushetia, three days after his arrival, on 17 November, 
Shakhray spoke at the square in Nazran. He did not promise quick 
prosperity to anyone, but did guarantee on behalf of the 
Provisional Administration the return of the Ingush to the 
locales of their old compact habitation in Prigorodnyy Rayon. 
This will be difficult to accomplish, however, he warned, as 
long as illegitimate units on the territory of North Ossetia are 
not disarmed. 
  Two weeks later, however, he spoke just as convincingly at a 
briefing in Vladikavkaz: "These are existing units. By the 
decision of the North Ossetian government, which is supported by 
the Provisional Administration, careful registration of 
armaments, fighting vehicles, and personnel of these units is 
being conducted." 
  "This is not a contradiction--this is dialectics," Shakhray 
told journalists. Yes, obviously he did not learn dialectics 
from Hegel. While still in Vladikavkaz, he began to look 
differently at Ingush refugees as well: "We will deal with the 
refugee problem in a comprehensive manner--after all, this 
category includes Ingush, Ossetians, and Russians leaving 
Ingushetia and Chechnya." As if during the five-day war the 
people squeezed out of Prigorodnyy Rayon amidst bloodshed were 
not Ingush but citizens of Georgia or Uzbekistan. As to 
Cossacks--or, to be precise, Russians (Russians in the North 
Caucasus, much as in other republics, are a separate problem), 
they are presented as an unending stream of refugees into North 
Ossetia, although according to the data of North Ossetia's own 
migration service, 473 Russians arrived in the republic, and 
there is no report as to how many left. For those still there, a 
Potemkin village is being built near Vladikavkaz. 
  S. Shakhray's second invention after the "comprehensive 
solution" was the notation in the labor service record of 
deported Ingush: "Let go by mutual agreement of the parties." 
The mocking meaning of this notation is obvious, although 
perhaps the author saw it as a compromise. 
  Is it perhaps the air in Vladikavkaz that has such a 
powerful 
influence on Russian governor-generals? Among the next five 
teams there were no more volunteers to follow Shakhray's example 
and eat in the soldiers mess or sleep on a hard bench in a 
railcar in Nazran. By the spring, investigators from the 
combined group of the Russian Federation procuracy, MB [Ministry 
of Security], and MVD, who stayed longer than the others, had 
left the Ingush capital. And by the summer there was no longer 
any need for the hotel on wheels--the train literally left the 
station. And with it the last hopes of deported people that the 
Provisional Administration will take care of them. 
  Already in Moscow, in interview to IZVESTIYA (10 January) 
Shakhray put forward a far-reaching thought: "Our state has been 
weakened, and in a weak state the primacy of formal law cannot 
be maintained." Well, then, of course... 
  In Vladikavkaz (not in Nazran!) Shakhray confided to his 
listeners that he himself is a Terek Cossack from nearby parts. 
In the course of the election campaign he visited Cossack parts 
hunting for votes and promised that the south of Russia would 
become a special border region of the country and the Cossacks 
(as it was in the last century--I.D.) would have an occupation 
there. In return he received the rank of colonel and a Cossack 
outfit. Well, he had already worn paratroop fatigues; now is 
just the right time to put on a Cossack masquerade suit. One can 
only hope that Sergey Mikhaylovich will be tactful enough not to 
pin on a couple of St. George's crosses for settling the 
Ossetian-Ingush conflict. 
  But how did it indeed happen that the "winners" grabbed so 
much power, thereby creating a problem that transcends even the 
boundaries of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict? They refuse to 
recognize Russian laws on the territory of their republic, 
refuse negotiations as a method of settling political conflicts. 
The unprecedented dependence of Vladikavkaz on the Federation 
provided the latter with the means to use power without using 
force, by explaining to the Ossetian leadership the ruinous 
consequences of lawless arbitrariness for the republic and its 
leadership. Or a direct appeal could be made to the deceived 
Ossetian people. 
  At the time, a year ago, a different approach was chosen. 
Perhaps because, seen from Moscow, Dudayev looked like an even 
greater danger for the Russian great power. By the way, it is 
quite possible that Dudayev himself was ready then for a 
deep-reaching compromise, but the Cossack ideology proved 
stronger than common sense. And Nazran became a point of cold 
calculation on the map of Russian politics. 
  Every political scientist and specialist on conflicts knows 
what to do in the hot spots of the planet. Nobody truly knows 
what to do in the cold spot of Russia. Attempts to pass crude 
indulgence of regional power-grabbers or great-power dilettantes 
in the capital for ethno-political research have the potential 
of reviving old enmities stretching back eons. There are three 
viewpoints of people who have a tremendous stake in the future 
of the zone of conflict. 
  One belongs to President of the Ingush Republic Ruslan 
Aushev. He believes that it is necessary to impose to the 
fullest extent a state of emergency on the territory of 
Prigorodnyy Rayon where Ossetians and Ingush lived together. The 
state of emergency should be lifted in the rest of North 
Ossetia, including Vladikavkaz, as well as on the territory of 
Ingushetia. In the zone of conflict all authority should rest 
with the Provisional Administration. All military units 
controlled by Ossetian and Ingush authorities should be 
withdrawn from the territory of the conflict and subsequently 
disarmed and disbanded. Illegal possession of arms must be 
punished in keeping with the provisions of the law on the state 
of emergency in the Russian Federation. Use of arms must be 
stopped by force. The entire law enforcement system is recruited 
from among citizens who are not residents of the North Caucasus. 
Economic aid and financial means received for the reconstruction 
of the territory are placed at the disposal of the Provisional 
Administration, distributed by it, and invested under its 
supervision. Let a commandant appointed to every population 
center have elected deputies from the two communities. In all 
other respects people should live normal lives. Let them rebuild 
their homes, plant the fields, and harvest the crops; as time 
passes, they will get used to each other and, God willing, will 
not fall for new deceptions. 
  Another viewpoint belongs to the Ossetian leadership and is 
well known: "No" to joint habitation of Ossetians and Ingush. 
This idea is being imposed on the Ossetian people and is 
supported by the majority--at least publicly. If economic and 
political freedom develops in Russia, this solution to the 
problem will not find support in either Ossetia, Ingushetia, or 
any other Russian region. 
  But then perhaps we will have to accept the third viewpoint 
put forward in the president's edict: a phased return--first to 
four population centers in the state of emergency zone--of 
Ingush refugees. For the time being, while the state of 
emergency is in effect, the legal status of the territory 
remains unchanged. 
  There are perhaps other ways to untie this tight knot. The 
only thing that is mandatory is honest intentions and a benign 
attitude to the interests of each party. While striving for 
fairness for the Ingush we cannot forget, of course, that 
generations of Ossetians already have been raised in Prigorodnyy 
Rayon, for whom it is also the only home they know. 
  For the time being, however, the president's edict does not 
fully satisfy either side. Why, Issa Kostoyev asks, can the 
Ingush return to four villages, not three or seven? This means 
that in some villages there will be one kind of state of 
emergency, and in others--a different one. 
  Galazov recently reassured citizens of North Ossetia: 
"Please 
do not be afraid! The president of the Russian Federation's 
edict is not the first edict... We will find a way to resist any 
force." 
  And he found it! 
  The paper that emerged a few days ago from the bowels of the 
State Committee on Nationalities and has already been signed by 
the prime minister instructs the agencies in Ossetia and 
Ingushetia to prepare recommendations for repealing Articles 3 
and 6 of the Law "On Rehabilitation of Peoples Subjected to 
Repressions;" second, it assigns the task of protecting Ingush 
refugees returning to the four villages in Prigorodnyy Rayon to 
the Russian MVD jointly with the Prigorodnyy Rayon 
law enforcement organs. The way we read this is that protection 
of the Ingush again is placed in the hands of those who had been 
killing them. In the said paper is Russian Federation Prime 
Minister V. Chernomyrdin's List of Assignments stemming from the 
Nalchik agreements. How easily our state disposes of the life 
and fate of hundreds of thousands of people--actually, the fate 
of its own nation and its historic choice. What 
simple--sometimes most simplistic--motivation do they offer for 
a political step that should have been discussed before it is 
made. 
  There is no doubt that Russia has the right to protect 
itself 
from disintegration. But we always choose to travel the 
unexplored path... right next to the highway. Are we the first 
and only ones in the world, or even in our own history? Had 
there not been within the boundaries of the Russian empire a 
Bukhara Emirate, a Khivan Khanate, the Polish Kingdom, and the 
Great Principality of Finland, with their own emirs, khans, 
sejms, parliaments, and even their own currency? 
  It seems as if we are afraid that unless we show force we 
will have the reputation of being powerless. Actually, what 
Russia deserves is wary caution because of its erratic national 
policy. We alternately jump to defend to death our dear 
Tiraspol, blockade Chechnya, rouse the Cossacks and OMON against 
"persons of Caucasus origin," indulge nationalist leaders, or 
bring our great-power wrath on entire nations. We behave 
differently in identical situations, prompting others to suspect 
us of a double-play. And it does not occur to anyone that we, a 
great power, are simply standing there scratching our head. All 
the ethnic policy concepts authored by amateurs that have we 
seen by now. Ethnic policy cannot be made a subject of 
dilettante experiments if Russia wants to remain part of the 
family of civilized nations. Otherwise we are not in danger of a 
Yugoslav version. We are in danger of something much worse. 
  No, while Russia is weak, the law should be especially 
strong. Otherwise power will shift into the hands of flexible 
jurists or sons of jurists. 
  *** 
  We are being made to learn, small step by small step, sip by 
sip. They let us try it. It tastes bitter? Well, there is not 
much we can do about it, they tell us. It tastes bitter to 
everyone. 
  When in Tbilisi soldiers chopped down 19 persons with their 
spades, the entire country lamented; the Congress of USSR 
People's Deputies interrogated Kryuchkov and Ligachev, Yazov and 
Shevardnadze. Commissions flew to Tbilisi one after the other; 
the issue of a Leningrad newspaper with Sobchak's report in it 
was passed around. Then there was Baku and Vilnius; then 
bombed-out Ingush homes in Prigorodnyy Rayon, hundreds dead. 
Where are the writers and composers, cinematographers and 
deputies now? Where is Anatoliy Sobchak? General Aushev says 
bitterly that had something like this happened in the Baltics, 
the whole world would be in an uproar. The Caucasus for this 
world is the East, and in the East people are counted in the 
millions. 
  The Tbilisi syndrome has finally been overcome. Now the 
military doctrine of the Russian Federation envisages bringing 
in military formations to aid MVD troops. Now the army has 
become a no longer hidden element of politics. And the 
generals--political figures of substantial weight. How long will 
they continue to patiently pull smoldering wood from the fire 
just to light someone's cigarette, and will they not decide to 
start their own perestroyka? Whom will we then call on for help? 
On the other hand, the military that stays outside politics is a 
remnant of Sakharov-era illusions. 
  The military has been used many times by politicians against 
one another, and has increasingly often undertaken independent 
actions either with the consent of the political leadership or 
moved by its own sympathies--or rather antipathies. The Dniester 
region, Abkhazia, Ingushetia. Who knows what was sanctioned here 
by the warring branches of authority, and what by the inner 
convictions of some general? 
  Pogroms against "persons of Caucasus origins," promised by 
national-patriots, were for the first time accomplished in an 
organized form in Ingushetia. I will not try to guess who gave 
the pogrom perpetrators absolution in advance. I only know that 
nobody will harm them. We are being made to become accustomed to 
many things, and there are many we have already grown used to. 
  We felt it acutely in Moscow in the beginning of October, 
with its deceived crowds and tanks in the streets. And even more 
acutely during the days of our all-Russia election mutiny. It 
turned out that we did not know anything about our country, 
ourselves, our people. We were being warned of a social 
explosion, and we visualized smashed street kiosks and display 
windows of hard currency stores. But the senseless Russian 
mutiny occurred quietly, in election booths. We have been 
getting used to fascism for a long time for fear of being scared 
by it. And so we did not notice, or did not want to notice the 
first ethnic cleansing successfully carried out a year ago on 
the territory of Russia, the first Russian republic that made 
ethnic intolerance its official policy, and Russians protecting 
themselves from the Russian army. A year later we had all this 
in Moscow: Russians protecting themselves from the Russian army, 
and the ethnic cleansing of the capital. 
  What used to be shameful nowadays at best elicits a shrug. 
But we are people of extremes. Every time we reject the old 
world, we smash our possessions into dust. In rejecting the 
Pharisean Stalinist "friendship of peoples" we should not 
rehabilitate Hitler's racism. The Nuremberg Tribunal's rulings 
remain in force.

<F P=106> [Report by Khabarovsk Kray Statistical Administration: "What </F>
We Import and What We Export"] 
  [Text] Our kray, alas, is an importing territory. That is, 
we import the majority of our consumer goods. Foodstuffs 
predominate in the structure of these imports: They account for 
60 percent of the overall volume of goods received. If 
visualized the picture would look as follows: 


                         Foodstuffs                Nonfoodstuffs 

From krays and oblasts   94.2                      87.7 
of Russia 

From CIS countries       1.8                       1.7 

From imports             4                         10.6 


  Among the foodstuffs imported to the kray during the past 
nine months were vegetable oil--1,085 tonnes (incidentally, this 
is a 2.6-fold reduction compared to the corresponding period of 
last year), and, correspondingly, sugar--7,551 tonnes 
(2.3-fold), tea--125 tonnes (4.8-fold), macaroni items--465 
tonnes (1.1-fold), confectionery items 115 tonnes (1.7-fold), 
and canned fruits and vegetables--14,726 thousands of standard 
cans (1.5-fold). 
  The main suppliers of fruit and vegetable products are 
Uzbekistan and Ukraine. They account for 80 percent of the 
fruits and vegetables. 
  The majority of fabrics, clothing, footwear, goods for 
cultural and domestic purposes and household use, haberdashery, 
and tobacco items are shipped in from krays and oblasts of 
Russia. Thus, for example, 99.5 percent of the silk fabrics, all 
of the deliveries of linen fabrics, 76 percent of the sewn 
items, 98 percent of the knitted items, and 88 percent of the 
leather footwear come from Russian these particular krays and 
oblasts. 
  The kray ships in from the CIS countries such goods as light 
bulbs from Kyrgyzstan, rugs and carpet items from Belarus, 
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, refrigerators from Azerbaijan, and 
cameras and motorcycles from Belarus. 
  Imports from other countries include mainly industrially 
processed food products, light industry goods, tobacco items, 
and alcoholic beverages. 
  But foodstuffs are also shipped out of Khabarovsk Kray to 
other regions. These are industrially processed food products. 
Food deliveries to Russia constitute 99.6 percent of the overall 
volume of exports of foodstuffs out of the kray. They include 
macaroni and confectionery items, margarine products, flour, 
cereals, fish products, nonalcoholic beverages, beer, and 
champagne. 
  Of the nonfoodstuffs the kray delivers sewn items, knitwear, 
leather footwear, furs, furniture, enamel and zinc-plated 
dishware, detergents, and also goods for cultural and domestic 
purposes and household use as well as haberdashery. 
  We export confectionery items, goods for cultural and 
domestic purposes and household use, and detergents.

<F P=106> [Report by Magadan Oblast Statistics Administration: "The </F>
Economic and Social Development of Magadan Oblast for Nine 
Months of 1993"] 
  [Text] The results of nine months of this year 
indicate a further exacerbation of the economic situation in the 
oblast. The economic reforms that are being conducted are still 
not having the necessary effect either on the sphere of turnover 
or on the development of production in all branches of the 
economy. 
<H5>  Privatization and Destatization of the Economy </H5>
  The most widespread method of privatization is sale by 
commercial competition and auction. The prevailing sale price 
exceeds the initial one by a factor of 15. 
  The number of enterprises that have changed form of 
ownership 
through the auction method is growing. Twenty-eight such 
enterprises were counted in the oblast on 1 September; of these, 
10 chose the first variant of privileges, 17--the second, and 
1--the third. The size of authorized capital of joint-stock 
companies totals 1.44 billion rubles [R]. 
  In the structure of privatized enterprises, enterprises in 
trade (46 percent), everyday services (22 percent), and public 
catering (9 percent) predominate. 
  As before, the oblast center leads in the number of 
privatized facilities in the oblast (93 enterprises), followed 
by Yagodninskiy, Tenkinskiy, and Susumanskiy Rayons. 
  According to the status on 1 October, eight enterprises were 
privatized in industry: the Khasynskiy Building Materials Plant, 
Central Lespromkhoz, the AO [joint-stock company] Idyeya, 100 
NKhP [petrochemical enterprise]--Magadan, the sausage factory, 
the Sever-Evenskiy Fish Plant, Vtorchermet [state trust for the 
preparation and processing of scrap nonferrous metals], and the 
AO Magadanenergo [Magadan Power]. 
  In a number of rayons, work on the establishment of peasant 
(farmer) units has become somewhat more brisk. By 1 October in 
the oblast they numbered 317, with a land area of 2,544,000 
hectares, Of these, 304 farms are engaged in livestock raising 
and plant growing. 
  In nine months of this year, 9,100 apartments with a total 
area of 410,000 square meters were privatized in the oblast at a 
cost of R473 million, 9 percent of these in September. In the 
period that has passed, more than 5,200 applications to conduct 
privatization were filed. In comparison with nine months of last 
year, the extent of privatization in the oblast increased by a 
factor of 2.7. This is associated with activation of the process 
of privatization in the city of Magadan. 
<H5>  Finances and Monetary Circulation </H5>
  Enterprises and organizations of the oblast received profits 
of 71.9 billion rubles [R] in January-August of this year. 
Enterprises of the state sector get 99 percent of all profits, 
and its main part--R60.5 billion (84 percent) is received by 
industrial enterprises. 
  The measures being undertaken to stabilize the national 
economy will not lead the economy of the oblast out of the spin 
of the "inflationary spiral." 
  As before, a large number of unprofitable and costly 
enterprises are functioning. At the beginning of September their 
share was 39 percent on average for the national economy; 
however, it was significantly higher in individual branches: in 
everyday services for the population--75 percent, trade--57 
percent, communications--46 percent. The overall total of 
financial losses reached R6 billion. 
  The continuing nonpayments crisis is complicating the 
financial situation of enterprises. Nonpayments to suppliers in 
industrial and construction enterprises amounted to R47.2 
billion, increasing in August by 12 percent, the indebtedness of 
purchasers--by R111.8 billion (38 percent). 
<H5>  Price and Wage Rate Indices </H5>
  The increase in prices continued in January-September of 
this 
year. Consumer prices for goods and services in this period grew 
by a factor of 24.8. The rates of increase in consumer prices 
for the quarter on the average amounted to: January-March--21.1 
percent, April-June--23.5 percent, and July-September--33.2 
percent. 
  The highest rate in price increases occurred in paid 
services 
rendered to the population. Since the beginning of the year, 
prices and wage rates for services requiring payment grew by a 
factor of 113.8, which exceeds the rate of increase of consumer 
prices for all goods by a factor of 16.7. The most significant 
increase in prices occurred in: apartment rent in buildings of 
the state housing fund (by a factor of 525.3), dormitory rent 
(by a factor of 131.9), services of a legal nature (by a factor 
of 377.4), public bath and shower services (by a factor of 
175.7), services for the maintenance of children in preschool 
institutions (by a factor of 51.8), intercity telephone 
communications (by a factor of 31.1), and the cost of concert 
tickets (by a factor of 28.5). Everyday services since the 
beginning of the year increased in price by a factor of 25.5. 
  Consumer prices for all consumer goods increased since the 
beginning of the year by a factor of 6.8, and in September, 31.8 
percent. In the commodity group structure, consumer prices for 
food products have a higher rate of growth. The average monthly 
rate of price increases for foodstuffs amounted to 26 percent, 
and for industrial commodities--21 percent. 
  The cost of a minimum consumer selection of 19 main food 
products in the oblast center in September amounted to R51,406, 
or, for example, more than in the city of Vladivostok by a 
factor of 1.8. 
<H5>  The Social Sphere </H5>
<H5>  The Demographic Situation </H5>
  The demographic situation in the oblast remains difficult. 
This year for the first time the oblast became one of those 
oblasts with natural population loss, when the number of deaths 
exceeds the number of births. Regardless of the drop in the 
rates of migration, the balance of migration (the difference 
between the number of arrivals and departures) remains negative. 
The total population for the beginning of October, according to 
preliminary calculations, was 511,800 persons, falling by 4.5 
percent in nine months. 
<H5>  Labor Resources and Monetary Incomes of the Population </H5>
  The decrease in the number of workers in oblast enterprises 
(without taking commercial structures into account) continued in 
August of this year. 
  In September 1993, 453 unemployed citizens applied to the 
oblast employment center for job placement. On 1 October the 
number in search of work who applied totaled 2,687 persons. 
There were 1,914 persons with unemployed status, of whom 71.2 
percent were receiving benefit. 
  The average wage of workers in enterprises of the oblast 
continues to grow. The level reached R192,800 in August, 
increasing with respect to the previous month by 19 percent. 
  In spite of the recalculation of wages in organizations 
financed at the expense of the local budget, the gap in wages in 
branches of material production and the nonproduction sphere 
continues to be big (R217,600 and R136,400 respectively). 
  Among the regions of the Far East, Magadan Oblast firmly 
occupies first place in the level of wages. However, Kamchatka 
Oblast leads in the rate of growth for the previous month (142.6 
percent against 119.1 for Magadan Oblast). 
  For January-September of this year, the monetary income of 
the population of the oblast, according to preliminary 
estimates, increased in comparison with the corresponding period 
of last year by a factor of 12, and in September to January by a 
factor of 6. 
  However, inflation introduces adjustments to incomes: As a 
result of the limited effective demand on the part of a 
substantial part of the population, the share of consumer 
expenditures fell from 35 percent in January to 28 percent in 
September. 
<H5>  Consumer Market in Goods and Services </H5>
  The production of consumer goods amounted to R36.1 billion, 
which is 11.8 percent higher than last year's level. The 
production of food products is increasing only in cost terms, 
the output of meat decreased in natural terms by 28 percent, 
sausage items--by 17 percent, whole milk products--by 39 
percent, bread and bakery products--by 17 percent, nonalcoholic 
beverages--by 48 percent, and mineral water--by 72 percent. 
  The production of nonfood consumer items in comparison with 
January-September of last year was cut by 35.6 percent and 
amounted to R2,869.1 billion. 
  The increase in goods turnover owing to price increases 
amounted to R62 billion. In physical volume, 23 percent less 
goods were sold to the population than in the corresponding 
period of last year. 
  The extent of implementation of paid services in existing 
prices amounted to R17.8 billion. Of this, state enterprises 
rendered the population of the oblast 98 percent of the volume 
of paid services, and private enterprises--2 percent. In 
comparable prices this volume was reduced compared to the level 
of last year by 66.1 percent, and in per capita terms, by 64.2 
percent. The repeated freeing of prices for energy sources led 
to an increase in the cost of all types of paid services. Prices 
increased especially sharply for passenger and everyday 
services, and also for communications services and public and 
children's preschool institutions. 
<H5>  Material Production </H5>
<H5>  Industry </H5>
  In nine months of 1993, state enterprises, joint-stock 
companies, and associations produced products in current prices 
worth R352.2193 billion, including in September--71.364.7 
billion. In comparison with January-September of 1992 this 
volume increased by a factor of 9.5. 
  It was possible in September to stabilize the work of 
enterprises somewhat, and the output of products increased by 
1.9 percent in comparison with the same month of last year. 
  A reduction of the output of products in natural terms is 
observed in more than 70 percent of the named articles taken 
into account in periodic reporting. Among these are electric 
power, steel, precast reinforced concrete, walling materials, 
industrial wood, lumber, trailers and semi-trailers, drilling 
rigs and others, including consumer goods. 
  Since the beginning of the year, a decline in production has 
continued to be observed in all industrial branches. Nonferrous 
metallurgy enterprises and the food processing and fish 
industries exceeded the September levels of last year. 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  The reforms being conducted in rural areas have not yet been 
able to correct the difficult situation in the agrarian sector 
of the economy. 
  Due to financial difficulties the sovkhozes were unable to 
acquire a sufficient amount of fuel. As a result, by 12 October 
about 10 hectares of potatoes and 11.5 hectares of vegetables 
were not harvested. 
  Preparation of the fields for next year was going on 
simultaneously with harvesting. Land plowed in the autumn for 
spring sowing exceeded last year's level by 960 hectares, and 
winter crops were sown on 48 hectares. 
  The state of affairs with the preparation of fodder causes 
alarm. By the beginning of October, 10,900 tonnes of hay, or 27 
percent of the plan, were received, according to formal 
documents. 
  The state of affairs in livestock breeding is also not 
improving. A substantial drop in the cattle population and a 
lowering in its productivity led to a slump in the production of 
food products. 
  In nine months of this year, the sovkhozes of the oblast 
sold 
7,600 tonnes for slaughter. In comparison with the very same 
period last year, the production of meat fell by 20 percent. 
  The extent of the decrease in milk production amounted to 
8,000 tonnes. 
  Less eggs were produced in all poultry farms, except for the 
Yagodninskiy Rayon. 
<H5>  Capital Construction </H5>
  Because of inflationary processes and difficulties in the 
transition period, the rates of capital construction in the 
oblast continue to decrease. In nine months of this year the 
introduction of fixed assets (in current prices) totaled R6.1 
billion and exceeded the corresponding period of last year 
(owing to an increase in prices) by a factor of 4.4. 
  Owing to all sources of financing in the oblast, 24,700 
square meters of general residential buildings area, or 398 
apartments, were introduced, and compared to data for nine 
months of 1992 the introduction of housing was reduced by 12,000 
square meters (by 33 percent). The acuteness of the housing 
problem in the oblast is partially being removed owing to the 
redemption of housing from the population. Thus, for nine months 
of this year, owing to the resources of republic and local 
budgets, the administrations of the city and the rayons of the 
oblast acquired about 500 apartments, of which 395 apartments 
are in the city of Magadan. 
<H5>  Transport and Communications </H5>
  The problem of freight and passenger transportation remains 
acute. In comparison with last year the transport of freight by 
general use motor vehicles was reduced by more than half (50.3 
percent), and freight turnover decreased simultaneously by 36.2 
percent. This reduction is explained by the incomplete delivery 
of national economic freight to the trading port of the city of 
Magadan. 
  Transportation by general use buses fell by 10 percent, 
amounting to 36.3 million persons. Passenger turnover was 
reduced by almost half (44 percent). 
  Income received from the main activity of communications 
enterprises grew by a factor of more than 12. 
<H5>  Material-Technical Supply </H5>
  Preparation of enterprises for work under winter conditions 
proceeded over the summer period. The reserves of coal in 
Magadan Oblast at the beginning of the cold season totaled 
693,000 tonnes, 4 percent less than last year. 
  The reserves of solid fuel in the enterprises of the 
joint-stock company Magadanenergo exceed last year's by 21 
percent and totaled 385,000 tonnes. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Relations </H5>
  The foreign trade turnover of the oblast for nine months of 
this year reached $36 million. Products in the amount of $15.5 
million were exported to foreign firms, and goods totalling 
$20.5 million were imported. As before, imports exceeded 
exports, as indicated by the negative balance amounting to $5 
million. The increase in export deliveries for the past month is 
insignificant--$1.4 million, and imports remained at the level 
of eight months. In the last quarter, as in the previous one, 
exports increased by $6 million, and revenues from abroad 
dropped significantly. 
  The mass appearance on the foreign market of enterprises of 
new forms of economic management is observed under conditions of 
the formation of market relations--these are joint-stock 
companies and associations, joint enterprises, partnerships with 
limited liability, firms, companies, individual private 
enterprises, cooperatives, and others. They are responsible for 
an overwhelming proportion of exports--75 percent--and one-fifth 
of imports of the oblast. 
  The share of foreign enterprises in the oblast's exports and 
imports is insignificant--less than 1 percent.

"Magadan Oblast Revises Gold Production Data"] 
  [Text] Preliminary results of gold production in Magadan 
Oblast, according to which gold output in 1993 fell by 4 tonnes 
(-8 percent) compared to 1992 (see SEGODNYA No. 85), were not 
confirmed. According to revised but still not final data which 
was released by the Northeastern Geological Committee, last year 
the oblast turned over to the state 28,561 tonnes of gold 
(29,156 tonnes in 1992). During the 11 months the 
Severovostokzoloto produced 22,502 tonnes (25,262 tonnes in all 
of 1992). Gold mining cooperatives and new gold-producing 
structures which do not belong to the Severovostokzoloto 
produced 4,773 tonnes (3,894 tonnes). According to Vladimir 
Banin, deputy head of the Magadan Oblast Administration, there 
are grounds to believe that not all of the metal produced last 
year has been turned over to the state yet.

<F P=106> [Article by Lidiya Timofeyeva under the rubric "Political </F>
Portrait in a Setting": "A `Rebellious' Governor in a Rebellious 
Country"] 
  [Text] Eduard Rossel is a prominent figure. He is the 
former governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast who sought to create the 
Urals Republic, leader of the nonpolitical movement Revival of 
the Urals, and a member of the Federation Council. 
<H5>  Sverdlovsk Would Not Be Swayed by Tears, Either </H5>
  This man could say: "I made myself." He was born in the 
infamous year 1937, having already lost his father. His father 
was wasted one month before the son's arrival on the absurd and 
terrifying charge of "not being one of us." He was not "one of 
us" because he was a joiner, a cabinet-maker, headed a 
variety-show band, and "wore a Polish suit," and finally, just 
because he was a "Volga German." At age four the boy ended up an 
orphan, but with a living mother who was exiled to the north 
without correspondence privileges. He was a vagrant from 1942 to 
1947. The war, the one woe shared by the entire people and the 
entire country, "helped" him to not become a thief or die. His 
mother found him in Verkhnekamsk through the all-Union search 
service. 
  Having been hopelessly late for everything good early in 
life, he made up for this with a persistence and ambition that 
turned out to be characteristic. At the age of 21 he graduated 
high school. He tossed the handbook "Where To Go To Study" at 
random, and it opened to the letter "S." He was not expected 
anywhere, but Sverdlovsk had so many institutes! He opted for 
the mining institute. 
  The gifted student began to write his candidate dissertation 
even before defending his diploma. However, his scientific 
career was not to be for the most mundane reason, although he 
was retained as a junior research associate: There was no money 
to support his wife and daughter. To be sure, he would yet 
defend the dissertation and become a candidate of technical 
sciences. At that time, he went to Nizhniy Tagil where he began 
his climb, not skipping a single step: from foreman to chief of 
the Sreduralstroy territorial construction association. He built 
dozens of unique enterprises within strikingly short periods of 
just one year. When one of these enterprises was being 
commissioned, Boris Yeltsin, the leader of the oblast at the 
time, deeply touched, took off a golden alarm wristwatch which 
had, in turn, been given to Yeltsin as a birthday gift 
by...Leonid Ilich himself, and gave it Rossel. 
  They also began to value Rossel in the Urals as a good 
regional-level leader when he was elected oblast executive 
committee chairman in 1990 and soon also chairman of the oblast 
soviet. This combination of positions was authorized for 
Sverdlovsk Oblast on an experimental basis. In 1991 Rossel was 
appointed head of the administration by a presidential edict. He 
got a difficult place to manage. When Rossel assumed this 
position, grain stocks in the oblast were sufficient for only 10 
days. Later, there was enough for one day. Desperate appeals to 
officials in Moscow accomplished nothing. One night he got on a 
plane and flew to Almaty, to Nazarbayev. Kazakhstan agreed to 
provide grain in exchange for metal, timber, and pipes. However, 
Rossel had to break all the contracts.... A new misfortune soon 
occurred--the banks stopped paying out cash. Gaydar helped 
Rossel as best he could. However, the catastrophe struck the 
entire country, and other ways out had to be sought. They made 
an arrangement with Perm, which had ready cash but no butter or 
mayonnaise.... 
  Even then the shrewd Rossel understood that he could not 
expect favors from on high. On one hand, the resources of the 
country were dwindling; on the other hand, the burden of power 
oppressed the center, and it began to delegate power down a drop 
at a time. In the process the center wasted no opportunity to 
show the "provincials" who was in charge in the house by signing 
or failing to sign "authorization" papers. However, the much 
desired decrees concerning the oblast, which had been arranged 
with a lot of difficulty, had ceased to carry any weight. There 
was no force that could make these papers with the state emblem 
"work." 
<H5>  `We Are Pragmatists, Not Separatists' </H5>
  Rossel says: "Self-dependence is a trait of my character. I 
was assigned a certain volume of work, and from that moment on 
the supervisor ceased to exist for me. I was responsible for the 
work from beginning to end, and I always did it, no matter what 
this cost me." 
  You cannot call him a romantic. He is intelligent, prudent, 
and pragmatic. He is a man with a lot of willpower. His are the 
strong shoulders of a skier, all-rounder, volleyball player.... 
He likes combinations including many moves, such as in chess and 
Russian checkers, in which he has respectable ratings. 
Generally, he is a fighter. Having pondered his position and the 
situation in the country, he resolved to take the next step. 
  In 1991 his team developed a statute of real power in the 
oblast to supplement the Federation Treaty and submitted it to 
the Supreme Soviet. The Supreme Soviet rejected the statute. 
Rossel then secured a meeting with the president and showed him 
a draft edict on an economic experiment. He tried to persuade 
Boris Yeltsin that if the experiment worked out, it would be 
possible to expand it to include other regions without a loss. 
The president approved the idea and called Viktor Chernomyrdin 
right away. He was supportive, too. The old pattern of making 
the rounds of offices and collecting endorsements for the edict 
began. As a result, there were 18 rejections instead of the 18 
necessary endorsements. What was to be done? Rossel gathered a 
narrow circle of like-minded people and argued that the final 
step remained: to create a republic. After all, under the 
Constitution in effect at the time, one had to have status in 
order to obtain rights, and in order to get status, one needed 
to be called a republic because oblasts had virtually no rights. 
"We had one chance in 100. I understood that my venture could 
end in my being relieved. However, we acted solely within the 
law." 
  According to the old Constitution, they first polled the 
population and held a session of the oblast soviet. 
Subsequently, they proclaimed the republic in July 1993 and 
adopted a declaration. A draft Constitution was developed, which 
they used as the basis and published in the press. The people 
responded. Rossel received more than 1,000 remarks which were 
considered by a special constitutional commission. Finally, the 
Constitution of the Urals Republic was ultimately adopted, and 
at the same time a law on elections was approved at a session of 
the oblast soviet according to which an election of the 
legislative assembly and governor of the Urals Republic was to 
be held on 12 December. 
  At this point, Moscow choked with wrath. First, a fax was 
received on 9 November on the oblast soviet being dispersed; an 
envoy urgently flew to Yekaterinburg to keep an eye on the 
actions of "separatists." At equal time intervals, the official 
who arrived reported to the center what was happening, and said 
that Rossel did not intend to disband the oblast soviet but, on 
the contrary, had signed a decree on protection for deputies 
left without a job following the presidential edict. The 
following day, a second fax message came on Rossel being 
relieved for "exceeding state authority." 
  It is an irony of fate that the Sverdlovsk candidate for 
deputy of Russia Boris Yeltsin wrote in his election program in 
1990: "Following a referendum, self-governing socioeconomic 
territories and regions may be formed within the RSFSR. Their 
rights will be set forth in the new Constitution of the RSFSR." 
In turn, Sergey Shakhray, chairman of the Goskomnats 
[abbreviation as published; State Committee on Federation and 
Nationality Affairs], who as recently July had stated that it 
was necessary to relieve Rossel from his position, on 
familiarizing himself with Rossel's proposals became an active 
proponent of the idea of economic federalism, making it the 
banner of his party and the campaign for elections to the State 
Duma. 
  This begs the question: Whom did the officials from Moscow 
hurt more? Indeed, Eduard Ergartovich was relieved from the 
position of governor. However, at a meeting of the council of 
the Association for Economic Cooperation Between Oblasts and 
Republics of the Urals Region immediately following Moscow's 
decision, he was elected president of this association. This 
indicates the opinion of the leaders of five oblasts and two 
republics of Russia. Could the officials have hurt themselves 
the most? After all, having closed down this experiment, they 
will soon be unable to distribute anything themselves; after 
all, production is continuing to fall. However, most importantly 
they have hurt the residents of the Urals who did not intend to 
sail away from Russia in their boat but, on the contrary, 
intended to live together with everyone, but producing goods 
intelligently and strengthening relations that multiply our 
common wealth. 
<H6>  *** </H6>
  Appeals and letters seeking that the edict concerning Rossel 
be canceled are still being sent to the president. I for one 
recalled one episode from his life. He writes "German" in the 
box "nationality" in questionnaires. This was what his parents 
wrote, as well as his forefathers, who ended up in Russia under 
Catherine II. In terms of his way of life, upbringing, and 
religion, he is Orthodox, baptized, and Russian. Recently 
Jacques Attali, former president of the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, tried to open his eyes to the 
mystery of his stock, telling him that Germans do not have such 
a last name, but that this was the last name of the 27-year-old 
Rossel, a military figure of the Paris Commune, who was shot 
after the revolution was defeated. The Rossel dynasty hastily 
left Paris, going to Germany. 
  It is hard to say whether this is a legend or the truth. 
Something else is striking: Each nation is prepared to consider 
a talented man its own--Pushkin with his African blood, and 
Lermontov with his admixture of Scottish clans. So, the French 
want to "appropriate" our Rossel, too. It is ridiculous.... We 
need him ourselves.

<F P=106> [Article by Richard Ovinnikov, Doctor of Historical </F>
Sciences: "Hurting for the State: Patriotism or Imperial 
Ambitions?"] 
  [Text] As the results of the elections to the Federal 
Assembly showed, appearing in the part of the second most 
important factor influencing Russians' consciousness--after the 
crisis state of the country's economy--was the foreign policy 
question. Namely, concerning Russia's present impaired 
international position. 
  The large-scale dismantling of the Russian Federation's 
international positions is connected primarily with the collapse 
of the Soviet Union. Even as the continuer-state, which has 
preserved three-fourths of the territory of the former USSR, but 
which has lost 40 percent of its economic potential and half its 
population, Russia is not now in a position to lay claim to this 
role. In addition, it has found itself without allies and with a 
mass of problems on borders dotted like shagreen leather. The 
realities are harsh: As a century ago, Russia has been pushed 
northeastward and pressed back to the Polar Circle. 
  The question of the ways of ensuring the country's security 
under such unfamiliar conditions simply could not have failed to 
have come front stage in domestic policy. But it has been lent 
particular seriousness by a number of far from obligatory 
derivatives of the process of the "'shrinkage' of Russia's 
influence." 
  Thus, it was difficult from the very outset to explain the 
absence of attempts to preserve the tried-and-tested relations 
with the former Union republics. It was disheartening that 
countries designated new allies permitted themselves to treat us 
as the poor relation. They insistently put out flags indicating 
the limit of Russia's influence. The absence of its real defense 
of the rights of 25 million brothers who speak the same language 
and who have come, through no fault of their own, to be outside 
its boundaries was disturbing also. 
  The spontaneous explosion of civil feeling, which had been 
hurt to the quick, was a natural human reaction to the 
infringement of national dignity. It may be called patriotism, 
as do some, or nationalism, as do others, but the main thing 
here was the idea of the preservation and affirmation of Russia 
as an independent factor in the world system of states--shaped 
over centuries, distinctive, and with its own rights and 
interests. 
  It is time for everyone, evidently, the radical democrats 
included, to recognize the ponderability of these, it may now 
confidently be said, national aspirations. Healthy patriotism is 
a natural feeling of any normal citizen who does not have an 
urge to unfailingly remake Russia as something else or chop off 
its historical roots. 
  A most important constituent of the international climate 
with reference to the Russian Federation on the threshold of the 
21st century are primarily its close surroundings. These are now 
the countries of the CIS and also traditional neighbors, 
primarily in East Europe. Another such most important reality of 
the external situation is the circle of industrially developed 
countries of the West, primarily the Seven. Its geographical 
remoteness does not diminish its influence, particularly when it 
acts jointly. All the other force vectors of international life 
are for Russia ultimately merely of a secondary, background 
nature. 
  For this reason, the country's cardinal task for the years 
ahead should be the encouragement of the lapping and mating of 
two most important factors--the close surroundings and the West. 
In other words, assurance that they operate in a mode of general 
stabilization and consolidation, not follow different courses. 
Were Russia to be confronted with an "either-or" choice, and 
were it to agree to this, such a development would be for it 
tantamount to a major strategic loss. 
  Russia, if it wishes to remain itself, cannot renounce its 
geopolitical and civilizational essence as a power pulling 
together the two most populous continents. This uniquely 
propitious Eurasian format, which was its cradle and which gave 
birth to its greatness, is critically important for it in the 
future also, as the link with mother earth for Antaeus. On the 
other hand, the end to the confrontation with the West, which 
has for the first time in many decades freed up colossal 
development potential and which presupposes broad mutually 
advantageous cooperation, could be promising as another, new 
constant of Russian policy. 
  Unfortunately, the possibility of firmly establishing such a 
stable movement in the future with a foothold in both factors is 
not for the Russian Federation today easy. Through, most likely, 
no fault of its own. 
  Does the West need a united and strong Russia? Eschewing a 
starry-eyed "yes," there is as yet no simple answer to this 
question. There is a dual attitude toward it, regardless of any 
ideology which it has, what is more. This was best expressed by 
Henry Kissinger. "On the one hand," he wrote in the 
INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE after the disintegration of the 
USSR, "the tsarist and Soviet empires grew into a constant 
threat to the balance of forces along their entire vast 
perimeter in Europe, the Far East, and Asia. On the other, these 
empires twice saved the independence of the European countries, 
inasmuch as without their contribution Napoleon and Hitler would 
have gained the upper hand." 
  Thanks for the kind words, as they say, but why, then, the 
other theme--"constant threat." Is this not double-dealing? Why 
should Russia alone be approached with such prejudiced 
yardsticks? The British Empire, which was earlier called such 
officially, has now been transformed into a commonwealth headed 
by Britain, which is endeavoring to maintain special relations 
among its members. But no one is rushing to take a stab at the 
imperial ambitions of the British. France similarly grouped its 
former colonies in a community of Francophone countries, and no 
one reproaches it for this. Finally, the United States, which 
back in 1823 declared the Western Hemisphere to be the sphere of 
its special interests (the Monroe Doctrine), adheres today to 
the same policy, although, let us be plain, far from everyone 
agrees with this. 
  Yet in all three cases it is a question of great powers 
considering it useful to unite around them countries located 
here thousands and even tens of thousands of kilometers away, as 
a rule. It would seem that people would like to deny Russia, on 
the other hand, the right to have immediate surroundings that 
are favorable to it--a viable Commonwealth of Independent 
States. But this is a double standard. Whoever wishes to be our 
dependable partner must recognize that the Russian Federation 
seeks not exceptional but equal and commensurate conditions of 
development. Russians would not understand anything else. 
  In order to avoid unacceptable discrimination, it is 
essential that Russia cleave properly but firmly to a course 
whose essence is that it is not an inferior object, but a 
ponderable subject of international policy. This means that it 
also may--by political methods and a basis that is voluntary for 
the other participants--form external surroundings, close 
surroundings even more, which are friendly toward it and which 
are developing constructively. As, for example, is being done by 
the United States, which has formed together with Mexico and 
Canada the common North American free trade zone. 
  Of course, Russia's actions in this plane must be 
comprehensible to its partners near and far and instill trust in 
them. But Russia also is entitled to expect the understanding 
and trust of others. It is in the achievement of such a 
two-in-one goal that the art of the foreign policy and diplomacy 
of a truly great power lies. Here also lies the difference 
between patriotism and imperial ambitions.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Fadin, under the "Subject of the Week" </F>
rubric: "Who Removed Gaydar"] 
  [Text] Everything in our life is related, at times in a way 
that is not readily apparent. Zhirinovskiy's elevation, 
Clinton's visit, Gaydar's resignation, Kozyrev's by now rather 
imperialistic statements, and the collapse of the ruble rate of 
exchange give an example of exactly such a 
relationship--everything is interrelated. 
  We will try to track some amusing relationships in this 
configuration. 
  The elevation of the Zhirinovskiy supporters frightened more 
than just our neighbors in the post-USSR; the leaders of the 
West also revealed serious fears for the future of the "new 
world order" that began to be visible--some sincerely, and some 
as an argument in favor of maintaining a military potential. 
  However, whatever the real motives of the leaders of the 
West 
were, no one today needs an openly imperial and consistently 
anti-Western Russia. It is precisely for this reason that the 
West saw a serious threat in the prospect of a Zhirinovskiy 
victory (for example, in the presidential elections) not to the 
somewhat abstract "Russian democracy," but to its own rather 
concrete interests. The reaction to the outcome of the elections 
was rather unambiguous. Yeltsin now represented the last 
guarantor against the victory of Nazism and, consequently, an 
unconditional ally. 
  The unconditionality in this case is a literal concept, and 
it means that the West actually removed all of its main 
conditions of support for Yeltsin--demilitarization (reduction 
of the Army, conversion), civilized behavior in the "near 
abroad," and, finally, consistent and rapid market reforms. At 
first, Grachev's pre-New Year statement about the actual halt in 
the reduction of the Army, and afterwards Kozyrev's statement 
about the need for Russia's military presence in the post-Soviet 
republics (that is, in the independent states!) did not evoke 
practically any kind of adequate tough "return" of the West. 
Afterwards, from the lips of American Vice President Al Gore 
came the slogan "More therapy--less shock," which seemed to come 
from a preelection Volskiy poster. 
  It had already become clear at that moment that the official 
West would no longer insist on the continuation of the Gaydar 
line and the retention of Gaydar himself in the government as a 
guarantor of the progress of Russia toward a market. Facing the 
threat of a "Weimar scenario," about whose actuality for Russia 
Aleksandr Yanov had written for a long time, the West abandoned 
unequivocal support of a liberal market and a liberal democracy. 
  It is clear that the coming changes in the government (and 
this means a change in policy also) could not help but be 
discussed at the Yeltsin and Clinton meeting. It is also clear 
that Clinton did not set Gaydar's retention in the government as 
a condition for his support of Yeltsin. As a result, the 
so-promising analogy in the destinies of Yegor Gaydar and Leszek 
Balcerowicz was stopped. 
  (At one time, the West made it clear to the "Polish Yeltsin, 
" Lech Walenca, that the retention of Balcerowicz, the "Polish 
Gaydar," after the next change in the government, was a 
condition for numerous credit-financial benefits to Poland. And 
Balcerowicz remained--up to the completion of his task of "dirty 
work," the most tormenting for society, but absolutely necessary 
to Polish reforms. Balcerowicz left, just as spent steam leaves 
after it has fulfilled its work in a machine....) 
  Gaydar was sent off, it seems, before the country arrived 
"at 
the point of no return," without giving him a chance to execute 
a critical volume of "dirty work." The limitation of the 
analogies revealed itself at this turning point: Yeltsin proved 
not to be Walenca, and Gaydar proved not to be Balcerowicz, but 
the main thing is that Russia did not turn out to be a Poland. 
And only the West proved to be itself: no permanent friends, 
only permanent interests. 
  The profound national-fundamentalist shift in the national 
conscience, which Mr. Zhirinovskiy capitalized on so much, 
confronted the West with a dilemma: Continue to bring pressure 
on the present Russian leadership in the direction of its 
further Westernization (with the risk of a powerful reaction of 
Russia's grass roots), or allow Russia to stew in its own 
authoritarian-statist juice, maintaining for itself only one 
position--but important to itself: a pro-Western orientation. 
Clinton's visit showed that the West chose the second variant. 
What is more, judging by the absence of a reaction to the 
statements of Kozyrev and Grachev, the West actually issued a 
license to the Yeltsin leadership to implement the functions of 
a regional overseer in the post-Soviet space. 
  A similar reorientation of the West matured long ago, but 
Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy's Duma breakthrough gave its formulation a shove. 
Now--and the West, it seems, has accepted this--the Yeltsin 
leadership will be compelled "to run ahead of Zhirinovskiy," in 
part fulfilling his program in order to intercept his audience. 
History is repeating itself. After winning a victory over the 
national-patriots in October, the "collective Yeltsin" is 
beginning to fulfill their program. 
  In this program, Gaydar, deprived of the support of the 
West, 
is superfluous. 
  Thus, Zhirinovskiy, personifying the reaction of the grass 
roots to forced modernization, removed Gaydar through the very 
act of his own electoral victory.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Portnikov: "Andrey Kozyrev Defines </F>
Priorities; Meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the 
Russian Federation With Ambassadors to CIS and Baltic Countries"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Opinion </H5>
  The speech of the minister of foreign affairs of Russia at a 
conference of the leaders of diplomatic missions in Commonwealth 
and Baltic countries hardly struck observers with its novelty 
and sensationalism. A majority of the theses expounded by Andrey 
Kozyrev have already been heard--during both the recent visit of 
the minister in the countries of Central Asia, which complicated 
the mutual understanding of the Kremlin and Almaty even more, 
and during the preelection speech of one of the leaders of 
Russia's Choice bloc in Murmansk. However, at that time, such 
rhetoric was explained by the impending elections, and the 
necessity to seize the "patriotic initiative" from such 
politicians as Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. And although the results 
of the elections convincingly demonstrated that on the field of 
"patriotic initiative," there is no way at all for democratic 
politicians to beat Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Sergey Baburin, 
the minister of foreign affairs of Russia considered it 
necessary again to repeat his preelection program. Obviously, it 
is now becoming the concept of Russian foreign policy, and the 
ambassadors of Russia in CIS and Baltic countries will have to 
accept the directives of the minister for implementation. 
  The main priority of Russian foreign policy remains as 
before 
the protection of the Russian-speaking population in the 
countries of the "near abroad." This is a well-considered 
policy, arrived at by the minister with much agonizing. A large 
if not an absolute part of the citizens of Russia living in the 
former Union republics already gave their votes to Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy in the elections. The energetic protection of the 
rights of noncitizens, in the final analysis, could lead to the 
introduction of the institution of dual citizenship in a number 
of republics, the emergence of new Russian citizens, and an 
increase in the voting electorate in Russia by more than a 
third. The minister probably expects that the position of the 
MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] will lead to the popularity of 
the bloc that is being supported by Andrey Kozyrev among these 
potential voters. The game on the field of "patriotic 
initiative" is continuing. The winner is already known. 
  The whole Commonwealth has been declared a zone of vital 
interests of Russia and, as a consequence of this, a zone of 
potential threat for it. However, in contrast to the 
representatives of the military department, which sometimes 
comes out with poorly reasoned initiatives of a force nature, 
the leader of the Russian diplomats advised supporting a 
balance, having called extremists both those who want to 
introduce new tanks into the republics and those who want to 
withdraw the old ones. Andrey Kozyrev associated this concept of 
his with the possibility of military cooperation between Russia 
and the CIS and Baltic countries (!), which, probably, will 
especially touch the Baltic politicians, who have not yet 
forgotten the recent assurances of Boris Yeltsin at a press 
conference with Bill Clinton on the need to withdraw Russian 
troops from the Baltic countries. But as Grigoriy Yavlinskiy 
observed, true, in another connection, "Clinton has departed--we 
can change the decor." A large portrait of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
in a gilded frame could occupy its own place in the new decor of 
Russian foreign policy. If it were not for this remarkable 
person, how difficult it would be for many Russian politicians 
to preserve the reputation of a "dove." But everyone is against 
a background of a moving portrait of a "dove," gushing power 
energy. Including Andranik Migranyan, the political scientist 
from the president's circle, who appeared in the pages of 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA with a variety number on the subject of the 
Monroe Doctrine for the former Union. And Galina Sidorova, 
political adviser to the Russian minister of foreign affairs, 
who responded to the medieval ideas of Migranyan in the spirit 
of new political thinking of 1980's, with a selection of 
quotations from Andrey Kozyrev. Concerning the CIS as "the only 
possible form of a revived Union," and concerning "the tough, 
including forceful, methods of defending Russian policy." Andrey 
Kozyrev, under the Damocles' sword of resignation, appeared with 
these ideas at the Russian deputy congress, and they were 
perceived as a compromise with the "irreconcilable"--if only to 
retain the liberal minister! But now they were useful for 
something else--to justify the perennial dominion of the Russian 
MFA.... 
  Andrey Kozyrev himself looks like a dove--and he will 
continue to look like one no matter what. But let us recall his 
famous "hilarious" speech in Strasbourg and compare it with 
current speeches in order to be convinced: Andrey Kozyrev at 
that time was not expounding a program of irreconcilable 
opposition, but a variant of his future program. And if the 
Zhirinovskiy factor made it possible for Russian diplomacy to 
easily change the cherished policy of equality of rights in 
relations with the former Soviet republics, then changes with 
the very same flavoring can also be predicted on other flanks: 
Not to let Vladimir Volfovich get into a position of power. This 
is the way Zhirinovskiy's regime is being formed without 
Zhirinovskiy. Or: If Vladimir Volfovich comes to power, he will 
not have to change a thing. 
  Including the minister of foreign affairs as well.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy director of </F>
Institute of the United States and Canada of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences: "Something Out of Nothing? On the Results of the 
Moscow Meeting of the American and Russian Presidents"] 
  [Text] High-level meetings rarely take place without 
results. The immense diplomatic mechanism works on preparing for 
them and it must prepare at least something for the leaders of 
the countries to sign. Thus the latest Russian-American summit 
meeting ended with the signing of 12 agreements, which the 
propaganda organs of the two countries announced with a great 
deal of ceremony. 
  To say that the meeting was meaningless would be a great 
exaggeration. Among its results was the signing of the 
Russian-Ukrainian-American agreement on the elimination of 
nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory. For quite understandable 
reasons, this agreement is of extremely special significance, 
although the fact that it was signed by three and not two 
participants (just Russia and Ukraine) is an immense minus for 
Russian diplomacy. The agreement could quite easily have been 
reached without the United States, the more so since, as it 
turns out, Russia will still have to pay for it--by delivering 
energy sources to Ukraine free of charge. And the United States, 
as usual, added to its assets an unconditional success while 
getting off with vague promises. 
  As for other results of the meeting between Yeltsin and 
Clinton, one can hardly classify them as paramount. The United 
States made the greatest concessions to Russia in questions of 
trade and the confirmation of human rights as a permanent value. 
  As we know, the Russian economy is certainly not now in a 
condition where the warehouses are crammed with finished 
products and the store shelves are groaning under the excess of 
domestic goods. If that were the case, one could understand and 
appreciate the official optimism: Really, Russian goods are 
finally breaking through, like the Japanese, to the American 
market. But that, alas, will not happen. And the fact that the 
economic agreement that was reached will help with the sale of 
Russian uranium and aluminum in the United States by no means 
evokes rapture. We know from experience that a breakthrough of 
particular raw material goods or semimanufactured products from 
Russia into the world market leads to making a group of 
wheeler-dealers with questionable reputations and a certain 
circle of high-level bureaucrats rich. Such "achievements" do 
nothing for the development of the economy. 
  Official commentators link the joint Russian-American human 
rights declaration to potential possibilities of protecting the 
human rights of the Russian and Russian-speaking population in 
the former Soviet republics, especially the Baltics. Perhaps 
this is indeed the case. But it is fair to ask: Can it be that 
the governments and parliaments of the countries where Russians 
are subjected to persecution and discrimination have never heard 
of human rights before? Did they not sign the documents of the 
Council on Security and Cooperation in Europe regarding this? 
  The American President flew into Moscow with the news that 
NATO, after studying the new alignment of forces in Europe, was 
radically changing its strategy. At one point, at the dawn of 
perestroyka and the "new thinking," there were statements in the 
spirit of the need to disband military blocs and create some 
kind of single system of collective security in Europe and 
throughout all of the Northern Hemisphere--"from Vladivostok to 
Vancouver." Then after the Warsaw Pact was disbanded these good 
intentions were replaced by discussions of the "NATO's new role" 
outside Europe: in the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean Sea, 
Africa. And now this new role has finally become clearcut: 
"Drang nach Osten," to the East. 
  In order not to frighten the tender liberals and not to 
confuse those in Russia who have long been asking to be taken 
under NATO's wing, the new doctrine speaks incomprehensibly 
about a "partnership for peace." It is in keeping with the 
spirit of the times and it does not threaten anyone. But if you 
remove the pretty verbal packaging, the bare military essence 
remains: The NATO bloc is moving toward Russia's borders. 
Elementary common sense tells us that if the "partnership for 
peace" really did not have anti-Russian content we might have 
expected a different scenario: First the NATO bloc would have 
looked for ways of establishing a partnership with Russia, for 
with all of its weakness it is still the largest military power, 
and only after that would the vacuum in Central and Eastern 
Europe have been filled. 
  When he arrived in Russia the American President probably 
had 
his doubts about the kind of reception he and his idea of a 
"partnership" would receive. How obviously glad he was to see 
that this idea did not elicit a great deal of resistance from 
the Russian leadership. 
  Let us recall something else: NATO's position in the former 
Yugoslavia and particularly its soft attitude toward Croatia, 
its readiness to open up military warehouses to the Muslims in 
Bosnia, and the threats of strikes on Serbian positions. The 
Russian president had enough common sense to remind Clinton that 
Yugoslavia is being handled by the UN and nobody invited NATO 
with its role of "peacemaker." The more so with threats in the 
spirit of the Cold War. Regarding this question one must think 
that Russia is finally capable of taking a firm stand. 
  It is difficult to sum up the overall balance sheet of the 
meeting that was held. Here one inevitably has to take into 
account that the U.S. position has become one of the cards in 
the Russian domestic political game of solitaire, and when 
agreeing to this meeting with Clinton the president of Russia 
somehow wanted to take advantage of his arrival to demonstrate 
the strength of his foreign connections and powerful support 
from the West. This he managed to do: Clinton did not favor 
other political figures of Russia with his attention, nor did he 
even speak before parliament. 
  At the same time, the impossibility of having the positions 
of Russia and the United States coincide completely, which was 
revealed during the course of this meeting, will lead to other 
reflections. The period of Russia's "getting used to" its 
neighbors on the continent and the planet is ending. There are 
difficult times ahead when protection of national interests will 
require changes both in the overall style of the "diplomacy of 
smiles" and the content of the Russian foreign policy. It is 
good that this coincides with the beginning of the work of the 
new parliament, which should make a significant contribution to 
the creation of such a policy.

<F P=106> [Article by KOMMERSANT observer Georgiy Bovt and </F>
correspondent Svetlana Sukhova: "Economic Relations Between 
Russia and the United States. For Now the Future Looks Better 
Than the Present"] 
  [Text] Trade and economic cooperation with the United 
States is the most politicized sphere of Russia's foreign 
economic relations. The roots of this go back to the times of 
the Cold War. In recent years quite a few attempts have been 
made to rid ourselves of this heritage, and Bill Clinton's visit 
to Moscow on Saturday may be considered one of the most 
productive steps along this path. There is reason to hope that 
the stereotype of relations between Russia and the United States 
that has developed since the collapse of the USSR and is 
characterized by various forms of economic assistance (for more 
about this see KOMMERSANT for 14 January) from the United States 
while Russia retains discrimination in trade, shall be replaced 
by macroeconomic cooperation with equal rights. The term 
"unstable balance" is quite appropriate for a more precise 
definition of its current condition: This cooperation could 
become significantly more active in the near future or it could 
lapse into a condition of stagnation or even decline. The 
situation before and after Clinton's visit to Moscow is analyzed 
by KOMMERSANT observer Georgiy Bovt and correspondent Svetlana 
Sukhova. 
<H5>  Trade Has Not Yet Been Liberated From the Legacy of the Past </H5>
  The condition of trade and economic cooperation between 
Russia and the United States today leaves something to be 
desired: America's share of Russia's foreign trade is only 2 
percent. Commodity turnover at the end of 1993 reached $2.42 
billion (Russian exports--$1.007 billion, imports--$1.418 
billion). The basis of Russian exports is made up of raw 
materials and certain agricultural products (grain, nonferrous 
and precious metals, oil, and certain chemical commodities). 
Imports are dominated by food and equipment. The figures for 
1993 are not the worst of the indicators for recent years. The 
deficit of the USSR and then Russia is an old affliction of 
trade with the United States: In 1992 Russian imports exceeded 
exports as much as 4.2-fold. 
  True, positive tendencies have also appeared recently. This 
pertains to the gradual elimination of discriminatory 
restrictions in trade with Russia. For the first time since 1951 
Moscow was offered most favored nation status (MFN), and bans 
and limits on credit through the Commodity-Credit Corporation 
and Ex-Im Bank were removed, as were restrictions on services of 
the federal Overseas Private Investment Corporation--OPIC. It is 
permitted to use preferential credit under the program "Food for 
Progress" and the Law "On Contributing to Reform in New 
Democratic Countries" has been adopted (70 restrictions 
established for "communist countries" have been removed). With 
input from the United States the reform of Cocom [Coordinating 
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls] began--albeit late. 
This makes it possible for Russia to hope to gain access to 
science-intensive technologies. During the summer Clinton 
promised (and Moscow again repeated this promise) to extend to 
Moscow the Generalized System of Preferences, which will make it 
possible to abolish customs duties on 5,000 kinds of goods. 
Russia is also promised certain advantages by the creation of 
the North American Free Trade Zone (NAFTA) and the promise from 
the United States (documented in Moscow) to contribute to its 
entry into GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]. 
  Restrictions on American agricultural exports have been 
removed more dynamically. Since 1991 grain has been delivered to 
Russia under special credit programs which, as distinct from the 
five-year agreement between the USSR and the United States of 
1990 (strict minimal volumes of annual purchases were stipulated 
there), leaves a great deal of freedom for the importer to 
maneuver. True, last year Russia ran up a heavy debt for 
agricultural credit (at one time the debt exceeded $500 
million). Active discussions in Moscow about the need to curtail 
agricultural imports in general moved the United States to make 
a number of compromises and in June 1993 conclude four new 
agreements for the delivery of agricultural products to Russia 
within the framework of the "Food for Progress" program. 
Deliveries began in September 1993. 
  At the same time many discriminatory restrictions are still 
in force. The infamous Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which links the 
granting of most favored nation status to free immigration, has 
not been abolished. Although the President has suspended it 
since 1992 (and since 1990--with respect to agricultural trade), 
Congress can restore it fully at any time. And there are also 
many other obstacles to trade. The United States has one of the 
strictest systems of antidumping legislation in the world. In 
1993 a quota was introduced on imports of ferrosilicon from 
Russia and there is the threat that similar measures may be 
introduced for aluminum, steel, and potassium chloride. True, 
the negotiations at the Moscow summit give certain justification 
for assuming that the U.S. administration will not be in any 
hurry with such measures. And among their experts, voices are 
being heard ever more loudly (while, true, they have not 
prevailed) saying that antidumping provisions concerning "unfair 
competition" should not be applied to Russia at all during the 
transition period. There is a precedent already: A decision was 
adopted in Moscow to give Russia guaranteed access to the 
American uranium market for 20 years (the planned profit from 
this transaction is $12 billion). And even earlier, in December, 
as a result of the work of the Chernomyrdin-Gore Commission many 
disputed issues related to interaction between the two countries 
on the space services market were resolved. 
<H5>  Investment Cooperation </H5>
  Still the future of economic cooperation between Russia and 
the United States lies not in the sphere of basic buying and 
selling and, of course, not in the expansion of assistance to 
Russia from the United States. It is no accident that during the 
course of the summit in Moscow a leitmotif of the speeches of 
Russian representatives was the idea of the need not only for 
Russia's access to the U.S. market, but also for an increase in 
private American investments in Russia. Their actual level today 
cannot be called satisfactory. According to figures of the 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of Russia, U.S. 
businessmen have invested only $400 million in the Russian 
economy. And in the Hungarian economy--$2.5 billion. The 
Americans explain their passivity by the "high risk related to 
the political instability." Although firms from the United 
States are even the leaders among Western investors in the 
creation of joint ventures in Russia--there are already 1,400 of 
them. 
  But capital investments in Russia cannot even be called 
completely private because they are backed by the federal 
government in the form, for example, of the OPIC or the Ex-Im 
Bank. When granting guarantees (like the federal OPIC) or credit 
(like, again, the state Ex-Im Bank--$2 billion for the 
development of the petroleum and gas complex) they protect the 
private investor from that very "political risk in Russia." And 
therefore--with such a marked role of the 
administration--economic cooperation is still far from being 
completely depoliticized. Obviously it will still depend for a 
long time on decisions made within bilateral governmental 
commissions--such, for example, as the Gore-Chernomyrdin 
Commission. A great deal will also depend on representative 
associations of businessmen of a lobbyist bent--like the 
American Chamber of Commerce that was opened in Moscow during 
the summit (it unites 150 U.S. firms operating in Russia). 
  The potential for investment cooperation looks quite 
optimistic. According to information from the data bank of the 
EAST EUROPEAN INVESTMENT MAGAZINE, the overall volume of 
declared American private investments during the past four years 
exceeded $4 billion (of the $8.9 billion for the 10 leading 
Western countries). This sum was distributed among 207 bilateral 
projects. The most widespread form of introduction of U.S. 
businessmen to the Russian market is the creation of joint 
ventures (70 percent of all the projects and 90 percent of the 
volume of declared investments). True, it is alarming that the 
growth rate of the number of declared projects was highest in 
1992 and then dropped off. Obviously, in the near future it will 
become clear how successful they are at dispelling the 
misgivings caused by the political instability in Russia. 
  In 1993 several U.S. firms included on the FORTUNE 500 List 
simultaneously announced their intentions to make investments: 
Cummins created a joint venture with KAMAZ for producing 
engines; Exxon, Amoco, and Conoco began to penetrate the Russian 
petroleum and gas complex. It inspires hope that in 1993 they 
announced the largest number of projects in the areas of 
computers and telecommunications in recent years (the removal of 
the Cocom restrictions makes conditions even more favorable for 
new ones). Investors' interest in the Russian aerospace complex 
also increased last year (nine projects were earmarked). 
  But the petroleum and gas complex continues to be as juicy a 
morsel as it was before. According to estimates of the Ministry 
of Foreign Economic Relations, Russia's minimum need for credits 
for its modernization is now no less than $18 billion, and the 
maximum (spread over 10 years)--up to $300 billion. After the 
abolition of the Byrd-Stevenson Amendment in 1992, which set a 
ceiling of $300 million on the overall volume of credits to 
Russia from the Ex-Im Bank (with 40 million--for energy 
projects), the Ex-Im Bank along with the World Bank has already 
allotted more than $2 billion for the development of the 
petroleum and gas branch. 
  The realization of the potential for economic cooperation 
will depend, of course, on the success of the reforms in Russia. 
The question of creating favorable tax and other conditions for 
foreign companies is still crucial. So far guarantees from the 
Russian government to Americans are being replaced by guarantees 
of the OPIC, which intends to help in the creation of an 
independent Russian organization for insurance against political 
risk. 
  The United States has not freed itself (and is not likely to 
free itself) from the "missionary component" in its foreign 
economic policy. Questions of human rights and also political 
interaction with Russia on such global problems as the 
conditions for nonproliferation of missile and dual-use 
technologies, actions with respect to "terrorist regimes," etc. 
will inevitably influence economic relations with Moscow. At 
least until the purely economic interests and investments of the 
United States in Russia reach a level that would enable them to 
rise above the political conditions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Union of Industrialists and </F>
Enterpreneurs (RUIE) President Arkadiy Volskiy by V. Andreyev: 
"We Have Something To Offer Partners"] 
  [Text] 
  [Andreyev] Recently in Moscow the first session of the 
organizing committee for the "Technology From Russia" exhibit 
took place, which will be held in mid-May in the U.S. 
capital--Washington. Can you tell us about the results [of the 
session]? 
  [Volskiy] Last year the Russian Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs [RUIE] jointly with its American partners decided 
to hold an exhibit at which it would be possible to show the 
leading achievements of Russian science and engineering. 
  The idea of holding this exhibit was supported both by the 
Russian government (in December the Council of Ministers issued 
a directive and the organizing committee was created with the 
participation of heads of the country's leading ministries and 
departments) and by the American government. 
  We are talking about an exhibit which would be able to make 
a 
breakthrough into the now unified North American market, where 
namely technology is needed. 
  [Andreyev] Who will participate from the Russian side? 
  [Volskiy] Invitations to participate have been sent to more 
than one thousand enterprises, scientific-research, and 
scientific-production centers. As of today we have several 
hundred responses, primarily from large enterprises which 
understand the importance of a civilized and purposeful entrance 
into the outside market. Moreover, at the same time as our 
exhibit an American industrial exhibit "MAK-94" will be held, 
and ,thus, there is the possibility of direct contact between 
the interested parties. On our side we are proposing to show 
the latest achievements in the spheres of aerospace industry, 
shipbuilding, medical equipment, communications and computer 
science, the mining industry, etc. In addition, there will be a 
series of seminars with prticipation of representatives of the 
largest American firms. 
  [Andreyev] The exhibit will be held on a commercial basis, 
and, apparently, many of our country's enterprises, which are in 
the throes of financial crisis, do not have the money to 
participate. 
  [Volskiy] Yes, the cost of the complete package is about 
$10,000 (with payment in rubles according to the current 
exchange rate). This is an impressive sum, but it includes 
exhibit space, round trip flight, lodging and complete room and 
board from 5-16 May, participation in all measures of the 
exhibit, and talks with American partners. Taking into account 
how foolishly many of our enterprises spend their money on 
advertising their products, such a purposeful investment 
absolutely justifies itself. And for a number of enterprises, 
which produce unique technology but are in a difficult financial 
situation, we will search for sponsors. The organizational 
committee decided this. 
  [Andreyev] When is the deadline for applications? 
  [Volskiy] According to an agreement with the American side, 
which is showing enormous interest in the exhibit, the date for 
submitting applications will last until 15 February. Those 
enterprises and organizations which are ready to exhibit their 
products can write to the exhibit at the address: 109240, 
Moscow, Kotelnicheskaya Embankment 17, apartment 312. 
Telephone: 915 4831. Fax: 926 2052.

<F P=106> [Article by Alexander Umansky: "Exports Grow, Imports Fall"; </F>
first paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment] 
  [Text] Exports of fuels increase, imports of machines and 
equipment fall. 
  The distinguishing feature of Russia's foreign trade in 1993 
has been the rise in exports (despite the economic recession) 
accompanied by a drastic reduction of imports. 
  Russia's foreign trade turnover from January-October 1993 
accounted for a total of 46.9 billion dollars (exports--31.4, 
imports--15.5 billion dollars). The industrially developed 
countries accounted for 40% of exports (18.8 billion 
dollars), 
developing countries--for 9.4% (4.4 billion dollars), and 
the 
share of ex-CMEA countries--17.5% (8.2 billion dollars). 
However the favourable quantitative result provides no grounds 
for positive assessments of foreign trade or its influence on 
the country's economy.

  The fuel and raw materials component of exports, above all, 
owing to a noticeable expansion of exports of non-renewable 
resources, continues to grow. Oil exports in 10 months grew by 
28%, oil products--40%, and timber--39%. 
Exports of pig iron 
grew by 20%, aluminium--35%, and 
ammonia--29%. 
  To preserve the present export growth rates in terms of 
value, it is necessary to increase its volume in natural terms 
at higher rates, since the average export prices are 
substantially reduced. But considering the grave situation in 
Russia's fuel and energy sector, serious difficulties in 
ensuring its domestic requirements, the conclusion can be drawn 
on the increasing instability of the country's export base. 
  To keep imports at a low level means to entail a 
considerable 
reduction of purchases, above all, of food. The marked 
curtailment of the purchases of machines and equipment (by 
5.2%) leads to a lessening influence on the development of 
domestic production and becomes ineffective for the country. 
Besides, foreign economic activity is characterized by the 
intensive development of barter, which spells serious losses of 
hard currency for the country. 
  Yet another negative tendency is the rupture of ties with 
many partners which held a leading place in Russia's foreign 
trade, above all, with former CMEA member-countries. And the 
drive to increase at all costs the volume of exports to foreign 
countries negatively affects supplies to the ex-Soviet 
republics--Russia is losing very important markets. 
  The factors that have shaped in Russia's foreign trade in 
1993 will, most probably, aggravate the situation still more in 
the future. It can be predicted with confidence that foreign 
trade turnover will fall. It is quite possible that already in 
the first quarter of 1994, because of the need to increase the 
supplies of fuel and energy resources for domestic needs, 
exports will fall.

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Kazakov: "Enterprises in China and Russia </F>
Prefer to Trade Directly"; first paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment] 
  [Text] In 1992 trade turnover between the two countries 
reached a record high of 5,862 million dollars, exceeding by 
50.2 percent the corresponding indicator of 1991, and by 
one-third the maximum volume of Soviet-Chinese trade in 1990. 
  A vigorous dash was made by Russian exporters who increased 
by 69.4 percent the sale to the PRC of different goods; 53.8 
percent of which consisted of raw materials and semifinished 
items and 46.2 percent--machines and equipment. During a year 
Russian import from China increased by 28.1 percent, the share 
of industrial consumer goods comprising 55.5 percent. Russia's 
favourable balance of trade stood at 1.2 billion dollars. 
  In the framework of direct trade contacts about 60 percent 
of 
the deals are in the nature of barter operations of the "Russian 
raw materials, plant and equipment for Chinese foodstuffs and 
consumer goods" type. Quite often the latter are dear in price 
and low in quality whereas in the stucture of Russia's 
"barterized" export there has been an increase in the share of 
"hard currency" goods which are sold on prices below world 
prices. This has produced a certain price inequivalence in 
favour of the Chinese partners. 
  The Russian side is represented by a large variety of 
enterprises and firms (about 1,300 juridical persons) whereas 
the Chinese side (to the extent of 80 percent) by a mere three 
large-scale enterprises--the Heilongjiang Foreign Trade Company 
and the border trade companies of the "open" cities of Heihe and 
Suifunhe. In fact border trade boils down to the barter exchange 
of rolled metal and mineral fertilizers from Russia (65 percent 
of export) for ready-made products of the light and textile 
industry (62 percent of import) from China. 
  It is through border channels that Chinese firms "try the 
keys" to Russian raw materials, buying them on low prices and 
often bypassing quota-licenced state regulation. 
  Beijing's official governmental quarters have voiced an 
opinion that the export of Russian raw materials has been 
considerably facilitated through the CIS countries. This is 
assisted by customs benefits when taking goods out of Russia 
into the CIS states, as well as by the actual absence of real 
customs control on Russia's borders with new neighbouring 
countries. Quite often two sets of commodity-accompanying 
documents are registered for the same commodity: at Russia's 
custom house the commodity passes as a mutual delivery of the 
enterprises of Russia and CIS countries, and on the border of 
CIS states, with China--as Russia's transit export cargo. In 
1992, even as assessed by Chinese experts, 100 million dollars' 
worth of duly undeclared cargoes was taken out of Russia to 
China. 
  As far as state-to-state trade relations are concerned, at 
present they are regulated by the trade agreement of May 5, 
1992, and the technical inter-bank agreement of November 27, 
1992. In keeping with the latter, every form of payment, being 
determined in contracts by the buyer and seller, is permitted. 
Moreover, all settlements with the PRC are carried out solely in 
freely convertible currency (with the exception of credit 
operation). Specifically, China has granted Russia two commodity 
credits, while Russia has extended to China a credit for the 
construction with Russian participation of a nuclear power plant 
and a uranium-enrichment installation. State-to-state agreements 
and clearing settlements are used as the basis for exporting 
complete sets of equipment (mainly power industry equipment) and 
special facilities to China and to import consumer goods and 
foodstuffs (on applications from Russian plants supplying 
complete sets of equipment and special facilities). Moreover, 
the Chinese have cancelled all taxes on Russia's export and 
import.

  In the foreseeable future a major aspect of Russian-Chinese 
cooperation will evidently consist in the organization of border 
checkpoints, the construction of railroads, highways and bridge 
overpasses on the basis of Russian road-building equipment and 
Chinese manpower; the establishment of JVs in the sphere of 
river, sea and automobile transportations; shipbuilding and ship 
repair; the creation of a Russian-Chinese nonstate-owned air 
company, as well as the construction of the Metro planned in 
Harbin. In the PRC's north-eastern provinces, where many 
enterprises were built in the 1950s with assistance from the 
USSR, there is a need to renew plant and equipment and the 
machine-tool fleet by 7-8 percent annually. The enterprises are 
interested in importing machines and equipment and assembly from 
the CIS even for hard cash because this is much cheaper than 
their import from Japan and other developed countries. 
  To accelerate the development of North-East China, it is 
vitally important to have electric power the deficit of which is 
estimated at 20 percent. Therefore along with increasing the 
export of electricity from Buryatia, the Urkutsk and Chita 
regions, it is advisable to continue expanding cooperation in 
the construction of thermal power stations and nuclear power 
plants, and the corresponding infrastructure. 
  The talks held in August 1993 between G. Fadeyev, Russia's 
Minister of Railways, and his Chinese counterpart, Han Zhubin, 
demonstrated the sides' mutual concern for the solution of one 
of the most pressing problems of Russian-Chinese 
cooperation--that of transport. The Russian side suggested using 
our country's fleet of railway cars on China's roads and 
expanding the use of large-capacity containers. According to 
available estimates, up to 7,000 cars become accumulated from 
the Russian side in the areas of Manchuria-Zabaikalsk and 
Suifanhe-Grodekovo alone due to their shortage in China. But in 
1993 alone the volume of shipments needed to ensure mutual trade 
comprised six million tons. In China up to 70 percent of all 
cargoes are delivered by rail, and therefore closer coordination 
in this sphere amounts to an exceedingly important factor of 
economic cooperation between the two countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Bazhenova and Yuriy Katsman, with </F>
commentary by the Financial Transactions Department: "Funds of 
Private Individuals in the Bank for Foreign Economic Relations: 
`National Credit' Assumes the Problems of VEB Clients"] 
  [Text] Opportunities for transferring funds from 
accounts at the VEB [Bank for Foreign Economic Relations] being 
offered to private individuals by commercial banks stand out 
among the new services that have appeared on the Russian banking 
market. As a result, VEB clients will be given an opportunity to 
get back their foreign exchange funds without moral loss or 
waste of time, while the banks will be able to perceptibly 
increase their volume of outside funds. This is why the number 
of banks offering such services keeps growing. For example, 
yesterday the VEB signed an official contract with the National 
Credit Bank which gives the latter's clients preferential right 
to the return of funds from the VEB. 
  Despite about 10 banks now actively providing the service of 
transferring the funds of private individuals from the VEB, only 
two of them, the Savings Bank and National Credit, have official 
contracts with the VEB. The existence of a contract means that 
requests by private individuals to have funds transferred from 
the VEB to accounts at the Savings Bank or National Credit will 
be met on a priority basis. This operation is effected on the 
basis of a general sequence for banks that do not have such 
agreements (in particular, one of these banks is the Moscow 
branch of the Tveruniversalbank, which has been carrying out a 
vigorous campaign for the transfer of funds of VEB clients since 
the fall of 1993). 
  A client of the National Credit Bank must open an account at 
the bank and draw up the requisite petition in order to receive 
his funds from the VEB. National Credit guarantees the transfer 
of funds within six days; in the process, the owner of the funds 
is charged 1 percent of the amount as a commission to benefit 
the VEB. Foreign exchange funds may be placed in a current 
account or on deposit. The amount received may be withdrawn from 
a current account in cash, in full or in part (in this case, the 
commission comes to 1.5 percent), transferred to an account at 
another bank (a transfer within the CIS will cost a client $5, 
transfer abroad--$10). The bank will credit between 6.5 and 9.5 
percent annually to the balance in the account. The profit of 
clients from the placement of foreign exchange funds transferred 
from the VEB to deposits ranges between 7 and 16 percent. 
  In addition to traditional opportunities, clients of the 
National Credit Bank may purchase OLBI-Cards with funds received 
from the VEB. The minimum amount necessary to receive the card 
comes to $300 (annual interest on the deposit accrues at an 
annual rate of 9.5 percent), plus $14 which is the price put on 
the card itself. When cash is withdrawn with an OLBI-Card, a 5 
percent commission is charged. When goods are purchased, the 
owner of the card gets a 10 percent discount. 
  [Boxed item] 
<H5>  Commentary </H5>
  At present there are more than 3,000 petitions to transfer 
funds to other banks in the general card file of the VEB, and 
the number of petitions keeps growing. On average, transfers of 
funds on 400 petitions are effected during one banking day. 
However, despite an increase in the number of banks that offer 
their clients the service of transferring funds from the VEB, 
most depositors still prefer to get cash funds right away rather 
than use to this end accounts opened at other banks. In 
particular, a permanent waiting line of former VEB clients who 
wish to receive cash funds before the department of current 
accounts of the bank testifies to this. The opportunity for 
signing up to receive cash funds ahead of time does not improve 
the situation much because only about 250 clients of the VEB may 
sign up daily. [End of boxed item]

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Aspin: "American Investment: An American </F>
Mutual Fund Will Invest in Russia for the First Time"] 
  [Text] Until recently the possibility of 
institutionalizing the process of foreign investment in Russia 
seemed remote. Even the boldest classifications of world markets 
by Western institutional investors did not view Russia as a 
high-risk but potentially high-return financial market, 
preferring to just pass it over in silence. However, it appears 
that the incredible has happened: A large American finance 
company, Pioneer Group, Inc., yesterday announced its intention 
to invest on a large scale in the stock of enterprises from 
Russia and the CIS; the volume of such investment at the first 
stage will come to $3 million, and is expected to grow by 
another $100 million. This is the first case in which 
specifically institutional foreign investment in Russia has been 
organized. 
  Pioneer Group is one of the large American finance 
companies, 
which manages a family of "mutual" funds in the United States, 
Poland, India, and a number of other countries. The decision of 
the Pioneer Group to establish a mutual fund solely to invest in 
the Russian market represents the first case of an institutional 
approach to organizing capital investment in the Russian 
economy. It was no accident that the announcement of the Pioneer 
Group concerning the creation of the "Russian" mutual fund was 
timed to coincide with Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow. The 
important political aspect of the institutionalization of 
American investment was stressed in this manner. 
  In the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, two considerations at 
once compel a serious attitude towards the intention of the 
Pioneer Group to be the first American mutual fund to make money 
on the Russian stock exchange. First, the Pioneer Group has 
succeeded in winning considerable support from two influential 
Russian organizations--the Institute of Economics of the 
Transitional Period and the Association of Privatized and 
Private Enterprises. Both organizations have acted as founders 
of a Russian finance company established with the majority 
participation of the Pioneer Group. This company will manage 
financial resources raised by Pioneer in the United States and 
earmarked for investment in the Russian market. 
  Second, the Pioneer Group has the currently unique favorable 
experience of effectively managing financial resources in East 
European finance markets. Three years ago, this company 
established the first mutual fund in Poland, which within a very 
short period of time became the main institutional player in the 
financial market of that country, and introduced quite a number 
of financial techniques in the Polish market that were new to 
Poland (in particular, standards of professional investment 
analysis). In Poland, Pioneer also started out with $3 million; 
as of today, the amount of assets of the Polish fund exceeds 
$400 million. 
  The well-known international company Ernst and Young has 
been 
selected to be the main financial consultant and manager of the 
Pioneer project in Russia. According to an official Pioneer 
press release, this company was selected because its specialists 
have considerable experience and knowledge of the Russian 
market. In addition, Ernst and Young has an extensive 
international network. 
  KOMMERSANT experts note that the fact that mutual funds are 
organizing investment in the Russian economy may, in and of 
itself, serve as a reliable external indicator of a change in 
the quality of the Russian financial market. As the president of 
the Pioneer Group, John Cogan (John Cogan [name rendered in 
English in parentheses]), stated in yesterday's official press 
release, his experts have been following the evolution of the 
financial market of Russia for a long time. In Mr. Cogan's 
opinion, the current stage of development of privatization and 
structural changes in Russia's economy provide unique investment 
opportunities "for experienced investors" in the coming decade. 
  KOMMERSANT experts believe that the appearance of a 
professional American mutual fund in the Russian market will put 
Russian check funds into a serious competitive situation, 
especially with regard to a dialogue with privatized enterprises 
and organization of their effective transition to market 
conditions for economic operations. Besides, participation of a 
sizable amount of capital from Pioneer in operations on the 
stock and state securities market may influence the liquidity of 
these markets very beneficially.

<H5>  Pioneer Group--the First Foreign Mutual Fund in Poland </H5>
  Based on 1993 performance, operations of the Pioneer Polish 
fund turned out to be the third most profitable within the 
general structure of operations of the Pioneer family of mutual 
funds. Polish observers maintain that the presence of a powerful 
foreign institutional player became one of the reasons for the 
creation of a liquid market on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It is 
essential that the Pioneer Polish fund uses for its operations 
not only American investment but also contributions from Polish 
citizens by extensively distributing its stock in Poland. [End

  In the United States alone, Pioneer manages an entire 
"family" of mutual funds, of which Pioneer Bond, Pioneer Capital 
Growth, Pioneer Equity-Income, and Pioneer 1, 2, and 3 are the 
largest. Pioneer also manages funds in Poland, India, Taiwan, 
and a number of other countries. In its press release, Pioneer 
announced its intention to concentrate on the stock of 
privatized Russian enterprises. However, the investment strategy 
of Pioneer will be defined more clearly at the official 
presentation of the fund on 19 January.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Korotkova: "Importers of Goods Subject </F>
to Excise Tax Are Facing New Problems: The New Directive of the 
Customs Committee"] 
  [Text] Development of mechanisms for the 
implementation of the Customs Code provisions, which is 
currently being actively worked on by Russian GTK [State Customs 
Committee] specialists, unfortunately most often results in a 
considerable worsening of the export-import operations 
environment. The point is that despite good intentions--to 
ensure maximum budget revenues from customs duty--all documents 
that are being issued complicate considerably customs paperwork, 
which in practical terms nullifies the effectiveness of foreign 
trade deals. The Russia GTK's Order No. 549, "On Ensuring 
Payment of Customs Duties With Respect to Goods Subject to 
Excise Tax," the distribution of which to Russian customs points 
began yesterday, is no exception. 
  In keeping with the Russian GTK's new instruction, importers 
of goods subject to excise tax are required practically before 
the contract is fulfilled to transfer to the escrow account in 
the customs where the shipment eventually will be processed a 
deposit in an amount equal to the value of the expected customs 
duty. After the necessary amount is deposited with the internal 
customs, this information is to be sent to the customs point 
where the shipment will be crossing the border. Without this 
exchange of information between customs services, the goods will 
not permitted to enter Russia. Everything would seem to be 
clear. The goal that is pursued in this is to preclude the 
possibility of an import shipment "disappearing" on the way from 
the border to the customs clearing point and, correspondingly, 
to safeguard the treasury from loss of revenue. 
  This is where, however, the problems begin, which stem from 
the document provisions being insufficiently thought through and 
as a result nullifying all good intentions. First, the new rules 
for imports of goods subject to excise tax extend not only to 
regular imports, but also to re-export and transit. While with 
respect to re-export everything is more or less clear--the 
problems here mainly involve temporarily tying up the money, 
there is confusion with respect to goods coming through in 
transit. For instance, it is not clear how to treat the goods 
that are on consignment. Since the document does not cover at 
all the possibility of goods being delivered in the internal 
customs transit mode not only from the border but also from the 
customs warehouse, it turns out that whether to process or not 
to process the goods subject to excise tax under the new rules 
depends entirely on the individual customs inspector. 
  The necessity of ensuring that the route of goods delivery 
from abroad goes only through a specific border point where the 
permission to enter has been sent will create additional 
complications for importers. It is not always possible to 
foresee in which particular place some shipment or other will 
cross the border of Russia. One of the factors affecting this 
may be that a foreign company with whom the contract is signed 
may ship the goods, for instance, from one of its warehouses 
abroad. In addition, transport companies that make international 
deliveries plan their delivery route taking into consideration 
the interests of several clients simultaneously. Finally, the 
point of permitted border entry may be "wiped out by an 
avalanche" or end up in a war zone. But the simplest obstacle 
that makes this document virtually unworkable is customs itself, 
because of its imperfect system of operational record keeping 
and control over arriving goods, as well as poor training of 
customs officers. One way or the other, it is obvious that Order 
No. 549 and a number of recently issued documents regarding 
entry of goods subject to excise tax will reduce the number of 
their importers, which will have a detrimental effect both on 
retail trade and the state budget. 
  [Box, p 2] 
<H5>  From the Russian GTK's Order No 549 </H5>
  --Money with respect to goods being shipped shall be 
deposited in the escrow account of a customs organs in 
advance--before the goods actually cross the customs border of 
Russia, but no later than 10 calendar days before the expected 
date of the goods actually crossing the customs border of 
Russia. Money with respect to transit goods shall be deposited 
in the escrow account of a customs organ before transit goods 
actually cross the customs border of Russia. 
  --In the event that the customs organ at the departure point 
is not in possession of information permitting delivery of 
goods, or in the event that the amount of the security bond 
shown in the delivery control document (DCD) exceeds the amount 
actually deposited with the internal customs organ, the goods 
entering the country shall not be sent to the internal customs 
organ until the difference is deposited with the internal 
customs organs, with the exception of instances when the 
difference between said amounts results from a change in the ECU 
exchange rate. [End of boxed item]

<F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov: "The Ministry of Defense Is </F>
Exempted From Export Duties"] 
  [Text] The Russian Government continues the practice of 
granting key ministries substantial economic 
preferences--yesterday the government decree "On Exempting the 
Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation from Paying 
Customs Duty on Sales of Surplus Military Property in Foreign 
Markets" went into official distribution. 
  The substance of the new decree is quite simple. It 
formalizes the monopoly status of the Ministry of Defense in the 
foreign economic sphere, and it is made exempt (on top of that, 
retroactively to 1 June 1993) from paying customs duty of 
exported military property. In the past, the military had 
already been granted a number of preferences. In the president's 
edict "On the Procedures of Sale and Utilization of Surplus 
Military Property" dated 30 November 1992, the Ministry of 
Defense was given the status of the only middleman in selling 
military property outside of Russia and made exempt from paying 
tax on this income. 
  Despite the fact that the government decree undoubtedly will 
help to raise the level of social benefits of military 
servicemen (the proceeds from the sales of property are to be 
used for construction and acquisition of housing), the ministry 
itself also will get the opportunity to improve its material 
situation. As a result of the central administration of material 
resources and foreign economic relations of the Ministry of 
Defense, whose responsibility it is to sell military property in 
foreign markets, being exempted from paying taxes and export 
duties, the administration will be able to dictate to military 
units wishing to sell such surplus goods its own terms and 
prices. Besides, like any foreign trade monopoly, the 
administration takes a commission which, even within a 
"reasonable" range, makes a substantial addition to budget 
financing. On the whole, monopolization of foreign trade in the 
military sphere shows the increasing trend toward pushing 
commercial structures and private individuals out of foreign 
economic activities. 
  [Box, p 2] 
<H5>  Privileges Granted to the Russian Ministry of Defense </H5>
  --Sales and utilization of surplus military property (except 
arms and munitions) may be performed only by Ministry of Defense 
structures. 
  --The Ministry of Defense is exempted from paying all 
categories of taxes on the proceeds from sales of military 
property if these proceeds are directed at improving 
socioeconomic and housing conditions of servicemen. 
  --The Ministry of Defense is exempted from paying customs 
duty on export of surplus military property. [End of boxed item]

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Agareva: "Russia Introduces a Civilized </F>
Form of Mineral Resource Use: Production Sharing Agreements"] 
  [Text] Despite the Christmas holidays, the president 
of Russia's edict "Issues of Production Sharing Agreements in 
the Utilization of Natural Resources," signed on 24 December, 
did not escape the attention of Western companies. Their 
interaction with Russian authorities on production sharing terms 
now gets a legal base. At the same time, the Ministry of Fuels 
and Power Generation, in whose bowels the edict had been 
drafted, was swamped with inquiries. The ministry's first 
reaction to this avalanche of questions were clarifications made 
yesterday by the leaders of the group that drafted the 
edict--Gennadiy Shalmanov, chief of the main combined 
administration for legislative and legal-normative support, and 
Professor Aleksandr Perchik. 
  Until now, in the environment of legal uncertainty Western 
companies by necessity practiced the method of "sequential 
approximation," signing protocols of intentions and reaching 
agreements with the authorities of the federal and regional 
level. When it came to concrete decisions of project 
implementation, however, it would turn out that they either were 
in conflict with various instructions or were not envisaged by 
legislation. 
  The decree liquidates many blank spots and, according to 
Aleksandr Perchik, "is worth a law." First, the notion of 
"production sharing" becomes legitimized. Second, the parties 
that have a right to participate in an agreement are clearly 
defined. Investors are not limited to legal entities--a group of 
subjects without setting up a legal entity now falls under the 
definition. The point in question is legalization of consortiums 
that have already de facto emerged in Russia--in particular, 
when Sakhalin-1 and Sakhalin-2 tenders were conducted--but in 
legal terms lived a precarious existence. Third, it is specified 
that the state may participate in the agreement either as itself 
or as represented by a state company that is carrying out 
appropriate instructions--such a company may participate 
directly in the project implementation. 
  Of keenest interest to foreign investors are the issues of 
taxation and regulation of export of the share of the output due 
them. The decree substantially reduces the number of taxes the 
investors will have to pay. There are only two now: the tax on 
profit and a fee for mineral resource use, which, in the opinion 
of the authors, will permit the circumstances of every deposit's 
development to be treated in a flexible manner. In the event 
that the deposit is rather difficult, the production sharing 
agreement may specify terms that will ensure that a foreign 
investor will get an adequate return, which will remove the need 
to beg for additional preferences. In addition, the imported 
equipment brought in for the project implementation is exempted 
from the value-added tax and customs duties. 
  Raw materials that constitute a foreign investor's share by 
the terms of agreement may be exported "in keeping with 
procedures set for export of home-produced output." This means 
that exporting them does not require quotas and licenses. At the 
same time, these procedures do not relieve exporters of 
strategic materials (a joint enterprise or a foreign company) of 
the requirement to register with the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations, which undoubtedly reduces the attractiveness 
of production sharing agreements for foreign investors. 
  The future of the edict is not entirely clear. In any event, 
it will be submitted to the Federal Assembly for approval and 
most likely will indeed be approved. It is possible, however, 
that the deputies will then decide to revive the consideration 
of the draft law "On Concessions and Other Agreements Entered 
With Foreign Investors," which also includes regulation of 
production sharing relations--especially considering that this 
draft law had been adopted by the Supreme Soviet in the second 
reading but was not signed by the president because of the 
exacerbation of the political situation in the country. 
  The edict's weak point is that it bypasses the issue of the 
regions' powers in attracting foreign investors into cooperative 
ventures on production sharing terms. The edict assumes that the 
current process of property division between the Federation and 
its components will be completed without conflicts. Meanwhile, 
the draft law contained a rather precisely defined mechanism for 
division of powers, which the lawmakers can easily resurrect. 
Besides, it envisaged the possibility of exempting foreign 
investors who are parties to production sharing agreements from 
the requirement to register as special exporters. It is quite 
possible, however, that this norm may be dropped from the final 
version of the law. 
  [Box, p 2] 
<H3>  The Edict `Issues of Production Sharing Agreements in the 
Utilization of Natural Resources' </H3>
  --retains the requirement to obtain a mineral resource use 
license 
  --legalizes consortiums as a form for a group of investors 
to 
join together without forming a legal entity 
  --permits exports of mineral raw materials that become the 
property of the investor as home-produced by the investor 
  --exempts imports of producer goods within the boundaries of 
the implementation of a production sharing agreement from import 
duties and the value-added tax 
  --leaves capital assets newly created in the course of 
project implementation in the ownership of the investor unless 
specified otherwise in the agreement 
  --keeps the provisions of a production sharing agreement in 
effect for the entire term of the agreement regardless of 
whether Russia adopts legislative norms that may have a 
detrimental effect on the commercial results of the investor's 
activities under the production sharing agreement

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Zagorodnyaya: "Immunity to Political </F>
Events in Russia Increases: Russia in the World Markets"] 
  [Text] The meeting of the world's leading producers 
of aluminum, which begins in Brussels today and where the volume 
of Russian exports of this metal to Europe will be discussed, as 
well as Yegor Gaydar's resignation, which he announced last 
weekend, have presented us with a pretext for analyzing the 
influence of political and economic happenings in Russia on the 
results of trading at world exchanges last year. Having 
evaluated the degree of such impact, KOMMERSANT experts came to 
the conclusion that the state of the world market is becoming 
decreasingly sensitive to political events in Russia, while 
attention to economic news from Russia is on the rise. On the 
basis of this, one may assume that Russia's position at the 
Brussels meeting will become a major factor to influence the 
state of the market in aluminum. As to a possible reshuffling in 
the Russian Government, most likely they will not cause 
considerable fluctuations in the rates of foreign currencies, 
financial instruments, and commodity futures prices. 
  The idea of interdependence between economic and political 
events in Russia and the state of the world markets is not new; 
actually, the history of the past two years presents prominent 
examples of this two-pronged impact. While keeping in mind that 
Russian reforms in many respects depend on the world state of 
the market, let us look at the opposite correlation: how events 
in Russia influenced the world markets in 1993. I will take the 
liberty of suggesting that looking at the still-recent past is 
quite useful for determining the attitude toward events in which 
the current week and the entire of 1994 will be rich. Having 
evaluated the degree of impact that the events in Russia had on 
the state of leading international exchanges in 1993 and 
compared it to the analogous results of the preceding year, we 
may draw the conclusion that by now world trade has developed 
sort of an immunity to political news from Russia. At the same 
time, reports of a purely economic nature attract great 
attention among the traders. Hence, one may forecast a lack of 
reaction on the part of the world markets to Gaydar's latest 
statement and at the same time the significance of Russia's 
position at the Brussels meeting that begins today for future 
development of the price situation in the world market of 
aluminum. 
  The most noticeable reaction of the world market 
to the political events in Russia was registered after Boris 
Yeltsin's television address to the Russian people on 20 March. 
Let us remind our readers that on that day the president of 
Russia announced that he had signed a number of edicts, among 
them "On Special Rule Until the Resolution of the Crisis of 
Authority," which envisaged holding on 25 April a vote of 
confidence in the president and the government. On 22 March, the 
indices of leading European stock exchanges dropped, gold prices 
went up sharply, and the dollar rose in relation to the German 
mark. For instance, at the close of trading at the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange stock prices collapsed: In one day of trading, 
the exchange's index dropped by almost 3 percent, the 
explanation for which, in the opinion of local analysts, was 
close economic ties between Germany and Russia. Higher gold 
prices were registered on that day at all exchanges trading in 
this metal, without exception, and it caused a chain reaction of 
rising prices for the entire group of precious metals: silver, 
platinum, and palladium. At the London Metals Exchange, nickel 
and aluminum prices went up, since British traders were certain 
that deliveries of these metals from Russia would not proceed on 
schedule. As to oil traders, they were the first to manifest the 
signs of immunity to Russian political events as early as in the 
beginning of 1993. Therefore, in March, when all exchange 
dealers in the world were playing almost solely under the 
influence of forecasts of the political future of Russia, oil 
traders raised the raw material prices only slightly (by 10 
cents--to $18.78 per barrel of brent-blend) and later very 
quickly adjusted prices down. 
  Later on, a very interesting trend began to manifest itself 
in the world markets: The significance of Russian events for 
Russia itself kept increasing, while the intensity of reaction 
to them in the world markets was waning. Some very interesting 
statements could be heard at international oil exchanges at the 
beginning of October. The dissolution of the Russian parliament 
and the siege of the White House elicited these comments from 
oil traders: "After all, the parliament is not engaged in oil 
exports, and therefore there is no need to anticipate a rise." 
By the way, oil prices did rise a little earlier--not as a 
result of political news, but because rumors circulated in the 
markets that the volume of shipping of Russian oil from 
Novorossiysk had dropped. 
  An almost complete absence of reaction in the 
world markets to the preliminary results of the 12 December 
elections leads to an assumption that international financial 
life has adapted itself completely to the so-called Russian 
factor. On the other hand, the waning interest in Russian 
political cataclysms is accompanied by intensified attention to 
economic factors, especially changes in real volumes of raw 
material exports, which at this point remain the main source of 
Russia's foreign currency income. Such attitudes apparently will 
persist in the coming year, which should be taken into account 
by those Russian entrepreneurial structures that play in 
international financial and commodity markets.

the situation in the world currency, stock, and commodity 
exchanges, the unit of measure was one point. It corresponds to 
one percentage point of change in the currency exchange rate, 
commodity prices, or a stock exchange index as compared to the 
corresponding average level over the week preceding the event. 
Among items factored into the calculation were fluctuations of 
the dollar rate in relation to the German mark and Japanese yen, 
stock exchange indices in London, Frankfurt, Paris, New York, 
Sydney, and Tokyo, and commodity quotations in contracts for 
gold, platinum, palladium, oil, aluminum, and nickel.

"NATO and the Eurasian Interests of Russia. As We Improve 
Relations With the North Atlantic Alliance, May We Not Damage 
Them With China"] 
  [Text] To this day, mutual relations between Russia and the 
North Atlantic alliance have not been conceptually substantiated 
by either side. Two significant questions are being left out of 
the scope of all discussions of this topic underway in Russia: 
the key historic task Moscow is now facing and Russian interests 
in Asia. The issue of whether Russia will join NATO or not may 
also be resolved once answers to these questions have been set 
forth. 
  It is obvious that it is necessary to overcome, as soon as 
possible, the state of a humiliated great power with a 
dilapidated economy and a disfigured national self-awareness. 
The main historic task follows from this--to turn within a short 
period of time into a great multinational democratic state with 
a market economy which has a worthy position in the world. 
  The strategy of blending into the world economy should be 
implemented in the areas where this runs into the least 
resistance and begets the greatest cooperation. In other words, 
centers of economic power which, for objective reasons, are 
interested in the least discriminatory cooperation with Russia 
are its natural partners in the outside world. Geographical 
neighbors who, proceeding from considerations of their own 
security, are interested in the preservation of at least a 
stable Russia may be classified as such. 
  Taking into account the Eurasian affiliation of our country, 
it is easy to understand that in the European area, all of the 
above refers primarily to the European Union and its core of 
integration, France and Germany. In the Asian area, it is 
primarily China which is quickly growing into an economic giant. 
  Therefore, a simultaneous and parallel, primarily economic 
rapprochement with both West Europe and China should form the 
foundation of a foreign policy strategy. 
  It will become clear that there is no alternative to 
friendly 
relations with our Asian neighbor if we take into account that 
Russia has the longest land border with China, that China is a 
state with a population of 1 billion, and that it has nuclear 
potential. It may be said without exaggeration that now that the 
threat of a nuclear world war has disappeared, relations between 
Russia and China are more important than relations with the 
United States from the point of view of ensuring Russia's 
security. 
  The role of China in ensuring Russian interests associated 
with economic security is also great. The Chinese leadership is 
striving to modernize its armed forces. At present, when many 
defense enterprises in Russia are on the brink of economic 
demise, even insignificant purchases of armaments by China and 
military-technical cooperation with it are helping the survival 
of our plants, which concentrate the elite of the 
scientific-technical intelligentsia and workers, along with 
unique high technology and experience. 
  Without a doubt, the possible admission to NATO will deal a 
blow to the good-neighbor relations between Russia and China. We 
would like to recall that a joint Russian-Chinese declaration 
signed during the visit by President Yeltsin to China in 
December 1992 said directly that the sides undertook to refrain 
from participation in military-political alliances aimed against 
one another. The Chinese will most likely view Russia's 
membership in NATO as a direct violation of these agreements, as 
a powerful association of European nations against Asian nations. 
  It is also beyond a doubt that, reacting to Russia's 
membership in NATO, China will take measures in response--it 
will begin to wind down economic cooperation and will boost the 
military budget and the strength of Chinese troops concentrated 
at the Russian-Chinese border. 
  Therefore the proposal concerning possible NATO membership 
for Russia, lucrative at first sight, actually brings about a 
perceptible deterioration in its security conditions in Asia, 
complications in the course of economic reforms, and 
restrictions on independence in foreign policy. Russia's 
membership in NATO is not in line with its strategic interests. 
However, this is not at all to say that Russia should give up 
cooperation with NATO in the course of ensuring European 
security. 
  Certain frictions and contradictions, including territorial 
disputes, exist between the former socialist countries of 
Central and East Europe. The possibility of armed conflicts 
developing between them, i.e., in the vicinity of Russia's 
western borders, cannot be ruled out. It is impossible to do 
without drawing NATO and Russia into the settlement of these 
conflicts. This is why care should be taken in advance to create 
a mechanism for interaction between Russia and the alliance, 
possibly through the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. Conflicts should be settled under the mandates of the 
United Nations or the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, with both NATO and Russia being brought in. 
Participation of other CIS member states is also possible. In 
the process, Russia should act as a partner of NATO on an equal 
footing rather than a member, with not only the peacemaking 
forces but their command being joint. The American Partnership 
for Peace program lays a foundation for this. 
  As far as security guarantees to the former socialist 
countries in Europe are concerned, Russia should encourage their 
rapprochement with the European Union and the Western European 
Union--the defense structure of West Europe. In the process 
Russia should firmly argue for its negative attitude toward 
their possible admission to NATO. This approach will gain 
support from Europists, i.e. proponents of restoring the 
erstwhile role of Europe as the center of world civilization, 
the leadership of the European Union and the Western European 
Union, and Germany. This approach will ensure the much-desired 
Western security guarantees for former socialist countries. 
  The signing of a treaty on partnership and cooperation 
between Russia and the European Union which is planned for this 
year and its implementation will dispel apprehensions existing 
here with regard to the possible isolation of Russia from the 
West. On the other hand, with this strategy in the Western area, 
freedom of actions in Asia is retained in full, in particular, 
an opportunity to maintain good-neighbor relations with China. 
  In turn, the transformation of the Conference on Security 
and 
Cooperation in Europe from an amorphous forum into a strong 
international organization, with its own Security Council and 
peacemaking forces capable of preventing and extinguishing armed 
conflicts quickly, should become the main avenue for creating a 
common European security system.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Gorbachev under the rubric "Carte </F>
Blanche": "The NATO Summit in Brussels: Time of Missed 
Opportunities"] 
  [Text] As it became history, the old year, which had seen 
so much anxiety and so many emotional experiences, left its 
problems unsolved. No solutions were found to them in either 
Russia, or the United States, or West Europe, or East Europe, 
which have been drawn into processes of profound changes. Nobody 
accomplished either domestic or key foreign tasks. 
  Therefore, the new year holds in store for us events that 
will have serious consequences. What consequences these will be 
depends on those on whom the responsibilities of the state to 
both their nations and the world devolve. 
  The NATO summit in Brussels which has just ended is one such 
event. I am afraid that it will be remembered as a meeting of 
missed opportunities. They could have finally pondered at the 
summit what Europe should be after the discontinuation of the 
cold war, and set forth the foundation of its common security. 
However, far-fetched and superficial problems and emotions 
prevailed over the fundamental tasks that were on the agenda. 
  The countries of East and Central Europe and the three 
Baltic 
republics are asking to be admitted to NATO. Fear of a revival 
of imperial claims by Russia and even aggression by it is the 
main argument. At any rate, this is what was seen on the surface 
and what the discussion was about. 
  However, this amounted to evading the main point, which is 
to 
make a determination as to what U.S. interests in Europe are, 
what the new essence of Europe itself is, and what is meant by 
this--between the Atlantic Ocean and Smolensk, between the 
Atlantic Ocean and the Urals, or between Vancouver and 
Vladivostok, and, finally, what Russia's place in a new Europe 
is. It is precisely these three issues that should have been on 
the agenda. As long as these issues are not clarified, in other 
words, as long as no answer is found to the question of what the 
world should be like after the cold war, the development of a 
correct strategy for this world will be impossible. The European 
Union, the United States, NATO, the Western European Union, CIS 
countries, and the countries of Central and East Europe will be 
doomed to hesitation, improvisation, and mistakes which pose a 
threat to all. 
  It is not possible to solve narrow problems without a global 
approach, either. I see both the hasty aspiration to move NATO 
borders eastward and the Partnership for Peace course as major 
dangers. 
  Let us begin with the former. Transforming the countries of 
East and Central Europe into members of the present-day NATO is 
a direct path toward new splits in Europe, toward "curtains" and 
demarcation lines. Whether they want it or not, this will mean a 
return to confrontation and, therefore, a thwarting of the 
positive processes that have been initiated in recent years, 
with great difficulty. 
  However, Partnership for Peace is not acceptable, either. It 
has been thought up in order to buy time. The United States does 
not wish NATO to expand because, among other things, this may 
bring about a weakening of the role of NATO as an instrument of 
American policy. This plan is being passed off as a cautious 
move to accommodate the countries of Central and East Europe. It 
is believed that it should not put Russia on its guard. However, 
let us call things by their true names. Partnership for Peace 
means bringing the NATO infrastructure closer to the borders of 
Russia gradually (it cannot be done any other way), with all the 
attendant consequences: joint military maneuvers and movements 
of NATO armed forces in immediate proximity to the borders of 
Russia. 
  Is it not clear that the aspiration of America, which is not 
openly acknowledged, to not just retain and reinforce its 
influence in Western Europe but to also expand its authoritative 
presence in the eastern part of Europe, is the subtext to this 
idea? The United States has not decided yet what its role is 
going to be under the new European conditions, but for now it is 
laying its hands on everything that appears within reach. We 
must tell our American friends: Such behavior geared toward a 
unipolar world cannot but cause irritation in Russia, which they 
wish in this manner to remove from the superpower framework. 
Under the pretext of the allegedly possible turn by Russia to an 
imperial policy, the United States itself gives us reason to 
suspect it of imperial intentions. At any rate, the course 
toward expanding NATO will be perceived in Russia as an attempt 
to isolate it. However, it is impossible to isolate Russia. This 
would amount to ignoring both history and reality and, 
therefore, it is not a policy. 
  They might refer to certain pronouncements to the effect 
that 
Russia may also join NATO at some point. However, this makes no 
sense. If the discussion is indeed about a security system for a 
"Greater Europe," then let us create and perfect the relevant 
structures of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. Of course, there would be a place for a profoundly 
transformed NATO among them. However, why impose an instrument 
which served the cold war for accomplishing a completely 
different task? 
  I will repeat once again what I told George Bush in London 
before the G-7 meeting in 1991: You must decide what kind of 
Soviet Union you wish to see. At present, Clinton must decide 
what kind of Russia he wishes to see. If the United States 
indeed wants Russia to participate in building a new Europe and 
developing a new world policy, the United States must learn to 
do business with Russia on an equal footing, and proceed from 
long-term interests and realistic assessments instead of giving 
in to momentary temptations to take advantage of Russia's 
temporary weakness. 
  The response in Russia will be negative otherwise, 
regardless 
of the position its government takes. An affront to its prestige 
and interests will run into resistance and indignation from all 
kinds of both government and oppositional circles--patriotic and 
nationalistic, conservative and reformist. Disrespect for Russia 
and resuscitation of the NATO bugaboo at its borders plays 
primarily into the hands of antireformist and anti-Western 
countries [as published]. 
  The assumption that today's and tomorrow's Russia will once 
again impose its imperial will on other countries by force is 
absurd. It is a consequence of major mistakes in assessments of 
the political and psychological situation in my country. It 
concerns me that politicians who are inclined toward this line 
of reasoning exist. The results of the December elections are 
used to confirm such apprehensions. 
  Actually, these results are an inevitable consequence of the 
erroneous course of reforms. The elections became an expression 
of a mass protest by the people. At present not only the Russian 
leadership but also those who have been urging it along this 
path for two years now should think seriously and 
self-critically. There already are some signs of such thinking. 
Even Yeltsin acknowledged the existence of extensive popular 
discontent, albeit without particular enthusiasm. Mr. Strobe 
Talbott, one of the principal apologists of a radical course in 
Russia, is now calling on the Kremlin to use "more therapy and 
less shock." In turn, U.S. Vice President Al Gore proposes not 
following IMF recommendations literally. Well, better late then 
never. However, it appears that in America they have not yet 
fully appreciated what is happening, and are not prepared to 
draw due conclusions from their own mistakes. President Clinton 
has excessively personalized his unconditional support for 
reforms by the shock-therapy method. He will now have to take a 
more realistic look at the Russian political panorama. 
  I have repeatedly warned, both at home and in the West, that 
the course of Gaydar and the radical democrats cannot bring 
about positive results. As the outcome of the elections 
testifies, by now most Russians have grasped that, first, the 
course of the president and the government has failed and, 
second, the West also shares the responsibility for supporting 
this failed course so unreservedly. At present, it is important 
to avoid steps that would promote the growth of anti-Western 
sentiment on the part of many Russians. 
  Does the outcome of the elections mean that fascism is a 
real 
threat in Russia? Does it mean that Zhirinovskiy or someone 
similar will end up in power? I absolutely do not believe so. 
This turn of events would run counter to the mentality of 
Russians, their experience in steadfast struggle against fascist 
aggression and occupation, and their life under totalitarianism. 
  Or else, has the West already decided that, between 1985 and 
the present day, Russia has failed to see and acknowledge 
democratic values, and that the lesson of the failure of the 
August putsch has been forgotten? Of course, there is a frenzied 
reactionary wing, people who wave a red cloth before the noses 
of the electorate exhausted by adversity. Such people or similar 
people exist in all democratic states, and it would be 
surprising if we did not have them. They cannot be mistaken for 
those who express the opinion of the people. 
  Of course, forces that are hard to characterize at present 
may get the upper hand, among whom there will certainly be the 
military--if no policy changes follow, if the poorest people are 
not protected, and if there is no support for domestic 
producers. I hope that this can still be avoided. If it comes to 
something of this nature, a presidential election and new 
elections to the parliament should immediately be held, and a 
government of broad popular support should be created. However, 
in any event it is absurd to talk about the possibility of the 
rebirth of an empire and aggressiveness with regard to the 
entire world. Not everyone in Russia has lost their mind. 
  Returning to the communist past is impossible. Forces that 
would be in a position to lead to this do not exist. It makes no 
sense to be anxious about it. However, it is also necessary for 
the West to respect the results of the elections, which make it 
clear that the Russian people demand a change in the current 
policy. Political support for reforms from the people is 
natural, but enough of advice on how to conduct reforms by 
methods that are impossible in our country. Russia needs 
clear-cut "rules of the game" in economic relations in order to 
attract private investment; cooperation is needed in 
rejuvenating our powerful machine building which, incidentally, 
will generate many additional jobs for the West. It is necessary 
to remove economic barriers and open Western markets to more 
than just our raw materials. 
  It is necessary to finally acknowledge that Russia will have 
to find its own path for a transition from totalitarianism to 
democracy. There are no precedents or analogies for such a 
transition. Three generations have grown up in a certain 
environment, and for this reason classical IMF models are not 
applicable here. They are meant for market economies in need of 
recovery. In this instance, at issue is the creation of 
everything anew on absolutely specific, historically conditioned 
grounds, and, not least, a fundamental transformation of the 
public mentality. It will be good for all if President Clinton 
has grasped this reality of ours when he comes to Moscow.

<F P=106> [Article in two installments by Seydakhmet Quttyqadam: "What </F>
Are the Politicians Going To Do for Us?"] 
<H5>  [23 Oct p 2] </H5>
  [Text] It would be difficult for any observant, thinking 
person witnessing the flow of specific political events in 
Kazakhstan to be an optimist. Such a person would be forced to 
observe clearly the difficulty of extricating ourselves from a 
crisis which embraces every area of the life of our young 
nation. Those with power in their hands, instead of struggling 
heroically against the dangerous problems hanging over our 
heads, stick their heads in the creeping sand dunes and give 
themselves to sweet political dreams, thereby resembling amorous 
prairie hens seeking to comfort each other. They are like some 
seer prophesying in advance that there must be disaster. It is 
no wonder that the very worst projections become reality these 
days. 
  However, it is still not easy to agree with the statement 
that there are no energies being expended on well-thought-out 
and creative efforts, capable of depriving us of the [vain] 
hopes we are so fond of due to peculiarities of human nature, 
and of turning back the dangerous flow of events in our society. 
These efforts should be aimed at ordinary people with the intent 
of removing them from indolence and awakening them from the 
present state which saps strength and ardor. 
  One of the fires of hope, glowing in the hearts of the 
people, is the fact that there is no doubt about the activism of 
the political structures. They should be capable of taking upon 
their own shoulders responsibility for the fate of a nation, 
which has lost its potential for happiness, and for the fate of 
a worn out people. Only those who are not endeavoring to take 
power into their hands solely for the sake of power will achieve 
victory. All of this is going on under very complex 
circumstances. There is unprecedented economic crisis. The 
people are becoming impoverished. General social dejection and 
desperation is growing. The government is incapable of ruling 
the country. There is a cold wind of a bloody future civil war 
in Russia. There is the unabashed arrogance in that country's 
relations with us. Separatist notions are on the rise in some 
regions. Relations are tense to a considerable degree among 
representatives of executive and legislative authority. Also... 
the season for new elections to parliament is here. 
  Before reviewing the shape of politics in the Republic, it 
would seem proper to explain our terminology. Indeed, according 
to the "traditional" explanation, there are revolutionaries on 
the left, reformists, i.e., centrists, and conservatives on the 
right. However, under our present conditions these definitions 
do not in fact correspond to the real state of affairs. (Since 
it would take a great deal of time to prove this I will let it 
go.) We should define the terms as follows: the "leftists" are 
those supporting an emphasis on returning to their political 
heritage of only a short time ago; the "rightists" support 
nationalist movements and traditions; the "centrists" support 
reforms and a consensus of the entire people. The fact is that 
we should forget this division as a given. However, lacking such 
a set division, we should remember that it will be extremely 
difficult to classify political movements. 
  Thus we divide all the political structures in Kazakhstan 
into the following groupings: 
  1) socialists, i.e., the Socialist Party (QSP [Qazaqstan 
Sotsialistik Partiya]), the Social Democratic Party (QSDP 
[Qazaqstan Sotsial-Demokratiyalyq Partiya]), the Communist Party 
(QKP [Qazaqstan Kommunistik Partiya]), and neocommunist 
organizations, i.e., the local Branch of the All-Union Communist 
Party (BK[b]P), the Communist Union (in Qaraghandy City), and 
others; 
  2) centrists, i.e., the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union 
(QKhBO [Qazaqstan Khalyq Birligi Odaghy]), the People's Congress 
(QKhK [Qazaqstan Khalyq Kongresi]), the Democratic Progress 
Party (QDPP [Qazaqstan Demokratiyalyq Progress Partiyasy]), the 
recently formed Party for the Development of Rights (QQDP 
[Qazaqstan Quqyqtyq Damu Partiyasy]), and others; 
  3) rightists, i.e., the National Democratic Party, the 
Civil "Azat" Movement, the Republican Party (QRP [Qazaqstan 
Respubliqalyq Partiya]), the "Alash" National Liberation Party 
(secret movement), the Kazachestvo Movement, and others; 
  4) among the social and environmental movements there are 
mixed groups formed by the Almaty Workers Movement, the Farmers' 
Party, and the "Tabighat [Nature]" Party for Justice and the 
Flourishing of the Environment. 
  There is no doubt that other structures, centers such as the 
Independent Labor Union Center, the Federation of Labor Unions, 
trade unions belonging to individual independent sector 
industries, and national and cultural centers and societies have 
a certain degree of influence on the political atmosphere of the 
republic. 
  Four parties and movements merit special mention due to 
their 
particular weight today among varied parties, movements, and 
sects. They are: the Kazakhstan Socialist Party, the Kazakhstan 
Peoples Congress, the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union, and the 
Civil "Azat" Movement. 
  Let us now look at the kind of potentialities each of them 
has. 
  I. Kazakhstan Socialist Party 
  The Kazakhstan Socialist Party is the party of persons, 
weary 
of taking responsibility for crimes committed by others on their 
shoulders. The last congress of the Communist Party and the 
First Congress of the Socialist Party took place in September of 
1991. Since that time it has been forced to do a great deal of 
searching in order to find its political way in new 
circumstances. Thereby, the party strives to maintain a 
social-reformist direction and to be true to the socialist 
heritage. In the end, this party has made known that it supports 
democracy, a market economy, the independence of Kazakhstan, and 
social protection of the people. At the same time the party has 
made known that it is not against the closest possible 
integration within the framework of the CIS, even the 
establishment of confederative relations and the formation of 
structures that are extra-national. 
  The total number of Socialists (according to information 
from 
the Ministry of Justice dated 17 July, 1993) is 47,240 persons, 
and there were 1,586 primary party organizations as of December, 
1992. 
  The party has a special apparatus formed from a very fine 
organizational structure, and officials experienced in activism. 
  However, since Nursultan Nazarbayev publicly announced his 
support for the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union, there has been 
much uncertainty among the ranks of members, among which are 
activist members. There has been observed a trend among them to 
pass over to the party of the president. 
  Hitherto, the Kazakhstan Socialist Party has supported the 
policies of the government. However, now the criticism of the 
government has begun to grow gradually. They have said that it 
is carrying out its regular policies poorly, that it does not 
understand reform models correctly, and that it is growing apart 
from the people. This party did not take part in the "round 
table" held in the capital. The reason, as the party made clear, 
is that a "round table" is a poor way for creating solidarity 
among the parties. However, the real reason was the cool 
relationships among the leading figures of the party. 
  At present this party is distancing itself from its former 
policies, and has begun to seek new slogans and new methods of 
work. However, when these efforts expose socialist ideology 
itself, they are no easy thing. The first issue of the newspaper 
RESPUBLIKA has appeared. Set forth there, on the eve of the 
election campaign, are party tactics and a draft of the basic 
platform of the Socialist Party. The success of the party will 
now depend to a considerable degree on how they are able to put 
these tactics into practice. 
  It would seem that the attitude of the chairman of the 
Kazakhstan Socialist Party, Anwar Alimzhanov, favoring, more or 
less, the need to closely follow the party line and to hold the 
reins as tight as possible in a time of consolidation, is not 
entirely suited to these times. For that reason, criticism of 
him has intensified even from among those closest to him. 
  At present it is difficult to say exactly what the fate of 
the party will be, and how much success it will gain in the 
struggle to elect deputies. However, if we remember the social 
circumstances of a people in a very difficult state and the 
strengthening of the longing for the past socialist way of life, 
this party cannot be disregarded. Under certain circumstances it 
would not be surprising if its influence increased radically. At 
present the Kazakhstan Socialist Party needs a powerful and bold 
leader who will be able to mobilize the ranks of the party 
closely around him, and who will know how to unify all the 
leftist movements. If this need is met, the party could become a 
very powerful political force. 
  II. The Kazakhstan People's Unity Union 
  The Kazakhstan People's Unity Union appeared on the Republic 
political scene after the proclamation of the Announcement of 
the 34 on 5 February, 1993. Those individuals, stirring things 
up at various levels, have in general begun to become members. 
For that reason the opponents of this party have referred to it 
as a "nomenclatura" party or a "government party." The party's 
abbreviated name, QXBO, is understood as "Kazakhstan Union of 
Rich Members of the Nomenclatura." 
  However, the organizers of the Union have begun to show that 
those who say this are not correct. This is because the persons 
signing the Announcement of the 34 were representatives of the 
broad ranks of the Kazakh intelligentsia, and there are many 
young representatives among them. Likewise, we think the fact 
that Serik Abdirakhmanov, chosen chairman of the Political 
Kenges of the Union, has begun criticism of the establishment 
will make possible the repulse of whatever the pronouncement [of 
criticism] we lay on. 
  The Union has a policy line of centrist character. However, 
the members of the People's Congress Party claim that the ideas 
of the Union were stolen from them. It is difficult to say now 
how just this accusation against the party is. However, it 
cannot be denied that the platforms of the two parties have a 
certain similarity. At the same time it must be admitted that, 
in general terms, the centrist views of the party are different 
in their universality. On top of that it is a known fact that 
Nursultan Nazarbayev has for some time given his blessing to the 
ideas of the Union. 
  This gave Nazarbayev the opportunity to have his own 
political philosophies carried out in the hands of S. 
Abdirakhmanov without the latter making any reference to 
himself. In fact Abdirakhmanov had become the owner of a 
powerful political organization that has relied on the 
employment of higher political groups. A large fund called 
"Yelim-ay" has been established and the mass media, according to 
instructions sent down from above, widely propagandized the 
Union he headed. 
  However, the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union has been unable 
to be a purely mass or an authoritative organization. It does 
not know how to use its potentialities efficiently. For that 
reason, a resolution has been enacted on the eve of the 
parliamentary elections regarding a change in party leadership. 
Vice-Premier Qwanysh Sultanov, a well-known politician, was 
chosen in place of Abdirakhmanov. At the same time, a great 
event took place in the history of the Union. Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, who had hitherto stood as an experienced wise man 
between the Kazakhstan People's Congress and the Union, not 
turning "to the right or to the left," now moved somewhat to the 
right, and made the decision to make known the conditions under 
which he would become the public leader of the party. 
  These two events would have shaken things up in other 
parties 
or movements. Some made known the criticism that "we have gotten 
the president interested by scaring his side." They began to 
scold Nursultan Nazarbayev for having missed the paternal truth 
offered to all their political children. Dashing cold water on 
the subject was the question to Qwanysh Sultanov: "how is it 
proper to combine an appointment in the government with a party 
office?" The debate: "is the Union a party or is it not a party" 
again gained ground. 
  However, it is clear to any person with vision that such a 
change had to take place sooner or later. This is because it is 
well known that Nursultan Nazarbayev could not continue to 
remain his own man indefinitely. He is the kind of man, in fact, 
needed by a party. At the same time, he now needs a party 
faithfully devoted to himself. Likewise, he needs a powerful 
political party to defend his interests against the 
establishments. There is a great deal of dispute about the 
Kazakhstan People's Unity Union, but it is a political union 
with more than 70,000 persons in its ranks, and it has branches 
in almost every oblast of the republic. We should not worry so 
much about the identity of the party. For this above all results 
will be important. 
  In connection with the appearance of a new party chief and a 
new party official leader, the role played by the Union in 
republic political life has changed considerably, something 
which is in any case well known. Qwanysh Sultanov is full of 
energy; he is intelligent and competent, shrewd, and a 
politician who is painstaking in what he does. He knows well the 
rules of the political events taking place within the scope of 
the republic and the secrets of responsible internal politics. 
  There was a reason why he was chosen Union party chief. If 
we 
bear in mind the well-known disputes about his election among 
the higher political leaders, and especially among the branches 
of government power, we understand that the confidence placed in 
him is extremely great. At present Qwanysh Sultanov is 
completely involved in party work, and is devoting his efforts 
to establishing very good order there quickly and, to 
reestablishing in the shortest possible time the Kazakhstan 
People's Unity Union as a resourceful and clearly-defined party 
in contrast to its present careless state. However, in 
connection with his own political biography, Sultanov has a 
reputation for shrewdness and strives to "measure seven times 
and cut once." He is not going to recreate the ship of the 
party, and he is not going to change the party command all that 
greatly. He, fundamentally, will work with the material he has 
in hand. For that reason he is striving as quickly as possible 
to gain control of all vacancies under the influence of the 
organizational nomenklatura in his administration. However, it 
will not be so easy to exert a positive influence in other 
areas. Nonetheless, under circumstances where the Union plays 
the role of party No. 1, he will be able to increase hopes 
through his own influence. 
  There are experienced units of people playing an activist 
role in the ranks of the party. At present it has a sufficient 
number of powerful leaders. However, there is a need for clever 
people who have the oratory skilld to bring the broad masses of 
the people to the side of the party quickly, who communicate, 
and who have gained special [public] exposure. 
  III. Kazakhstan People's Congress 
  The Kazakhstan People's Congress Party, which thinks of 
itself as a centrist, liberal-democratic party, is, more or 
less, the most active party among all the other political 
parties at present. It has taken upon itself the role of 
opposition and of criticism of the government. We know that its 
goals are the establishment of a democratic society and a 
unitary state based on law. 
  The Kazakhstan People's Congress thinks of itself as a 
narcissistic party of the elder intelligentsia. For that reason 
its platform is directed at the creative intellectual community 
and professional groups. Due to the reputation of the party's 
leader, Olzhas Suleymenov, and the party's newspaper NARODNYY 
KONGRESS (very high quality, published in the Kazakh and Russian 
languages), its influence has been increased considerably. 
  According to the ideas of the leaders of the party, the 
party 
now has nearly 30,000 members. In addition to this, those 
controlling the "Nevada-Semey" Movement carry out the orders of 
the party exactly. 
  The Kazakhstan People's Congress Party also has many 
problems. The largest problem is how to keep in the party 
Komsomolist and national groups, once the second largest part of 
the party's membership, after the departure from its ranks of 
those supporting Mukhtar Shakhanov. Within party ranks there 
have been, sometimes quite openly, continual squabbles about 
questions of party tactics and strategy, regarding questions on 
confederation with Russia, and methods of administration of the 
party apparatus. 
  However, the group in control of the party is aware of its 
deficiencies. There was very open discussion of this in the 
Kazakhstan People's Congress Party Plenum which took place this 
year at the beginning of October. There was discussion about the 
weakness of the party's administration, the slack connection 
between the party administration and the oblast organizations of 
the party, and the need to draw women and young people broadly 
into the party... 
  It is well known that the "round table" of political 
movements was organized under the leadership of the Kazakhstan 
People's Congress Party. For that meeting the party organ strove 
to carry out the role of conciliator and of advisor. It was 
observed that it was not unpleasant for the Kazakhstan People's 
Congress Party to play that leading role. Thus, the party strove 
to exercise its influence. However such efforts will not always 
be lucky. This is because it is a fact that each of the parties 
participating in the "round table" has its own narrow interests. 
  Then the party has overcome the deficiencies obvious to its 
own eyes, when it has been able to mobilize its own members to 
obligatory hard labor, when it has discovered how to place the 
interests of society above the greed of individuals, it is 
possible that the Kazakhstan People's Congress Party will 
achieve considerable power, and will become the No. 2 party. 
  The party has powerful leaders, and there are quite a number 
of party stalwarts well known to the people. A research center 
with its own special character is operating and is capable of 
playing an important role in the formation of party strategy and 
tactics. However, the work of the party apparatus is 
insufficiently experienced. 
  Bearing in mind the great role played by party leader Olzhas 
Suleymenov in the party, it would be proper to discuss him 
separately. In addition, just now various things are being said 
about him. 
  It is difficult to find anyone who doubts that Olzhas 
Suleymenov has made a major contribution to Kazakh culture. 
However, when we come to his political work, opinions are at 
odds with one another. Some people think of him as a pure 
prophet who has set forth the single correct path leading his 
people to happiness. Others believe that he has sold out 
national interests to save his own hide. It is not easy here to 
make clear which view is the correct one. This is because the 
issue is not only in terms of the political meaning of these 
questions, but also in terms of their psychological meaning. 
Olzhas Suleymenov, thanks to his powerful gifts, has gotten used 
to being measured by all-Union standards and Kazakhstan is too 
small an arena for him. For that reason he needs the expanses of 
Eurasia. In this regard his desire is right for himself. Each 
must find his own way. God forbid, but, if our culture remains 
in isolation, those making the laws in the area of cultural 
tradition will be a monotonous color of gray, and will be feeble 
spirits compelling and casting down all things which do not 
accord with their narrow interests. The sun of Kazakh culture 
will sink. However, looked at from another perspective, it is 
well known that contemporary authors such as Thomas Mann, 
Bernard Shaw, (and I have not forgotten than ethnically he was 
Irish), Albert Camus, William Golding, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, 
Julio Cortazar, and others raised themselves from a purely 
ethnic basis to a world orbit. For that reason political 
boundaries must set no barriers to the free exchange of culture. 
  In any case, we cannot exonerate most of the opponents of O. 
Suleymenov. They have even gone so far as to use very crude 
vocabulary. However, Suleymenov does not lag behind them in this 
regard. That is to say, he paints all of those he does not agree 
with in uniform black. Did he not say: "To be sure there are 
among them (his opponents, the author) some honorable men. True 
patriots are encountered, but are they all, every one of them, 
stupid?" This weakens his argument completely. 
  The lack of amiability under just such circumstances is a 
scrooge sinking into our social soul, and is a restraint for 
democracy, and a huge, well-established barrier along the road 
to our desired happiness. 
<H5>  [27 Oct p 2] </H5>
  [Text] "Azat" 
  In June of 1992 Mikhail Yesenaliyev, former leader of the 
Civil "Azat" Movement, made a considerable effort to turn the 
various currents of the national-democratic movement into a 
single, common channel, and to unify them into a single huge 
force. However, nothing came from his efforts. Moreover, at the 
time that M. Yesenaliyev realized that his suggestion and effort 
were not going to be supported, he gave up hope of being able to 
mobilize the potentialities of this movement, and he gradually 
laid down foundations separate from the movement. This was a 
categoric, resolute, and principled step. With the departure of 
M. Yesenaliyev, internal arguments, disputes, and slander openly 
gained ground within the nationalist camp. 
  However, during October of the same year, after the 
departure 
of M. Yesenaliyev, somehow the Civil "Azat" Movement, the 
Kazakhstan Republican Party, and the Kazakhstan 
National-Democratic "Zheltoqsan" Party were successful in their 
effort to achieve unity. However, the effort has not 
accomplished anything. There are a number of reasons for this. 
In fact, there was a lack of unanimity in strategy and tactics 
for action and in the means for carrying on a political 
struggle. Views on state structure, democracy, and internal 
party democracy were varied. This by and large happened in 
connection with the individual self-interests of the chiefs of 
each of the parties. 
  After this congress called for unity, the young leaders made 
Kamal Ormantay chairman of the United "Azat" Party in place of 
the candidature of S. Aqatay, chairman of the Kazakhstan 
Republic Party. They got excited and blamed Aqatay for trying to 
cast the blame on them for the self-interest of the aims 
advanced. S. Aqatay, who was unable to gain election to the 
united party administration, was forced to walk out of the 
congress. Shortly after that he called his own congress. At 
present he has announced that only the decisions of this 
congress have legal force. At the same time, as often happens in 
politics, he was unable to attain his initial goals. Two years 
have now passed since then and "Azat," as of October of this 
year, is divided into three parts: the Kazakhstan Civil "Azat" 
Movement, the People's Democratic Party, and the Kazakhstan 
Republican Party, headed separately by Khasen Qozha-Akmet, Kamal 
Ormantay, and by Sabetqazy Aqatay. Looking at the present 
situation, there is nothing that will put a halt to their 
bickering. It is difficult to foresee in advance how it will end. 
  The group has its own newspaper called AZAT. All in all, the 
paper carries out its own independent politics. However, it 
cannot be hidden that it is in sympathy with the young leaders. 
There is no doubt that they argue with one another and that 
there is a principled disagreement which they will not be able 
to reconcile. At the same time, it is also not difficult to 
understand that behind their heated words lie their individual 
self-interests. 
  All in all, the national democratic movement wishes to 
criticize the policies being carried out by the Nazarbayev 
government in many areas including giving up nuclear weapons, 
its cadre policy, government policy towards Russia (in this case 
they are showing no sympathy for the idea suggested by Olzhas 
Suleymenov of confederation with Russia), allowing the living 
standards of the Kazakhs to decline, allowing the state of the 
Kazakh language to remain in an inadequate state up to the 
present. However, at present there is still no tested body of 
socio-economic-political policies offered by the movement 
capable of getting Kazakhstan out of its present crisis. 
  If the "Azat" national-democratic movement, having overcome 
its internal conflicts, finds a powerful leader capable of 
putting every thing together, and if they draw up a unified, 
tried and true platform, and if they renew the slogans which are 
the order of the day, and if they are able to draw intellectuals 
over to their side, it would then be possible for them to 
achieve considerable success. 
  Structures Which May Turn Into Parties 
  We have investigated the possibilities of only the very 
large 
parties and movements. However, whatever the state of these 
other political structures, it is uncertain, given present 
conditions, that they will be able to compete with the parties 
mentioned above. It is possible that in this area only the labor 
movement is special in any way. In truth there are many parties, 
but they have no real potentiality. 
  It would be no surprise if a "Slavic Party" were to emerge 
through combining the interethnic "Yedinstvo" Movement, the 
"Lad" Slavic Movement, and separatist movements in the north and 
east of the Republic. If this were to happen such a party would 
have considerable political power, and there would be the need 
to take it into consideration. 
  There is not a little talk about the possibility of 
professional groups forming a party. 
  As the election campaign gets nearer, it is well known that 
political activity will strengthen, that each party will examine 
more or less completely its specific possibilities, and that all 
will endeavor to take whatever actions they need to strengthen 
their ranks. A confused struggle will be waged openly by the 
parties to draw over to their side figures with strong 
organizational powers, orators, the communicators, talented 
crafters of words, and activist citizens who are widely known. 
Under such conditions, the success of a party will depend upon 
many factors. As we have noted, factors such as the capacity of 
the party command to act in complete unity, the resourcefulness 
of party leaders, finances, access to the mass media, above all 
the television channels, the ability to select good candidates 
for parliament, a good election platform, the power to influence 
in all regions, proper determination of the real point of view 
of the president and the psychological state of the electorate, 
and, based upon this, the ability of party propaganda to strike 
the right note play a very great role. 
  At present it is difficult to foresee what parties will gain 
seats in the new parliament. A great deal is connected with the 
conditions under which the elections will take place, what kind 
of election laws there will be, and how the law is observed. In 
this connection, it is altogether possible that the elections 
will be carried out ahead of schedule in connection with certain 
tactical circumstances. One thing is very clear: if the 
elections are carried out according to a proportional 
[representation] system, the paucity of parties will find its 
clear expression. Under such conditions, it would be no surprise 
if 10 percent of the body of deputies were to be comprised of 
representatives of newly rich. This is because they are making 
every intentional preparation for the impending elections. (We 
are not taking into account here those who will end up somewhere 
after the elections.) Close to 10 percent of the deputies may be 
comprised of strugglers to protect local interests, and five 
percent may be comprised of independents and of representatives 
of small parties. All of these categories will account for about 
one-fourth of all the deputies. The remaining three-fourths, 
more or less, will be divided among the four great parties. 
However, if prior to the elections parliamentary parties appear 
which are not included among the four, it is possible that the 
division might be between five parties. Without doubt the 
Kazakhstan People's Unity Union will receive the largest vote. 
However, it is doubtful if it will achieve an absolute majority. 
For that reason it will have to seek coalition partners for 
itself from the onset. A wing of the Kazakhstan People's 
Congress will be in second place, more or less, in terms of 
numbers of deputies. (If this is so, under conditions whereby 
the Kazakhstan People's Unity Union and the Kazakhstan People's 
Congress maintain their alliance, they will have an absolute 
majority). However, the Socialists, and the "Azat" people (under 
conditions whereby they continue to unify their efforts) will be 
in third and fourth place. It is possible that after the new 
elections a certain portion of the deputies will look to various 
interests. That is to say, they will be for a time members of a 
given party, but at the same time it is possible that they will 
defend regional interests or that they will develop an interest 
in some industry or even in the wealth of financial capital and 
will go over to these causes. (However, if the majority system 
for the elections undergoes considerable change in time, and the 
small parties are not able to send their representatives to 
parliament, then it may happen that the body of deputies will be 
comprised of only the four large parties). Thus, when the new 
parliament takes office, it is clear that many factions will be 
represented there. New relationships based upon principle will 
be established among them, and the power of such factions will 
depend not only upon the number of deputies elected supporting 
them, but, at the same time, upon the prestige and skill of the 
individual deputies. 
  Whether or not the task of the new parliament will be to 
form 
a Cabinet of Ministers capable of bringing our nation our of 
anarchy and the confusion of rampant crisis, only time will tell. 
  From the Editor 
  We are in a new era for the development of social thought 
and 
views in the Republic. The task assigned in this era to 
political parties and movements, to other social organizations 
and associations striving to be involved intimately in social 
life and livelihood, is a heavy one. It is clear in particular 
that the weight of the these tasks is becoming considerably 
heavier in the present time of "a narrow road and a slippery 
street," when the Kazakhstan state is wracking its brain looking 
for a way out of the pressing difficulties of a complex time and 
of the quagmire of economic crisis. 
  It is the duty of us all to shape the school constituted by 
a 
free, highly sophisticated political parliament which will 
operate on a new kind of parliamentary model. It will be the 
political parliament of a free Kazakhstan, which has raised the 
flag of independence, gained membership in the United Nations 
Organization, ratified a constitution, and joined the ranks of 
civilized nations. The methods which we have hitherto expressed, 
the very great test of our established form of government will 
produce an outcome in half a year at the time of the elections 
to the Supreme Kenges of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In whose 
hands will the reins of political leadership be in the new, 
specialized parliament? Also, what political parties will carry 
the burden of the trust of the people and its heritage, and how 
and in what ways will they be raised to the level of an honored 
foundation for tomorrow. Who will pay tomorrow's debts? And how 
will they be paid? The citizens of Kazakhstan, raised to a new 
level of social development, cannot remain apart from questions 
concerning the fate of such a nation. This is because the fate 
of our sovereign people is in the balance. In this circumstance, 
we think that the pledge which the people will give to the 
political parties, and the tasks of the times begin with today. 
  It is to be expected that this article offered to readers 
could have said too much in some places and too little in 
others. It is not easy to share the latest views on a rich 
political arena of such broad scope. Large and small events in 
the backs and forths of our history and the various difficult 
times which we have suffered show that these views are right. 
The editors have no intention of supporting any party or any 
known stalwart. Likewise, it has no intention of offending any 
party or stalwart. Our greatest goal, growing out of the 
interests of the people, is to touch briefly on the inner 
preparation and potentialities of the political forces 
exhausting us all on the eve of a projecting "national event."

  [Text] "We came with blood and we shall leave with 
blood,"--the popular saying, ascribed sometimes to Emomali 
Rakhmonov, sometimes to his first deputy Abdumadzhid Dostiyev, 
and sometimes to Minister of Internal Affairs Yakub Salimov, is 
going around Tajikistan. 
<H5>  The Will of the Imam </H5>
  "Success on the roads!" the nice-looking Lena Shmeleva 
regularly repeats in "Avtomig." The deeper meaning of this wish 
becomes clear in the cab of the ZIL on the Osh-Khorog route 
which links Kyrgyzstan to Gornyy Badakhshan. No formalities are 
needed with the Pamir drivers. The currency of independent 
Kyrgyzstan, the som, is less popular than Russian rubles and 10 
or 20 thousand of them are "taken" from the drivers. Yet life in 
the disgraced Gornyy Badakhshan is hanging by the thread of this 
high mountain route: This is the only remaining relatively 
stable channel for bringing to the autonomous republic flour and 
oil from the "Fund of Agakhan" and fuel and cement for 
construction of the Pamir-1 hydroelectric power plant. 
  The humanitarian aid of the "Fund of Agakhan" and the 
construction of the hydroelectric power plant today have become 
effective channels through which Dushanbe authorities can apply 
pressure on the Gornyy-Badakhshan autonomous region. "Unless 
Pamir-1 is started up in the winter there will be a catastrophe 
in Khorog," says the journalist G. Mamadloikov. Yet it is 
deliveries of cement and the supply of fuel that are regularly 
slowed up and cut off. 
  Relations between the Dushanbe authorities and Badakhshan 
remain deadlocked. Official Khorog has formally distanced itself 
from the armed opposition and from the orientation of Badakhshan 
self-defense commanders, restricting itself to defense of only 
their own territory, without intervening in the civil war 
outside Pamir. But the sympathies of many residents of 
Badakhshan are with the opposition leaders: Kazikolon 
Turadzhonzod, Davlat, Khudonazarov, the mujahidin field 
commanders Rizvon and Dzhuma-Boy and the head of the "transition 
government in emigration" Mullah Abdullo Nuri--this is obvious. 
  Nonetheless at a recent conference between Rizvon and the 
Badakhshan commanders it was decided that the Badakhshan troops 
would concentrate only on defending their own territory. A 
significant factor affected this decision. 
  In October the deputy chairman of the Supreme Council of 
Tajikistan, Kazidavlat Koimdodov, met in Geneva with Karim Shakh 
al-Khuseyn and Imam Agakhan IV--the spiritual head of the Muslim 
Ismailites who constitute almost all of the population of Pamir. 
For several days Koimdodov travelled through the Badakhshan 
villages speaking about the meeting with the Imam and he 
repeated many times the Agakhan's demand to refrain from 
participation in the Tajik civil war. If this demand is not 
complied with, the Imam will stop the humanitarian aid. 
  Agakhan is the unassailable authority for every Ismailite. 
Moreover, the humanitarian aid from the Fund of Agakhan is the 
only thing making it possible today for the population of 
200,000 in Pamir to exist. The Imam's demand is the law, even if 
it is conveyed by the deputy of Emomali Rakhmonov. 
<H5>  Who Is Defending Whom? </H5>
  Respect for the Imam is perhaps the only thing that unites 
Badakhshan society today. 
  The civilian activists of Khorog, self-defense troops, and 
politicized refugees are consolidated around the executive 
committee of the oblast council headed by its chairman, 
Balkhiyer Zamirov. They are oriented toward expansion of the 
independence of Badakhshan, strengthening of its civic 
structures, and economic and administrative reforms. 
  In a large region--Verkhniy Khorog--the influence of the 
Communist Party is traditionally strong. Here they are aspiring 
to reconciliation with Dushanbe and blame all of Pamir's 
problems on the opposition and local commandos. The mouthpiece 
of this tendency is the presidium of the oblast council headed 
by Gambsho Shakhbozov. 
  The main political objective of the reformists is for 
Badakhshan to achieve the status of an autonomous republic. It 
has already been conferred without preliminary permission and 
has been recognized by the Tajik opposition. The Dushanbe 
government, avoiding a categorical refusal, is insisting on 
"postponing a decision on the problem until the situation 
stabilizes." 
  Naturally, the political antagonism only aggravates the 
social problems. The fellow traveler of the blockade--the total 
deficit--is turning into impoverishment, black market 
speculation, and unrestrained mafia activity. Not every family 
has a garden and a ram, and the average wage of 10,000-15,000 
rubles [R], paid as if by force, does not enable everyone to 
take advantage of the services of merchants who produce food, 
clothing, and consumer goods from Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan. 
Strikes are developing among workers of budget-financed 
organizations. "With this kind of poverty it is impossible to 
put an end to contraband drugs," states the former minister of 
foreign affairs of Tajikistan, General M. Navzhuvanov. 
  Recently the fight against drug trafficking has been the 
main 
task of the Khorog border detachment. Officers of Russian border 
troops candidly admit that without help from Badakhshan 
self-defense forces, not only is it impossible to hope to close 
off the border, but one cannot even speak about elementary 
safety of the border guards. There have been no victims in the 
four seizures of hostages in recent months only because of 
intervention from the Badakhshan commanders, who each time went 
to the negotiations with their Afghan "colleagues" and achieved 
the release of the Russian military men. 
  "It is not they who are protecting us but we are protecting 
them," said a Badakhshan commando. "But Kozyrev and Grachev keep 
this in mind in Moscow when they are helping Rakhmonov." The 
border guards did not respond. 
<H5>  Tug of War </H5>
  The Kulyab nomenklatura-mafia clan, which won in the civil 
war in 1992, has extracted everything it could from the victory. 
Its representatives control all key posts in the organs of 
power. The Tajik army and other power structures are under its 
jurisdiction. It still has reliable military support--the 
Russian 201st Division. But still the path back has been cut off 
for it as has any possibility of compromise--the military crimes 
of the army of Sangak Safarov, in whose ranks practically all 
the "Kulyab leaders" fought, were too great. 
  The Leninabad nomenklatura, whose 55-year rule was shaken by 
the May victory of the Democratic Islam opposition in 1992, 
recognized its mistake. The bureaucratic business of 
Leninabad-Khudzhand financed the organization and arming of the 
Sangak People's Front but the administrators and bosses of the 
Communist Party of Tajikistan (KPT) were crowded out of power by 
the Kulyab commando leaders. In order to protect themselves from 
armed attacks, residents of Leninabad even had to blow up the 
bridge that joins the oblast to the rest of Tajikistan and think 
seriously about becoming autonomous themselves--this is the soil 
on which the accelerated rapprochement between the Khudzhan and 
Khorog leaders appeared. 
  In this arrangement it is instructive to look at the 
position 
of the Leninabad boss Sasafaral Kendzhayev, former chairman of 
the republic's Supreme Council, around whom the "Tajik knot" was 
tied in the spring of '92. An active participant in the war who 
in October '92 made a bloody attempt to seize Dushanbe, and an 
experienced political intriguer, after the "victory" Kendzhayev 
was pushed into the background by competitors from Kulyab. Left 
as merely the rayon procurator, he quickly went over to the 
opposition, retaining and reinforcing his own armed guard made 
up of ethnic Uzbeks from Gissar and began to cautiously explore 
the possibilities of joint actions...with the Democratic Islam 
opposition! He formulated a package of demands on the government 
clearly intended to support the opposition, especially those 
from Pamir: the resignation of all Kulyab leaders (true, 
Rakhmonov was a possible exception), redistribution among the 
regions of posts in the power structures, return to the refugees 
of real estate and other property seized from them, etc. 
  A solid foundation for the "Leninabad revenge" is being 
prepared by the slowly but confidently unfolding processes of 
nomenklatura privatization: The monopolistic monolith of state 
industry remains unshakable and the distributors of state 
property, pumping funds into commercial structures, are opening 
light productions and trade enterprises. The interests of the 
nomenklatura bourgeoisie of a "Deng Xiaoping" bent are 
objectively coming into conflict with the "kimirsenov" solidity 
of the Kulyab commandos. 
  On the other hand, the position of the ruling regime is made 
burdensome by the ideology of the KPT, which actually 
contradicts the interests of the Dushanbe elite. The KPT is a 
part of the SKP [United Communist Party]-CPSU, and the 
restoration of the USSR is the cornerstone of its program. This 
is not very inspiring to the heads of the regime who think that 
they are assured patronage from Tashkent and Moscow. On the soil 
of this contradiction arose the People's Party (NPT) headed by 
the first deputy chairman of the Supreme Council, A. Dostiyev, 
who is assigned the role of supporting the regime (like the 
Democratic Party of Turkmenistan under President S. Niyazov) and 
at the same time--acting as a weapon for Dostiyev in his 
struggle for power. 
  As long as the tug of war is going on, the threat of the 
collapse of Tajikistan becomes more and more real. Expansion of 
the independence of Badakhshan can no longer be stopped even 
with force. Leninabad-Khudzhand, which is rich and closely 
linked to Tashkent, is quite capable of autonomy. Gissarskiy 
Rayon with its significant Uzbek population has long been drawn 
to Uzbekistan. Khatlon (a combination of Kulyab and Kurgan-Tyube 
Oblast) and the Garm group of rayons, where the influence of 
Islamic political forces is strong, are tied up in a war with 
one another which could ultimately compare to the land of 
Dushanbe... But, "we came with blood...." 
<H5>  Party Committees and Mosques </H5>
  They understand all this in Badakhshan. They were clearly 
sympathetic to the appointment of Rizvon as minister of defense 
in the "transition government" of Abdullo Nuri. The line of the 
Kazikolon Turadzhonzod, which presupposes a political resolution 
to the conflict, is losing influence. Proponents of maximum 
consolidation of armed opposition and overthrow of the current 
Dushanbe regime by force are coming to the fore. 
  "I personally think negotiations and a peaceful regulation 
are impossible," says Khadzhi Badakhshi, one of the military 
leaders of the opposition and coordinator of the Badakhshan 
mujahidin. "The current power must be unconditionally 
overthrown, and this will be done by the armed forces of the 
mujahidin who are supported by the Tajik people. Russian troops 
must be expelled from Tajikistan. This pertains both to the 
201st Division and to the border guards. Our armed forces are 
quite capable of controlling their border themselves." 
  "Among the mujahidin they are speaking more and more 
frequently about a jihad. Does this mean dissemination of the 
ideology of Islamic fundamentalism?" 
  "No," Khadzhi answers resolutely. "A jihad today is not a 
war 
for Islam but an anticommunist liberation war. The war is also 
revenge against the murderers." 
  Khadzhi Badakhshi emphasized that what he said is his own 
personal viewpoint. The "transition government" is still just 
developing its final position. But it very much seems that it 
will finally be formed in precisely these configurations. 
  How is Russia to figure out its role and its interests in 
view of this quite real prospect? Russia ends up in the role of 
a helpless observer in the face of Afghan internal conflicts 
which affect its vital interests. Forcing General Dustum, a 
creature of the Uzbek neocommunist regime, from the scene, the 
fundamentalist Golboddin Hekmatyar and the moderate Islamist 
Ahmad Shah Masood, a more "Europeanized" figure and one who is 
oriented toward Islamic modernism, came together. The weakening 
of Dustum's position is objectively advantageous to 
Russia--which cannot be said, however, about the strengthening 
of Hekmatyar. The "contact" with Masood, the official minister 
of defense of the IGA [Islamic State of Afghanistan], who is 
popular in both Afghanistan and Tajikistan, "through the head" 
of the Hekmatyar leadership would help to stabilize Russian 
interests not only in Afghanistan itself but also with respect 
to the Tajik war. 
  In the second place, the matter is actually proceeding to a 
point where Tajikistan, Russia's potential stronghold in Central 
Asia, is gradually entering the zone of Islamization. Pro-Islam 
sentiments are growing in Uzbekistan, especially in its southern 
regions (Fergana, Namangan). It cannot be ruled out that the 
sinking dictatorship will try to play the card of Islamization 
in Tajikistan next. 
  "Everything is ready in Leninabad," said B. Zamirov in 
Khorog. "The union of party committees and mosques is becoming 
stronger there. They are just waiting for a signal. After all, 
portraits of Marx, Lenin, and Najibollah hung in Afghanistan 
too--and nobody even noticed when they were replaced with green 
flags." 
  It is difficult to argue with this.

Uzbek Footprint in Afghanistan. Islam Karimov Aspires to the 
Role of Leonid Brezhnev, Apparently, in the Affairs of Our 
Southern Neighbor"] 
  [Text] For 10 long years, the word "Afghanistan" was 
ever present in the newspapers. Journalists of the Lenin school 
would adduce it with well-paid pride; ordinary people would 
utter it with condemnation or hatred. 
  Time has passed, and the Amudarya was left astern of 
the last Soviet tank, and Afghanistan remains merely in the 
nostalgic songs of burned and legless poets. It has once again 
become as alien and remote as prior to 1979, when the 
semi-idiotic slack-jawed old man called on us from the 
television screen to fulfill our "international duty." 
  But those who think that peace and prosperity have come 
to reign in Afghanistan following our departure are wrong. Not 
always is fighting followed by peace, and it happens that one 
war is replaced by another--as has been the case in Afghanistan 
also. Jihad--"holy war against the infidel"--has come to be 
replaced by civil war--a war of all against all. The 
"international duty" in whose name Afghanistan was in flames for 
a whole decade dragged out into the open all the conflicts that 
had built up over centuries in Afghan society, inundated 
it--illiterate and backward--with piles of weapons, and made it 
ungovernable. And after the Soviet departure, the fire of war 
not only did not die out, but flared up with even greater force. 
  According to eyewitnesses, the devastation of recent 
years has surpassed many times over what was done with our 
"assistance": Kabul, for example, has already simply died; it 
does not exist. And considering that it is around this latter 
that the main struggle is being conducted, it may be assumed 
that there will shortly be nothing left to fight over. This 
might seem improbable and blasphemous, but many people in 
Afghanistan remember with nostalgia the days when the "shuravi" 
[Russians] were there--in just the same way that the most 
inveterate democrats in Russia are beginning increasingly with a 
wistful sigh to recall stagnation. The reason is the same: 
"There was at least some order then. Now...." 
  But, as reality shows, it is still somewhat early to 
forget conclusively about Afghanistan. The Afghan knot not only 
has not been completely untied; it has in places--primarily on 
the southern flanks of the former USSR--been pulled even 
tighter. We have tried to pull out one of the threads of this 
knot. 
  I would like to call the reader's attention to the fact 
that none of what is discussed below is the fruit of the 
imagination of NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA journalists. We 
obtained the information that we are making public via two 
channels, perfectly reliable, not connected with one another, 
and sufficiently authenticated, of the former KGB (we will not 
specify the subdivision) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Russia. We set forth the viewpoint of these specialists, who, 
for understandable reasons, wished to remain incognito. 
  Were someone to try to make a national-ethnic map of 
Afghanistan, he would, most likely, get something akin to a 
patchwork quilt: dozens of tribes and national groups, related, 
for the most part, to our Central Asian groups, and dozens of 
independent enclaves, where local "authorities"--of varying 
caliber, but united by a single aspiration--never to submit to 
anyone ever--rule. It was precisely the inveterate 
national-ethnic conflicts--primarily between the Pashtuns, 
Tajiks, Uzbeks, and Hazara--that were the basis of the 
antagonism that erupted in Afghanistan following the withdrawal 
of the Soviet forces. 
  As we all know, the principal "heroes" of this protracted 
armed confrontation have from the outset been the Tajik Rabbani, 
the present president of Afghanistan, and the Pashtun Gulbuddin 
Hikmatyar, who in the years of the Soviet presence were, 
perhaps, the main figures in the Afghan resistance. But others 
besides them have been participating in this game also. 
Specifically, Gen. Rashid Dostum, whose name surfaced in our 
press only recently in connection with the combat operations 
that he mounted in Kabul at the start of January. In the game of 
chess that we wish to investigate, this figure is, perhaps, of 
greater significance than his distinguished competitors, and we 
will dwell on him, therefore. 
  Gen. Rashid Dostum is, in his way, a unique personality. 
Primarily because there have been practically no Uzbek generals 
in Afghanistan. Uzbeks never fought here, being one of the most 
peaceful groups of the population. But in the final years of the 
war, an Uzbek volunteer force, which was headed by Dostum and on 
which, however odd, Kabul officialdom--Pashtun--came to rely, 
emerged. The Uzbek militia took part increasingly often in the 
armed struggle against the mojahedin and subsequently was the 
main lever that....removed Najibullah himself. 
  Subsequently, Dostum became the uncrowned king of all the 
enclaves of Afghanistan populated by Uzbeks, this being several 
northern provinces of the country bordering Uzbekistan and, 
partially, Tajikistan. Having seized power in the north, he 
concentrated in his hands a very strong military grouping. He 
succeeded in uniting under his command colossal 
forces--practically all the government formations located in 
this region--with a large quantity of hardware, up to and 
including aircraft and tanks. In addition, the main weapons 
stores from the time when arms had been transferred from the 
territory of the USSR were based in the north. And, finally, the 
Afghan North means, in addition, the most economically developed 
zone of the country, where gas is recovered and mineral 
fertilizer is produced, and where the Afghan granary is located. 
And Dostum was able to bring all this under his control. 
  It is for this reason, most likely, that the antagonistic 
groupings of Rabbani and Hikmatyar conducted a constant struggle 
for him, attempting to win the general over to their side. And 
at the same time, on the other hand, they were unwilling to 
recognize him as an independent political force and equal 
participant in the political process or let him into Kabul. The 
Pashtuns and Tajiks continued to keep the Uzbeks at the 
doorstep. This is, generally, typical of the politics of any 
country: No one wants to admit to the game a new player, to 
acknowledge for him the same rights even less. It was made known 
to Dostum, as it were: You are a powerful and robust fellow, 
just stay up there in the north and do not butt in here. But he 
wanted more. And this grievance is a reason why General Dostum's 
artillery has begun to speak in Kabul as of late. 
  The processes occurring in Afghanistan, particularly in the 
north, long since ceased to be exclusively Afghan. The extensive 
involvement of Tajikistan here is obvious and not in question. 
But a tremendous place is occupied here also by Uzbek interests, 
which is, in fact, the main subject of this article. 
  According to our source from the Russian special services, 
Islam Karimov and his circle almost immediately began to regard 
the northern zone of Afghanistan, which is populated by ethnic 
Uzbeks, as their own patrimony. Not as a piece of Uzbekistan, of 
course, but, at least, as a zone that lies in the sphere of 
their "vital interests." "Tashkent," he said, "immediately 
gambled on Dostum and has in the past 18 months to two years 
turned him, essentially, into Karimov's puppet. This is written 
about extremely infrequently even in intelligence material--it 
is too delicate a subject." 
  Uzbekistan has picked up with enthusiasm the relay baton 
dropped by the Soviet Union and is attempting to do everything 
to take its place--in the region of interest to it, at least. 
Remember the rail bridge across the Amudarya, on one side of 
which is Uzbek Termez, on the other, the Afghan Khayraton, the 
headquarters of General Dostum. Earlier the Soviet Union fed 
almost all of Afghanistan via this artery; now it is being used 
by the Uzbeks. It is just that the freight traveling along it is 
intended exclusively for General Dostum. This fact is not 
paraded anywhere, we were told in confidence in the Foreign 
Ministry. This is being done in concealed and clandestine 
manner--so clandestinely that it is assumed that even the 
Russian General Consulate is unaware of this. 
  What is actually crossing the Uzbek-Afghan border? Weapons, 
primarily. According to our contact in intelligence, Tashkent is 
providing fully for Dostum's small arms and ammunition 
requirements, driving armored equipment across the border.... 
Not, of course, on the scale and in the flow as was formerly the 
case from the Soviet Union, but it is more than enough for the 
northerners. In addition, aside from the weapons, Dostum is 
receiving from Uzbekistan wheat, sugar, petroleum 
products--everything without which he could not exist. This is 
partially being done on a noncompensable basis, partially--as 
far as the weapons are concerned--for hard currency. The Uzbeks 
take dollars from their ethnic brothers with pleasure--and the 
flow of weapons into Afghanistan is constant. 
  Uzbekistan's positions in the camp of General Dostum today 
are very reminiscent of those that the Soviet Union once had in 
Kabul. Dostum is surrounded by Uzbek advisers, and constant 
contact is maintained at the top political leadership level and 
at the special services level. The Uzbek consul general is the 
No. 2 after Dostum himself, and he is the point of contact for 
the general's whole entourage. That is, there is total apical 
adhesion. On top of everything else, it is based on Tashkent's 
continuous direct bribery of Dostum and his circle. If just a 
year ago, even, some general of Dostum's drove around in a 
Volga, he was considered somebody. There are now in Dostum's 
retinue approximately 150 brand-new Rajero jeeps. Or, for 
example, Dostum drives to a meeting with an Uzbek leader 
somewhere closer to the border. Uzbek combat helicopters fly 
here--"to guard Comrade Dostum".... 
  According to our contacts in the Foreign Ministry and 
intelligence, their colleagues coming from Afghanistan tell of 
literally incredible things--incredible from the viewpoint of 
any normal state. An Uzbek Government delegation goes to 
Mazar-e-Sharif to meet with General Dostum, say. It does not 
inquire about visas, does not register the border 
crossing--nothing! Helicopters simply fly in and set down, as if 
at home. And unless Kabul officials are given a "knock on the 
door" in time, they do not even find out about this--no one asks 
them about or tells them anything. Yet we are talking about the 
arrival of an official delegation at the ministerial and deputy 
ministerial level! What is this--de facto recognition of the 
existence of some virtually independent Uzbek state on the 
territory of Afghanistan? 
  Whatever authorities are in place in Kabul, and however they 
are torn apart among themselves, it has been difficult for them, 
of course, to put up with such humiliation. This is why they 
have been attempting to lay hold of Dostum. For six months, 
longer, perhaps, Rabbani and his circle have been attempting to 
besiege Dostum if only somewhat and put him in his place. He was 
"rapped on the knuckles" when he attempted to expand the sphere 
of his influence and has sometimes even been forced out of the 
zones that he has traditionally controlled. Thus as a result of 
one such action, on 14 November Dostum lost his base of Sherkhan 
on the border with Tajikistan. "Speaking in confidence," a 
well-informed employee of Russia's Foreign Ministry notified us, 
"the Uzbeks even started to complain to us about this: Comrade 
Dostum--our supporter--they say, who is defending Russia's 
interests as well, is being squeezed by the damn Islamists. 
Earnestly trying to persuade us that Dostum is a conduit of our 
interests and a defender of the borders, they asked us to give 
him weapons (and he wanted a great many). But this trick did not 
work, fortunately. And 'damn Islamists' had absolutely nothing 
to do with it--it was an exclusively Afghan showdown: Kabul was 
putting the squeeze on the Uzbeks, who, from its viewpoint, had 
somewhat overstepped the mark." 
  NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA experts were unanimous in 
surmising that the position of Dostum, autonomous and hostile 
toward all, has been programmed and continues to be programmed, 
by all accounts, by Karimov. After all, he who pays the piper 
calls the tune. Were it not for the powerful Uzbek influence, 
Dostum would, most likely, be behaving somewhat differently, and 
his relations with the central authorities would be organized 
more flexibly, at least. But under the pressure of the Uzbeks 
and relying constantly on their assistance, he has been able to 
permit himself such a line of behavior. 
  What has happened today? There are two versions in this 
connection, and they are not mutually exclusive, what is more. 
  First version. The aggrieved, dissatisfied general simply 
decided to bare his teeth. And he had teeth: Dostum's armed 
formations were in Kabul, even, controlling several important 
points. 
  The second version is that it is Tashkent, possibly, which 
pushed Dostum into this war. Karimov is very unhappy at all the 
recent events--the results of Rabbani's visit to Dushanbe and 
the signs of fraternization of the Tajiks--ours and their Afghan 
counterparts--that have emerged. And so he decided via his 
protege to emphasize his interests, without, possibly, looking 
for anything in particular, what is more. "I believe," the 
intelligence expert told us, "that Karimov is sufficiently smart 
and understands that Dostum is not in a position to aspire to a 
seizure of power in Kabul, even technically. But this way he 
could make his presence felt. The Afghan Uzbeks are very simple 
people, and pushing them and inciting them to some serious 
actions is not difficult, therefore. So I do not rule out there 
having been direct pressure, direct prompting from Tashkent, 
here. Any assistance, any support was promised, and Dostum was 
told: Do as much as you can; they are victimizing you and 
hitting you on both cheeks.... You need to show them. Come on, 
boy, let us go into action." This is conjecture, of course, but 
it may be considered correct, because it is difficult to find a 
logical explanation for this entire business otherwise. 
  One further factor that has to be taken into account when 
analyzing this mixed-up game of solitaire is the mutual 
relations and intermingling of interests of Tashkent and 
Dushanbe. As the Foreign Ministry specialist believes, Tashkent 
would not want to see the failure of the present Tajik regime, 
but nor at the same time is it interested in national 
reconciliation in Tajikistan. It is Karimov, by all accounts, 
who is pushing President Rakhimov toward the most radical, 
extreme position in the struggle against his adversaries. In 
analysts' opinion, he would like a solution of the Tajik problem 
on his, Uzbek terms, even hoping, perhaps, for the 
disintegration of Tajikistan and the annexation of some Tajik 
territories--disputed oblasts with mixed population--to 
Uzbekistan. 
  On the other hand, Tajikistan cannot today be regarded as a 
serious rival in the Afghan game. Essentially, Tajikistan itself 
barely still exists in practice: There is no authority, the 
government is incredibly weak, the economy is not working, 
levers of administration are lacking, and there are no effective 
special services or armed forces. Tajikistan is not currently a 
working proposition. It is for this reason fully dependent on 
Russia, and Karimov is constantly reproaching the president of 
Tajikistan for this dependence, incidentally, failing to 
understand that the latter simply cannot act otherwise. 
  Uzbekistan itself is already pursuing its own national 
policy, exaggeratedly national, what is more. It is literally 
supplanting Russia on the southern flanks, saying, as it were: 
This is our border, this is our zone of responsibility, these 
are our interests, there is nothing for you to do here. The same 
thing is constantly being drilled into the Afghans, Dostum 
included. 
  This entire situation prompts very serious reflection. 
Several years ago, when the fratricidal Afghan strife erupted, 
many people got a headache: Now, they said, Islamic 
fundamentalism will spill across the border and flow over Soviet 
territory, engulfing our republics. Life turned out differently. 
Now, it would seem, the Central Asian republics of the former 
USSR could be a center of problems. It is from there that the 
blast waves of hard-core nationalism and separatism will come. 
And this is being manifested today even in the game that is 
being played around Afghanistan: The events occurring there are 
dictated to a tremendous extent by the Central Asia factor. 
  The creation and formation of Central Asian states could 
prove more frightening than Islamic fundamentalism. They are 
artificial and never existed on the map within their present 
borders, in their present form, in their present shapes. Within 
the framework of the Soviet Union, they were not normal, 
full-fledged states either: Tied by an umbilical cord to Moscow, 
they were nursed and fed from there and controlled from there. 
And now a process of their national-state formation, which 
simply cannot be painless, is under way. It will certainly be 
fraught with incredible excesses, which we can partially see 
today, even. 
  It is perfectly possible that unless other powers, Russia 
included, succeed in bringing this process under some prudent 
control, we will acquire an immense zone of regional crisis 
called Central Asia--a long and painful crisis that could bring 
about a total recarving of the borders and colossal human and 
other casualties. This would be a Transcaucasus squared. Signs 
of this gathering storm are in evidence. Will it be averted? 
  This will depend on many things, on Russia included. 
  In the opinion of Foreign Ministry experts, Russia's eastern 
policy needs, generally, to be devised from scratch, because the 
old one has failed, and there is no new one as yet. Nor, 
furthermore, should it be as rectilinear as yesterday or as 
amorphous as today. The political course in respect to this 
region should be as flexible, subtle, and multifaceted as 
possible. Especially since no one in Afghanistan any longer 
views Russia as an enemy, and all, including the most odious 
personalities, are prepared to cooperate with it today.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin </F>
by ARGUMENTY I FAKTY correspondents Natalya Zhelnorova and 
Aleksandr Meshcherskiy; date not given: "V. Chernomyrdin: `The 
Government Is Not an Experimental Club'"] 
  [Text] Our special correspondents Natalya Zhelnorova 
and Aleksandr Meshcherskiy met with the Russian prime minister 
at the economic summit in Davos (Switzerland). 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] When you joined the government in 1991, 
did you entertain the thought that not only would you survive in 
it (the atmosphere surrounding your name at the time was heavy), 
but would actually become the head of the government? It appears 
that the president has entrusted to you completely this ship 
named "Russia," and now its fate, the fate of reform, is in your 
hands. 
  [Chernomyrdin] This happened so quickly, so unexpectedly... 
I 
never thought this would happen. Moreover--I did not strive for 
it, did not want to. Seeing, however, what was happening in the 
government, I felt hurt, and I knew that with my expertise, 
professional training, and considerable experience I would not 
do any worse. The government is not a club; it was hard for me 
to watch experimentation here, knowing that each decision of 
ours affects the fate of millions of people. So when I was told 
I was needed, I decided to give it my best shot. 
  Of course, a lot depends on who you work with. I emphasize 
that I do not see this government as perfect. But it is not easy 
to find qualified people. To some you say: Come work with us, 
but they do not because they are already doing something they 
like. I cannot go around yelling everywhere that I need 
ministers. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] But there are also people who very much 
want to be in the government! 
  [Chernomyrdin] That is the kind of people I do not want! I 
do 
not know which they want more: work or power. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] There have been rumors that you and 
Zaveryukha come from the same parts, and that is why you shield 
him from criticism and support him with credit. 
  [Chernomyrdin] I did not know Zaveryukha before. He 
"surfaced" later. We were looking for a minister and had gone 
through many candidates when he was recommended to me. We never 
met until then. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Rumor No. 2: Abalkin and Petrakov are 
writing an economic program for you. 
  [Chernomyrdin] By the way, Petrakov was the first 
market-oriented economist in our country. How can I speak badly 
of him? As well as Abalkin. As for the rumors--I have not 
commissioned any programs, and if people write them, good. We 
should not let market pioneers be left out of the mainstream. 
This is not fair. On the contrary, I tell all intelligent 
people: Give us programs and proposals, and we will discuss them. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Why do you not hire women to the 
government? In terms of conscientiousness, smarts, and economic 
wit they have no equal among men. The leadership can move 
mountains with their help! 
  [Chernomyrdin] I agree. This is not the best of our 
traditions--that we do not utilize in the government their 
discipline, honesty, and ability to work hard. Why it has come 
to be this way, I am at a loss to answer. Apparently, it is 
because we are picked out, and then we find others--we all come 
from the same "pot." We know and see who can work and how. I am 
not against women in the government, but they need to be 
noticed, so to speak, manifest themselves in the business. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Now that Gaydar and Fedorov have left, 
would you speak of their work with gratitude or censure? 
  [Chernomyrdin] I will tell you straight, as it really was. 
Gaydar came in September when the program already had been 
approved (6 August), and we were already implementing everything 
envisaged by it--combating inflation, and other tough measures. 
He began working and, frankly, took a lot off my shoulders by 
tending to urgent matters. His departure, however, was a 
political step, in my opinion. In his place it was not necessary 
to slam the door. This is not dignified. I think that in this 
respect he is wrong. 
  All the subterfuge surrounding his leaving and resignation 
do 
not speak well of anyone. If you want to leave (after all, 
nobody can force you to work!), do it in a normal way. People 
watch this, and draw conclusions. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Do you not select complacent people to 
work with you and let the obstinate ones go? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Were I unhappy with their work, they would be 
out of here in two minutes. On the contrary, I need obstinate 
people. I must see two sides of the problem, with everyone 
defending his point of view. Only then can you see the truth, 
the essence of the issue. If you are surrounded by yes-men, it 
is dangerous. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Do you believe that now you have put 
together a government that is ideal for implementing the reforms? 
  [Chernomyrdin] No, I do not. Forming a government is not a 
simple process. At the time I told people working with Gaydar: 
Those who do not like it may leave. But those who stay will work 
the way I demand. Any decision here is made collectively; both 
reformers and nonreformers participate, but I, the chairman, 
have the last word. Nobody can bypass me in making an important 
decision. 
  Former ministers now say at press conferences that "they 
could do anything." They like it; when people are young, a lot 
of things make their heads spin. But neither Fedorov nor anyone 
else made crucial decisions on their own. Decisions are made 
either in the presidium, or by Chernomyrdin. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Viktor Stepanovich, if you, like 
Gaydar's 
former government, do not explain your policy to the people 
(what you want, and how you are going to do it), your actions 
will be doomed to failure. You cannot implement reform without 
popular support. 
  [Chernomyrdin] I agree with you; in this respect we were 
losing; we distanced ourselves from the people. We have agreed 
now to explain to the people any government decision: What we 
plan and what came out of it. If things do not go right, we will 
explain why. If we are wrong, we will say so: "We are wrong." 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Russia is being overcome by a wave of 
crime. The government is indifferent to it, and crime goes 
unpunished. Where is the power of the authorities? 
  [Chernomyrdin] We are also very concerned about this. Crime 
is indeed on the rampage, and we have not made much progress in 
combating it. If every businessman is afraid of racketeers, and 
the ordinary citizen is afraid to go out on the street, who 
needs this kind of life? Special services are developing 
measures, but everything, alas, boils down to insufficient 
material resources and a weak legislative base. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] It is probably also partly your fault, 
your sin that crime has got so out of hand... 
  [Chernomyrdin] Since I am the chairman of the government, I 
cannot escape this responsibility. I do not. So it is my fault, 
too. Although my main criterion in work is authority and order. 
This is the way it will be in Russia. 
  [ARGUMENTY I FAKTY] Are you a believer? 
  [Chernomyrdin] I believe in myself. I would lie if I said I 
am a believer, but neither can I say that I am not. I grew up in 
a village among believers. I myself have been baptized. 
Generally, I am convinced that a person must believe in 
something; everyone should have his own God.

<F P=106> [Interview with E.A. Pamfilova, former minister of social </F>
protection of the population of Russia, by Galina Valyuzhenich, 
under the rubric "Moment for a Moral Choice"; place and date not 
given: "Why Ella Pamfilova Left"] 
  [Text] We can hardly name a statesman whose resignation was 
received by the common people as painfully as the departure of 
Ella Pamfilova from her position. Her name is associated with 
the notions of kindness and justice which the people now lack so 
badly. This is why people are calling, writing, and coming to 
us. Some ask with hope: "Is it really true? Could this be yet 
another rumor?" Others, aware of a good relationship between 
herself and our editorial office, plead: "Could you influence 
her?" A group of retirees visiting the editorial office was more 
categorically minded: "We will not let this happen: We are 
collecting signatures, we will go to Yeltsin himself. See what 
she has thought up--to abandon us!" 
  Hope, regret, pain, and disappointment ("she betrayed 
us")--everything has become intertwined. 
  Even when I was in the lobby awaiting her return from the 
president they approached me with just one request: Persuade 
her, talk her into staying on. 
  To tell you the truth, I was certain that the president 
would 
not accept her resignation. However, he did. 
  [Valyuzhenich] Ella Aleksandrovna, did you not decide to 
resign the ministerial post on an impulse? 
  [Pamfilova] No. It was neither on an impulse nor "to keep 
others company." I thought about this step for a long time, and 
it was not simple for me to take. My departure is a protest 
against disgracing the idea of the current reforms, which are 
becoming increasingly criminally-distributive, 
officialdom-oriented in nature. In essence, dealing with the 
consequences of an inconsistently implemented policy, I spent 
two years putting out fires. I consider it dishonest to 
participate in the implementation of a policy which I do not 
subscribe to and for which I cannot be held responsible, and my 
responsibilities are too great. It is impossible to protect the 
people without an opportunity to influence the elimination of 
the main causes engendering their defenselessness. 
  Destructive processes are mounting in the social sphere. The 
system of compensation for labor in sectors financed from the 
budget does not make it possible even for healthy young men with 
high levels of qualification to support their families. The 
phenomenon of a suicide epidemic has appeared, mainly among the 
men of the household. 
  Stressful situations--fear of losing a job, lack of funds 
for 
the most basic existence--anger people. As they get embittered, 
parents frequently take out their anger on their children. Do 
you know how many children now run away from home to escape the 
wrath of their parents? I know. What is happening to the 
technical professionals, who were initially democratic and 
progressively minded, those who are not adept at stealing and 
engaging in speculation?... People are sinking to the bottom, 
becoming alcoholics, and growing brutal. Work-related injuries 
are increasing; more and more disabled children are being born. 
Therefore, the ranks of my wards--those who are morally and 
physically crippled, orphans, invalids, and beggars--are being 
replenished every day, if not every hour. Rather than a 
nondescript mass, I see specific people with shattered lives 
behind the passionless numbers of statistical reports which few 
are concerned about. Perhaps this is the reason why it is so 
painful for me to witness how our unsinkable bureaucracy is 
getting fat against the background of the growing impoverishment 
of the people. 
  A situation is possible whereby retirees will be unable to 
receive even the retirement benefits guaranteed to them in the 
environment of a slump in production and nonpayments by 
enterprises, when less and less money is being taken in by the 
Retirement Fund and the number of retirees is increasing. How 
will I look people in the eye? I do not want to be responsible 
for the mistakes and miscalculations of others. 
  My departure is not a betrayal of the people who expect help 
from me. It is a fight for them. As I see it, it would be a 
betrayal to fail to live up to their expectations, to give 
hope--and as a result fail to provide the barest necessities. My 
departure is a form of protest by which I would like to attract 
attention to the fact that social policy cannot be reduced 
solely to emergency measures aimed at eliminating particular 
social evils, and that the measures currently proposed by the 
government will only worsen the situation. 
  [Valyuzhenich] History is aware of various forms of protest 
all the way to self-immolation; however, hardly anyone will be 
able to reliably determine how effective they are. Would you 
perhaps have a greater opportunity to influence the coordination 
of the policy pursued if you remained a minister? 
  [Pamfilova] The whole point is that I would not. I have 
already said repeatedly that the functions of sectoral 
ministries have been reduced to the level of dispatchers. All 
major policy decisions are made behind closed doors, by a narrow 
circle of advisers close to the prime minister. We have been 
assigned the roles of extras. Verbal populism in the government 
milieu is growing, but when it comes to making specific 
decisions everything that does not reflect the interests of 
certain corporate groups is torpedoed. 
  The last election made us understand that many mistakes were 
made in the policy pursued. It would appear that we should have 
sat down and analyzed them. Alas, nobody did this.... The 
meetings of the government still consider small, narrow issues. 
  At times, the situation borders on the absurd. For example, 
I 
cannot get an appointment with Chernomyrdin. Indeed, do not look 
surprised. I do not remember how many times I have signed up.... 
On one occasion I could not stand it and came to see him on 
Saturday without an appointment. So, what do you think? I waited 
by the door for a whole day.... 
  It even became hard to write in the press. Recently I called 
a press conference at the government press center, at which I 
was sharply critical. After I left, the journalists were 
instructed to provide no information in the press. My outrage 
with all of this has reached the limit. Under such 
circumstances, how can I influence policy coordination and the 
making of vital decisions? Even while holding the position of 
minister I was bound hand and foot. 
  What could I actually do if I retained my position? Open 
free 
canteens for the increasing number of beggars, shelters for the 
homeless, and orphanages for stray children? "Hack out" bonuses 
on top of retirement benefits and allowances which depreciate 
instantly, before they get to their recipients? For example, we 
had a great fight to increase the bonus for retirees effective 
in February, and we ensured this. I am ashamed to mention the 
amount--8,000. And this is happening in the environment of our 
inflation! How would you like me to look old people in the eye? 
What am I to tell them? This is just one example of the 
implementation of a strict financial policy. However, should it 
be tightened at the expense of minimum social guarantees? Is it 
really hard to understand that a social explosion is just one 
step away from this policy? I am pained and annoyed by my 
failure to convince the government that social policy is not an 
inflationary factor, not an impediment to reforms but rather the 
heart, the engine of them. 
  Recently I was called from a boarding school for crippled 
children and told that there was nothing to feed the children. 
They were down to one barrel of pickles. Can you believe 
this?--I did not even have an opportunity to help them because, 
you see, I am "not supposed" to dispose of funds allocated from 
the budget at my own discretion. For a whole year I hacked out 
$2 million for an orthopedic prosthesis factory in order to 
manufacture hands, feet, and footwear for the handicapped.... A 
whole year! Meanwhile, they are blowing hundreds of millions of 
dollars on repairing the White House and purchasing imported 
furniture. What is this? Is this not a feast in a time of famine? 
  No sooner had I left than they took away from the Social 
Support Fund, which reports to the ministry, the former party 
dachas in Uspenskoye which had been transferred to it at one 
point. We had leased out the dachas and organized recreation for 
crippled children with the proceeds. The money will now be 
pumped out of the dachas by those who deposit it in personal 
accounts at foreign banks. 
  Under the pretext of the election results, powerful 
"advocates of the state," for whom the main point is to preserve 
the system of allocation by officials as the principal source of 
gain, are now getting a grip on power. They are concerned about 
the redistribution of large properties, privatization, 
laundering of petrodollars generated through illegal 
transactions.... Do they have time for the suffering of the 
common man? 
  At present, the grabbing instinct is as developed as ever 
because there are things to grab. Compared to current abuses, 
those of the past appear to be child's play. Meanwhile, there is 
much talk about fighting corruption in the upper echelons of 
power, but all of this is verbiage, verbiage, verbiage.... The 
same corrupt bureaucracy bound by mutual guarantees holds sway. 
  I believe that those in power should set their moral, 
ethical 
standards very high, and should share with the people many of 
our objective differences. The authorities should be pure and 
honest. Only in this case will people respect and support them. 
  [Valyuzhenich] Your civic position is understandable. 
However, as they say, one always chooses the lesser of two evils. 
  [Pamfilova] I do not want to choose an evil, do you 
understand? I want to reverse the situation. 
  [Valyuzhenich] Do you believe that in the Duma you will have 
a greater opportunity to influence social policy? 
  [Pamfilova] I have no great delusions as to this. At any 
rate, I will not be responsible or pay for the mistakes of 
others. However, I do not intend to give up and acknowledge my 
powerlessness. I have the energy for a fight. 
  As you will understand, I did not seek personal gain when I 
resigned from my position. I think that they will now throw 
stones at my back; I have spited too many people: I interfered 
with someone "privatizing" a state dacha, with someone else 
pocketing a handsome sum, and dared to "criticize" someone.... 
Of course, it would have been more advantageous to continue in 
the position of minister. Some people even warned me that I was 
supposedly bringing my personal career to an end.... However, 
everyone has a moment when he makes a moral choice, and I have 
made mine.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Vedeneyev: "To Whom Is the Public Servant </F>
Subject?: The Struggle for Control of Officials of the 
Bureaucracy Continues"] 
  [Text] One of the marks of the past year was the tense 
struggle for the right to direct the large guild of Russian 
bureaucrats. It should be specified immediately, though, that 
their numbers are not, for that matter, as great as it would 
seem to many of our compatriots plagued by arbitrary 
administrative rule. Thus the number of employees of the organs 
of state and municipal administration in our country is 
comparable with the number of their colleagues in France, 
although our population is about three times larger. 
  But the urgent need for the speediest formation of the 
institution of a modern civil service in Russia has not lowered 
the intensity of the political passions which have flared up in 
this connection. The key proposals of a working group on reform 
of the civil service which had been formed in the Office of the 
President of the Russian Federation and which believe that it is 
the latter who should be at the head of the hierarchy of Russian 
officialdom in all branches of power were blocked back in the 
spring on the pretext of the possible opposition of the Supreme 
Soviet of the Russian Federation. 
  Instead of an edict on the establishment of a system of 
public service itself and the creation under the president of 
the Russian Federation of a body to administer it, there 
appeared an edict on priority measures for a reform of the civil 
service (which, strictly speaking, simply did not exist), 
according to which merely a consultative body--the Council for 
Personnel Policy--was formed under the president. One further 
edict creating an organ of administration of public service 
under the auspices of the government was prepared secretly in 
parallel in the machinery of the government and with the direct 
participation of the State Legal Administration (the draft edict 
with official signatures was found during a search in the office 
of V. Romanyukha, a senior official of the government 
bureaucracy). 
  Attempts were made once again at the start of November to 
remove from the jurisdiction of the president questions of 
leadership of the civil service and to convert the government 
bureaucracy into the organ of administration of public service 
(see NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA for 10 November). Directive N732-rp of 
the president of the Russian Federation on the formation of a 
working group to draw up a draft Statute on the Federal Civil 
Service of the Russian Federation issued shortly after this (and 
thanks, possibly, to the prompt intervention of NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA) was, seemingly, to have tightened the control of the 
actual head of state over the process of formation of a modern 
civil service in Russia. 
  But the supporters of the utmost strengthening of the 
positions of the government--even if thanks to the competent 
authority of the president--still made one further attempt a 
month later, more successful this time, to seize the initiative 
in the solution of this key question of our constitutional 
development. A tactical calculation on the inevitable law-making 
commotion on the eve of publication of the Constitution was made 
here. 
  On 23 December the president was hastily presented for 
signature--before the text of the new Constitution of the 
Russian Federation had been published--a draft edict on 
confirmation of the Statute on Federal Public Service. 
  The draft represented a hurriedly reworked version of this 
edict which had been prepared in secret in October-November in 
the government bureaucracy with the support of the State Legal 
Administration. That the Office of the President did not know 
about this edict follows, for example, from a remark of Mr. 
Filatov, who considered the adoption of a public service act a 
matter for the very near future (see ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA for 23 
December). 
  Given the multitude of provisions which have been referred 
back and which require the elaboration of additional legal 
enactments (this is precisely the task set in Edict No. 2267 of 
the President of the Russian Federation), it will take a long 
time for this document to become "passable" through an exacting 
representative body. So the adoption of the act any time soon is 
out of the question. 
  On the pretext of the lack of resolution of the question of 
the organ of administration of public service this fundamental 
issue was omitted from the text of the Statute on Federal Public 
Service proposed for confirmation, although it was this matter 
which could alone have justified the hasty signing of the 
corresponding edict prior to the Constitution having taken 
effect. 
  In the current situation a provision referring leadership of 
the institution of a civil service functioning in all branches 
of power to the jurisdiction of the president, as head of state 
and top official standing above all branches of power, will have 
to pass through the State Duma. There is no certainty here that 
the country's new legislative body will airily agree to such 
powers being reserved to the president. The present statute 
reduces them to the right to confer the class rank of "actual 
privy councillor." 
  The extension of the executive's control to an institution 
which should in principle encompass all branches of power would 
signify a violation of the principle of the separation of powers 
and the government's impermissible interference in the sphere of 
competence of the head of state. 
  The objective need for a strengthening of his role 
determines 
also the logic of the constitutional process in present-day 
Russia. Under the conditions of the immature political structure 
of society and undeveloped parliamentarianism, with most general 
notions of what kind of judiciary we should have, with the 
absence of harmony in the government, and without any experience 
of work in its possible coalition composition, alternative 
institutions of power based on traditional, rational-legal, or 
charismatic authority (primarily the institution of the 
presidency) remain the few guarantors of the preservation of 
statehood in the difficult period of the implementation of 
profound socioeconomic reforms. 
  It would be strange were the president to forgo the 
prerogative, natural for his status, of leadership of the 
federal civil service of the Russian Federation, agreeing to be 
merely an actor in the ritual dramatizations of conferment of a 
class rank, presentation of credentials, distribution of 
decorations, and so forth. It will become clear in the very near 
future whether the president retains this most important 
instrument of realization of his competent authority or entrusts 
it to someone else or whether someone who is most farsighted 
avails himself of it. 
  Who?

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Lysenko, a deputy of the State Duma and </F>
a cochairman of the Republican Party of Russia: "January Is a 
Bad Time for Parliaments in Russia (a Pessimist's Forecast)"] 
  [Text] The beginnings of the new Russian parliament--the 
Federal Assembly--do not provide grounds to be particularly 
optimistic. Parliamentarism does not transplant well into the 
Russian soil, which is so rich in totalitarian tradition. The 
Union parliament already has been dissolved "early;" the Russian 
Supreme Soviet has been disbanded. January is a jinxed month 
anyway: It was in January 1918 that the Bolsheviks disbanded the 
first truly democratically elected parliament in Russia--the 
Constituent Assembly. 
  Will the Federal Assembly survive the winter, will it be 
"luckier" than its predecessors? 
  I would like to be wrong, but I am afraid I am not. The new 
Russian parliament resembles a miscarried fetus of a tired 
country long pregnant by totalitarianism. After the tragic 
September-October events, it could hope to survive only if it 
grew into a quiet parliament standing ready to approve the 
decisions of the president and the government--such as, for 
instance, in Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan. This is what President 
B.N. Yeltsin hoped for in issuing his Edict No. 1400 on 21 
September. He miscalculated, though; the hypnosis of 
self-deception played a bad trick on him. The people no longer 
believed the promises of the president, the government, and the 
ruling bloc; the credit of confidence had run out. For the first 
time since 1985, the strength of the opponents of the current 
reform exceeded the strength of its supporters. Holding the 
course of tough economic reforms in keeping with the 
Yeltsin-Gaydar formula came into an irreconcilable conflict with 
the ability of pushing them through within the framework of the 
new parliament as well. 
  The main result of the elections is that half of the popular 
vote went to pro-communist and national-patriotic forces, who 
are even more conservative when it comes to the transformations 
under way than their predecessors in the Supreme Soviet had 
been; whose modus operandi is rejection; and for whom the crux 
of their political position is revanche. These forces are 
organically incompatible with the president, with the current 
government, and the new Constitution alike. They bear little 
resemblance to the right in Hungary or the Czech Republic, or to 
the left in Lithuania and Poland, who recently came into power 
through parliamentary elections and who observe the commonly 
accepted rules of the game. The national-communist opposition in 
Russia, which draws on the marginal strata of the society--which 
now includes a considerable part of the population--operates on 
slogans turned toward yesterday (all power to the soviets; the 
restoration of the Russian empire....); for them the parliament 
is the same means of achieving their revolutionary (or perhaps 
it would be more precise to say counterrevolutionary) goals as 
it is for President Yeltsin to see through to the end the 
"revolution from above," the revolutionary reform. 
  In a normal, civilized, stable society, parties of this type 
draw on the support of 5-10 percent of the electorate, and as a 
rule they remain on the sidelines of the political process. In a 
troubled transitional time, however, on a wave of a crisis and 
increasing popular discontent over the worsening conditions of 
life, disintegration of authority, and the powerlessness of 
immature democratic institutions, they get their historic 
chance, as happened in Russia in October 1917 or in Germany in 
1933. 
  Russia today has not yet reached a state where various 
political parties could replace one another at the helm of power 
as a result of elections without creating sharp cataclysms and 
destabilization of the situation in the country. Its political 
system is still dominated by extremes, and centrist forces are 
still very weak. In the environment of the intensifying economic 
crisis, this is a clear indicator of an urgent need to shift to 
a "managed" democracy or an authoritarian regime. The past three 
months of direct presidential rule graphically demonstrated that 
the executive branch has increasingly less need for the 
legislative one; that, having once tasted the "freedom" from 
various checks and balances, it will not want to waste time and 
effort on another round of "score-settling" with the new 
parliament. 
  Therefore, one does not have to be a great prophet to see 
that it is in the interests of the powers that be to see the 
Russian parliament discredited as quickly as 
possible--preferably by its own hand. At the same time, it is 
necessary to stick to the rules of good behavior: The 
parliament's exit from the political arena should not "irritate" 
world public opinion, and neither should it produce a real 
contender for the president's job in 1996. Now all sorts of 
politicians and advisers are racking their brains as to when is 
the best time to put into action Article 111 of the new 
Constitution (on disbanding the parliament after it rejects 
three times the candidacy of a new prime minister proposed by 
the president) so as not to leave to the State Duma an 
opportunity to make the first step of initiating the impeachment 
of the president. 
  As to the problem of discrediting the State Duma, this is 
being taken care of by the leaders of most parliamentary 
factions, who are incapable of coming to an agreement on a 
single key issue, with the exception of returning the White 
House to the parliament. And there is little chance for reaching 
such agreement given such a weak center and such strong radical 
flanks. It is not accidental that the government bloc, Russia's 
Choice, already has refused to participate in negotiations, 
holding up its sleeve a trump card--the materials on numerous 
violations of election rules--that will be used as soon as the 
need arises. 
  It is obvious that the session of the State Duma will follow 
a spontaneous scenario, without aim or direction. In 1990, it 
took three days to elect B. Yeltsin the speaker of the Russian 
parliament; it is hard even to imagine how long this procedure 
will take in 1994, especially keeping in mind that with the 
exception of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and 
the RKP [Communist Party of Russia], other factions most likely 
will not maintain strict discipline in matters of voting. So 
while the session will be embroiled for several weeks in 
attempts to resolve routine internal issues (the rules, the law 
on a deputy status, distribution of portfolios....), the leaders 
of the new irreconcilable rightist-leftist opposition will rock 
the "foundations" of the presidential power; they will: 
  --demand a parliament investigation of the 3-4 October 
events 
and setting up a commission on investigating the circumstances 
and the consequences of signing the Belovezha agreements in 1991; 
  --attempt to annul the results of the referendum on the 
Constitution; 
  --insist on dismissing the cases against GKChP [State 
Committee on the State of Emergency] members and the organizers 
of the events of September-October 1993; 
  --propose to repeal president's edicts on land, on the 
Ministry of Security, and others; 
  --express no-confidence in the government under Article 
117-3 
of the new Constitution; 
  --call for the restoration of the Constitutional Court in 
its 
old composition and for this court to render a definitive 
judgment on the events of September-October 1993; 
  --come up with militant statements with respect to countries 
of the near and far abroad. 
  All of this will be happening against a backdrop of 
intrafactional score-settling, for most factions consist of 
people who are not inclined to march to the same drum and listen 
to one leader. 
  With skillful assistance, the State Duma could be turned 
into 
a theater of the absurd in a matter of two months. Then later--a 
paralysis of the parliamentary, workers' requests, Article 111 
of the Constitution, and the disbandment of the State Duma. The 
president will continue to rule the country with the help of the 
Federation Council--a more complaisant structure which will 
convene from time to time to approve presidential decrees. Also 
at "the workers' request," the parliament for the time being 
will exist as a one-chamber body, and it is well known that 
there nothing more permanent in Russia than temporary 
institutions. 
  Everything above is the viewpoint of a skeptic who has spent 
three years of his life trying to make the previous Russian 
parliament a more civilized body by creating in it a centrist 
majority. The failure of these attempts as a result of the 
December elections does not make me an optimist again. 
  But my, how much would I like to be wrong....

<F P=106> [Article by Yekaterina Achalova under the rubric "Election </F>
Results": "`Women of Russia' Turned Out Most Frugal of All"] 
  [Text] Today the economic-financial commission of the 
Central Electoral Commission completed a review of preliminary 
financial reports of 13 electoral coalitions. The Control and 
Audit Administration under the Central Electoral Commission will 
conduct a complete audit of the reports in the first half of 
January. On their part, the blocs practically completed the 
compilation and analysis of expenditures. 
  The second installment of money provided by the Central 
Electoral Commission to electoral coalitions (R50 million) 
reached the addressees only on 6 December; therefore, many 
simply did not have enough time to put it to use. In keeping 
with Yeltsin's edict, the remainder of the money will be 
transferred to the Central Electoral Commission's operational 
account. 
  Of the blocs that made it to the parliament, the least 
amount 
of money was spent on the election campaign by Women of 
Russia--R67 million. This coalition had not received money from 
any source other than the Central Electoral Commission, and the 
money from the latter was mainly used for advertising in the 
mass media. 
  The Communist Party of Russia, in addition to the money 
allocated by the state, also spent about R2 million from party 
dues. As Gennadiy Zyuganov told a KOMMERSANT correspondent, the 
propaganda work was conducted by communists on a "person to 
person" basis and therefore turned out very cheap and highly 
effective. 
  The Democratic Party of Russia spent approximately R400-R500 
million. In the opinion of Yevgeniy Malkin, the chief of the 
Democratic party's election headquarters, this money had been 
used to a maximum effect: The party's rating increased 
proportionally to increases in expenditures for expansion of 
political advertising and pre-election propaganda. 
  According to Russia's Choice finance officers, the bloc has 
spent almost R2 billion. 
  The Liberal Democratic Party did not submit information on 
its election campaign expenditures. However, Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy said earlier that they had spent about R1 billion 
on propaganda. 
  The Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc spent R380 million. As 
Igor Yakovenko, a State Duma deputy and a cochairman of the 
Republican Party of Russia, told a KOMMERSANT correspondent, the 
money probably could have been used more effectively had it not 
been for the bloc's organizational weakness: It had been set up 
close to elections and its participants did not have enough time 
to "get used to each other," and therefore the potential of each 
was only utilized to a small extent. 
  The Agrarian Party of Russia did not go for outside 
financing 
sources, and only managed to spend one-half of the R100 million 
allocated by the Central Electoral Commission.

<F P=106> [Untitled commentary by the KOMMERSANT-DAILY Economic Policy </F>
Department] 
  [Text] Fierce election competition made the already-narrow 
boundaries of Central Bank's special accounts too restrictive 
for more energetic electoral coalitions. The specificity of 
advertising activities made using cash especially tempting. 
Strict reporting requirements, however, made it impossible to 
use this instrument legally. 
  Therefore, it is unlikely that the official documentation of 
electoral coalitions regarding receipts and expenditures of 
money from electoral special accounts reflected the true budgets 
party finance officers operated with in the course of election 
campaign. By unofficial estimates, most coalitions spent 
considerable amounts of cash not reported to the Central 
Electoral Commission. By the estimates of specialists in the 
Ministry of Press and Information, overall the coalitions may 
have spent between 100 and 150 million rubles [R] from the 
"black cash box" on the preparation and distribution of 
advertising materials. This practice, of course, is just 
beginning to become a special feature of election campaigns in 
Russia. In developed democracies it is an inalienable part of 
politics as a whole and elections in particular. The so-called 
"street" (or "sick leave," etc.), which refers to large amounts 
of cash distributed on behalf of candidates, have been a subject 
of numerous political scandals in the United States. It appears 
that such scandals are inevitable in Russia as well. One may 
assume that the first signals of violations on the part of 
competitors will start coming to the control and audit service 
of the Central Electoral Commission at the time when tough 
interparty fighting begins in the Federal Assembly.

  When an individual is accepted into the state service there 
shall be no direct or indirect restrictions based on race, sex,

corresponding position; 
  if he has a close relationship or kinship (parents, spouses, 
their brothers, sisters, and children, and also the brothers, 
sisters, parents, and children of spouses) with a state employee 
if their service involves direct subordination and direct 
supervision of one by the other. 
  22. Acceptance for state service is carried out through 
assignment or competition if the individual has the appropriate 
education, work experience, and qualifications for the state 
position unless otherwise stipulated by the law of the Russian 
Federation.

  The qualifications examination shall be received by the

  In the qualifications examination the qualifications 
commission shall evaluate the state employee's level of 
knowledge of the Constitution of the Russian Federation and 
other legislative acts of the Russian Federation as well as his

procedure established by legislative acts of the Russian 
Federation. 
  25. The state employee shall submit, in keeping with the 
procedure established by legislative acts of the Russian 
Federation: 
  upon entry into the state service--information about his 
property position; 
  annually--information about incomes and changes in his 
property position. 
  Failure to submit this information or distortion of it shall 
be grounds for rejection for state service or for bringing 
disciplinary charges against the state employee. 
  26. For a citizen appointed to a state position for the 
first 
time or appointed to a state position in a different group or of 
a different kind, a probationary period in the state position 
shall be established for a period of from three to six months. 
Periods when the state employee was absent do not count for the 
probationary period. The present Statute shall apply to the 
state employee during the probationary period. 
  If the leader of a state organ deems the result of the 
probation unsatisfactory, by a decision of the competition 
commission the state employee may be recommended for appointment 
to the state position he held previously or, with his consent, 
another state position, or he may be discharged from the state 
service. 
  If after the probationary period no negative decisions are 
reached concerning the suitability of the state employee for 
work in the position he holds, he is considered to have passed 
probation, no additional decisions are made concerning his 
appointment, and the probationary period is included in his

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Ryabov: "Universal Soldier Without a </F>
Military Uniform"] 
  [Text] Yuriy Baturin, the president's new national 
security adviser, remains an unknown personality even to the 
head of state. 
  The president has formed a new structure in the Kremlin. On 
6 
January Boris Yeltsin signed an edict appointing the 44-year-old 
lawyer Yuriy Baturin to the office of the president's national 
security adviser. The pre-New Year reform of the former KGB was 
continued on Christmas Eve. 
  The new Kremlin institution has an obvious counterpart in 
the 
office of the American President. In the United States the 
security adviser not only coordinates the activity of the power 
departments and intelligence. His role is far more important. It 
is sufficient to recall the influence of Zbigniew Brzezinski 
under Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger under Richard Nixon on 
the foreign policy of the White House administration. 
  Considering also that Russia is today a state with 
predominant presidential power, it may be assumed that the 
president's new adviser could have considerable influence in the 
affairs of state. 
<H5>  For What Merits? </H5>
  Yuriy Baturin is, evidently, destined to play the part of 
chief strategist in the president's team on matters of national 
security. What merits and qualities should such a person 
possess? What is the nature of his interaction with the 
president and the president's circle? 
  Bill Clinton's assistant for national security, Anthony 
Lake, 
has several features in common with Yuriy Baturin. 
  Lake is a college lecturer, teaching a course in 
international relations. Yuriy Baturin has also been involved in 
lecturing activity in the Moscow State University Journalism 
Faculty. 
  Both are distinguished by plain dealing. True, the 
experienced Lake has had more opportunities to demonstrate it. 
Back in 1970 he tendered his resignation as assistant to U.S. 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in protest against the war in 
Vietnam. Baturin displayed a certain refractoriness in 
criticizing the president's actions at the time of the 
dissolution of the Supreme Soviet last fall. 
  According to THE NEW YORK TIMES, Lake "can alter his 
position 
on any issue if he believes that this is what the situation 
requires." The adviser to the Russian president also amended his 
words when Boris Yeltsin's decisiveness fell into the category 
of strict but necessary measures. 
  Both advisers say very little about their foreign policy 
views, preferring silent but eloquent action. 
  The differences in the position of Lake and Baturin in the 
presidential teams are more appreciable than the similarities. 
  Anthony Lake has known Bill Clinton for 24 years now. Yuriy 
Baturin became a member of the Presidential Council less than a 
year ago, on 17 March 1993. In addition, as distinct from 
Anthony Lake's well-oiled relations with the American 
President's entire team and the power ministers, Yuriy Baturin 
is closely acquainted with practically no one. He met Nikolay 
Golushko only last August. He met Sergey Stepashin, first deputy 
director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, only a few 
days ago at a news conference. He knows no one from Pavel 
Grachev's ministry. He has met with Viktor Yerin only a few 
times. Yuriy Baturin's closest acquaintance is Yevgeniy 
Primakov. They got to know one another at the end of the 1980's. 
  So who is he--this mysterious national security adviser? 
<H5>  He Did Not Sleep at Night </H5>
  Having graduated from a Moscow school, in 1967 Yuriy Baturin 
entered what was at that time the strongest technical higher 
educational institution--the Moscow Physico-Technical Institute. 
But even during his schooling he thought of working not only in 
the exact sciences but in current affairs activity also. 
Journalism was his dream. 
  He retains the habit of resolving all problems by the 
inveterate "grease-monkey" method--studying the range of 
questions, identifying the essence, finding an effective 
solution. Such a method helps him confront all difficulties. 
  Another habit has been retained also--sleeping little and 
working a lot. As his former classmates tell it, even against 
the background of the customary industriousness of many of the 
"phys-tech" students Baturin was distinguished by an incredible 
capacity for work. 
  Aside from his main classes, he studied philosophy, 
political 
science, and literature. He wrote his first article on 
international relations in the institute. Having as a student 
chosen for himself the hobby of study of foreign languages, 
today he knows English, Japanese, French, Swedish, 
Serbo-Croatian, and German. 
  It is said that there were evenings when Yuriy Baturin, as a 
listener, could not hold out and fell asleep from overtiredness. 
But when the power of narrator switched to him, he was 
transformed and forgot about his tiredness. 
  Graduating from the "phys-tech" in 1973, Yuriy Baturin went 
to work at the Space Research Institute. Having spent seven 
years there, he abruptly, at first sight, changed the nature of 
his activity, switching to the Institute of State and Law. 
  At the start of the 1980's Baturin acquired a further two 
educations--at the All-Union Legal Institute and at the Moscow 
State University Journalism Faculty. 
  For some period Yuriy Baturin acknowledged that he had 
acquired a "second wind" in the field of current affairs 
writing. He forced himself to discourse lightly on the most 
diverse topics. As of a particular moment it was all the same to 
him what subject he took--the law, politics, or computer 
crime.... He was published in our journal also. 
  Many of his works are distinguished by a saturation with 
ironical passages. And his political articles were sometimes 
nontraditional also. In one highly serious digest, for example, 
he published an article entitled "The Songs of Vladimir 
Vysotskiy as Poetical-Political Journalism." 
  It was thanks to the original work "Law and Policy in the 
Computer Sphere," incidentally, that Yuriy Baturin was invited 
to the American Prospective Russian Research Institute [as 
published] in Washington in 1990 in order that he might take 
part in devising support backing for computer security in U.S. 
legislation. 
<H5>  Translator of Pamphlets </H5>
  Nor did Candidate of Legal Sciences Yuriy Baturin escape the 
notice of Soviet legislators. 
  In 1989 he devised in conjunction with two authorities, one 
of whom was Mikhail Fedotov, former minister of press and 
information, the first originating draft constitutional law in 
Soviet legislation. This was the News Media Act. The coauthors 
offered the public the act before the USSR Supreme Soviet made 
public its draft. 
  In 1991 Yuriy Baturin began work on the staff of Georgiy 
Shakhnazarov, the former editor of his scientific articles, who 
at that time was an assistant to Mikhail Gorbachev. Baturin was 
one of those who prepared the well-known Union Treaty. 
  After the 1991 putsch and the departure of the president of 
the USSR and his team from the political arena which followed 
this, Yuriy Baturin retired into the background, although 
continuing to work at the Gorbachev Foundation. 
  The year following the putsch Yuriy Baturin became a doctor 
of legal sciences. He devoted much time, as before, to current 
affairs writing, frequently locking himself in his book-strewn 
two-room apartment on Leninskiy prospekt. He published a 
translation of a pamphlet by Lewis Carroll. In order to remain 
in the public view Yuriy Baturin accepted an offer of the 
producers of the television program "Itogi" that he be its chief 
political consultant. 
  Last March Yuriy Baturin switched to a position on the 
Presidential Council. 
<H5>  Analytical Center in Place of a Network of Spies </H5>
  It is hard to say on whose recommendation, it was surely 
someone's, but Boris Yeltsin noticed Yuriy Baturin. Last March 
and somewhat later, when, on 2 June, Baturin became the 
president's assistant for legal matters, and on 6 January of 
this year. It can be seen, in any event, that the protection has 
been of a purely professional nature. 
  It is also important that the position of specialist 
connected with the work of the security authorities and army 
structures has for the first time been offered to a person who 
has studied warfare only in an institute department. 
  Who, for all that, was that adviser from the "small group," 
as Baturin himself said? 
  The "small group" could have included Yuriy Skokov, leader 
of 
the Security Council, and Gennadiy Burbulis, who, probably, 
knows Yuriy Baturin from the times of the work on the Union 
Treaty. It could have been Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, 
whose favorite, Mikhail Fedotov, knows Baturin's merits well 
enough. 
  What remains of most importance in the appointment of the 
new 
adviser is, undoubtedly, not "who proposed him" but "what he 
will do." 
  In the immediate future he will, obviously, devise the 
concept of the work of the new structure. This will, possibly, 
be a massive analytical office designed to coordinate the 
activity of the power ministries. 
  The center of gravity of the control of the state security 
authorities will in this case be in the president's camp instead 
of the Ministry of Security. Especially since certain functions 
of the security authority are already being performed by the 
Office of Protection of the President. 
  And, obviously, the strategic function, not the function of 
all-powerful "state within a state" for all of life's 
contingencies, will be predominant with the new office.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Todres: "Gaydar and Fedorov As an </F>
Appetizer for Subsidies; the Regions Have Prepared To Get What 
They Have Coming to Them] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Territories </H5>
  It was not difficult to foresee the restrainedly satisfied 
reaction of the regional authorities to the changes in the 
Russian Cabinet of Ministers. 
  The general attitude, it appears, was expressed by Leonid 
Polezhayev, the newly elected leader of the Siberian Agreement 
association and the head of administration of Omsk Oblast: 
"Gaydar left because the leadership of the country, 'and 
especially Yeltsin,' finally realized the need to rectify 
reform--first and foremost on questions of social protection and 
the revival of Russia's industrial production.'" 
  It was the provincial chiefs who demanded changes in general 
policy from the government, proposing that the cabinet 
leadership itself look into "personnel support" of adjustments. 
As far as SEGODNYA knows, at the famous luncheon with Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, where the local bosses were being urged, 
nonetheless, to elect Vladimir Shumeyko speaker of the 
Federation Council, they refrained from being more precise about 
personally whose heads should fall as a result. Only Buryat 
Prime Minister Vladimir Saganov repeated his eternal refrain 
that "we will never achieve anything with this Fedorov." 
  Now, even compliments can be heard following the reformers 
who left. Irkutsk Governor Yuriy Nozhikov and Viktor Ignatenko, 
the head of representative authority, think that "the government 
aircraft still should have two wings--both directorial and 
macroeconomic." But Vyacheslav Novikov, a Krasnoyarsk colleague 
of Mr. Ignatenko, even declared that "not to give money is a 
remarkable quality for a minister of finance, and Boris Fedorov 
had it." 
  Now, the "fathers of remote places" are contentedly awaiting 
the material results of "adjustments in the direction of 
selective support of the regions and enterprises." In the words 
of Primorye Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, 35 billion rubles [R] 
in fuel subsidies have already been transferred to the 
territory. Out of this, Valentin Dubinin, his deputy, 
distributed R5 billion to those rayons and cities where heating 
and water were starting to be cut off because of a shortage of 
fuel. Vyacheslav Novikov expressed the hope that a certain 
sum--"in the form of a credit or subsidy"--would be received 
quickly by power engineering specialists of Krasnoyarsk Kray, 
where because of nonpayments the miners of the Borodino open pit 
mines were threatening to stop dispatching coal. 
  The oil workers of Western Siberia warned of the possibility 
of a strike--strike committees have already been established 
there in 12 oil and gas production associations. Yuriy 
Shafranik, the minister of the fuel and power industry, called 
for a sharp reduction yesterday in taxes for them, "inasmuch as 
the power engineering specialists who are delivering fuel 
despite the nonpayments are now actually engaged in 
interest-free extension of credits for the entire economy of 
Russia." 
  The parliament of the Republic of Karelia Thursday resolved 
to try to get a substantial reduction in taxes from Moscow on 
profits for enterprises of Karelia. Sergey Yaskulov, its first 
vice prime minister, justifies this with the fact that "the 
volume of industrial production in Karelia amounts to 81 percent 
of the 1992 level, the differentiation in agricultural and 
industrial incomes has become too wide, and there is a 
noticeable worsening in the demographic situation." His 
colleague, Anatoliy Maksimov, sits in Moscow without budging 
from the place, lobbying for the demands of the region--but to 
the indignation of the leadership of the republic, "he has been 
unable to dislodge any kind of money up until now, even what is 
due northern Karelia." 
  A coordinating council of Siberian Agreement on questions of 
conversion is supposed to convene Tuesday in Omsk. In the 
opinion of observers, it obviously intends to use the 
reorganization of the government to demand additional money from 
Moscow for the local VPK [military industrial complex]. 
  It seems that the possibility of success among all of the 
enumerated regional lobbyists is rather high. Especially when it 
is considered that at a press conference Thursday, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin promised "immediately to settle up with the most 
pressing debts--first and foremost for wages, the VPK, the 
'northerners,' and the agro-industrial complex." 
  As for the agrarians, they will personally state their 
claims 
to the prime minister and to Aleksandr Zaveryukha, his deputy, 
and no later than Tuesday, when the leadership of 18 
agricultural oblasts of central and southern Russia convene in 
Orel. As Aleksandr Mayorov, Orel deputy governor, declared to 
SEGODNYA, "They have still not paid us R10 billion for grain, 
and the situation is about the same in the rest of the oblasts." 
However, Mr. Zaveryukha, without waiting for the meeting in 
Orel, has already promised to settle up all agrarian debts in 
the sum of R1.3 trillion by the end of January. 
  Against all of this background, it is rather difficult to 
understand the statement of the prime minister that "there is no 
kind of branch pressure." The pressure, which was clear even 
before Gaydar's and Fedorov's resignations from the government, 
is growing along the entire front with increased strength. And 
strong doubts exist that the cabinet will be able to cope with 
it, while remaining within the framework of "selective" 
additional feeding with meaningless money.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Gorodetskaya: "The First President of </F>
Chuvashia Assumes Office; His Primary Tasks--To Form a 
Government and To Acquire Subsidies From Russia's Budget"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Republics </H5>
  Yesterday at a session of the parliament of Chuvashia in 
Cheboksary, Nikolay Fedorov, who was elected the first president 
of the republic in national elections on 16 December 1993, was 
ceremonially inducted into office. Leaders of federal structures 
and presidents of neighboring republics attended the inaugural 
ceremonies. 
  Nikolay Vasilyevich Fedorov was born in 1958 in the Chuvash 
SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] into a peasant family. He is a 
Chuvash. He is a lawyer by education. He worked as a senior 
instructor in the department of scientific communism of the 
Chuvash State University. After his election in 1989 as USSR 
people's deputy, he moved to Moscow. He was a member of the USSR 
Supreme Soviet, and he headed one of the subcommittees on 
questions of legislation, legality, and law and order. He 
participated in the development of laws on the press and on the 
rights and duties of the Internal Troops of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs of the USSR. He was appointed Minister of 
Justice of the RSFSR in July 1990. He was a member of the CPSU 
until August 1991. In January of 1992, he spoke against the 
edict of the president on the establishment of the Ministry of 
Security and Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation. At the 
Eighth Congress of People's Deputies, he came out with a 
statement that the legislative activity of the Russian 
Federation does not always confine itself to the scope of the 
Constitution. He retired in April of 1993. He is married and has 
two children. 
  During the inauguration, Nikolay Fedorov took the oath in 
two 
languages--Russian and Chuvash--to apply all of his strength to 
lead the economy of the republic out of the crisis situation and 
to promote an increase in the well-being of the people. To the 
sound of the Chuvash national anthem, those in attendance were 
told that the first president of the republic had assumed 
office, in commemoration of which young people in national 
costumes presented Nikolay Fedorov with bread, salt, and beer. 
According to long-standing tradition, a festive concert was held 
after the ceremonial performance. 
  Having finished celebrating, both the new president of 
Chuvashia and the parliament will have to begin work "on 
increasing the well-being of the people." Valerian Viktorov, the 
head of the Cabinet of Ministers, sent in his resignation, 
because he was elected chairman of the Federation Council of 
Russia. According to the republic's legislation, the entire 
cabinet is also supposed to follow him. Thus, Nikolay Fedorov's 
presidency will begin with the formation of a new government, in 
coordination with parliament. Parliament is supposed to return 
to a consideration of the budget for 1994, which was interrupted 
because of the inauguration of the president. This is a very 
complicated question for Chuvashia, inasmuch as it had been 
receiving a third of its resources as subsidies from the Russian 
budget. The size of the subsidies is unknown, since the federal 
budget has not been ratified. And indeed there should be no 
particular counting on Russia's investment this year: As was 
said by Nikolay Smirnov, the present minister of finance of the 
republic, they can be received only by the territories that are 
acknowledged to be in adverse circumstances. In forming its own 
budget, which has not yet been coordinated with the Moscow 
budget, the republic, nevertheless, hopes to join the adverse 
circumstances category, inasmuch as the volume of products fell 
by 40 percent in 1993.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dzhokhar Dudayev by Yakhya Akiyev; date not </F>
given: "Dzhokhar Dudayev Indirectly Confirmed the Presence of 
SS-20 Missiles in Chechnya"] 
  [Text] Groznyy, Chechnya--[Akiyev] How did you view the 
recent statement of the mayor of Moscow on the expulsion of 
"persons of Caucasian nationality," are you not about to adopt 
similar measures? 
  [Dudayev] My good sense has not quit on me yet, and good 
sense has stopped working long since in any person who calls for 
physical violence on a national basis. The Almighty will not, I 
believe, let me drop to this level. Grant me the strength not to 
sink to the level of the barbarian and respond with such methods 
to citizens of my republic: this would be blasphemy on my part. 
  [Akiyev] A multitude of publications and statements of the 
special services concerned that SS-20 missiles are allegedly 
deployed on the territory of Chechnya have appeared lately. 
Please comment on this. 
  [Dudayev] Are we not worried that a quantity of nuclear 
potential which could wipe out the world in a matter of days has 
been stockpiled on the territory of other countries? We are 
entitled to our defense, like all peoples. 
  [Akiyev] And the international agreements on the 
nonproliferation of nuclear weapons? 
  [Dudayev] There is in the world the law of the strong. No 
one 
observes other laws or juridical, humane, or legal provisions. 
Only strength is recognized. 
  [Akiyev] You believe that only the wolf's laws operate? 
  [Dudayev] Yes. And the stronger the state, the more strongly 
it extends these wolf's laws to the weak and merely hides behind 
the screen of the law. All these are ways to further torture 
peoples that are small and incapable of survival. 
  [Akiyev] The news media reported that you met with Bill 
Clinton during his election campaign. 
  [Dudayev] The point is that this meeting could not have had 
a 
positive influence on Bill Clinton's campaign and could have 
turned the situation against him. Not every meeting in the 
personal interests of one party has a positive influence on the 
other. I turned down this meeting as far as possible, therefore; 
Bill Clinton's opponents could have used it against him. 
  [Akiyev] Does Chechnya as of the present have diplomatic 
relations with countries of the "far abroad" and with which 
precisely? 
  [Dudayev] Diplomatic relations with half the countries of 
the 
world. 
  [Akiyev] Are they enshrined legally? Does Chechnya have 
embassies and missions in other countries, as in sovereign 
states? 
  [Dudayev] As in sovereign states, we have missions in many 
countries of the world. And if it is a question of the 
recognition to which the world is accustomed, we do not need 
this recognition, we reject it and will continue to reject it. 
  [Akiyev] But this is irrational. 
  [Dudayev] It is rational. 
  [Akiyev] The world is the world, and this is an aggregate of 
all the nations in the world, and you are required to observe 
primarily statutes and laws. 
  [Dudayev] We must observe our interests, and our interests 
consist of not succumbing to the euphoria to which Azerbaijan, 
Tajikistan, Moldova, and other republics of the state succumbed. 
No sooner had they crowed about this recognition than 
disintegration set in. What happened in Georgia? The world 
recognized Georgia. The intelligentsia and the whole people 
stood up in support of Gamsakhurdia when Georgia acquired its 
sovereign law. And what? Political forces embarked on a power 
struggle. Gamsakhurdia has perished.... 
  [Akiyev] I would like to ask you about Chechnya's refusal to 
take part in the elections. How do you justify this refusal?! 
You could have found a compromise with Russia and have sent your 
observers to the State Duma, to the Federal Assembly. 
  [Dudayev] First, no one invited us as observers, second, 
what 
is the Duma today? We were citizens of the USSR. This juridical, 
legal base has been demolished. The initial demolition came from 
deprivation of citizenship of the USSR. And Russia was a subject 
of the USSR. There is no citizenship in Russia as of the present 
either, I believe, and all elections have been pointless, 
consequently. 
  [Akiyev] What do you think of Ingushetia's problems? Does it 
not seem to you that the entire economic potential, which was 
accumulated by both the Chechen and the Ingush, has remained on 
the territory of Chechnya and that Ingushetia is in the position 
of a girl without a dowry? 
  [Dudayev] For 75 years both the Chechen and the Ingush were 
bequeathed the most onerous legacy throughout the former Soviet 
Union. According to the statistical data of Russia of 1990, 
Chechnya was in 73d place in social development. We were left 
with the highest infant mortality. We were left with the highest 
percentage of tuberculosis morbidity and intestinal disease. We 
inherited the most devastated economy. All resources were pumped 
out of here for 100 years. So neither the Chechen nor the Ingush 
were left with any technical potential or production. The legacy 
was identical. We are EQUALLY POOR! 
  [Akiyev] Will Russians, Chechen, and Ingush ever see a Boris 
Nikolayevich and Dzhokhar Dudayev hand-shaking ceremony? 
  [Dudayev] I am sure of one thing: Russia could win an 
unprecedented victory in the Caucasus were Chechnya to shake 
Russia's hand. Russia's 500-year endeavor could be eclipsed by 
this handshake. This would be the most dazzling victory in the 
Caucasus. If it does not want this victory, this is its PROBLEM. 
  [Akiyev] So you are not, for all that, prepared to meet? 
  [Dudayev] Not only not prepared, I reject this meeting. For 
any meeting a base has to be prepared, and it should produce a 
conclusive result. 
  [Akiyev] You mean, recognition of Chechnya? 
  [Dudayev] Not entirely. We have been recognized by the 
Almighty. 
  [Akiyev] But the Almighty has, I believe, recognized all 
mankind? 
  [Dudayev] We are an indigenous nation here. This land was 
given us by the Almighty, and we have a right to administer it 
independently of the wishes of any other state. 
  [Akiyev] Your attitude toward the measures that have been 
adopted in respect to your fiercest enemies: Rutskoy and 
Khasbulatov. 
  [Dudayev] I can assure you that neither Rutskoy nor 
Khasbulatov were ever my enemies. 
  [Akiyev] But political foes? 
  [Dudayev] Not entirely. They have their interests in their 
state, and as far as Chechnya is concerned, had some others been 
in their place, the attitude toward them could have been even 
worse. They are people of their time and their structure, and I 
am far from thinking that they are my foes. But I will say 
unequivocally that their being incarcerated will not improve the 
situation in Russia. Khasbulatov is a son of the Chechen people, 
he was raised and educated by Chechnya, and, whatever he did 
against Chechnya while in Russia's power structures, he will 
remain a most gifted politician of our time. 
<H5>  From the editors: </H5>
  Mr. Dudayev's answers were not emended for style. We deemed 
it possible to leave without comment the president's graphic 
expressions, especially since two days ago he conferred on 
Chechnya by edict a new name--the Republic of Ichkeria.

IZVESTIYA: "War and Peace in Prigorodnyy Rayon"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  I. CASUS BELLI </H5>
  Issa Kostoyev, the president of Russia's representative in 
the Ingush Republic, returned to Nazran at about midday on 31 
October. He had not been able to accomplish in Moscow any of the 
things he considered critical and urgent. A Russian procuracy 
special affairs investigator and professional analyst, he saw 
the inner interconnection of events; he knew where it may all 
end, but he had not been able to avert any of it. He had asked 
the president for an audience many times--through the audit 
administration or in personal cables--but never received a reply. 
  Meanwhile, he was getting telephone calls from Nazran every 
day. And every day the news was increasingly more alarming. 
  An APC [armored personnel vehicle] speeding along a rural 
street ran over and killed an Ingush girl. An investigation 
found the driver not at fault. A day later an officer of the 
North Ossetian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] shot and 
killed two Ingush. The republic procurator released the murderer 
from detention. A group of Ossetian militiamen encountered a 
crowd of agitated Ingush. Three Ingush and two militiamen were 
killed in the clash. The militiamen were given a ceremonial 
burial; Galazov himself, as well as members of the government, 
were present... 
  Kostoyev saw that the Ossetian militia had no hesitation in 
aggravating the situation, and could guess who needed this and 
why. 
  The Ingush' spontaneous rage had to be stopped; they had to 
be prevented from being drawn into an armed conflict that was 
doomed. Reckless emotions, or perhaps also the ambition of some 
authoritative Ingush figures, were pushing them into a 
skillfully set trap. On 24 October at a joint session of three 
rayon soviets in Nazran the decision was made to block entry to 
and exit from Ingush villages in Prigorodnyy Rayon, and to call 
up volunteers to form self-defense brigades and subordinate them 
to a headquarters consisting of rayispolkom [rayon executive 
committees] leaders and the OVD [Department of Internal Affairs]. 
  When Justice General Issa Kostoyev learned of this, he 
realized that the Ossetian leadership had been handed a "casus 
belli"--a pretext for war: creation of illegitimate organs of 
authority on its territory. The Supreme Soviet of the North 
Ossetian SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] convened for an 
emergency session and presented an ultimatum: Remove the 
roadblocks and surrender the weapons. Otherwise it will be done 
by force. 
  Only the president could stop the swift movement towards the 
perilous cliff. Kostoyev passed all the documents to him through 
aides. But the president did not meet with him. 
  Finally, it looked as if he would have some luck. B.N. 
Yeltsin scheduled a meeting with his local representatives on 27 
October; Kostoyev sent a note: Disaster may strike any day; 
please, hear me out. He did not know yet that on that day the 
Supreme Soviet of North Ossetian SSR had approved a statute on 
the national guard and national volunteer corps. This was a 
gross violation of the Constitution, but nobody ever paid any 
attention to the Constitution in Russia. On that day the 
formation of an independent North Ossetian army was completed. 
An army is created in order to fight. The note was the only 
one--it was impossible to overlook it; still, no meeting took 
place. 
  A day later Khizha held a meeting in his office, but Georgiy 
Khizha, chairman of the North Caucasus Region Security Council, 
had only a very vague understanding of the subject of the 
conversation. To Khizha's credit, he rather quickly admitted it, 
and they agreed to meet the next day so that he could look into 
the history of the problem in more detail. Kostoyev showed up, 
but this meeting did not take place either. He was told that 
Khizha was ill. The next morning--a telephone call from Nazran. 
This was 31 October--the day declared by Vladikavkaz as the 
beginning of the Ingush aggression. 
  General Savvin, who was leaving for North Ossetia, gave 
Kostoyev a ride on his plane. Straight from Beslan airport 
Savvin sent him in a military helicopter to Nazran. It was 
there, in the evening, that Kostoyev learned that Khizha was in 
Vladikavkaz. 
<H5>  VLADIKAVKAZ, 31 OCTOBER 1992 </H5>
  Sergey Shoygu and Gennadiy Filatov arrived in Beslan in 
their 
aircraft late in the evening. Gaydar called Shoygu in the 
morning in Yekaterinburg, where the latter made a stopover on 
the way to Siberia, and asked him to immediately fly to 
Vladikavkaz. An armed conflict had flared up between Ossetians 
and Ingush, said the first deputy prime minister; the situation 
is complex, and the GKChS [State Committee for Emergency 
Situations] chairman should assist Deputy Prime Minister Khizha, 
who has already left for the region. Shoygu took with him his 
deputy, Colonel General Filatov. 
  An agitated crowd in the square in front of the Supreme 
Soviet building demanded alternately that the North Ossetian 
government resign and that the army corps interfere, but more 
than anything else they urged that military warehouses be seized 
so they could be armed. 
  All the local and visiting officials gathered in the office 
of Chairman A. Galazov. Galazov was briefing Khizha on the 
situation. From his report it followed that early in the morning 
the Ingush had attacked the Chermen post, disarmed a military 
unit, seized several APC's, and were moving in the direction of 
Vladikavkaz. Units of Ingush thugs, said Galazov, were well 
organized and armed. Serious fighting is going on in Chermen and 
other villages. During the day Galazov delivered an address on 
local television that alarmed the entire republic. He compared 
the current events with the beginning of the Great Patriotic 
War. Shoygu got the impression that very few had a grasp of the 
situation. There was a lot of confusion, and another thing that 
surprised him was that people straight from the street kept 
barging into the office--where the entire Ossetian leadership, a 
deputy prime minister of Russia, multistar generals that had 
flown in, and Minister of Security Bzayev himself were holding a 
meeting--yelling that their children had been killed, parents 
abducted and taken off, and old people thrown out of their homes. 
  "Georgiy Stepanovich," Galazov was persuading Khizha, "you 
can see for yourself--unless we distribute arms, we will be 
smashed." 
  Khetagurov, chairman of the North Ossetian Council of 
Ministers, supported Galazov and said that at least 15,000 
submachine guns should be issued to arm the people. It would 
come out later that Ossetians had taken hostage the wife and 
daughter of the corps chief of staff, Major General Skobelev. 
  Now Galazov and Khetagurov were directly demanding 
armaments. 
We, Ossetians, are getting killed, they were saying, while you 
are sitting here thinking about whether to give people arms or 
not. 
  On Khizha's order, upon telephone approval by Grachev and 
Gaydar, that same night 642 units of firearms were delivered to 
military draft offices and distributed: submachine guns, machine 
guns, grenade launchers, and ammunition for them. In addition, 
18 infantry fighting vehicles (IFV) were also made available. 
  Khetagurov still was not satisfied. Sergey Shoygu issued 
ammunition to meet the needs of the North Ossetian MVD, but that 
was not enough--on his orders he also put at their disposal 57 
heavy T-72 tanks. He "recalled" this only when confronted during 
the investigation with his letter to a military unit commander. 
"Somebody had to take responsibility; I had the guts to do it. 
They were manned by military crews," Shoygu explained. 
  Yes, the crews were rented out. Residents of Ingush villages 
would see their houses smashed by Russian tanks, driven by 
Russians. 
  Meanwhile, the fluctuations in the behavior of the crowd in 
front of the Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers building, 
which alternately quieted down and became agitated, were far 
from random. It was Colonel General Savvin's observation that 
this was organized by someone on purpose, in order to exert 
pressure. 
  Another crowd, led by a procuracy officer who appeared out 
of 
nowhere, besieged the training center of the military school in 
Komgaron; six officers were seized and threatened with 
execution, after which the attackers' demands were met. They 
forgot, however, to warn the cadets guarding the arms. The 
cadets fired warning shots in the air, and when they ran out of 
ammunition, the crowd tore into pieces two boys who had only 
been in school for half a year. A report was released to the 
press that this was Ingush' doing. IZVESTIYA later had to run an 
apology. 
<H5>  FROM THE IZVESTIYA FILE </H5>
  In the fall of 1991 the Prigorodnyy Rayon Administration for 
Agriculture purchased 21 BRDM-2 [armored reconnaissance and 
patrol vehicle] equipped with night vision devices, radio 
transmitters, and filtration and ventilation systems. 
  On 9 June 1992 in Vladikavkaz, 12 self-propelled artillery 
systems (SAU 2S 1) of 122-mm caliber were seized. 
  On 10 June, a central artillery base was seized, from which 
14 KaMAZ trucks with ammunition and more than 14 units of 
firearms were stolen. The attack was led by O. Teziyev, chairman 
of the South Ossetian Council of Ministers. No legal proceedings 
against him have been initiated. 
  According to unconfirmed data, on the eve of the armed 
conflict a train carrying 24 units of APC-80 with full 
complement of armaments arrived; the recipient--the North 
Ossetian MVD. 
  According to military counterintelligence data, as of 4 
November 1992 the following arms had been stolen: one BRDM, one 
85-mm artillery gun, two IFV guns, 307 submachine guns, 788 
pistols, 15 machine guns, 93 carbines, and a great quantity of 
ammunition. 
  According to the data of North Ossetian official organs, the 
North Ossetian MVD in October 1992 had at its disposal: 1,065 
submachine guns, 304 Stechkin automatic pistols, 113 CPG-9 
antitank grenade-launchers, 11 antimissile defense systems, 68 
large-caliber machine guns, 36 armored personnel vehicles, and 
1,016 grenades. 
  According to the data of North Ossetian official organs, the 
national guard and the people's volunteer corps had at their 
disposal 826 submachine guns, 23 machine guns and grenade 
launchers, 53 units of APC-80, and four units of IFV's. (We 
assume that the official data are understated.) 
  *** 
  R.Z. Gelikhanova, attorney (former address: 20 
Shmulevich Street, Apt. 27, Vladikavkaz; currently lives in 
Nazran): 
  On 30 October there was a seminar at the Ministry of 
Justice. 
It went as usual. I went to the Leninskiy Rayon OVD. I was 
amazed to see sand bags piled up along the entire corridor and 
the assembly hall located across it. To my question as what it 
was, an OVD officer replied: "We are going to defend ourselves 
against the Ingush." I was at the OVD between 1200 and 1230. 
  On the morning of 31 October my husband and all my Ingush 
neighbors were taken somewhere, and about 1200, on the orders of 
Experimentmebel [Experimental Furniture] Director Dzutsev, my 
apartment was broken into and an OMON [Special Designation 
Militia Detachments] officer's family moved in. (Footnote 1) 
(About 17,000 Ingush lived in Vladikavkaz, working in the city's 
various offices and enterprises. 
  By the end of the day of 31 October, many of them had 
already 
been arrested; by the first days of November not a single family 
remained. Shaldon, an area of the city with a concentration of 
Ingush-owned family homes, had been burned to the ground; about 
600 state-owned apartments and all their contents were given to 
new tenants.) 
<H5>  NAZRAN, 31 OCTOBER 1992 </H5>
  By daylight the square in front of the administration 
building in Nazran was overflowing with people. Many men brought 
arms with them--some hunting, some military type. The price of a 
submachine gun at the Nazran city market that day went up from 
150,000 [rubles] to 400,000. 
  People had begun gathering late the night before, when the 
first messengers from Oktyabrskoye woke up their relatives. The 
previous day, 30 October, a young resident of Dachnyy, Yandiyev, 
was killed at a bus stop by a sniper shot from a roof, and in 
the evening firing on Ingush quarters began in Kambileyevka and 
Oktyabryskoye. The fire was from large-caliber machine guns and 
either mortars or some sort of missile systems. It appeared that 
the fire came from the roofs of multifamily apartment houses in 
the rayon center of Oktyabrskoye. 
  Crowds of Nazran residents and inhabitants of other Ingush 
towns and villages were brought to the square by one and the 
same question: They are killing us again; why? Youths were urged 
to go and settle the score with the Ossetian militia. But just 
as the republic itself was not yet a state, neither was the 
crowd in the square a military formation. Experienced people 
tried to stop the tidal wave, but nobody listened to them any 
longer. In Zhiguli cars, buses, and KaMAZ trucks the crowd 
rushed toward Chermen--the nearest village on the territory of 
North Ossetia. The Nazran militia closed the traffic-control 
barrier on the highway; somebody in a car smashed through the 
barrier, after which the militiamen, too, were carried away by 
the human stream. By the evening the news came: At the 
intersection leading to Chermen the crowd disarmed a patrol 
unit, seized six APC's, let the Russian soldiers go, and in the 
village proper engaged in a fight with the Ossetian militia; 
there were casualties on both sides. It was all there in Chermen 
on that horrible day: plundering, arson, and hostage-taking. 
  The Ingush finally did what they had long been pushed into 
doing--they took up arms. 
  Vladikavkaz television and North Ossetian newspapers 
reported: In the early morning of 31 October a column of 
well-armed Ingush commandos accompanied by armored vehicles 
crossed the border of sovereign North Ossetia near the village 
of Chermen and moved on to Vladikavkaz. Simultaneously, 
individual gang formations invaded Ossetian villages from the 
flanks. Thus began a preplanned perfidious Ingush aggression 
against the neighboring republic. 
  Telephone communications with Vladikavkaz were disrupted on 
31 October and restored only the next day. Kostoyev's telephone 
conversations with Khizha were full of confusion and as a rule 
ended with the deputy prime minister's ominous phrase: "We are 
quite serious!.." 
<H5>  FROM THE IZVESTIYA FILE </H5>
  According to official data, by the beginning of the 
conflict the Ingush side had at its disposal 176 submachine 
guns, seven machine guns, five grenade launchers, 90 antitank 
grenades, and 500 hand grenades. This data apparently does not 
take into account privately acquired firearms. 
  *** 
  Isa Yunusovich Buzurganov, former resident of 
Kambileyevka village (currently living in Nazran): 
  Even before the 30th, APC's began to canvass our streets, 
stopping by Ossetian homes and openly distributing arms. On the 
night of 30-31 October we fully realized the hopelessness of our 
situation. After 2200, a long siren sounded at the Kambileyevka 
chemical plant; alarm signals also sounded at other enterprises. 
That is when intensive firing on our houses began. The first 
shot came from an APC moving along Mayakovskiy Street in the 
direction of five-story apartment buildings. After a long burst 
of fire it disappeared; and then shooting started from all sides. 
  During the night, at about 0400, they started firing at us 
with grenade launchers from the direction of the veterinary 
clinic on Rechnaya Street; fire from automatic weapons went on 
continuously. The grenade launchers accomplished their task--our 
homes were in flames. 
  By the morning of 31 October, shortly after 0700, this hell 
subsided. By about 0900 a delegation arrived, headed by General 
Savvin's deputy--that is the way he introduced himself--and 
Sikoyev, North Ossetia's deputy minister of internal affairs, 
and Yakub Kushtov and Ruslan Tatiyev. They inspected the 
buildings demolished or damaged by shelling, and talked to the 
people. Sikoyev and the general began to apologize, saying that 
there would be no more shooting and the guilty ones would be 
punished. Precisely at this moment another round of firing 
began; Sikoyev became very nervous, rushed about, started 
calling somewhere, and shortly afterwards they departed, leaving 
us in complete uncertainty. 
  This was hardly a "delegation." Most likely, all four 
arrived 
from different directions: General I.I. Kapliyev, the deputy of 
[internal troops] commander V.N. Savvin; the commandant of 
Vladikavkaz, S.I. Sikoyev; Sunzhenskiy Rayon Soviet Chairman 
Ruslan Tatiyev; and member of Ingushetia's People's Council 
Yakub Kushtov. Many eyewitnesses to the events recall that a 
heated exchange ensued right there between Kapliyev and Sikoyev. 
  Strange as it seems, the events of that night were not 
reported in either the Ossetian or the central press, although 
eventually they surfaced in official materials--inaccessible to 
some, unrequested by others. A year later A. Shchukin, the chief 
of a composite investigative group, replied to an IZVESTIYA 
inquiry: There is such a version; we are working on it. Still 
working on it! Had it been worked on by the investigative group, 
A. Galazov would not be able to continue repeating to this day 
the canned version of preplanned aggression by Ingush 
national-extremists.

<H5>  2. THE ARSON </H5>
  The rapid development of the Ossetian-Ingush armed 
conflict resembled a tightly wound spring suddenly coming loose. 
Without the understanding who had wound this spring, and how, it 
is impossible to discern the pattern of interests 
behind this chain of events. Therefore, we have to apologize to 
the reader for a detour in the narrative and bring him back to 
the testimony and documents that will allow him on his own to 
find cause-and-effect connections between seemingly random 
events and the historic underpinnings under the continuing "cold 
war" between the two republics; we will begin with the testimony 
of Oktyabrskoye village resident Bashir Buzurtanov. There are 
hundreds of such, or similar, tales. 
  My, Bashir Buzurtanov's, family had lived in Sholkhi 
for generations. My grandfather and father are buried in Sholkhi 
(now Oktyabrskoye). When my father returned from exile, he was 
not permitted to settle in his native village. He had a dream of 
buying out his house, but the new owners refused. He died still 
carrying this heartache. In July 1990, in carrying out his will, 
I bought a house in Sholkhi; all of my father's savings went 
into this. And on 2 August, burning torches were thrown into my 
yard. These are sticks with a kerosene-soaked rag wrapped around 
one end. At the time, the house was still occupied by the 
Ossetian Dzanagov, who sold me the house; he was the one who 
extinguished the fire. The gloomy Dzanagovs begged me to take my 
money back; otherwise, Ossetian informals had promised to kill 
them for selling the house to an Ingush. The informals told them 
that there was some decree to this effect. I refused to take the 
money. On the same night, at 0200, the house was doused with 
kerosene and a torch was thrown in. My wife and I, together with 
the elderly Dzanagovs, put out the fire. Other neighbors wanted 
to help, but they were afraid of the bosses and the informals. 
Rural Soviet Chairman Totrov came, upbraided the Dzanagovs, and 
then talked to me. He advised me immediately to leave the 
territory of the NO ASSR [North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet 
Socialist Republic]. I went to Petr Dzhusoyev, the first 
secretary of the CPSU raykom [rayon committee]. He said that 
Ingush do not have the right to complain against Ossetians. He 
demanded that I leave the house that I had bought and settle in 
Nazran. 
  The Dzanagovs and the Buzurtanovs probably could get along 
after all, but the informals were correct: There had been a 
decree. And not even one--three. The first one during 
Khrushchev's thaw, when in order to correct "excesses of the 
personality cult," the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored. 
Anticipating a mass return of Ingush to their homeland, the NO 
ASSR Council of Ministers by a secret circular (No. 063) as 
early as in 1956 prohibited organizations and private 
individuals to sell houses or rent apartment space to Ingush. 
Nevertheless, Ingush still brought houses, got residence 
permits, and settled in. Naturally, not without some greasing of 
palms. The NO ASSR leadership, fearing that despite everything 
the Ingush would strike root in their former homeland, decided 
to close all the loopholes. It had always had access to the 
all-Union government, and in 1982 the USSR Council of Ministers 
issued a decree (No. 183) "On Limiting Issuance of Residence 
Permits in Prigorodnyy Rayon of the North Ossetian ASSR." This 
unclassified decree did not mention "persons of Ingush origin," 
but everybody knew to whom the limitation on issuance of 
residence permits applied. Nevertheless, Ingush continued to buy 
houses, build new ones, and pay bribes for this, albeit in 
greater amounts than before. Perestroyka and the democratic 
trends that developed in connection with it brought new distress 
to republic leaders, who were aware that, having set root, the 
Ingush would want to legalize their status--among other things 
so that they would not have to pay horrendous tributes. 
  In 1989 the Congress of USSR People's Deputies adopted a 
declaration "On Recognizing as Illegal and Criminal All Acts 
Against People Who Have Been Subjected to Forced Resettlement." 
A return of Prigorodnyy Rayon was not a too distant future. The 
declaration elicited a sharply negative reaction among both 
informals and the NO ASSR leadership. Former enemies joined 
ranks. University professor Galazov, who took an anti-Ingush 
position, became a secretary of the CPSU raykom, and then the 
republic leader. Under him the propaganda apparatus kicked in at 
full power and eventually implanted in society's consciousness a 
deeply negative attitude toward the Ingush as a people. He was 
unexpectedly helped by the disintegration of the communist 
ideology, with its decorative taboo on ethnic intolerance. This 
made the former leader of the Communist Party free to later 
speak of the Ingush people as a snake that had snuggled into the 
bosom of the Ossetian people. 
  On 14 September 1990, the NO ASSR Supreme Soviet adopted a 
third decree banning--this time on the territory of the entire 
republic--buying and selling of residential housing and other 
structures into private ownership. The protest of the procurator 
general of Russia was ignored. But in Moscow, RSFSR Supreme 
Soviet commissions already were at work, which found the Ingush 
population's demand to return Prigorodnyy Rayon in its pre-1944 
borders to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR to be well founded. Then it 
so happened that a fight over a vegetable garden broke out 
between Ossetians and Ingush in Kurtat village. On 19 April 1991 
a state of emergency was imposed not only in this village, but 
in the entire Prigorodnyy Rayon, as well as in Vladikavkaz. A 
week later, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet, under B.N. Yeltsin's 
leadership, almost unanimously did pass the law "On 
Rehabilitation of the Peoples Subjected to Repression," with 
Articles 3 and 6 envisaging the return of the old status to the 
territories. As Ossetians had feared, the impatient Ingush 
leaders immediately began to demand that the law be implemented 
and that the state of emergency be lifted. The Moscow 
authorities remained silent, as if they had forgotten about the 
just-adopted law. 
  The North Ossetian press filled up with articles justifying 
the deportation of Vaynakhs by Stalin. Zaur Dzarakhokhov, the 
chief of the North Ossetian MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] 
press center, mockingly suggested that the Ingush should 
announce a collection of money and erect in Nazran a monument to 
the father of all peoples, Stalin, for sending Ingush far away 
from the front lines and thus giving them the "opportunity to 
preserve the genetic stock of the nation." 
  It is of course the simplest explanation--that the 
anti-Ingush attitude of the Ossetian society is merely the 
result of massive government propaganda. While not diminishing 
at all the influence of the propaganda apparatus and the force 
of its impact, it should be noted that the inhabitants of North 
Ossetia, despite the 70-year-long uninterrupted tradition of 
trusting Soviet power, in the end would be able to separate 
obvious lies from the truth. On two conditions: that they would 
have an independent source of information and that there would 
not exist objective reasons for them to fear the Ingush. 
  One would assume that among such unconscious feelings, 
locked 
in the back of their mind, is an old guilt complex. The 
barbarity of Stalin and Beria was not only in mobilizing 3,000 
Ossetians--among many members of other ethnic groups in the 
Caucasus--to participate in driving out the neighboring people, 
but also in encouraging them, and sometimes even forcing them, 
to take over other peoples' homes, with beds still warm, food 
still on the stove, and unmilked cows in the barn. No matter how 
politicians and journalists may have exerted themselves later in 
trying to justify the deed, it is impossible to fool a healthy 
sense of morality among the people. The only thing that may 
lighten the burden is a reciprocal and greater fault of the 
neighbors. 
  But these are emotional-psychological reasons for fear. 
There 
are other, more conscious ones. The fertile lands of Prigorodnyy 
Rayon always fed Vladikavkaz and will continue feeding it, no 
matter who lives there--Ingush, Ossetians, or Russians. Such are 
the laws of economic geography. The density of population there, 
however, according to the republic statistics, is already 
high--127 persons per square kilometer--and will steadily 
increase through the natural growth of Ingush population (15.6 
per 1,000 of population, as compared to 6.4 among Ossetians). 
They even came up with a term for it--aggressive birth 
rate--which has replaced military aggression. Youth under the 
working age comprised 37.3 percent of the Ingush population 
(among Ossetians, 26.7 percent, respectively). Demographers say 
that no matter what, after a certain number of years, Ossetians 
will end up an ethnic minority in this region, and then the 
Ingush farm market in Vladikavkaz will become a political factor. 
  More than a year later, on 4 June 1992, the RSFSR Supreme 
Soviet made the following step--it adopted the law "On Forming 
the Ingush Republic as a Component of the Russian Federation." 
  What remained was to determine the republic borders and 
elect 
a parliament. V. Tishkov, the former chairman of the State 
Committee on Nationalities, was inclined to hold elections to 
the Ingush Republic parliament among other places on the 
territory of Prigorodnyy Rayon in North Ossetia, in the places 
of compact habitation of Ingush. The Ossetian representative 
flatly refused even to discuss this proposal. 
  On 26 October 1992, after a number of meetings of the 
presidium of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, where the 
Ossetian-Ingush--no, not a conflict yet--question was discussed, 
a proposal was made for a joint commission with the 
participation of Ossetian and Ingush representatives to draft a 
decision. For the Ossetian side to sit down at the negotiation 
table would mean to recognize the existence of the problem. To 
refuse to further participate in the discussion meant an open 
conflict with the government, the Supreme Soviet, and the 
president, who had signed the laws under dispute. For the 
Vladikavkaz leadership a diplomatic failure was fraught not only 
with the danger of losing their political face. A scandal 
replete with accusations of corruption was brewing in the 
republic parliament. A certain top official sent a daughter 
abroad; another was being linked to sales of valuable metals 
abroad and the vanished hard currency proceeds. A good shake-up 
could turn public opinion around. It is quite possible that by 
that time the Ossetian leadership had made a decision to get a 
decisive hold of Prigorodnyy Rayon at any cost. Now it was 
possible to achieve only by squeezing Ingush out of its 
boundaries and setting a strict military border between the two 
republics. 
  In this coagulated atmosphere of fear and mistrust toward 
one 
another, any torch thrown over a fence, any new street killing, 
held the danger of an explosion. Which is precisely what 
happened. 
<H3>  FROM THE IZVESTIYA FILE. What Kind of Legacy Do We Refuse To 
Reject? </H3>
  Top secret. 
  To the people's commissar for national security, 
Comrade L.P. Beria 
  I hereby report that loading of Chechens and Ingush due 
for resettlement began by 0500 on 23 February 1944. Altogether, 
accepted for convoy and dispatched were 180 trains, 65 railcars 
in each, carrying a total of 493,269 resettlers. On average 
2,740 persons per train. Travel time by train is between nine 
and 23 days--16 days on average. While on route, 56 persons were 
born, 285 delivered to medical facilities for treatment, and 
1,272 died.... 
  [Signed] Chief of the convoy troops of the USSR NKVD 
[People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs], Major General 
(Bochkov) 
  State Defense Committee 
  To Comrade I.V. Stalin 
  26 February 1944 
  In connection with the resettlement of Chechens and 
Ingush..., to transfer to: 
  ....North Ossetian ASSR--Achalukskiy, Nazranovskiy, and 
Psedakhskiy Rayons within their existing borders, as well as 
Prigorodnyy Rayon, with the exception of its southern 
high-altitude part, and a part of Sunzhenskiy Rayon. 
  ....The initial plan was to transfer two 
rayons--Psedakhskiy and Malgobekskiy--to the Kabardino-Balkar 
ASSR. However, it was found expedient to transfer Psedakhskiy 
Rayon to North Ossetia, especially considering that after the 
planned resettlement of Balkars, who occupy the territory of 
about 500,000 hectares, Kabardins will get the vacated 
lands. 
  [Signed] L. Beria 
  Later on, as it follows from the Supreme Soviet presidium's 
decree "On Liquidating the Chechen-Ingush ASSR...." dated 7 
March 1944, it was found expedient also to transfer both 
Psedakhskiy and Malgobekskiy Rayons to North Ossetia, and on top 
of that, to grant the request of the Soviet of People's 
Commissars and the VKP(b) [All-Union Communist (Bolshevik) 
party] oblast committee of this republic to transfer to it the 
city of Mozdok in Stavropol Kray, together with adjacent 
population centers, as well as Kurpskiy Rayon of 
Kabardino-Balkaria. "Thanks to continuous support of the 
bolshevik party and Comrade Stalin personally....the territory 
of our republic has increased by up to 50 percent," said the 
North Ossetian BKP(b) obkom's secretary, I.D. Kulov, in one of 
his reports. 
  From the decree of the presidium of the USSR Supreme 
Soviet (not to be published in the press) dated 16 July 1956 
  "Taking into account the fact that there is no further 
need to continue existing restrictions in the legal status of 
Chechens, Ingush, and Karachay and their family members 
currently residing in restricted settlement areas, the presidium 
of the USSR Supreme Soviet resolves: 1. To remove from 
restricted settlement records and free from under administrative 
oversight. 2. To stipulate that removal of restricted settlement 
provisions regarding the persons enumerated in Article 1 of this 
decree does not entail returning to them the property 
confiscated during the eviction, and that they do not have a 
right to return to locales from which they had been 
evicted." 
  Special file. Top secret. 
  From the memorandum of the Committee for State Security 
under the USSR Council of Ministers to the CPSU Central 
Committee, 1 April 1957 (No. 682-E). 
  In violation of the USSR Supreme Soviet presidium's 
decree dated 16 July 1956, individuals of Ingush origin formerly 
subject to restricted settlement provisions in unorganized 
manner and en masse have returned to old areas of habitation.... 
  In reporting the above, the Committee for State 
Security believes it expedient to instruct the RSFSR Council of 
Ministers to take urgent steps with respect to factors causing 
an unhealthy situation in North Ossetian ASSR. 
  [Signed] I. Serov, chairman of the Committee for State 
Security under the USSR Council of Ministers. 
  Undoubtedly, the KGB chief, concerned over exacerbation of 
the political situation in North Ossetia, could not fail to be 
aware of the fact that the ban on Chechens and Ingush returning 
to their homeland had been lifted three months prior to that. 
  On one and the same day (9 January 1957) and under an almost 
identical heading ("On the Restoration of the Chechen-Ingush 
ASSR...."), one expanding the other, two decrees--an all-Union 
and a Russian one--were issued that were in sharp conflict to 
each other. The first repeals as no longer in effect the decree 
"On Liquidating the Chechen-Ingush ASSR....", and hence restores 
the republic's borders as of February 1944. The second--the 
Russian--decree, in the list of rayons being returned to 
Chechen-Ingush Republic, does not mention Prigorodnyy Rayon, 
which makes the republic's restoration within the old borders 
impossible and return of the Ingush to their homeland quite 
questionable. 
  Issa Magomedovich Kostoyev, an experienced legal scholar, 
has 
shoveled through piles of paper in archives trying to find at 
least some serious--even by the standards of those 
times--legislative act formalizing Prigorodnyy Rayon as part of 
North Ossetia. He could not find anything! Moreover, until 1978, 
in the Chechen-Ingush Republic Constitution Prigorodnyy Rayon 
was listed as its component, and only after 1978 did North 
Ossetia include it in its Constitution. If we approach this 
matter from a strictly legal standpoint and take as the basis 
the only competent document in this entire chain of decrees--the 
decree "On the Restoration of Chechen-Ingush Republic," which 
repealed the repressive acts, Prigorodnyy Rayon all these years 
has been and remains a part of Ingushetia. Unless, of course, 
following the example of North Ossetia, we take as the sole 
basis the Stalin-Beria decree on the deportation of the 
population and the liquidation of the republic. 
  "The USSR Supreme Soviet declaration 'On Recognizing as 
Illegitimate and Criminal Repressive Acts Against Peoples 
Subjected to Forced Resettlement and Ensuring Their Rights,'" 
adopted with applause by the Congress of USSR People's Deputies 
on 14 November 1989, and the law "On Rehabilitation of the 
Peoples Subjected to Repression," dated 26 April 1991 and signed 
by the Chairman of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet B.N. 
Yeltsin, do not leave any doubt in this respect. They once and 
again unconditionally affirm that "all acts of all-Union, 
republic, and local organs with respect to peoples subjected to 
repressions, with the exception of the acts restoring their 
rights, shall be considered null and void." 
  Nevertheless, the fate of the new law "On 
Rehabilitation...." 
was dramatic; its first opponent was the CPSU leadership. 
  From the open letter of Idris Bazorkin, people's writer 
of Chechen-Ingushetia, a delegate of the First Congress of USSR 
writers, to the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee 
M.S. Gorbachev (June 1991): 
  I joined the party as a candidate in 1942, when the 
Germans were bombing the Groznyy oil fields. I was a military 
correspondent and believed in the power of the party. 
  I received my party membership card on 24 February 
1944. The last party membership card in the no-longer existing 
Chechen-Ingush Republic. On that day, my people had already been 
en route for a day, evicted from their own home, some of them 
executed on the spot. 
  Finally, on 26 April 1991, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet 
passed a law "On Rehabilitation of the Peoples Subjected to 
Repressions." This edict, aimed at blocking the RSFSR Law "On 
Rehabilitation of the Peoples Subjected to Repressions" and 
aimed at provoking interethnic conflicts, was the last straw. 
  I return to you my party membership card, since I 
consider it impossible for an honest man to be a member of the 
party of enemies of the people. 
  Idris Bazorkin, the most significant Ingush writer, lived to 
see the August of 1991; he lived through a revival of hope and 
another crash of it: The law "On Forming the Ingush Republic as 
a Component Part of the Russian Federation," signed by the 
Russian Federation president on 4 June 1992, proclaimed the new 
state entity on paper: without territory, without borders, 
without a capital, without administrative and economic 
structures and ties. It does mention "the interests of the 
Cossacks and the possibility of expanding their self-rule" and 
establishes a transition period until March 1994. The writer did 
not live that long. 
  On the second day of the Chechen-Ingush conflict, the 
82-year-old novelist was taken from his Vladikavkaz apartment; 
his entire family also found itself held hostage. Later, under 
public pressure, Bazorkin was let go to live in Nazran. The loss 
of his home and archives (the apartment is occupied, the fate of 
the archives is unknown), and most importantly, the tragedy of 
his people, undermined the writer's health--Idris Bazorkin died 
in the spring of 1993.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "While the Problems Are Becoming </F>
Worse in the Country the Reforms Are Headed in the Wrong 
Direction"] 
  [Text] We are completing publication of the program for 
extricating us from the crisis, which is meeting a hostile 
reception from the leadership and the press. 
  This work, which is still not being published, has given 
rise 
to such a storm of enmity that the last names of L. Abalkin, N. 
Petrakov and S. Shatalin are beginning to frighten the average 
citizen and they are being labelled in the spirit of the old 
agitprop practice. 
  "Without ceremony they are calling us enemies of the 
people," 
Stanislav Shatalin lamented bitterly. 
  If one reads the commentaries and listens to the television 
oracles, one gets the impression that a regular campaign like 
the Burbulis "RF-politics" is beginning: find the enemy, 
stigmatize him and destroy him. The aim of this outbreak of 
"political cholera" is to distract society from this serious, 
thoughtful and competent analysis of the reasons for the failure 
of the policies of "shock therapy" which we call monetarism, and 
to split the government and the regions into "ours" and "not 
ours," and the whole country into two camps who do not trust one 
another. To defame these competent, sober and 
democraticly-minded academicians and through them the 
Chernomyrdin-Soskovets government while it is trying to correct 
the course which failed. 
  In a word, they are ostracizing these three well-know 
academicians and aiming at those sober reformers in the 
government who reject the shock therapy against the people. 
This is evident to anyone who is acquainted with the 
handwriting of the masters of behind the scene deals. 
  That is how they broke up the team and perhaps God will 
judge 
them as a team. But we have decided to acquaint the broad 
reading public with almost the complete text of this serious, 
and in our view, promising work of the Economic Department of 
the Russian Academy of Sciences and the International "Reforma" 
Fund, having published its chapters in three issues of RT 
[RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA]. Let the readers themselves evaluate the 
views of the academicians, their analysis of the reforms, and 
their suggestions as to how to correct the fateful situation, 
led by monetarism to socio-economic absurdity, and in fact to a 
dead end. 
  We have singled out and are publishing with insignificant 
cuts this chapter from the comprehensive program "Socio-Economic 
Transformation in Russia: the Current Situation and New 
Approaches" (see page 3). We are doing this not only because 
the essence of the publication is organically intertwined with 
RT's policy of a newspaper of social protection, but also 
because we are talking here about material which can be 
understood by each person. 
  It is namely the social side of the reforms being carried 
out 
which the population of Russia has categorically rejected, and 
which is the reason for the crushing defeat of the "Russia's 
Choice" party at the recent parliamentary elections. In 
civilized countries such a party, having lost the elections, 
would either go away or else seriously correct its course. Our 
monetarists, counting themselves among the civilized, not only 
do not want to recognize the loss of the people's trust, but are 
trying to pin on others their fault for the country's 
impoverisment. 
  And it is namely this chapter of the program that is 
convincing: the welfare of working people and their social 
security has been thrown to the side of the road of the 
"reforms" of the stubborn and hard-headed monetarists.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker: "Russia on the Threshold of </F>
`Ukrainization'; Boris Fedorov Hopes That the President Will Not 
Forget About His Right To Dismiss the Cabinet"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Demarche </H5>
  Boris Yeltsin's edict on the appointment of Boris Fedorov, 
minister of finance, was declined by the latter. A day before 
this, Mr. Fedorov did not accept Viktor Chernomyrdin's official 
proposal to retain for himself the post of chief financier, with 
direct subordination to the prime minister and broadened powers 
at the expense of a cut in the functions of Aleksandr Shokhin 
(negotiations with the West on debts). It was not the lowering 
of his status as deputy prime minister as such that Boris 
Fedorov considered "insulting" to himself, but the background 
against which it occurred: the purely formal, from his 
standpoint, reorganization of the Cabinet of Ministers and the 
more and more apparent departure from the reform policy of 1993. 
"If the policy is being changed, evidently another minister of 
finance is needed," he said at a press conference. Commenting on 
Viktor Chernomyrdin's statement heard four hours earlier on the 
transition to "the fight against inflation through nonmonetary 
methods," Boris Fedorov said that he did not know what this was, 
implying by this a hopeless attempt to raise production through 
inflationary emissions. "Even given three times as many big 
infusions, production will fall in 1994 by 5 percent," he said. 
  Monetary emissions in the past year, according to Ministry 
of 
Finance calculations, amounted to 30-35 percent of all 
expenditures of the republic budget. Not one economy in the 
world had such a ratio. If this share is raised, which, 
apparently, the government and the Central Bank intend to do, 
then, according to the conviction of the ex-minister of finance, 
"we are on the threshold of Ukrainization." In this case the 
country, in the words of Boris Fedorov, "is being doomed to a 
pitiful existence." He noted though that in January-February of 
1994 the factors of a tough financial policy for the four last 
months of last year will still restrain the acceleration of 
inflation. However, as early as in March-April, "an explosion 
will occur." A monstrous increase in prices, a drop in the real 
incomes of the population, and an unavoidable breakdown in 
production will be the result for the year. "I was the minister 
of finance, and the country had a financial policy," said Boris 
Fedorov. "But where is our industrial and agrarian policy, and 
where were those who in their positions were responsible for 
them?" 
  The ex-minister proved to be true to himself in the 
straightforwardness of his political formulations, and he did 
not decline a personal assessment of the activity of the 
agrarian deputy prime minister, M. Zaveryukha, and the chief 
banker, Mr. Gerashchenko. He defined their role as "destructive" 
for reform. Boris Fedorov responded just as harshly to the 
statements of Professor Yasin and ex-ministers of the economy 
Saburov and Nechayev who claimed that allegedly in 1993 the 
ruble rate of exchange was held in check by monetary 
interventions on the stock exchange. Mr. Fedorov attributed 
these conclusions to the fact that the economists were poorly 
informed: "We supported the exchange rate of the dollar and not 
of the ruble, in order to preserve the effectiveness of our 
exports. He cited this fact as evidence: out of $4 billion given 
by the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank, the latter used 
only $1.5 billion at the auctions of the MMVB [Moscow Interbank 
Currency Exchange]. The report of the Ministry of Finance, 
"Russian Finances for 1993," according to the assurances of the 
ex-minister, will show the real economic policy and its results. 
  In this connection, the former deputy prime minister 
subjected Strobe Talbott--the second person in the hierarchy of 
the State Department of the United States and a personal friend 
of President Clinton--to sharp criticism. He called Mr. 
Talbott's recommendation--"less shock and more 
therapy"--inexpert. "In what did he see the shock?" asked Boris 
Fedorov. "In the fact that inflation was 20-30 percent, that in 
one year there was only a total of five bankrupt enterprises, 
and that the level of unemployment amounted to 1 percent of the 
number of those employed? We are moving to the market rather 
softly, and let Mr. Talbott cite another example." 
  The minister, who is resigning, sees the main danger 
precisely in the departure from a moderately tough policy. This, 
in his words, is even more regrettable, because "the time for 
radicalism in economic policy has ended, it is not necessary in 
1994 to make even one major radical decision." The main things 
have been done: favorable credits and import subsidies have been 
canceled, prices for bread and coal have been liberalized, and 
the refinancing rate of the Central Bank has practically become 
positive. The question now concerns only the creation and 
reinforcement of the market institutions. The time has arrived 
for professional and "conservative" work, according to Boris 
Fedorov's observation. He is not convinced that the current 
staff of the Cabinet of Ministers, a coalition in composition, 
conforms to these tasks. It reminds Mr. Fedorov "of something 
like Silayev's cabinet, where there was movement neither 
forward, nor backward." To the question concerning the prospects 
of Mr. Chernomyrdin's government, "resigner" Fedorov answered 
with meaning: "The president has the right to change the 
government. I hope that he will use it."

<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Kolokoltseva and Aleksandr Bekker: "Truth </F>
About Russian Finances"] 
  [Text] The report, "Russian Finances in 1993," prepared 
under the guidance of former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, 
essentially represents the first attempt at a comprehensive 
analysis of the state of Russia's financial policy last year 
from the standpoint of principles generally accepted in the 
civilized world. Analyzing Russia's monetary, credit, and budget 
policy, the authors of this work reach the conclusion that, on 
the whole, during 1993 it was possible to adhere to the 
"anti-inflationary direction of Russia's financial policy. A 
market economy exists in Russia and it can be regulated by 
market, that is, monetary, methods." They refute the view that 
the notorious policy of "shock" therapy was conducted in Russia. 
"By no criteria can a policy, under which the budget deficit 
comprising 10 percent of the GDP is financed through emission, 
the annual inflation is 900 percent, the population's monetary 
income and average wages in all sectors have grown more rapidly 
than prices, unemployment has remained at the level of 1 
percent, and there are no bankruptcies or enterprise closures, 
be shock therapy," the authors of this report think. Here, 
perhaps, it is appropriate to add that in 1993 Russian arbitral 
tribunals, nevertheless, registered eight cases of bankruptcies. 
However, in Russia there are 220,000 enterprises, of which about 
one-third are unprofitable. Thus, in Russia until now there has 
been neither shock, nor therapy. 
  The finance minister's report debunks a number of myths 
stemming "from the basic principle of socialism" about the 
primacy of production over the sphere of services and 
circulation. It lies in the fact that "at first it is necessary 
to raise production and to produce goods--and inflation itself 
will disappear." During the last one and a half years Mr. 
Gerashchenko has tried to convince the Russian and the 
international public that "Russian inflation is not of a 
monetary nature," but is due to the high degree of monopolism. 
However, it was demonstrated a long time ago that a strict 
dependence exists between the growth of the money supply and 
inflation rates and that the monetary factor accounts for 70 to 
75 percent of Russian inflation. Furthermore, thousands of 
enterprises have already adapted themselves to the market rules 
of the game and the experience of the last few years has 
demonstrated quite convincingly that under Russian conditions a 
selectively structural policy degenerates into ordinary emission 
pumping and the extortion of preferential credits and import 
subsidies by lobbyists, such as Messrs. Zaveryukha, Yefimov, 
Shurchkov, and Glukhikh. 
  The authors of this report quite appropriately cite 
ex-minister Fedorov's favorite quotation, which he got from 
Grigoriy Sokolnikov, author of the 1922-1924 monetary reform: 
"Emission is opium for the people." It is to be supposed that 
Mr. Sokolnikov's book, which was presented to Viktor 
Chernomyrdin with marked off places, as well as Ukraine's sad 
experience, has had some restraining effect on the government's 
distribution of unsecured subsidies. Now, however, after Boris 
Fedorov's departure from the Ministry of Finance, if Mr. 
Chernomyrdin wishes to follow the principal points of this book, 
he will have to confront the "red economic managers" almost 
alone. 
  The entire question is whether the prime minister, declaring 
his devotion to the policy of reform, but, at the same time, 
proposing that the economy be stabilized by "nonmonetary 
methods," is ready for this. It would not be bad for the prime 
minister's speech writer to find out what, as a rule, the fixing 
of the currency rate, price restriction, introduction of a 
100-percent sale of currency proceeds and of obligatory 
deliveries, and similar administrative pranks mean in economic 
practice.

<F P=106> [Deputy inquiry by Vasiliy Starodubtsev, as recorded by A. </F>
Golovenko: "Mr. Fedorov, Where Is the Peasants' Money?"] 
  [Text] The panicky and clumsy retreat of bankrupt 
monetarist Gaydar and his government team is being treated with 
a lot of pretense, almost provocatively. The former Minister of 
Finance B. Fedorov, too, played coy like a pretty maiden before 
leaving, presenting his ultimatums to the most "popularly 
elected president." 
  Yesterday the editors received an indignant telephone call 
from the Agrarian Union's chairman, Vasiliy Starodubtsev--to 
protect, as he put it, agrarians from incompetent attacks. 
  "Urban agrarians of the like of Chernichenko, Yemelyanov, 
and 
Tikhonov do not miss a single occasion to pour dirt on the 
kolkhoz-sovkhoz system which they praised in the past. This 
chorus of ill-wishers was joined by the falsetto of Minister of 
Finance Fedorov--a man nurtured by the regime. The mouth of this 
gentleman does not tire of the expression `the black hole,' by 
which he means our agriculture. This time he, as he banged the 
door, got as far as saying that in his opinion buying 
grain abroad is much more economical than producing it. 
  "I believe that this is not a slip of the tongue. This is 
the 
position of the Gaydar team, which had taken the course of 
making domestic industry and agriculture bankrupt. In my 
opinion, Mr. Former Minister never figured out that over past 
decades, thanks to various academicians-theoreticians, all vital 
problems of the state were being dealt with at the expense of 
agriculture. But while over the years of Soviet power the 
peasantry had at least some opportunity to develop, the policy 
of the current `democratic' government, including Fedorov 
himself, brought it to its knees. 
  "The crazy, inequitable exchange of agricultural output for 
equipment and fuels turned many flourishing farms into paupers, 
practically brought construction in the countryside to a halt, 
suspended modernization of agricultural machinery and use of 
mineral fertilizer. Having delivered the harvest to the state in 
July-August, kolkhozes and sovkhozes still have not received 
payment for it. So I want to ask Mr. Fedorov: Where is the 
peasants' money? People have been without pay for four to five 
months. Is it not clear that the current rate of inflation means 
free use of the results of peasants' labor by the state? 
  "Does the former minister not know that all Western 
countries 
conduct a protectionist policy with respect to agriculture, 
protect their producers? The share of subsidies in farmers' 
total expenditures reaches 50-60 percent; in our country, it is 
10 times less! Our consumers are charged R300 per loaf of bread, 
while grain is being procured from kolkhozes at R60 per 
kilogram. I want once again to ask Mr. Fedorov: Where is the 
R240 difference? In whose pocket does the people's money go? 
  "I will say without exaggeration and with figures in hand 
that our large socialist agriculture before `catastroyka' 
[turning into a catastrophe] used to be one of the most 
efficient in the world, and in some respects superior to that of 
the United States. Is this not why the inept reformers began to 
crush it with such zeal in order to please the Western farmer? 
The upcoming planting is in danger of failure: there is no fuel 
or fertilizer; there is not enough seed; equipment is not being 
repaired--no parts or tools! And these gentlemen still are 
talking about some agrarian lobby in the government! They leave 
it like rats from a sinking ship so that they will not have to 
answer to the economic collapse they have precipitated, and the 
impoverishment of urban and rural working people. 
  "Peasants do not have foreign currency accounts or dachas in 
California; their home is here, and they will do everything to 
survive and to feed the cities. But if, God forbid, famine does 
occur, the blame for it should be squarely placed at the feet of 
Mssrs. Gaydar, Fedorov, and other enemies of the Russian 
countryside."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Russia's Unfinished Reforms"] </F>
  [Text] The Centre for Economic and Political Studies (its 
Russian acronym being EPICentre) under the guidance of Grigory 
Yavlinsky has prepared its regular report entitled "The Economic 
Situation in 1992-1993" (the project's director is Alexei 
Mikhailov). 
  As seen by EPICentre's analysts, Russia's reforms have 
passed 
through three stages: 
  Stage I: January-May 1992, "Advance" 
  Stage II: June-December 1992, "Retreat" 
  Stage III: 1993, "Redeployment and New Advance" 
  Changes in the economic policy commenced at the close of 
1992 
and took final shape by the spring of 1993. December 1992 
witnessed the formation of a government headed by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. It was not so closeknit as the government of the 
second stage, but proved more capable of pursuing a purposeful 
economic policy. 
  In January it was announced that struggle against inflation 
was the key priority of the government's policy, its purpose 
being to lower the rate of inflation to 5 percent a month by the 
end of the year. For a number of reasons it became impossible to 
reach this aim despite a slowdown in the rate of inflation by 
the close of 1993. 
  From the beginning of the year payments from the budget were 
carried out with delays, which in the conditions of high 
inflation was tantamount to their reduction in real terms. In 
the third quarter, as declared by (Minister of Finance) Boris 
Fedorov, the deficit of the budget stood at 8.6 trillion rubles. 
For the results of the first nine months the total deficit of 
the budget almost reached a size approved by the president for 
the year. 
  In this situation a budgetary war broke out between the 
Ministry of Finance and the parliament which passed a law 
establishing the deficit at the level of 22.4 trillion rubles 
(15 percent of the GNP). The president returned it to parliament 
with a proposal to cut it to 13.5 trillion (9 percent of the 
GNP). 
  The parliament accepted those amendments which did not lead 
to a sharp reduction of expenditures, so the president said that 
he would not sign this kind of budget. The situation kept 
"hanging" in this state until September 21. 
  Official data on the Central Bank's credits to commercial 
banks vary, yet the tendency is clear: in the course of nine 
months the government and the Central Bank of Russia managed to 
secure a persistent and appreciable (on an average monthly 
basis) deceleration in the growth rates of centralized credit 
emission. 
  Moreover, noninflationary sources for financing the deficit 
of the budget, above all foreign credits, were found and put to 
successful use. There were two reasons explaining why in the 
pursuit of this policy it became impossible to check the growth 
of the money mass: the reduction of the surplus cash reserves of 
the economic subjects and the acceleration of money circulation. 
  The credit emission of commercial banks, which compensated 
the reduction of centralized credits, markedly intensified in 
1993. Moreover, in the structure of the money mass in 1992-1993 
there was a sharp growth in its most liquid part -- the funds on 
the bank accounts of enterprises and ready money (which, among 
other things, bears witness to a strengthening in the positions 
of the economy's shadow sector evading taxes and not mirrored in 
statistics). 
  Serious changes have occurred in Russia's foreign trade. In 
1993 the volume of export nearly doubled that of import. 
However, a positive balance was reached on account of the fact 
that there was a considerable reduction of import attended by a 
slight growth of export. Moreover, the increase in the physical 
volumes of export takes place in the conditions of a fall in the 
production of export goods inside the country. 
  During the first seven months of 1993 the funds of 
enterprises on foreign currency accounts in Russia increased by 
a mere 0.8 billion dollars (to reach 7.5 billion dollars by the 
end of August) whereas the funds legally lodged on short-term 
deposits in commercial banks abroad increased by ten billion 
dollars and by the end of the year (as estimated) had to reach 
the sum of about 20 billion. 
  During two years -- from October 29, 1991, to October 29, 
1993 -- the real rate of the dollar in Russia (related to the 
index of consumer prices) fell 16.4-fold. "Dollar inflation" 
became strongly pronounced especially beginning with July 1993 
in connection with the artificial stabilization of the nominal 
rate of the dollar to the ruble. 
  As a result many Russian sectors have proved to be 
noncompetitive on the domestic market (motor-car construction, 
radioelectronics), and the government has recourse of protection 
measures relative to the tariff regulation of the import of 
similar goods. On the other hand, the importers' earnings are 
being depreciated. Russia has got caught in serious dependence 
on credits from international financial organizations on whose 
account this rate is being maintained. 
  Russia is a country of unfinished system reforms. In 
industry 
there has been a virtual collectivization of property at 
enterprises in the past two years whereas in agriculture the 
movement of private peasant farmers has not yet risen to its 
feet. 
  In these two past years industrial output has fallen by a 
third, yet the slump was not structural but general in 
character. The toughening of the monetary policy has taken place 
on account of depressing the demand for investments. 
  Labor productivity keeps sharply falling in connection with 
the impossibility of dismissing workers (a consequence of 
collective ownership). This generated additional pressure from 
the inflation of costs and amounts to a corollary of the 
government's formal approach towards reforms.

"Assessing Gaydar -- Contemplating Chernomyrdin"] 
  [Text] Will the policy of reforms change after the 
resignation of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov? And if it does, 
then how? These and other questions are examined by MN's [MOSCOW 
NEWS] guests -- Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Parliamentary 
Committee on the Budget and Finances; Vasily Selyunin, 
economist, deputy of the State Duma; and Mark Massarsky, 
entrepreneur. 
<H5>  Diagnosis </H5>
  Vasily Selyunin: 
  "A change of course is not on the horizon for us -- it 
already occurred this January." 
  Mark Massarsky: 
  "Liberal democracy has suffered a historical defeat in 
Russia." 
  Mikhail Zadornov: 
  "The change of course took place a long time ago. Today 
it has simply become clear and obvious to everyone. When secrets 
are unveiled, I believe, it is a blessing." 
  Selyunin: The policy of reform was associated with 
the names of Gaydar and Fedorov. With their departure 
Chernomyrdin will be able to pursue a pro-inflationary policy 
which was resisted by the two reformists. Several economic 
decisions are enough to unwind inflation. The government has 
declared some of its intentions. One of them is the unification 
of the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. It has been 
estimated that it will increase the inflation rate in Russia by 
10 percent. Another decision is to allot 500 million dollars for 
the construction of a new parliament building. I have dealt with 
the economics of construction all my life, and I do not remember 
a single case of a construction project being consistent with 
the original estimate. A normal increase in the cost is between 
three and four times. This means that we are ready to invest in 
the construction of the parliament building as much as we spent 
last year on all the programs of conversion. 
  But the point is not in this alone. Beginning February 1, 
there is a plan to raise the wages and salaries of those 
employed in the budgetary sphere by 90 percent. As well as the 
expenditures on the newly-elected Federal Assembly. The experts 
of the Russia's Choice bloc have estimated that this amounts to 
15 million rubles per deputy a month. 
  What is the threat here? Already in the first quarter of 
January inflation was as high as 10 percent, meaning that it 
will reach 33 percent by the end of the month. If it keeps up 
this pace throughout the year, prices will grow 31-fold! 
  Massarsky: It looks as if this government will 
intervene even more strongly in the economy, and the end result 
will be the destruction of reforms. A healthy dislike of any 
government is an indicator of my liberalism. But I dislike the 
new government even more strongly than the old one. 
  Zadornov: If we speak about the economy, the 
attempt at classical macrostabilization lasted through the first 
three months of 1992. At that time Gaydar came to understand 
that their attempts had miserably failed. Gaydar was faced with 
an option: either to admit that his idea had proved untenable 
and step aside or to use his name as a screen for a totally 
different kind of policy. He opted for the second road. From 
that moment on, the Gaydar team busied itself not with economic 
problems but with an entirely different one; how to preserve 
themselves at the helm of power. 
<H5>  Case History </H5>
  Vasily Selyunin: 
  "After the Supreme Soviet had been dismissed, the 
government began pursuing an austere financial policy, with the 
result that the budget deficit rose to 7 percent and inflation 
to 12 percent a month." 
  Mark Massarsky: 
  "The government of reformers has dealt a crushing blow 
at the non-state economy." 
  Mikhail Zadornov: 
  "Since May 1992 Gaydar and his government have been 
pursuing a pro-inflationary policy." 
  Selyunin: Let us remember what turn of development 
has taken place in the last months of 1993. The Supreme Soviet 
drafted a budget with a large deficit. In defiance of 
everything, even the law, Minister of Finance Fedorov refused to 
fulfil it. The handing out of preferential credits was 
practically discontinued at the same time. Subsidies for import 
(they absorbed up to 12 percent of the GNP), i.e., the 
possibility to buy dollars not at the exchange, but for a song, 
were sharply limited, and they were left merely to purchase 
medicines and medical equipment. Measures were taken to 
liberalize foreign trade. Though not the best, a 
non-inflationary solution was found even in the situation with 
miners. Part of the diamonds were sold and a fund for the 
development of the fuel-and-energy complex was created on 
account of increasing the value-added tax. The reckless 
subsidizing of the CIS countries was brought to an end. As a 
result, we received 12 percent of inflation in December against 
26 percent in August. 
  Massarsky: I would not overdramatize Gaydar's 
departure and key up Shakespearean passions. The government of 
reformers has not coped with the task of macroeconomic 
regulation. As it has turned out, the Russian economy is 
inadequate in its responses to classical ploys. A simple 
example: to the compression of the money mass it reacts with a 
reduction of the volumes of output, not with a lowering of 
prices as is written in manuals. the result was the destruction 
of production -- a fact which Gaydar and Fedorov, according to 
their own words, are not inclined to dramatize. I, for my part, 
will permit myself to make the following analogy. The Western 
economy may be likened to a tropical forest: you chop down a 
tree in the morning and there are already green sprouts in the 
same place in the evening. But our Russian economy looks more 
like the tundra: nothing will grow for 50 years on a trail left 
by a cross-country vehicle. 
  But the point is not even in the economic results as such. 
The reformers have lost because the social basis of reforms has 
shrunk as a result of their actions. A crushing blow has been 
dealt to the non-state sector of the economy. Between 1989 and 
1990 the cooperative sector of the economy grew to seven million 
persons and became the only dynamic sector where current assets 
amounted to main capital. The so-called liberalization of prices 
has practically wiped out these assets. Conversely, in the state 
sector there has been an indexation of fixed and current assets, 
attended by the mutual account of nonpayments. All this has 
sharply strengthened the noncompetitive state sector. 
  Not to mention the taxation policy with which the reformers 
have been destroying us. With such taxes -- and in some cases 
their sum-total comes to 85 percent today -- it is impossible to 
have reproduction not only on a simple but even on an enlarged 
scale. 
  Why are the reformers being thanked so much by the 
commercial 
banks, street traders evading taxes and the comprador 
bourgeoisie taking unreplenishable raw materials out of Russia? 
Objectively, irrespective of its good liberal-democratic 
intentions, the government of reformers has expressed the 
interests of the comprador bourgeoisie, speculative capital and 
officials who, like hotel prostitutes, take bribes solely in 
foreign currency. The world has not known and, I hope, will not 
know bribe-takers like the ones who have been spawned by the 
government of reformers. 
  Zadornov: This "absence of policy" was continued 
throughout the whole of 1993. It had no clearly expressed 
guideposts and was internally contradictory, whereas the 
government was divided into groups which lobbied the interests 
of definite strata. The only person who expressed opposition to 
this policy was Boris Fedorov, who alone consistently resisted 
pro-inflationary solutions. Let us put it bluntly that he did 
that not quite correctly and quite often did not fulfil even 
presidential decrees. But let us cherish no illusions, for it is 
not Fedorov who shaped up policy. As a result, both Fedorov and 
Gaydar acted as a screen for by no means a liberal economic 
policy. 
<H5>  Forecast </H5>
  Vasily Selyunin: 
  "By spring Chernomyrdin will have been fired -- this 
will be a result of his own policy." 
  Mark Massarsky: 
  "I expect nothing good of the new government -- things 
will grow even worse." 
  Mikhail Zadornov: 
  "It is pointless, I believe, to speak about the 
economic reform in the immediate future." 
  Selyunin: The more Chernomyrdin vows fidelity to 
reforms, the more doubts this arouses. The Persians have a 
saying: "You said -- I believed, you repeated -- I doubted, you 
started insisting -- I came to understand that you were lying." 
The premier and, it seems, the president have drawn the 
following conclusion from the election returns: the pace of 
reforms must be slowed down, weak enterprises must be kept 
afloat, and unemployment must be resisted. However, they tend to 
forget that this entire "softening" will bring about a splash of 
inflation. But what people fear most of all is the growth of 
prices. 
  Gaydar's opponents say: "We must stimulate production." But 
the floating of money stimulates production growth only to a 
certain extent. Very quickly inflation acquires such a scale 
that money discontinues working in general. We have witnessed 
this situation in Ukraine where inflation is already comparable 
with that of war-torn Serbia. God forbid that we take the 
Ukrainian road. I believe that already by spring things may 
reach the point of an all-Russia strike. The government will 
resign. 
  Massarsky: On an even larger scale the government 
will begin feeding noncompetitive production units -- collective 
and state farms, the military-industrial complex, loss-making 
mines, and so on. By destroying competition it will destroy the 
rudiments of the market. 
  Zadornov: Large centralized credits will be 
allotted in the immediate future, for decisions to this effect 
have already been drafted. A steep spiral of inflation is 
assured. And it is important to note the following: the new 
government will be able to draw on the left-wing parliamentary 
majority. But the situation is even more dramatic. Upon the 
constitution's implementation, real power will be concentrated 
in the president's hands. Will the president find the strength 
and desire to be a more radical reformer than the government and 
the parliamentary majority? This question remains unanswered. 
  Massarsky: If the president joins hands with the 
Left on the principle of the state being the be-all and end-all 
(and, judging by his followers' statements, this is possible), 
the priorities of civic society will be consigned to oblivion. 
Pride of place will again be given not to man, but to the state. 
This will have its imprint not only on policy, but on the 
economy, too. I am still an optimist though. I believe that we 
will be saved by polycentrism. After all, there still exists the 
parliamentary democratic opposition. There is the fracturing of 
interests in the structure of the executive branch itself: the 
government is already turning into a definite counterbalance to 
presidential structures. And, last but not least, there exists 
the fourth branch as well.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Volkov: "Oleg Soskovets Will </F>
`Abalkinize' the Economy"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of next week scientists from 10 
scientific institutes will present an analytic report with 
proposals for the correction of the economic course to Russia's 
president and prime minister. Leonid Abalkin, one of the 
drafters of this report, informed Interfax of this. 
  For some time the report has been under the consideration of 
First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, who, judging by 
everything, intends to support it as an alternative to the 
government program approved in the summer of last year. It is 
quite probable that precisely this document will become the 
basis for the government program, which an expanded government 
meeting may adopt during the first 10-day period in February. 
  In contrast to the strategic guidelines approved by the big 
Council of Ministers in August 1993, the document worked out by 
Leonid Abalkin, Nikolay Petrakov, and other academicians, in 
fact, provides for a departure from the anti-inflationary policy 
and proposes that state regulation in the economy be restored in 
quite a large volume. It asserts that the "negative tendencies 
in large measure are rooted in the failures of the policy of 
financial stabilization." The authors of this report state that 
it is impossible to wage a fight against inflation by "purely 
monetaristic methods," while a restriction of the money supply 
and a reduction of the budget deficit "deprive the national 
economy of the possibility of making efficient structural 
changes." "Gaydar's and Fedorov's course has failed," Leonid 
Abalkin declared yesterday. 
  However, the measures proposed in the report, essentially, 
do 
not represent anything new. They were realized in practice 
through the pressure of enterprise directors during the 
pre-reform period and, to a somewhat lesser extent, under 
Messrs. Gaydar and Fedorov. The authors of this report again, as 
during the 1980's, put forward the thesis about the need "to 
restore the production volume" through the "conversion of the 
defense industry." 
  As a top-priority measure the report proposes the 
establishment of "price ratios and sectorial profitability 
levels efficient for our conditions." In practice, this can mean 
a departure from price liberalization and the application of 
methods of administrative regulation in production. 
  "In a number of cases financial adaptation--preferential 
taxation and the extension of special credit for consumers of 
products--can help industries, which at present are 
noncompetitive owing to high prices," the report states. In 
other words, Messrs. academicians propose that credit 
injections, which take place anyway, be expanded in order to 
stabilize the financial position of large Soviet enterprises in 
the hope that they would consciously make their production more 
efficient, or without this hope, automatically identifying 
competitiveness with the absence of competitors and preferential 
conditions of existence. 
  As it seems, such an approach exhausts the methods of 
"nonmonetary" effect on the economy and of fighting against 
inflation by "increasing effective demand." In order to expand 
the latter, the repeatedly expressed idea of indexing the 
population's savings to compensate for the price increase is 
proposed. This measure was actively lobbied in the former 
Supreme Soviet and was the main argument of Vladimir 
Ispravnikov, who appeared there in the role of Yegor Gaydar's 
opponent and after the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet 
switched over to the government apparatus. Its populist nature 
is all the more obvious, because the authors of this report 
propose that indexed funds be "pulled away" from the consumer 
market, evidently, by freezing deposits in banks. Thus, it is 
proposed that, in fact, credit emission be carried out, not 
granting additional real capital to the population, but, on the 
other hand, increasing the inflationary tax. 
  The authors of this report made an interesting statement on 
its first page: "Economies of different countries are 
different." Obviously, this banality would not deserve a place 
in the academic development of the strategy of the economic 
course for Russia if not for the subtext, which is an antonym of 
the famous Russian proverb, "What is good for the German is 
death for the Russian." Undoubtedly, the approach to the 
"correction of reforms" developed by Messrs. Abalkin, Petrakov, 
and so forth, has all the chances to be supported by "commodity 
producers," whose interests, apparently, will be observed by the 
government of Viktor Chernomyrdin and Oleg Soskovets. Such an 
approach makes it possible to refrain for some time from the 
production of the very commodity that consumers would like to 
purchase owing to its consumer properties, not in view of the 
lack of other goods. The promised "selective" credits issued on 
the expectation of the "consciousness" of Soviet managers can 
save time for "commodity producers." At the same time, this 
approach flatters the sense of national exclusiveness, rejecting 
well-known world experience and referring to world practice not 
known outside the narrow academic circle. 
  It can be assumed that, if this strategic document is 
accepted for execution and practical elaboration, real economic 
reforms will have a chance for continuation only to the extent 
that the government is incapable of pursuing its course in 
practice. However, if it seriously begins to act according to an 
academic scenario, the consequences will not be slow in making 
themselves felt and will force the political leadership to 
replace theoreticians with excessive initiative.

SovEcon: "Production Falling, Inflation Jumping by Leaps and 
Bounds"] 
  [Text] However paradoxical it may be, the task of combating 
inflation with purely credit-monetary means is doomed to produce 
face-lifting and short-lived effect. 
<H6>  Results-93 </H6>
  Recession had somewhat slowed down, yet continued in 
every sphere of the economy. As a rule, Russian statistics 
are correlated on economic indicators not with some basic level, 
but with the corresponding month or period of the previous year. 
Given this approach, the scope of the recession is being sort of 
"toned down", whereas the relative constancy of economic 
indicators from month to month creates the illusion of 
production being stabilized. In fact, however, this constancy 
merely testifies to the stabilization of the rates of recession, 
not the stabilization of output. This becomes obvious if the 
most important economic indicators of recent years are compared 
with the corresponding figures of 1990. 
  Although between 1990 and 1993 recession in all of Russia's 
main spheres of production was somewhat less than in the other 
CIS countries, it was rather significant on the whole: during 
this period industrial output declined by more than two-fifths 
and the sphere of services -- by one-third. Moreover, despite 
the avalanche-like recession in 1991 and 1992, for the third 
year running the reduction of the GDP and the volumes of 
industrial output in Russia has been expressed in a two-digit 
figure. 
  The slowing down of the rates of production decline, 
however, 
testifies, we believe, not so much to the signs of coming 
stabilization as to the depletion of the "potential" of 
recession as a result of the ongoing "shrinkage" of the initial 
basis. 
  In other words, the reduction of the volumes of production 
in 
itself predetermines a slowing down of the rates of recession, 
which by no means amounts to an indicator of its early 
discontinuation with the subsequent change of the vectors of 
movement. 
<H6>  Forecasts-94 </H6>
  The rates of recession will slow down, but the fall of 
production will continue. This is conditioned by the steady 
lowering of the share of gross investments in Russia's GDP. 
According to preliminary estimates, in 1993 it comprised a mere 
12-13%. The uncompensated removal of production 
capacities is 
acquiring a frontal character, that is to say, not only obsolete 
capacities are being removed, but even the possibilities are 
being undermined for the future growth of production in sectors 
which determine the economy's structure the greatest. 
  This structure in itself is becoming increasingly bulky and 
inert to the processes of renewal. From 1991 to 1993 the 
specific share of the fuel and energy sector increased from 11.3 
to 25.4% and that of ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy 
-- from 
11.2 to 18.6%, whereas the specific position of machine 
building ad metal working lowered from 25 to 20.5% and 
that of 
the light and food industry -- from 32.2 to 17.7%. 
Moreover, 
the mechanism of sanitizing enterprises and carrying out 
bankruptcies, which is one of the most effective means of 
improving the economy, has still not been put in operation. 
  On the other hand, the possibilities of halting the decline 
of investment activities in 1994 will be rigidly restricted due 
to the failure of the budgetary policy in 1993. A hole in the 
budget to the tune of five trillion rubles which "unexpectedly" 
appeared in the fourth quarter of 1993 determines the further 
reduction of budgetary investments (estimated in permanent 
prices) until at least the middle of 1994. However, if the high 
rates of inflation have been kept alive, the uncentralized 
investments of enterprises and private structure will continue 
to remain at a low level. As a result, in annual terms gross 
investments will diminish by another 10% in 1994. 
  It is highly probable that in 1994 the list of 
recession-gripped production units will increase in virtue of a 
decline in demand and its reorientation to similar but more 
competitive imported products. This primarily concerns the 
output of cars and color TV sets, the production of which 
somewhat increased in 1993. A similar situation already existed 
with the production of VCRs whose production increased by 
40% 
in 1992 but fell by 38% in 1993. As a result, the process 
of 
redirecting defense industry enterprises to expanding the 
production of sophisticated consumer goods may scale down, 
whereas conversion as a whole in the next few years will not be 
able to become one of the sources for boosting industrial output. 
  True, some growth in housing construction (up by 5%) 
makes 
it possible to hope that the volumes of the production of 
several building materials (bricks, glass, linoleum, 
bathroom-and-lavatory equipment) will either be preserved or 
register a very insignificant decline. On the whole, industrial 
output may lower by about 10-12% in 1994. 
  The dynamics of agricultural production will be affected by 
the reduction in 1993 of the areas under winter crops which 
comprised roughly 20% in comparison with the previous 
year. All 
other conditions being equal, this may entail a fall of grain 
production in 1994 within the limits of 6-8%. In 
cattle-breeding a stabilization of production may be expected in 
1994 in connection with a rise in the productivity of 
agricultural animals. Much, however, will depend on the level of 
grain production. If its lowering reaches 10%, it will 
hardly 
be possible to even hope for the maintaining of 1993 volumes. 
  The lowering in the main sphere of material production may 
have the result that in 1994 the GDP will be reduced by 
7-9% 
whereas inflation will hardly be lowered to the promised 
3-5% 
by the close of the year. 
  In the transitional-type economy the monetary means of 
management may temporarily dampen but not vanquish 
inflation. However paradoxical, but the task of combating 
inflation with purely credit-monetary means is doomed to produce 
face-lifting and short-lived effect. The point is that in a 
monopolized economy the monetarist policy in itself initiates 
stagflationist phenomena. Thus, the monopoly positions of 
enterprises easily make it possible to translate the increase of 
the interest rate into a growth of prices. 
  Enterprises respond to the compression of the money mass 
primarily with reducing the volumes of output, not by lowering 
prices. Moreover, the steadily lowering supply is becoming one 
of the permanent factors keeping the prices up. As a result, 
inflation acquires an increasingly inert character inasmuch as 
all the economic agents learn to indexate prices (overtly or 
covertly). All of this necessitates taking a rather sceptical 
look at the government's promises to lower the rates of 
inflation to 3% a month by December 1994. 
  In principle it is possible only to bring it down 
temporarily 
to this level. But this does not mean at all that already in the 
next month inflation will not again jump to a two-digit figure 
or that there will be no avalanche-like stoppage of production. 
In other words, pinning hopes exclusively or mainly on the 
credit-monetary levers of regulation given the weakness of 
structural-institutional changes may have the result that 
inflation will acquire a "jumping" character. 
  And it is as yet far from obvious which of the evils is the 
greatest for the economy: the high but slowly lowering rates of 
inflation or the rates of inflation which are quickly changing 
in the course of a short period of time. Judging by the 
government's statement on the economic policy in late 1993 and 
in 1994, the latter variant is highly probable in the year that 
has just begun.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker: "Taxes Raised on Enterprises </F>
and Banks. Fiscal Policy Does Not Extend to Capital Investments"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Edicts. </H5>
  By an edict of President Boris Yeltsin new rates for taxing 
legal entities have been set for 1994. The heaviest one now, the 
profit tax (which accounts for almost half of the budget 
incomes), may amount to a maximum of 35 percent for enterprises. 
And within the framework of the policy proclaimed by the 
government for division of authority between the Center and the 
territories with increased independence for the regions, the 
profit tax has been divided into two independent "channels": 13 
percent is to go into the federal budget, and the local 
authorities (depending on whether they want to support 
production or augment the local budget for social purposes) may 
decide to vary their rate within the range of from 0 to 25 
percent. 
  The commercial banks and insurance companies which, as 
distinct from the enterprises, paid income tax but not profit 
tax last year will now be "like everyone else": The tax has been 
set for them at the level of 30 percent. Naturally the regional 
authorities will need time to analyze the situation and 
determine the amount of the local profit tax. Therefore the 
edict will introduce a uniform tax rate of 22 percent for all of 
Russia until they make their decisions. 
  In addition to the 20-percent value-added tax that existed 
last year, a special tax will be introduced in the amount of 3 
percent for supporting the most important branches of the 
economy. This returns us to the stormy discussions of last year 
between the former Supreme Soviet and the government. The 
latter, trying somehow to cope with the populism of the people's 
deputies, who inflated the expenditure part of the budget, 
submitted to parliament an initiative for a 7-percent tax in 
addition to the value-added tax, of which 4 percent went for the 
support of the agro-industrial complex and 3 percent--the coal 
miners. Parliament cut down this proposal, which was backed by 
the unpopular Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov. It seems that 
there will be no opponents of the special tax this year. 
  In line with its declaration of the shift of emphasis "from 
the monetary to the structural-investment policy," it is also 
necessary to consider the points of the edict concerning 
exemption from taxation of profit used for financing capital 
investments for production and nonproduction purposes and also 
repayment of bank credit used for these purposes. 
  Small enterprises, if they are operating in the sphere of 
production and processing of agricultural products or the output 
of consumer goods or medical equipment, and also if they are 
building housing, will receive tax holidays as they did before: 
during the first two years of their creation they are exempted 
from profit tax. In exactly the same way, goods imported into 
Russia as contributions to the authorized capital of enterprises 
with foreign investments will for a year after it is registered 
again be exempted from the value-added tax. 
  Analysis of the edict shows that the fiscal component of 
taxation has been increased in it. In addition to the 
aforementioned 3-percent tax for financing support of priority 
branches and the new 1-percent transportation tax collected from 
the wage fund of the enterprises, the overall amount of the 
profit tax has been increased to a maximum of 35 percent as 
compared to 32 percent last year. This can be explained by the 
considerable difficulties being experienced by the republic 
budget. While in 1992 incomes made up 29 percent of the GNP, in 
1993 they dropped to 24 percent. This was a reflection not only 
of the reduction of the value-added tax from 28 to 20 percent, 
but also the deterioration of the situation with respect to tax 
collection.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Kamin: "Formation of Duma Budget </F>
Committee. Committee Intends To Begin With Banking Legislation"] 
  [Text] Members of one of the key Duma committees--on 
budget, taxes, banks, and finance--is to complete the formation 
of subcommittees and select their chairmen today. Yesterday the 
deputy chairman of this specialized parliament structure, 
Aleksandr Pochinok, reported to KOMMERSANT-DAILY that it had 
been proposed to create two banking committees among its 
subdivisions. In his words, the banking sphere will be a 
priority in the budget committee's legislative work. 
  The committee includes 45 deputies, and the ratios of the 
numbers of representatives of various political groupings in it 
turned out to be almost proportional to the alignment of forces 
in the Duma. Considering the experience of the last parliament, 
one can assume that the direction of the committee's work will 
be determined basically not by political factors, but rather by 
the demands of the real economic situation. In this connection, 
Aleksandr Pochinok thinks, the banking sphere is optimal for 
cooperation among various political groupings. At the same time 
it is the one that has now become the arena for the harshest 
conflicts of economic interests. Thus, in Pochinok's opinion, 
the high degree of competition in the banking sector of the 
Russian economy has led to attempts on the part of many market 
subjects (for example, the well-known case of the GMM [not 
further identified]) to increase the volume of capital by taking 
advantage of gaps in banking legislation: It has become 
traditional to attract clients' money under a trust agreement 
(which is actually, though not legally, a banking operation) 
without a license from the Central Bank. 
  Mr. Pochinok pointed out that among the immediate measures 
for protecting Russia's secondary financial market from highly 
risky operations it is necessary to adopt a number of laws 
regulating both the procedure for circulation of securities and 
bonds and the activity of its subjects--for example, a law on 
mandatory audits. 
  If the banking sphere does not evoke any special 
disagreements among the politicians, such aspects of the 
committee's activity as currency regulation and management of 
the foreign debt will be objects of constant interest--the 
representative of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia claims 
the right to be in charge of this particular subcommittee. The 
realization of this possibility could create additional 
difficulties for the current government. The more so since 
Russia's Choice, which was initially its main "support" in the 
Duma, has actually gone over to the opposition to Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's cabinet.

<F P=106> [Article by Tamara Maksimenkova, chief specialist of the </F>
Department of Weather Forecasting of Rosgidromettsentr: "Deep 
Sleep Disturbed"] 
  [Text] This January was warm on the European territory of 
the Russian Federation. The average air temperature over most of 
the territory of Northwestern, Central, Central-Chernozem, and 
North Caucasian regions and also in the south of the Volga 
region was 5-7 degrees above the many-year averages, and on the 
rest of the territory of Russia--1-3 degrees. 
  The total negative air temperature for November-January, 
which characterizes the severity of the winter, over a large 
part of the European territory of Russia was 80-90 percent of 
the many-year average air temperatures. 
  But if one does not count the cold November over a large 
part 
of Northwestern, Central, and Central-Chernozem regions and 
Lower Volga Area, the sum of negative air temperatures was only 
25-45 percent of the norm, and in the Northern Caucasus--only 
for the first 10 days of December. 
  In St. Petersburg on 16 January the absolute maximum air 
temperature for that day was surpassed (4.3 degrees as against 
4.1 degrees in 1983). 
  The largest amount of precipitation (180-220 percent of the 
norm and more) fell in the central oblasts of the Non-Chernozem 
zone of Russia. Almost everywhere with the exception of the 
Northern Caucasus and Lower Volga Area the snow cover on fields 
planted in winter grain crops was 20-40 cm and more. 
  The minimum soil temperature at the depth of the tillering 
node of winter crops remained mainly within the range of minus 
3-5. 
  Over the majority of the territory of the Northern region 
and 
the north of Volga-Vyatka and Ural regions, where a deep (30 cm 
and more) snow cover was established during the second half of 
December on slightly frozen soil, by the end of January it had 
increased 1.5-2-fold. The minimum soil temperature at the depth 
of the tillering node of grain crops remained close to zero. 
There is a probability of damage to winter crops by rotting. 
  Beginning in the middle of January the same conditions for 
the wintering of planted areas were created in the northern part 
of the Central region as well. Here the depth of the snow cover 
increased to 30 cm but as a result of the warm weather the depth 
of freezing of the soil decreased and even in the middle of the 
month it was less than 50 cm. 
  The deep winter rest of the winter crops was disturbed--and 
intensive expenditure of nutritive substances for respiration 
began. In regions with a deep (more than 30 cm) snow cover and 
slight (less than 50 cm) freezing of the soil, measures for 
compacting the snow on the fields are very effective. 
  The existence of a crust of ice mainly 15-20 mm thick ground 
into the soil on the fields in the Northwestern, Central, and 
Central-Chernozem regions is unfavorable for winter crops. But 
it is basically under a deep (more than 15 cm) snow cover and 
presents no great danger to the planted areas. 
  Over the majority of territory of the North Caucasus region 
and Lower Volga Area warm weather remained for most of the 
month. The maximum air temperature, especially during the first 
half of the month in the south of Rostov Oblast, Krasnodar and 
Stavropol Krays, and the south of Kalmykia rose to 8-16 degrees. 
  The winter crops began to grow during this period. Shoots 
appeared on the fields with late planting times. 
  The areas with plants that have developed poorly since 
autumn 
increased. The reserves of productive moisture on the fields 
with wintering crops increased and mainly amounted to 30-40 mm 
in the plowed layer of soil, and 110-160 mm in the 1-meter 
layer. At the end of the month it became cold in these regions 
and the plants stopped growing. A snow cover was formed in 
places. The temperature of the soil at the depth of the 
tillering node dropped to slightly negative values. 
  In Western Siberia the wintering of winter grain crops 
proceeded favorably. 
  The planted areas were under a snow cover whose depth was 
mainly 25-35 cm and more. Only in the southwest of Altay Kray 
was there somewhat less snow on the fields--8-12 cm. Therefore, 
in spite of the fact that the air temperature dropped to minus 
30-34 and lower on certain days, the minimum temperature of the 
soil at the depth of the tillering node of winter grain crops 
remained within the range of minus 7 to minus 12 degrees, and in 
the southwest of Altay Kray--minus 15 to minus 17, which was not 
dangerous to the planted areas. 
  According to the preliminary forecast of Rosgidromettsentr, 
in February in the north of Volga-Vyatka and Ural regions the 
air temperature is expected to be one degree below normal. 
Therefore the processes of rotting of winter grain crops are 
somewhat retarded. In Central Volga Area the air temperature is 
also expected to be 1 degree below normal, but there the winter 
grain crops are under a snow cover which reliably protects the 
planted areas from the harmful effects of low temperatures, and 
there will be no freezing on large areas. In the Northern 
Caucasus and Lower Volga Area the quantity of precipitation in 
February is expected to be close to the many-year average, and 
the air temperature--1-2 degrees below normal. The winter grain 
crops will not grow in February. It is not expected that winter 
crops will freeze on large areas since the warm weather in 
December and January led to melting, and in the north of Rostov 
and Volgograd Oblast--to a reduction of the freezing of the soil. 
  In the Northwestern Region where the depth of the snow cover 
on fields planted in winter grain crops is not great (mainly 
less than 10 cm) in February the air temperature is expected to 
be 1 degree above normal. Therefore there will be no freezing of 
winter grain crops on large areas. 
  On the rest of the territory of the Russian Federation the 
air temperature and the quantity of precipitation in February is 
expected to be close to the many-year averages.

Rosgidromettsentr: "White Snows Are Coming"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Forecast for the Month </H5>
  Over a large part of the territory of Russia the circulation 
features of February and the climatic descriptions are extremely 
similar to those of January. 
  During February low pressure system activity in the 
atmosphere is most intensive on the European territory of 
Russia, in the southern regions of Western Siberia, and in the 
eastern outskirts of the country. Almost the same as in January, 
there will be strong winds and snowstorms. The high pressure 
system will remain, encompassing the central regions of Eastern 
Siberia and, to a considerable degree, the Far East. This month 
will be changeable. The sun is already warming the earth on 
calm, clear days in the southern part, but there is still severe 
freezing and snowstorms. 
  What is February expected to be like when it comes into its 
own? 
  In the Central and Central-Chernozem regions the monthly air 
temperature is expected to be close to the many-year average 
(norm), and in the Central-Chernozem region--1-2 degrees above 
the norm, and it is expected to be in the range of minus 5-12. 
The prevailing temperature at night will be minus 5-10 and 
during the day--0 to minus 5. During certain periods of the 
first and second 10-day periods during the night hours the 
freezing will go down to 20-25 degrees. The weather will be 
mainly dry and sunny with few clouds. 
  In the Northwestern region the average monthly temperature 
will be close to normal: minus 7-9. The prevailing temperature 
will be 5-10 degrees below zero, and during the day--from minus 
2 to plus 3. But 20 degrees below during the night hours during 
the first half of the month is also quite probable. There will 
be snow, blizzards, and severe winds up to 15-20 meters per 
second at the beginning and at the end of the month. 
  In the Northern region the average monthly temperature will 
be 1-2 degrees below normal: minus 12-18. At night it will be 
15-20 degrees below zero and during the day--8-13 degrees below 
zero, but on certain nights during the first and second 10-day 
periods the temperature will go down to 25-30 degrees. At times 
there will be snow, blizzards, and individual strong winds up to 
25-30 meters per second. 
  In the Volga-Vyatka region and Central Volga area the 
average 
monthly temperature will be 1-2 degrees above normal, and in the 
north of Volga-Vyatka region--about normal: minus 7-13. The 
freezing at night will go down to 13-18, and during the 
day--7-12. Hard freezing at night down to 20-25 (in the northern 
part of Volga-Vyatka region--down to 30) and during the day down 
to 17-22 degrees may occur during certain parts of the first and 
second 10-day periods. Snow, blizzards, and strong winds are 
most probable at the beginning and end of the month. 
  In the North Caucasus and Lower Volga area the average 
monthly temperature will be 2 degrees above normal: zero to 
minus 5. At night it will be 3-8 degrees and during the 
day--plus 1-5. At the same time one cannot rule out the 
possibility of more severe freezing--down to 13-18 degrees. 
Precipitation in the form of rain and wet snow will amount to 
15-30 mm and, most likely, it will be during the first 10-day 
period and at the end of the month. There will be infrequent 
strong winds up to 15-20 meters per second. 
  In the Ural region and Western Siberia the average monthly 
temperature in northern regions will be 1-2 degrees below normal 
and amount to minus 20-25, and in the southern regions--1-2 
degrees above normal: minus 12-17. In the northern regions at 
night it will be 22-27, and during the day--12-17, but on 
certain nights of the first 10-day period it will be 35 (in the 
south--down to 25-30) degrees. In the southern regions mainly at 
night it will be 15-20 and during the day 8-13 degrees. Snow, 
blizzards, and strong winds are most probable during the second 
and third 10-day periods. 
  In Eastern Siberia the average monthly temperature in the 
northern half of the territory will be close to normal: 23-30 
degrees, and the southern half--1-2 degrees above normal, and 
will amount to 15-22 degrees. The most severe freezing will come 
at about the middle of the month when the mercury will dip at 
night in the north to minus 38-43, and in the south--to minus 
28-33; the rest of the time in the northern half the freezing 
will go down to 25-30 at night and during the day--15-20, and in 
the southern half at night--15-20, and during the day 8-13 
degrees. It will be slightly cloudy, sunny, and there will be a 
little bit of snow only during certain periods. 
  In the Far East the average monthly air temperature will be 
close to normal, and only in Magadan Oblast will it be 1 degree 
lower. In the southern regions at night it will go down to 15-20 
degrees below zero, during the day--8-13, and in the southern 
regions at night 20-25, and during the day 13-18, but at the 
beginning and about the middle of the month it is possible that 
the temperature will drop by 7-10 degrees. Snow and blizzards 
are most probable at the end of the first 10-day period and 
about the middle of the third 10-day period. 
<H5>  ...and for Today </H5>
  According to information from Rosgidromettsentr, a cold low 
pressure system began its path in the south through the European 
part of the country. Following it will be freezing weather in 
the majority of regions. On Wednesday in the Northwestern, 
Central, and Central-Chernozem regions at night it will be 18-23 
degrees, and in places 30 degrees, and during the day--15-20 
degrees. But the depth of the snow cover here is sufficient to 
reliably protect the plants from the cold weather. 
  It will also get colder in the Upper Volga region, and the 
zone of the snowfall will shift to the Lower Volga Area and the 
western part of Kazakhstan. There will be inclement weather with 
precipitation and winds in the Northern Caucasus, where an ice 
crust and fog cannot be ruled out.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Kolysko: "Into a Savings Bank on Wings?"] </F>
  [Text] According to the president's edict, on 1 February 
payment will begin of three times the amount to those citizens 
who deposited their savings before 1 January 1992. Should we 
rejoice? 
  Let us leave in parentheses the fact that the edict of 24 
December 1993 was promulgated only on 29 January 1994. Let us 
note that this event is remarkable by the fact that the 
government itself finally recognized its debt to the depositors. 
But it is in just this pleasantness that questions begin and 
end. And the first one: Why is the sum of compensation 
(threefold) so laughably small? 
  But it is necessary to find even this money somewhere. 
Where? If even in a number of oblast and regions there is 
nothing with which to pay wages. Where did this number 
"threefold" come from? I would like to pose these and a number 
of other questions to people who have some connection with the 
edict. Someone worked on it, which means that someone will 
implement it. But I was not successful in getting any kind of 
information on this from either the Central Bank, the Savings 
Bank, or the Ministry of Finance. Employees of the Central Bank 
said that "for us this edict is like snow on our heads." 
  The document turned out to be just the same unexpected snow 
for the Society for Defending the Interests of Bank Depositors 
(the name of the Society speaks for itself). At their request, 
deputy V. Mukusev raised the issue of indexing deposits at the 
Supreme Soviet and the corresponding law was adopted. Then 
representatives of the Society "passed it by" the Constitutional 
Court, which recognized the justice of their demand. Now in 
connection with the president's edict a statement was adopted at 
the Society's meeting, which states, in part: 
  "The president's edict No 2292 is insulting to us not only 
because of the miserly nature of the proposed compensation, but 
also by the means of finding the money, the proposed sale abroad 
of precious metals and precious stones from the State Reserves 
of Russia. We state that any processes squandering the wealth 
of Russia are unacceptable as a source of money for compensating 
the depositors. Therefore we call upon the RF Federation 
Council to take control of the State Reserves of precious metals 
and precious stones. We are ready to show in open discussion 
that a noninflationary method for restoring the old savings of 
our co-citizens exists." 
  Using similar slogans, having united with Movement for 
Social 
Justice, the Society will picket the central board of Sberbank 
on 10 February. Society co-chairman Valeriy Akinin considers: 
  "Several variants for resolving this problem exist. There is 
even similar foreign experience. It's only necessary to want 
it. A government which will undertake the task of reimbursing 
the full volume of savings will guarantee itself a minimum of 70 
million votes (one for each depositor) in any elections. Elena 
Sannikova, a member of our Society, has worked out a program for 
a noninlfationary restoration of the money, and in the near 
future we will send it to the government." 
  But while the arguments about the forms and size of 
compensation payments are going on, Sberbank has set about 
fulfilling the president's edict. Maria Kasatkina, an employee 
of the Sokolniki Sberbank reported: 
  "Despite the fact that the money promised under the edict 
has 
not been transferred to Sberbank's account, we are beginning to 
pay compensation from the money we have in our own account. 
First to be compensated will be pensioners and invalids, who 
will need to have the corresponding cerfication, passport, and 
savings book. Compensation will be paid to the remaining 
categories of citizens starting on 1 July. According to the 
depositor's wish, the money can be moved anywhere, transferred 
to another account or paid in cash. However, opening 
non-interest deposit accounts for paying for housing and 
communal services, which is mentioned in the president's edict 
and in Sberbank's directive sent to its branches, is not 
provided for." 
  The Sberbank workers asked me: "Write about this so that 
people won't get excited, so that there won't be any panic or 
agitation." 
  Really, what is there to be excited about? In the Sberbank 
closest to my house, dinnertime was approaching. The bank was 
empty. Perhaps the time I chose was unfortunate--TV was showing 
the film "Simply Maria" at the same time.

recognition 
  1. For individuals permanently residing on the territory of 
the Russian Federation on the day the Law takes effect and who 
have a passport of a citizen of the USSR, submission of 
applications for documentation of citizenship in the Russian 
Federation shall not be required. 
  Until the introduction of the identification card and the 
passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation, documents 
confirming citizenship in the Russian Federation shall be: the 
passport of a citizen of the USSR with an indication of 
citizenship in the Russian Federation or a passport of a citizen 
of the USSR with an insert attesting to citizenship affiliation 
in the Russian Federation; the passport of a citizen of the USSR 
with a residency stamp for the place of residence confirming 
permanent residence on the territory of Russia as of 6 February 
1992; a birth certificate, or an identification certificate 
(military identification card) of a military serviceman with an 
insert for it indicating citizenship affiliation in the Russian 
Federation. 
  The procedure for issuing documents attesting to citizenship 
affiliation in the Russian Federation shall be established by 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. 
  2. Military servicemen indicated in Point 3 of the Decree of 
the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation of 17 June 1993 "On

and Additions to the Law of the RSFSR "On Citizenship in the 
RSFSR,"'" shall be recognized as citizens in the Russian 
Federation in keeping with Article 13 of the Law if they were in 
the service as of 6 February 1992. 
  Acquisition of citizenship by birth 
  3. Parents with different citizenship when selecting the 
citizenship of a child shall upon its first birthday submit to 
the internal affairs organs or consular institution in the place 
of residence a copy of the child's birth certificate and written 
consent to the choice of its citizenship. 
  A change in the citizenship of a child under 18 years of 
age, 
one of whose parents has citizenship in the Russian Federation 
and the other--different citizenship, may be effected upon 
application from the parent on the basis of Point "a" of Article 
18 or Point "b" of Part 1 of Article 23 of the Law. 
  A change of the citizenship of a child under 18 years of age

  --a copy of the birth certificate; 
  --a document or properly documented testimony confirming 
that 
the spouse or an immediate relative has citizenship in the 
Russian Federation; 
  --a document confirming that the parents had citizenship in 
the Russian Federation in the past. 
  If there are minor children, depending on the circumstances

<F P=106> [Article by P. Gordeyev: "Energy Resources: At the End of </F>
Their Service Life"] 
  [Text] The fuel and energy complex denotes not only 
the "bread of industry" but also the heat in our homes, motor 
fuel for our cars, and finally the state's main exportable 
commodity. What are the prospects of the sector in the year to 
come? 
  According to projections of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, 
the production and extraction of fuel resources in 
1994 will be 5 percent below the level of last year. In the 
process, the proportion of natural gas in the structure of 
primary fuel and energy resources will increase to 49.5 percent, 
compared to 47 percent last year. 
  The output of oil and gas condensate is expected 
to come to 327 million tonnes in 1994, compared to 354 million 
tonnes last year, of which 83.6 million tonnes will be in the 
first quarter of 1994, compared to 91 million tonnes in the 
first quarter of 1993. In the process, the rate of decline in 
the output of oil will come to 8 percent in 1994, compared to 
11.3 percent in 1993 and 14 percent in 1992. 
  Considerable depletion of oil reserves at the already 
developed pools is the main problem of the sector. This is the 
reason for the high rate of decline in the output of oil. By 
now, 48 percent of the initial oil reserves has been withdrawn 
from these pools. 
  It is only possible to prevent a drop in the output of oil 
on 
the condition that new pools with total reserves of about 6.5 
billion tonnes are put into production in an accelerated manner. 
With a view to providing incentives for such work, the 
government exempted enterprises of the oil industry from the 
payment of export and import duties in 1993, as well as from the 
compulsory sale of foreign exchange proceeds from the delivery 
of oil for export. The above preferences yielded about 1.8 
trillion rubles [R] to the oil-producing enterprises. Foreign 
companies were used to repair wells. 
  As a result of the measures taken, industrial production was 
started at 27 oil pools in the first 10 months of 1993 alone, 
compared to 10 pools in 1992. 
  In order to build on this trend, a government decision 
envisions leaving up to 60 percent of oil produced by new wells 
at the disposal of the sector so that proceeds from its sale 
will be earmarked for upgrading, new construction projects, and 
the development of new pools. 
  The process of forming new market structures (joint-stock 
companies, oil companies, joint ventures with foreign 
investment) will continue in the oil industry. In 1993 the 
production of oil by these enterprises increased by a factor of 
more than two compared to 1992 and reached about 12 million 
tonnes. According to a projected estimate, in 1994 they will 
produce on the order of 14 million tonnes. 
  The delivery of crude oil to oil-refining 
enterprises is projected for 1994 in the amount of 226 
million tonnes, of which 59 million tonnes will be in the first 
quarter, that is, at a level approximating that of last year. 
The output of light refinery products will increase somewhat due 
to the deeper processing of the raw material, and will come to 
32.2 million tonnes of gasoline, 58.1 million tonnes of diesel 
fuel, and 12.5 million tonnes of jet fuel. 
  Low capacity utilization of the oil refineries of Russia in 
primary oil processing poses a problem in the development of the 
industry. Capacity utilization (excluding the enterprises of the 
city of Groznyy) is expected to amount to 72 percent this year. 
Some enterprises are at the critical level of capacity 
utilization. These are the Saratov Oil Refinery (55 percent), 
the Orsknefteorgsintez Production Association (61 percent), the 
Kuybyshevnefteorgsintez Production Association (62 percent) and 
the Bashneftekhimzavody Production Association (57 percent). A 
further decline in the processing of products will bring about a 
sharp drop in effectiveness, a growth in the costs of 
production, and a deterioration in the quality of manufactured 
products, which will cause additional difficulties in selling 
them. 
  With a view to improving the effectiveness of crude oil 
processing, the government has resolved to upgrade 17 out of 28 
Russian oil refineries. Long-term quotas for the export of 
refinery products have been allocated to these enterprises by 
way of state support measures. In 1993 oil-refining enterprises 
were also exempted from the compulsory sale of 50 percent of 
foreign exchange proceeds and from the payment of export customs 
duties. 
  The gas industry, which has a more reliable raw 
material base, has a realistic opportunity to increase the 
production of fuel and energy resources. In 1994 the output of 
gas is expected to amount to 620 billion cubic meters, 165.2 
billion cubic meters of which in the first quarter. 
  However, the failure of consumers to pay for gas consumed, 
which has been continuous in recent years, has brought about a 
virtual halt of construction work in the sector because of lack 
of funds. By the end of 1993 the amount of arrears in payments 
for gas reached 2.124 trillion rubles. 
  In conjunction with this, the volume of work on surface 
facilities at Urengoy, Yamburg, and other fields in the 
Nadym-Pur-Tazovskiy region in Tyumen Oblast has been reduced, as 
well as that of the work on developing fields on the Yamal 
Peninsula and the construction of main gas pipelines and their 
lateral pipelines (in the first 10 months of 1993, 441 
kilometers out of 6,758 kilometers planned by the enterprises 
were commissioned, as were four compressor stations out of 27). 
  The volume of coal production in 1994 is projected 
to reach 275 million tonnes, compared to 300 million tonnes in 
1993. 
  The growth of transportation rates for freight carriage has 
perceptibly promoted the shrinkage of markets for the sale of 
coal both within Russia and for export. Thus, the carriage of 
steam coal from the Kuznetsk area over 3,000-4,000 kilometers 
within the country actually doubles its final price due to the 
cost of delivery. The price of coal exceeds world prices if it 
is exported over 4,000-5,000 kilometers to the port of shipment. 
With a view to rectifying this situation with regard to the 
Kuzbass, a decision has now been made which envisions reducing 
railway tariffs by a factor of two for the export shipment of 
coal, with financial assistance provided to railway 
transportation enterprises and organizations. 
  A continuous deterioration of the pool of mines and the 
growth of production costs and the danger level in mining 
operations are some of the main problems of the sector. Of 270 
mines, 60 percent have been in service for more than 20 years 
and have not been upgraded throughout the entire period of 
operation. 
  A shortage of financial funds exacerbated by delays in the 
receipt of subsidies from the budget and consumer arrears is the 
restricting factor in coal production. Work on the construction 
and upgrading of 48 underground mines and strip mines has 
already been suspended for this reason. 
  A decision to establish a fund of financial support for 
coal-producing enterprises through the introduction of a special 
tax has been made in order to financially stabilize the 
operation of the coal industry. The monies of this fund will be 
earmarked for reorganizing unpromising underground and strip 
mines, implementing restructuring and development of the sector, 
maintaining social facilities, and making payments under the 
pay-scale agreement. 
  A list of unpromising underground and strip mines, with a 
total coal-producing capacity of 11.2 million tonnes a year and 
number of industrial and production personnel exceeding 48,000, 
has been drawn up. At the first stage it is planned to close 
down 11 mines with a total capacity of 2 million tonnes of coal 
a year, with the number of industrial and production personnel 
coming to 9,600. 
  In conjunction with this, a program for restructuring the 
coal industry will have to be developed in 1994 and its 
implementation will have to begin. The program should envision 
an improvement in the competitiveness of coal production and 
reorganization of unpromising underground mines and strip mines, 
including a subprogram for ensuring the employment of released 
miners. 
  The generation of electricity in 1994 is projected 
in the amount of 910 billion kw-hours (in the first quarter--167 
billion kw-hours), compared to 945 billion kw-hours in 1993 (in 
the first quarter--277 billion kw-hours). A strained power 
supply situation continues in a number of regions of Russia. An 
electricity deficit in North Caucasus has been caused mainly by 
a power capacity shortage in conjunction with the suspension of 
the construction of the Rostov AES [nuclear power station], in 
the Transbaykal area--by the failure to commission capacity at 
the Kharanor Power Station, and in the Far East--by a shortage 
of fossil fuels. 
  Consumer insolvency is the main problem of the power 
industry, as in all sectors of the fuel and energy complex. 
  State regulation of electricity and heat rates at two 
levels, 
federal and regional, by the relevant energy commissions is 
expected to be maintained in 1994, and the system of electricity 
rates for consumers is expected to be streamlined. In the 
process, the procedure in effect for settlements for electricity 
with agricultural consumers should change, with the latter being 
transferred to the regulated group. Rates for the 
energy-intensive enterprises of the metallurgical and chemical 
industries should be set by applying the 0.8 coefficient to the 
level of average transfer rates for electricity for industrial 
consumers in a region, and rates for research institutes and 
centers of national significance which have energy-intensive 
production facilities--at the average producer cost of 
electricity in a region. 
  The commissioning of more than 1.6 million kw of new power 
capacity is planned for 1994, including the Kharanor State 
Regional Electric Power Station, the Komsomolsk and Tomsk Heat 
and Electric Power Stations, the Kolyma Hydroelectric Power 
Station, and other installations.

<F P=106> [Article from INTERFAX news agency: "You Want To Own a GES"] </F>
  [Text] Russia intends to start selling, for 
privatization checks, shares of the country's largest power 
producer -- the Russian Joint-Stock Power Engineering and 
Electrification Company, the Unified Power System of Russia (RAO 
YeES Rossii). 
  Being offered for sale at a check auction, which will take 
place from the 7th of February through the 28th of March in the 
territory of more than 70 regions of Russia, are 14 percent of 
the shares of RAO Unified Power System of Russia in the amount 
of 9,518,908,000 rubles [R]. The face value of a single share 
amounts to R500. 
  A portion of the shares of RAO Unified Power System of 
Russia, which belongs to the joint-stock company itself and is 
not subject to primary distribution, is being offered by the 
Russian brokerage house, C. A. and Co., Ltd. (the RAO's official 
dealer) for sale in the secondary market at a price exceeding 
the face value by a factor of 5. 
  The RAO Unified Power System of Russia was established at 
the 
end of 1992 "in order to preserve the integrity of the Russia 
power system under the conditions of privatization." The Russian 
joint-stock company is made up of 73 power enterprises which are 
supposed to transfer to the Unified Power System's charter 
capital a controlling block of their own shares (51 percent). 
  During the joint-stock conversion, the labor collective 
received around 22 percent of the shares. Fifty-one percent of 
the shares of the Unified Power System of Russia is being 
reserved as state property for a period of 3 years. 
  More than 1 million people work in the Unified Power System 
of Russia. The joint-stock company's charter capital amounts to 
R70 billion. In 1992, the overall output of electric power by 
the enterprises which make up the system amounted to around 1 
trillion kilowatt-hours.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Viktorovich Sakharnov, president of AO </F>
Boguchangesstroy, by RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA staff correspondent 
Vladimir Khrustalev, Kodinsk: "To Whom the Angara Dividends Will 
Accrue"; date and place not given] 
  [Text] The joint-stock conversion of the largest 
Russian power project under construction has begun -- that of 
the Boguchanskaya GES [Hydroelectric Power Plant], and, along 
with it, the transformation of the hired hand into an owner. Our 
correspondent talks with Yuriy Sakharnov, president of the AO 
Boguchangesstroy [Joint-Stock Company Boguchanskaya GES 
Construction]. 
  [Khrustalev] From the government's decision on joint-stock 
conversion of the Boguchanskaya GES to the issuing of 
certificates is an enormous distance. 
  [Sakharnov] The lengthy procedures have in no way violated 
the privatization conditions stipulated by the Russian 
Federation President's edict for the version chosen by us. What 
has occurred has been just the transfer from the Krasnoyarsk 
Kray's Property Fund to the Russian Joint-Stock Company, the 
Unified Power System of Russia, of 49 percent of the shares 
intended for sale at auctions to large investors, including 
foreign ones. This, I believe, is a correct and sensible step. 
  We have overcome the psychological barrier of the 
preconceived opinion: whatever goes outside the boundaries of 
the kray is no longer ours. Indeed, if things are considered 
objectively, the kray authorities are in no position to invest 
in a construction project. But, having transferred the block of 
shares to RAO YeES Rossii [Unified Power System of Russia], they 
have opened the oxygen valve for a project which is of paramount 
importance both for the kray's economy and for the 
transformations of all of Russia. 
  In other respects, however, the distribution is as before. 
Almost a fourth of all the securities will be sold to small 
investors at check auctions. And 26.6 percent remains in the 
labor collective. 
  [Khrustalev] Is this a lot or a little? 
  [Sakharnov] Sufficient, if it is kept in mind that the 
overall number of shares is around one and a half million. A 
third of the cited portion, or 8.7 percent, will be received 
free of charge by the workers of AO Boguchanskaya GES 
Construction. A tenth part, or 2.6 percent of the securities, 
will go by private tender at a discount of the face value of 30 
percent and on a 3-year installment plan. Five percent of the 
shares is for officials and the administration. In the event of 
the introduction of new production lines and an increase in the 
collective, there still remains an enterprise workers 
joint-stock conversion fund of 10 percent. 
  [Khrustalev] I would like to know, what will the individual 
Ivanov, Petrov and Sidorov have? 
  [Sakharnov] The collective is diverse. And here, of course, 
consideration will be given to the realities in each specific 
instance. The number of preferred shares, for example, will 
depend on the salary (after all, it corresponds to the 
qualifications) and the length of service in Boguchanskaya GES 
Construction. Also not forgotten will be those who are on 
pensions or who left because of a reduction in force. If a male 
worker's length of service in Boguchanskaya GES Construction is 
not less than 10 years and that of a female worker is 7.5 years, 
they are alloted securities at a 30-percent discount on the 
installment plan. 
  Of course, one owner will not be equal to another. But if 
you 
are interested in average figures for the joint-stock company, 
here they are: each worker will receive 38 shares, of which, 11 
will be preferred. 
  [Khrustalev] And how will it be with the vouchers? 
  [Sakharnov] They will also figure in. Half of all the shares 
can be acquired using privatization checks. 
  [Khrustalev] Tell me honestly, Yuriy Viktorovich, will it be 
possible for the shares owned by a Boguchanskaya GES 
Construction worker to provide income for him in his old age? 
  [Sakharnov] Everyone will very quickly become aware of the 
fact that this is no mirage. Judge for yourself: just the July 
revaluation raised the face value of a share from 1,000 rubles 
[R] to R27,000. I am confident that the new revaluation will 
increase this figure by a factor of 5 or 6. But it is necessary 
to distinguish clearly between the dividends and the actual cost 
value of a share. 
  Of course, the income will depend, first of all, on how many 
shares the worker has and, to a large extent, on what kind of 
dividend there is. Presently, it amounts to 10 percent of the 
net profit. If we currently have a net profit of R500 million, 
then the portion for each shareholder is determined 
arithmetically: we divide R50 million by the number of 
securities. Pretty slim, you might say. True, it is slim for the 
time being. However, profit is a quantity which fluctuates. When 
the plant is commissioned and all credit debts have been paid 
off, it will become very respectable. 
  But the actual worth of a share is already currently 
sufficiently high. In really comparable current prices of the 
charter fund, if a share were sold at auction, it might, even 
today, go for $100. Under conditions, however, when new projects 
are started, the worth of a security also increases. 
  It is also possible to give a specific example of this. It 
would be appropriate, for example, to recall that, after the 
power plant's start-up, according to the specialists' 
calculations, the annual profit will amount to $280 million. So 
it is easy to imagine what kind of pursuit will begin for 
Boguchanskaya GES shares in some 5 to 10 years.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Lantsman under the rubric </F>
"Privatization": "A New National Symbol Is Being Born in Russia: 
Its Largest Enterprise--Russian EES RAO--Goes on the Block"] 
  [Text] If the owners of privatization vouchers adequately 
react to the activism of Anatoliy Chubays' agency, which has 
increased perceptibly since the beginning of the year, the phase 
of privatization of state property in Russia may be completed 
considerably earlier than its 31 June 1994 deadline. 
  As is known, in January a substantial share of stock in such 
"voucher-intensive" enterprises as Gorkiy (Nizhniy Novgorod) and 
Volzhskiy (Tolyatti) auto works have been put up to an 
all-Russian voucher auction. All records will probably be 
surpassed, however, in February and March when the largest 
production association--the Russian Power Generation and 
Electrification Joint-Stock Society (Russian EES RAO), created 
on the basis of the former All-Union Ministry of Power 
Generation and Electrification--will go through the purgatory of 
privatization. From 7 February through 28 March, a package of 24 
million shares (20 percent of the charter capital) with the face 
value of R500 each will be sold through an interregional voucher 
auction. 
  The Russian Unified Power System today includes 589 thermal 
power stations, 102 hydraulic power stations, and nine nuclear 
power stations with the total capacity of 212 million kwh, as 
well as 2.5 million kilometers of power transmission lines. It 
employs a total of 1.3 million persons. In terms of scale, only 
the U.S. power generation system can compete with it. Russian 
EES RAO functions as a holding company, whose charter 
capital--about R70 billion--consists of the share of property 
(between 49 and 100 percent) of 72 regional power generation 
systems. The capital stock is distributed as follows: 51 percent 
of shares remain for three years under state control but in 
trust, to be managed by the company; 30 percent is distributed 
among the federation components in proportion to their volume of 
power consumption. Labor collectives have a right to acquire up 
to 15 percent of preferential and privileged stock and between 1 
and 15 percent of common stock. 
  The Russian EES RAO leadership sees the main sector 
transformation task as creating a market for electric power: 
competition among its producers while at the same time retaining 
the manageability both at the regional level and within the 
framework of the unified system. According to Russian EES RAO 
President Anatoliy Dyakov, all requirements of the current 
antitrust legislation have been complied within the 
privatization documents, although a monopoly in such a strategic 
sector is quite justified and is the current state of affairs in 
all civilized countries. 
  It should be noted that of 72 regional systems operating in 
Russia, 51 experience shortages of electric power, and the rest 
produce a surplus of it. In order to maintain fairness, some 
large stations that produce surplus power have been transferred 
into direct management of the holding company. The system of 
competition among producers (the wholesale market) and suppliers 
(retail market) is structured in such a way that at any given 
second flow controllers select the cheapest power available. 
  The main monopoly tool--rates--remains in the hands of the 
state. Because of administrative regulation of rate increases, 
Russian EES RAO sustains enormous losses, since rate increases 
do not keep up with prices for hydrocarbon raw materials. Rates 
are revised quarterly by a federal commission on power 
generation, and once a month on the regional level. But even 
with the government slowing down the growth of prices for 
electric power, today the sector's arrears amount to more than 
R3 trillion. Nevertheless, the company management assures that 
debts are not going to have any effect on payment of dividends. 
They will be handled through other unrestricted line items. 
  The Russian EES RAO does not promise its shareholders high 
dividends. The management of the joint-stock society believe 
that the main attraction of its stock is that it is safe; they 
are also counting on high degree of its liquidity in the 
secondary securities market. In the not too distant future the 
Russian EES RAO intends to become as much of a national symbol 
of our country as Ford and AT&amp;T are in the United States.

<F P=106> [Viktor Yurlov report: "God Has Been Patient. And Has Told </F>
the Miner What To Do?: The Miners' Dialogue With the Government 
Is Expected To Be Difficult, As Always"] 
  [Text] ITAR-TASS report: 
  The atmosphere in the mining outfits of Vorkuta is 
heating up, threatening to explode any time soon in mass 
strikes. The reason is the long delays in the payment of wages 
for previous months. The miners have been promised by their 
leadership that the wages for past months will be paid before 1 
February, before 5 February at the latest. This today has thus 
far kept the miners from mass protest actions and social unrest. 
Although local strikes are breaking out continually. 
  Editorial comment: 
  Simultaneously with this report RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA also 
received a statement of the Russian Independent Coal Industry 
Workers' Union--Rosugleprof. As we all know, this union has 
always aspired to a resolution of the complex problems of social 
protection of the working people on the basis of mutual 
understanding and cooperation with the Government of Russia. But 
the treasury's debt to the sector for realization of the 1993 
Sectoral Wage-Rate Agreement has not yet been cleared. At some 
coal enterprises the workers have not been paid for October 
even. The treasury's debt for the past year amounts to R272 
billion. Some 19 million tonnes of coal, whose shipment is being 
held up on account of the enterprises' debt to the railroads, 
has built up at the coal dumps in January. At the same time, on 
the other hand, consumers' arrears on coal that has already been 
shipped has amounted to R705 billion. 
  The Rosugleprof demands of the government payment of the 
treasury's debt to the coal industry before 1 February. The 
conclusion of the Sectoral Wage-Rage Agreement in January. An 
immediate solution of the question of the clearance for the 
consumers of the arrears in respect to the coal that has already 
been shipped. Otherwise, the statement says, the miners will be 
forced to switch from a policy of social partnership to 
collective action--strikes. 
  It is hard to say how the government will behave in this 
situation. On the one hand the debts have to be paid. Especially 
since it was promised that the reforms would be turned in the 
direction of social protection of the populace. On the other, it 
will be necessary to increase money issue in the first quarter, 
which will inevitably signify an increase in inflation. Had B. 
Fedorov stayed on as minister of finance, the problem would have 
been resolved unequivocally: no payments. Stabilization of the 
ruble--at any price--was more important for B. Fedorov. The 
present government is no less interested than the ex-minister in 
stabilization, but it knows the costs of reforms not from 
timetables but from real life. And, it would seem, has a 
sympathetic attitude toward our problems. The search for an 
alternative is expected to be difficult.

  [Text] Moscow--Disturbing news: The oil workers of the 
Republic of Komi are once again threatening to shut off the 
valves. They really do have more than enough reason to strike: 
wages in Usinsk, Ukhta, and the majority of other 
administrations of the Komineft Stock Company have not been paid 
since last November. 
  Today the situation is exacerbated in the extreme: the 
Presidium of the Russian Council of the Union of Workers of the 
Oil and Gas Sectors of Industry and Construction 
(Neftegazstroyprofsoyuz) has sent an appeal to all oil-producing 
associations for support for the "ultimatum" of the oil workers 
of Usinsk. It is demanded that the Governments of the Russian 
Federation and Komi make good the wage arrears before 1 February 
and settle accounts in full for the oil that has been supplied 
to the consumers. 
  As Valeriy Bendyuzhik, deputy chairman of the Komi Republic 
Neftegazstroyprofsoyuz Committee, announced, in the event of 
this warning going unheeded by the authorities, the union will 
be forced to adopt, in accordance with the law, a decision on 
the date of commencement of a strike.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Smyk: "The Obstacles of Gaydarism: </F>
Domestic Metallurgy Is on the Verge of Disaster"] 
  [Text] The lament of our mass media with respect to Gaydar 
and Fedorov should convince our compatriots of the fact that the 
management corps which is taking the reins of government into 
its hands will bring the country to the catastrophe, from which 
the radical reform wing was allegedly keeping it. The ink had 
not even managed to dry on the edict about the dismissal of Ye. 
Gaydar and B. Fedorov had not yet left his office when the 
dollar dutifully shot up, promising a jump in inflation and 
prices: as if to say what things will be like without reform's 
two knights in shining armor. 
  Meanwhile, all the talk about stabilization of the ruble and 
a deficit-free budget is nothing more than a diversionary 
maneuver which masks a system of purposeful destruction of the 
economy, which our shock therapists have been methodically 
carrying out. In the fall, at the conciliation commission of 
metallurgists and miners, which was established after coal 
prices were freed, the leaders of Magnitka [Magnitogorsk 
Metallurgical Combine] and the Novokuznetsk and other combines 
warned that the enterprises could not endure a sevenfold surge 
in coal prices and that 1993 might turn out to be the last year 
in the history of domestic metallurgy. And so, recently, the 
leaders of this sector, at an expanded collegium of their own 
committee, summed up the results of the past year in the 
presence of Oleg Soskovets and other members of the government. 
  The increase in coal prices has led to repeated increases in 
the railroad rates and a sharp increase in electric power 
prices. The nonpayment fine for it is equal to 2 percent per day 
and, inasmuch as, as a rule, an enterprise has no money, the 
payments just for the fines for electricity are beginning to 
climb above world prices. The increase in the railroad shipping 
rates, given the enormous expanses of Russia, have led to the 
fact that the transportation cost has begun to exceed the cost 
of the ore and even of enriched iron-ore raw material. The 
Magnitogorsk combine, for example, is paying 10,000 rubles [R] 
for a metric ton of sinter and R12,000 for shipping it. 
  Taking into account the shipping, the cost of domestic ore 
has become higher than the world cost. As a result of all the 
expenses, the prices for metal products have also risen to the 
world level and, in a number of instances, exceeded it. 
Exporting is becoming unprofitable. Whereas, back in the summer, 
for Magnitka, the profitability of exporting was equal to 25 
percent, it has currently declined to 2 percent. In the domestic 
market, the effective demand for metal products has decreased 
catastrophically and whereas, prior to July of last year, the 
metallurgical sector was able to make ends meet, after prices 
were freed, the metallurgy workers found themselves in debt to 
the miners, the railroad workers and the power industry workers. 
  "I am bankrupt," N. Ordzhonikidze, head of the Krasnyy 
Oktyabr plant, declared to the managers who had gathered in the 
hall of the collegium of Roskommetallurgiya [Russian Federation 
Committee on Metallurgy]. "Anyone here who is not bankrupt, 
raise your hand." 
  And not a single hand was raised. Even I. Frantsenyuk, the 
manager of the sector's most technically advanced enterprise, 
the Novokuznetsk combine, stated that his enterprise will become 
unprofitable this year. 
  There is one mysterious thing: everyone is talking about 
inflation, emission and the fact that the printing press is 
operating at full power, yet the enterprises have no money. They 
are putting out products, but the consumers are not paying them 
and they themselves, of course, cannot pay for the shipments of 
raw ore material and coking coals. Really, is this inflation 
real or artificial, something specially contrived for the 
purpose of bringing down Russia's economy? The producer does not 
have the money he earned -- it is sitting in the banks. The 
latter are especially hindering monetary settlements, so that 
"payments" are sitting for months; the plants' funds are being 
withdrawn from the productive sphere and sent into the trade 
network in the form of high-interest short-term credit. The 
productive sphere is being brought to ruin during this time, the 
shadow structures and commercial banks are growing rich and this 
entire ridiculous system of financial destruction of industry is 
called inflation, for which, supposedly, those at fault are the 
plants and kolkhozes established in the "era of totalitarianism" 
and which, so it is said, are needed by no one. The rails are 
falling apart, the railroad cars are worn out and high-quality 
metal for engines cannot be found, yet metal products lie 
unclaimed and the metallurgy workers have nothing with which to 
pay for coal and electricity. And so it becomes necessary to 
turn off the blast furnaces, shut off the electric melting units 
and, the main thing, shut down the coke-oven batteries. 
  Any manager, no matter what the financial problems, will 
find 
money for the coal miners -- he will persuade his colleague, the 
manager of the mine, to wait and not pay the ore-dressing 
combine, but he will find funds for the coking needs because the 
coke-oven batteries must not be shut down: the refractory 
brickwork would be ruined and shutting down the batteries is 
tantamount to putting them out of commission. 
  "The most terrible thing is happening now," I. Frantsenyuk 
acknowledged, "the destruction of the coking supply." 
  The Serov metallurgical combine has been shut down. The pipe 
plants and the rolled aluminum plants are operating at 20-30 
percent of capacity. At the Chelyabinsk combine, the 
electric-furnace steel shop, which produced metal for space 
vehicles, has been shut down. The shutting down of enterprises 
is occurring, first of all, because the state is being led by 
the money men in price matters. But, under monopoly conditions 
and the absence of competition, the price does not reflect the 
actual cost of the product. A monopoly will set prices to cover 
costs at the expense of the consumer and thus, it will preserve 
technological backwardness. 
  "The liberalization of prices, which declared as its goal 
the 
overcoming of the spending mechanism of the economy, in 
actuality, is stimulating it," noted S. Afonin, chairman of the 
Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy. 
  Almost every enterprise manager talked about the tax 
situation. The creation of taxes is still one important part of 
the activities of our glorious money men for eliminating the 
country's economic potential. 
  And, oh, the kinds of taxes which are being devised and 
approved by the department of our "No 2 Marketer," Boris 
Fedorov! A perfect example is the tax devised last year "on the 
exchange rate difference," which, instead of encouraging the 
producing exporter, is forcing the latter to pay for the 
devaluation of the ruble, as if inflation were not ravaging the 
enterprise, but rather, bringing it a profit. 
  It is significant that B. Fedorov's department has currently 
established, in essence, the same level of taxes as existed 
under the planned socialist system (more than 80 kopecks from 
each ruble of profit), but without the guaranteed delivery of 
raw materials, assured sales market and budget financing. No 
other country in the world has such a level of taxation. 
  Yet still, one thought stood out like a sore thumb in all 
the 
statements. The metallurgical plants, the mines and the dressing 
combines are overwhelmingly enterprises which form cities. If 
the Cherepovets combine closes (and its manager, Yuriy Lipukhin, 
during the last Vorkuta strike, was already issuing an order 
about closing the combine), what is to be done with the workers 
and what are the rest of the residents of Cherepovets, the 
economy of which is supported by the combine, supposed to do? 
The same situation is faced by Magnitogorsk, Nizhniy Tagil, 
Lipetsk.... Meanwhile, the social situation in the metallurgical 
regions is heating up. Boris Prokudin, the manager of the 
Chelyabinsk plant, declared that the workers' patience is not 
without limits and, if the wage payment situation does not 
change, the people of the Urals "will take up arms." 
  Thus, at the meeting in the collegium hall, the metallurgy 
workers unrolled before the members of the government a panorama 
of their own difficult problems. They least of all complained 
about the situation and they analyzed it: why did a basic 
industry, on which the country's industry is supported, due to 
the endeavors of the macroeconomists, find itself threatened 
with destruction? They thought about how to correct the 
situation. 
  Russian First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets said that 
it 
is necessary to establish a state set of measures for the 
revitalization of investment activities. He requested that the 
metallurgy workers prepare, in a thesis format, the most 
important of their proposals for consideration in the 
government. Time will show whether or not they find support 
there, but one thing is clear: the renovated cabinet, before 
getting down to actual reforms for Russia's economy, will have 
to do quite a bit of work on doing away with the obstacles left 
by the money men.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Podlipskiy: "Russia Is Ready To Limit </F>
Aluminum Production"] 
  [Text] This week Russia will most probably announce 
its consent to a voluntary 500,000-tonne cut in its aluminum 
production capacities. This conclusion can be drawn from the 
speeches of members of the government Commission on Operations 
Problems, the first 1994 meeting of which was held yesterday in 
the Government House, on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment. 
<H5>  The State of Russia's Aluminum Industry: </H5>

  -  Primary 
aluminum production in 1993 constituted about 2,900 million 
tonnes 
  -  Of this amount, 2.3 million tonnes were processed in 
Russia 
  -  By September 1993, primary aluminum production had been 
cut back by only 7 percent 
  -  The amount of aluminum processed at 
Russian enterprises was cut to 0.3 million tonnes 
  Three 
questions were introduced at the meeting of the commission, 
which was chaired by Oleg Soskovets, first vice-premier. The 
most important of them, unquestionably, was the draft of the 
governmental decree "On Measures To Stabilize the Work of the 
Aluminum Industry." In the words of Serafim Afonin, chairman of 
the Russian Committee on Metallurgy, up to September of last 
year the sector was working quite stably. After that, however, 
because of the increased ruble outlay for electric power (its 
share in the production cost increased from 17 to 34 percent on 
the average for the sector) and because of rapidly growing 
transport costs, practically all 11 Russian aluminum plants 
entered the "corridor of loss" (the boundaries of which are 
determined by the prices for the metal on the world market, on 
the one hand, and the relation of the ruble and the dollar in 
Russia, on the other). 
  Russian aluminum producers are therefore faced with two very 
major problems at a minimum. In the first place, the forthcoming 
500,000-tonne cutback in production. It is obvious that this 
government decision lays the foundation for a bitter fight on 
the part of the directors to protect their plants from 
artificial shutdown. The words of one of the directors of the 
Bratsk Aluminum Plant may serve as confirmation of the fact that 
there will be no place for corporate solidarity in this fight: 
"Yes, we must curtail production, but let us do it somewhere 
over there" (he has in mind the plants in the European part of 
the country). If the government, however, still refuses 
voluntary mothballing of capacities, the European Union will 
maintain rigid quotas for the import of Eastern aluminum, and on 
the American market, in the words of Aleksandr Shokhin, a 
multitude of anti-dumping processes awaits us. This can in the 
end lead to the loss of these two very important Russian 
aluminum export markets (approximately 1.0-1.4 million tonnes a 
year). 
  The aluminum plant directors attending the meeting, however, 
were inclined to blame most of their economic disorder on the 
electric power workers who, in their opinion, unjustifiably 
raised the prices for their products too high. They feel that 
the best way out of this situation is to fix prices for electric 
power at a level of 0.7-1.0 American cents per kilowatt-hour. 
Lira Rozenova, chairman of the Russian Committee on Prices, 
however, thought that this price was too low, and agreed that, 
as an experiment, the price could be set at a level of 1.5 cents 
per kilowatt-hour. This, in her opinion, would cause only a 
5-percent price rise for electricity for other consumers. The 
representatives of the electric power workers, however, agreed 
with neither the one nor the other variant. 
  As a result, the members of the commission came to the 
conclusion that the draft of the government decree submitted by 
the Russian Metallurgy Committee has to be finalized in a week. 
In the words of Oleg Soskovets, the main attention should be 
paid to raising the domestic demand for aluminum, sharply 
reduced as the result of the diminishing of orders from the 
country's military-industrial complex. In addition, at the 
meeting of the commission the idea was again raised of cartel 
agreements: it was proposed to the aluminum and electric power 
producers that they come to an agreement on a bilateral basis on 
lowering prices for the goods they supplied each other. 
Incidentally, a day earlier, Soskovets, in an interview with a 
KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, noted: "In this country, it is 
not the fact of carrying out a cartel agreement, but that they 
cannot come to an agreement on it."

first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of Armenia, for half a year. Not all that long, but how the man 
has changed! A lively and witty person in the past, he is now 
sad, his judgments categorical and cutting. 
  "Why do you all keep talking about Zhirinovskiy, his 
inclination to divide Russia into 50 provinces? In Armenia, 85 
percent of the population are agreeable to becoming a Russian 
district. I would dare say that there is no such thing as an 
independent state. We in Armenia feel more acutely than others 
the trouble hanging over Russia as well, but you do not have 
such a perception!" he said angrily. 
  [Nikiforova] Are you not exaggerating the danger? 
  [Badalyan] More likely, the reverse: I do not know the 
details, but the policy of "leading"--that is, 
capitalist--countries is aimed at driving a wedge between Russia 
and Iran, the Arab countries. Armenia is a small isthmus and the 
main obstacle in the geopolitical game of Israel, Turkey, and 
the United States. It stands in the way of Turkey, which has 
gained strength over the past 200 calm years, forming an 
alliance with Azerbaijan, stealing Central Asian republics and 
reaching the Altay peoples. The Karabakh problem was not put on 
the agenda by the Armenians. Remember the stormy beginning of 
perestroyka, with its slogans of modernization of socialism. 
They roused even the passive ones; it appeared that people had 
gained a second wind and were ready to live in a new way. 
  This situation, however, was used by anticommunist, 
anti-Soviet forces. All sorts of Starovoytovs and Sheynises 
began to visit us, and they pulled the movement into a different 
direction. The situation also became uncontrollable because 
knowledgeable party cadres have already been dismissed, while 
the young ones have not yet gained experience or learned to 
think on a large scale and with an eye on the future. Please 
understand: Armenia cannot live without Russia, but Russia will 
also lose a lot without Armenia. I am amazed that people take 
seriously the absurdities suggested to us by people proffering 
their advice from abroad--Solzhenitsyn, for instance--that 
Russia, as he says, can survive in a union with only Belarus and 
Ukraine. Nonsense! Russia either may stay as it was when it was 
called the Soviet Union, or it will shrink like shagreen leather 
to the borders of the Moscow principality. 
  [Nikiforova] This is a serious problem, requiring careful 
thought and sensitivity. Let us put it straight, though: Perhaps 
you are driven by a genetic fear of Turkey? Is there not in 
your--generally fair--position a consumerist attitude toward 
Russia? 
  [Badalyan] No, and no again. I cannot be accused of an 
anti-Muslim attitude. Moreover, I understand the Azeris, 
too--they also have found themselves in the role of hostage. But 
we cannot underestimate the danger. I believe that a solution 
should be found to the Karabakh problem that will satisfy 
everyone, including Russia. The people paid too high a price for 
the indecisiveness of the CPSU Central Committee. Armenia tied 
its fate to Russia 200 years ago--who can reject people who 
joined the state voluntarily? 
  [Nikiforova] Is this the position of Armenian Communists? 
  [Badalyan] All reasonable people in the republic think this 
way, with the exception of the government, perhaps. You should 
have heard how indignant people were over the statement of our 
prime minister who, answering to the question of the Communist 
faction in the parliament as to why Armenia has refused to join 
the ruble zone, said: "The terms that were accepted by 
Tajikistan do not befit an independent state!" Meanwhile, people 
in long lines are outraged: Does he believe that we are 
independent?! We have been independent for 70 years. Now we have 
to work and work to achieve such independence! People even begin 
to mention the Dashnaks, who in 1929 voluntarily surrendered 
power in order to save the people! 
  [Nikiforova] Does it mean that people support the communist 
idea of restoring the Union of republics? In your opinion, has 
your prediction of last year--that 1993 would be a decisive year 
for the Communist Party of Armenia--come true? 
  [Badalyan] That is what it was. The Communist Party is 
functioning. The draft of the constitution prepared by the 
Communists has been published along with the government draft 
and is being submitted for discussion. The Bureau of the 
Communist Party of Armenia Central Committee officially stated 
that we reject the destructive policy of privatization aimed at 
plundering the national wealth, and that the Communist Party 
will continue to fight for the restoration and strengthening of 
a socialist economy in the republic. 
  [Nikiforova] This statement undoubtedly will play its role. 
But if a party is not in power, let us be honest, its ability to 
influence the outcome of state issues is small. 
  [Badalyan] This is our pain. But here is what we are certain 
of: No one party can currently pull the republic out of the 
crisis. What is needed is a bloc supported by a majority of the 
population. To save the country and the people we are willing to 
form an alliance with all forces in opposition to the 
government. The people's situation is catastrophic: The minimum 
wage or pension is not enough to buy 10 eggs or a glass of 
kerosene. Electricity is turned on for half an hour a day, and 
even then not every day. The main nutrition staple is bread, but 
it is rationed at 350 grams a day per person. In Armenia, the 
first among the Soviet republics that began privatization of the 
land, with our dearth of land, where each square meter is worth 
its weight in gold, half of it is not cultivated! In some 
regions people say: They did not give land to the farmers--they 
buried the farmers in it. And when our prime minister 
pontificates that this is the highest achievement, that by this 
we have "rooted out the foundations for the restoration of this 
disgusting socialism," people do not even laugh anymore. Where 
they used to grow 40 quintals of grain per hectare of 
kolkhoz-sovkhoz land, the tired farmer now gathers two or 
three--less than he had sown. So much effort has been expended 
to berate the broad integration of the republic economy, and 
what do we have as a result? In Ararat valley, farmers are 
chopping down the best vines and sowing wheat so that they can 
feed their families! But famine will soon reach the countryside, 
too. Prosperous Yerevan is turning into a cemetery of a city, 
where bright lights are burning in only one building--the 
American Embassy. 
  [Nikiforova] I saw a brief report recently that oil and gas 
have been found in Armenia. Perhaps this will save it? 
  [Badalyan] This still has to be verified, because this 
report 
came out right after the one on reactivating the nuclear power 
station, which is being done by Russia. The Americans cannot 
fail to notice that the queue at their embassy is much shorter 
than the one at the Russian Embassy, although this does not make 
us happy either. Eighty-five percent of the population support a 
restoration of the closest possible union with Russia. We, 
Communists, have all the grounds to maintain that the road 
chosen by Armenian Bolsheviks at the beginning of 1920's was the 
correct one. Now the anti-Communists, too, are denouncing the 
missionaries and admitting that they did not at all want the 
Soviet Union to disintegrate. Therefore, interest in Russia, in 
the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, is growing now. 
Its success in the elections was cheered as if it were our own. 
You will not believe it, but people here followed the 
Communists' campaign. They discussed not only what the 
candidates said but how, for instance, Gennadiy Zyuganov looked. 
They would get upset if it suddenly appeared that he was not 
answering his opponents as convincingly as he could. They 
grieved because during the October events the opposing side was 
able to outwit and deceive the defenders of the constitution. 
When we learned of the upcoming plenum of the Central Executive 
Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the 
bureau decided that we had to attend, although we did not have 
any money. We found some, with difficulty. We have the same kind 
of work ahead of us, and therefore the experience of our Russian 
comrades is very valuable for us. 
  [Nikiforova] Sergey Grigoryevich, how are your current work 
conditions? 
  [Badalyan] Very difficult. But I am already used to it. The 
constant sense of danger--I travel to regions where shooting 
goes on from time to time. I always find friends to go with me. 
But I cannot step down. I only ask my comrades: If anything 
happens to me, please do not forget my family. 
  [Nikiforova] Has the party organization increased over the 
past year? 
  [Badalyan] There has been some increase, although not as 
significant as we would want. Of 48 city and rayon committees, 
36 have been restored; the rest are in border areas where 
military operations are going on. 
  [Nikiforova] In the past, the foundation of the party were 
the workers. Does the Communist Party of Armenia have any plans 
to increase its work in production collectives? 
  [Badalyan] We have plans. It is opportunities that we are 
short on. Many enterprises--95 percent of them--are closed. But 
we sense that the situation is becoming hot. In Leninakan, for 
instance, there is now talk about strikes. We try to help 
formulate economic demands. People may be deceived for a while 
by vouchers, but they remember that there used to be free 
education and medical care, that children went to pioneer camps 
in the summer and people themselves went on vacation, to health 
resorts, traveled, went on sightseeing tours. In short, they had 
confidence in tomorrow. Now the workers have lost all of it! 
  The Communists wrote in their draft of the constitution that 
we support all-people's state property and social guarantees 
that only socialism can ensure. And the mechanism for 
implementation of this are the soviets. People remember this and 
see where the rejection of socialism has brought us. You know, I 
remember the words of the great writer and artist Rockwell Kent. 
When he was asked "Where is the most wondrous place?" he 
replied: "Go to Armenia!" He was speaking of Soviet Armenia! 
Today all one can see in Armenia is the ruin and pain brought 
upon us by pseudo-democrats. President Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
reassures us: The people agree, he says, because they are 
silent. A dangerous delusion! I am afraid that the silence may 
lead to a terrible social explosion. That is why we demand: 
Surrender your authority; do not push the people to the brink of 
tragedy. The fateful question has already been raised in the 
parliament: "Can the state finally take upon itself the supply, 
distribution, and regulation of prices, in order to put an end 
to the economic disaster?" "Yes, it can," said the prime 
minister, "but this will be a Communist government." 
  And he is right. I want to hope that we will be able to 
repeat Rockwell Kent's wonderful phrase in the near future.

<F P=106> [Report by Armen Khanbabyan under the rubric "Armenia": "Who </F>
Killed the Former Chairman of the Republic KGB: Minister of 
Internal Affairs Accuses Lubyanka"] 
  [Text] Armenian Minister of Internal Affairs Vano 
Siragedyan held a press conference on 25 January. In particular, 
in answering the question as to what he thinks about the recent 
elimination of the State National Security Administration of 
Armenia and fundamental reorganization of the special services, 
Vano Siragedyan said that overall this is a positive development 
and emphasized that as a result of such a reorganization perhaps 
a serious investigation will be opened into the case of the 
murder last year of the former chairman of the Armenian KGB, 
General Marius Yuzbashyan, and of a number of crimes committed 
in similar style. Vano Siragedyan did not rule out that General 
Yuzbashyan had been eliminated by specialists of the former USSR 
KGB, since this crime was organized very professionally. For 
instance, the general was killed with one shot, but several 
spent cartridges were left at the scene of the crime in order to 
confuse the real picture of the crime. According to Siragedyan, 
Yuzbashyan knew quite a bit about the period when the processes 
that eventually led to the current situation around 
Nagorno-Karabakh were still at the inception stage. He knew who 
was acting and how, and for this reason alone could become an 
undesirable and stand in the way of certain forces in Moscow. 
  In addition, the Armenian minister of internal affairs 
dwelled on the accusations leveled against him by a well-known 
Moscow businessman, Serzh Dzhilavyan. Let us recall that 
Dzhilavyan recently accused Vano Siragedyan of allegedly wanting 
to organize his assassination. Siragedyan, in turn, remarked 
that he has no intention of responding to such accusations, 
because doing so would mean making a sort of political figure 
out of a complete nonentity, which is what, in the minister's 
opinion, the Moscow businessman is. At the same time, Siragedyan 
said: "By making these sort of statements and accusations the 
Moscow businessman has committed a very serious mistake. Sooner 
or later he will be killed, either by creditors or by mafiosi 
which make up this man's circle. Nobody in Russia, however, will 
look for them or investigate the matter," said the minister, 
"because Dzhilavyan himself has already pointed in the direction 
of the so-called Armenian trail. After that, it is unlikely that 
anybody would seriously look into his case when Dzhilavyan is 
indeed killed by mafiosi."

<F P=106> ["Statement of the Press Office of the President of the </F>
Azerbaijan Republic"] 
  [Text] Opposition newspapers have recently mounted a 
wide-ranging campaign of slander, tittle-tattle, and insults, 
publishing material full of unsubstantiated accusations. 
Ignoring or observing with reluctance the principles of 
democracy and violating legal and ethic standards in every 
possible way, the opposition newspapers are by their mendacious 
and trashy articles engendering among people a decadent mood and 
seriously damaging the on-going work on the organization of 
military mobilization. 
  One of these newspapers--525TH GAZETA--which, divorced from 
reality completely, aims at sowing panic and fear among the 
populace and forcing people living in the border areas to 
abandon their homes. In the 20 November issue 525TH GAZETA 
writes: "The fate of the other districts awaits Agdzhabedinskiy, 
Terterskiy, Bardinskiy, Beylyaganskiy, Gyandzhinskiy, 
Khanlarskiy, Gazakhskiy, and Tovuzskiy Rayons." The newspaper 
goes on to report some mass exterminations, appalling dangers, 
earthquakes, and unknown diseases that will come crashing down 
on people. 
  The intentions of 525TH GAZETA, which fills the pages of the 
publication with rumors and information totally unsupported by 
any facts, are clear. Could there be a greater provocation in a 
country with more than a million refugees, in a country with 
devastated cities and villages? What name can we give attempts 
to incite people to leave their homes and make them refugees? 
Could there be any greater treachery? 
  It is well known what forces are behind 525TH GAZETA, which 
is filling its pages with rumors and giving itself over to 
verbal rhetoric, in the race for a sensation sacrificing such 
eternal concepts as "Motherland" and "Land." In order to seize 
power these forces are espousing the ugliest propaganda methods. 
  At a meeting with leaders of political parties Geydar 
Aliyev, 
president of the Azerbaijan Republic, publicly exposed the dirty 
intentions of the opposition papers and called on them to embark 
on the path of truth. In order to conduct a decisive struggle 
against the aggressor and to restore our land, which is under 
the heel of the enemy, G.A. Aliyev declared, the news media 
should regard it as their main task to support and bolster the 
fighting spirit of the people, who have risen to the defense of 
their land. Everyone should now be serving this main goal and 
calling on the people by intelligent and truthful words for 
unity. 
  The Press Office of the President of the Azerbaijan Republic 
expresses an emphatic protest against all publications of a 
provocative nature carried in the opposition newspapers, 
including 525TH GAZETA.

<F P=106> [Article by Eldar Zeyna: The Blank Spots Where Material Was </F>
Removed: A Few Words on the Free Press in Azerbaijan"] 
  [Text] If one talks about Azerbaijan as an independent 
state, it is first and foremost a republic that is independent 
of the standards of an independent state. 
  In the third year of Azerbaijan's "independent" existence, 
there is no new constitution, no law on citizenship (all the 
rest of the laws written for Azerbaijan's citizens are, as a 
result, turning into a code) and no passport. It has no 
legitimate parliament (the National Assembly is functioning 
instead, with a five-fold smaller staff) and only in the sixth 
year of the war did it begin to build a regular army. Is it any 
wonder, after this, that the activity of censorship -- that 
age-old scourge of the "fourth power" -- is not regulated by 
legislation? 
  No, though of course, some National Assembly acts about 
censorship do exist. For example, in the autumn of 1992, the 
"Law on Mass Information Media" was passed, and one of its 
points is direct prohibition of censorship of the press (the 
explanation of relations with the state through the court is 
proposed). For some time after this, the role of censor was 
played by Iskender Gamidov, the indefatigable minister of 
Internal Affairs, who would pace up and down the editorial 
offices and, with his own hands, beat up the editors of 
newspapers that had wronged the People's Front (ZERKALO, 
AYDYNLYG, ISTIGLAL). 
  By 2 April 1993, however, the government, without beating 
about the bush, had introduced a state of emergency and 
reinstated political and military censorship. In this period the 
publication of the newspapers ISTIGLAL, SABAKH and GYZYLBASH was 
shut down, and the type pages of the opposition newspapers were 
"adorned" with the blank spaces left from the material that had 
been cut. 
  On the whole, the shift in power in June 1993 had no effect 
on the situation: censorship was retained all the same (the new 
powers thoughtfully extended the state of emergency introduced 
by their predecessors), it was just that the group of "lads for 
flogging," in which the former pro-government newspapers found 
themselves, was changed. The case is recalled, for example, 
when, last summer, a piece was removed from the reprinted 
newspaper AZADLYG, and from some reference book for the 
biography of Geydar Aliyev, at that time speaker of parliament 
(now the president). The piece pertained to his former 
chairmanship in the KGB and membership in the CPSU Central 
Committee Politburo. A whole chunk of his life was removed 
(which, incidentally, did not overly burden Aliyev himself). 
  Then not long ago, in January, a few paragraphs from S. 
Talbott's September report before the United States Senate 
Foreign Affairs Committee, with an account of that country's 
official position on the change of power in Azerbaijan, were 
removed from the newspaper ISTIGLAL. It took this newspaper two 
months of battling with the censorship and an appeal of the 
"Helsinki Watch" to G. Aliyev, for the "Amnesty International" 
report on the state of human rights in Azerbaijan in 1992 (!) to 
be passed through. 
  The thing is, censorship is constructed according to the old 
Soviet model of "inside-out glasnost": let the whole world know, 
but just don't corrupt the domestic reader. Censorship can be 
understood in some places: after all, there is so far no law on 
censorship which would regulate its relations with the press and 
the government, and no list of the state and military secrets 
which formerly existed in almost every state office. One has to 
work in the old way, primarily aimed at not offending the "first 
person" of the state in any way. 
  The situation did not change with the September canceling of 
the state of emergency, along with political (but not military) 
censorship, nor with the December passage by the National 
Assembly, in response to the grumbling of the press, of a 
special decree forbidding politicians to engage in censorship. 
  The only innovation is a particularly feeble one forbidding 
the newspapers now to leave the blank spots left from the 
materials removed, and making them fill them in with something 
loyal or bring the lines together. "Or else, you see, those 
abroad will think that our country has censorship and no 
democracy," the censor requiring this ingenuously explained to 
one of my friends. 
  The present regime is in general beneficially distinguished 
from the preceding "democrats" by its greater sensitivity to 
world public opinion. This is, in my opinion, the only effective 
means of pressure on the regime in the direction of liberalizing 
the attitude toward the independent press. The government's 
counteracting of this liberalization is mainly along the line of 
strong "educating" of the press, in order for the president to 
subordinate to himself personally both the censorship and the 
only newspaper publishing house, "Azerbaijan." On the one hand, 
the censor explains "that such-and-such is good and 
such-and-such is bad," and on the other hand -- the publishing 
house sets up an obstacle to unpleasing newspapers. It takes no 
special art to do this, incidentally, when one considers the 
difficulties experienced by the independent press, as compared 
with the government press, when it is based on self-provision 
with metal plates, paper and the rest of the things necessary 
for printing, 95 percent located in another sovereign state 
(Russia), with which bank and transport relations are 
complicated. 
  All the newspapers of Azerbaijan are now in debt, except 
perhaps the government-subsidized "officiosa." But while in 
Russia private enterprises and banks can subsidize a certain 
political group without being afraid that the road to normal 
activity will be cut off to them, in Azerbaijan this is fraught 
with major troubles. So it is not by chance that Etibar Mamedov, 
chairman of the National Independence Party, stormed into 
parliament on learning that they wanted to check the account of 
his party newspaper, MILLYAT, to find out the channels by which 
money was arriving. 
  If one considers the fact that AZADLYG, the newspaper of the 
People's Front, at the time when the PFA [People's Front of 
Azerbaijan] was in power, managed not only to make ends meet, 
but to lease an entire building, buy computers and even 
subsidize the holding of two PFA congresses, then the 
information that, through the raykoms of the "Yeni (New) 
Azerbaijan Party," headed by the president, certain major 
enterprises alluded to the need for donations to the party organ 
of the same name does not seem all that groundless. 
  Having been contributing to the independent press for four 
years now and having survived several introductions and 
cancellations of censorship and five changes of power, I can 
with full responsibility summarize that after a certain 
temporary ebb, each of these changes has led to even greater 
"screw-tightening" with respect to the press which is 
independent of the government (and the ruling party). 
Concentrating censorship and the press media in the same hands 
and persistently expressing, in the pro-government press, the 
idea that "a state at war does not need hundreds of newspapers" 
-- all that cannot help but put one on guard. 
  The striving for monopoly over the printed word is not the 
casual whim of a certain specific ruler, but the expression of 
the general striving of a pleiad of "fathers of the nation," 
replacing each other in Azerbaijan, toward political monopoly 
(it is not by chance that they call the press the "fourth 
power"). The press is an irritant, damaging the false democratic 
image of the government, and at the same time it is very 
vulnerable, particularly in a post-totalitarian state such as 
Azerbaijan. The treatment of the mass information media may 
therefore be regarded as a barometer of the moods of any 
specific government. 
  These are the abc's, and therefore, when the West, which has 
tantalized us with the delights of its democracy for dozens of 
years, is now shamefully ignoring the obvious anti-democratic 
trends in the attitude of a certain specific government of 
Azerbaijan toward the press, ascribing this sometimes to the war 
and sometimes to the infancy of our democracy, I am inclined to 
regard it as assumed naivete. Well, the government of the 
People's Front cannot be national and democratic if its minister 
beats up journalists, and the president, in response to the 
complaints, promises to add to this with the help of the court! 
  The smell of the Caspian oil, which both regimes promised 
the 
West, has clearly dispelled its feeling for the recurrences of 
totalitarianism. But really, from whom can we ask and expect 
help, if not from the West? Several Western petroleum companies 
have representatives in the republic, but not a single 
department of democratic funds or institutions, which in itself 
shows the direction of the West's interests. 
  In this connection, the story comes to mind of one of the 
American presidents who reconciled himself to the arbitrary rule 
of a Latin American dictator, because he was "his own son of a 
bitch." The United States had no fewer problems with this 
country (Nicaragua) because of this approach, and in the end a 
revolution broke out, and this error in reckoning will echo for 
a long time. So is it not simpler (and cheaper, in the long run) 
to develop democracy in Azerbaijan instead of implanting "our 
own" dictators?

<F P=106> [Article by Liana Minasyan: "The Number of `Third Forces' </F>
Participating in the Conflict Is Increasing; Azerbaijan Is Using 
the Negotiations for Maneuvering"] 
  [Text] Every new outbreak of battles in Nagorno-Karabakh 
demonstrates that the number of "third forces" participating in 
the conflict is increasing. And this is natural, inasmuch as the 
authorities of Azerbaijan who successively replaced each other, 
given the outward dissimilarity of their political form, 
differed very little in their attitude toward the Karabakh 
problem, adhering to one logic--war. True, a revealing 
metamorphosis has taken place: Ayaz Mutalibov, who did not 
consider it possible to create his own combat-capable army in a 
short time, stressed resources at hand--the remainder of the 
Soviet troops in Azerbaijan. Abulfaz Elchibey was a follower of 
the national idea and, consequently, a supporter of the creation 
of a national army. He organized an offensive, after promising 
in one of his interviews to resolve the problem in a year--and 
Geydar Aliyev repeated the very same words in January of this 
year. He returned to the use of the idea that it was impossible 
to gain a victory in war with one's own forces. But as a more 
flexible politician in the line of his predecessors, he actively 
used peaceful rhetoric. Although the first negotiations by his 
representatives on the dispatch of mujahidin to Azerbaijan were 
going on at the end of the summer and the beginning of 
September, when Aliyev still claimed that he should become 
president first and then engage in peaceful negotiations. 
  The present offensive was being readied since July, but it 
started in December, when Azerbaijan considered that it was 
already prepared for them. A large amount of ammunition was 
received from Russia, all produced in 1993--Aliyev took 
advantage of his contacts with brass hats and the generally 
indefinite situation in Russia. Negotiations were held about the 
mercenaries--both Afghan and Russian--and time was needed for 
all of this. Turkish instructors arrived in Azerbaijan, and 
today Karabakh soldiers are finding Turkish-produced cartridges 
on the battlefield. 
  While the Russian plan for settlement and the CSCE plan were 
being actively worked on, Azerbaijan, while participating in the 
negotiations, maneuvered, and when it was necessary ignored them 
in order to avoid a determinant and far-reaching decision. It 
needed a victory more than it needed negotiations, inasmuch as 
the initial position for the start of political bargaining was 
less than advantageous. Therefore, a declared armistice was 
broken more than once. The concept arose in Russian diplomatic 
circles of "limited military victories" that were necessary to 
Azerbaijan--incentives that could incline it to accept the 
Russian settlement plan (up until now, Baku in one or another 
form reported its objection to it). 
  Azerbaijan tried to use the potential support of Iran, 
Turkey, and Russia, showing that it was acting in their 
contradictory, however, interests. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has 
already written about the facts of the participation of Afghan 
mujahidin in combat operations on its side. Documents, whose 
originals were transferred to the editorial office, were found 
on dead Afghans on the battlefield. In particular, a list of 
personnel of one of the subunits of the training center in 
Gyandzh consists only of mujahidin. Here are names: Abdurrazak 
Mukhamatrasul, Zakhedulla Muminkhan, Abdulvakil Mukhamadkarim, 
Gulzada Sardar, Alikhaydar Shakhmukhamat, Gulakhmat Mirrakhman, 
Khanshirin, [preceding names as transliterated] and others. As 
follows from the September information report on the 
military-political situation in the region by the commander of 
military unit No. 160, Lieutenant Colonel Lyatifov, in which 
Afghans are fighting, "the military unit is deployed on the 
territory of Yevlakhskiy Rayon. The closest populated centers 
are the Geran Station, Geranboyskiy Rayon, the city of 
Mingechaur... A special contingent is located in our unit, they 
are combat motivated, and they maintain good relations with us 
and with the local population. They drive out to the cities of 
Mingechaur, Geranboy, and Gyandzha escorted by interpreters who 
are called up for periods of training. Questions that arise with 
the command element of the special contingent are resolved 
successfully. Although it can be noted that the leadership of 
the neighboring rayons does not maintain close contacts with the 
command element of the special contingent in order to furnish 
its assistance at the necessary moment. I would like in the 
future to improve relations with the leadership of the 
neighboring rayons and the command element of the unit. These 
meetings and contacts will have a positive influence on the mood 
of the personnel and will support their combat spirit. No effort 
was seen to plant leaflets and propaganda against the leadership 
of the republic..." 
  The mujahidin, as the Karabakh people acknowledge, fight 
stubbornly, although the motive for their participation in this 
conflict is not religious convictions, but strictly pragmatic 
considerations. According to unconfirmed reports, the Afghans 
began to be actively used after the son-in-law of Prime Minister 
Hekmatyar, together with a representative of his current 
ally--General Dostam--visited Baku in the middle of December. 
  This problem was commented on for NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA by 
Feliks Mamikoyan, the permanent representative of Armenia in 
Russia: 
  "According to the protocol to the treaty on collective 
security, to join it requires the consent of all of the country 
participants. Azerbaijan expressed a desire to sign the treaty, 
but juridically its entry has not yet been ratified in the 
prescribed procedures. Several questions arise in this 
connection--in particular concerning the Iran-Azerbaijan border. 
Inasmuch as individual borders of the CIS, in contrast to the 
`transparent' internal borders, must be protected, then the 
Iranian border also cannot be outwardly open--otherwise a threat 
emerges for all states, particularly for Armenia. The threat is 
associated with the participation of third-country servicemen in 
a local conflict on the territory of Azerbaijan--which is one of 
the members of the CIS. 
  "Considering the complicated situation on the Afghan-Tajik 
border, on whose different sides a combined CIS contingent and 
those mujahidin are deployed, this fact looks even more 
ambiguous and requires clarification. As does Aliyev's 
persistent reluctance to protect his outer border with Iran. If 
an agreement should be written that the Russian border troops of 
the combined CIS contingent is to take control of the border, 
the Karabakh authorities are prepared to release these 
territories--they have repeatedly declared that they do not plan 
to retain these lands. In the context of peaceful negotiations, 
the question of stationing Russian border troops along this line 
can become one of the most important. 
  "We have information that makes it possible to reach 
conclusions, in particular, about the fact that the Iranian 
border was used for operations of the Azerbaijan army. In the 
first stage, the success of the operation on the southern front 
is explained by the fact that the troops got into the rear of 
the Karabakh armed formations through the Iranian border. This 
once again confirms the need for common border troops that 
control the borders of the Commonwealth--then it would be 
possible to avoid reproaches of this kind."

<F P=106> [Article by Samed Mansurov: "In War as in War"] </F>
  [Text] I was here before the war and my recollections 
connected with peaceful Karabakh are beautiful. Today, however, 
they are only recollections. There is no return to the past, as 
there is no road to Agdam, which, in fact, has also not existed 
for several months. 
  We turn in the direction of the headquarters of the Agdam 
brigade. Regular buses taken off routes for soldiers' 
transportation pass on the road. Tomorrow a young replacement 
will join the battle. The column of the battalion medical 
station, which has thundered past us in the direction of the 
front line, smells of war. The buses remind us of the city. 
  In the barracks of the Agdam brigade, officers sleep on the 
floor and soldiers have forgotten what bed linen and blankets 
are. After a meager supper in the soldiers' mess one does not 
want to think about anything else but sleep. Here, at the very 
front line, this is a luxury, because the lice, with which the 
barracks are teeming, are not asleep. 
  In this war senseless victims (if, in general, it is 
appropriate to talk about any sense) are in the order of things. 
On the Azerbaijani side up to 90 percent of the losses are the 
consequence of the low level of combat training of both soldiers 
and officers. One colonel complained to me that from among the 
commanders subordinate to him no one knew how to handle even a 
compass. Despair is heard in the voice of the former Soviet Army 
officer, an Azerbaijani, who has served in Ukraine for 20 years. 
  Things are even worse with soldiers. Adolescents, who have 
barely left school, receive weapons almost in trenches. If a 
cartridge suddenly becomes wedged in the barrel during combat, 
the weapon becomes a useless piece of iron, because no one has 
taught the soldier how to take the Kalashnikov assault rifle 
apart and clean it. After the command "attack" soldiers maintain 
the correct direction of motion for no more than about 10 meters 
and then disperse in different directions like blind cats. 
  We arrived at the front line before the very beginning of 
the 
Armenian attack. The enemy tank was stopped one meter from the 
defense line--it almost overran the trench. A grenade hit the 
track and the T-72 rolled back downhill. If not for this lucky 
accident, both the defenders and we, journalists, would be in a 
bad way. Later soldiers tried to determine who fired more 
accurately. The most accurate grenade launcher operator can 
expect a reward of 2 million rubles. 
  What even the youngest cannot be denied is the desire to 
win. 
However, desire alone is not enough. "It is easy to be killed 
and this is by no means always heroism," says a young 
lieutenant--a battalion commander. "A soldier deserves more 
glory if he wins and remains alive." He did not want to remember 
how a unit of the second battalion tried to leave the position 
during the attack. The commander stopped them with shots into 
the air. 
  Soldiers are killed not only in combat. Quite recently 27 
young combat engineers were blown up on an antitank mine during 
a training exercise. The commander explained to them the 
principle of fuse operation and forgot that in front of him 
there was a real, not training, mine. My friend was killed last 
year: during dinner the barracks was wiped off the face of the 
earth, because someone carelessly unloaded ammunition nearby. 
  Some battalions have been sitting in trenches since the 
summer of 1993, when Armenian forces scored several crushing 
victories in succession. The offensive was stopped thanks to a 
corps of Afghan mujahidin. In the middle of January of this year 
Afghans also liberated Goradiz, a strategically important 
station on the Iranian-Azerbaijani border. Mujahidin act 
autonomously, coordinating only the most necessary details with 
the Azerbaijani command. An Afghan soldier receives up to 10,000 
U.S. dollars per month. Legends are composed about mujahidin in 
Beylagan, where their headquarters are located. People say that 
one Tajik-Afghan (the majority of those fighting in Azerbaijan 
are Tajiks) can handle a tank: he jumps up onto the armor with a 
pail of dirt and blocks its vision devices. The subsequent 
extraction of the crew from the tank is a technical matter. 
Mujahidin bring prisoners from missions in packs. If they seize 
Russians fighting on the Armenian side, they do not hand them 
over to the Azerbaijani military. Afghans have iron discipline, 
although they scorn conventions such as uniforms, drill 
training, and so forth. On a road in Beylagan we picked up four 
mujahidin, who mastered the Azerbaijani language to such an 
extent that they were able to explain where to bring them and to 
thank us at parting. The day before our 25-year old traveling 
companions seized Goradiz. An Azerbaijani girl, who was a 
medical corpswoman, told me later that several corpses of women 
snipers--according to rumors, either Lithuanians or French--were 
found in the city ruins. All the women's throats were cut. "One 
of them had very beautiful hair," the girl said. After this 
story the driver of the microbus refused to drive us to Goradiz. 
  After the series of defeats last year the desertion of 
Azerbaijani soldiers assumed a catastrophic scale. President 
Aliyev's edict promised amnesty to those who ran away if they 
returned to their units before 10 January 1994. A few days 
before the expiration of this date crowds of deserters and their 
parents gathered in front of the entrance to the Ministry of 
Defense in Baku, trying to find out in the personnel 
administration where the units were located. The number of those 
who repented tripled after the decree of the military tribunal, 
which sentenced two deserters to execution by a firing squad, 
was published in the Azerbaijani press. 
  The prospects for the return of deserters do not gladden 
soldiers. The fighters think that, having ran away once, they 
will also ran away for the second and third time. "When the war 
ends, I am sure to meet one of them," says the bearded sergeant 
with a bandaged head. "I know what I will do then... If I remain 
alive." Soldiers in trenches do not consider deserters to be 
Azerbaijanis. 
  With the exception of several elite subdivisions in the 
Azerbaijani National Army there are no units capable of 
performing serious combat missions. Assault battalions and 
special forces, basically, consist of professional servicemen, 
former members of the special-purpose militia detachment. They 
are too few to alter the course of the war in a short time and 
to forget about the most serious destruction of Azerbaijani 
arms, which has led to a revision of the political course and 
change of the republic's leadership. 
  Moscow has never denied that the Transcaucasus is a zone of 
special interests of Russian foreign policy. However, until now 
Russian politicians have not brought themselves to acknowledge 
their indirect (or direct) participation in the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani war. Meanwhile, Russia's military aid to 
Armenia has never been a secret to those let in on it. In 
Yerevan the seventh combined-arms army of Russia's Armed Forces, 
which was later transformed into three mobile brigades modeled 
after American quick-response forces, was used either as a 
shield, or according to the direct purpose. Suffice it to recall 
the tank attack on Fizuli and the bombing of Azerbaijani 
settlements from the air by aircraft, which Armenia does not 
have. 
  With Aliyev's coming to power Baku's situation seemingly has 
changed for the better. A draft of the Azerbaijani-Russian 
agreement on military cooperation, which, probably, will be 
signed in the very near future, has caught my eyes. A compromise 
has finally been reached on the matter of joint operation of the 
former Soviet--and now no man's--center of radioelectronic 
reconnaissance in Gabal in the north of Azerbaijan, which is the 
largest in Europe. In exchange for concessions Russia 
transferred to Azerbaijan several dozens of the latest 
"Shturm-S" antitank systems and, at the same time, specialists 
as well, who will teach Azerbaijani servicemen how to handle 
fine equipment. The results of backstage negotiations between 
Azerbaijani political leaders and the Russian military will make 
themselves felt in spring, when the weather makes it possible to 
activate combat operations around Karabakh. 
  In all, about 100 Russian military specialists now serve 
under contract in the Azerbaijani Army. Most of them have 
arrived here at the beginning of the current year. This is the 
result of the secret mission, on which a group of Azerbaijani 
recruiting officers departed from Baku to Russia at the end of 
December 1993. In the military commissariats of Moscow, Ivanovo, 
Yaroslavl, Nizhniy Novgorod, and other Russian cities 
Azerbaijanis obtained access to the service records of reserve 
servicemen: some of them agreed to serve in the Azerbaijani 
Army. The republic's armed forces are experiencing an acute 
shortage of air defense, artillery, and other specialists. 
Russian military specialists do not (or hardly) take part in 
combat operations. 
  Nadzhmedlin Sadykhov, chief of the General Staff of the 
Azerbaijani National Army, is surrounded by Russian military 
specialists. Colonel Aleksandr Vasyak, chief of the Operations 
Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, who was invited from 
Russia, formulates and directs the activities of the Azerbaijani 
Army all over the front. At the headquarters of the Agdam 
brigade, Colonel Vasyak's eloquent expressions before a 
formation of Azerbaijani officers about the lackadaisical 
attitude of the latter made me give up the idea of asking the 
colonel a few questions. 
  Major Gribanov, chief of staff of x-brigade, came to 
Azerbaijan from Murmansk, leaving his wife and three children 
there. He is fighting for his homeland. The Russian major 
considers it to be Azerbaijan, where he has lived for more than 
1 year. Mikhail Vasilyevich says: "I am the same Azerbaijani as 
all of them. Sometimes I tell my children that I am a better 
Moslem than they are, although I am not circumcised. If 
necessary, I will die here."

  [Text] 
Tbilisi-Marneuli-Dmanisi-Bolnisi-Tbilisi-Baku--As the 
press has already reported, a delegation of the Azerbaijan 
Republic headed by State Secretary Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva 
visited Georgia recently to familiarize itself with the living 
conditions and problems of Azerbaijanis who reside in the 
neighboring republic. The delegation was met at Tbilisi Airport 
by Vakhtang Rcheulishvili, deputy chairman of the Georgian 
parliament, Niko Lekishvili, mayor of the city of Tbilisi, and 
other officials. 
  The itinerary of the Azerbaijani delegation's trip to 
Georgia 
was changed at Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva's request. The program 
had originally featured only Marneulskiy District, where, to 
judge by information received, the crime situation has 
deteriorated sharply. But before visiting Marneuli, L.-Sh. 
Gadzhiyeva expressed a desire to visit highland Dmanisskiy 
District, which is more remote from the center and where also 
Azerbaijanis live under compact conditions. 
  And so, having negotiated more than 100 km along 
snow-covered 
winding mountain roads and having bypassed the district center 
of Dmanisi, the chain of cars entered the Azerbaijani village of 
Gamarli. Hearing of the arrival of the important visitor from 
Baku, people hurried toward the cars from their nearby homes. 
Lala khanum was tightly ringed by local inhabitants. Announcing 
the purpose of her visit, the state secretary asked all the 
villagers to meet at the local clubhouse for a comprehensive 
discussion. 
  There were more than enough people wishing to have their 
say--a multitude of urgent problems has accumulated in the 
village and the district. Those in the hall were mainly women, 
children, and the elderly. As we were told later, there are 
hardly any young people left in this village, as in the 
surrounding Azerbaijani villages--there is no work here, and for 
this reason they prefer to make their way to Baku or settle on 
the boundless expanses of the former Union--mainly in Siberia, 
in the Urals, and in the central zone of Russia, where there is 
a need for manpower. 
  Azerbaijanis once accounted for 70 percent of the population 
of the district center of Dmanisi. Now 20-30 homes remain here, 
at the most. The villages of Muganly, Saatly, Salamelik, 
Guseyn-kendi, Sadzha, and Yyrgandzhak are completely empty. The 
bare sockets of windows gape open in 70 homes--more than 
half!--in Gamarli itself. Whereas several years ago Azerbaijanis 
were leaving Georgia in no great hurry--they would sell their 
homes and carry what they had earned over a long life to their 
new place of residence--now they frequently leave without 
luggage, and their departure is reminiscent more of flight. Why? 
The answers are to be found in the bitter confessions of the 
inhabitants of the village of Gamarli.... 
  From the speech of Vagif Abdulayev: 
  "I was employed for a long time in the district soviet 
executive committee as head of the Labor Department, and in the 
executive committee itself, as in the district party committee, 
more than 70 percent of the employees were Azerbaijanis. An 
ethnic cleansing campaign began after 1989. All persons of 
Azerbaijani nationality were dismissed from their jobs at that 
time--hospital attendants and cleaners included. Some 122 
Azerbaijani drivers worked at the district machinery and tractor 
pool, now not one is left! Gangs of cutthroats are active in the 
district: they are rustling livestock, robbing homes, and taking 
people hostage. The Svany, who have moved here from the mountain 
areas, and also the Armenians, who live nearby, are 
distinguished by particular brutality in their attacks on the 
village and attempts on the life of the inhabitants. We have 
nothing with which to defend our families: We have had to hand 
over in exchange for a receipt even our hunting rifles...." 
  From the account of Gamid Nasibov, inhabitant of 
the village of Gamarli: 
  "Georgia is our homeland. The graves of our ancestors are 
here, this is our ancestral home. Until recently we lived with 
the Georgians like brothers--we shared our joys and sorrows. But 
these are different times, and we are being driven, under the 
threat of death, out of hearth and home...." 
  From the account of the 70-year-old Khadzhar 
Askerova, an inhabitant of the village of Garabulag: 
  "There are nine children in our family. How are we to feed 
them? The village store has not had a thing for three years now. 
We go 30 km to the district center and stand in line all night, 
and we often cannot even get a loaf of bread. We are told: `You 
are Azerbaijanis, go back where you came from. We don't have 
enough to feed our own.' Today I was in luck (she shows us two 
small gray hunks of bread--rock-hard to the touch and 
inedible)--I came by them somehow. The assistant asked 600 
coupons for them (although bread was still 50 coupons a loaf at 
that time)...." 
  The stream of grievances and complaints about the hard life, 
the lack of bread, heating, jobs, and the total social and legal 
lack of protection was endless. We also saw those who were the 
casualties of aggravated assaults. An 18-year-old girl had been 
shot through the arm, and the bullet is still lodged in her 
body. Her friend was wounded also. A bullet smashed the leg of a 
kolkhoz tractor driver, and it had to be amputated because of 
the danger of blood infection. All three were wounded by one and 
the same person--the deputy director of a neighboring 
sovkhoz--when they were returning home from work in the fields. 
Unfortunately, the criminal, who caused three innocent people to 
suffer, is still at liberty. And a multitude of examples of such 
impunity could be cited, according to the inhabitants of the 
village of Gamarli. 
  In the neighboring village of Yagublu we were told an even 
scarier story of how gangsters took hostage a local inhabitant 
by the name of Bayramov. They demanded a huge ransom, and in 
order to get him to own up where the money was kept they bound 
the victim and ran a red-hot iron along his bare back. Finding 
the torture unendurable, the poor fellow died. 
  During the meeting with local inhabitants in the village of 
Yagublu the state secretary was approached by the representative 
of the parliament of Georgia in Dmanisskiy District. The crowd 
politely gave way to let him through. "Listen to him. He is a 
just man and understands us," voices were heard from all over. 
Aleksandr Skachkov spoke long and convincingly: 
  "Unless decisive measures are adopted at the level of the 
Georgian leadership, the situation could get out of control and 
become unpredictable. Dmanisskiy District has long been a no 
man's land abandoned to the whim of fate. Local authorities 
virtually do not exist. Mafia structures and gangs are the real 
master of the district. Serious crimes--homicides, rape, and 
abduction--are committed on the territory of Dmanisi daily. 
Fifteen people have been abducted this year alone. And 80-90 
percent of the crimes committed in the district are directed 
here against persons of Azerbaijani nationality. And this means 
that the mafia is being backed by certain forces which are 
attempting to incite interethnic conflict between Azerbaijanis 
and Georgians. God grant the Dmanisskiye Azerbaijanis good 
health: They are law-abiding and very patient. It is thanks only 
to these qualities of theirs that the nationality issue has not 
been raised once here." 
  All the above-mentioned difficulties are prompting the 
people 
of Dmanisi to a mass exodus from Georgia. The mentality of 
refugees has, unfortunately, taken hold in those who are still 
holding on to their native hearths. "Give us refugee status. We 
have lost this land; no matter what, we can't go on living here! 
We are prepared to starve and live in tents, just as long as we 
can get away from here," the state secretary was told in Dmanisi. 
  Addressing the people, both State Secretary L.-Sh. 
Gadzhiyeva 
and the deputy speaker of the Georgian parliament emphasized the 
impermissibility of the inflammation of this mood. Vakhtang 
Rcheulishvili observed that on the territory of Dmanisskiy 
District the law enforcement authorities had uncovered a 150-man 
gang and that every measure would be adopted very soon to 
eliminate it. "A similar situation has come about throughout the 
republic," he said. "I have 34 districts in Georgia, and 
everywhere I hear one and the same thing: no flour, no bread, no 
fuel. A civil war is being fought in Georgia, Georgians are 
killing one another. I understand your pain and share your 
anger. Be patient a little longer, do not leave!" 
  Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva told the local Azerbaijanis the same 
thing. She invariably emphasized in her speeches the idea that 
the problem of the orgy of crime in Dmanisskiy, Marneulskiy, and 
Bolnisskiy districts was a criminal, not political, problem. It 
cannot be allowed to grow to the level of an interethnic 
problem. "The criminal has no faith or nationality. I would 
greatly implore you, therefore, to call criminals criminals and 
never transfer the discussion to the plane of 
Azerbaijani-Georgian relations. Remember that in the 
thousand-year history of cohabitation there have never been 
conflicts between Azerbaijanis and Georgians, even less should 
there be such today. G.A. Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan will 
not permit this, E.A. Shevardnadze will not permit this. A 
policy of national discrimination might have been pursued 
earlier, perhaps, under the former leadership, but the present 
leadership of Georgians is attuned emphatically against 
violations of human rights, against violence...." 
  Leaving Dmanisskiy District, the delegation set off for 
Marneuli, where the state secretary was impatiently awaited by 
thousands of people who had come from all around. The head of 
the Azerbaijani delegation laid a wreath at the foot of the 
monument to Nariman Narimanov, prominent son of our people. A 
crowded meeting was then held in front of the prefecture 
building. 
  Not long before Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva's visit to Georgia, 
criminals had taken five Azerbaijanis hostage. This caused the 
Marneuli people's cup of patience to run over. A demonstration 
lasting many days began in the town square, and eight young 
Azerbaijanis announced an indefinite hunger strike as a sign of 
protest. The protest demonstration and hunger strike had an 
effect: The leadership of the republic intervened, and four 
hostages were released. The fate of Dashdamir Dashdamirov, a 
leaseholder of the Marneulskiy District's village of Gadzhiis, 
remained unknown as of that time. 
  Approximately 130,000 persons live in Marneulskiy District, 
I 
was told by Kamil Kiradzhzili, member of the city council and 
chairman of the Ozan Society. Azerbaijanis constitute about 
100,000 here. Until recently many Azerbaijanis held senior 
positions in both the administrative and law enforcement 
authorities, naturally. Then, with the blessing of Tbilisi 
officialdom, a purge began in the district. And during the rule 
of the Gamsakhurdia regime 37 names of villages were changed in 
the district overnight in an attempt to conceal from posterity 
their primordially Turkic origin. A familiar picture, is it not? 
Did not the campaign to push Azerbaijanis from their 
grandfathers' hearths in Armenia begin this way? 
  There are in the leadership of Georgia today, fortunately, 
different people, who are sincerely concerned at the current 
situation and who are doing everything they can to prevent the 
situation growing to the level of interethnic conflict. They are 
primarily E.A. Shevardnadze, the leader of the Georgian state, 
whom Lala khanum met after the tour of Azerbaijani districts and 
with whom she had a long and comprehensive conversation. She 
concealed nothing from him--she spoke about people's mood, about 
the orgy of crime, and about the fact that people are starving 
and living in poverty and despair. She expressed an impartial 
opinion concerning the head of the executive of Dmanisskiy 
District, who even in the presence of herself and Deputy Speaker 
V. Rcheulishvili behaved rudely and insolently with the local 
population. "You can imagine how he treats the people when there 
are no witnesses present!" 
  Having complained about the total paralysis of power and the 
collapse of the state structures, E. Shevardnadze said the anger 
of the Azerbaijani population was understandable and close to 
him. True, he observed, life is not a bit easier in the areas 
populated by Georgians. "I have just returned from Western 
Georgia. People there are complaining about the same problems." 
Both the state secretary and the Georgian head of state agree 
that, despite the existence of colossal objective difficulties, 
it is essential to make every effort so that people's hopes not 
be deceived. "We are against Azerbaijanis leaving Georgia," E. 
Shevardnadze said. "This is their homeland. However difficult, 
we will restore order and will soon have done with the gangster 
groups in these areas. It just needs for everyone to have a 
little more patience...." 
  Following the negotiations and a head-to-head talk with E.A. 
Shevardnadze, the ceremony of ratification of the Treaty on 
Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Security Between Azerbaijan 
and Georgia took place. The latter was signed by L.-Sh. 
Gadzhiyeva, state secretary of Azerbaijan, and V. Rcheulishvili, 
deputy head of the parliament of Georgia. The ceremony was 
attended by E.A. Shevardnadze and officials of Azerbaijan and 
Georgia. 
  In Tbilisi, Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva and the members of the 
Azerbaijani delegation laid flowers at the spot in the square 
where a monument to the victims of the tragedy of 9 April will 
be erected. 
  Later in the evening the Azerbaijani delegation returned to 
Baku. And two days later I learned that the leadership of 
Azerbaijan had adopted the decision to send the inhabitants of 
the Azerbaijani districts in Georgia vehicles carrying flour and 
fuel. So that it might be easier for them to get through this 
long, harsh winter.

<F P=106> [Interview with A.N. Akhundov, chairman of the board of the </F>
Azerbaijan Industrial-Investment Joint-Stock Commercial Bank, by 
A. Gamedov, VYSHKA economic observer; place and date not given: 
"Life Generates Tactics, or Banks in the Transitional Stage"] 
  [Text] Today many people are dissatisfied with the 
activity of the banks. Some people are inclined to think that 
they are almost the main parties to blame for the production 
slump. It has become a rule of good form to constantly berate 
them, but the bank workers have their reasons which are based on 
a deeper penetration into the economy of the transition stage. 
But in fact how should correct relations be arranged between the 
economic subjects and the banks so as to surmount difficulties 
through joint efforts. 
  This was the topic of a discussion with the chairman of the 
board of the Azerbaijan Industrial-Investment Joint-Stock 
Commercial Bank, A.N. Akhundov. He was born in 1950 and in 1973 
he graduated from the "Finance and Credit" department of the 
Institute of the National Economy, after which he was sent to 
work as a regular credit inspector to the republic Stroybank 
[Construction Bank] office. He went in sequence through all the 
steps of the service ladder. At the end of last year he was 
elected chairman of the board of the joint-stock commercial 
Prominvestbank, which was created on the basis of Promstroybank 
[Industrial Construction Bank]. 
  [Gamedov] Abulfaz Nuruyevich, please tell us about your 
bank's place in the republic's finance-credit system. Why is it 
needed, what are its functions? 
  [Akhundov] Azerbaijan has a two-level banking system. It is 
headed by the National Bank, which is under the jurisdiction of 
the republic National Assembly. The second level is occupied by 
commercial banks. They too are divided into two parts: one is 
made up of joint-stock commercial banks in which the government 
owns controlling blocks of shares. It includes Prominvestbank, 
Agroprombank, the International Bank, and Sberbank. The second 
consists of a large group of purely commercial banks. There is a 
total of about 160 of them. Among the aforementioned credit 
institutions, Prominvestbank has the largest amount of 
authorized capital--it amounts to 4 billion rubles [R]. 
  [Gamedov] What brought about the transformation of your bank 
into a joint-stock commercial bank? 
  [Akhundov] The demands of life, the need to reform the 
economy, its shift to market principles. Among the first legal 
normative acts adopted by the Milli Majlis in 1992 was the Law 
"On Banks and Banking Activity in the Azerbaijan Republic." Our 
bank was transferred into a joint-stock commercial one on its 
basis. 
  Its position in our economy is determined by the fact that 
90 
percent of the industrial enterprises and construction 
organizations, state concerns, joint-stock companies, etc., are 
served by our bank. And they constitute the republic's 
industrial might. 
  Its founders are Agroprombank, the State Fund for Social 
Security of the Population, Sberbank, the state metallurgy 
concerns, Azerigaz, the Ministry of Material Resources, the 
Azglavenergo Production Association, the household air 
conditioner plant, Glavbekstroy, Kaspar, the Khazar Joint-Stock 
Company, the Aran Corporation, and others. 
  The volume of credit investments is R380 billion, which 
amounts to more than half of the credit investments in 
Azerbaijan. We render to our clients the entire complex of 
banking services--accounting-cash operations, credit, and 
consultation, we accept deposits from the population, etc. 
  [Gamedov] According to information available to the 
editorial 
office, the republic has no enterprises, organizations, or 
institutions that are not indebted to one another. What work is 
the bank doing to settle mutual debts among your clients? 
  [Akhundov] Indeed, the labor collectives have borrowed a 
great deal from one another for the delivery of processed 
materials, raw materials, finished products, work performed, and 
services rendered. The sum of these debts as of 1 October was 
more than R150 million. 
  Throughout this year in the system of Prominvestbank the 
offsetting of mutual claims was carried out six times. The sum 
of defaulted debts that were paid came to approximately R250 
million. 
  The effectiveness of the offsetting depends on whether or 
not 
all enterprises, organizations, and institutions, and also 
banks, participate in them. 
  To our great dismay, many enterprises and organizations did 
not participate in the offsetting of claims, except in October, 
and neither did all the banks. There were even cases where the 
leaders of a number of branches who were accustomed to 
complaining about everything and who had arranged in the 
government for conducting the offsetting remained on the 
sidelines as soon as the matter became a part of their practical 
work. Moreover, enterprises and organizations under their 
jurisdiction refused to participate in them. Enterprises of the 
production association Azenergo, of the state concern 
Azerkhimiya, the State Committee on Fuel and Energy, and others, 
behaved irresponsibly. 
  [Gamedov] Did you share in the October offsetting of 
accounts? 
  [Akhundov] Yes, I gave it a higher rating because a 
relatively greater effect was achieved. 
  According to its results the sum of payments made on account 
reached a half trillion rubles in the republic as a whole. For 
this purpose the banks issued credit in the amount of R200 
billion, and R300 billion was paid out of money paid by debtors 
to their partners. 
  We shall conduct a similar offsetting of mutual claims in 
December. In this connection I am conveying through VYSHKA a 
request to the leaders of branches, enterprises, and 
organizations that during the remaining weeks they check all the 
debts against one another and provide for cashing in payment 
documents. 
  Incidentally, the banks of Azerbaijan have created extremely 
favorable conditions for the clients. The offsetting will be 
accompanied not only by payment for all documents that are in 
the card catalog but also payment for documents that will be due 
during the period when the offsetting is conducted. That is the 
first thing. 
  Second, in order to conduct it, credit will be granted with 
a 
sharp reduction of the interest rate, although this is to the 
detriment of the interests of the banks, since it will reduce 
their profit. The condition of the economy of Azerbaijan 
prompted us to adopt this tactic. We are doing this exclusively 
in the interests of the production collectives so that they will 
be able to cast off their heavy financial burden more quickly, 
rid themselves of debts, and put their working capital in order. 
Unfortunately, not all businessmen are understanding about our 
countersteps and are exerting no effort to improve the state of 
affairs. 
  I must say that such extremely favorable conditions for 
granting credit--only 5-10 percent--do not exist in any other 
CIS country. Businessmen must skillfully take advantage of this 
situation so as to end up this year with less financial strain. 
  [Gamedov] As I understand it a large number of labor 
collectives are constantly experiencing strain in finances. 
Because the existing constraints on funds make it impossible for 
them to organize production normally. 
  [Akhundov] That is because the unbridled and insane 
inflation 
has greatly devalued the working capital of the enterprises, 
organizations, and institutions and it is actually worth 
nothing. They turn this working capital and bank credit into 
debit indebtedness through the prepayment of accounts and they 
earn foreign currency, which then lies in the bank without 
moving. 
  It would be more correct to receive the debit indebtedness 
promptly, transfer it for prepayment when selling their products 
or rendering services, and put the foreign currency that is in 
the account into circulation either directly or by receiving 
rubles to cover it through the Baku Interbank Currency Exchange. 
  There are other shortcomings as well. A number of commodity 
producers do not sell their final products promptly, waiting for 
the next price hike. I will give some examples which provide a 
general idea of the great unutilized potential. Thus R257 
million worth of items have been stockpiled at the plant for 
household air conditioners, the Bytmash Plant is holding 
consumer goods worth 65 million, RORO [not further identified] 
Mebel--R530 million, Bakvinzavod No. 2--R78 million, the Baku 
textile combine imeni G.Z. Tagiyev--R91 million, and the Baku 
spinning-fabric association for children's items--R31 million. 
  [Gamedov] In order to formulate the next question I shall 
give two cases described in VYSHKA. In increasing the output of 
products everything depends on the transfer of money to the 
suppliers in order to acquire materials from them, but the 
banking system has been spinning its wheels for a long time now, 
according to the chairman of the STK [council of the labor 
collective] of the leasing sewing association imeni Ala 
Bayramov, F. Kafarov. "To transfer money through one bank into 
another even within Baku takes many days, which impedes its 
circulation," states the deputy general director of the 
Azstankoprom Production Association, M. Ismaylov. 
  There is no transfer of money to pay for raw and processed 
materials or batching items, or else this operation takes many 
months--the enterprises are doomed to stand idle. Therefore, the 
conclusion arises of its own accord: during the stage of 
transition to the market the banks are failing to perform one of 
their basic functions for prompt transfer of money on 
instructions from the clients. Is this not so? 
  [Akhundov] These are serious accusations, and we must look 
into them right now. Let us pose this question: Do the 
enterprises have anything to transfer, for example, to the CIS 
countries? If they do, there are no obstacles to that. In order 
to facilitate the transfer of funds, Prominvestbank is working 
actively to create direct ties with commercial banks of the CIS 
countries. Among the measures that have been taken is the 
opening of correspondent accounts in Moscow, Minsk, Almaty, 
Tbilisi, Donetsk, Odessa, Makhachkala, Naberezhnyye Chelny, etc. 
  Let us return to the fact that very frequently the 
enterprises do not have money to send to their partners in the 
CIS countries. Let us consider two aspects. The first is that 
they do not have this money because it is being accumulated in 
enterprises and organizations of nearby foreign countries. Thus 
the indebtedness on prepayment for goods and materials from our 
clients amounted to R9.7 billion and the debit indebtedness was 
R11 billion. Therefore they themselves are left without money. 
Either it must be returned or they must receive raw materials, 
processed materials, and batching items in order to load their 
own production more completely. 
  The second aspect is that our labor collectives must make it 
a point to earn currency of the country with which they have 
economic ties. Then there will be no difficulties with 
transferring money. 
  The problem can be approached from a different side. Let us 
say that our client has currency from Ukraine but does not have 
currency from Turkmenistan. Then the Baku Interbank Currency 
Exchange comes to its assistance. It is necessary to submit an 
application through the branch of our bank that serves him for 
the sale of karbovantsy and the purchase of Turkmen manats. All 
the other operations are conducted through the already existing 
structure and there is no need to submit an application for 
acquiring the currency of any other CIS country, even in cases 
when the enterprises have our manats. The same existing 
structure continues to operate. 
  Unfortunately, the Baku Interbank Currency Exchange cannot 
operate normally because of the lack of enterprises wanting to 
sell the necessary currency. And I already gave the reason for 
this above--tardy repayment of debit indebtedness. 
  The negative aspects must also be mentioned. There are still 
quite a few enterprises and organizations whose managers 
consciously and deliberately fail to return money for products 
that are delivered. At their request the money that is earned is 
transferred to commercial structures, not without selfish 
purposes, of course. 
  How do we avoid such large losses? The government is 
preparing a document for monitoring exports on the basis of a 
form for accounting for prepayment or presentation of letters of 
credit. I think that the introduction of the new rules will make 
it possible to regulate the receipt of funds in Azerbaijan for 
products that are delivered. 
  [Gamedov] And what about the transfer of money within the 
republic? 
  [Akhundov] The mechanism for this was developed long ago and 
very precisely, and it is functioning reliably. We introduced a 
special program for daily processing of payment documentation on 
the computer. Therefore there are no grounds for the complaints 
from certain enterprises, including the Azstankoprom Production 
Association. 
  If when running the program the computer deducts money from 
the account of one client, this necessarily must be reflected in 
the form of the deposit of this money into the account of 
another client. Otherwise the daily balance will not come out 
right, and this is the main method for performing banking 
activity. Let me emphasize especially that the money is 
transferred every day. 
  There may be a delay, not through the bank's fault but 
through the fault of the workers of the enterprises and 
organizations themselves, who sometimes make mistakes when 
filling out the payment documents. 
  Prominvestbank has 16 branches in Baku and two in Sumgait. 
All the information about the operation of these branches is 
received from them by the computers each day, and it is 
processed and sent back within 10-15 minutes. 
  Our branches in Gyandzh, Mingyachevir, and other places will 
be hooked up to this computer network in the near future. 
  [Gamedov] What is the purpose of transforming the former 
state bank into a joint-stock commercial bank? How many shares 
have been sold? 
  [Akhundov] The advantages of reorganizing it are apparent. 
Previously the bank received money from Moscow in order to 
exist. We are now earning it ourselves, we attract funds from 
our clients, and we offer credit with interest. 
  We have sold R200 million worth of shares to individuals. Of 
these shares, R150 million are unrestricted, so-called common 
stock and R50 million are preferred stock which is sold to 
workers of the founders. 
  For now I cannot say anything about the amounts of the 
dividends from them. At the end of the year we will sum up the 
results, call a stockholders meeting, consult, and decide. 
  Prominvestbank also has its depositors. Today there are R400 
million in the accounts under extremely favorable conditions: if 
a deposit is left for a year it increases by 80 percent, and 
more than a year--it doubles. If anybody wants to obtain more 
interest on his money we invite them to join our depositors.

<F P=106> [Interview with Rasul Kuliyev by Elmira Akhundova; place and </F>
date not given: "The New Speaker of the Azerbaijan Parliament 
Supports a Continuation of the Karabakh Peace Negotiations and, 
Simultaneously, the Formation of a Strong Professional Army"] 
  [Text] Despite his extraordinarily heavy work 
schedule, Rasul Kuliyev, newly elected chairman of the 
parliament of Azerbaijan, carved out several minutes for an 
interview with Radio Liberty correspondent Elmira Akhundova. The 
exclusive right to publish the interview was granted the 
ASSA-Irada Agency. 
  [Akhundova] Esteemed speaker, did it come as a surprise to 
you that Geydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, offered you the 
position of head of parliament and did you personally have any 
doubts as to whether you should accept this offer or not? 
  [Kuliyev] Of course, I could not make so responsible a 
decision on the spot. I had spoken with the president on this 
subject on more than one occasion and had weighed all the pros 
and cons. And I ultimately agreed because I am accustomed to 
independent work, I am accustomed to adopting responsible 
decisions, for which I myself have to answer first and foremost. 
I hope that in this office I will have more opportunities to 
influence a change in the course of events in the republic for 
the better. It was with this in mind that I agreed to let my 
name go forward. 
  [Akhundova] It is said that your confirmation was preceded 
by 
quite a tumultuous discussion and that not all members of the 
Milli Majlis accepted your candidacy without question. This is 
shown by the results of the voting also: 38 in favor, six 
against. Your opponents voiced misgivings as to whether you had 
sufficient diplomatic, political, and, finally, legal experience 
and knowledge to lead parliament--after all, you have hitherto 
been involved mainly in industry and economic activity. How 
would you respond to your opponents? 
  [Kuliyev] As though all our previous speakers had attended a 
school of diplomacy or had been professional politicians. As far 
as I am concerned, as director of the republic's biggest oil 
refinery and then vice premier in charge of the oil sector, I 
repeatedly took part in negotiations and in the elaboration of 
agreements with leading overseas companies. And would, what is 
more, frequently get into legal niceties which some members of 
parliament have not even dreamed of. In addition, I have been a 
member of parliament for about three years and have in this 
capacity on a par with everyone taken part in the preparation 
and adoption of several dozen laws regulating at the present 
time the most varied spheres of our society's political and 
economic life. As far as the lack of theoretical knowledge is 
concerned, first, this assertion does not correspond to reality 
either and, second, many at first sight fine and necessary laws 
have been adopted in parliament here in recent years which, 
however, have not worked, virtually, remaining to a large extent 
on paper only. And all because the people at the helm of 
administration of the state have not known how to make them 
work, how to put them into practice. It seems to me, therefore, 
that the experience of business leader, hands-on knowledge in 
the sphere of enterprise, and a precise vision of how the 
economy should be reformed and in which direction will help me 
make the right decisions. 
  [Akhundova] The opposition's main demand is for early 
parliamentary elections, for the present parliament, in the 
opinion of the opposition parties and movements, is conclusively 
discredited. Your opinion on this score? How do you view this 
parliament, with which you will have to work? 
  [Kuliyev] You know, I do not believe that this parliament is 
as bad as the opposition says. This demand--for early 
parliamentary elections--incidentally, was made before also, at 
the time of rule of the Elchibey regime. However, both Isa 
Gambar, former chairman of parliament, and other leaders were in 
no hurry to dissolve parliament, preferring to work with the 
"illegitimate," as they put it, Milli Majlis, for whose creation 
they had expended so much effort. I personally believe that our 
parliament has matured considerably on the professional level. 
It has performed a great deal of law-making work, and it is not, 
I repeat, its fault that the laws it has adopted have not 
worked. As was the president and his style of work, so also was 
parliament. I am sure that we can and should work with the 
present parliament through the end of its term. Not violating 
the constitution and not resorting to forcible measures. 
  [Akhundova] What will be for you the priority in the office 
of speaker of parliament? 
  [Kuliyev] The main thing in the economy today is to open the 
way to truly market relations and to give honest enterprise 
freedom in order to chop off at the root the causes of 
bribe-taking and corruption demoralizing our society. And the 
main thing in social and political life is to put an end as 
quickly as possible to the enervating, bloody war. I will work 
in this direction. All members of parliament also should step up 
their activity in this direction. 
  [Akhundova] And what do you prefer--a continuation of the 
negotiating process with the Armenian side or tougher, power 
measures? 
  [Kuliyev] Political dialogue and peace negotiations under 
the 
aegis of the international organizations should, of course, 
continue. At the same time I am for the creation of a strong 
professional army, which could serve as a dependable guarantor 
of the state independence and territorial integrity of our 
republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Namik Akhundov, head of the Supreme Soviet </F>
of Azerbaijan Department of International Relations, by 
unidentified ASSA-Irad correspondent; place and date not given: 
"Cooperation Between the Parliaments of Azerbaijan and Britain"] 
  [Text] 
  [Correspondent] Britain has recently been displaying 
increased interest in the events in the Transcaucasus and, 
particularly, in the development of the Armenia-Azerbaijan 
conflict. The visits of British statesmen to our republic have 
become more frequent. How do you evaluate Britain's position in 
the solution of questions of vital importance to Azerbaijan? 
  [Akhundov] I would note Britain's objectivity both in 
respect 
to the events in our region and during discussion of all the 
first three resolutions in the UN Security Council. The draft of 
the latest, fourth, resolution, which Britain is at this moment 
correcting, was submitted for Security Council discussion 
recently. It differs from Resolution No. 874, with whose content 
Azerbaijan has in principle remained dissatisfied and which it 
has regarded as a retreat from the provisions of the preceding 
Resolutions 822 and 853. 
  [Correspondent] You mean that Britain is preparing a draft 
new resolution? 
  [Akhundov] Britain is a member of the UN Security Council. 
Usually each country on the Security Council makes its 
corrections and submits its observations and revisions during 
the elaboration of official documents. At the present time the 
draft new resolution is being studied at the British Foreign 
Ministry. 
  [Correspondent] May it be maintained that all these visits, 
meetings, and talks will somehow influence the opinion of the 
world community, help Azerbaijan find new supporters, and 
produce specific results? 
  [Akhundov] The first British parliamentary delegation came 
to 
Azerbaijan this April. It consisted of representatives of the 
Conservative and Labor parties. It was followed on a visit to 
our republic by Dr. Clark, representative of the Labor Party and 
shadow defense secretary. And, finally, this month--the latest 
visit of representatives of the British parliament. The result 
of all these contacts was the joint decision to form a special 
group in the British parliament for liaison with the parliament 
of Azerbaijan and our republic as a whole. This group will 
register with the Interparliamentary Union, which may be seen as 
a positive factor in Azerbaijan's favor. 
  [Correspondent] How are relations with the parliaments of 
other countries shaping up? 
  [Akhundov] There are no further such examples of cooperation 
as yet, unfortunately. Relations have been established with 
neighboring Turkey, but they have not been seen through to the 
end. It is very important today that at this difficult, dramatic 
time for Azerbaijan foreign countries and the public obtain 
objective information and learn the truth. I believe it to be of 
considerable importance that Britain itself and the British 
parliament are commenting objectively on the events taking place 
here. Interparliamentary contacts--a guarantee of the 
development of further cooperation between our states--are 
taking shape. I have to mention Mr. James Spicer--a sponsor of 
the creation of the interparliamentary group. He is the head in 
Britain of the Westminster Democracy Foundation, which, 
obviously, will perform an important role in relations between 
our states. We outlined in the negotiations the first specific 
steps, and Mr. Spicer proposed the formation of a group of 10-15 
young politicians which would in the future visit Britain. It is 
contemplated that the Azerbaijani politicians will meet with 
politicians of Britain, visit the British parliament, and 
acquire visual lessons in parliamentarianism and democracy. In 
addition, we believe that the foundation will associate itself 
actively with the implementation of cultural activities. 
  [Correspondent] In other words, the foundations of further 
mutual relations between Azerbaijan and Britain, between the 
parliaments of the two countries, are being laid today, now? 
  [Akhundov] Yes, and this is in itself a very good beginning. 
It implants hope of the possibility of cooperation and the 
establishment of stable relations with the parliaments of other 
states of Europe and Asia and neighboring Iran and Turkey. I 
believe that Azerbaijan could find political partners in the Far 
East also. 
  [Correspondent] I would like to hope that this cooperation 
will not be of an episodic nature but will become a system and a 
direction of the parliament of Azerbaijan's overseas activity. 
  [Akhundov] We will aspire to constant interaction with all 
parliaments of the world. Relations based on cooperation, mutual 
trust, and friendship have stood the test of time and given a 
good account of themselves and serve only the interests of peace 
and stability. 
  [Correspondent] Than you for the interview.

<F P=106> [Interview with former President of Georgia Zviad </F>
Gamsakhurdia's widow Manana and other family members, by 
LITERATURNAYA GAZETA special correspondent Oleg Moroz; place and 
date not given: "Manana Gamsakhurdia: `Let Me Give My Husband a 
Decent Burial!'"] 
  [Text] Groznyy-Moscow--I succeeded in getting to talk 
to Manana Archvadze-Gamsakhurdia, the widow of the former 
president of Georgia, only on the third try. I had come to their 
home--the former residence of the Chechen-Ingush Obkom [oblast 
party committee], where General Dudayev's portrait is now 
displayed prominently--twice, but she was unable to talk, 
although she did try... The third time, apparently moved by the 
feeling that we have to talk somehow--after all, a person has 
traveled all the way from Moscow--she rose from a sofa where she 
lay lying covered with a plaid blanket and moved to a nearby 
chair. 
  I expected the conversation to go one of two ways: once 
engaged in conversation about her husband she may again feel 
unwell and I would have to leave again, perhaps for good; or, on 
the contrary, reminiscences would perk her up somewhat, distract 
her from the continuous self-immolation that had been going on 
for many days now. Fortunately, it was the latter--as we talked, 
her face regained some color; being a direct and emotional 
person, she immersed herself entirely in the world she was 
talking about. 
  [Moroz] Manana, when was the last time you saw Zviad 
Konstantinovich? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] On 24 September. That was the day he left 
here. That was our last meeting. 
  [Moroz] Did you talk on the phone? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] We talked on the phone every day. 
  [Moroz] When was your last conversation? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] When they entered Zugdidi. After that all 
communications between us were cut. 
  [Moroz] Who are "they"? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] The Tbilisi junta and the Russian paratroops. 
  [Moroz] What did you talk about? The events in Western 
Georgia? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] No, we did not talk about the events because 
the conversations were listened to. He was simply reassuring me: 
"Do not worry, Manana, everything will be fine." He still had 
hopes that the Russian troops would be withdrawn from Western 
Georgia. I kept telling him: "Zviad, you are probably lying to 
me. You say everything is going well, but the television says 
entirely different things."--"No, Manana, this is not so. I am 
right in the thick of events. The people have rebelled. Everyone 
is for the president. So do not worry. These Russians will not 
be able to hold on here for long." It turned out differently, 
though. The Russians together with Mkhedrioni cleared out the 
whole of Mingrelia.[end Gamsakhurdia] 
  I had heard this contention--that the Russian troops, 
"Baltin's landing," had been instrumental in the defeat of 
Gamsakhurdia's supporters--before I met with Manana Gamsakhurdia 
for this interview, from her household. I tried to say something 
timidly: The Russian soldiers only provided protection of 
railroads and communications, I said--but was mercilessly 
ridiculed as a victim of Moscow's propaganda. For this reason, 
this time I chose not to argue with Manana. 
  [Moroz] When did you learn of your husband's death? From 
whom? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] On 4 January. From a person close to us... 
  [Moroz] How true is this information? Rumors are still 
circulating that Gamsakhurdia is alive... 
  [Gamsakhurdia] You see, I would love to believe this more 
than anybody else. I am the closest person to him, and I am 
taking it hard... I do not even know how I will survive this 
all. But I had to believe it because my acquaintance told me 
everything, beginning to end. 
  [Moroz] You have not seen, of course, the last note your 
husband left behind? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] What note? There was no note. This is all 
conjecture. 
  [Moroz] How did the children take the news of their father's 
death? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] Oh, do not remind me of this! This is the 
second tragedy in my family. The younger one tells me: "Mama, 
when I get up in the morning I feel as if this is all a 
dream..." And the older one... I do not know how he will get 
through all this. He stays up all night and cries endlessly. And 
talks to him as if he were alive.[end Gamsakhurdia] 
  Gamsakhurdia's sons--17-year-old and very tall Tsotne, and 
15-year-old Georgiy, who looks very much like his father--of 
course do not approve of their mother's revelations in a 
conversation with a journalist. Their pain and suffering is 
their own personal business, something they do not display to 
outsiders. But, of course, it would not occur to them to say 
even one word of reproach to their mother. 
  [Moroz] Does the younger one take it easier? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] The younger one does not let me see his 
tears. 
So that I will not get upset and start crying, too. I found out 
that he goes out into the yard, sits behind the house, and cries 
there. The older one cannot help it. He is crying right now. And 
will keep crying all night--until 0800, 0900. He is crying and 
talking to him: "Zviad, I cannot accept it! Why are you lying 
there? Why do I still live?"[end Gamsakhurdia] 
  Yes, this is inconsolable human grief, an inconsolable human 
tragedy. And the devil has prompted me once again, how many 
times is it now, to barge in on human grief, human tragedy, with 
idle journalistic curiosity. But such are the rules of the game, 
such are the rules of the profession. There are moments when the 
journalistic profession prompts one to immoral acts. It is a 
vicious circle: being a professional, one does immoral things. I 
should have thought about this earlier, when I decided to choose 
a journalistic career. 
  "He says such words," Manana continues, referring to the 
older son. "He prays endlessly, from morning to night. They took 
the Bible and read it together. They beg our Lord to return 
their father to them alive--for our father to rise from ashes, 
they say, like Lazarus. This is a great tragedy." 
  [Moroz] Zviad Konstantinovich was a busy man. Did he still 
find time to spend with his sons? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] Time is not important in communication. He 
was 
like a friend, an older comrade to them. He found time for 
them... Sometimes he would come and kiss them late at night, 
when they were already asleep. And when he was leaving--oh, my, 
how they parted! How they hugged and kissed each other! 
  [Moroz] Did they not want to go with him? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] Oh, yes, of course... This is precisely the 
point. The older one cries all night: "Why did Zviad not take me 
there? I would die next to him! What do I need this life for 
without a father, without such a man! Zviad was a holy man for 
me."[end Gamsakhurdia] 
  I talked to both boys. In conversation with a stranger, 
Tsotne did not display even a hint of any weakness. He answered 
the questions in a measured, somewhat dry manner. Among other 
things he said that at this point he does not plan to engage in 
political activities. On the other hand, again, this does not 
tell of his true intentions--only that he does not intend to 
reveal them to every stranger. He is a first-year student at the 
University of Chechnya. The Department of Philology, Roman and 
German languages--his father's specialty. It was his father who 
helped him prepare for the entrance exams last summer. The 
younger one, Georgiy, on the contrary, does not hide his career 
plans: "They are wrong to think that my father's death brought 
everything to an end!"--"Do you understand," I tell him, "what a 
dangerous road you want to take?"--"Yes, I do. I am not afraid 
to die."--"Do you not have any pity for your mother? Did she not 
have enough when your father died?" He is silent, staring in the 
air. On the outside, a regular teenager in a denim jacket and 
sports woolen cap pulled down over his forehead, edges rolled up 
like a loop. It is always shocking when a child, prematurely 
grown up, says words that few adults would utter. 
  [Moroz] Manana, are you not concerned that the boys will 
also 
get involved in the political struggle now and will be in danger? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] They already are in danger now. Shevardnadze 
is a kind of a man who will stop at nothing.[end Gamsakhurdia] 
  Still, let us hope for the best. There are still several 
years to go. Lately, the world around us has been undergoing a 
complete makeover, beyond recognition, in a matter of two to 
three years. Who would think that one of the most famous Soviet 
dissidents, many times arrested, persecuted, and later elected 
president of Georgia by an absolute majority of the vote (87 
percent), would end his life by putting a gun to his head in a 
God-forsaken mountain village, hounded and surrounded from all 
sides, and his family, alone and disconsolate, would be mourning 
the irretrievable loss of a loved one in a strange land? Perhaps 
in a few years everything will turn around in just as unexpected 
and strange way and the sons will not have to repeat the 
crusades of their fathers? 
  [Moroz] Manana, how did you meet? To the best of my 
knowledge, you are 10 years younger than your husband. 
  [Gamsakhurdia] Yes. What brought us together was the 
illnesses of our mothers. My mother developed cancer, and I was 
looking for a Swiss medication that at the time was not sold in 
the Soviet Union. It so happened that Zviad's mother, Miranda 
Gamsakhurdia, also had cancer at the time, and I learned 
accidentally that they had this medication. I asked whether they 
would share it with me. So one day Zviad comes and drops off a 
pile like this of packets of the medication. And a whole folder 
of materials on how to use it. This is how we met. 
  [Moroz] Did you have a traditional Georgian family or was it 
different from other families? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] It was a traditional Georgian family. It was 
also traditional in the sense that it had long traditions. 
Because his mother was a princess, and his father was a prince 
as well. As you know, he was a Georgian national writer. 
  [Moroz] Which period of life was the happiest for you? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] Which?.. Upon the passage of these 20 
years--in October of this year we were to celebrate our 20-year 
wedding anniversary--it turns out that all periods were happy 
for me. Despite the fact that we were constantly persecuted and 
arrested twice. I mean, he was arrested twice. During our life 
together. Altogether he had been arrested four times. We went to 
internal exile together--Kizlyar Rayon in Dagestan... 
  [Moroz] Was this a happy period, too? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] Let me tell you this. It was very difficult 
there. Very. We spent 18 months there. Cold and hungry, the KGB 
constantly over our heads. He was not permitted to travel more 
than 10 kilometers from the designated point of exile. Every 
Saturday or Sunday we were visited by people from Neftekumsk who 
came to ascertain that he was still there. The conditions were 
terrible. In the winter, minus 40 degrees. Monsoon winds. And 
intolerable heat in the summer. All sort of insects, 
tarantulas... We were very poor. Despite all of this, however, I 
was the happiest woman in the world. Because we were together. 
Prior to that we had not seen each other for such a long time, 
and now we were there. This was 2 August 1979. 
  [Moroz] That you had a lot of hardship in exile is to be 
expected. What about other times--you probably lived quite well? 
I mean, in a material sense. 
  [Gamsakhurdia] I have never been interested in the things 
many women are interested in these days--dressing well, shining 
at receptions, travelling abroad... I did not travel abroad; I 
dressed as our budget permitted. I did not consider this a 
misfortune. Or fortune, for that matter. I repeat, I was the 
happiest woman in the world because I was next to such a man... 
  [Moroz] Why did you not take the name of Gamsakhurdia? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] My surname is Archvadze-Gamsakhurdia. You 
see, 
in our family there were three sisters--my parents did not have 
any sons. When I was still in 10th grade I promised my father I 
would keep his name as long as I lived. 
  [Moroz] Did you discuss political issues with your husband? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] No, we did not, but our life was such that 
whether we wanted it or not, everything revolved around 
politics. When a man is persecuted, when they show up at your 
house with a search warrant, when you are arrested, exiled, sent 
to Lefortovo prison, to a psychiatric ward--what else can you 
talk about? 
  [Moroz] Did your parents try to talk you out of marrying 
Gamsakhurdia? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] My parents had passed away by then. But my 
mother knew Zviad before we got married--they became acquainted 
after the incident with the medication. She loved Zviad very 
much, so naturally she would not have tried to talk me out of 
it. As for myself, I knew very well what I was doing. Even 
before we got married, whenever he visited me he brought various 
anti-Soviet literature published in Moscow. Such as the 
CHRONICLES OF CURRENT EVENTS. We reprinted and distributed it. I 
think that Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn and Alik Ginzburg 
will never forget that Gamsakhurdia was the first person to 
distribute the "GULAG Archipelago" in the Soviet Union. When he 
was arrested in 1977, the first charge against him was 
distributing the "Archipelago." Then later there was publication 
of the GOLDEN FLEECE and VESTNIK GRUZII [GEORGIAN HERALD]. I, 
too, participated in their distribution.[end Gamsakhurdia] 
  A year and a half ago in this house, in an adjacent room, in 
the office of the head of the house, I spent two hours talking 
to Zviad Gamsakhurdia himself. Both then and now I kept, and 
keep, thinking that perhaps it would have been better if that 
difficult but romantic period of dissident life had lasted as 
long as possible? Actually, better for whom? After all, the 
world surrounding us has indeed changed for the better. Or at 
least it is on the way to such a change. Thanks to dissidents 
among others. But dissidents themselves suddenly started feeling 
uncomfortable in it. The simplicity of existence is gone: Here 
is an anti-people's, inhuman authority we have to fight against 
with all we have got. Should it be surprising that few of the 
former rebels have been able to adapt to these changes? 
  [Moroz] You said that all the periods of your life with 
Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia were happy. Does the period when he became first 
Supreme Soviet chairman and then president not stand apart in 
some way? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] It does, and probably for the worse. I was 
very upset when I learned that he had become chairman of the 
Georgian Supreme Soviet. At the time of his election I was in 
the audience. Maybe I had a premonition of what tragedy was in 
store for us in the future--I began crying. A journalist came 
over to me and asked why I was crying when everyone around me 
was jubilant. I said that beginning that day our family was 
ruined. Because Zviad took upon himself such a heavy cross to 
bear. Had we lived in a normal state, had Georgia not been 
occupied by a foreign army, had Georgia been a democratic 
independent country, it would have been different. True, when he 
became president I was happy because Zviad himself was happy. 
Because the absolute majority of the Georgian population 
supported him. I believed that now nobody could treat him like 
they treated, for instance, the disobedients in Vilnius. It 
turned out, though, that they had completely different 
intentions. What was in store for us was worse. This is what I 
could not anticipate. 
  [Moroz] Still, you had bad premonitions... Did you not try 
to 
talk him out of this fight? I mean this time--this last period 
of his life. 
  [Gamsakhurdia] In no way. Never. Because he had chosen this 
road since childhood, since he was 15. He was first arrested 
when he was 16. I had no moral right to be talking him out of 
it. How could I face him with an ultimatum: "You must stop 
fighting!"? This means he would have to leave Georgia. I was not 
capable of saying such a thing to him because I also love my 
motherland. I also wanted Georgia to be free, to separate from 
the other republics. And in the end Zviad's dream did come true. 
Why should I stand in his way? He took the road of Christ and 
the road of freedom. The road of purity and the road of love. 
  [Moroz] How was your life in Groznyy? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] Very difficult. Despite all the attention we 
were given here. The people came to love Zviad very much. 
  [Moroz] Did you meet with President Dudayev often? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] Very often. They were like brothers with 
Gamsakhurdia despite different faiths. He is also so upset now! 
And his wife visits us almost every day. They do everything 
possible to prevent us feeling alone here. 
  [Moroz] Did you try to talk your husband out of going to 
Georgia last September? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] No. This was the only time he ever deceived 
me. Although I would rather not see this word in a newspaper. He 
wanted to shield us somehow from this situation, not wanting to 
jeopardize the life of his sons. He told me: "Manana, I will go 
alone for now, and after some time--very soon--you will come 
with the children." I was waiting for that day. Can you imagine? 
I was waiting: Maybe he will send someone today, tomorrow... We 
talked on the phone, and I kept reminding him: "Zviad, what 
about it? Will you keep your word or not?"--"I will, Manana. It 
will be very soon." This is how he stalled for time. He knew 
everything beforehand and did not want to jeopardize his family. 
  [Moroz] Do you have any property left in Georgia? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] We had a house there. It was the house of 
Gamsakhurdia's father; we lived there. On 6 January 1992 
Ioseliani, Kitovani, and their confederates plundered it, and 
then two months later burned it down. So there are only charred 
walls left now... And in the summer they even defiled the grave 
of Zviad's mother and father. 
  [Moroz] How are you going to live from now on? Or do you not 
think about it right now? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] I keep thinking about it. How am I to live 
now? I have no money. Absolutely. I have no home. My children 
are deprived of their motherland. They have nothing. All the 
clothes we have on, the Chechens bought for us. We came here 
with nothing. I was wearing a housecoat...[end Gamsakhurdia] 
  When I was preparing for my trip to Groznyy, I was asked to 
take with me some money collected by Georgian businessmen living 
in Moscow for the Gamsakhurdia family. Many people made pledges. 
When I left, however, all I had in my pocket was my per diem 
allowance. Businessmen's love is as short-lived as popular love 
(this again refers to the 87 percent of vote cast for 
Gamsakhurdia at the presidential elections). 
  [Moroz] Are you planning to return to Georgia? 
  [Gamsakhurdia] As long as the junta is there--no. As long as 
Shevardnadze is there, I will not return.[end Gamsakhurdia] 
  Fifteen-year-old Georgiy mentioned in his conversation with 
me: "Father is buried in a village... I cannot tell you which 
village it is."--"Is it not the village reported in the press?" 
I inquired, puzzled. "No, a different one." 
  For several weeks now a tug of war has been going on between 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia's family and the authorities. The authorities 
insist on conducting a full-scale formal investigation of the 
circumstances of the former president's death, with the forensic 
expert evaluation required in such cases, autopsy, etc. 
Gamsakhurdia's widow is categorically against it. She consents 
only to visual identification of the body, after which it is to 
be sent to Groznyy. The authorities' logic: A man died under 
mysterious circumstances; the law requires that the cause of his 
death be ascertained. But there is also another logic: Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia died on territory where military operations were in 
progress; in essence he died like a soldier, and is there such a 
law that requires surrendering the body of a slain soldier to 
his enemies? There is no such law. There is, however, a rule 
dictated by the norms of humanism--to hand over to relatives the 
body of a dead person so that they may dispose of it at their 
discretion. This humanistic norm is what Manana Gamsakhurdia is 
appealing to. So far, in vain. The Georgia authorities for some 
reason staunchly refuse to meet the request of a woman 
devastated by grief; the report that official delegations 
shuttle from Tbilisi to Groznyy for negotiations while she is 
being difficult turn out upon closer look to be ordinary 
disinformation (I was a witness to this myself: On Friday 
"Ostankino" reported that a delegation from Tbilisi, consisting 
of representatives of the authorities and the procuracy, was on 
its way to Groznyy; what arrived, however, was a group of 
Tbilisi intellectuals, to express condolences to Gamsakhurdia's 
widow--that is all, I myself was present at that meeting). 
  On 16 January, Manana Gamsakhurdia sent a telegram to 
Russian 
president Boris Yeltsin, to both chambers of the Russian 
parliament, the heads of other CIS states, as well as to the 
United Nations and the CSCE. She asks them to interfere, to 
influence the Tbilisi authorities, to help her to finally get 
the body of her husband so she can say a last "goodbye" to him 
and bury him in a Christian manner. Can it happen that this 
plea, too, will have no effect?

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister of the Russian Government V. </F>
Chernomyrdin by I. Yakovleva; place and date not given: "V. 
Chernomyrdin: `One of the Special Features of 1994 Will Be the 
Government's Realistic Approach to Promises. We Cannot Do 
Everything Now, But the Decisions We Make Must Be Backed Up By 
Finances': The Prime Minister of the Russian Government Answers 
Our Readers' Questions"] 
  [Text] 
  [Yakovleva] Viktor Stepanovich, a question that concerns all 
economic subjects: Will the reshuffling in the government cause 
a substantial correction of the course of reforms? 
  [Chernomyrdin] The Program of Reforms adopted on 6 August 
1993 and then approved by the president did not undergo any 
corrections when Ye. Gaydar joined the government in September 
last year. Neither are there now, nor will there be, any drastic 
corrections to the government's course of reforms. 
  There will be a certain correction with respect to methods, 
which is dictated not by personnel reshuffling but by life 
itself. 
  [Yakovleva] Speaking of methods of pulling the economy out 
of 
the crisis--combating inflation and preventing a catastrophic 
production decline are two ends of the same stick. Is one 
direction favored over the other? 
  [Chernomyrdin] The government has never been divided into 
two 
groups--supporters of reining in the growth in the money supply 
and those in favor of preventing a deep decline by pumping money 
into the economy, with the resulting inflation. There has always 
been agreement that we need an optimum way of avoiding both 
hyperinflation and hyperdecline. The choice of some or other 
measures depended on a specific economic situation. 
  I believe that the main task currently has been 
accomplished: 
we have constrained demand-generated inflation, when, 
figuratively speaking, money is chasing goods. Now it is 
important to halt inflation driven by costs, which is associated 
with the lack of real competition in the production of most 
varieties of goods. This is a slightly different task, which 
transcends the boundaries of purely macroeconomic regulation of 
the economy and demands different approaches capable of bringing 
about an improvement in the situation. For instance, it may be 
useful to introduce the practice of entering into agreements 
between the government, trade unions, and entrepreneurs with 
respect to setting output prices and fixing wages at a certain 
level for some period of time. At the same time we do not reject 
the strict financial policy of the past; control over the growth 
of money supply will not be loosened under any circumstances. 
  [Yakovleva] On occasions you have said that the rate of 
inflation is in inverse correlation to the pace of reforms. What 
is your appraisal of the results of last year, keeping in mind 
that many people have not been paid and enterprises have not 
replenished their working capital for months? 
  [Chernomyrdin] Financial stabilization efforts stumble 
against, on one hand, the structural crisis in the economy, 
which provokes investment stagnation and production decline. On 
the other hand, it runs into the actions of federal bodies of 
authority, which were compelled to make promises they cannot 
keep. I do not deny that the decline in the rate of inflation in 
the fourth quarter of last year, when it was brought down to 
12-15 percent a month, was achieved through an increase in the 
government's budget liability. This is very difficult to explain 
to those who were affected by it, but I am convinced that we did 
the right thing. In our economy there is no other way of doing 
this. 
  In the first quarter of 1994 budget expenditures are to 
remain on the level of the fourth quarter of last year. In 
addition, we will have to pay the most "burning" debts--to 
defense enterprises, the Far North, the agro-industrial complex, 
and the back pay to budget-financed enterprises. Back in 
November I foresaw that the rate of inflation in January would 
be 20-22 percent. True, the first quarter is always difficult; 
we started out the same way in 1993. On average, for the first 
half of the year inflation is expected to be in the range of 
15-18 percent a month, and in the second half--11-12 percent; by 
the end of the year we hope to bring it down to 7-9 percent. 
Inflation in our country currently follows the 
inertial-oscillatory pattern. 
  [Yakovleva] Do you see a way out of this vicious circle 
where 
the rate of inflation is predicated on the government not 
fulfilling its obligations? 
  [Chernomyrdin] I do. First and foremost, the government 
should not make unrealistic promises. We need to conduct our 
work in such a way that we can carry out what we plan and 
promise. We should not develop a program and place orders for 
products unless we have the money to pay for them. This is one 
of the special features of this year--a realistic policy in this 
area. We will not be able to jump into everything--it is not 
possible, but once we make a decision, we have to provide 
financing. 
  [Yakovleva] Can we count on preferential credits this year? 
  [Chernomyrdin] I am a rather tightfisted man; I do not like 
to give away and hand out. The government will not engage in 
issuance of preferential credits right and left. With respect to 
investment, we have a program of selective support of 
production, and we intend to carry it out. As to unprofitable 
enterprises, there is a law on bankruptcy and the mechanism for 
its implementation. Unprofitable enterprises must be 
restructured or, if this is impossible, closed. Our efforts in 
the area of financial and credit policy must be reinforced by 
placing the emphasis on structural and investment policy, 
creating incentives for Russian producers. This will allow us to 
remove the causes that force the government to make promises 
that are hard to carry out. 
  [Yakovleva] How can we ensure effective use of state money, 
to make sure that financial infusions will not be used for 
consumption? 
  [Chernomyrdin] We now demand that a mechanism be put 
together 
for using credit, which will go first and foremost to the 
military-industrial and agrarian complexes. Such a mechanism is 
now being set up by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank 
together with these sectors. Enterprises have a lot of problems 
now--wages, working capital. But the important part is to ensure 
that this money goes into targeted programs. For the 
military-industrial complex this means covering unpaid-for 
defense orders; for agricultural enterprises--preparations for 
spring sowing, buying fertilizer, fuels, and spare parts, and 
repairing equipment. Unless such programs are submitted, 
enterprises will not get the money.

<H5>  Once Again, The Results of "Shock Therapy" </H5>
  After 2 years (1992 and 1993), sufficient time has elapsed 
to 
review the "shock therapy" and assess its results. 
  In giving a positive assessment of the movement that was 
begun toward a market economy, we nevertheless must note the 
continuously increasing "price," excessive in many respects, 
which society has already paid and which it will be forced to 
pay for the strategy and tactics chosen for the transition to 
the market. 
  The scale of the current crisis, which has increased as 
the result of the "shock therapy" and its internal structure, is 
having an extremely harmful effect on the solution of social 
problems and is fraught with the irreversible destruction of the 
country's economic and scientific-technical potential. 
  In just the past 2 years, the production recession reached 
about 30 percent in the most important macroeconomic indicators, 
and compared with the level before the crisis, it came close to 
40 percent. At the same time, it is important to stress that the 
production recession is not structural but universal in nature, 
first of all, and secondly, the most advanced and 
high-technology sectors and forms of production have been 
affected to the greatest extent. 
  The "shock therapy" ideologists assess the consequences of 
the production recession very superficially; they consider it a 
matter that is temporary and easily redressed. To make it more 
convincing, they refer to historical experience, when the 
country regained its former strength in a relatively short 
period of time after tremendous destruction and losses (as the 
result of the Civil War and World War II). 
  The following must be mentioned in this regard: 
  First. Under current conditions, the loss of 
production volume is the loss of the market, and not just the 
world market (for example, in the aerospace industry, in arms 
production, and so forth), but the domestic market as well. Once 
a place in the market is given up, it is extremely difficult to 
regain it. 
  Second. Historical analogies are not persuasive in 
this case. The time when an economy could be restored with the 
help of a shovel and a hoe, by relying on mass enthusiasm or 
coercion of the population, has gone forever. This may be 
accomplished in the modern world only with the support of the 
latest equipment, technology, and production organization. 
Having lost this capability, the country is unavoidably doomed 
to lag behind for a protracted period, and perhaps permanently. 
  The socioeconomic consequences of the recession in 
investment activity are the most far-reaching and 
dangerous. In just the past 2 years, the volume of 
investments in the Russian economy declined by more than 
one-half, and today it is about 40 percent of the level before 
the crisis. 
  With a volume such as this, not only structural 
reorganization is impossible, but elementary production growth 
as well. But the problem is deeper and more complex. Even today 
the depreciation of fixed production capital has come close to 
60 percent, that is, to the threshold beyond which physical 
destruction of the country's production potential begins. The 
public has become a witness to the increasing danger of 
accidents and disasters. 
  The crisis which is under way has also affected the field of 
science (including basic and sectorial science, planning and 
design work, and experimental and prototype production). The 
first-rate and world-class collectives are being disintegrated 
before our eyes, the leadership in a number of fields of 
scientific and technical progress is being lost, and the 
physical base is becoming hopelessly obsolete. 
  The country is losing its intellectual potential, along with 
hopes for Russia's revival and prosperity. 
  The collapse of the financial system and the loss of 
control over the circulation of money--this is one of the 
consequences of the "shock therapy" policy and the methods of 
implementing it. We have not managed to normalize the 
budgetary system in 2 years, in spite of huge loans from the 
Central Bank to cover the deficit and the artificial withdrawals 
from the Pension Fund. The payments crisis resulting from 
actions that were insufficiently considered and the inability to 
provide for the normal receipt of taxes have only undermined the 
income base of the budget and made for a chronic deficit. 
  The government has made extensive use of the emission to 
fulfill its populist declarations and as a distinctive narcotic 
to "reassure" production. Over the past 2 years it has been the 
principal borrower of Central Bank funds. The cash emission 
increased from 1.5 trillion rubles [R] in 1992 to R10.1 trillion 
in 1993, and its proportion in the total money supply grew from 
24 to 37 percent. And practically all of the cash put into 
circulation over the past year has remained in the public's 
hands or is providing for the nonbanking turnover of resources. 
  The increase in inflation induced by the liberalization of 
prices has not ceased over the 2 years. The average monthly 
inflation rate in 1993 was even higher than in the preceding 
year (if the January "surge" in 1992 is excluded). The lack of 
success in the struggle against inflation can be attributed to 
misunderstanding of its nature in the Russian economy 
(underestimation of its highly monopolized structure, disregard 
for the cost inflation factor, and so forth), and accordingly by 
the choice of inadequate and purely monetary means to hold it in 
check by demand limitations. 
  The progress and results of privatization are far from 
ambiguous. The breakdown of total state control of the economy 
and the emergence of a growing number of quite energetic real 
property owners should be included among its pluses, first of 
all. The negative consequences, in many respects, stem from 
insufficient consideration of privatization itself and the haste 
to implement it. Administrative pressure and the monotony of 
forms of privatization were maintained (orientation exclusively 
toward the establishment of open joint-stock companies), and a 
reliable legal basis was not established. The ideologists of 
privatization proclaimed that the issuance of vouchers did not 
provide for its national nature, and that the real depreciation 
of the vouchers' value and their concentration in a small number 
of investment funds was fraught not only with further 
stratification of society, but an increase in social tension. 
  The concept of state refusal to regulate economic and 
social processes has turned into a general loss of 
controllability. World experience in state regulation, 
especially in countries with a socially oriented market economy, 
has been disregarded. The special role of the state inherent in 
transitional stages of social development has not been taken 
into account. 
  The results of carrying out a monetarist policy and the 
state's withdrawal from regulation of economic and social 
processes as an integral part of it have demonstrated the 
theoretical and practical unsoundness of the course chosen. 
  The exhaustion of social resources to continue the 
"shock therapy" is an alarming result of implementing this 
policy for 2 years. The decrease in public incomes by more 
than one-half and the sharp increase in their differentiation 
have exacerbated the social situation in the country. At 
present, the incomes of the 10 percent of the citizens who are 
most well-off are 10 times higher than the incomes of those who 
are the least well-off; one-third of the public have incomes 
below the official subsistence minimum, and 10 percent of the 
population, or about 15 million persons, are beyond the 
threshold of physical survival. This is a warning that the 
society is entering a zone of social conflicts. 
  It must be stressed that this is not simply a matter of 
quantitative indicators. Over the past 2 years there have been 
far-reaching qualitative changes and trends have developed which 
attest to the emergence of a threat to Russian society itself. A 
process of depopulation has begun, and the rising mortality rate 
is attributable to a large extent to alcoholism, murders, and 
suicides. There is a sharp increase of persons in a marginal 
status, and the number of poor, homeless, alcoholics, and drug 
addicts is rising. The quality of "human material" is declining 
at a very high rate (immunity to mass diseases is declining, and 
prostitution, venereal diseases, and births of children with 
deficiencies are on the increase). 
  The public's moral principles, social values and ideals, and 
personal and family hopes, which always have made it possible to 
survive temporary adversities are collapsing, it would appear. 
Crime is on the increase and becoming brazen and mafia groups 
are multiplying. The bribery, extortion, and embezzlement which 
are becoming widespread are not being met by an outcry and moral 
condemnation. 
  Everything which has been stated enables us to maintain that 
the social price paid by society for the "shock therapy" has 
exceeded the maximum permissible limits. 
  The scope of economic and social calamities which 
Russia has endured presents a real threat to its national 
security. The country has found itself at a dangerous 
threshold, and if it crosses the threshold, it risks losing the 
chance to restore itself as a great power forever. 
  This is the result of 2 years of the "shock therapy" policy. 
  The most radical reformers justify the disruptions and 
sacrifices in every possible way as the unavoidable costs of a 
fundamental change in the political, social, and economic 
systems that have taken shape and Russia's "return" among the 
civilized countries. The Economics Department of the RAN 
[Russian Academy of Sciences] and the International "Reforma" 
Fund, on the other hand, are convinced that: 
  --no objective, including a new version of the "bright 
future," can justify the social sacrifices which the Russian 
people have made and to which they are unavoidably doomed if the 
chosen course is continued. The different approach is immoral 
and inhumane; 
  --the society which really exists in Russia today is 
very remote from the models which exist in countries with a 
highly efficient and socially oriented market economy. To a 
greater extent, it is a society based on excessively developed 
property stratification, corruption, organized crime, and 
foreign dependence. From a socioeconomic viewpoint, this is not 
a step ahead, but the country's throwback to 2 centuries ago, to 
an era of primitive "uncivilized" capitalism; and 
  --any programs to bring Russia and its social and 
economic system up to date can count on success only if they 
take into account, together with world trends, its originality, 
the distinctive nature of its history and culture, the spiritual 
legacy of its people, and an appropriate system of values. 
Russia does not need to return to world civilization--it has 
always been part of it and is still part of it as a unique type 
of civilized system. 
  Analysis of the course of reform and the results of Russia's 
socioeconomic development over the past 2 years makes it 
possible to draw a number of conclusions. 
  First. The deep crisis and the social problems are 
not the result of the unresolved problems, individual 
miscalculations, or the opposition of conservative forces 
(although all this had a place), but the unavoidable consequence 
of the course of reforms chosen and the methods of implementing 
them. 
  The attempt to solve all the problems "in one leap," by a 
"cavalry charge" was dictated not by sober scientific 
calculation, but by impatience and political ambitions. Despite 
the assertions of its initiators, this policy has been and 
continues to be highly idealized and it is being implemented by 
neobolshevist methods. 
  Second. After seeing the collapse of their chosen 
course of economic policy from the first steps of its 
implementation, the initiators of "shock therapy" did not learn 
any lessons, but continued to stubbornly insist on its 
continuation. This only aggravated the situation even more and 
brought new hardships for the people. 
  In order to conceal their fiasco, the reformers in power 
proceeded to engage in systematic misinformation of the public 
and misrepresentation of the true situation in the economy and 
the life of the people. 
  Third. From the every beginning there has been an 
erroneous orientation toward the decisive role played by foreign 
aid, and domestic sources to stimulate business activity, 
especially investment activity, have not been put into action. 
It became clear rather quickly that this was a major strategic 
miscalculation. The meager amounts of this continuously promised 
aid cannot seriously affect the results of the reforms in Russia 
under any conditions. However, even after this no serious 
adjustments have been made in economic policy. 
  Fourth. The claim of infallibility and possession 
of absolute truth lies at the basis of many of the errors 
committed and the unwillingness to change the course of economic 
policy, even after its complete failure was revealed. Hence the 
unwillingness to listen to criticism and the depiction of this 
criticism as allegedly coming from "the enemies of reform." The 
notion that there is no alternative for the reform but the 
strategy and tactics for implementing it chosen by the authors 
of "shock therapy" are being stubbornly imposed on public 
opinion. 
  Fifth. The unprofessionalism of the initiators and 
champions of the "shock therapy" policy has become obvious by 
now. 
  The public has encountered a new variety of subjectivism and 
voluntarism in the development and implementation of economic 
policy and clearly expressed ideological attachments in the 
policy itself. 
  However, there was a qualitative turning point in the 
people's frame of mind at the end of 1993. In the December 
elections, the people spoke out decisively against the 
experiments associated with "shock therapy." Only about 8 
percent of the voters supported the "Russia's Choice" bloc, 
whose leaders are the ideologists and champions of this policy. 
Continuing this policy even further means acting against the 
clearly expressed will of the people. 
  The Economics Department of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and the International "Reforma" Fund believe that in 
the name of restoring Russia as a great power it is essential to 
critically and honestly assess the results of the past 2 years 
and to work out a new strategy of social and economic 
reforms. 
<H5>  On a New Strategy for Social and Economic Reforms </H5>
  Selection of a strategy for socioeconomic reforms is one of 
the key questions of theoretical thought and political practice, 
and one of the most complicated ones as well. The problem of 
selection itself is based on recognition of the many variations 
and alternatives in social development. World and domestic 
experience has demonstrated the bankruptcy of notions about the 
unequivocal adherence to directions of social progress and about 
the existence of a certain "ideal model" of a socioeconomic 
system for all countries and peoples. 
  Choosing a strategy for socioeconomic reforms is a complex 
state and public process which requires not only thorough 
scientific study, but takes into account the will of the people 
and the consent of leading public and political forces and 
movements. 
  Certain basic principles in developing such a 
strategy: 
  First. Defining and formulating the social 
indicators of the reform: its objectives, as well as the limits 
which must not be crossed under any circumstances for any 
reasons (a guaranteed subsistence minimum, an employment 
threshold, a proportion of expenditures for education and public 
health in the GNP, and other factors). 
  Second. Rejecting naive faith in automatic 
normalization of the economy with the aid of depersonalized 
monetarism and restoring state regulation in its natural and 
generally accepted functions. The immediate steps, in our view, 
are as follows: 
  --shifting the emphasis to support for physical 
production and stimulation of business activity, including 
investment activity; 
  --working out an effective industrial policy, including 
a structural policy, to give the Russian economy an up-to-date 
appearance and increase the competitiveness of domestic products 
in the world and domestic markets; and 
  --ensuring the supreme authority of the law and 
developing well-reasoned and reliable economic legislation and 
stable "rules of the game," without which the subjects of a 
market economy cannot function successfully. 
  Third. Shifting to new principles for financial 
stabilization of the national economy based on elimination of 
disproportions between the material-substantive and 
financial-cost aspects of reproduction. 
  Fourth. Setting the objective of forming a single 
all-Russian market as a basis of the reform when the specific 
nature of the federative system in Russia is taken into account. 
This means shifting the center of gravity to local areas in 
implementing economic reform while the center retains the 
functions related to the formation and functioning of a unified 
market (development of unified "rules of the game," regulation 
of the circulation of money, common customs territory, and 
provision for the free movement of goods, financial resources, 
and manpower among the regions). 
  Fifth. Reexamining the role of foreign aid in 
reforming the Russian economy, using as a basis the strategy of 
orientation toward domestic scientific-technical and production 
potential and domestic sources of savings. This does not 
conflict with the course toward openness of the economy and 
Russia's limited participation in the world economy, but 
presupposes that it can and should basically resolve its own 
problems itself. 
  Sixth. A special role is played by the problem of 
changing property relationships. This is one of the principal 
directions for further development and expansion of the economic 
reform. The following are key approaches in the new strategy: 
  --overcoming the ownerless nature of property and 
finding a real, interested, and responsible owner for each of 
its forms (including the state form); 
  --gradual movement toward a modern, multistructured 
economy in which the most diverse forms of ownership are 
combined and supplement each other: private and state, 
cooperative and municipal, the property of public and religious 
organizations, foreign property, and the various joint forms of 
it; 
  --provision for an increase in efficiency and 
attraction of investments to expand production and modernize it 
should be among the chief criteria when making one decision or 
another about privatization; 
  --consistent curtailment of voucher privatization as a 
populist direction which is incapable of resolving the social 
justice problem but which increases the growth of inflation and 
the disorganization of industrial potential; and 
  --shifting the center of gravity from privatization of 
property to privatization of management as the most important 
condition for developing the activity of persons in a market 
economy. 
  Based on these fundamental approaches, a long-term state 
program should be worked out to change property relationships. 
It cannot be only the business of one department--the 
Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on the Administration of 
State Property]; it should be carried out with the participation 
of all parts of the federal executive authority, subjects of the 
federation, organs of local self-government, and other nonstate 
structures--pension, insurance, and charity funds, cooperative 
associations, and religious organizations. 
  The Economics Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
and the International "Reforma" Fund believe that the 
realization of all these principles will make it possible to 
change the guideposts of economic reform, to expand its social 
base, to minimize the social costs, and to retain the potential 
for revitalizing Russia--the quality of the people, education, 
medicine, culture, and basic science. 
  The basic stages of the economic reform. 
Achievement of the final objectives formulated above will 
require a long period of time. For this reason, it is important 
to determine the consistency and interrelationship of the steps 
being made, to have a kind of "network schedule" of the reform. 
Clear-cut division of the stages is also socially significant 
because it makes the real, practically achievable results more 
specific for the people. 
  Three stages in realizing the new strategy for Russian 
economic reform may be singled out in consolidated form: 
  The first one, the stabilization stage, will take roughly 2 
to 3 years. A combination of measures aimed at preventing 
further impoverishment of the people and the degradation of 
society is set forth as an absolute priority here. In the 
economic sphere, the principal tasks in this stage are: 
  --stopping the recession of production and embarking on 
the path of its subsequent upsurge; 
  --singling out "breakthrough zones" which make it 
possible to break the negative tendencies and achieve visible, 
socially important results (housing construction, solution of 
food and medicine problems, and so forth); 
  --stabilization of the financial situation and gradual 
reduction of the rate of inflation, bringing it to an acceptable 
level at this stage; and 
  --maintaining the potential of revitalization and 
economic growth (scientific-technical and personnel potential, 
advanced technologies, unique research and development, and so 
forth). 
  Priorities in social and investment-structural policy, the 
principles of tax, money and credit, and currency policy, and 
consolidated indicators for the budget and the volumes of 
critical imports purchased should be determined and adopted 
(with a guarantee of their stability) in the very near future. 
  Successful implementation of tasks in the stabilization 
period will make it possible to enter the second stage--the 
stage of major structural and institutional reorganization of 
the economy. It may take about 10 years. This time will be 
required not only so that the production volume before the 
crisis can be restored, but so that structural reorganization of 
the economy can be carried out and development of the subjects 
and infrastructure of a market economy can be completed. 
  Achieving the pre-crisis volume in the GNP when the 
structure 
has been renovated should make it possible to substantially 
improve the level and quality of the people's life and to smooth 
out the unwarranted gaps between groups of the population, those 
with the highest and lowest incomes. The growth of the size and 
relative importance of the "middle class" will become one of the 
important stabilizers of the social and political situation in 
the country. 
  By the end of this period, we can count on a substantial 
decrease in Russia's dependence on foodstuffs, the active 
participation in the foreign market of products from the 
processing industry, and full and steady convertibility of the 
ruble. 
  Performance of the tasks cited will make it possible to move 
to the final stage of the reform--completion of a model for a 
socially oriented market economy which is adequate for Russia's 
conditions and inclusion among the leaders of the world economy. 
<H5>  Structural Policy in the Current Stage </H5>
  Structural policy is essentially a tool for shaping the 
intersectorial and intrasectorial proportions of production and 
the most important factor which determines the efficiency of the 
entire national economy. An effective structural policy is 
possible only when definite prerequisites are observed. They 
include: determination of clearly outlined and formulated 
structural objectives; favorable conditions for investment 
activity; and the availability of mechanisms and institutions 
for the realization of national priorities. 
  These prerequisites are practically nonexistent at present. 
In this sense there is every reason to maintain that the 
conditions were not created over the 2 years of reform for 
conducting a purposeful structural policy. The actions taken by 
the government to resolve the vast number of private problems in 
the area of production and investment activity do not exceed the 
limits of current, practical regulation of the economy. 
  At the same time, the structure of the economy is changing 
spontaneously, and a number of negative trends have taken shape 
today. They include the following: 
  --a faster production recession in the processing 
sectors which determine the level of quality of the technologies 
being used (for example, reduction of electrical engineering 
output and instrument-making products over the 2 years by 42 
percent and a cutback of 40 to 48 percent in the products of 
organic synthesis); 
  --an increase in stress on the economy's structure 
because of the increased proportion of energy raw material 
sectors; 
  --a substantial and continuing increase in the 
power-output ratio of the national economy (15 percent in 1992 
and 5 percent in 1993); 
  --an increase in the proportion of gross output of 
secondary products and reserves (it increased by over 10 
percentage points over the 2-year period); 
  --a sharp decrease in the volume of capital investments 
(by more than one-half) and, as a result, a substantial 
acceleration of the aging processes of the production machinery 
and an increase in the concealed retirement of capacities (as of 
the end of 1993, the depreciation of fixed production capital 
was assessed at 58 percent and the level of concealed retirement 
of capacities by sectors was 10 to 15 percent); and 
  --the high rate of decline in the production of popular 
food commodities which ensure quality in the diet (by 43 percent 
in the production of meat and dairy products over the 2-year 
period). 
  In the opinion of the Economics Department of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences and the International "Reforma" Fund, all 
the trends cited attest to the rapid formation of an orientation 
toward raw materials in the Russian economy and the loss of a 
significant part of its scientific and technical potential. 
  Under conditions in which a dominant role in 
inflationary processes is played by cost inflation, it is 
impossible to combat it successfully by purely moetarist 
methods. Moreover, in such a situation the 
anti-inflationary measures aimed at limiting the money supply 
and reducing the budget deficit deprive the entire national 
economy of the opportunity to make efficient structural changes 
and lead to intensification of the production recession. The 
lack of investments does not make it possible to change the 
structure of technologies and thereby stop the cost inflation. 
  Under these conditions, only after changing the relationship 
of prices to basic products and resources and making the 
structure of domestic prices more appropriate for the structure 
of costs and the structure of the technologies which we have can 
the macroeconomic prerequisites be created for savings and 
expanding investment activity, the normal functioning of 
production, and an effective structural policy. 
  Accomplishing this task by further price liberalization, 
chiefly for energy resources, when the monopoly position of the 
main commodity producers is maintained will constrict the market 
even further and lead to a new upsurge in inflation, further 
production recession, and the collapse of entire sectors. The 
economy will be pressured by a new level of prices and the price 
relationships will turn out to be inappropriate for efficient 
structural reorganization. 
  A different path is more feasible--use of the traditional 
stabilizing measures applied in many countries in similar 
situations. This means the use of state price regulation methods 
in a given stage for those commodities which increase national 
economic costs to the greatest extent. 
  At the same time, it is important to note two circumstances. 
  First. Regulation of prices is not a repetition of 
previous methods of economic operation, even if the state 
resorts to it quite extensively at present (unfortunately, not 
within the system and purposefully, often under the influence of 
the lobbying interests of individual groups, without 
coordination with budgetary, credit, and investment policy, 
separately from the dynamics of incomes). 
  Second. The method being proposed for creating 
prerequisites for a normal reproduction process is objectively 
very complicated to implement. It will inevitably require 
substantial efforts from the state, those engaged in economic 
activity, and labor collectives. But under the present 
conditions, in our view, there is no other sensible alternative 
to it. Other variations, by increasing the "price" of 
stabilization immeasurably, may end up with a complete economic 
collapse. 
  The model we propose assumes the following sequence of 
actions: 
  --prices for a limited group of raw material resources 
and railroad tariffs are fixed for a definite period of time. 
The state liquidates its indebtedness to the sectors and spheres 
of the national economy; and 
  --after that, the relationships of prices and the wage 
level are normalized by means of the conciliatory process within 
the framework of this group. 
  The problem of indexing wages in sectors subject to price 
regulation may be resolved by using special wage regulation 
funds formed either with tax receipts from above-norm 
profitability or direct budgetary subsidies. 
  According to calculations by the Institute of National 
Economic Forecasting of the Russian Academy of Sciences made on 
the basis of appropriate models, the overall rate of inflation 
as the result of such measures may be reduced to 8 to 10 percent 
per month. 
  Over this period (2 to 3 months), the prices in other 
sectors 
move closer to the normative relationships. For the producers 
selling their products at free prices, progressive taxation is 
introduced for above-norm profitability. Sanctions for evading 
the taxes are toughened. There is revaluation of fixed capital 
or indexing of amortization allotments, with tougher conditions 
for their use. Tax exemptions are introduced for part of the 
profit being used for accumulation of fixed capital. 
  As a result of all the measures being proposed, the level of 
inflation may be reduced to 3 to 5 percent per month in 4 to 5 
months. 
  Probably other methods of regulating prices and stopping 
inflation are possible as well. In the event that the concept of 
regulation itself is adopted, the scientists and specialists of 
the Economics Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences and 
the International "Reforma" Fund are prepared to take part in 
developing a mechanism for its implementation. But at the same 
time, it should be remembered that disregarding the problem of 
prices in the national economy and postponing its solution is 
fraught with very serious consequences which may turn out to be 
irreversible. Time dictates the necessity of raising this 
problem and searching for a solution without delay. 
  There is no question that the procedure for adjusting prices 
to efficient relationships is extremely complicated. It requires 
very painstaking and skillful work. When efficient price 
relationships are worked out, it is essential to bear in mind 
that the world correlations are not suitable for us now. But the 
relationships of pre-reform 1990 are not satisfactory either, 
inasmuch as they will be playing a protective role with respect 
to obsolete technologies. It appears that a balance between the 
stimulating role of price proportions and the relative financial 
prosperity of most of industry is provided by the relationships 
of prices found between the current correlations and those of 
1990. 
  So the plan is to first establish a certain efficient 
correlation of prices with the aid of a definite selection, 
including administrative measures, and then "add on" the entire 
system of economic regulators to these correlations over several 
months. In addition, the psychological factor plays an 
extraordinarily important role. A step such as this, related to 
the regulation of some prices, is a kind of signal to all 
persons in the market that the state "is taking the game to 
itself" and is prepared to deliberately and purposefully shape 
the key cost and price proportions for a definite period of time. 
  The change in price proportions being proposed and the 
availability of significant unutilized capacities in our economy 
are still not sufficient conditions for stabilizing production 
and starting the movement toward growth. In order to reach this 
goal, an entire package of measures will need to be implemented, 
including the following: 
  --support for the solvency of sectors and enterprises 
(measures such as state purchases, guarantees for credits to 
acquire products, confirmation of resources for extension of 
credit, and the like may be utilized here); 
  --alleviation of resource limitations (meaning the 
sharp increase in imported components of investments in a number 
of resource-producing sectors, as well as the increase in 
imports of certain key products such as cotton, manganese, and 
bauxites); 
  --creation of an economic environment which stimulates 
domestic production (the creation of such an environment may 
remove the resource limitations themselves to a significant 
extent in a number of cases) with the aid of financial-monetary 
and tax mechanisms and a change in the principles of 
privatization and administrative measures; and 
  --state support for large-scale investments and those 
that are under way in the extractive sectors and 
agriculture. 
  In the initial stage, the defense industry conversion 
should play a decisive role in raising the technical level and 
restoring production volumes. The conversion of VPK 
[military industrial complex] enterprises accomplished thus far, 
on one hand, has meant imposition from above to use production 
potential to turn out civilian products oriented toward the 
system of management and directive distribution of resources 
that has taken shape, and on the other hand, it has consisted of 
production reorganization from below with orientation toward the 
technological specialization which has taken shape. This 
approach has led to preservation of the economic, legal, and 
information isolation of the military industrial complex and 
specific technologies of the VPK often have not been built into 
the existing technological lines and infrastructure of civilian 
production. 
  Under current conditions, we should not speak about the 
firsthand use of of technologies available in the defense 
complex, but the conversion of economic resources concentrated 
in it. This means the human capital--highly skilled personnel 
with habits of technological discipline, the potential of NIOKR 
[scientific research and experimental design work], and the 
transportation, power engineering, and social infrastructure. 
The economic resources of the defense sectors are adequate to 
meet most of the requirements for equipment of the fuel and 
power and other civilian sectors in relatively short periods of 
time. 
  Consequently, the main objective of national conversion 
should become technical reequipment of civilian machine building 
and increasing its capacities by changing the specialization of 
defense enterprises and bringing the production machinery of the 
main sectors of the economy up to date on this basis. The 
national nature of the conversion should create the 
prerequisites so that the result of the conversion's efforts is 
not the output of isolated types of equipment, but entire 
systems of machinery. 
  National conversion measures on a large scale are needed so 
that the defense complex's potential can begin to be utilized 
properly. They should include investment programs and the credit 
and financial support necessary for respecialization on the 
basis of privatization and stockholding. Entrepreneurial 
structures--banks, exchanges, and investment funds (including 
regional ones)--should be involved in solving the problems of 
conversion. Establishment of a multichannel system for financing 
the conversion through the market's institutional infrastructure 
will make this process commercial, and thereby profitable. 
  The following problems should be resolved as the result of 
implementing the conversion measures: 
  --an increase in the scale and qualitative level of 
technology to produce civilian durable goods based on wide 
expansion of technological and commodity cooperative activity 
with the defense industry (economically independent corporations 
with a network of small subsidiary enterprises for the final 
assembly of high-tech products); 
  --an increase in the production and expansion of the 
products list of equipment which provides the technology that 
accompanies social programs, scientific and technical research, 
and the purchase of equipment for public health, the ecology, 
and development of the social infrastructure; 
  --use of the defense complex's potential to overcome 
the structural and technological crisis in civilian machine 
building; and 
  --improvement in the quality of the specialized output 
of the military industrial complex, reinforcement of its export 
base, and a substantial increase in currency receipts from the 
sale of military and other specialized equipment abroad. 
  It is necessary to return once again to the problem of 
defining the long-range goals of structural policy. 
  Before the beginning of the currrent reforms, when the 
economy was relatively stable and controllable, the main 
objectives of structural policy were as follows: 
  --expansion of the consumer sector of the economy and 
increasing the public's incentives to work and reducing the 
resource consumption of the national economy on this basis; 
  --the technological leveling of the various sectors of 
the economy to reduce the outlays of resources and improve the 
quality of the end product; 
  --reduction of the investment burden by redistributing 
capital investments in the consumer sector and increasing the 
scale at which the inefficient part of funds are withdrawn; 
and 
  --linking up defense machine building (through the 
conversion) with the tasks of structural reorganization of the 
national economy. 
  Not one of these tasks was carried out. At the same time, 
they all continue to be important, as they were before. But the 
methods of implementing them are being changed substantially 
now. The main factor is that the state is not in a position to 
carry out such large-scale tasks independently. Conditions must 
be created for the display of initiative and self-organization 
not only by enterprises under all forms of ownership, but 
financial and credit institutions, the various funds, and broad 
sections of the public itself. 
  A national socioeconomic program which would show the real 
goals and resources in increasing national welfare can be an 
important factor here. 
  Substantial financial accumulations by the public should 
become an indispensable condition in realizing this program. An 
essential and immediate step toward this is the return of those 
savings which our citizens essentially lost when prices were 
liberalized. 
  Let us stress again that solution of one of the fundamental 
problems in the reform--the problem of structural reorganization 
of the economy--has been dragged out without justification. It 
has been postponed and made more complicated by the financial 
crisis and the uncontrolled production recession. Problems of an 
extraordinary nature--the attempts to maintain production and 
technological potential--have overshadowed the strategic goals 
of the reform in the area of structural policy. 
  As a result, neither the problems of an extraordinary nature 
nor the strategic tasks of structural changes have been resolved 
favorably. Moreover, the breakdown of production potential 
creates the danger that the resources which provide the 
opportunity for extensive structural reforms may be 
irretrievably lost. 
<H5>  The Course of Agrarian Reform and Its Prospects </H5>
  In the agrarian sector of the economy, an extraordinarily 
tense situation has taken shape which cannot be assessed 
unequivocally. 
  In analyzing world and domestic experience, the Economics 
Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the 
International "Reforma" Fund believe that the transition from 
one system of economic operation to another requires a 
relatively long period of time, especially in agriculture. This 
transition must include a preparatory period, first of all, and 
secondly, a transition period. 
  The results of 2 years attest to the adverse effect of 
improvised solutions and dictate the necessity of working out a 
clear-cut concept for implementing agrarian reform, with the 
obligatory separation of priority and secondary tasks, federal 
and regional tasks, and immediate and long-term tasks, as well 
as the stages for their realization. Despite the numerous 
decisions made by the government, we still do not have a 
complete program for development of the agrarian sector, even 
for the next few years. 
  As a result, the agrarian reform, which had the immediate 
objective of bringing agriculture out of the crisis situation, 
has even aggravated the crisis in a number of ways. The 
consumption of mineral fertilizers has decreased by roughly 
one-half as much. All the indicators of productivity in 
livestock raising have declined. Some of the pedigreed stock 
farms have been eliminated and selection is declining in seed 
growing. The disparity in prices for agricultural and industrial 
products is becoming acute: the gap between them nearly doubled 
in 1992. Capital investments for the entire range of work in the 
APK [agroindustrial complex] declined in the 1992-1993 period by 
69 percent compared with 1991, the gross output of the complex 
declined by 21 percent, and the production of foodstuffs was 
reduced by 27 percent. 
  The periods of time for stabilization and recovery from the 
agrarian crisis are difficult to predict because of the numerous 
factors which affect the status of the agrarian sector and their 
different behavior. Recovery from it may be difficult and 
lengthy. For example, this means dealing with the many years of 
land deterioriation, the harmful ecological consequences of an 
ownerless attitude toward natural resources and the land, and 
restoration of the rural demographic potential. 
  However, the socioeconomic structure may be changed and 
disproportions in development of the agroindustrial complex 
sectors may be eliminated in shorter periods of time. 
  In the area of land reform. The Edict "On 
Regulating Land Relationships in Developing the Agrarian Reform 
in Russia" issued by the Russian Federation president on 27 
October 1993 abolished the moratoriums on disposition of lands 
for all categories of owners and thereby established better 
conditions for beginning a legal land market. However, like a 
number of other presidential edicts, it was issued before the 
development and adoption of mechanisms to implement it. 
Logically, it should have been preceded by "The Fundamentals of 
Land Legislation" as the starting point, the basic document to 
regulate land ownrship and land use. Authorization of 
transactions for the disposal of lands should have been 
accompanied by the establishment of a procedure for these 
transactions, their taxation, the methods of assessing land, and 
so forth. 
  The land banks through which all transactions involving the 
purchase and sale of land, mortgages, and so forth, have passed 
could become the ones to arrange control over the disposition of 
lands obtained as the result of transactions. 
  At present, there is no legislation at the federal level 
which regulates leasing relationships in land use. In order to 
develop leasing, the parliament has to speed up consideration 
and adoption of the draft law "On Leasing Agricultural Lands" 
which has been prepared. 
  Changing the socioeconomic structure of the 
agroindustrial complex. With regard to kolkhozes and 
sovkhozes, a more consistent but careful policy has to be 
implemented for their real reform, not their "implied" reform, 
taking into account the social consequences of these measures 
and the wishes of the agricultural workers themselves. 
  Formation of the farm system, which included about 290,000 
farms by the beginning of 1994, has become an important 
direction of state policy. 
  We must continue active support for farming, the formation 
and functioning of associations of peasant farms; partnerships; 
subsidiary private plots; cooperatives for the joint use of 
equipment; and supply and sales, credit, and other service 
cooperatives which make it possible to perform economic tasks 
more efficiently. 
  In light of the radical changes in agrarian relationships, a 
fundamentally new look at the place, role, and nature of the 
transformation of subsidiary private plots (LPKh) is needed. The 
subsidiary private plots now produce a large proportion of a 
number of types of output, and they produce most of some types 
of products. In 1991, subsidiary private plots accounted for 28 
percent of gross agricultural output; in 1992 they accounted for 
32.6 percent, and in 1993 they accounted for 36 percent 
(preliminary data). The subsidiary private plots lead the other 
sectors in the yield of agricultural crops, the amount of milk 
obtained per cow, the amount of meat obtained per head of 
livestock, and the number of animals tended. 
  In view of the substantial importance of the subsidiary 
private plots in providing food for the public, the forms and 
types of state support provided for farms should distributed for 
these plots as well, in our opinion. In the interests of 
reinforcing assistance to the subsidiary private plots through 
local organs of authority, it is expedient to set up special 
funds to support the people's farms through deductions from the 
land tax and other local taxes and fees. 
  Amateur gardening, orchard growing, and livestock raising 
also deserves more assistance. Because it is aimed at food 
self-sufficiency, this assumes special importance in crisis 
situations, in periods of sharp increases in food prices, high 
inflation, and a decline in the living standard. Over the past 2 
years (1991-1992), 9.5 million families joined the ranks of 
gardeners and orchard growers in Russia. 
  In the agrarian economy, as in the entire economy, an 
efficient combination of state regulation and market levers is 
required. When there is an overall orientation toward free 
pricing, reinforcement of state regulation for monopoly 
commodity producers is inevitable. The state cannot completely 
refuse to regulate purchase prices at present, either. 
  In the area of finance and credit, the practice of 
financial subsidies which have no special purpose has to be 
discontinued. Funds must be granted on a repayable basis, with 
specific responsibility and for specific purposes. 
  Extension of credit on favorable terms to agricultural 
enterprises has to be maintained. This is especially important 
for beginning farmers who are expanding subsidiary private 
plots, as well as for new forms of agrricultural cooperation. 
  Peasants' regional banks, in which 70 percent of the 
founding 
capital belongs to farmers and farming organizations and 
enterprises, have been established and are now functioning. They 
can grant credit at a lower rate than normal commercial banks. 
However, replenishment of the founding capital with budgetary 
funds is required for the activity of these banks to continue. 
  The establishment of credit cooperatives is one more source 
for the extension of credit to peasants. 
  Interregional problems of the agroindustrial 
complex. The great diversity of natural, climatic, and 
other conditions in Russia's territory makes it necessary to 
take them into account more completely in forming a sectorial 
production structure for the agroindustrial complex and the 
foodstuffs market. 
  It seems expedient to form transregional corporations, 
especially where there are distances between the production 
stages of an end product. Transregional economic units could 
prevent the processes of agroindustrial production 
despecialization and alleviate the acute nature of 
intersectorial problems. Joint-stock companies, where regions 
would take part as co-owners of part of the stock shares, is a 
form in which they could exist. 
  Agrarian reform involves serious problems in the social 
sphere. 
  Social amenities and the maintenance and development of the 
rural social infrastructure require large financial 
expenditures. Local budgets are not in a position to finance the 
services field completely. Without target-oriented state 
appropriations for the production infrastructure (roads, 
communications, power supply) and social infrastructure 
(hospitals and schools), the countryside cannot manage, 
especially as the system of public education, public health, and 
general and transportation services has to be fundamentally 
transformed, taking into account the changes in the rural system 
of settlement and establishment of the farm system. 
  It is essential to provide economic incentive and establish 
favorable social and living conditions for the resettlement of 
rural families from regions in the Nonchernozem Zone and Siberia 
with a labor surplus, as well as to attract demobilized 
servicemen and refugees to rural regions with a labor shortage. 
<H5>  Money and Credit, Financial, and Taxation Policy </H5>
  The money and credit, financial, and taxation policy 
conducted in Russia in the 1992-1993 period has led to 
intensification of the crisis in the economy. The 
material-physical and monetary flows took place in a chaotic 
state of critical imbalance. The disorganized division of the 
USSR's economy without any clear-cut arrangements with respect 
to money and currency immediately led to collapse of the 
monetary system. The open inflation begun in January 1992 
actually grew into hyperinflation. The payments crisis and the 
production recession begun by it, which led enterprises to the 
brink of bankruptcy, are growing in the country. 
  The average monthly rise in prices in 1993 was 20 to 25 
percent, or about 1,000 percent annually. The Russian Central 
Bank's refinancing rate exceeded 220 percent. The financial 
"stabilization," which took the form of total insolvency of 
enterprises and the state budget (the debts to enterprises of 
the agroindustrial complex, agrarian workers, budget employees, 
oil workers, coal miners, residents of the North, and so forth), 
came into sharp conflict with the requirements to maintain 
economic and social stability in the country. 
  The actual volume of the money supply throughout 1992, 
according to calculations of the Market Institute of the Russian 
Academy of Sciences, declined to 35 percent, and taking into 
account the production slump and the "shrinkage" of the domestic 
market, it declined to 45 percent of the initial level in 
January 1991. Inflation of demand was lacking until February 
1992. The rate of increase in the monetary emission that had 
been indexed was unfavorable. This predetermined an abrupt 
intensification of the production recession. From May to 
November 1992, in order to resolve the nonpayments crisis, 
saturation of the market with the money supply was increased to 
60 percent; as a consequence of this, there was a substantial 
slowdown in the recession in the fall and winter of 1992-1993. 
However, the new deflationary measures that were taken led once 
again to the point that saturation of the market with the money 
supply fell to 30 percent. This was the cause of a new payments 
crisis and a new production recession. 
  According to data from the Russian Federation Goskomstat 
[State Committee for Statistics], the overdue debts owed to 
creditors amounted to R17 trillion as of the end of 1993. 
Enterprises were brought to a halt because of nonpayments, and 
particularly because of the insolvency of the state, which could 
not count on the fulfillment of state orders. However, the 
solution of the crisis being used today, by compulsory 
introduction of turnover in bills of exchange, the bankruptcy of 
debtor enterprises, and capitalization of debts, is leading only 
to a change in the titles of the debtors, not to the elimination 
of nonpayments in the economy. 
  Restraining demand, liberalizing prices, and bringing them 
closer to world prices have not stopped the inflation. 
  Money and credit policy. Under current conditions, 
the banking system should perform a threefold task: first, 
restore the state's controllability of the economy; secondly, 
create and implement a clear-cut mechanism for long-term 
investment of funds; and thirdly, speed up the development of 
market relationships in all sectors of the economy. In our view, 
the following system of banks correspond to the objectives set 
to the greatest extent: the Central (Emission) Bank, and 
investment and commercial banks. 
  During the period of extreme crisis, it is essential to 
strengthen the direct methods of state regulation of the money 
supply. They include: 
  --direct and firsthand control of the credit 
emission; 
  --control over cash turnover; 
  --regulation of prices and incomes; and 
  --regulation of foreign trade. 
  The state should strictly supervise and stimulate the use of 
credits according to their use priorities: food, medicine, 
housing, power, transportation, the conversion. Long-term 
investments should be stimulated by granting credits at 
favorable rates, tax exemptions, and stabilization of the 
ruble's rate of exchange. 
  The government's extremely severe financial policy 
has essentially wrecked the finances of both state and nonstate 
economic units at the microlevel. 
  The payments crisis is a crisis linked primarily with the 
loss of enterprises' working and fixed capital. In order to 
prevent a total standstill of production and implement the 
decision made on the reassessment of fixed capital, the monetary 
funds of enterprises have to be indexed without delay. At the 
same time, a special program to speed up the circulation of 
money must be prepared and carried out. 
  It is important to develop and implement a system of 
measures 
to combat inflation. We can make use of deposit accounts for 
large accumulations of money, bring the debt liabilities of 
enterprises into monetary turnover at the stock market level, 
develop forms of extending credit with a security note, and 
reinforce regulation of current market conditions and their 
factors, including prices and incomes (particularly by forming 
cartels, syndicates, and so forth, which operate efficiently 
under condtions of cost inflation). 
  In order to hold back inflation, pricing processes should be 
returned to state control. Together with the measures set forth 
previously, we have to establish a system of price agreements 
between producers, trade unions, and the government. 
  This means controllable inflation at the lowest possible 
level and a continuing rise in prices which exceeds the increase 
in incomes. 
  The Economics Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
and the International "Reforma" Fund consider it necessary to 
reemphasize that state regulation of prices for products of the 
TEK [fuel and energy complex], monopolist enterprises, defense 
production, and transportation tariffs has to be maintained in 
the transition period when a strategic course toward the 
preferred use of free market prices is maintained. In addition, 
the state should support parity of prices for the products 
turned out by agriculture and the products which it consumes. 
  The taxation policy of the government, following 
the lead of recommendations by the International Monetary Fund 
oriented toward "forcing out" debts from states with deficit 
budgets, has been aimed at rapid reduction of this deficit. 
Subordinate to this objective, it has been purely fiscal in 
nature, with a destimulizing effect on those engaged in economic 
activity. 
  The following should be included among the priority measures 
in carrying out a new money and credit, financial, and taxation 
policy. 
  First. Resolve the problem of budgetary federalism 
and create a capable mechanism for relationships between the 
Federation and its subjects in the financial sphere. It is 
necessary to provide for an increase in the proportion of 
territories' budgets in a common consolidated budget. This means 
redistributing incomes among the budgets at different levels in 
favor of the territorial budgets and reducing centralized 
budgetary financing at the same time. 
  The federal budget's participation in financing the regions' 
economy should be limited by the financing of federal regional 
programs and the allocation of subsidies and subventions to 
regions with a relatively low level of development and extreme 
natural and climatic or ecological conditions, as well as in the 
event of emergency situations. 
  The formation of independent budgetary systems--federal, 
republic (regional), and local--is impossible without consistent 
and clear-cut differentiation of the competence of federal and 
regional organs of authority with respect to the development and 
implementation of taxation policy. The transfer of important 
rights to subjects of the Federation with respect to the 
introduction of regional and local taxes and the setting of 
their rates has to be legally formalized for this. The Federal 
Assembly (parliament) of Russia should retain the right to 
determine the methodological principles for setting them and the 
list of taxes being collected for regional and local budgets. 
The limits of rates for these taxes should also be determined at 
the federal level, but their specific level may be set by the 
territorial authorities. 
  It appears that differences in regions' level of 
development, 
as well as the priorities in structural policy, must be taken 
into account in the stage of forming the income section of the 
federal budget, and that differentiated standards must be 
established for incomes from federal taxes which remain in local 
areas. 
  Second. Reconstruction of the ruined national 
economic investment field. 
  Together with the measures cited previously, we have to 
establish a network of state, joint-stock company, and 
cooperative investment banks for this. They are called upon to 
organize all investment and financial turnover and the issuance 
of long-term loans, including on the security of property, 
leased enterprises, and the purchase and sale of stock shares. 
  Third. Supply and marketing relationships between 
enterprises must be organized. Economic ties in a market 
environment are most effective if they function primarily 
through a system of large "wholesale merchants"--syndicates. Let 
us recall that during the period of transition to the NEP [New 
Economic Policy], the syndicates formed at that time began 
quickly, in several months, to replace administrative-command 
relationships with market forms between enterprises. This idea 
was combined with the unification in one structure of 
enterprises from various sectors with strict, consistent 
technological relationships. 
  Fourth. We need a simple and clear mechanism for 
taxing incomes and capital. It seems expedient to sharply reduce 
the total number of taxes. A clear-cut boundary has to be drawn 
between federal, regional, and local taxes. Differentiated rates 
should be set for the deductions from federal taxes for regional 
budgets... 
  Fifth. We need to reinforce control in Russia's 
banking system to bring about obligatory execution by commercial 
and investment banks of the Central Bank's directive on priority 
and preferences in extending credit to regions, sectors, and 
enterprises, and observance of economic standards and normative 
periods for payment and document transactions. Strict sanctions, 
to include seizure of licenses for the right to conduct activity 
in the banking structures concerned, have to be applied for 
violations. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Aspects of the Russian Reform </H5>
  In 1992, when the "shock" method obviously predominated in 
the government's foreign economic policy, the cutback in foreign 
trade turnover took place at an even faster pace than the 
production recession. The total volume of foreign trade turnover 
in 1992 was $76 billion, and it was reduced by 24 percent 
compared with the previous year. In 1993 the volume of foreign 
trade turnover was R76.2 billion [sic], that is, it remained at 
the level of the previous year. As a whole, this does not change 
the unfavorable trends that have taken shape in foreign trade. 
The result cited could have been assessed as favorable if it had 
not been achieved by substantially increasing the physical 
amount of commodities being exported, primarily energy 
resources, when there was a decline of 15 percent in contract 
prices for them. But the main point is that just as in 1992, the 
composition of exports and imports became substantially worse in 
1993. 
  Exports are being deindustrialized more and more because of 
the deep crisis in the processing industry, primarily in machine 
building. The composition of imports is also taking a noticeable 
turn for the worse. 
  The policy of attracting foreign investments, which could 
have had a significant effect in promoting investment activity 
in the economy if it had been successful, proved to be 
underproductive as well. According to certain data, the total 
volume of foreign investments in Russia was about R7 billion as 
of 1 July 1993. This is an extremely small amount. 
  The currency policy proved to be ineffective 
during the reforms. Accelerated introduction of ruble 
convertibility was its key component. It brought definite 
external changes into the economy, of course: the process of 
buying and selling foreign currency by both legal and physical 
persons was simplified, and experience in the currency markets 
and exchanges is being accumulated. However, the "shock" method 
of introducing domestic ruble convertibility when there is an 
inadequate economic, organizational, legal, and methodical 
foundation inevitably led to the rapid decline of the ruble's 
exchange rate. Repeated assurances by the government in 1992 to 
stabilize the ruble's exchange rate, initially at the level of 
20 to 30 rubles to the dollar and then 80 rubles, turned out to 
be incompetent and evidently were counting on International 
Monetary Fund resources to form a stabilization fund of $6 
billion, which were not obtained. In 1993, Russia came out with 
an exchange rate of more than R400 to the dollar, and it 
continued to drop, exceeding the mark of R1,500 to the dollar in 
January 1994. 
  The exchange rate of the ruble taking shape on the exchange 
became a guidepost in many respects in setting domestic prices, 
thereby promoting a surge in inflation, strengthening the 
dollar's position in the economy, and cultivating insecurity in 
the public consciousness about the national currency and 
avoidance of it. In perspective, if the government's currency 
policy is not revised, all these harmful consequences for the 
economy will not only be retained, but intensified. 
  And finally, in assessing the foreign economic aspects of 
the 
Russian reform, we cannot limit this sphere to distant foreign 
countries. 
  After the collapse of the USSR, the countries of the 
near abroad are now Russia's main foreign market, with a 
concentration of about 60 percent of its total foreign trade 
turnover. And it is very important that this is a market where 
its products are competitive. However, this is a more unstable 
and less regulated market in which pricing, payment and 
settlement, and other instruments for its regulation still 
differ from those accepted in world practice. 
  As a result, there is a continuing cutback in mutual ties, 
which is one of the main reasons for the production recession in 
every one of the new states without exception. Commodity 
exchange within just the CIS declined by nearly one-half in 1992 
compared with the previous year. This trend continued in 1993. A 
threatening, shortsighted reorientation of Russian exports from 
countries of the near abroad to more distant countries is under 
way. This is shown particularly clearly in the changing 
geography of energy resource exports.

  Similar processes are being observed in the export policy of 
other CIS countries, especially Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and Belarus, which may turn into heavy 
losses of markets for Russian industry, primarily its processing 
sectors. 
  There is no alternative but to reintegrate the economy of 
the 
CIS countries, in our view. This is in Russia's interests, as 
well as those of the CIS countries. Recognition of this 
objective necessity was expressed in the CIS countries' 
declaration on establishment of the Economic Union. However, the 
extensive political activity displayed in this direction will 
not have real economic results unless a realistic and balanced 
program of practical actions is placed under this document. 
There is no such program at present... Primary attention in 
drafting it should be devoted to solution of the following 
questions, in our view. 
  First. Substantiation for a model of an open 
economy as applied to the specific characteristics of 
Russia and its new geopolitical position, and most importantly, 
determination of the strategy and tactics for reaching the goal 
set by stages. The question of developing the process of the 
"openness" of Russia's economy by stages is important and 
fundamental. 
  "Shock" methods, as well as attempts to restore strict 
administrative measures, applied under the influence of 
transitory interests, should be excluded in all stages in actual 
policy. At the same time, and this is important to stress, 
foreign economic policy should have its own constant social 
component in all the stages. 
  Second. The question of openness and economic 
security. 
  Under the new market conditions, this question is much more 
complicated and covers a much broader scale than before. 
Obviously the objective now is to protect (insure) Russia's 
entire reproductive mechanism from possible unfavorable 
influences of world market conditions and to ensure that 
activity in the Russian market by domestic and foreign economic 
entities conforms to overall state interests. 
  Third. A key question in foreign economic policy has 
been and continues to be the development of exports and 
reinforcement of their foundation. 
  In the strategic plan, export policy should be aimed at 
selling commodities in the foreign market when the country has 
international advantages, at bringing out domestic enterprises 
for competition with foreign firms, and at increasing the series 
production (scale) of domestic output in order to "push it out" 
into foreign markets. It is obvious, however, that selection of 
a future "export basket" and the industrialization of exports 
cannot proceed spontaneously. 
  It is equally important that we not postpone creation of a 
modern mechanism of state support for exports--export credits, 
guarantees, risk insurance, and incentive for Russian 
investments abroad (including those based on the sale of debt 
assets), which will be able to form a basis for the country's 
participation in international production and the infrastructure 
to move domestic products into foreign markets. 
  On a practical level, it is necessary to further liberalize 
exports, minimize the application of quotas and licenses, and 
greatly simplify the licensing procedure. This is especially 
important for those commodities which are not sold in a reduced 
domestic market. In the near future we must sharply limit the 
fiscal function of exports (export duties) which is totally 
inappropriate for them, and later on, to the extent that there 
is a change in the level and structure of domestic prices, it 
should be completely eliminated. 
  Finally, it is essential to put the exports themselves in 
order organizationally and eliminate the elements of 
unprofessionalism, anarchy, and competition between Russian 
firms. 
  Fourth. The import policy needs to be fundamentally 
revised. 
  At the strategic level, import policy should be aimed at 
supplying the country with products which provide technical and 
economic advantages over domestic products, which modernize the 
production potential, which enrich the supply of consumer goods 
in the domestic market, and which supply us with products which 
are not turned out in the country. 
  For the purpose of stabilization, it appears to be 
absolutely 
necessary to maintain critical centralized imports for state 
needs (medicines, food, and complete units) for the near future. 
<H5>  [5 Feb p 3] </H5>
  [Text] The main practical task is to create a system of 
import tariff regulation that has been reasoned out thoroughly 
which performs a threefold function: optimization of imports, 
regulation of competition, and provision for budgetary 
interests. For this the government needs to be absolutely clear 
about which vitally important sectors of the economy must be 
protected, which areas of foreign competition should be 
regulated, and where it should be completely open to stimulate 
the competitiveness of domestic production. 
  Fifth. The nucleus of the new currency policy has been 
and continues to be achievement of real ruble 
convertibility. 
  In principle, the accomplishment of this task cannot lead to 
any objections or doubts. But it cannot and should not be done 
separately, but on the basis of stabilization of the economy and 
the state's finances and balance of payments--not all at once, 
but in stages. For this reason, in recognizing that the course 
toward achievement of real ruble convertibility is strategic, we 
believe that in the period under review the problem does not 
mean artificially accelerating this process, but putting in 
order the system of domestic ruble convertibility, which is now 
being speeded up, as a stage in the transition to its real 
convertibility. 
  Exchange rate formation and the establishment of efficient 
currency relationships between the state and juridical and 
physical persons is the central problem here. We are proceeding 
from the conviction that there can be no direct return to the 
currency monopoly of the past and artificial isolation of the 
ruble's exchange rate from the market. However, it is absolutely 
essential to limit the destructive effects of stock exchange 
speculations on the exchange rate and to put the mechanism for 
setting the exchange rate in good order. On a practical level, 
the following alternatives for a solution may be considered here. 
  The essence of the first alternative is to introduce 100 
percent of the compulsory sale of currency earnings in the 
market. This is an old idea, but it will not produce the desired 
effect under current conditions. 
  The essence of the second alternative, which we consider 
preferable in this stage, is to temporarily refuse to recognize 
the stock exchange's rate of exchange for the ruble as the 
official rate. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation could 
determine the official rate of exchange in the indicators of the 
actual price proportions of Russian exports and imports and use 
this as the accounting rate in all areas covered by state 
currency regulation: in calculating taxes, customs duties and 
fees, in determining the ruble cost of centralized imports, in 
evaluating fixed capital and foreign investments, and finally, 
in reflecting the foreign currency which banks and enterprises 
report in their accounts and the participation by foreigners in 
privatization. Such an official exchange rate could be adjusted 
regularly, depending on the exchange rates of foreign currencies 
being held, to which it would be expedient to attach the 
dynamics of domestic prices for goods and services as well. 
  Real support for the official exchange rate and expansion of 
stock exchange trade in currency would be a change in the 
current system of currency centralization, namely substitution 
of the compulsory sale of 50 percent of export earnings by a 
currency tax of 15 to 20 percent on it, leaving the remaining 
currency at the exporters' disposal. 
  In perspective, both exchange rates will draw together to 
the 
extent that an authentic currency market is developed, and 
conditions will thereby appear for the use of a single, real 
market rate of exchange officially quoted by the TsBR [Central 
Bank of Russia] and the shift to a system of 100 percent 
currency sales. 
  The version being proposed removes or limits all the harmful 
consequences of the "convertibility" analyzed above. 
  Sixth. The policy of attracting foreign investments 
requires drastic revision. 
  The accent here should be on attracting private foreign 
investments as one of the strategic directions of Russia's 
foreign economic policy in the foreseeable future. Foreign 
private capital brings in advanced technology and modern 
management, it expands the capital accumulation, and it 
contributes to development of the export base and import 
replacement without increasing the state's foreign debt in the 
process, which is extremely important under current conditions. 
  Seventh. Questions of foreign indebtedness and the use 
of Russia's foreign debt assets. 
  The accumulated foreign debt weighs heavily on Russia's 
foreign economic relations. However, the specific nature of 
Russia is that it is a major international creditor at the same 
time. It is highly unlikely that both of these debts can be 
settled by traditional methods. It has become necessary to adopt 
nonstandard forms of settling the country's liabilities and 
realizing its debt assets. Taking world practice into account, 
this problem may be resolved in the following ways: 
  --repayment of the debt by payment of coordinated 
compensation with a discount from the nominal amount; 
  --conversion of the debts into investments in its 
economy or the debtor's economy; 
  --the sale of debt assets (liabilities) in a secondary 
market; and 
  --reciprocal credit for liabilities. The possibility of 
large-scale reciprocal credit for Russia's debt liabilities and 
assets may be considered with the participation of the 
International Monetary Fund and the Paris and London clubs. 
  Eighth. The problem of relationships between the 
Federation and the regions in foreign economic matters is a sore 
point. There are still quite a number of areas in dispute 
here. The most important way to put this entire system in good 
order, first of all, is by simplifying its centralized 
regulation as sensibly as possible and freeing it of unnecessary 
red tape, which would automatically remove the question of 
shifting a number of farfetched regulatory functions to subjects 
of the Federation. 
  At the structural level, when there is a unified foreign 
economic policy the Federation's subjects could have the 
opportunity at their level to choose a sound export-import 
specialization for a region, develop a foreign economic 
infrastructure, and attract foreign investments, providing 
investors with local benefits within the limits of their 
competence. Together with this, Federation subjects should have 
their own marketable commodities to export for regional needs, 
their own currency reserves, including those for social 
purposes, and receive a definite share of the federal income 
from foreign trade originating in their territory. 
  Ninth. The course toward reintegration of the former 
union republics and formation of an Economic Union of the CIS 
countries, over the long term and from the standpoint of 
Russia's state interests, is most important and a top 
priority. Any other approach deprives Russia of initiative 
and authority in the reintegration process. At the same time, a 
CIS Economic Union canot be decreed or introduced through "shock 
therapy" by relying on the other countries' dependence on 
Russia. Its establishment can only be a voluntary process, with 
its own stages, and possibly its ebbs and flows. 
  Solution of the question of the CIS countries' settlement 
and 
payment relationships is most important among the urgent 
practical tasks. All the attempts (or their semblance) to form 
ruble zones of various types have failed. There is little hope 
that the different attachments to the Russian ruble by one or 
two states will be effective. In the current stage, a realistic 
and reliable path is to form a payments union of CIS countries 
on a multicurrency basis, based on the national currencies of 
the CIS states. 
  Immediate solution of the following matters is required for 
this: 
  --the principles and procedure for coordinating the 
exchange rates of national currencies; 
  --the procedure for equalizing the balancing of 
accounts between the countries' banks; and 
  --reciprocal convertibility of national currencies and 
the use of one of them (the ruble) as a collective payment and 
reserve capital. 
  A matter of no less importance is the presence of a stage 
preceding a complete payments union, namely a clearing union, 
whose operations should be entrusted to the Interstate Bank of 
the CIS which has been established. 
<H5>  The Restoration of Controllability of the Economy </H5>
  The almost complete loss of the economy's controllability 
has 
become an extraordinarily dangerous aspect of the current 
situation. The country has entered a deepening management 
crisis--there is practically no state structure remaining which 
has not lost its authority and been deprived of real levers of 
influence on the processes taking place in the economy. 
  It is a paradoxical fact that loss of the economy's 
controllability is taking place against the background of a 
sharp increase in the size of the management apparatus and an 
increase in bureaucracy in the process of preparing and making 
decisions. Corruption in government structures is intensifying 
rapidly. It is impossible not to see that paralysis of the 
management system is a result of the effect of both objective 
and subjective factors. 
  First of all, the primarily monetarist approach to the 
reforms gives rise to the illusion that everything is formed by 
itself to the extent that the economy is liberalized. An 
arrangement is being put into practice whereby self-regulation 
of the economy, which is being achieved on the basis of 
accelerated and widespread privatization, is to take the state 
out of management. 
  Secondly, obvious oversimplification of the tasks of 
managing 
Russia's most complicated production and scientific and 
technical potential is being permitted everywhere, inasmuch as 
the solution of all the problems in efficient economic operation 
is being erroneously linked only with shareholding and the shift 
to a different form of ownership. 
  Thirdly, disruptions in providing for executive performance, 
responsibility, and supervision in the management mechanism are 
directly linked with the fact that coordination of the reforms 
and many decisions is lacking because of the federal state 
system, the sovereignty of the republics, and the independence 
of the regions, and a clear-cut division of rights and 
responsibilities between the Federation and its subjects has not 
been worked out. 
  Continuation of such a system makes the development of any 
programs to extend the reforms, which are doomed to failure in 
advance, simply meaningless. Not one of the tasks to bring the 
country out of the crisis and continue the reforms 
constructively can be performed without overcoming the 
organizational confusion and rectifying the defects and disorder 
in the management mechanism without delay. The vacuum of 
authority which has taken shape should be completely filled by 
rehabilitating the principles of state regulation and by 
substantially increasing the level of controllability of the 
economy. 
  In this connection, top priority should be given to 
regulating the procedure for the use of federal property. 
This means clear-cut definition of the limits of the state 
sector of the economy, the division of Russian state property 
and the rights to dispose of it between the Federation and its 
subjects. The immediate tasks in this area should be: 
  --direct control of state enterprises not subject to 
privatization; 
  --development of the procedure for reorganizing and 
respecializing the enterprises being privatized and state 
supervision of this process; definition of the procedure for 
assigning managers and implementation of personnel policy; 
  --effective participation by representatives of local 
organs of control in the management of joint-stock companies, 
holding companies, and financial and industrial groups; and 
  --organization of the entire process of reforming state 
enterprises, including assisting enterprises to adapt to the 
market environment. 
  At the same time, the management and disposal of 
federally-owned facilities should be retained by the Russian 
Federation Government, which can delegate a number of powers to 
ministries and departments, as well as to the organs of 
executive authority of Federation subjects. 
  We cannot continue to resign ourselves to the fact that 
ministries and departments have essentially been taken out of 
the processes of reshaping enterprises, their privatization, 
formation of the vitally important market infrastructure, and 
influence on the consumer market. The role of the state should 
be to assist in the development of financial, legal, 
engineering, and consulting services, dissemination of 
information science, training personnel, and other aspects of 
infrastructure activity. 
  It is exceptionally important to provide for a link between 
enterprises' privatization programs and the goals for structural 
reorganization of the economy and financial stabilization, 
taking into account the specific nature of the sectors and by 
providing state benefits to the privatized enterprises in 
conformity with a selective structural policy. Finally, it is 
time to realize that privatization cannot be an end in itself or 
dominate over other directions of reform. 
  Widespread shareholding of enterprises taken separately and 
the abolition of large associations--concerns, economic 
associations, and consortiums--because of this raises the 
urgent question of the orgnaizational and legal forms of 
maintaining production and scientific and technical 
potential with the technical, economic, and other ties that 
have been established. 
  The imaginary struggle against monopolism is now being 
expressed in the forced fragmentation and elimination of major 
production and economic complexes, without which, as world 
experience shows, it is impossible to implement modern 
investment programs and make fundamental changes in scientific 
and technical development. 
  In particular, we see the solution now in the formation of 
financial-industrial groups, economic associations, and 
consortiums with the initiative and leading role of the state. A 
special role should be played by holding companies whose assets 
include controlling blocks of stock in other enterprises. 
  A key role in increasing the level of controllability 
is played by coordination and stability in the distribution of 
powers between the Federation and its subjects. It is 
fundamentally important to actually transfer the powers set 
forth in the Russian Federation Constitution to the regions. 
  From top to bottom through the entire hierarchy, it is 
important to reinforce units of the executive authority in areas 
such as employment, migration, antimonopoly policy, tax 
collection, and management of state property. In the interests 
of increasing the level of controllability and expeditious 
solution of current socioeconomic problems, it is expedient for 
the regions to have representations attached to the government. 
  So the analysis of the current economic situation in Russia 
conducted by the Department of Economics of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences and the International "Reforma" Fund shows that the 
market reforms did not produce the changes desired over the 
2-year period. This was not the result of individual errors and 
miscalculations, but a course which was chosen erroneously from 
the beginning to create a liberal market economy by "shock" and 
monetarist methods. The economy is in a critical state. The 
social base of the reform being conducted has been sharply 
reduced. Continuation of the course chosen will lead the country 
to a dead end. For this reason, we reiterate that this is not a 
matter of adjusting the course that has been chosen, but of 
working out new approaches to the strategy and tactics of 
socioeconomic reforms in Russia. We have proposed a conceptual 
view of them. 
<H5>  [8 Feb p 3] </H5>
  [Text] The economic reforms being conducted, as well 
as the actual steps by the government in this direction, attest 
to the absence of a specific concept of social orientation in 
the reform. It is being carried out not only without the use of 
the social shock absorbers needed in the situation that has 
taken shape, but without a forecast of the social consequences 
beforehand. 
  As a result, the adverse trends observed in the social 
sphere in the past have been intensified noticeably since the 
beginning of the reform, becoming very detrimental in 
nature. 
  The natural reproduction of the population is characterized 
by an intensive increase in the mortality rate and a decline in 
life expectancy. This indicator, which is one of the integral 
indicators of social processes, began to drop sharply in the 
early 1990's: it was 67.5 years in 1980, 69.2 in 1990, 69.0 in 
1991, 67.9 in 1992, and 66.0 years in 1993. Judging by this 
indicator, the society appeared to have been set back 15 to 20 
years, that is, to the beginning of the 1970's, and the 
principal factor in this process has been the steadily rising 
mortality rate of the people in all age groups. 
  The unfavorable age structure of the population from the 
standpoint of marriage and the birth rate, as well as deferred 
births because of the difficult socioeconomic situation, has led 
to a decline in the birth rate that is unprecedentedly low for 
Russia and a sharp decrease in the total number of births. The 
effect of depopulation has increased (since the end of 1991), 
expressed in the natural decrease in the country's population 
which is not covered by the increase in migration. While in 1991 
Russia had a population of 148.5 million, there were 148.3 
million permanent residents as of the end of 1992 and 147.9 
million in 1993. The natural loss was 219,000 persons in 1992, 
but 806,000 in 1993, that is, over three times as many. 
  The scale of the increase in the mortality rate, especially 
for reasons of a direct social nature, is creating justifiable 
concern. With stabilization (and even some decline) in Russia's 
population, 1.653 million persons died in 1990, 1.69 million in 
1991, 1.807 million in 1992, and 2.16 million died in 1993. The 
proportion of the total number of deaths from "unnatural" causes 
after 1990 rose from 12 to 15 percent. 
  A rapid increase in the mortality rate resulted from the 
increase in alcoholism, nervous stress, suicides, and murders 
due to crime. In 1993 alone, 10 times as many persons died from 
alcoholic poisoning, murders and suicides than during the 11 
years of war in Afghanistan. Unnatural causes led to the death 
of every third person of able-bodied age. The scale of the 
mortality rate from these causes is an indisputable indicator of 
the society's ill social health. 
  One of the important reasons for the negative changes in the 
dynamics of the mortality rate is the unfavorable ecological 
situation. In 1993, the content of pollutants in the atmosphere 
in 20 Russian cities was 10 times or more above the norm. 
Extremely high pollution of reservoirs (exceeding the maximum 
permissible norms by 100 or more times) has been observed in 
Sverdlovsk, Perm, Chelyabinsk, Murmansk, Orenburg, Kemerovo, and 
Kaliningrad oblasts. According to available estimates, 15 to 20 
percent of the premature mortality is the result of chronic 
illnesses caused by environmental pollution now. 
  The centripetal migration flows into Russia from former 
republics of the USSR have intensified sharply. The most 
critical socio-demographic problem is the problem of refugees 
and those who have been forced to resettle, looking for 
asylum in Russia because ethnic conflicts have intensified in 
places where they used to live. Over the past 4 years, the 
number of Russian-speaking refugees has reached 2.4 million, and 
2 million persons have been forced to resettle in Russia. 
  As of 1 September 1993, 352,600 refugees and persons forced 
to resettle were registered in Russia, which is 6.1 times as 
many as in September 1992. This means an increase in the rate of 
resettlement, and the overall potential for migration in the 
next 2 to 3 years (until 1995) is estimated at 4 million to 5 
million persons. The significant scale of unregulated migrant 
flows is making it difficult to provide the population with 
food, housing, and services, and exacerbating the unemployment 
problem. 
  The process of increasing unemployment is continuing in 
the country. Official figures in Russia as a whole have not 
exceeded 1 percent of the active population, although it is 7 to 
11 percent in individual regions. Hidden unemployment, in the 
form of part-time employment and compulsory unpaid leaves, is 
typical. In the first 6 months of 1993, over 4 million persons, 
including 3 million on compulsory leaves without pay, were 
working part-time. It is estimated that 7,000 to 9,000 persons, 
or 8 to 11 percent of the able-bodied population, are in the 
hidden employment category. The growth of unemployment is 
continuing in a stagnant form. The proportion of persons forced 
to be unemployed for more than 4 months was 8 percent at the end 
of 1992, but 52 percent of the total number of unemployed at the 
end of 1993. 
  The labor safety situation is getting worse. About 30 
persons 
are killed and more than 50 are crippled in production every 
day. There are about 400,000 accidents each year at enterprises. 
The level of industrial injuries is two to four times higher 
than the corresponding indicators in the developed countries of 
Europe. 
  The increase in inflation and poor wage protection have led 
to the point that the wage per employee in late 1993 (October) 
was only one-third of what it was in December 1991 (in 
comparable prices). A similar picture is typical for the 
dynamics of the public's per capita monetary incomes. 
  The situation with respect to a minimum pension is even 
worse. In October 1993, it was only one-fourth of the minimum in 
December 1991. The trends in the dynamics of basic allowances 
for children are similar. Their correlation with average per 
capita income in mid-1993 dropped by more than one-third (3.3 to 
3.7). 
  Today's standard for consumption of food products for most 
middle-income families is at the level typical for the late 
1960's and early 1970's. According to estimates, the level of 
meat and meat product consumption was 77 percent of the 1975 
level, the level of milk and dairy product consumption was 72 
percent of the 1975 level, and the level of consumption of fish 
and fish products was 75 percent of that level in 1993. While 
the proportion of expenses for food in a family's total 
expenditures was about 30 percent in 1990, it has climbed to 60 
to 70 percent on average today. For one-third of the population 
who are living on the threshold of poverty, this proportion has 
reached 90 percent of consumer expenses and it has deprived them 
of the opportunity to meet even the most basic needs for 
clothing or to obtain the simplest items and household articles. 
In the subsistence minimum of pensioners, food makes up 83 
percent and nonfood items, mainly essential items for health, 
hygiene, and medicines, make up only 10 percent. Most disabled 
persons can obtain only bread, groats, and macaroni products. 
But there is a sizable number of pensioners (13 to 16 percent) 
who find it very difficult to obtain even bread and groats. If 
their situation is not changed, we can expect an increase in the 
mortality rate of this group. 
  While most of the population seems to have been thrown back 
20 years as far as current consumption is concerned, a small 
group of families (about 10 percent) have seen their incomes 
increase. According to official data, the correlation of the 
average income of 10 percent of the richest and 10 percent of 
the poorest changed as follows: it was 5.4 times in 1991, 7.2 
times in June 1992, 9.0 in June 1993, and 10.4 times in December 
1993. 
  According to estimates of the Institute of Socioeconomic 
Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the proportion of 
poor persons (with an income below the subsistence minimum) is 
35 percent, but the proportion of destitute persons (with an 
income below half of the subsistence minimum) is 7 to 10 percent. 
  We cannot help but note a number of factors related to 
the misinformation given to the government and the people about 
the sociodemographic situation that has taken shape. 
  This primarily concerns the dynamics of real wages and real 
incomes. The Center for Market Conditions attached to the 
Russian Federation Government maintains that the population's 
real incomes are increasing. In this case, a number of methods 
are used, one of which is to neglect all the preceding periods 
and compare all the subsequent periods with January 1992, which 
was the month when wages dropped by one-third and per capita 
income was one-fourth of the previous level. 
  Another method, with which they attempt to show the increase 
in people's incomes in comparison with 1991, is based on use of 
the speculative and constantly changing exchange rate of the 
dollar. 
  The process of society's stratification is 
characterized by extremely unfavorable manifestations: 
  --the extreme intensiveness at which it is proceeding, 
which in itself is a negative factor which affects social 
processes and leads to social and psychological stress; 
  --the proportion of impoverished persons and marginal 
strata is increasing and the proportion of rich persons remains 
relatively stable, but the extent of their wealth is increasing, 
which aggravates the conflict between the poles; 
  --there is a common tendency of income polarization in 
the wages of socially skilled groups of employees, "washing 
away" the intermediate groups; and 
  --income gaps are formed mainly as the result of more 
poverty and pauperization of a relatively broad sector of the 
population. 
  Measures of social support implemented during the reform 
years do not represent a unified, well-considered system. 
Payments from the state budget are consistently late. First of 
all, wage payments are periodically delayed considerably, and 
this in itself is a violation of a person's rights; secondly, 
social security organs are not able to review the pensions every 
quarter; and thirdly, under the worsening crisis conditions, the 
state has proved to be unable to support a guaranteed level of 
earnings and pensions in conformity with the changing minimum 
consumer basket. The indexing of minimum earnings and pensions 
repeatedly promised to the people following the dynamics of the 
subsistence minimum has not been carried out. 
  The conclusion may be drawn that we are on the threshold of 
the social assistance system's breakdown as a social institution. 
  In practically all fields of vital activity, there is 
intensified discrimination against women. 
  The basis for this discrimination is the noncompetitiveness 
of the female work force in the labor market, since they are 
burdened with difficult social factors associated with their 
maternal functions. 
  So the conclusion may be drawn that the crisis has covered 
all areas of the public's life. The historic pattern of public 
consumption, with its own trends and traditions, has been 
broken. The effort to liberalize the social sphere has led to 
its degradation, and the introduction of liberal relationships 
in the distribution sphere has resulted in its complete 
breakdown as a system. 
  There has been and continues to be one solution--a socially 
oriented economy, that is, market relationships with definite 
limiters of a social nature. The basic principles of such 
limitations during the course of the reform may be formulated as 
generalized postulates. 
  First. The basic principle in developing a system of 
distributive relationships is reliable state regulation of the 
subsistence minimum, both from the standpoint of the 
methodology of its definition and the position of monitoring its 
changes under the influence of inflation. 
  Second. The state seeks to create the conditions to 
provide real opportunities for all able-bodied citizens to 
realize their right to a worthy life, guaranteeing protection of 
other rights and freedoms at the same time. 
  Third. The state provides for regulation of excessively 
high incomes through progressive taxation in order to 
prevent the trend of economic inequality from growing in society 
and destabilization of social conditions. 
  Based on what has been stated, the Economics Department of 
the Russian Academy of Scinece and the International "Reforma" 
Fund propose the following basic directions for social policy 
and the stages of their implementation. 
  First of all, it is essential to liquidate all the debts of 
state and nonstate enterprises which are related either to late 
payment of earnings or a payment below the legally established 
level. A repetitive fine for violating constitutional and labor 
laws in this field should be specified. This measure should be 
implemented in the first half of 1994. 
  Establishment of the subsistence minimum in a 
legislative procedure, defining clear-cut rules for its 
calculation, its changes in time, and applied to individual 
regions of the country, should be put into effect no later than 
the first half of 1994. 
  Movement of the minimum wage and social payments in stages 
closer to the subsistence minimum should be completed no later 
than the first half of 1995. 
  Implementation of housing reform by stages, including 
the provision of a minimum level of housing for all Russian 
citizens at the state's expense, presupposes: 
  --establishment at the federal level of minimum 
acceptable housing conditions (separately for urban and rural 
areas), below which regional authorities may not set their 
standards in the distribution of municipal housing; 
  --development of a system of privatizing available 
state housing to the extent that applications are received from 
citizens living in available state housing; 
  --expansion of the building of private housing through 
the provision of loans at favorable rates, the land, the 
materials needed, establishment of a mortgage mechanism, and the 
introduction and extensive use of provincial loans used to build 
and purchase housing; and 
  --rationalization of the taxation of middleman 
operations in the purchase and sale of housing; and the 
channeling of funds from such special-purpose taxes into housing 
construction for the dependents of society. 
  The legislative formalization of the appropriate standards 
should be put into effect in 1994. 
  The implementation of pension reform with the aim 
of establishing a three-level pension coverage: a social pension 
paid by the state budget, which is provided to all citizens of a 
specific age, regardless of their length of service, as well as 
to members of society who are not able-bodied; a labor pension 
from professional funds formed with deductions from enterprises 
with all forms of ownership; and an individual pension based on 
the creation of nonstate pension funds, in which mostly private 
savings are accumulated. 
  Reinforcement of the system of social benefits for 
all groups and sectors of the population which are not in a 
position to provide for themselves for objective reasons: the 
unemployed (specific periods of time), ill persons, the 
disabled, single mothers, large families with small children, 
and refugees. 
  An urgent measure that has to be implemented no later than 
the first half of 1994 is to establish a system of food 
assistance for those categories of people who are especially 
vulnerable and to expand the network of free dining rooms for 
them. 
  A system of multipurpose loans has to be developed for 
youths (16 to 25 years old) and young families: to acquire 
a vocation and improve skill, to obtain housing, and to provide 
themselves with property. 
  Reorganization of the public health system by 
stages in order to increase the effectiveness and quality of its 
service. Free medical attention at the level set by the state 
should be provided for all groups and sections of the public. 
Development of paid forms of health care should take place 
together with the free state assistance, but not in place of it 
and not on its basis. 
  Along with the measures to take effect over the long term, 
emergency solution of the most critical problems in the areas of 
sanitary and epidemiological insection, primary medical and 
emergency aid, and guaranteed provision of basic medicines for 
the public are needed in 1994. It is advisable to set up a 
special state fund to purchase the most essential medicines and 
medical equipment and to maintain the required level of sanitary 
engineering support for cities. 
  Social policy should provide for the basic types of 
education free of charge: general, secondary, and higher 
education, by financing from the state budget. Development of 
the different forms of paid education at all levels should take 
place together with this with the apporopriate supervision of 
the state and without detriment to the free education. 
  In order to increase the effectiveness and quality of free 
general education, a system of local public-state trustee 
councils has to be established to provide the supervision and 
patronage needed. 
  The unemployment problem requires special 
attention. We have to strengthen measures to provide full 
protection for those who are partly unemployed. The government 
should establish and be guided by an acceptable level of 
unemployment. This indicator should serve as a strict social 
limitation. We have to form a system to provide an acceptable 
level of employment in regions where unemployment is especially 
high and stagnant. 
  The main orientation of state actions in the field of 
employment should be preventive and warning in nature to stave 
off mass unemployment, as well as to expand opportunities for 
the employment of socially vulnerable strata of the population 
under the conditions of intensified competition in the labor 
market.
