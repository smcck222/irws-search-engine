<F P=106> [Article by Irina Demchenko: "Boris Yeltsin Between Gaydar </F>
and Chernomyrdin: The Prime Minister Racks Up Points"] 
  [Text] Boris Yeltsin has found himself in a position in 
which he is about to be confronted with the need to choose 
between the economic team of Gaydar and the economic team of 
Chernomyrdin. This situation, which is in itself unpleasant for 
any leader--specially since neither group has a stable majority 
in society--is aggravated for Yeltsin by the fact that he is 
politically dependent on both parties and cannot break with 
either of them. 
  The Russia's Choice team which united around Gaydar and the 
political group which associates with it and which formerly 
originated in Democratic Russia are, as before, the president's 
main political base. These people formerly brought him to power, 
supported him in all cataclysms and shaped the reform ideology. 
Who means what by "reforms" in our country may be disputed, but 
no active politician would today risk declaring that he is not a 
supporter of them, even if he has an affection for "nonmonetary 
methods." Abandoning the reforms would mean closing the lid on 
one's political career, and all leaders without exception, the 
communists included, are well aware of this. In this sense it 
may be said that reform ideology has acquired official status, 
as formerly did Bolshevik ideology. Essentially, only 
Zhirinovskiy permits himself not to swear by reform since he is 
the sole active politician who has his own ideology. 
  A paradoxical situation has come about: The party that was 
the founder of state ideology is in opposition to the executive. 
But neither the government nor the president here can "snatch" 
from Choice the monopoly of progressist vocabulary, which 
belongs to it by virtue of historical factors. Choice has the 
opportunity to blackmail a politician of any level with the 
stigma of "backsliding from the reforms," which it is 
practically impossible to wash off. But it is not only this fact 
that makes Yeltsin dependent on Gaydar's team. 
  For the president the symbols of the Gaydar-Fedorov economic 
policy are not only the domestic ideological base but also a 
calling card for the West. It is far from obvious that the West 
will accept a Russian president "bolstered" by the government 
that Chernomyrdin has formed with the same willingness for 
cooperation with which it accepted the president's policy as set 
forth by Gaydar and Fedorov. When it comes to money, creditors 
prefer to know for what they are being asked to fork out, and 
explaining to Western bankers what is meant by "nonmonetarist 
methods" will not, evidently, be easy. In addition, they could 
always solicit the opinion of the former members of the Russian 
Government with whom they have become accustomed to dealing in 
the past two years. 
  There is, in addition, the personal predilections factor. 
Burbulis, Poltoranin, Gaydar, Filatov, Filippov--these are 
people with whom Yeltsin worked in the closest contact for 
several years and to whom he has grown accustomed. Finally, 
against the background of the disorder, lack of organization, 
and squabbling in the democratic milieu Russia's Choice, granted 
all its internal heterogeneousness, remains, perhaps, the sole 
political current with a more or less solid structure. As yet, 
there is no one among the bloc's leaders who might constitute 
real competition for Boris Yeltsin at future presidential 
elections. 
  On the other hand, Viktor Chernomyrdin's positions on the 
Russian political Olympus continue to strengthen. The 
exceptionally abrupt opposition character of that same Russia's 
Choice and the support for the new government by a majority of 
the State Duma are, in particular, contributing to this. In 
addition, significant forces in the West that have tied their 
financial and political position to the Russian reforms have an 
interest in the impression of the notorious "staying the 
course," whatever this might mean, being sustained in public 
opinion--specially since the Chernomyrdin government was formed 
fully in accordance with both legislation and the results of the 
expression of the public's pleasure. To which, incidentally, the 
vagueness of the wording of which the premier is culpable when 
talking about his future intentions contributes perfectly. 
  All these and certain other factors are causing Viktor 
Chernomyrdin to become an increasingly independent and strong 
political figure, whose legitimacy is no longer based on the 
authority of the president who nominated him but on an entirely 
different base. The ingredients of this base are the support of 
the power ministries and the solitariness and even a certain 
harassment of the ministerial cabinet by public opinion 
contributing to the development of a spirit of the corporate 
identity and consolidation of members of the government around 
the leader and also the dependence on the executive of a 
president who lacks a majority in parliament. 
  In addition, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who just a year ago was a 
passing and quite incidental candidate for the office of 
premier, is increasingly laying claim to the position of 
Yeltsin's main rival at the future presidential elections, 
although he is comporting himself with pronounced loyalty. The 
abolition of the office of vice president has not, it would 
seem, permitted a fundamental solution of the problem of 
internal competition: Now the premier is "racking up points" 
among his electorate at a furious pace. 
  Although the presidential elections are still a long way 
off, 
the president will, possibly, have to make his choice in the 
very near future: The interests of the two groupings are 
clashing increasingly powerfully. Viktor Chernomyrdin is 
interested in Boris Yeltsin continuing to maneuver for as long 
as possible, and Gaydar's team, in Yeltsin disavowing 
Chernomyrdin as soon as possible and restoring the former 
alliance with Choice. It is significant that, as the date of the 
presidential elections approaches, the polarity of these 
interests will, most likely, change--Viktor Chernomyrdin could 
prove interested in the present president being responsible for 
the difficulties of the market reform.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Grigoryev: "Russia's Currency Market Is </F>
Threatened With Paralysis"] 
  [Text] "A duty on transactions concerning the buying and 
selling of currency" is to be introduced in Moscow as of 1 
March. It is assumed that the city budget will receive 0.1 
percent of the sum of all exchange currency transactions. 
  In the new year the capital's authorities are very actively 
implementing the right granted by the presidential edict to 
introduce additional territorial taxes and duties. In this case, 
however, it is not quite clear who, in fact, will be the 
taxpayer. It is obvious that transactions on the Moscow 
Interbank Currency Exchange will become the basic taxation 
object. Meanwhile, about 30 percent of the banks participating 
in the currency auctions of the Moscow Interbank Currency 
Exchange are not registered in Moscow and the local Moscow tax 
cannot be applied to them. If the Moscow Interbank Currency 
Exchange becomes the taxpayer, it will have to double the amount 
of the exchange duty. (The rate of the commission collected by 
the exchange now makes up the same 0.1 percent of the 
transaction.) The commission of most dealer banks, which 
declined significantly last year, as of today fluctuates within 
0.3 to 1 percent. As a result of the introduction of the new 
tax, the cost of services connected with the buying and selling 
of currency will increase by 10 to 30 percent. The management of 
the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, holding consultations 
with a number of exchange members, believes that this can lead, 
at least temporarily, to the curtailment of exchange trade. 
  It is obvious that any malfunctions and pauses in the 
operation of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, even if 
they are due to purely technical reasons, lead to the 
destabilization of the entire currency market and are 
immediately reflected in the rate of the ruble. Thus, however 
paradoxical it may seem, the new tax will have an unfavorable 
effect on the entire Russian economy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Stock Exchange: Results and </F>
Prospects: `The Year of the Central Exchange' Has Not Yet 
Arrived"] 
  [Text] Today we can ascertain with complete certainty 
that the Moscow Central Stock Exchange (MTsFB) has grown into a 
developed national structure that operates not only throughout 
all of the Russian Federation, but in the international arena as 
well, expanding cooperation with the stock exchanges of the 
U.S., Western Europe, and Asia. The MTsFB is a type of practical 
training ground for the processing of Western technologies in 
the spheres of trading and clearing and deposit services. What 
was last year like for the Russian securities market and for the 
MTsFB in particular? 
  Despite certain successes, the securities market in Russia 
continues to retain features of a small, developing market in 
which primary placing of orders is predominant and the volume 
and liquidity of the secondary market are still extremely low. 
The basic features of the contemporary stock market include the 
absence of a precise, formulated plan of development, an 
underdeveloped material base and infrastructure, a high risk 
level related to securities, and the absence of optimal 
regulation by the government. The general condition of the 
contemporary Russian securities market attests to its 
rudimentary nature and to the unavoidability of rises and falls 
in the near future. Nevertheless, this development should be 
considered an important factor in stabilizing the country's 
economic situation. 
  "To be perfectly frank, the past year has failed to live up 
to our expectations," states Vyacheslav Pankin, MTsFB president. 
"In analyzing the tendencies that were then revealing 
themselves, I thought that we would be able to call 1993 the 
`year of securities' with all justification. The burgeoning 
growth of privatized enterprises spoke in support of this and 
promised a great issuance of stocks and other securities. In 
actuality the market did begin to fill with securities. Some 
banks have already issued stock ten times, but major politics 
interfered. You probably remember -- the long opposition of the 
executive and legal authorities, and then the high levels of 
inflation. The government was more involved in politics than in 
economics. As a result, many potential investors preferred not 
to take risks and worked in short-term markets. The rise of the 
securities market that we had counted on did not materialize." 
  Despite the MTsFB president's fairly restrained assessment 
of 
last year, it should be noted that it was nevertheless a year of 
significant events. 
  One of the first steps taken by the exchange in the 
direction 
of implementing contemporary principles of stock trading was the 
development of fairly strict rules on listing -- the procedure 
for placing securities on the market for trading based on an 
analysis of the issuer's financial condition. The basis for 
these rules was the listing regulations of the leading stock 
exchanges of the world. 
  The MTsFB moved toward this consciously, despite the risk of 
losing potential issuers, who might be attracted by the more 
liberal rules of other exchanges. Immediately following the 
introduction of this procedure the turnover in securities on the 
MTsFB decreased. Whereas in August-September 1991 the volume of 
transactions on the exchange comprised 271.8 million rubles, in 
1992 it equalled only 74.9 million rubles for the entire year. 
However, today the MTsFB, having passed through the unavoidable 
period of decreased sales volume, has once again become one of 
the most highly liquid secondary markets in Russia. In the 
course of last year the market sold securities worth 779.3 
million rubles, which is greater than 1992 volumes by a factor 
of more than 10. Opportunities have arisen to establish real 
balanced supply and demand prices. 
  Leading experts from the finance ministry, 
Goskomimushchestvo 
[State Property Committee] and the Russian Fund on Federal 
Property, and representatives of the exchange's stockholders 
have been recruited for work on the MTsFB committee. As of 20 
July 1993, the date of the first committee meeting, the register 
of securities quoted on the MTsFB has included the stock of 39 
of the largest commercial banks, industrial enterprises and 
trade companies representing all regions of Russia. The results 
of operations involving securities that are listed on the MTsFB 
comprised 164 million rubles (35 percent of total volume of 
transactions). 
  In May 1993 the MTsFB exchange council confirmed changes in 
the "Regulations for Listing Securities for Exchange Trading and 
for Exclusion From Trading on the MTsFB." This document 
stipulates that issuances and stock transactions not recorded in 
the exchange in the course of three months are transferred into 
the so-called "waiting zone," and after 3 months have elapsed if 
no transactions have taken place involving the stocks in 
question, the issuances will be subject to a delisting procedure. 
  Thus in September 1993 the number of MTsFB listings 
decreased 
by four. The stock of Kuzbassbank, SVAKbank, Unikombank and the 
GUM [State universal store] Trading House were placed into the 
"waiting zone." As a result, during the year the stock exchange 
index for stocks included on the MTsFB register equalled 
2207.61. Its peak level (9523.81) occurred in March, and the 
lowest figure (1724.14) was seen in February, when only three 
transactions worth 200,000 rubles were carried out on the basis 
of 116 stocks. 
  Many factors contributed to the growth in trading on the 
MTsFB. Up until the summer of 1993 securities trading on Russian 
exchanges increased primarily as a result of voucher operations. 
A considerable increase in securities trading began in June. 
Each month the proportion of operations involving vouchers 
decreased and that of operations involving other forms of 
securities increased. For example, in August the MTsFB carried 
out extensive transactions worth over 317 million rubles in the 
financial bill market. It is evident that with the lengthening 
of the stabilization period for the ruble exchange rate the 
participants in the financial market began to seek new spheres 
for supplementing their capital. Among the internal factors that 
affected the pace of growth in trading volume is the 
organization of daily trading in the MTsFB's own operations hall 
on Ilinka Street near central Moscow's Birzhevaya Square [Stock 
Exchange Square], the historic name of which was restored thanks 
to the initiative of the MTsFB. 
  Within the MTsFB structure of transactions involving 
different groups of securities, stocks (54.5 percent of total 
sales in 1993) and the bill market (43.8 percent) clearly 
dominate. The MTsFB administration has expressed satisfaction at 
this fact since stocks are traditionally the number one 
commodity for stock exchanges, and the bill market is a new form 
of debt securities for the Russian market at the same time that 
it is an integral part of trading on classical stock exchanges. 
The insignificant proportion of options (0.001 percent) on the 
MTsFB corresponds to the general underdevelopment of the futures 
and options markets in Russia. 
  Within the stocks group, bank stocks are unreservedly 
predominant (61.3 percent). The interest in bank stocks is 
stable, and practical experience has shown that trading in the 
stock of one bank will invariably be replaced by interest in the 
stock of another bank. It should be noted that the orientation 
of investors primarily towards the bank sphere has been observed 
for over a year now. The basis for this tendency is the great 
regularity in the transition from one sphere to another during 
the development of a market economy. The stage of initial 
accumulation of capital, for which the predominance of trading 
capital is characteristic, is over. The effectiveness of 
investing assets in intermediate trading structures has 
decreased steadfastly during the last year. As a result, bank 
stock has replaced stock from exchanges and other structures 
representing the intermediate trading sector, which was more 
popular in 1991 and early 1992. 
  Second in transaction volume is a group of stocks from 
trading houses and trading companies, consisting primarily of 
securities from Mikrodin Company, which sells fairly large 
blocks of 50 to 200 shares. 
  According to Vyacheslav Pankin, one of the main conceptual 
problems today is what model to select for further development 
of the stock exchange in Russia -- the American or the European. 
Existing law favors a mixed form. But then it will be possible 
to say with all certainty that in coming years banks will crowd 
from the market all securities of small brokers. At present, 
however, banks themselves prefer to be involved in the issuance 
of their own stock and to give credit for earned capital. 
  According to a decision by the exchange council, this year 
it 
is planned to introduce a "short money" exchange on the MTsFB, 
futures contracts in SKV [freely convertible currency] and check 
auctions. Electronic trading methodologies will be perfected. 
The problems of accounting for securities in depositories and 
the implementation of a register for stockholders will be dealt 
with. 
  Among the basic priorities is the restoration of a building 
which was transferred to the exchange's balance by the Moscow 
government and which is an architectural monument. It is planned 
to allocate about $10 million for its restoration. Moreover, two 
commercial banks will be partners in this matter, which once 
again attests to the fairly high rating of the MTsFB in Russia's 
business world. 
  To my question as to whether in the future security issues 
from the republics of the former USSR which have entered the 
ruble zone would be quoted on the exchange, Mr. Pankin answered 
that in principle this has not been excluded. However, at the 
present time due to the high level of inflation in these 
republics it is quite unlikely. Naturally, they would begin in 
the "waiting zone."

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Smolenskiy, president of the </F>
Stolichnyy Commercial Bank, Moscow, by DELOVOY MIR correspondent 
Marina Talskaya, under the "Interview of Current Interest" 
rubric; place and date not given: "It Is Time To Switch From 
Politics to Business"] 
  [Text] Despite all efforts to obtain information on 
interaction with commercial banks in the past year, 1993, from 
the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, we have not 
succeeded in doing this. Meanwhile, at present this is one of 
the most significant problems for commercial banks. We had to 
use the services of authors who are directly or indirectly 
wrapped up in the issue, and whose opinions we present today. 
  It is a pity that the press service of the Central Bank 
of the Russian Federation does quite a poor job in assisting 
trade publications with the organization of interviews and other 
materials devoted to the operation of the banks. One gets the 
impression that the service was not organized to establish close 
relations with the press but, on the contrary, to isolate the 
press from interesting interlocutors from the Central Bank of 
the Russian Federation. At times, it takes weeks or months to 
arrange a particular meeting. As a result, an issue of current 
interest takes care of itself: In our fast-paced times, topics 
become obsolete by the hour rather than by the day. 
  On this score, the commercial banks of Moscow and other 
Russian cities differ favorably from the Central Bank. 
  One is only left hoping that the situation here will 
change for the better. After all, it is in our common interest. 
  Aleksandr Smolenskiy, president of the Stolichnyy 
Commercial Bank, is known as a consistent critic of Central Bank 
operations. It is up to the readers to judge how well his 
criticism is substantiated. 
  [Talskaya] The year has ended. What did it amount to for the 
banking system of Russia? How did the commercial banks develop? 
How did the policy of the Central Bank influence their 
operations? 
  [Smolenskiy] The Central Bank of Russia has not been 
emancipated from political activities, at any rate not before 31 
December. It is carried away by such activities, as I see 
it--excessively. Besides, the Central Bank is overly 
emotional--there are leaps and bounds. So far, a Central 
Bank--such as the national bank of a mighty state, such as 
Russia, should be--has not been created yet. 
  On one occasion, I was driving along Pyatnitskaya Street. 
There was a building without a sign, and a waiting line. I was 
curious what people could be lining up for now. It turned out 
that a financial company was accepting deposits from the 
population. Fantastic! Deposits of the population involve pure 
banking activities. The delineation should be strictly upheld. 
After all, it does not occur to me to bake pies or sew boots. It 
is the function of precisely the Central Bank to put an end to 
the attempts of impostors to engage in banking activities. 
  In general, the entire Western banking ideology is built on 
the protection of individual depositors. In our country, the 
overall mentality of the state is such that private individuals 
so far mean nothing to it. 
  The saddest part is that the Central Bank has still failed 
to 
lay a precise normative foundation regulating the operations of 
commercial banks. 
  [Talskaya] Many bankers complain about this. Nonetheless, 
everyone appears to be alive.... 
  [Smolenskiy] I would not be that categorical. According to 
my 
estimates, more than 50 banks are bankrupt and unable to honor 
their obligations (in the absence of proper auditing and review, 
we have to proceed solely from our knowledge of our "inner 
workings"). As a rule, they have unauthentic balances, which 
nobody is in a position to verify. 
  [Talskaya] Effective in the New Year, commercial banks will 
switch to a Western accounts chart. May this partially resolve 
the issue of the authenticity of balance sheets? 
  [Smolenskiy] This will not reverse the situation. That 
superfluous statistics will be removed from the balance sheets 
is the only improvement associated with the present innovation; 
however, balance sheets will still remain a dark jungle. 
  It appears to me that the Central Bank should work on this 
issue very seriously. All bankers are interested in putting 
reports in order because at present we operate on the interbank 
market blindly. Our partners may provide us with a heap of 
documents; however, I will not be completely certain whether 
this bank exists in reality or only on paper. Meanwhile, a chain 
of bankruptcies will result from any mishap. If banks go under, 
we may close down the entire national economy. 
  [Talskaya] At a press conference on the eve of the new year, 
Viktor Gerashchenko mentioned resolving the issue of the 
turnaround of payments as one of the definite accomplishments of 
the Central Bank last year. Do you agree with his opinion? 
  [Smolenskiy] No. Funds travel for 72 hours within Moscow. 
This is very long. The volume of the Moscow Cash Clearing Center 
comes approximately to upwards of 1 trillion rubles [R]. For 
three days, this money sinks to the bottom and exists on paper 
and as bookkeeping entries. 
  I also disagree with the view of the Central Bank that 
settlements should be effected by "his majesty's" office. I 
believe that this should be done by some unit established 
jointly with commercial banks. 
  [Talskaya] During the entire year, there was talk about 
converting the Cash Clearing Center to joint-stock operations. 
  [Smolenskiy] Unfortunately, it was just talk. I believe that 
settlement hubs should be converted to joint-stock operations, 
with the Central Bank holding the controlling share. 
  [Talskaya] Throughout last year, the Central Bank kept 
postponing auctions to sell centralized resources. Many bankers 
believe that unequal access to these funds infringes on the 
rights of commercial banks. Are you one of them? 
  [Smolenskiy] We have never used centralized resources and 
apparently will not use them, because the Central Bank restricts 
these funds in a number of ways, in particular, with regard to 
interbank credit. I do not need an extra headache because of 
R100 million-R150 million. 
  Besides, centralized credit is earmarked for economically 
weak enterprises and organizations. As a rule, they are not in a 
position to pay back credit, because they hand out one-half of 
it as wages right away. So am I to sort this out with the 
workers? Or to buy this factory myself? 
  Thank God, the auctions were not held. The plan was patently 
without promise. It appears to me that an arrangement on which 
the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank recently agreed is 
more acceptable: Contracts will be signed on behalf of the state 
directly with commercial banks, which will, in turn, service 
state programs. The Central Bank should not and will not engage 
in the distribution of centralized resources. It will extend 
credit to the state, and let the latter sort things out itself. 
This procedure will lighten the load of the Central Bank 
considerably. 
  [Talskaya] Nonetheless, you are the first one from among my 
interlocutor-bankers who has no regrets about the auctions. 
  [Smolenskiy] You see, the receipt of this kind of money 
corrupts the personnel. They stop using their heads. Why? The 
bosses will go to an auction and win everything. I think that 
the banks that do not want to do the homework themselves yearn 
for centralized resources. 
  [Talskaya] How did an increase in the discount rate to 210 
percent influence banking activities? 
  [Smolenskiy] Ideally, it should have made credit resources 
contract. However, everything remained as it used to be. The 
people creaked, groaned, and calmed down. 
  A profit margin of no less than 1,000 percent should be 
built 
in from the beginning in order to start some kind of enterprise 
at present. Ultimately, the interest on bank credit is paid by 
the consumer; it is included in the price. 
  [Talskaya] An increase in the minimum size of statutory 
capital to R100 million has caused much talk in the banking 
community. Many of your colleagues believe that compliance by a 
bank with standards for proprietary and attracted funds is the 
main point in banking operations, rather than the volume of 
statutory capital as such. 
  [Smolenskiy] I do not agree with them. What does R100 
million 
amount to at present? It is $90,000. Meanwhile, according to the 
Basel international convention, the minimum statutory capital of 
a bank should be equivalent to $5 million. This number was not 
pulled out of a hat. Depositors must be sure that the bank is 
reliable. I believe that the plank of the minimum statutory 
capital of banks in Russia should be raised, and raised again. I 
am in favor of free competition among banks. However, as I see 
it, small, unreliable banks do nothing but discredit the banking 
system. What was possible in 1988, during the emergence of 
banks, is impermissible in 1993, to say nothing of 1994. 
  You have mentioned standards. With a statutory capital of 
R100 million, a bank may have R2 billion in attracted funds. 
Given current prices, this is a whole lot of nothing! 
  [Talskaya] Effective 1 January, foreign-exchange regulation 
will take effect in Russia. How would you comment on this event? 
  [Smolenskiy] The national currency should be the only tender 
in the territory of a country. In our country, the ruble is such 
currency. 
  Certainly, the decision of the Central Bank which 
discontinues the parallel circulation of currencies is correct. 
However, I am afraid that in this instance we will not do 
without excesses, either. I think that the citizens will not 
believe the promise that, at any moment, it will be possible to 
buy currency on the exchange, and that its exchange rate will 
change smoothly, without leaps and flip-flops. There have 
already been too many declarations that the state subsequently 
repudiated without batting an eye. 
  [Talskaya] Let us assume that you have an opportunity to 
influence the development of the banking system in the country. 
Where would you begin? 
  [Smolenskiy] Communications are the foremost point both for 
the national economy in general and banking operations in 
particular. If there are no communications, we will be done in. 
Information is now becoming more compact. The introduction of an 
electronic communications system would fundamentally change the 
ideology of interbank relations. Having automated the banking 
business, we would have pulled along the rest of the national 
economy. At present, close to R1.5 trillion "floats" somewhere 
around Russia in postal money orders every day. If we had normal 
communications, we could extend credit to someone in Vladivostok 
while Moscow is asleep. Except for us, the entire world makes 
money on time zone differences. I do not mean specifically our 
bank. We have found an opportunity to take advantage of time 
differences. 
  I am not saying that the Central Bank should solve this 
problem alone. Commercial banks are prepared to help it. 
  In the greater scheme of things, I believe that Gerashchenko 
lacks a team. For some reason, he is afraid of young people. The 
chairman of the Central Bank himself is an international banker, 
and all Russian "narrow" issues obviously annoy him. Apparently, 
the problems we are struggling to solve have long been solved in 
places where he has happened to work: One just plugs the 
computer into an outlet and begins to press buttons. At present, 
it is very important for us to have bankers on the team who 
could get a handle on the domestic Russian situation. 
  Banking practitioners could work on it themselves, too. 
Unfortunately, the helping hand that we are holding out is not 
seen from the offices on Neglinnaya Street.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Belyayev, deputy chairman of the </F>
board of Kronbank, by DELOVOY MIR correspondent Marina Talskaya; 
place and date not given: "What the Screen of Privatization Was 
Concealing"] 
  [Text] The end of last year saw a smooth reduction in 
the rate of growth of inflation and a stable exchange rate of 
the ruble against the dollar. This made the January surge of 
prices and the dizzying upswing in the exchange rate of the 
dollar all the more surprising for many. Why did this happen? 
How will events develop in the future? This was the topic of our 
discussion with Mikhail Belyayev, deputy chairman of the board 
of Kronbank. 
  [Talskaya] As specialists from the Ministry of Finance, the 
Central Bank, and the government view it, the fourth quarter of 
last year was marked by general financial stabilization. The 
inflationary flareup that began literally in the initial days of 
the new year prompts us to suspect that talk about the beginning 
of recovery was somewhat premature. Why and how did the illusion 
emerge, which many people came to believe in with relief? 
  [Belyayev] The arguments of those who heralded the beginning 
of financial stabilization rested on four "pillars": reducing 
the budget deficit as much as possible; retaining the dollar at 
a relatively stable level compared to the ruble; allegedly 
reducing the rate of inflation; and having a positive balance of 
trade. 
  Even at that time it was clear to specialists that all of 
this apparent success is merely a screen which conceals the old 
ills of our economy, and that sooner or later they will make 
their presence known again. 
  Let us begin with the first argument, this technical 
parameter that needed to be "run by" the International Monetary 
Fund. Unfortunately, the greatest possible reduction of the 
budget deficit was not accomplished by increasing the 
contractual segment of the budget out of the financial profits 
of enterprises. Hardly anyone can dispute this, because the 
numbers indicating a decline in production testify that the 
slump has already exceeded, in terms of magnitude, the level of 
America's Great Depression. The revenue side of the budget was 
generated with taxes which they kept inventing and making 
harsher. The taxes smothered production completely. Therefore, 
such "recovery" in the budget cannot by any means be called 
healthy. It is just like pouring ice on a sick person and 
registering a reduction in his fever based on purely technical 
attributes. 
  As far as inflation is concerned, the rate of growth of 
which 
fell to 15 percent in November, this happened solely for 
trend-related reasons: At the end of the year economic 
activities usually die down; nobody buys anything in particular 
from anyone, and for this reason prices barely grow. However, 
tell me whether it is possible to turn a one-time phenomenon, 
whereby inflation merely took a slight "dip," into a trend and 
proclaim this the beginning of a turnaround (given that for two 
years the monthly rate of inflation came to 20-25 or even 30 
percent)? January served up an unambiguous answer to this 
question. 
  The exchange rate of the dollar against the ruble was indeed 
quite stable. However, it was visible to the naked eye that the 
exchange rate of the dollar was vigorously depressed. This was 
accomplished through the fourth "pillar." 
  A positive balance of trade was attained, but not at all by 
increasing commercial deliveries of machinery and equipment to 
foreign markets. First, this happened as a result of reducing 
import purchases, and second, due to the peculiar structure of 
exports (precious metals and precious stones accounted for more 
than one-half of them). We might say that even silverware was 
put to use. Even energy sources account for 10-12 percent of our 
exports. The foreign exchange generated in this manner was 
passed around on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange and the 
exchange rate of the dollar against the ruble was reined in. 
  [Talskaya] You mentioned a reduction in import purchases. 
However, wherever you turn we have nothing but imports 
here--both foodstuffs and manufactured goods. 
  [Belyayev] This is not quite it, these are dirt-cheap goods. 
I meant reductions in such items as machinery, equipment, raw 
materials. Instead of one machine tool you can buy a 
steamship-load of pantyhose or a train-load of Snickers, which 
is what is happening now. Besides, exotic imported consumer 
goods are far from abundant in the entire country. 
  Therefore, we may say with certainty that all the machinery 
was at work in order to present numbers in a favorable political 
light in time for the December elections. This propaganda 
technique had nothing to do with real economic analysis. 
  [Talskaya] So, January came.... 
  [Belyayev] Economic laws are as objective as the laws of 
physics, the laws of nature. They may be suppressed for a period 
of time, but the time of artificially manipulating them is far 
from infinite. Such manipulation is permissible and bears fruit 
if the causes of unfavorable influence on the economy are 
eliminated at the same time. However, if this does not happen, 
the compressed spring shoots out all the more forcefully the 
longer and more brutal the pressure applied to it. The magnitude 
of the shot was also influenced by the political events of 
December and the slamming of doors in January. Since 
oversensitivity to all kinds of political flareups has already 
been instilled here, the reverberations from the abrupt release 
of the compressed spring, that is, economic parameters, were 
stronger. 
  This was primarily reflected in inflation, which is logical. 
At the beginning of the year economic activities picked up, and 
all the old ills came to light--the crisis in production, 
nonpayments, political agitation, the soaring exchange rate of 
the dollar. 
  The growth of the exchange rate of the dollar against the 
ruble was also predictable from the outset. We must grasp 
clearly that our currency market is not at all a money market in 
the classical interpretation but a hoarding-and-speculation 
market. It is highly sensitive to political changes and prone to 
panicky attitudes on account of any rumor. This is why at the 
beginning of the year the dollar once again played its peculiar 
Russian role of a vehicle for accumulation and hedging one's 
savings. 
  Factors of a strictly trend-related nature also contributed 
to the growth of the exchange rate. Perceiving that an upward 
move in the exchange rate of the dollar was beginning, many 
banks decided to play for a rise and committed all their spare 
resources to purchasing dollars. In one week of unprecedented 
upswing, the dollar appreciated 15 percent, that is, ensured a 
profit margin for the banks that no banking operation can yield. 
  [Talskaya] If so, why did it subsequently fall? 
  [Belyayev] It could not fail to fall. Panic buying 
catapulted 
it upwards way beyond the natural mark, that is, the genuine 
ratio at which transactions are effected. Besides, the play for 
a rise by banks was no longer that careless, first, because 
their resources are finite and they could not generate demand 
endlessly; second, they began to be afraid of generating demand 
in principle because they fully understood that the triumphant 
climb of the exchange rate of the dollar would end soon and that 
there was the risk of "taking a beating" in sales. 
  A fall in the exchange rate of the dollar was also caused by 
active currency interventions by the Central Bank of Russia, 
which has dumped about $1 billion from gold and currency 
reserves on the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange in order to 
control panic. 
  However, we cannot by any means draw the conclusion that the 
ruble has strengthened since the exchange rate of the dollar has 
fallen. The ruble may only strengthen against stocks of 
merchandise or against inflation if the latter is being reduced 
as a result of actual economic operations rather than due to 
trend-related factors. The ratio of the ruble to the dollar in 
the present-day Russian market is speculative play, nothing 
more. This should be clearly understood. 
  [Talskaya] The sacramental question: What should be done in 
order to really strengthen the ruble? 
  [Belyayev] So far we have only been discussing the monetary 
parameters of the economy. However, it should be understood that 
real money is derived solely from real stocks of merchandise, 
from the process of production. This is the foundation of a 
market economy. 
  Of course, it is better when high-quality goods are produced 
with great effectiveness. However, qualitative characteristics 
of production are a secondary issue. If nothing at all is 
produced, any and all economies or reforms are altogether out of 
the question. Meanwhile, our reformers have so far introduced 
only secondary and tertiary categories and attributes of the 
market, whereas production has been destroyed and perished. 
  [Talskaya] Appeals on the need to normalize production have 
now become a generality. How is this actually to be ensured? 
What should the combination of production and financial policies 
be? 
  [Belyayev] Taxes on production activities should definitely 
be reduced. Even the volume of the budget deficit may be 
sacrificed. This is not all that terrible. The budget deficit 
does make an inflationary impact. However, if production of some 
merchandise begins, its real value will counter the increase in 
the money supply. These factors will balance each other out. 
  Production needs centralized and preferential credit. So 
that 
the credit will not sink into oblivion through incomprehensible 
funds run by officials, we may take advantage of the experience 
of the EEC. When providing financial assistance to developing 
countries, the EEC also ran into the problem of the embezzlement 
of credit at the local level. They brought in commercial banks. 
First, a commercial bank already knows approximately who it can 
provide for and how much; second, it will see that the credit is 
paid back. Besides, it should also keep records on the targeted 
use of credit: As it were, contracts with borrowers envision the 
use of the funds received for specific types of activities. 
  Of course, even the EEC system for the distribution of 
centralized credit does not eliminate the issue of bribes. Is 
this not an issue at present, too? However, in that case there 
will be at least some hope to get the production process off the 
ground. If this process does not get underway, nothing at all 
will. 
  This is all the more so because the process of the movement 
of money--transferring it from one pocket to another from the 
bottom up (as we have had in recent years)--is not endless in 
the absence of the real movement of merchandise, either. At 
present, the redistribution of profits from trading in pantyhose 
and Snickers is nearing completion. There is nothing else to be 
moved from the pockets of 90 percent of the population. Please 
note that a large proportion of citizens no longer buy anything 
except basic foodstuffs as they continue to balance at the 
poverty-line level. Very rich people are buying, but the set of 
goods they need is specific to them. 
  Therefore, even the appearance of the operation of the 
economy produced by the movement of money will soon be 
dispelled. An imitation of reformist actions no longer convinces 
anyone. Since there is nowhere to retreat, we will apparently 
have to engage in real economic activities.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Naumov: "Multiplication or </F>
`Subtraction'?" 
  [Text] On 1 February Sberbank [RF Savings Bank] depositors 
rushed to bank windows to receive compensation for their 
deposits, which have been devalued by inflation. But very many 
of them learned with bitterness and disappointment that the 
increased savings promised by authorities were not yet for them. 
The only compensation there was tears. 
  Let us recall that on 24 December 1993 the RF president 
signed Decree Number 2297, "On One-Time Compensation for 
Depositors of the Russian Federation Savings Bank With Deposits 
as of 1 January 1992." The decree foresees one-time compensation 
in an amount that is triple the sum of savings in the accounts 
of those depositors who had deposits in Sberbank on 1 January 
1992. The decree was to go into effect on 1 February for 
invalids and retired persons. On 1 July 1994 the decree will 
apply to all remaining citizens who had deposits in Sberbank on 
1 January 1992. 
  T. Tyurin, deputy director of the RF Sberbank's 
Administration for Savings and Accounts comments on the 
situation: 
  "In order to receive compensation for deposits (if, of 
course, the individual wishes to withdraw this money instead of 
keeping it in the account), it is necessary to present proof of 
retirement in addition to the bank book. Some depositors 
withdrew their money from accounts after 1 January 1992, but 
they will also receive compensation. These citizens must bring 
their proof of retirement to the financial operations officer. 
Their paperwork will be found in the archive and compensation 
will be calculated and issued. Or, if the citizen wishes, 
compensation will be deposited in his personal account. 
  "Other depositors with accounts up to 1 January of last year 
will also receive due compensation (threefold increase in 
savings), but only after 1 July 1994, as stipulated by the 
presidential decree. 
  "I will add that depositors have the right to compensation 
regardless of the form of their deposit -- including 
fixed-period deposits for children, term deposits, and so forth." 
  Our commentary follows. Early January of 1992, as we recall, 
was marked by a heavy blow to the average Russian citizen -- the 
liberalization of prices. People who had put something into a 
savings account from their modest incomes, whether for a better 
life or for their funerals, suffered most. Basically, they were 
deprived of their savings, which were swept away by inflation 
after price liberalization. 
  Let us recall that after this a Law on Indexing, applying to 
wages as well as citizens' savings deposits, was passed. The 
government "did not notice" it. On 28 March 1993 President B. N. 
Yeltsin issued Decree Number 409, "On Protecting the Savings of 
Citizens." It contained a great deal that was important and 
just, and that was directed at protecting the legal rights of 
suffering citizens. Although many were doubtful about the point 
concerning sources to finance payments to suffering depositors 
(which TRUD wrote about at the time), the fulfillment of the 
decree would have eased the situation of citizens who had become 
victims of inflation. Alas, the government again ignored the 
presidential decree. The proposal that was born then was nipped 
in the bud in the desks of the finance ministry. But the most 
surprising thing of all was that no one was held responsible. We 
got the impression that the decree was some sort of "distraction 
therapy" for the destitute and that from the start it had been 
earmarked for "being eaten alive" by the government. 
  For many people, the new decree also raises other questions. 
We know that as of 1 January 1992 savings totalled 372.3 billion 
rubles. According to the most measured assessments, inflation 
decreased this total by a factor of approximately 100. Now the 
intention is to increase it fourfold for us (keeping in mind the 
amount of the deposit itself). 
  The sources for compensation are unclear. According to the 
decree, 400 billion is to be allocated from the sale of gold 
reserves and gemstones, and another 200 billion -- from Sberbank 
profits. This totals only 600 billion, whereas simple arithmetic 
shows a sum of over a trillion. Where will the rest of the money 
come from? 
  Another question is raised by T. Onishchenko, co-chairman of 
the society to protect the interests of depositors: 
  "The money of depositors, while in turnover, worked to 
create 
Russia's national wealth. Now the official policy of 
privatization completely ignores this fact. Numerous proposals, 
including by the newspaper TRUD, to repay robbed depositors `in 
kind' -- with land and fixed capital -- have not yet been 
acknowledged in any way." 
  It should be said that on the official level this proposal 
has also not yet been rejected. Thus perhaps it is not too late 
to seriously discuss compensation for losses borne by citizens 
who at one time entrusted their government with their 
hard-earned money.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Gurvich: "Prime Minister of Russia </F>
Approaching the Presidency. Chernomyrdin-Yeltsin, Or Look Who 
Just Arrived"] 
  [Text] Carte blanche. And so many hours of conversation 
between President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin about the composition of the new government ended 
with the withdrawal from the game of key "market" figures, Yegor 
Gaydar and Boris Fedorov, and the destruction of the president's 
last stronghold in the government. 
  Since that day one can say that the prime minister quietly 
but openly removed himself from the president's chain of command 
and began to move in his own autonomous orbit which is aimed, 
quite obviously, toward a future presidency. The prime 
minister's new inner circle must clear a starting space for this. 
  And so we know who left. Who came to replace them? 
Individuals who are personally devoted to Chernomyrdin, 
especially trusted figures. Oleg Soskovets. Completely 
"his"--only such a person can be trusted with the distribution 
of quotas for preferential government credit. In other 
words--quotas for the approach to the government by large and 
medium-sized financial and commercial structures. 
  Yuriy Yarov--a fairly good person and a convenient one since 
he holds no position or real power in the government. 
  Yuriy Shafranik--a nominee from the petroleum and gas 
complex 
and thus by virtue of his mentality he has also fallen from the 
common "nest." These people can always reach agreement among 
themselves. 
  But this government will not conquer inflation, instability, 
or the decline of production. With the departure of Gaydar and 
Fedorov, on whom it was possible to place the blame, these 
economic troubles will be linked in the public consciousness to 
the name of Chernomyrdin personally. But the prime minister does 
not want to bear all the responsibility for his failures. Thus 
in the government Aleksandr Shokhin will become minister of 
economics. He is a figure of a somewhat different level from 
that of Gaydar or Fedorov but he is suitable as another 
lightning rod. 
  In this group the appointment of Anatoliy Chubays remains 
something of a mystery--he is the only figure among the top 
individuals of the current cabinet who is formally supported by 
the president. But if we look carefully we will see that he is 
assigned the role of embodying the failure of privatization. 
Quite reliable rumors have already been leaked to the press and 
television: Behind the facade of loud and tasteless advertising 
of innumerable age-old investment funds was concealed financial 
impotence, if not out-and-out swindling. They were incapable of 
paying solid dividends to the investors, and soon their secret 
will be told. The failure of checkbook privatization and the 
collapse of the majority of so-called investment funds will be 
linked to the name of Chubays. This spot will not stain 
Chernomyrdin--again far-sightedly and adroitly he sidestepped 
the president: Chubays was appointed by a personal edict of the 
president "in excess of the established limit of deputy prime 
ministers." Chernomyrdin has nothing to do with this. 
  There are also lesser figures in Chernomyrdin's inner 
circle. 
As though always in the shadows, they nonetheless do important 
work for advancing him toward his goal. Vladimir Kvasov. One of 
the strongest apparatchiks who, possibly, will become the 
driving force the future election campaign. "Temporarily 
assigned" by the prime minister as a deputy to the Federal 
Assembly, Kvasov then, by an edict from the president, will also 
become a minister. Chernomyrdin adroitly placed this figure in 
the field, while successfully working on both flanks--the 
legislative and the apparatus. 
  Gennadiy Petelin is a personally devoted person, the leader 
of the secretariat, and he can do a great deal to bring the 
candidate for the presidential office closer to influential 
industrial and financial groups. 
  Valentin Sergeyev. An unsinkable bureaucrat who came from 
journalism. He is now a cabinet member in Chernomyrdin's 
government. A commander without an army. A minister of 
information without a ministry, but with delicate functions: to 
coordinate the work for creating the image of the future 
president. 
<H5>  A Chernomyrdin Party? </H5>
  On whom besides his inner circle can Chernomyrdin rely in 
such far-reaching plans? On the one hand, on the industrialists 
with whom he is literally "blood brothers." On the other hand 
there is indirect information that the prime minister is also 
supported by other large new financial and commercial 
structures. But with the foresight typical of such significant 
organizations this support, of course, is not given 
unconditionally. It is, as it were, based on the concrete 
situation, depending on where the new government policy leads. 
  But for now Chernomyrdin, playing on the interests of 
national industry and large Russian banking structures (where he 
parts company with his partner--the country's chief banker, 
Viktor Gerashchenko, and this will be discussed below), is 
actively preparing for the battle for the presidency. 
  Judging from certain symptoms, we will soon witness the 
birth 
of a new party--the Chernomyrdin party. It is possible to 
predict with a good deal of certainty that it will consist of 
two different blocs. On the one hand--political structures of 
the regionals being created today by Sergey Shakhray. With them 
the prime minister obviously has a personal agreement on 
positions in the '96 elections. On the other hand there is a 
certain absolutely controllable bloc of industrialists in 
parliament, which is now being organized with the direct 
participation and coordination of Chernomyrdin's staff. 
<H5>  Skokov-Chernomyrdin </H5>
  The poignancy of the situation consists in that most likely 
Chernomyrdin achieved the formation of a large faction of his 
like-thinkers in the party and the overt assistance from 
Shakhray's party with the president's consent, finding some 
convincing arguments for this. But the outcome is obvious: As a 
result of these efforts, fairly strong groups have been created 
which are in political opposition to the current president. 
  It is worth noting that in order to achieve his goal 
Chernomyrdin selects people with a great deal of political 
ambition. Following his logic he is entering into an unambiguous 
political game with Yuriy Skokov. It is difficult to imagine 
that these contacts were not sanctioned by the president. But 
the motives for returning Skokov to the political arena 
presented to the president might very well be one thing (for 
example, the need for tactical concessions), and the real 
intentions for whose sake some time ago Chernomyrdin spoke with 
Skokov for several hours--are quite a different thing. We do not 
know whether they agreed upon the conditions under which the 
parties would coordinate actions in the '96 elections. But a 
step toward interaction between the prime minister and a person 
who is known for his haughty and condescending attitude toward 
the president has already been taken. 
  Let us repeat: All the aforementioned steps are apparently 
being taken with the president's consent. But is he aware of how 
cleverly he is being "led"? Does he notice how quickly the 
opposition to himself is being reinforced? 
  A special role in this sly game belongs to the team of 
Chernomyrdin-Gerashchenko. The country's chief banker was 
advanced to this key post by Chernomyrdin. The prime minister 
has protected him from being ousted several times during the 
past year. This concern is no accident: Both of them protect 
domestic industry, the military complex, and former state banks. 
But they play on differences of opinion in one fundamental 
issue. Gerashchenko, in spite of economic logic and decisions of 
the higher authorities, with inexplicable persistence is doing 
everything possible to bring foreign banks to our country. His 
partner in the game opposes him. Nonetheless it is clear that in 
reality both today and in the future this is a very solid team. 
  Well, in 1996 (or perhaps much sooner?) history will show 
how 
this game of solitaire plays out in the corridors of Russian 
power.

<F P=106> [Article by the press center of the Cabinet of Ministers of </F>
the Republic of Tatarstan: "Tatarstan-Ukraine: Intergovernmental 
Agreement Signed"] 
  [Text] On 15 January a governmental delegation of the 
Republic of Tatarstan headed by Prime Minister M.G. Sabirov 
visited the capital of Ukraine, the city of Kiev. 
  Bilateral negotiations took place in the House of Government 
of Ukraine. M.G. Sabirov, speaking before participants in the 
negotiations, emphasized that friendly relations between peoples 
whose ancestors have from time immemorial populated the banks of 
the Dnieper and the Volga have their roots deep in past 
centuries. The historical chronicles mention the agreement 
between the Volga Bulgars and the Kievan Prince Vladimir. The 
intergovernmental agreement between the two republics concerning 
mutually advantageous cooperation in the areas of trade, 
science, technology, culture, and art will be another 
confirmation of their friendly relations. 
  In response, the acting head of the government of Ukraine, 
Yu.L. Zvyahilskyy, noted that the deep changes occurring in the 
socioeconomic life of the two states and the economic 
difficulties related to the transition to the market make it 
necessary to rethink existing experience in business cooperation 
and imbue it with new content. Relations between our republics 
should be equal and mutually advantageous and be built on 
principles of mutual respect and confidence. 
  As a result of the negotiations an intergovernmental 
agreement was signed for commercial-economic, 
scientific-technical, and cultural cooperation between the 
Republic of Tatarstan and Ukraine, which envisions providing 
favorable economic, financial, and legal conditions for economic 
and other entrepreneurial activity: the creation of joint 
ventures, the expansion and establishment of direct ties between 
enterprises and organizations of the two republics, the opening 
of trade missions and branches of national banks, and the 
development of cooperation in the areas of culture, art, 
science, and education. 
  The Ukrainian side responded positively to the relations 
that 
are being arranged between the Republic of Tatarstan and the 
Republic of Crimea. 
  The heads of the delegations gave specific instructions to 
the leaders of ministries and departments regarding the 
coordination of the list of goods and the volumes of work and 
services for which our republics are experiencing a need and for 
which mutual deliveries should be organized. Chairmen of 
national banks were instructed to earmark a mechanism for mutual 
settlements for the goods and services delivered. 
  The negotiations proceeded in a warm, friendly atmosphere. 
  Participating from the Republic of Tatarstan were: Deputy 
Chairman of the Supreme Soviet A.N. Lozovoy, Deputy Prime 
Minister R.F. Muratov, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations 
Sh.R. Arslanov, and general directors of the associations 
Sviyaga--G.G. Agadzhanov, Orgsintez--N.Kh. Yusupov, 
Nizhnekamskneftekhim--G.Z. Sakhapov, and Tatneft--first general 
deputy director Sh.F. Takhutdinov. From the Ukrainian side, 
Deputy Prime Minister V.I. Landik and leaders of ministries and 
departments. 
  In honor of the delegation from the Republic of Tatarstan 
the 
government of Ukraine held a dinner during which M.G. Sabirov 
and Yu.L. Zvyahilskyy exchanged speeches. 
  That evening the government delegation from Tatarstan headed 
by Prime Minister M.G. Sabirov returned to Kazan.

<F P=106> [Article by Tagir Agliullin: "What Is Going On Behind the </F>
Walls of the Kazan Kremlin?"] 
  [Text] Kazan--It has already become customary for political 
scientists to put the leadership of two republics--Chechnya and 
Tatarstan--on the same footing. Both the recent Russian 
elections and the referendum conducted on 12 December throughout 
the Russian Federation, with the exception of these two 
republics, once again clearly demonstrated the reality of this 
generalization. 
  But a different, no less "sweetheart couple" has emerged in 
Tatarstan itself--a firm bloc of the ruling nomenklatura and 
"opposition" nationalists has arisen. The former oblast party 
committee apparatchiks have found for themselves in the national 
radicals new and, as it seems to them, firm social support. And 
the nationals are making adroit use of the forces and 
connections of the nomenklatura and the Communist Party of 
Tatarstan, hoping subsequently "to strangle them in their 
embrace" or to paint their red foundation green--the color of 
Islam--and the colors of Tatar nationalism. This "red-green" 
national-nomenklatura bloc took shape at the time of the 
discussion and adoption of the separatist constitution and the 
discriminatory Language Act. On 12 December this alliance 
strengthened even more and became an "indestructible bloc of 
party and nonparty people." 
  Despite the fact that less than 24 percent of the electorate 
voted at the elections in the republic, certain conclusions may 
be drawn from their results. Official, but unlawful, calls for a 
boycott of the Russian ballot, the corresponding "set of 
instructions" to bureaucrats on the part of the authorities, the 
daily campaign in the Tatarstan newspapers and on radio and 
television, the refusal to send out notices and an explanation 
of the procedure of the ballot--this is a far from full list of 
its particular features. I would add here the silent transfer of 
the locations of many polling stations, at not one of which were 
there even Russian flags, moreover, and the unchecked tallying 
of the results by working groups. They were formed for some 
reason or other under the auspices of the administration heads 
for the collection of information from the stations and their 
presentation to the district election commissions. 
  The threats of extremists and their blockade of a number of 
stations in Menzelinsk, Bugulm, and Kazan went unpunished. All 
this reduced the percentage turnout, but, what is most 
important, did not strengthen but, however paradoxical it may 
seem, weakened the sovereignty of the republic. After all, the 
fervent supporters of Zhirinovskiy voted for him, all the same. 
And hundreds of thousands of his opponents did not go to the 
polls. So those who are expatiating only on the fault of the 
democrats for the success of the latter are greatly deluded. 
Having stymied the elections, the ruling circles of Tatarstan 
may with every right consider themselves the cofounders of the 
LDPR parliamentary faction. They contributed to the revival of 
the extreme polarization of Russia, from which the components of 
the Federation gain nothing. 
  The inhabitants of the Kazan Kremlin are once again hoping, 
possibly, to make capital out of the showdowns between the 
authorities in Moscow, as they did in 1990-1991 and in 
1992-1993. But this is short-sighted: Zhirinovskiy has a more 
radical program, and under pressure thereof Yeltsin would be 
forced to adopt decisive measures to restore the single legal 
space of the Federation. As can be seen from poll results, it 
was this for which, in fact, many Russians, Russian-speaking 
Tatars, and Jews were hoping in voting for the LDPR. 
  One further outcome of the elections was the clear defeat 
for 
the "Tatarstan Party," the people of this republic, and its 
leaders. After all, all seven seats for Tatarstan in the Federal 
Assembly remain vacant, and there will be no one to pursue and 
defend the interests of its population in the Russian 
Parliament. This is obvious. In the last three years the ruling 
elite has thwarted practically all Russian elections and 
referenda. But you cannot step on one and the same anti-Russian 
rake ad infinitum. On this occasion its error is of an 
unforgivable nature, the leaders of the local Equality and 
Legality bloc believe. Everyone knows that it is Russian money 
that is used to pay the pensions, grants, and allowances, and 
also wages and credit in the military-industrial complex and 
subsidies. 
  Less obvious is the new fissure in interethnic relations 
that 
has formed since the elections. However much the power-invested 
persons assert that the 12 December elections showed the 
people's political wisdom and their maturity, term "civicism" 
the action of many Russians, Tatars, Chuvash, and Ukrainians who 
did not discharge their civic duty, and give assurances 
concerning a "strengthening of interethnic unity," in practice 
everything is just the opposite. The true act of civic courage 
was performed by those who went to the polls in defiance of the 
plain instructions of the administration heads. The same applies 
to the "strengthening" of national unity. 
  The proposition concerning the "strengthening of interethnic 
unity" also may be evaluated with the same reverse precision. 
Let us take the ballot data for the mixed 24th Moskovskiy 
District. It has urban and rural, Russian and Tatar rayons. In a 
group of four small rural Tatar rayons, only 0.6 percent of the 
electorate voted, while 8.2 percent of inhabitants went to the 
polls in the four large multinational rayons. At the same time, 
on the other hand, 27.3 percent of the electorate took part in 
the elections in the predominantly Russian areas of the 
northwest of the republic, in the city of Zelenodolsk and 
Vekhneuslonskiy Rayon particularly, which was more even than in 
polyethnic Kazan. What conclusion follows from this? We are 
talking about a manifest delineation with an ethnic basis. And 
this came as no surprise to the analysts. 
  A highly transparent conclusion, although "blurred" by the 
republic's ruling elite: Any attempt to fence off the republic 
from the Federation will signify a division of society in 
Tatarstan itself. A division with, we repeat, an ethnic basis. 
This playing with the patriotic feelings of the citizens of the 
Russian Federation who live in the republic is very dangerous. 
It is "preparation" for all interethnic conflicts. And the 
conditions for this are being created by the "boycottists" of 
the elections to, as they believe, a "foreign" parliament 
themselves. 
  And, the final point: As the analysts foresaw, what we see 
is 
the success of the bloc of all federalist forces opposed to the 
disintegration of Russia such as Equality and Legality (RiZ) and 
its constituent Concord pacifist multinational movement of 
Tatarstan. It was their candidates who won a relative victory at 
the elections: The leader of the RiZ bloc, Ivan Grachev, former 
deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan, was 
elected to the Duma on the slate of the Yavlinskiy Bloc. 
Although not elected in his 27th Privolzhskiy District ("only" a 
25.3 percent turnout), Valentin Mikhaylov, a RiZ activist, who 
was also formerly a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan, 
amassed over 40 percent of the vote--almost three times as much 
as his closest rival. Over 47 percent of the votes cast were for 
Vladimir Belyayev, leader of Concord--almost twice the number of 
those cast for Yuriy Voronin, his most serious rival. It is 
obvious that while the showdowns of the supporters of "radical" 
reforms and reforms "in the interests of the people" continue in 
Moscow, Kazan is setting a convincing example of the benefit of 
the unity of all reform forces--both centrists and radicals. And 
any incitement of national egotism in the interests of 
sovereignty is having a directly opposite effect.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Lukashov: "A Split Among the Tatar </F>
National-Patriots; `Ittifak' Party Finds Itself With Two 
Leaders"] 
  [Text] A meeting held in Kazan for leaders and 
representatives of the rayon organizations of the "Ittifak" 
party, which stands on extremely radical nationalist positions, 
expressed mistrust of the leader and creator of this party, 
Fauziye Bayramova. 
  The meeting resolution literally stated the following: "The 
meeting participants have a critical attitude toward the 
behavior of `Ittifak' Party Chairman Fauziya Bayramova, who 
herself continually violates the party charter and personally 
and singularly resolves questions of excluding unsuitable 
members from the party ranks, dismissing governing board 
members, etc. Using the deputy mandate of the RT [Republic of 
Tatarstan], she has demanded special attention toward herself 
and special working conditions. Her authoritarian dictate has 
led to the disintegration of the party and to discord in 
inter-ethnic relations in the RT." 
  In order to eliminate unrest, the meeting participants 
adopted the decision "to convene an extraordinary congress of 
the Tatar Party for National Independence [TPNN] `Irrifak' at 
the end of March 1994, to be held in the city of Kazan..., and 
to consider the participants of the said meeting as the 
organizing committee for convening the above-mentioned 
extraordinary session of the TPNN `Ittifak' under the 
chairmanship of F. G. Zaynullina." 
  We must note that this measure was a logical continuation of 
the conflict between Fauziya Bayramova and her former deputy 
within the party, Flera Zaynullina. By Ms. Zaynullina's 
admission, the conflict stems from personal interrelations: 
"Bayramova always saw in me a political rival. But I do not need 
anything--just happiness for my people..." 
  However, according to the unanimous opinion of local 
observers, the real outcome of this conflict may only be the 
split of "Ittifak" into two parties. Parties which differ (like 
many others) not in their views, but in the names of their 
leaders. We might add that in Tatarstan, according to 
approximate accounts, there are more than 20 registered and 
unregistered, small and very small parties and societies of 
nationalistic persuasion. The conflict between the radical and 
moderate wings of the All-Tatar Community Center (VTOTs)--the 
largest political organization in Tatarstan which has given rise 
to almost all the parties of nationalist persuasion--has also 
not been resolved. 
  And while before we could speak of a national movement, 
today 
the split among the Tatar national-patriots is becoming ever 
more apparent.

<F P=106> [Article by the Center for Social Problems of the Republic </F>
of Tatarstan: "How We Lived Through the Year. What Awaits Us 
Ahead"] 
  [Text] According to information from the All-Russian Center 
for the Standard of Living (VTsUZh) under the Ministry of Labor 
of the Russian Federation, the proportion of the population in 
Russia living below the poverty line was 32 percent in July 1993 
and had more than doubled as compared to the same period of 1992. 
  Here the lower limit of poverty was taken as the budget of 
the subsistence minimum or, as we usually say, "subsistence 
minimum." According to data of the VTsUZh, its level in monetary 
terms varies depending on regional peculiarities. Thus it is 
highest in the Far East, in the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, 
and in Amur Oblast, and it is lower than others in the Central 
Chernozem regions of Russia, Rostov Oblast, and the Republic of 
Tatarstan. In December the value figure of the subsistence 
minimum for Tatarstan amounted to 24,000 rubles [R], while the 
average for Russia was R44,350. 
  In order to evaluate the standard of living we now use the 
concept of subsistence minimum and not minimum consumer budget. 
Although society cannot for very long allow itself to be 
oriented toward the subsistence minimum (lower limit of 
poverty), which makes it possible to make ends meet only with 
difficulty. This is why it is necessary to prepare for a shift 
to indicators of the minimum consumer budget, which is 
considerably higher than the subsistence minimum and is 
essentially the upper limit of poverty. 
  Recently the appearance of new sources of income for the 
population has led to rapid changes in the social structure of 
society and further separation in terms of income levels. Last 
year the average per capita income of the most well-off 10 
percent of the population increased at the most rapid rates. In 
September 1993 they increased 15-fold as compared to September 
1992 (for the least well-off--12-fold). The difference between 
the per capita incomes of the wealthiest 10 percent and the 
poorest 10 percent of the population was 10.2-fold as compared 
to 8.2-fold in September of the preceding year. The wealthiest 
20 percent of the population accounts for 43 percent of all the 
monetary incomes, and the 20 percent of the population with the 
lowest incomes--7 percent. In 1991 these figures were 36 and 9.4 
percent, respectively. The ratios for Tatarstan are 
approximately the same as for the Russian Federation in 1992. 
This is if the subsistence minimum is used for evaluation. But 
if one takes the amount of the minimum consumer budget, the 
picture shows even sharper contrasts. This is why our republic's 
government devotes so much attention to questions of social 
protection when conducting the economic reforms. Moreover, while 
at the beginning of the year, in keeping with the Program for 
Targeted Social Protection, assistance from the state was 
received by practically all of the republic's population, today 
it is received specifically by the underprivileged. 
  In April 1993 a permanent republic commission for 
implementing the Program for Targeted Social Protection was 
formed under the Government of Tatarstan. This resulted in the 
creation of a comprehensive system that makes it possible to 
improve methods of state regulation of the economy during the 
process of conducting the reforms. On the commission's 
initiative, laws were adopted on the minimum wage and the 
subsistence minimum and went into force effective 1 January 
1994. This means that the minimum wage cannot be below the 
subsistence minimum. Changes were made in the Program for 
Targeted Social Protection that keep the standard of living of 
underprivileged groups of the population from dropping. 
  We all understand that the state can render assistance to 
the 
underprivileged and unfortunate and guarantee a minimum wage at 
the level of the subsistence minimum only if the economy is 
functioning normally and the budget is being augmented. 
Unfortunately, 1994, like last year, is beginning with a decline 
in production, profit, and investments...and nonetheless, 
according to predictions of analysts of the Center for Social 
Problems, in 1994 the rates of the economic decline should slow 
up. The volumes of industrial production will decrease, but not 
as severely as last year (5-6 percent as against 18 percent). 
The volume of investments will probably remain at the current 
level. In today's economic and political conditions it is 
difficult to imagine large-scale reconstruction of the economy 
or large structural changes. We found this out for ourselves 
from the example of YelAZ and the KamAZ Engine Plant. Obviously, 
this year the main "players" in the structural rearrangement 
will be the enterprises themselves. Let us hope that they will 
begin more actively to change the profile of production for 
their own development and economic growth. One can assume that, 
having learned from bitter experience in overstocking finished 
products, the producer enterprises will be oriented toward 
satisfying the effective demand. Then productions that cannot 
compete will be shut down and capital investments from 
ineffective productions will shift to effective ones and, 
naturally, there will be a stronger tendency toward the 
formation of prices that precisely reflect expenditures and 
conditions of demand. 
  And this, in turn, will exert an influence on inflation as 
well. For, according to preliminary data, in 1993 inflation 
amounted to about 1,000 percent and prices grew on average 
10-fold (in 1992--30-fold). And if a strict finance-credit 
policy is observed and relations between the federal and 
republic budgets are clearly defined, in 1994 we can count on an 
easing of inflation. Then it will be possible to predict also a 
stabilization of the standard of living of most of the 
republic's population. At the same time there will be a sharp 
increase in expenditures by the population on municipal services 
and transportation costs. It is known that these branches are 
surviving on state subsidies here. But it is also known that if 
the producer is subsidized, the branch is subject to stagnation. 
In other words, if society has a social need for certain goods 
or services and their production is costly or too expensive for 
the consumers, it is not the producer who should be subsidized 
but the specific consumer himself. And conditions must be 
created for the branches whereby the operation of their 
enterprises is profitable. All these issues must be resolved 
during the forthcoming year. 
  A great deal, of course, will depend on the course of the 
economic reforms in the republic. But the solutions to certain 
problems are obviously being dragged out. Thus while small-scale 
privatization has almost been completed in the Russian 
Federation, in our republic only 2 percent of the enterprises in 
retail trade have been turned over to private hands, and the 
volume of commodity turnover in retail trade was 5.6 percent 
during the 10 months as compared to 32.6 percent in the Russian 
Federation. 
  Now about unemployment. In 1993 it held at the level of 0.2 
percent (as against 1 percent on average for the Russian 
Federation). According to the economic theory of the market 
economy it is necessary to choose: either high inflation or a 
further decline in the economy but a small percentage of 
unemployment (as now), or suppression of inflation and 
strengthening of the ruble but inevitable bankruptcy of 
enterprises and growth of unemployment. The inevitability of 
these alternatives is confirmed by world practice, but the ratio 
between them can be regulated. If we awaken a spirit of 
entrepreneurship and resourcefulness that lies dormant in each 
person, if we create conditions that support entrepreneurship 
(the system of taxation, credit policy, and the code of laws on 
entrepreneurship), this will also entail the creation of new 
jobs and, hence, both a reduction of unemployment and an 
increase in production volumes. 
  And so during the year that has begun there are 
preconditions 
in the republic's economy for overcoming the crisis phenomena 
caused by the transition to the market. In certain branches 
stabilization and even an insignificant growth of production 
have occurred. Therefore it is possible to count on 1994 being a 
year of hope and real positive changes.

<F P=106> [Interview with R. Khabibrakhmanov, chief of a subdepartment </F>
of the State Land Committee of the Republic of Tatarstan, 
conducted by Tatyana Korneyeva: "In Order To Turn the Land Over 
to the Peasants in the Rayons"; date and place of interview not 
given] 
  [Text] About three years have passed since the 
beginning of the proclamation of land reform in Tatarstan. At a 
recent conference in the State Land Committee, some interesting 
figures were cited. In 1993 alone, 34,317 orchard plots were 
granted to the republic's population. Now there are more than 
445,000 of them with a total area of 26,000 hectares. More than 
3,700 parcels of land were allocated for individual housing 
construction in cities and settlements. The number of personal 
auxiliary farms increased by 5,200. However, land reform has not 
proceeded smoothly everywhere and in every respect. 
  R. Khabibrakhmanov, chief of a subdepartment of the 
State Land Committee of the Republic of Tatarstan, comments on 
the current situation. 
  [Korneyeva] Rauf Khabibrakhmanovich, although the figures 
look impressive, they say little to the uninitiated. What can 
you say about the pace of land reform in the republic? 
  [Khabibrakhmanov] The process of the democratization of land 
relations and creation of a mixed economy is proceeding much 
more slowly in Tatarstan than in Russia. One of the key aspects 
of land reform is the organization of peasant and individual 
farms. There are 712 of them in the republic with a total area 
of more than 24,000 hectares. But that is only 0.7 percent of 
total agricultural land. If one says that 57 farms ceased to 
exist last year, the overall picture is a dreary one. In two 
cases the individual farmers themselves couldn't make it and 
gave up. In the remaining cases land was confiscated because of 
various violations of land-use regulations. 
  The greatest number of peasant farms was organized last year 
in Aznakayevskiy, Almetyevskiy, Bavlinskiy, Bugulminskiy and 
Spasskiy rayons. And yet no one was found in Atninskiy, 
Kaybitskiy and Cheremshanskiy rayons who wanted to establish 
individual farms, and there are very few farms in 
Tyulyachinskiy, Drozhzhanovskiy, Muslyumovskiy and Apastovskiy 
rayons. 
  [Korneyeva] What are the reasons for that situation? 
  [Khabibrakhmanov] First of all, there is the effect of 
objective circumstances. Despite broad-scale propaganda for 
individual farming arrangements, rural residents continue to 
prefer collective labor on kolkhozes and sovkhozes. Despite all 
their drawbacks, social and economic questions are resolved much 
more easily on them. And there is hardly any need to speak yet 
again about the numerous difficulties involved in creating a 
sound and dependable basis of physical facilities and equipment 
for peasant farms. They are well known. 
  Those are the main but, alas, not the only reasons that have 
held up the development of the individual-farming movement. Many 
economic executives and local administrations have shown a 
negative attitude toward the development of new production 
relations in the countryside and have artificially created 
various obstacles. Just let a city dweller try to obtain a 
parcel of land in a rural locality to use for personal auxiliary 
farming! In rare cases will he meet with understanding and 
support on the part of local authorities. The picture is more 
likely to be the opposite: The kolkhozes and sovkhozes, which 
are still monopolistic land owners, do not part so readily with 
their property. The flood of complaints from citizens is rising. 
A great deal could be done here by the local authorities, who 
have been granted broad powers to dispose of parcels of land. 
However, the soviets have been acting extremely timidly to 
defend citizens' legitimate rights and interests. 
  [Korneyeva] But perhaps the economic executives and local 
administrations are right in not rushing to hand out land right 
and left. After all, you mentioned those who have voluntarily 
given up parcels of land they have taken, and those from whom it 
has even been necessary to take back land parcels. 
  [Khabibrakhmanov] Unfortunately, there have been a good many 
violations of land laws. Last year our service identified more 
than a thousand such cases, and administrative penalties were 
imposed on many violators; the total amount of the fines came to 
3,700,000 rubles. Typical violations involve the unauthorized 
construction of facilities by enterprises and organizations 
without the necessary official permission to withdraw parcels of 
land for such purposes. Quite often production wastes are dumped 
on land and fertile soil is polluted. In Baltasinskiy Rayon, 
subdivisions of Kazankhimstroy [approximate expansion: Kazan 
Trust? for the Construction of Chemical-Industry Facilities] and 
Selkhozkhimiya [approximate expansion: Agricultural Chemistry 
Association] have been building their own production facilities 
without authorization, and a hospital and production facilities 
for the gas depot are also being built without authorization. In 
Atninskiy Rayon, the rayon DRSU [Regional Directorate of Road 
Repair and Construction], the veterinary station and the gas 
service are among those engaged in unauthorized construction. 
  There have been a good many cases in which land has been 
used 
ineffectively by peasant farms and the auxiliary farms of 
industrial enterprises. We analyze matters and attempt to take 
action. The ways to improve soil fertility and crop yields and 
to make effective use of land on such farms have been discussed 
in Almetyevskiy, Rybno-Slobodskiy, Sabinskiy, Verkhneuslonskiy, 
Mamadyshskiy and other rayons. 
  The oil drillers, the Bugulminskiy Highway Administration, 
the "Kamgesenergostroy," the Yelabuga Motor Vehicle Plant, the 
Yelabuga Brick Plant and other enterprises simply cannot or do 
not want to restore disturbed land to fit condition. 
  It is important to provide a mechanism in the near future 
for 
effective state control over the conservation and effective use 
of land. This is very important at the stage of the development 
of private land ownership and of various forms of economic 
operation. Unfortunately, it has proved extremely difficult to 
eliminate even the violations that have been identified: we 
still lack legislative acts on administrative penalties for the 
violation of land legislation. And so far the measures taken 
against violators are simply not serious. Fines are meager. 
  [Korneyeva] Rauf Khabibrakhmanovich, but it seems that there 
are no permanent documents codifying citizens' right to land. Is 
that the case? 
  [Khabibrakhmanov] That is not quite the case. Legal 
codification of the forms of land possession and use does exist. 
In the past two years more than 750,000 land owners and land 
users have received appropriate permits--granting the right to 
land ownership and to the use of land without a time limit 
(permanent use). But these really are temporary permits. Our 
committee has prepared the forms for state documents granting 
the right of land possession and use. They will be issued in 
place of the temporary permits. In this connection, according to 
a recent decree of the government of the Republic of Tatarstan, 
the reregistration of land previously granted for all categories 
of land use has now begun. 
  [Korneyeva] Aren't the norms for the size of parcels 
allocated being changed in this connection? 
  [Khabibrakhmanov] According to existing legislation, the 
size 
of parcels turned over at no charge only for ownership by 
citizens is strictly limited. I may recall that for an orchard 
plot it is 0.1 hectares of land, for housing construction in a 
suburban zone--up to 0.15 hectares, for personal auxiliary 
farming by city dwellers in a rural location--up to 0.2 
hectares, and for rural residents--up to 1 hectare. 
  Norms also exist for the amount of land turned over for 
private ownership for peasant farms. They are different in 
different rayons and are approved by the local soviets.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vener Salimov, chairman of the Committee for </F>
State Security of the Republic of Tatarstan, by Raisa 
Shcherbakova; place and date not given: "The Time of Vagueness 
Has Passed"] 
  [Text] We had not managed to get used to the renaming 
of the KGB as the MB (Ministry of Security) before there was a 
new sign change--the president of Russia signed a new edict and 
"Statute on the Federal Counterintelligence Service of the 
Russian Federation." The new abbreviation for this stern 
department now goes like this--FSK. 
  Our correspondent met with the chairman of the 
Committee for State Security of the Republic of Tatarstan, V. 
Salimov. 
  [Shcherbakova] Vener Asylgareyevich, was anybody left 
without 
a job after your department was reorganized? 
  [Salimov] As far as I know there are about five people on 
the 
staff of the FSK today. And all the rest of us are outside the 
staffs. 
  [Shcherbakova] Excuse me, but where do you personally stand 
now? Have you been fired too? 
  [Salimov] No, we have not been fired. We are working as hard 
as ever. But we are all waiting for the time of our appointment 
to the appropriate positions. I personally have to present my 
vision of the structure of the future organ--my rights are 
restricted here. Republic leaders have the right, taking into 
account the situation that has developed, to make their own 
proposals regarding the formation of the structure, which by no 
means has to copy the central apparatus. Future workers will be 
appointed by the future manager of the new organ, and as for the 
manager himself...everything is in the hands of the Supreme 
Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan. According to our 
Constitution, it determines the list of ministries, departments, 
and committees. It also has to decide whether or not our 
structure will remain a part of the Cabinet of Ministers and 
what it will be called. Possibly the territorial 
counterintelligence service. I will not have any objections. As 
they say, call us whatever you will...the important thing is the 
essence of our activity. 
  I personally do not like the fact that our department's 
tasks 
have eroded over the past three years. Some people, including 
people's deputies, have had a great desire to direct the efforts 
of state security organs almost to carrying out militia tasks. 
  [Shcherbakova] But you have also had programs in common.... 
  [Salimov] And we still have them. But we take from them for 
action those issues that must be decided by Chekists and 
counterintelligence workers. With the appearance of the new 
statute, everything was put back into place and now our workers 
can breathe easy--they will finally be doing what they were 
taught to do. 
  [Shcherbakova] Unfortunately, the statute itself is 
classified. 
  [Salimov] And I do not dare to quote our main tasks from it. 
They include disclosure, prevention, and interception of 
subversive intelligence activity on the part of foreign special 
services and organizations against the Russian Federation. They 
include fighting terrorism, corruption, contraband operations, 
illegal trade in arms and narcotics, illegal armed formations, 
and also illegally created or banned social associations that 
encroach on the constitutional structure of the Russian 
Federation. They also include providing, within the limits of 
our authority, for the protection of the country's state 
secrets. And so forth. 
  In brief, during the process of reorganization subdivisions 
are formed that will engage exclusively in professional 
activity--based on the tasks I mentioned to you. Fortunately, we 
have something to defend. 
  [Shcherbakova] Yes, just take the military-industrial 
complex. It seems that the top departments have not yet been 
eliminated anywhere. 
  [Salimov] Quite right. 
  [Shcherbakova] But the times of sabotage and terrorist acts 
when enemies appeared everywhere seem to have passed.... 
  [Salimov] But take the war in the Caucasus and reports about 
important communications being out of commission. I personally 
do not participate in the investigation of the events going on 
there, they are independent states, but according to the 
estimates of our specialists, all the signs of subversive acts 
are there. 
  In our offices we analyze and predict the development of 
situations and take preventive measures not to allow such 
actions to occur here. Do not forget that we have vital 
facilities that are of immense importance! And if the water that 
comes into the sinks from immense reservoirs is poisoned or if 
during a 40-degree freeze the city ends up without electricity 
or heat, it makes no difference to the rank-and-file citizen who 
is responsible for the action--whether it was an assignment of a 
foreign special service or by the will of a sick person, a 
schizophrenic. And we must also predict the social explosions 
that could create a threat to the population. 
  [Shcherbakova] So when it comes to predictions, are you an 
unofficial adviser to our president? 
  [Salimov] No, he has plenty of advisers. But, naturally, I 
report my conclusions periodically. And if they are worthy of 
attention, the appropriate decisions, as a rule, are made. A 
recent example: An edict was adopted declaring it illegal to 
create militarized formations on the territory of the republic. 
It was partly on our initiative that this edict appeared. 
  [Shcherbakova] How do you feel about the demands to place 
your department under the jurisdiction of Tatarstan? 
  [Salimov] Today the KGB of the Republic of Tatarstan is 
wholly and completely guided by the norms of the law of the 
Russian Federation. Today we are no longer a law enforcement 
organ, we are purely a special service, counterintelligence. 
Training specialists for our service is a very costly matter. If 
they were to make an ill-considered decision to transfer us to 
the jurisdiction of Tatarstan, this service would be doomed to 
complete inaction. And then, since we are physically located in 
the center of Russia, whom would we work against? 
  [Shcherbakova] Do you think that the shakeup of your 
department has finally ended and that you will now engage 
exclusively in counterintelligence work? 
  [Salimov] We would like to hope that. The activity of the 
FSK 
is by no means directed toward encroachment on the legal rights 
of citizens as envisioned by the Constitution. At the same time, 
it will make it possible to solve basic problems more 
efficiently and on a higher professional level. Note that last 
year alone several dozen citizens were exposed (including state 
bureaucrats--editor's note) who had been recruited by foreign 
special services. This shows that subversive counterintelligence 
activity has become much more active. The conditions for this 
are more favorable than ever before. Many components of the 
Russian Federation have been given the right to conduct foreign 
economic activity independently. Leaders of joint-stock 
companies and retail firms have direct connections with foreign 
partners. But they have no experience! The corresponding 
legislative base is not in place either. Until recently we did 
not even have laws on state secrets or state borders. 
  [Shcherbakova] But let us say that there were new elections 
of parliament and the president, would the situation change.... 
  [Salimov] Let us not guess about the distant future. And 
anyway in the near future, in keeping with the new statute on 
the Federal Counterintelligence Service...we will be able to 
organize our own work. Workers of our department are quite 
satisfied: The time of vagueness and the time of doubts has 
passed. The tasks have been earmarked. Let us work.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Polevanov, by correspondent Nikolay </F>
Belyy; place and date not given: "On the High Banks of the Amur"] 
  [Text] Blagoveshchensk--Another change of leadership 
took place at the end of last year in Amur Oblast. The previous 
head of the administration, having fallen victim to political 
intrigues, was dismissed by the president for having clearly 
counterposed himself to the well-known Edict 1400. Vladimir 
Polevanov, a 44-year-old doctor of sciences, become governor. 
What are the concerns of the distant region at this difficult 
time and how is it surviving today, and has the president's 
choice given a good account of himself? The new governor of Amur 
Oblast answers ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's questions. 
  [Belyy] The Amur region is a land far away from centers, 
which is, possibly, no bad thing. Formerly, when the first 
Cossacks came to the Amur, they linked their successful life 
with distance from the authorities. Or have things changed in 
our day? 
  [Polevanov] Our forefathers were right in their own way. It 
is important that the reckless voluntarism of the center has 
not, as in the past, prevented the regions themselves from 
devising the strategy and tactics of their own development or 
resolving the problems of the organization of their own life 
themselves, without soliciting everything from Moscow. While 
recognizing at the same time that a region, however far from the 
capital it may be, is an integral law-abiding part of the 
Federation, with all the ensuing obligations. 
  We are currently preparing to elect a new representative 
authority. Following consultations with various parties and 
movements, the corresponding documents have been drawn up, and 
elections will be held in the oblast on 27 March. Nominating and 
forming on the basis of the people's free expression an oblast 
parliament which does not, like the previous one, throw wrenches 
in the works of the executive is an urgent task. 
  [Belyy] And you think it will be possible to elect such an 
oblast parliament? Amur Oblast is quite conservative.... 
  [Polevanov] I hope so, at least. We have adopted the 
provision that only a person who resides in a district may run 
for election from it. This will spare the electorate the "decoy 
ducks" and "Varangians" popular in the era of the omnipotence of 
the CPSU. 
  [Belyy] How does the governor intend to determine the 
priorities of the region's development? 
  [Polevanov] In the past 100 days of my governorship, I have 
seen for myself that there are no trifling issues and that 
everything is important for people. Reforms will occur in any 
case; we need only create the conditions for the normal 
functioning of market relations. Amur Oblast is among the 
regions of Russia where crime has fallen. A wide-ranging and, in 
my view, very necessary operation code-named Barrier began as of 
the start of this year. Ours is a border oblast, and a procedure 
of the registration of foreigners is vitally necessary, for we 
run the risk of losing control of the situation, as happened in 
Vladivostok. 
  We hope to complete the construction of the Blagoveshchensk 
Thermal Electric Power Station and get the installation of the 
Bureyskaya Hydroelectric Station, the biggest in the Far East, 
going. Owing to inadequate financing, this construction project 
has for many years been eking out a miserable existence. In the 
future this will be a powerful source of energy, and, once 
again, not only for us. 
  We will continue to fight for our regional rights guaranteed 
by the new Constitution of Russia, but the mechanisms and 
legislative instruments pertaining to these rights have still to 
be completed. We need, finally, to have eliminated a whole 
number of disproportions. The most obvious and glaring of these 
is the fact that in the past year the customs charge for the 
transshipment of freight through our customs houses on the 
Russian-Chinese border amounted to R17 billion, of which the 
oblast came in for an utterly risible 3 percent--R350 million.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Nikolay Bulavintsev: "Elections in </F>
the Regions: `Federation Council' on a Local Scale"] 
  [Text] Penza--Right after Tula Oblast, another--Penza 
Oblast--has elected its legislative assembly. One hundred and 
eighty-six persons contended for 45 deputy seats in 37 electoral 
districts. But one peculiarity immediately struck the eye as 
soon as the newly fledged candidates for deputy were registered: 
The managers of the executive branch or their deputies decided 
to run for the local duma in all the rayons and the oblast 
center. 
  However, in a professional sense, the list of candidates 
looked rather uniform. Immediately after the managers of the 
executive branch there were doctors, plant directors, and 
teachers on the list. But there were practically no workers. And 
on the eve of the elections it was possible without any risk to 
assume that in the election results the majority of the seats in 
the representative organ of Penza Oblast would belong to 
managers of the executive branch. 
  These elections had one more peculiarity. Of the seven 
doctors who ran for a seat in the oblast duma, all were elected. 
This "100 percent coincidence" is explained by the fact that 
people no longer associate their hopes with any kind of specific 
political party, but they are seeking faith and support in those 
who can help them specifically in the resolution of vitally 
important questions. 
  That people cannot be swayed by loud phrases or conniving 
slogans is also indicated by the fact that only 43 percent of 
the total number of voters took part in the elections to the 
legislative assembly of Penza Oblast, and little more than 30 
percent in the oblast center. Many Penza residents gave a simple 
and clear reason for refusing to vote: "We are fed up! We are 
voting for the fourth time in a year, but life is not changing 
for the better..." 
  The deputies of the oblast duma should think seriously about 
these words and figures.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Changes in the Oblast Administration"] </F>
  [Text] In connection with the creation of new 
sociopolitical circumstances in Chelyabinsk Oblast, analyzing 
the two-year experience of the administration's work under the 
conditions of emerging market-type relations, and taking into 
account the need to reform the structure of the executive branch 
in this oblast for the purpose of making further progress along 
the path of economic changes, the oblast administrative 
head--V.P. Solovyev--adopted a decree on changes in the 
structure and leadership of this oblast's administration. The 
decision of the Oblast Council of People's Deputies "On the 
Scheme for Governing the Oblast and the Structure of the Oblast 
Administration's Organs," dated 12 November 1992," was reversed. 
  The decree adopted on 24 January 1994 abolished the 
positions 
of all the oblast administration's deputy heads, including that 
of the first chairman of the coordinating council and the 
administrator of affairs. 
  In order to head up and coordinate the activities of the 
oblast administration's structural subdivisions under the new 
conditions, the above-mentioned decree introduced seven deputies 
instead of the previous nine ones. The following persons were 
appointed deputy heads of the oblast administration: for affairs 
of industrial policy and infrastructure development--V.B. 
Bukrin, for affairs of budgetary policy--A.Ye. Prokin, for links 
with the public, mass media, and the development of education 
and culture--B.A. Mizrakhi, for affairs of economic, 
privatization, and investment policy--V.B. Khristenko, for 
affairs pertaining to the development of market-type relations 
in the field of public services, foreign-economic activity, as 
well as the fight against crime and corruption--N.R. Sudenkov, 
for affairs involving agrarian policy and the development of 
market-type relations in agriculture--Zh.K. Altynbayev, and for 
affairs involving social policy, public health care, as well as 
eliminating the consequences of natural disasters and 
rehabilitation--V.A. Yachmenev. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  L.A. Ivanova submitted her resignation from the post of 
deputy head of the Chelyabinsk Administration. She gave as the 
reason for her departure the fact that--as an official--she bore 
responsibility for the absence of monitoring controls on the 
spending of budgetary funds in the committee on medicine. As our 
readers probably know already, the office of the municipal 
procurator has uncovered instances of large-scale 
misappropriations or even thefts in this structural subdivision. 
There is an ongoing investigation into this matter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Boris Nikolayevich Mityurev, press </F>
secretaryof the oblast administrative head, by A. Shcherbakov: 
"What Caused the Changes in the Oblast Administration?: Some 
Details"] 
  [Text] The changes in the oblast administration have not 
passed unnoticed by the readers of this newspaper. They are 
interested in what caused these changes and why the names of 
A.D. Belishko and L.I. Ratnikova are not on the list of the 
administration's deputy heads. We asked B.N. Mityurev, press 
secretary of the oblast administrative head, for an explanation 
of these matters. 
  [Mityurev] The preamble of the decree involved here 
unambiguously emphasizes the motives for reforming the structure 
of the executive branch. These comprise the new sociopolitical 
circumstances which have now evolved in our oblast, as well as 
an analysis of the two years of work done by the administration 
under the conditions of emerging market-type relations. The need 
to make further progress along the path of economic changes also 
impelled Vadim Solovyev to adopt this decree. 
  We can hardly recognize it as a normal situation when the 
apparatus of an oblast administration contains 11 deputies, 
including three first deputies. At present seven deputies 
remain, and their powers of office have been greatly expanded. 
  The following three names are no longer on the list of 
deputies: A.D. Belishko, L.I. Ratnikova, and V.V. Gorodnichiy, 
the administrator of affairs. Their positions have been 
abolished. But that does not mean that these persons have been 
dismissed from work. A.D. Belishko was offered the post of 
heading up our delegation in the association of republics and 
oblasts in the Ural Region with the retention of his salary and 
transportation expenses. 
  L.I. Ratnikova was offered the post of heading up the 
committee on science. This is the kind of work that she knows 
very well. A no less important post within the new structures 
was likewise offered to V.V. Gorodnichiy. 
  To be sure, Andrey Dmitriyevich Belishko refused to accept 
the new appointment indicated above. 
  [Shcherbakov] Boris Nikolayevich, was not his failure to be 
appointed a deputy head caused by some kinds of personal 
relations with the administrative head, or some kinds of 
business-type qualities? 
  [Mityurev] Unfortunately, it must be stated that this was 
noticeable recently; some kind of tension and alienation could 
be observed in the relations between V.P. Solovyev and A.D. 
Belishko. Frankly speaking, I do not know what lay behind this. 
But it came to the surface in various obvious ways and details 
of behavior. 
  [Shcherbakov] Was not the administrative head's decision 
with 
regard to L.I. Ratnikova influenced by the criminal events 
within the Committee on Medicine under the Chelyabinsk City 
Administration? The office of the city procurator uncovered 
instances of large-scale misappropriations and even thefts in 
this structural sibdivision. And, of course, Lyudmila Ivanovna 
Ratnikova was--as we know--in charge of this oblast's medical 
establishment. What is your opinion on this matter? 
  [Mityuyev] I think that this could have influenced V.P. 
Solovyev's decision. But--in principle--he did not state any 
lack of confidence in her, and he offered an important post to 
her. In the final analysis, my opinion is as follows: An 
administrative head has the right to improve the administrative 
structure, as well as the right to decide with whom he is to 
work. 
  [Shcherbakov] Boris Nikolayevich, as far as I understand it, 
the new structure does not contain the position of first deputy 
head at all. But what if the head goes on leave or on a business 
trip--to whom would the reins of government be handed over? 
  [Mityurev] To be sure, the position of first deputy is not 
provided for in the new structure. When and if Vadim Solovyev 
goes on leave, he can leave any of his deputies "in charge." 
That is the way it has been in practice. And I fail to see any 
problem in that regard. 
  I want to emphasize the following point again as 
specifically 
as possible: There was nothing overly hasty in Vadim Solovyev's 
decision to abolish the post of first deputy. This decision was 
adopted based on an analysis of the entire system of mutual 
relations which had evolved over the last two and a half plus 
years. 
  [Shcherbakov] How will this reorganization affect 
committees, 
sections, and administrations? 
  [Mityurev] Reorganization of the apparatus has been going on 
for a long time. The staff was recently cut by one-third. This 
is a normal process, brought about by life itself. And we need 
not see in this some sorts of problems. The reorganization and 
efficiency improvement of the administrative apparatus will 
continue.

<F P=106> [Article by Eduard Urazayev: "Russians Are Leaving the </F>
Republic; Frequently Under Threats of Armed Force"] 
  [Text] Now that the Russian population of the former union 
republics is experiencing so many problems, the problems of the 
Russians in the republics making up the Russian Federation are 
escaping the notice of central councils. The situation in 
Dagestan, however, has reached a critical point. This is 
attested to by the nature of the discussion of 18 January in the 
Republic of Dagestan Council of Ministers and by the resolutions 
that were passed there. The discussion topic was listed on the 
agenda as "Unregulated Migration Processes in the Republic of 
Dagestan." Chief Ilyasov of the personnel administration, who 
also heads a special commission on migration, reported that the 
number of Russians leaving the republic is increasing and said 
that around 4,000 Russians had moved permanently out of Dagestan 
in 1993. According to the 1989 census there were around 166,000 
Russians in the Republic of Dagestan (approximately 9.2 percent 
of the republic population of 1.8 million, but in the middle of 
1993 the figure was just over 7 percent). 
  In recent years the process has acquired the characteristics 
of a virtual avalanche. As Ilyasov reported, a sociological 
survey indicated that the main reasons for Russian emigration 
were the socioeconomic instability, the rising crime rate, and 
the inter-ethnic friction. The speaker also mentioned other 
reasons: unemployment (4.9 percent at the end of 1993 in 
comparison with the republic average of 0.9 percent) and the 
failure of wages to keep up with the minimum subsistence level. 
According to Ilyasov, however, the main reason is the exertion 
of unlawful pressure on the Russian population. Representatives 
of law enforcement agencies reported that three criminal groups 
in Makhachkala had divided up the city's neighborhoods and were 
engaging in explicit acts of terrorism. 
  There are reports of 102 families that were given 10 days to 
leave Makhachkala. Their documents were taken away from them, 
and the property owners among them were forced at gunpoint to 
sign sale authorizations. The republic Ministry of Internal 
Affairs received 21 official complaints, but 40 incidents were 
actually recorded. Twenty of these reports were substantiated, 
but only one case was turned over to the courts. Chairman 
Ramazanov of the Standing Commission on Interethnic Relations of 
the republic Supreme Council said that the roots of the problem 
include the erroneous policy of resettling highlanders in the 
flatlands, which began back in the 1950s. 
  In a final settlement, Chairman Mirzabekov of the republic 
Council of Ministers reminded the gathering that the existence 
of the "Russian problem" had been acknowledged by the republic 
leadership, and this means that all government agencies should 
be taking measures to deter Russian emigration. He said he had 
set up a coordinating council for the Kizlyar zone, that the 
possibility of special status for the zone was being considered, 
and that funds were being allocated for the socioeconomic 
development of these regions. He said it was outrageous that 
government agencies were responding to the complaints of 
forcibly evicted citizens by advising them to take the matter to 
court. He reminded the gathering that no member of a native 
ethnic group in Dagestan had complained of eviction from a 
Russian city on ethnic grounds. 
  According to Chief Palamarchuk of the Kizlyar municipal 
administration, the resolution of the problem will depend mainly 
on the activities of law enforcement agencies. Some local 
administrations are offering their services in the purchase and 
sale of real estate, but the Russians have had a mixed reaction 
to this.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina: "Despondent Russians Want To </F>
Leave Chechnya, but Neither Dudayev nor Yeltsin Can Guarantee 
Their Future"] 
  [Text] Republic government agencies have no statistics on 
the migration of the Russian population of Chechnya, including 
Cossacks, just as they lacked these figures two years ago. 
According to officials, and these statements seem reliable, this 
is not a mass "exodus." The people who make up the 
Russian-speaking population of the republic today, according to 
Groznyy's self-assured reports, are in complete agreement with 
the official aim of building a sovereign Chechen state. The 
"loyalty" of the Russian minority in Chechnya, however, seems 
more comparable to the submissive acceptance of circumstances 
than a conscious choice. A sociological survey conducted in 
Groznyy in December on a semi-legal basis by researchers from 
the Russian Academy of Sciences (a group from the academy 
Institute of Sociopolitical Research was driven out of Chechnya 
two years ago) indicated that 74 percent of the Russians, 
including Cossacks, wanted to leave sovereign Chechnya. After 
they had described the Russian Federation leadership's efforts 
to protect the rights of Russians in the republics of the 
Northern Caucasus as inadequate (an opinion expressed by 94 
percent of the respondents), 73 percent of the Russians said 
that in spite of the obvious, in their opinion, increase in 
interethnic friction in the republic, they could not afford to 
move and to settle down in today's federation without 
considerable help from the government and public organizations 
in Russia. 
  The recent campaign for the protection of the civil rights 
of 
the "Russian Caucasians" oppressed by Moscow officials virtually 
eclipsed the long petition Russians from Chechnya had sent to 
the Russian Federation president, chairman of the government, 
and heads of kray and oblast administrations. There has been no 
effective response yet to the petition with its 56-page 
supplement, citing cases in which Russians were the victims of 
physical assaults and harassment in 1992 and 1993 in Chechnya. 
Its authors are convinced, however, that the Chechen 
leadership's policy toward the Russian minority is intended to 
"drive out the Russians and Cossacks so that Russian territory 
can be taken over by Chechnya." Reminding the president of 
Russia that they were ineligible to vote in elections to the 
Federation Council and to participate in the discussion of the 
draft RF Constitution, the "former" citizens of the "former" 
Chechen-Ingush Republic reported that, in contrast to the 
Chechens living in Moscow and St. Petersburg and in Rostov, 
Tver, Volgograd, Novgorod, Astrakhan, and Orel oblasts, 
Stavropol Kray, and other regions, who are endowed with the same 
rights as citizens of Russia, they are not receiving wages, 
pensions, and benefits, were left out of the "voucherization" 
process, are not participating in the privatization of state 
property, and so forth. They were the first to be affected by 
the paralysis of industrial production in the republic. The 
"breadwinners" of Russian families--specialists--have lost their 
jobs. Teachers and physicians are being ousted from their 
position by their more fortunate Chechen colleagues (according 
to the sociological survey conducted by the Sociopolitical 
Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 55 
percent of the respondents in Groznyy reported the loss of 
administrative or prestigious positions on ethnic grounds). 
Russians are the main target of criminals in Chechnya: The 
authors of the petition informed the Russian president that they 
live in "constant fear" of thefts, violence, abductions, 
including the kidnapping of children, forcible eviction from 
apartments and private homes, and the seizure of private plots 
and motor vehicles. Although the crime rate in the republic is 
so high that President Dudayev even announced a special campaign 
to fight crime, Russians are unlikely to enjoy stronger legal 
protection at the end of the Chechen campaign. Republic 
officials have admitted that the 80-90 felonies a week (this is 
the official crime statistic for Chechnya) already require 
military intervention. 
  The uncertain relationship between Russia and Chechnya also 
precludes the protection of the Russian minority by the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has not received any 
"instructions from above" on these matters. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA learned that the Federal Migration 
Service of the Russian Federation is still the only agency in 
Russia from which the Russians from Chechnya can expect advice 
or assistance. According to the FMS staff, the service will 
provide Russians with a guaranteed address of a new place of 
residence and employment in any part of the country. A Moscow 
residence permit could be difficult to obtain unless the new 
arrival from Chechnya has relatives in Moscow, but even this 
problem has a solution: According to the information of the FMS, 
a residence permit for the capital of Russia can be purchased. 
In view of the fact that the average wage of civil servants in 
Chechnya in dollars amounts to only 6-8 "greenbacks," however, 
this is a largely theoretical possibility for the Russians from 
Chechnya.

  [Text] As of 1 February new procedures for allocating 
regional quotas for the exportation of strategic raw materials 
took effect in Irkutsk Oblast. Petroleum products, aluminum and 
pulp will be allocated by the administration for purchases of 
foodstuffs, medicines, medical equipment and shops and 
production facilities for the processing of agricultural raw 
materials. The amounts of the quotas are not yet being reported. 
An applicant must present the administration with a report on 
the use of the regional quota for the previous year, a 
calculation of the economic effectiveness of the proposed 
contract, or precontractual materials, which must include a 
specification of the exported product, the conditions of 
payment, the foreign exchange involved, a delivery schedule and 
a transportation plan. In the case of timber, a quota for logs 
in the amount of 1 million cubic meters will be put up for 
auction.

Administration of Statistics, the oblast exported $335.4 million 
worth of goods in 1993, a 75.8 percent increase as compared with 
1992. Specifically, export deliveries of the petrochemical

directly with the foreign partners. The developing countries 
accounted for 53 percent of the export deliveries, while the 
industrially developed countries, and primarily Germany, 
accounted for around 30 percent. Import comprised $115 million. 
Great Britain (20 percent) and Germany (14 percent) were among 
the primary suppliers. A large part of the import was comprised 
of sugar (19 percent of the overall volume of import) and 
equipment (17 percent).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Foreign Trade Turnover of Don </F>
Increases Due to Import"] 
  [Text] The foreign trade turnover of Rostov Oblast 
increased by 3.9 percent in 1993 as compared with 1992 and 
comprised $838 million, according to the data of the oblast 
administration foreign economic relations department. Of this, 
52.7 percent of the turnover was with the distant foreign 
countries and 47.3 percent with the nearby foreign countries. 
Export declined by 9.8 million, to a sum of $361 million. The 
relative share of deliveries of machinery and equipment declined 
from 60 percent in 1992 to 43 percent in 1993, while the 
relative share of raw goods and materials increased from 25 to 
34 percent, and of fuel--from 7 to 17 percent. Among the nearby 
foreign countries, Ukraine was in first place among the 
importers ($101.6 million), while Iran ($23.4 million) was the 
leading importer among the distant foreign countries. In the 
words of Aleksandr Balashov, deputy chief of the oblast 
administration foreign economic relations department, export in 
1993 was 11.5 percent below what was predicted. This was 
associated with limitations imposed under quotas and licenses, 
stoppages by major exporter enterprises due to non-payment, 
which were complicated by customs control on the border with 
Ukraine, as well as early (November) freezing over of the Rostov 
and Taganrog ports. Import to the oblast increased by 17.4 
percent in 1993, to a sum of $477 million. Ukraine accounted for 
almost one-fourth ($111 million) of the overall volume of import 
(metal products and equipment). Imports from the distant foreign 
countries were comprised primarily of food products and TNP 
[consumer goods]. Germany was in first place among these 
countries ($91 million).

<F P=106> [Interview with Daniya Zavdatovna Bagapova, deputy chairman </F>
of board of Central Volga Commercial Joint-Stock Bank, by Viktor 
Saklakov in Moscow and Samara; date not given: "The Bank of the 
Volga Region's Rebirth"] 
  [Text] The main goal of the staff of the Central 
Volga Commercial Joint-Stock Bank is the restoration of the 
Samara region's former reputation as one of the centers of 
Russian business. It is attaining this goal successfully. In 
just three years, the bank has become one of the largest 
financial institutions in the oblast. Its capital stock has 
increased from 60 million rubles to 6.5 billion. According to 
independent estimates (particularly the KOMMERSANT rating), it 
holds a steady position among the 20 most reliable banks in 
Russia. Our correspondent asked one of its administrators, 
Deputy Chairman of the Board D.Z. Bagapova, to say something 
about the operations of the bank. 
  "When we founded our bank, we were relying on the strength 
of 
regional industry," Daniya Zavdatovna said. "The founders 
included such well-known production units and organizations as 
the Samara Metallurgical Joint-Stock Company, the Samara 
Aircraft Engineering Enterprise, the Progress Plant, the 
Kuybyshev Railroad Administration, the Kuybyshevazot Joint-Stock 
Company, and others. We were naturally hoping to establish a 
stable, solid, and modern bank. This is not a simple task, 
particularly under present economic conditions, now that former 
state firms have had to enter into market relations so suddenly, 
without any preparation. Obviously, the difficulties inherent in 
this process have a direct effect on our operations. After all, 
serving the municipal and oblast economy can account for up to 
80 percent of the bank's operations. Nevertheless, in 1993 we 
managed to achieve a significant rise in most indicators and 
strengthen our position among the leading commercial financial 
institutions in the region. Our credit volume last year was 240 
billion rubles, and our profits were around 42 billion rubles." 
  [Saklakov] Many financiers are complaining that investments 
in economic development are tantamount to suicide in today's 
economy. What is your opinion? 
  [Bagapova] There is no question that investments in 
long-term 
projects always entail risks, but we are still doing this. The 
size of our investments is constantly growing. Our investments 
in the last nine months of last year amounted to a billion 
rubles. Of course, we are more likely to finance highly 
profitable ventures. We extended credit for the construction of 
a linoleum plant in Otradnyy, we took on the restoration of hops 
plantations, the products of which were once exported to almost 
every part of Europe, and we are supporting the development of 
the rural communities of the Volga Germans and other 
agricultural production units supplying the population with 
food. We could invest more, but the problem is the regrettable 
lack of so-called ready money in the country--i.e., funds 
available for fairly long-term loans, even at high rates of 
interest. It is impossible to concentrate only on the present. 
We have to find some way of developing our industry, and this 
cannot be done without "ready" money. The government should be 
the source of this money (or at least find ways of obtaining 
it). At this time, however, plants are using most of our credit 
to pay wages. The giants of metallurgy, the aerospace industry, 
and the petroleum industry are not getting anything from the 
center. It is as if we bankers are the only ones who care about 
the future of the economy and of the previously mentioned 
aircraft engineering plant. In fact, according to a recently 
passed law, the interest on deferred credit payments will come 
out of the bank's profits. 
  [Saklakov] Is there really no appreciation of the fact that 
you are participating in the development of leading enterprises? 
  [Bagapova] None at all! The law draws no distinctions 
whatsoever between us and the banks subsidizing commercial 
structures. Everyone is put in the same category, but the most 
surprising part of the whole situation is the constant violation 
of the precept that a law cannot be applied retroactively. It is 
only in our country that they can make a decision today and name 
some time in the distant past as the date it went into effect. 
The credit regulating fund of the Russian Central Bank is a good 
example of this. It would seem to be a good thing to have a 
strong national financial reserve to cover unpaid loans. We 
thought so when were depositing 20 percent of the bank's 
receipts in this fund. Today around 20 billion rubles of just 
our funds are frozen there. The money is being kept in the fund 
to no one's benefit, and there has not been a single case in 
which anyone has used the deposited funds as insurance. It is 
not even possible to buy the money at the Russian Central Bank 
loan rate for subsequent use. 
  [Saklakov] Is the possibility that common sense will prevail 
in our country someday our only hope? 
  [Bagapova] We are waiting impatiently for this day. No one 
wants to follow orders today, but legal standards, particularly 
in the interrelations of commercial banks with the Russian 
Central Bank and, consequently, with the state, must be more 
explicit. People have implied that we are simply profiting from 
economic difficulties, but this is certainly not the case. The 
government and the new parliament cannot leave the banking 
structure to its own devices. We need the kind of laws that will 
allow the banks, as the circulatory system of the state, to 
function in a beneficial atmosphere, with only limited 
interaction, as partners, with the Russian Central Bank. 
  [Saklakov] Please tell us about your work with your tens of 
thousands of private depositors. 
  [Bagapova] The residents of Samara Oblast have deposited 
more 
than 25 billion rubles in the bank and its 18 branches. We want 
to open bank service centers wherever possible (including some 
on the grounds of enterprises), and we are expanding our network 
of branches. We are the only bank in the oblast to make 
cost-of-living adjustments in deposits, and we are doing this at 
our own expense. Our consumer credit operations are extensive, 
and we buy and sell privatization checks, stock, and other 
securities. The public appreciates our bank's use of all of the 
tactics and strategy of its financial operations to guarantee 
the safety of deposits. Suffice it to say that our reserve fund 
already exceeds our capital stock. This means that we can insure 
our clients against many unforeseen developments. 
  [Saklakov] As I understand it, Daniya Zavdatovna, you 
readily 
offer services connected with foreign currency operations. 
  [Bagapova] The bank was granted a general license by the 
Russian Central Bank for all types of foreign currency 
operations. Enterprises in Samara are active in business abroad, 
and we intend to help them in these operations. We already have 
an administration for foreign economic operations and a network 
of currency exchange centers. We hope to extend credit in 
foreign currency in the future. 
  [Saklakov] What kind of relationship do you have with other 
banks? 
  [Bagapova] The days when new banks were viewed as rivals or 
as dire enemies are over. After all, each bank has found its own 
niche in the financial system, and now we have to unite our 
efforts, exchange information, and agree on a common approach to 
problems. I personally feel that the goal of our bank should not 
be the attraction of more clients by any means possible, but 
competition for clients with services of higher quality. We lose 
many opportunities when we do not bother to inform the public of 
our views on economic issues. It is time for bankers to be 
represented in the government and in legislative spheres. 
  [Saklakov] You come from a family of financial employees, 
and 
you know the traditions of this system. Do you sense a for 
technological changes in this field? 
  [Bagapova] We are understandably dissatisfied with many 
aspects of bank operations. It has been a long time since 
personal computers on the desks of staff members were a novelty, 
and now we hope to sign a contract with the Swiss IBS firm on 
comprehensive automation. This will allow us to offer our 
clients better service, increase the number of services, and 
speed up our operations dramatically, so that transactions can 
be finalized in a single day. This system will unite the central 
office with bank branches and with trade and consumer service 
enterprises and pave the way for the use of credit cards in this 
country and abroad. We hope to develop a network of our own, and 
not only in our own region. We plan to open branches in 180 
cities of the Russian Federation and the CIS countries. We are 
now analyzing financial flow charts in the interest of our 
clients, to determine different ways of making new business 
contacts. Our address is: 70 Ulitsa Frunze, Samara, 
Russia, 443099; tel: (8-846) 32-31-37, 32-05-20, 32-08-88; fax:

<F P=106> [Letter to KURANTY from Moscow subway officials: "Urgent: If </F>
Metro Shuts Down, Moscow Will Be Paralyzed"] 
  [Text] KURANTY has written about the very bleak 
outlook for the capital's metro. Since then the situation has 
become even more threatening: There have been several fires, 
trains have been halted for a long time, and it has become 
impossible to get to certain stations at rush hour. Despairing 
metro officials sent this letter to B. Yeltsin, in which they 
urge the government to take immediate action to help save the 
Moscow metro. 
  Dear Boris Nikolayevich! 
  For four years now, with the active assistance of the Moscow 
government, our labor collectives have been fighting for the 
right to build and operate the metro in a normal fashion. 
  This struggle stems from the need to resolve the matter of 
obtaining stable financing for capital investments for the 
development, rebuilding and modernization of the metro. 
  Every time we have to try to prove that financing the 
metro's 
development is not simply a concern of the city itself, but also 
of the Moscow region and the Russian capital, in that the metro 
is a key CIS transport and passenger-service hub that carries up 
to 9 million passengers each day. 
  For more than 63 years, all outlays for the metro's 
development have been borne by the state in the form of planned 
central capital investments, since the city alone cannot afford 
this. Construction of the metro never ceased even during the 
grimmest war years, when the German fascists were just 30 
kilometers from Moscow. 
  And now, despite the instructions of the Russian government, 
the Russian Federation Ministry of Economics is again failing to 
provide the required capital investment ceilings for the metro's 
development in 1994, without which the Russian Ministry of 
Finance cannot transfer funds to the metro. 
  Nor is the problem of indexing capital investments to the 
sharply rising inflation rate being solved in a timely fashion. 
The transfer of funds by the Russian Ministry of Finance is 
often delayed and extremely irregular. The failure to resolve 
the issue of allocating funds to repay indebtedness on credits 
in 1993 has put the metro in an exceptionally grave financial 
situation. 
  As of January 20 1994, the metro owed 33 billion rubles for 
work performed by contracting and design organizations and for 
trains and equipment installed by supplier plants. 
  The financial operations of construction, design, and 
machinery-building organizations for which the metro is the sole 
client (the Moscow Metro Construction State Joint-Stock Company, 
the Moscow Metro Reconstruction firm, several joint ventures in 
which the Transportation Engineering Construction firm is a 
partner, the State Metro Transport Design Institute, the Moscow 
Metro Design Institute, train-building plants in Mytishchi and 
St. Petersburg, the Escalator Plant in St. Petersburg, and other 
organizations) have been essentially paralyzed. 
  The Mytishchi and St. Petersburg machinery plants have 
halted 
work to modernize train cars' fire-safety systems. Contracting 
organizations have also stopped replacing escalators, fire 
alarms, and other equipment. 
  All these things are jeopardizing passenger safety. 
  Work to develop the metro has essentially come to stop, 
raising the question of halting the city's social development. 
  A volatile, prestrike atmosphere has arisen in the labor 
collectives of the Moscow Metro Construction State Joint-Stock 
Company and in other organizations. 
  The halt to financing of the metro's development is already 
leading to the collapse of unique construction and design 
organizations involved in building the metro and of the electric 
train and escalator plants in St. Petersburg and Mytishchi, 
which are the only plants of their kind not just in Russia but 
also in the CIS as a whole and whose sole customer is the Moscow 
metro. 
  Under these circumstances, it is hard to assess the 
socioeconomic consequences of the step taken by Russian Ministry 
of Economics for the city and the entire Moscow region. 
  In view of the inadmissibility of an interruption in the 
construction, operation, and modernization of the metro, its 
exceptional social importance for the city and the Moscow 
region, and the lack of any alternative solution to the very 
difficult transportation problem in the city, the 40,000-strong 
labor collective of the Moscow metro and the Metro Construction 
State Joint-Stock Company asks you, Boris Nikolayevich to 
urgently instruct: 

  -  the Russian Ministry of Economics to notify the Russian 
Ministry of Finance of a capital investment ceiling of 635 
million rubles in 1991 prices, which, according to the metro's 
calculations, amounts to 1,400 billion rubles in 1994 prices; 
  -  the Russian Ministry of Finance to resolve, in January 1994, 
the matter of transferring 33 billion rubles to the metro to 
repay indebtedness on credits and, in approving the federal 
budget, to provide in the first quarter of 1994 for the 
financing of capital investments to develop the metro in the 
amount of 350 billion rubles, with a view to repaying 1993 
indebtedness on credits and making down payments on the purchase 
of construction materials, equipment, rolling stock and cable 
products. 

    [Signed] Ye. Dubenko, director of the Moscow Metro V. Pskov, 
chairman of the Metro Railroad Workers Trade Union Committee Yu. 
Kopelev, general director of the Moscow Metro Construction State 
Joint-Stock Company N. Reymid, chairman of the Railroad Workers 
Trade Union Committee

<F P=106> [Article by Sergei Shmelyov: "Radioactive Moscow"] </F>
  [Text] To say that Moscow is becoming a radioactive 
disposal site is like saying that a heroine-mother is becoming a 
woman. Unfortunately, our capital is long been such a disposal 
site. 
  Employees of the Radon Scientific Production Association 
cleaned up 1,160 radioactive contamination sites in Moscow and 
vicinity from 1979 to 1992. 
  So-called "historical" radioactive wastes account for a 
large 
part of these nonplanned radioactive waste sites. According to 
secret instructions issued by the People's Commissariat of 
Internal Affairs, spent radioactive substances were buried 
underground (in undeveloped areas, refuse dumps, ravines, and 
ditches) at what was considered a safe depth--one at which gamma 
radiation at the surface would not exceed 300 microroentgens per 
hour. But yesterday's outskirts and undeveloped areas are now 
being built up. 
  There was no system to track migration of radiation 
emitters. 
No one kept a map of the burial sites, which was simply 
impossible. 
  Today these radioactive remains are "surfacing" in the most 
unpredictable places--flowerbeds, children's sandboxes, bomb 
shelters, beach restrooms, private apartments, garages, 
basements, military compounds. 
  In addition to the "historical" radioactive waste sites, new 
"pirate" dumps are being discovered from time to time. 
  Two instruments with ionizing radiation emitters were 
recently found in a pile of construction refuse on Shcherbakov 
Street. A container of thorium ore was found at the building at 
6 Donskaya Street, and a one-kilogram cobblestone emitting a 
small amount of radiation was found on Saykin Street. 
  A metallic emitter giving off 630,000 microroentgens per 
hour 
was accidentally found by an electrician in a basement at the 
Hammer and Sickle Plant. (Average background radiation in the 
Russia's central belt 10 to 15 microroentgens per hour, and 15 
to 20 in cities.) 
  A "radioactive" private garage was discovered this winter on 
Fersman Street. The wood floor and metal covering were "glowing" 
in places at up to 900 microroentgens per hour. 
  Just three months ago, workers finished clearing up the 
notorious 26th kilometer of the Moscow Ring Road, where nearby 
vacant lot occupies the site of a former refuse dump. The 
operation took almost seven years. That's how long it took our 
wise city fathers to just to solve some simple organizational 
matters and to come up with the best plan for containing the 
site. 
  There were some spots emitting abnormally high radioactivity 
at up to 720,000 microroentgens per hour. Now the radiation has 
been reduced to the standard average European level. A parking 
lot will be built on the site. 
  A building housing a former hydropathic treatment facility 
at 
Hospital No. 54 in Eastern Okrug was giving off 72,000 
microroentgens per hour. The heating battery was especially 
contaminated. The radiation emitted by some construction refuse, 
books, and abandoned equipment parts was somewhat lower. 
  Initial measurements in the yard of an apartment building on 
Chernyshevskiy Street in Elektrostal revealed surface 
radioactivity of up to 600 microroentgens per hour. 
  Almost 60 metric tons of low-radioactive soil and slag was 
removed from Noginsk and Ramenskiy. And it's still not certain 
that no more remains. 
  The main radioactive items that the clean-up crews have 
found 
in Moscow are chemical vessels, phosphors, foil, ruberoid, ore 
specimens, reference ionizing radiation emitters, and parts of 
various instruments and smoke detectors containing radioactive 
elements. 
  Thefts of radioactive materials for resale made their 
"season 
premiere." A container with 16 kilograms of thorium sand was 
found by a police patrol right outside the Kursk Train Station. 
According to the markings, the contraband was being sent from 
India to Japan. Our customs service is sometimes simply unable 
to identify radioactive materials. In addition to those in 
Moscow, "pirate" radioactive waste sites have been found in St. 
Petersburg, Irkutsk, Izhevsk, Kansk, Maykop, Iskitim, and 
Gatchina. 
  Not a single fundamental issue relating to radiation safety 
has been solved in the form of legislation as yet. 
  We're going to start dying not from food shortages, but from 
contaminated foods.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Pushkov: "Kozyrev Has Begun Play on </F>
Another's Home Field"] 
  [Text] Andrey Kozyrev's attempts to play Zhirinovskiy 
on his field can only seriously damage Russian diplomacy. 
  Andrey Kozyrev's statement last week at a meeting with 
ambassadors of Russia in states of the CIS and the Baltic evoked 
a stormy reaction abroad and remains at the center of attention 
as the "latest word" in the changing Russian foreign policy. 
This, literally, is what Kozyrev said: "The CIS countries and 
the Baltic are the area in which Russia's main vital interests 
are concentrated. The main threats to these interests come from 
there.... In my view, the framing of the question of the total 
departure and removal of any military presence of Russia in the 
states of the near abroad is just as extreme, if not extremist, 
an approach as the idea of the dispatch of tanks to all the 
republics and the establishment of some imperial order there...." 
  Despite the subsequent explanations of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and the refutations of Kozyrev himself, these 
words were seen everywhere as Russia's intention to maintain the 
Russian military presence in the Baltic republics and as a 
consequence of the increased national-patriotic trends in 
Moscow's policy. 
  It would have been hard to choose a less suitable time for 
such words. They were heard several days after the departure 
from Moscow of U.S. President Bill Clinton and a week after the 
NATO Council session in Brussels, which had adopted the decision 
to take account of Russian concern at the prospect of an 
expansion of NATO and to postpone until some time in the future 
the question of the admittance to the bloc of Poland, Hungary, 
and the Czech Republic. These countries, like Russia also, were 
offered partnership with NATO in the military-political sphere. 
  If Kozyrev has seen this turn of events and the decisive 
support which Clinton expressed for Yeltsin in Moscow as 
carte-blanche for toughening Russian policy in respect to the 
near abroad, the Baltic countries primarily, this is a flagrant 
miscalculation. There is no unity on the attitude toward Russia 
either in NATO or even within the Clinton administration itself. 
The delicate balance in favor of Russia which has been created 
in the Western countries could be disturbed at any moment. 
Particularly now, when the signals emanating from Moscow are 
being scrutinized in the latter literally with a magnifying 
glass in an attempt to discern in them possible influence on 
Russian foreign policy on the part of conservatives and 
nationalists. 
  Assertions are being heard increasingly loudly in the West 
that a refusal to admit to NATO Poland, the Czech Republic, and 
Hungary under pressure from Moscow is tantamount to appeasement 
of a potential aggressor, that is, Russia, and that this bodes 
ill. Had the supporters of such an approach, Warsaw 
particularly, required new arguments in support of the argument 
concerning a revival of the threat on the part of Russia, 
Kozyrev has given them such. 
  Kozyrev has said repeatedly that he is pursuing the 
president's foreign policy: the president formulates it, the 
Foreign Ministry merely implements it. 
  It may be assumed, therefore, that Kozyrev was complying 
with 
a directive of Yeltsin himself, whose tone in respect to the 
near abroad, Ukraine particularly, has become noticeably tougher 
as of late. Nor can it be ruled out that the president was 
extremely incensed by the recent arrest in Latvia of the head of 
the group of Russian forces stationed there. Such anger is 
entirely justified. But should we be paying Riga back in the 
same coin, playing into the hands of the Lettish nationalists? 
Especially since Riga apologized profusely to Moscow in this 
connection. But instead of turning the situation--a potentially 
winning one for us--to good account, the leader of the Foreign 
Ministry decided to hew away with an ax, and ax work in 
politics, as in other spheres also, for that matter, does not 
produce good results. 
  A different scenario is, for that matter, more likely. 
Availing himself of his sufficient freedom in determination of 
our foreign policy positions, Kozyrev deemed it necessary to 
take account of the new winds that have as of late been blowing 
over Russia and blowing out of the government some of its 
members. He decided, it would seem, to forestall events in order 
to kill three birds with one stone: to create for himself the 
image of a tougher politician, to shore up thereby his position 
in the Chernomyrdin cabinet, and to display personal zeal to the 
president. 
  Kozyrev "developed," as it were, Yeltsin's New Year's 
statement of Russia's intent to defend more decisively the 
rights of its compatriots in the near abroad (it elicited in the 
West a heightened and somewhat unhealthy interest, 
incidentally), but was extremely unsuccessful in so doing. If 
the president, wishing to rectify a manifest failing in his 
policy, decided to say "A," this does not mean that the minister 
has immediately to blurt out all the other letters of the 
alphabet. 
  Kozyrev has for some time now given the impression that he 
wants to neutralize, as it were, the charges of constant 
concessions to the West and of insufficiently active defense of 
Russia's national interests by greater toughness in respect to 
the countries of the near abroad. This calculation is, however, 
very dangerous. First, because a desire to touch up his 
hard-to-correct "image" of Westerner and "dove" could prompt the 
minister to a severity in positions and statements which 
harms--is already harming--Russia's interests. Kozyrev's own 
efforts, for example, to secure for Russia a mandate of the 
United Nations and the CSCE for peacekeeping operations in the 
CIS. Second, because Kozyrev has already created an entirely 
different image of Russian diplomacy in the West, and so abrupt 
a change therein could evoke only wariness. People are already 
puzzled there: Yesterday Kozyrev was saying one thing, today, 
another, is Russia really, consequently, returning to an 
imperial policy? 
  Finally, all this is creating the impression of attempts to 
wrest the initiative from Zhirinovskiy. But only defeat could 
await Kozyrev in such a contest. The sole solution here is to 
counterpose to Zhirinovskiy's aggressive propaganda rhetoric a 
profoundly considered policy of defense of our interests which 
produces real results. In a word, Russia's policy in respect to 
the near abroad undoubtedly does need adjusting, but Kozyrev is 
hardly the most suitable figure for this. 
  And, finally, the hint heard in his recent television 
appearances at Zhirinovskiy's "legal" origins--what has he got 
to do with the Russian people and the defense of their 
rights?--can evoke nothing but consternation. Vladimir Volfovich 
will hardly be outdone in the use of such methods. But one's own 
reputation could be damaged conclusively.

<F P=106> [Article Liana Minasyan: "Andrey Kozyrev Strengthens the </F>
`Eurasian Connection': Minister's Visit to Central and Southeast 
Asia"] 
  [Text] The CIS part of the January tour by Andrey Kozyrev, 
minister of foreign affairs of Russia, of Central and Southeast 
Asia began more than well. In Kyrgyzstan the meeting with 
President Askar Akayev was a demonstration of mutual affection. 
"Boris Nikolayevich regards you with affection, and there is no 
concealing this," the Russian minister remarked to the Kyrgyz 
president. "You are a refined, highly intelligent person with 
firm democratic convictions, and this brings you close to Boris 
Nikolayevich." Kozyrev had brought to Bishkek a message from 
Yeltsin, which, we were to understand, gave high marks to the 
official program for stabilization of the position of the 
Russian-speaking population overseen by Akayev himself. Russia, 
in turn, promised "as much economic assistance as possible" to 
support the enterprises at which this Russian-speaking 
population is employed. The actual expression of the assistance 
will be determined at the time of the future visit to Kyrgyzstan 
of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Meanwhile, the fact that 
Kozyrev's first trip in the new year began in Bishkek 
immediately prior to the referendum on confidence in President 
Akayev could have served as a kind of pointer to how the 
Russian-speaking population should determine its sympathies at 
the time of the ballot. Kozyrev declared that Akayev's approach 
to the problem--"respect for citizens who have to live where 
they live and work there also--is working for the sovereignty of 
Kyrgyzstan and its prestige." The minister disapproved, on the 
contrary, of the position of the former Soviet republics which 
believe that "they are asserting their sovereignty" (which, 
according to him, no one disputes) "by pushing out the Russian 
population. We will not be insensitive to this." 
  The parties signed a consular convention, and Askar Akayev 
described the relations of the two countries as a "strengthening 
of the Eurasian connection" and defined their three main sources 
and ingredients: the strengthening of sovereignty, the 
preservation of the "spring of Russian culture and language," 
thanks to which "Kyrgyzstan arose" (he proposed making the 
Slavonic University, which opened last year, a regional 
university and retaining Russian as an official language), and, 
finally, the choice of Russia as principal ally--"Russia has 
always had interests here, and they should be preserved." "Who 
said," Kozyrev observed in response, "that we have to choose 
between East and West? We are in both places, we have no 
inferiority complex." 
  The president of Kyrgyzstan identified his position on the 
question of dual citizenship as follows: As a constitutional 
provision, it would signify the disintegration of a country in 
which 80 nationalities, including 20 major ethnic groups, live. 
The matter can be resolved on the basis of a bilateral 
interstate agreement. Kozyrev confirmed that a treaty basis, 
which would help determine the balance of rights and obligations 
in order to avoid a "dual burden," was needed for a solution of 
this question. No state, he observed, should fear damage to its 
sovereignty, and citizens on its territory should be subordinate 
to the laws, although they could have supplementary rights also. 
Dual-citizenship status could give rise to uncertain cases for 
Russia also. 
  As far as can be judged, a legislative initiative in the 
parliament of Kyrgyzstan on the question of citizenship could 
evoke an ambivalent response. The arrangements with Turkmenistan 
and Kyrgyzstan, which were arrived at relatively painlessly, are 
assets for Russia, but it is in these countries that the 
position of Russian speakers is for various reasons the least 
acute. In addition, the intentions of the leader of the country 
could to a certain extent also adjust the position of his 
closest neighbors--Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan--which occupy a far 
tougher position on this matter and would hardly receive with 
enthusiasm a breakthrough on the "Kyrgyz flank." Kozyrev 
himself, for that matter, is not inclined to consider this 
position insurmountable. Responding to a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
question as to what principle could be made the basis of dual 
citizenship for Russian speakers--ethnic or linguistic--he said: 
"This question is extraordinarily complex, and it should not be 
oversimplified but decided in each specific case--with regard 
both to our national legislation and treaties with the 
corresponding states. In some republics the agreements would 
have their own specific features, and the approach would not be 
ethnic, of course, but, if you wish, a `human-rights' approach. 
It is quite complex to resolve this problem with any republic, 
but no one is now refusing to discuss the question of 
citizenship altogether because there could be various versions 
of a solution. A delegation of Uzbekistan headed by the acting 
chairman of the Supreme Council has just been in Moscow, and I 
have had a very detailed telephone conversation with Nazarbayev. 
In a week I plan to visit Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. The main 
thing is that there be no hysteria over the problem: The task is 
to prevent passions becoming inflamed. A demonstration of our 
'heroism'--we stick to our guns--would give rise only to a 
reluctance to talk on their part. This stage has been 
negotiated, we are now at the stage of actual work on what the 
balance of rights and obligations should be. Insofar as the 
problem of dual citizenship has, truly, absolutely not been 
settled." 
  Before the start of his visit to China, the minister of 
foreign affairs conducted a regional conference with the heads 
of the border oblasts, at which he promised them that he would 
open up Russian regions for relations with their neighbors, but 
"intelligently, not recklessly." He confirmed that the problem 
of the mass entry and "settlement" of Chinese in Russia had 
created a tense situation, and for this reason the 1993 
agreement had radically reduced the number of persons entitled 
to non-visa entry. But the minister proposed that border trade, 
which has helped the population of the Far East resolve to a 
large extent the problem of what to eat and with what to clothe 
itself, be switched from the tourist-bag to the interregional 
and interstate level. The surplus balance in trade with China 
(Russia's second largest trading partner) has amounted to $2.5 
billion and has surpassed in terms of volume the peak of the 
trade of the whole of the USSR in 1990. True, the Far East 
authorities are complaining that they are trading mainly with 
China's northeast provinces, from where goods of inferior 
quality to those produced in the south are being "palmed off" on 
them. Nonetheless, as Amur Governor Polevanov declared, "Chinese 
expansion in the Far East is a reality with which we are forced 
to reckon." According to him, there is no legislation that 
determines the legal position of foreigners under the conditions 
of the "nonforcible settlement" of the region by the Chinese. He 
supported the idea of the creation of a free trade zone here and 
gave as an example his neighbors, who have made provision for 
concessionary taxation for potential investors. The governor 
proposed that up to 70 percent of customs payments going to the 
treasury remain in the oblast and also handed over an appeal to 
President Yeltsin consenting to the construction of a cosmodrome 
in Svobodnyy, at the former place of deployment of a missile 
unit. In Beijing Andrey Kozyrev held talks with the Chinese 
leaders. After a meeting with his colleague, Qian Qichen, he 
declared that the two countries' relations could be raised to 
the level of constructive partnership, which signifies, if not 
allied relations, close interaction, in any event. Agreement was 
reached on the continuation of top-level contacts--PRC Chairman 
Jiang Zemin will visit Moscow, and before this, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin will make a trip to China. The heads of the foreign 
policy departments also discussed questions of a border 
settlement. Since the end of the 1950's, Kozyrev observed, 
negotiations on territorial demarcation were the main irritant 
in Soviet-Chinese relations. Today an agreement on the eastern 
sector of the common border, and this is 4,300 km from Maritime 
Kray to Mongolia, has been concluded between Russia and China 
and ratified. The parties have agreed to maintain the status quo 
until the completion of its demarcation. "The demarcation will 
be undertaken on the basis of the incontestable criteria of 
international law," the Russian minister said, and although 
discussion of the problem continues, Russia and China have 
deemed it possible, with the participation of the border 
regions, to undertake joint economic activity on the disputed 
territories. Negotiations on border issues will continue also on 
the western sector of the border between China and a joint 
delegation of four states--Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and 
Uzbekistan. Understanding was reached on an easing of the 
border-crossing conditions for inhabitants of the border areas, 
but also on undesirable "side occurrences" being taken under 
control (according to Jiang Zemin, "when a door is opened, flies 
also may fly in together with the good people"). At the end 
of the visit Andrey Kozyrev described the present relations as 
follows: "We have passed the stage of inheritance of the Soviet 
Union and, after a long normalization of relations, we have 
switched to normal cooperation." The specific forms of this 
cooperation should be determined during the visit to Beijing of 
Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. Kozyrev termed his tour of China's 
provinces, on the other hand, preparation for a favorable 
climate. In, particularly, Shenzhen, a special economic zone, 
and in Shenxi, where the lion's share of enterprises built with 
the participation of the Soviet Union is concentrated and in 
whose reconstruction, in the minister's opinion, there would be 
no harm in Russia participating. The minister evaluated the 
experience of the special economic zone in the south of China as 
a regional version of China's reforms, "a very specific 
experiment under very specific conditions," and proposed that 
there be no illusions as to the possibility of it being copied, 
even less "idealized and ideologized." The prospects of 
relations with China afforded the minister a reason, for that 
matter, to call this country also the "near abroad" inasmuch as, 
according to him, "there are no first-and second-class foreign 
countries, and China is our neighbor. I am trying to introduce 
this concept in its healthy meaning: The near abroad means all 
our immediate neighbors." Nor, in this connection, did the 
minister overlook domestic problems: "Talk about Russian 
neo-imperialism merely diverts attention from the real problems 
connected with Russia's special role in the CIS. Maintaining 
stability there is in the interests of the entire Eurasian 
region. I propose that those in the West who have an interest in 
this help our efforts. Those, however, who think that they could 
not reach agreement with me and will find someone else are 
mistaken. They do not know our internal situation or the 
composition of the State Duma--I invite them to make themselves 
acquainted."

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Lavrov, deputy minister of foreign </F>
affairs of the Russian Federation: "Bombing in Bosnia?"] 
  [Text] The Bosnian conflict--extremely serious and 
dangerous in and of itself--is acquiring an additional critical 
aspect in connection with calls for outside intervention 
involving the use of force. This concept has already been 
advanced repeatedly by certain Western and developing countries 
in response to the demands of Bosnian Muslims. In all instances, 
the threat to use force has been directed at the Bosnian Serbs. 
  The subject of "air strikes against the Serbs" has once 
again 
become a central topic. After the January session of the NATO 
Council declared the readiness of the alliance to use air power 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia's State Duma appealed to it. 
The mass media have treated the NATO decision entirely 
superficially, detaching it from the history of the issue. 
Intentionally or not, this leads to inflamed passions and 
incorrect conclusions, including with respect to Russia's 
position and the role of the United Nations. 
  Here is the history of the issue. Russia has never supported 
the use of military methods to resolve the problems of the 
crisis in Yugoslavia, especially through intervention involving 
the use of force by the world community against one of the 
Bosnian sides. When such proposals came rushing into the United 
Nations, Russia insisted on a more well-considered and balanced 
approach toward all participants in the conflict. As a result, 
the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council 
permitting use of force in Bosnia and Herzegovina contain rigid 
criteria and restrictions. First of all, actions of force are 
possible only in three cases: if an attack is conducted against 
a convoy carrying humanitarian assistance (Resolution 771, 
August 1992); if one of the sides violates the no-fly zone in 
the airspace over Bosnia (Resolution 816, March 1993); or if one 
of the conflict participants directly hinders the UN Protection 
Force, Yugoslavia from carrying out its mandate in the security 
zones (Resolution 836, June 1993). 
  Secondly, all United Nations documents clearly establish 
that 
coercive measures may be used against any side guilty of actions 
prohibited by the Security Council, not just against the Bosnian 
Serbs. Thirdly, in all decisions, we are talking only about the 
threat to use force--its direct application requires special 
supplemental procedure involving the participation of the 
secretary general of the United Nations and members of the 
Security Council. 
  Fourthly, the Security Council has invited UN member states 
and regional organizations to undertake "all necessary measures" 
to facilitate the implementation of resolutions, but has 
stipulated one steadfast condition: Such measures may be taken 
only "under the direction of the Security Council" and "in close 
coordination with the secretary general of the United Nations 
and UN Protection Force, Yugoslavia." 
  In August 1993, NATO responded to this proposal. The North 
Atlantic alliance declared that it was prepared to participate 
in operations related to the conduct of air strikes in 
accordance with a United Nations Security Council resolution and 
under its direction, i.e., strictly within the framework 
established by the international community. 
  Now the question of bombing has resurfaced in the January 
NATO Declaration. But the leaders of the alliance state in this 
document that they are prepared to conduct air strikes only 
under the direction of the Security Council. Thus, there have 
been no changes in NATO's fundamental position since August of 
last year. It is another matter that the time of emergence of 
this new declaration is difficult to consider an apt choice. Its 
underlying anti-Serbian message clearly did not further the 
normal course of the Geneva negotiations among the parties in 
conflict, although it did not prevent the Serbs and Croats from 
affixing their signatures to a bilateral agreement. Once again 
the Muslims have convinced themselves of the illusion that 
someone will support them with force. To a certain degree the 
readiness to conduct air strikes also contradicts the 
propositions voiced at that same session of the NATO Council 
concerning a peaceful settlement to the conflict. 
  Russia shares the UN position in the Bosnian crisis. The 
"Blue Helmets" command headquarters in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
has already stated many times that in the event air strikes are 
inflicted, an escalation of combat operations may follow. All 
peacemaking forces in the former Yugoslavia will find themselves 
under direct threat. 
  Nonetheless, the decision of the NATO Council shows once 
again that an answer must be found to the question of how to 
further develop United Nations cooperation with regional 
organizations. Precedents in this regard already exist. The 
United Nations Security Council adopted resolutions in support 
of peacemaking efforts of the Organization of American States in 
Central America and the Organization of African Unity in Liberia. 
  This same experience can be applied to the task of 
maintaining peace in the territory of the former USSR, where the 
United Nations could cooperate with CIS mechanisms in matters of 
maintaining peace. The necessary legal base for this has been 
established in the Commonwealth: Agreements have been reached on 
collective peacemaking forces and groups of military observers. 
In accordance with decisions of the Ashkgabat summit meeting 
which took place last December, the CIS requested that the 
United Nations afford the Commonwealth UN observer status. 
  All in all, this experience must be studied and more precise 
criteria drawn up based on it with respect to how regional 
organizations can settle conflicts through peaceful means.

Androsenko: "What Impudence! They Are Scooping Up Our Fish With 
Their Nets, Taking Advantage of the Fever Russia Is Running: The 
Public Demands That the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Russian Federation Immediately and Resolutely Put an End to 
Foreign Fishing Piracy in the Sea of Okhotsk"] 
  [Text] Magadan--For three years now foreign fishermen 
have played the master in the neutral section of the Sea of 
Okhotsk. Nature has preordained it that the migration routes of 
schools of pollock in the Sea of Okhotsk run through the 
"neutral zone." So, the newcomers engage in uncontrolled, 
quota-free fishing here, undercutting the fishing resources of 
the entire basin. 
  How did last year end there? 
  Alas, it is hardly reassuring. Dozens of foreign 
supertrawlers continue to operate in the "neutral zone." 
According to estimates by scientists, they caught about 1 
million tonnes of pollock last year. 
  The Russian Government has taken some measures to solve the 
problem. Two conferences with the participation of all 
interested parties have been convened. Unfortunately, their 
effectiveness proved to be low. South Korea was the only one to 
promise to completely discontinue operations in neutral waters 
and kept its word, having been granted in return the right to 
catch 32,000 tonnes of pollock in our zone. 
  Undoubtedly, this is a more civilized way to settle issues 
in 
dispute. The position of the South Koreans was strongly 
influenced by their participation in many contracts with 
Russians which could otherwise have been canceled. We do not 
have such contracts with other countries, hence the 
consequences. At first, the Poles announced that they will cut 
back operations by 25 percent, but did not withdraw a single 
vessel. Our specialists believe that their promise is hollow, 
all the more so because at the second meeting the Polish side 
did not even mention it. The Chinese refused to discuss this 
issue at all. Fishermen from these two countries still 
constitute the shock "poaching" force. 
  The moratorium on fishing in the neutral section of the Sea 
of Okhotsk announced by Russia accomplished nothing. Our 
fishermen withdrew, but foreigners do not give a damn about the 
Russian moratorium. After all, present-day Russia is neither the 
USSR nor America, which, after detecting a threat to the pollock 
population in the Bering Sea, instantly found ways to influence 
Poland, China, and Korea. As a result, their moratorium is very 
strictly complied with, and vessels which operated in the 
"neutral zone" of the Bering Sea have migrated to the Sea of 
Okhotsk, thus augmenting the already powerful pressure on it. 
  At present 30-35 Polish trawlers and 15-20 Chinese trawlers 
continuously operate in the ill-fated region. Vessels flying the 
Panamanian flag have appeared. A supertrawler from the Baltic 
area fished for a period of time, but left quickly. As far as 
the Ukrainian refrigerator ships the Bukhta Omega and the 
Sevastopolskaya Bukhta are concerned, they have apparently been 
coming here for a long time. They pick up fish from the Poles 
and take it to the West. Perhaps this is way Ukraine is 
"thanking" Russia for the oil and gas delivered to it. Recently, 
even an American tanker was spotted here, which is also symbolic 
because previously the Americans behaved properly. 
  Fishing inspectorate organs closely monitor the situation in 
the Sea of Okhotsk. Last year four specialized 
fishing-inspection vessels of the Commodore class took turns 
spending about 200 days in the neutral waters. Surveillance was 
also conducted from the air. Fifteen violations of the Russian 
economic zone were detected; five Polish and Chinese vessels 
were seized. In the process, fishing inspectors note that 
violators are aware of our weakness and for this reason are 
"raiding" the economic zone increasingly often and behaving ever 
more arrogantly. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA has reported on the case of 
the Chinese trawler Geng Hai in which its crew, which was caught 
red-handed, refused to proceed to a Russian port. A patrol ship 
of the border guard that was called in to assist arrived at the 
site of the event as late as the sixth day: Fuel had to be 
collected from the vessels of the entire brigade for the patrol 
ship to be able to put out to sea. 
  The episode with the Polish supertrawler Amaryl proved even 
more instructive. Having seen that the unarmed fishing 
inspectors were getting no reinforcement from the border guard, 
the captain reported this to his company, and got the following 
response: "The fishing inspectors shall be put on a skiff and 
sent to their vessel, with safety rules observed," which was 
done immediately. 
  There is food for thought for the government here. If it is 
not in a position to provide fuel for the ships of the border 
guard, which has so far been officially responsible for 
protecting the economic zone, should we perhaps take the path 
that the Americans and the Japanese took and arm the fishing 
inspectorate, granting it the relevant status? After all, it is 
clear that emergency measures must be taken; otherwise, poachers 
will very soon begin to penetrate not only the economic zone but 
the territorial waters of Russia. 
  Funding for the services of the fishing inspectorate is 
still 
the weak element. Under our conditions, a combination of 
seaborne and airborne surveillance in which airborne observers 
quickly pass on the coordinates of violators to inspectorate 
vessels is the most efficient. However, the number of aircraft 
sorties fell by a factor of 10 last year compared to 1990 
because of lack of funds. 
  The Russian Federation Committee on Fishing allocated for 
these purposes insignificant fishing quotas, with the fish 
earmarked for sale. These actions caused furious criticism from 
the Ministry of Ecology and its local divisions which, instead 
of coordinating efforts to protect natural resources, continue 
the course of harsh confrontation with the Committee on Fishing. 
Could the fact that the allocation of such quotas has now been 
approved by the head of the government bring the prolonged 
debate to closure now? 
  Incidentally, the quotas for "keeping up the pants" of the 
fishing inspectorate and fisheries research do not cause 
unfavorable emotions among fish producers. They fully understand 
that by yielding a little, they stand to win much more from the 
actions of these services. 
  In general, resolution of the fishing piracy issue comes 
down 
to the question of whether Russia will be a strong state which 
nearby and faraway neighbors will begin to reckon with. For now, 
the reverse process is underway here.

"Full-Fledged Membership Is a Necessity. Russia Has Filed a 
Petition To Join the Executive Committee of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees"] 
  [Text] In recent years the refugee problem which has 
alarmed the world for decades has directly affected Russia, too. 
A stream of victims of interethnic conflicts in the post-Soviet 
space and victims of national discrimination in the former 
republics of the Soviet Union has rushed to Russia. 
  This was perhaps the main reason the Russian Federation 
filed 
a petition to be admitted as a member of the Executive Committee 
of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. This UN structure was 
created as early as 1951 when a number of countries developed 
and signed the UN Convention on Refugee Status. Russia also 
signed this convention in May of last year, thus assuming the 
requisite obligations. If the UN approves the Russian 
petition--and at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian 
Federation they assure us that this will most likely be the 
case--the observer status which Russia has at present will be 
converted into full-fledged membership. This will not impose any 
additional financial obligations on the state because the budget 
of the Executive Committee is formed on a voluntary basis. 
  Two laws actually apply in Russia at present--"On Refugees" 
and "On Forced Resettlers." This is why it is important to 
determine who is who. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia 
believes that otherwise it will be very difficult to take 
measures aimed at solving their problems. It is necessary to 
solve three problems in order to settle the refugee crisis. 
  First, we should make every effort to try and extinguish 
conflicts on the territory of the former USSR which constitute 
the ground zero of human waves sweeping toward Russia, and solve 
the problem of discrimination against the Russian-speaking 
population in the former Soviet republics, primarily in the 
Baltic countries by signing relevant agreements with them. 
Incidentally, they are now doing this at Smolenskaya Square 
quite intensively. 
  The second problem is to set up a living for refugees and 
forced resettlers; this is handled by the Federal Migration 
Service (FMS) which was created in 1992. However, given the 
tremendous number of people seeking assistance from the FMS, it 
has not been in a position to fine-tune its operation in a 
civilized manner over this short period of time. This is why it 
is very important for Russia to become a member of the Executive 
Committee of the UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees]. The Administrations of the High Commissioner which 
have been created in Moscow, Georgia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan 
are already helping to solve problems associated with migration. 
Obtaining membership in the UNHCR Executive Committee will help 
Russia to use the potential of this organization to the fullest 
extent. As early as the meetings of the Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe in Rome and the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council in Brussels late last year, the head of the 
foreign policy establishment of Russia Andrey Kozyrev proposed 
to make the institution of the High Commissioner for Refugees 
more effective and to reinforce it. These Russian initiatives 
were laid down in the Declaration on Aggressive Nationalism, 
whose text was also proposed by Moscow. 
  Cooperation between the Russian Federation and the UNHCR has 
already produced favorable results: On 13 January of this year a 
communique resolving the issue of the return of resettlers from 
Georgia and Abkhazia was signed during Russian-Abkhazian 
negotiations with the cooperation of the Administration of the 
High Commissioner. 
  The third task is to prepare and begin actions to resolve 
the 
problems of foreigners from faraway foreign countries who are 
staying in Russian territory illegally. So far, no procedure at 
all has been developed for them. As we were told at the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to some estimates we have 
0.5 million of them. There are many refugees from Afghanistan, 
Angola, and Somalia. The Kurds account for a significant 
proportion. There are also natives of Ethiopia, China, and Sri 
Lanka. All of them cannot be ignored: After all, according to 
the 1951 convention, a person is under its protection from the 
moment of filing a petition to be granted refugee status. 
  Having become a member of the UNHCR Executive Committee, 
Russia will be able to influence the enhancement of its role in 
the world system in resolving emergency situations: famine, 
natural cataclysms, military conflicts, and so on. The structure 
of the UNHCR should continuously be the focus for solving the 
problems of refugees, and should coordinate work on their 
reception and provisioning which is also done by various 
organizations such as the International Red Cross, the 
International Children's Fund, the UN Food and Agriculture 
Organization, and a number of nongovernmental institutions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Fedotov, Russian ambassador to </F>
UNESCO, by special correspondent Yuliya Rakhayeva; place and 
date not given: "Our Man in UNESCO"] 
  [Text] Mikhail Fedotov is an amazing person. No, honestly. 
In his youth--imagine--he was a Framist and shocked decent 
citizens (during the second half of the sixties there was a 
well-known literary group called "Fram" which debated with the 
renowned SMOG. Then he changed his mind and returned to family 
tradition: Fedotov is a fourth-generation lawyer. 
  I met him in the autumn of 1990 in the Moscow City Court 
where the USSR Union of Writers was trying to bring back the 
journal ZNAMYA which had left it and been set afloat. At that 
time Fedotov was representing the Ministry of the Press, which 
"criminally" registered the free journal and therefore was a 
codefendant in the case. At that time he was already deputy 
minister of the press. Somewhat later he became the director of 
RAIS (Russian Intellectual Property Agency) which had been 
formed out of the infamous VAAP [All-Russian Copyright Agency] 
of the KGB. And then he became the minister of the press of 
Russia. 
  Everyone recalls the president's Edict No. 1400. But 
few know that by Edict No. 1403 the former press minister 
Mikhail Fedotov was appointed Russia's ambassador to UNESCO. 
  Our special correspondent Yuliya Rakhayeva speaks with 
him. 
  [Rakhayeva] Mikhail Aleksandrovich, whose brilliant mind 
came 
up with the idea of making you Russia's ambassador to UNESCO and 
did you immediately have a positive response to this? 
  [Fedotov] As far as I know, this decision was suggested by 
the president himself--in any case I found out about it from 
him. I agreed at once--in the first place, I am not accustomed 
to arguing with the president; I have made it a rule: If I am 
working on the president's team, I will not argue with him. And 
in the second place, I understood that I could be useful here. 
And, finally, I wanted to get back to the work from which I was 
taken away after a half year. I worked in RAIS [Russian 
Intellectual Property Agency] for a half year and was pulled up 
like a turnip, after which I worked for a half year at the press 
ministry--and again I was transferred. I came here with the 
attitude that I would take it seriously and stay for a long 
time. In Moscow I was advised not to take it too seriously: They 
said UNESCO is a large, complicated organization, no matter what 
you do you will not figure it out, and therefore you should look 
at this as.... 
  [Rakhayeva] Honorable exile? 
  [Fedotov] More of a pleasant pastime. Well, even if it is an 
honorable exile--it is v-very honorable because of its high 
rank. But pleasant inactivity was not for me. There are machines 
created for entertainment and there are those that are created 
for work. And I am a machine created for work. 
  [Rakhayeva] The same workaholic, laboraholic of the kind 
that 
seemed to have completely disappeared from Russia. 
  [Fedotov] They are still around, I know quite a few people 
like that. My work day here ends at 0200 in the morning: I have 
to handle an immense quantity of business which has accumulated 
here, the collective of the permanent mission is not large, and 
UNESCO is indeed an immense organization and it takes a great 
deal of time and effort to go into all the details and try to 
find some new approaches of my own. Moreover, I am working on 
improving my English. As one UN bureaucrat told me, a very 
interesting result obtains when the position of ambassador is 
occupied not by a person from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
but by a nomenklatura appointee and not by a specialist in the 
area of foreign policy but a person with completely different 
baggage of knowledge, experience, and habits. 
  [Rakhayeva] But you, I think, have always been a person with 
different baggage, different from that of your predecessors. In 
brief, you have always been a rare bird.... 
  [Fedotov] True. And I am convinced that rare birds must join 
together in flocks and grow sturdy beaks and strong talons. 
  I came to work, and it was with a fresh view since I am a 
neophyte, a nonprofessional. Incidentally, I am not yet the 
ambassador but a permanent representative and no diplomatic rank 
has been conferred on me yet. I cannot say that this offends my 
pride in any way, but in UNESCO everything has significance, the 
more so since all my colleagues, the representatives of other 
countries, have the rank of ambassador. 
  [Rakhayeva] How do you explain this? 
  [Fedotov] Apparently I must first gain experience. Rank used 
to be conferred on political appointees immediately. 
  [Rakhayeva] Well, yes, they accumulated experience before 
that, in party or other similar work. 
  [Fedotov] And since I did not have that experience and times 
have changed as well, apparently I will have to wait. But that 
is all trivial. The fact is that I actually did come with 
certain ideas which had originated previously. 
  [Rakhayeva] Prior to when you were offered this post? 
  [Fedotov] Of course, it is simply that the same ideas may be 
realized by different means. And, for example, on the first day 
when I handed the general director of UNESCO my credentials, I 
expressed certain proposals in my greeting speech. One of the 
things I proposed was to consider the question of having the 
world community in 1997 celebrate the 500th anniversary of the 
code of law of Ivan III--the first all-Russian legal document. 
  [Rakhayeva] So do questions of law fall under UNESCO's 
jurisdiction as well? 
  [Fedotov] Well, in the first place, UNESCO as an 
intergovernmental organization of the UN system is entirely 
constructed on international law. Plus regulation of activity in 
the sphere of education, science, and culture, plus copyright 
law, protection of cultural assets under conditions of armed 
conflicts, restitution for cultural assets.... 
  [Rakhayeva] Yes, that is perhaps the most painful issue now. 
  [Fedotov] It is very painful, but there are also many 
others. 
Thus I suggested wording the question of the code of laws of 
Ivan III like this: "The 500th anniversary of the all-Russian 
rule-of-law statehood." 
  [Rakhayeva] Perhaps it would be more correct to say "attempt 
at rule-of-law statehood"? Did it really exist de facto in any 
stage of Russian statehood? 
  [Fedotov] When we celebrate a certain date we usually assume 
that there have been many ebbs and flows between it and the 
present day, which is natural. But as distinct from America, we 
have the possibility of counting all-Russian rule-of-law 
statehood almost back to the end of the 15th century. Of course, 
there are peoples with even more ancient legal canons. 
  [Rakhayeva] And with more durable ones that have become 
stronger with time since they were not always being uprooted 
like a turnip.... 
  [Fedotov] It seems to me that if this action goes as it 
should, it will serve as a reinforcement for today's Russian 
rule-of-law statehood. We will be able to look at our own roots, 
at our own history. And see that many of our laws that existed 
before 1917 have a right to be called some of the best in 
Europe. But we have gotten way off the subject! 
  [Rakhayeva] And all because Russia's ambassador to UNESCO 
became a doctor of legal sciences. 
  [Fedotov] Well, UNESCO got lucky with lawyers. For example, 
from 1965 through 1971 the ambassador to UNESCO was Professor of 
International Law Sobakin. But that was during the Cold War 
period; it was a completely different organization and, 
naturally, a completely different Russian government. The Soviet 
Union participated actively in the politicization of UNESCO. Now 
it is Russia that is exerting all efforts to contribute to 
further depoliticization. Because UNESCO's objective is the 
intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind. 
  [Rakhayeva] Solidarity in spite of what separates us? In 
spite of our economic and political differences? 
  [Fedotov] The intellectual solidarity of all countries that 
are members of UNESCO in resolving global problems, for example, 
in genetic engineering--protection of the human genome. There 
are questions of molecular biology, study of the ocean, and so 
forth, with the exception of health protection, which is handled 
by the WHO [World Health Organization], and questions of 
electronic communications, which are handled by the 
International Telecommunications Union. The spheres of science, 
culture, education, and communications--these are our four 
pillars. Naturally, all these spheres require legal regulation, 
which is provided by two kinds of documents: conventions and 
recommendations. The convention is the stricter document, it 
must be followed. For example, the Universal Copyright 
Convention, which we joined in 1973. Or the convention on 
wetlands. There is a whole list of them. And they are mandatory 
for all who have signed them. And there are the recommendations, 
"On Legal Protection of the Translator's Rights," "On Protection 
of the Natural and Cultural Legacy on the National Plane," and 
so forth. They are not mandatory but only recommendations, but 
still they are coordinated with all so that nobody will be 
against them. I suggested to UNESCO General Director Federico 
Mayor the idea of model laws. I did not conceive it, but I am 
trying to introduce it into UNESCO. This is the scholarly vision 
of a law--the way scholars imagine it, on the basis of 
experience accumulated by legislation of the most diverse 
countries. The first stage is the study of legislation, the 
second--synthesis and analysis and, finally, the 
third--development of a unified text. 
  [Rakhayeva] That is, reducing the legislation of various 
countries to a common denominator? 
  [Fedotov] Yes, standardization is what it is. 
  [Rakhayeva] But in what areas can such a thing be allowed so 
that it does not look like intervention in internal affairs? 
  [Fedotov] In no case will it be intervention in internal 
affairs. UNESCO is a bee that flies to various countries and 
gathers pollen and then, here in Paris, it produces honey which 
feeds all countries that are UNESCO members. It is very 
important that the model law not be mandatory for any state. But 
any state that has decided to adopt, for example, a law on 
culture or on education or on the press or on archives or on 
protection of the human genome from all experiments conducted 
today in the area of genetic engineering, regardless of whether 
it is a large state with legal traditions or a small one that is 
just developing--they can come to UNESCO and take the text of 
the model law. 
  [Rakhayeva] That is, the task of the legislators from 
various 
countries becomes extremely simplified: While previously it was 
necessary for them to come up with their own laws in the 
necessary area, frequently quite contradictory ones, now they 
are offered a prepared model on a silver platter. 
  [Fedotov] Take for example the laws on the press that are in 
effect in the majority of CIS countries today. All of them were 
created on the basis of the Russian law. That is, the Union, and 
then Russian law. But since they were all written by the same 
people.... 
  [Rakhayeva] And we know who these people are: Baturin, 
Fedotov, Entin. 
  [Fedotov] Where did the similarity of laws come from? What 
did we do, impose our law on the legislators of the CIS 
countries? Nothing of the kind! It is simply that they took the 
model which was, in the first place, available, in the second 
place, comprehensible, and, in the third place, the one that 
would fit fairly smoothly into their legal system. The same 
thing is happening today with copyright legislation. If a law is 
good, why not take it as a model? But if Russia itself were to 
send out its laws--that would be intervention. And then out of a 
sense of contradictoriness there can arise the question: Why 
Russian, maybe Chinese is better? The model UNESCO law should 
synthesize all the best that exists in the Russian, Chinese, 
Turkish, American, and so forth--and we will obtain the 
quintessence of world experience. 
  [Rakhayeva] The problem of the older and younger brother 
will 
disappear. 
  [Fedotov] It is simply that the older brother will be all of 
humanity. There are very many spheres for application of the 
model laws. The next day after a meeting with UNESCO General 
Director Federico Mayor when I shared my ideas, he convened the 
board of directors and said: You call me too much of an optimist 
with regard to Russia, but it turns out that I was not enough of 
an optimist. In the first place, Russia has made its regular 
payment on its debts to the UNESCO budget and, in the second 
place, the Russian ambassador has given me three wonderful ideas. 
  [Rakhayeva] One of them was the model laws, and the other 
two? 
  [Fedotov] Let me emphasize once again that it was not I who 
thought of the model laws--they already exist in the UN system. 
For example, there is the model criminal code, in whose 
development our scholars participated immensely. The second idea 
is linked to questions of copyright. Since two organizations 
work with them within the framework of the UN system--UNESCO and 
WIPO [World Intellectual Property Organization]--I suggested to 
Mayor that we determine spheres of interaction so that there 
will be no unnecessary duplication. We must find our angle. 
First of all it includes collective measures for combating 
piracy. 
  [Rakhayeva] Familiar ideas of the former RAIS director.... 
  [Fedotov] I presented them at the 27th session of the 
general 
conference of UNESCO and received support from a number of 
delegations--German, Spanish, French, Lithuanian, and many 
others. What does combating piracy mean to us? As of today, 
publishing piracy and audio and film piracy have reached quite 
fantastic proportions. 
  [Rakhayeva] It is what they call in the criminal world 
"unbridled behavior." 
  [Fedotov] Piracy is directly related to tax evasion. 
According to my figures, the piracy business in Russia has a 
turnover of about $10 billion, including operations involving 
computer programs. But, does our state not need this money? I 
think we must join forces with other countries--after all, it is 
impossible to fight piracy separately in Russia alone! 
  [Rakhayeva] No, why not? After all, we can drop the "Iron 
Curtain" again and solve all our problems at once! 
  [Fedotov] Except for one--that would mean death to Russia. 
And it is precisely collective measures for fighting piracy that 
could bring significant investments to Russia and open up the 
treasure house of world culture to it. Because as of today we 
can either obtain them for very large amounts of money or steal 
them. And since we do not have large amounts of money, the 
question is even simpler: They are either stolen or bought on 
the cheap. 
  [Rakhayeva] Or there are certain philanthropic, individual, 
discrete actions.... 
  [Fedotov] Within the framework of the collective fight 
against piracy we want to implement the project "cultural 
credit." After creating under the aegis of UNESCO a 
philanthropic organization that will offer users in Russia 
(cable television networks, video salons, and so forth), for 
example, video films at subsidized prices and licenses for them. 
I hope to make it clear to Western copyright holders that it is 
better to get a dollar than to get nothing. 
  [Rakhayeva] But it will probably be necessary to explain to 
the Russian entrepreneur as well that it is better to pay this 
dollar than to put your entire enterprise at risk. 
  [Fedotov] Unfortunately this risk is not very great today: 
The law exists but not the practice. 
  [Rakhayeva] Everything seems to be clear about the second 
idea. And your third idea? 
  [Fedotov] When I first arrived here I asked my coworkers if 
there were a document according to which the money of private 
individuals and organizations that materially support UNESCO 
projects was exempt from taxes. I was told that there was not; 
somehow nobody had ever thought of it. But, after all, any 
philanthropic fund stays alive precisely because of this! It was 
more difficult to push this idea through but I, a neophyte, was 
helped by workers of the permanent mission, among whom there are 
remarkable professionals. I will be sorry if these people are 
called back after their period of residence is over. 
  [Rakhayeva] You speak of this as though you had no say in 
it: 
God giveth and God taketh away. 
  [Fedotov] I cannot say that absolutely nothing depends on 
me, 
but a great deal still depends on the leadership of the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. Thus we prepared and sent through the 
general conference a resolution which appealed to UNESCO members 
to take measures within the limits of their authority to 
encourage nongovernmental organizations and private individuals 
that finance UNESCO projects. I immediately informed the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia of this and prepared the 
corresponding draft of a presidential edict. In a discussion 
with Federico Mayor I said that it would be good if, following 
Russia, similar laws were adopted by other countries, and he 
answered that everything possible would be done to turn this 
snowflake into an immense snowball (incidentally, Mr. Mayor was 
recently awarded the Russian Order of Friendship of Peoples). 
And this would mean that throughout the world we could collect 
considerably more money for financing UNESCO projects. There is 
very little money now, UNESCO is a poor organization. 
  [Rakhayeva] Especially after the United States withdrew with 
such pomp. 
  [Fedotov] In the United States as well as in Great Britain 
now more and more people are advising in favor of returning. And 
with them a large amount of money will return as well. It is 
important to use this money wisely and not to support 
international bureaucrats. There are problems that affect 
absolutely everyone, for example, ecology. Here it is not enough 
to act separately; after all, everything in nature is 
interconnected. And do you know that UNESCO has declared 1995 a 
year of tolerance? The official Russian translation is the year 
of patience, which I object to. They tell me that tolerance is 
incomprehensible. I suggest that we should explain it. Tolerance 
is breaking away from fundamentalism. Any kind--religious, 
party, ethnic. And the acceptance of various viewpoints. Closer 
to this is the term "ecumenism." Within the framework of the 
year of tolerance there is the hope of organizing in Moscow a 
mega-concert of the remarkable French composer and musician 
Jean-Michel Jarre, who is a goodwill ambassador to UNESCO. Of 
course this entails immense difficulties because his concerts 
attract not thousands but sometimes millions of people. These 
are concerts of the streets and squares. The most interesting 
thing is that at Jean-Michel Jarre's concerts there are never 
any excesses, as distinct from the concerts of the majority of 
rock and pop musicians. His music calms you down, it is 
tolerant. And this is simply necessary in Russia now. 
  [Rakhayeva] Yes, even more than at any other time.... 
  [Fedotov] Another idea that is linked to the year of 
tolerance is the Star of Tolerance. 
  [Rakhayeva] This is apparently a title that will be 
conferred 
on a person with particular qualities. 
  [Fedotov] Not at all. It is a satellite that will be 
launched 
into lower orbit in the form of two hollow spheres made of 
light-reflecting material. And one will rotate around the other. 
They have to be large enough and at the same time light. They 
will be easy to see from various points. Imagine a young man 
strolling with his girlfriend and above them in the sky is the 
Star of Tolerance! And there will be two spheres--because there 
are two different viewpoints--two positions. And their 
unification symbolizes the idea of tolerance. 
  [Rakhayeva] Only, perhaps, not unification but peaceful 
coexistence? 
  [Fedotov] Perhaps you are right. Installed in one of these 
satellites will be a radio transmitter which sends signals to 
earth. It will be possible to receive them even with the tiniest 
of receivers installed in a badge, a pendant, or an earring, 
which will flicker to the tempo of some melody. 
  [Rakhayeva] Fantasy! 
  [Fedotov] And that is still not all. Using this radio 
transmitter it will be possible to control the lighting of 
cultural facilities. To this one might say: The rich, they say, 
have their own quirks. But for Russia this is a very important 
product because we can launch a satellite, using one of the 
missiles to be destroyed. Instead of being cut up into scrap 
metal the missile will be launched with the Star of Tolerance! 
This, of course, will require negotiations with the United 
States, since this possibility was not envisioned by the 
agreement on the reduction of nuclear weapons. I hope they will 
understand. Because this is good and beautiful. And when each 
person sees the badge on another person, he will understand that 
that person is an advocate of tolerance, patience for other 
viewpoints. These are the kinds of big ideas and projects we 
have. But there is also an immense number of small projects. For 
example, the creation in Nizhniy Novgorod under the aegis of 
UNESCO of a school that combines secondary education with 
farming skills. 
  [Rakhayeva] And what stage is that project in now? 
  [Fedotov] It is being developed and documentation is being 
prepared. There is a plan for the reconstruction of the Bolshoy 
Theater. 
  [Rakhayeva] And is it too much to repair the large hall of 
the conservatory? 
  [Fedotov] For now it is, but the Bolshoy Theater, the 
Russian 
State Library, the former Lenin Library, and the 
Hermitage--these are what UNESCO has taken on. There are many 
projects related to science. For example, the Moscow Engineering 
University under UNESCO's aegis, the creation of faculties and 
schools. 
  [Rakhayeva] Mikhail Aleksandrovich, did I understand you 
correctly when you said that you came to UNESCO not to do good 
for humankind as a whole but in order to do at least something 
for Russia? 
  [Fedotov] That is a rhetorical question. I came so that 
cooperation with UNESCO would bring greater advantage to Russia. 
And if it is good for Russia, it will be good for humankind as 
well. 
  [Rakhayeva] But is there any guarantee that by making 
contributions Russia will receive even an equal amount in 
return? Crudely: yes or no? 
  [Fedotov] In financial terms? Of course there is no such 
guarantee. For example, Russia contributes much more to the UN 
than to UNESCO. And what does it receive besides the opportunity 
to participate in the peacemaking forces? But this is how we 
participate in improving the world order. Through UNESCO we 
achieve concrete goals in the sphere of global humanitarian 
problems. True, UNESCO does not have the money required, for 
example, to reconstruct the Bolshoy Theater, but there is a 
possibility of attracting the necessary funds. 
  [Rakhayeva] Tell me, please, about the mechanism for 
attracting funds--this is not done through personal contacts. 
  [Fedotov] Well, why not, it is done through personal 
contacts 
also. But UNESCO has its own permanent contacts. The 
organization enlists high-class specialists, conducts expert 
appraisals, and renders intellectual assistance. And if the idea 
of exemption from taxes goes through it will be even simpler to 
attract money. I have already compared UNESCO with a bee. Once 
again: If the UN is the reason and power of our planet, UNESCO 
is its soul and conscience, and also its intellect--scientific, 
cultural, and ideological. 
  [Rakhayeva] And UNESCO is helping to acquire this intellect? 
  [Fedotov] Rather, to concentrate and improve it. UNESCO has 
a 
multitude of projects in this area. Large ones and some that are 
not so large. For example, financing a journal such as 
INOSTRANNAYA LITERATURA. And this, as you understand, is not 
all. The Russian Academy of Sciences received $300,000 for 
subscribing to scientific journals and trainees from the former 
Lenin Library are being sent for training to France, Germany, 
and Great Britain at UNESCO's expense. And so forth. So if you 
put it all together, this covers the sum of member 
contributions. The more so since so far Russia is in debt $60 
million. We are gradually paying it off; I do not think that 
Russia has the right to be a debtor. 
  [Rakhayeva] As a great power--and also as a country where 
today everything is one big unexpected event. 
  [Fedotov] It is simply necessary to be able to collect 
money. 
I think we have an absolutely incorrect tax policy; we must 
lower taxes and stiffen liability for paying them. 
  [Rakhayeva] And is it true that the television program 
"Russian Universities" comes out under the aegis of UNESCO? 
  [Fedotov] It does and it will continue to. I hope very much 
that whatever changes may take place with television Channel 4, 
this program will remain. Because it means access to culture, 
science, education, and the spiritual world. And if all we do is 
advertise "sneakers" we will lose this and everything else as 
well.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Vondra, first deputy minister of </F>
foreign affairs of the Czech Republic, by unidentified OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA correspondent; place and date not given: "Into NATO--for 
the Defense of Democracy"] 
  [Text] Working consultations with diplomats of 
certain European states, the Czech Republic included, have been 
held in Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Czech Republic 
delegation was headed by Aleksandr Vondra, first deputy minister 
of foreign affairs. Formerly a dissident, after 1989 he became 
an assistant to Vaclav Havel for foreign policy and subsequently 
a professional diplomat. Aleksandr Vondra answers OBSHCHAYA 
GAZETA's questions. 
  [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] The Czech Republic is energetically 
seeking membership of NATO. Is this not dictated by a fear that 
some time ahead, in several years, say, Russia might extend its 
imperial ambitions to the Czech Republic? 
  [Vondra] The debate in the Czech Republic about NATO 
membership is not dictated primarily by fear. We have other 
motives, and they are connected with our understanding of what 
the North Atlantic alliance represents. It was never perceived 
as a hostile force in my country. Many people saw it as a 
community defending Western liberties against communism, others 
saw the opposed military blocs as two mighty fortresses, between 
which we were situated. 
  Read the Washington Treaty of 1949, and you will see that it 
says nothing about enemies. It says that the states subscribing 
to the treaty undertake to guard democracy, Western values, 
liberty, and the constitutional state. We are a small state, for 
which remaining neutral and providing for our defenses on our 
own are difficult. The best means of the defense of democracy 
for us is membership in a system of collective defense. The sole 
effective instrument of such defense today is NATO, which for 50 
years not only guarded Western liberty and democracy against 
communism but has maintained also a certain internal order in 
Europe itself. We, as a country situated right at the center of 
Europe and cleaving to Western values, are interested in joining 
the North Atlantic alliance. This is our main mission, and here 
our position differs somewhat from that of other countries, 
perhaps. 
  [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Should we understand you to mean that 
membership of NATO would symbolize the Czech Republic's return 
to a Europe of which it had always been a part? 
  [Vondra] For us this is a final return to a world to which 
we 
have historically belonged. But this step is not simply a 
symbol. In joining a system of collective security we would like 
simultaneously to insure ourselves against any extreme 
contingency. 
  [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Could the Partnership for Peace--if only 
partially--afford you the guarantees you seek? As we all know, 
when signing the agreement with Ukraine, Bill Clinton promised 
it some guarantees, not more closely defined.... 
  [Vondra] Clearly, the guarantees promised Ukraine are not 
the 
same guarantees of security that NATO members possess. In my 
view, it was confirmed in Ukraine's case that it is an 
independent state, not some temporary formation, as some 
politicians would like. Even though Ukraine does not have a 
strong historical tradition of national statehood, it should be 
respected. That is, I would say that the guarantees to Ukraine 
are primarily guarantees of political will. 
  As far as the Partnership for Peace is concerned, we have 
been promised nothing, merely offered cooperation with NATO on 
an individual basis. And we believe that final membership of the 
North Atlantic alliance would complete the process, which will 
take some time. We are prepared to invest resources to ensure 
that this process culminate in the establishment of the fullest 
mutual trust and the Czech Republic's official membership of the 
alliance. Guarantees of the assurance of our national security 
would thereby be placed on the table at the same time also. 
  [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] And does not the aspiration to such 
guarantees betray, nonetheless, a fear in the face of the 
development of events in Russia? 
  [Vondra] No. I believe, moreover, that a unique opportunity 
connected with the fact that the present-day Czech Republic is 
not the former Czechoslovakia is, in a sense, opening up before 
us. However paradoxical, we are now after all situated "further 
away" from Russia: We are separated by two whole 
states--Slovakia and Ukraine. Now we need not, as previously, be 
so afraid, and this could contribute to the greater balance of 
Czech-Russian relations. Now we can look at Russia more 
rationally, without the previous emotions, and cooperate. This 
is a new challenge demanding a response from both parties.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hans-Dietrich Genscher by A. Udaltsov, chief </F>
editor of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, and V. Zapevalov, correspondent 
of LITERATURNAYA GAZETA in Bonn; place and date not given: "I 
Believe in the Strength of Russian Democracy"] 
  [Text] Bonn--Hans-Dietrich Genscher (b. 1927) is the 
"world champion" foreign minister. He spent 18 years in this 
difficult office. The cardinal changes in East Europe over the 
past five years are linked with his name. He retired voluntarily 
on 17 May 1992 at the height of his political fame. He is 
honorary chairman of the Free Democratic Party of the FRG. As 
before, he is among the most, if not the most, popular 
politician in Germany. He rarely gives interviews, but he 
responded to LITERATURNAYA GAZETA's request immediately. We met 
with Genscher in his relatively modest member's office in the 
Bundestag. Let us say plainly that in conversation "off the 
record," he spouted jokes, made decisive statements, and was 
candid. When, however, the conversation was being "taped" for 
the press, we were faced with a "crafty fox," as journalists 
rightly call him. But with a close reading of the answers to 
LITERATURNAYA GAZETA's questions, the reader will, it seems to 
us, find much material for the most diverse reflection, 
assessments, and conclusions. 
  [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Herr Genscher, we know you as a most 
prominent politician of Germany and top foreign policy 
specialist. We know how much you have dealt with problems of the 
USSR and Russia. We would like today, therefore, to concentrate 
on one topic: "Russia from April 1985 through the present 
through the eyes of Herr Genscher." 
  Let us start at the very beginning: Under what circumstances 
did you get to know Mikhail Gorbachev, what impression did he 
make on you at that time, and what, afterward, and how might you 
evaluate him today? 
  [Genscher] I made the acquaintance of Mr. Gorbachev in 1986, 
during a visit to Moscow. He made an unforgettable impression on 
me. I was taken primarily with his call for new thinking. He 
seemed a self-assured and quite complex conversational partner. 
But he was prepared to hear another opinion also and to seek 
mutual understanding on contentious issues. His policy led to 
the surmounting of East-West contradictions and afforded an 
opportunity for the unity of all of Europe. For us Germans this 
meant unity for our people also. His policy of elimination of 
the East-West confrontation and the fundamental changes in the 
former Soviet Union are of historic dimensions. 
  [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] The same question concerns Boris 
Yeltsin. Could you venture a comparison of these two politicians? 
  [Genscher] Comparing these two outstanding personalities 
would be unfair to both of them. Boris Yeltsin supports a 
continuation of East-West cooperation, as was emphasized anew 
recently during the meeting with President Clinton. Even today 
he has done much for the process of democratization and reforms 
in Russia. 
  [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] The first free parliamentary elections 
in Russia did not produce the results anticipated by Russia's 
democrats or by the democrats of Europe, either. In addition, we 
obtained the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon." What, in your opinion, 
were the decisive mistakes of the democrats which made possible 
such an election outcome? 
  [Genscher] We had hoped for a more favorable result for the 
democrats in Russia, of course. The question arises, however: 
Was this possible? After all, in the course of the relatively 
short space of time that democratization has had, all the 
problems of the past and the transitional period have become 
apparent, but there has not as yet been successful reform. I 
believe in the strength of democracy in Russia and in the will 
of the great Russian people, who by their culture and historic 
achievements have made such a great contribution to the 
formation of Europe's future. There is nothing surprising in the 
fact that at a time of revolutionary changes and ideological 
retreat on the question of national self-determination, there 
has been a stimulation of the activity of nationalist 
politicians. This does not confirm the soundness of their ideas 
but, on the contrary, requires even greater explanatory work to 
show their danger. 
  [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Herr Genscher, you contributed to this 
extent or the other to the fall of the communist regimes in 
Eastern Europe and, subsequently, in the republics of the former 
USSR. A multitude of armed conflicts has arisen in the world, 
and much blood has been spilled and continues to be spilled in 
the wake of this. Have you no regrets? Do you believe it might 
have been possible to move toward democracy by other routes, or 
are the conflicts and blood inevitable? 
  [Genscher] A great achievement of the peoples of the former 
Soviet Union is the fact that the path from socialism to 
democracy, the path from centralism in the USSR to the 
independence of the republics, happened [as published] without 
war or the use of force. The present military conflicts and 
bloodshed are not a consequence of the transition to democracy. 
The principle contained in the Helsinki Final Act, namely, that 
all contentious issues should be settled by political means, is 
being forgotten. This needs to be remembered, remembered by 
everyone in Europe, what is more. At the end of the 20th century 
no one should any longer be expatiating on the inevitability of 
conflicts but speaking of the necessity for the peaceful 
settlement and surmounting of conflicts. 
  [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Western assistance. Much is being said 
about this, but the average Russian has not perceived it as yet. 
Whence the allergy to these words. And the well-known Czech 
politician Mlynar even counseled in our paper against Western 
capital being admitted to Russia. What can you say on this score? 
  [Genscher] As far as Western assistance is concerned, 
Germany 
has made a substantial contribution, greater, generally, than 
all the other Western countries put together. This is in keeping 
with our strong friendly relations with the Russian people and 
other peoples of the former USSR. That this capital has not had 
the consequences for the ordinary citizens that we had imagined 
has been the result of the above-mentioned complex problems of 
the transitional period. At the same time, on the other hand, no 
country can manage without foreign capital, be they the 
Americans, the Germans, the French, the British, or the 
Russians. The transfer of capital signifies simultaneously 
financial and economic cooperation and thus a growing interweave 
of interests. 
  [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] A couple of questions about foreign 
policy. Do you also, like certain politicians in the FRG, 
observe imperialist ambitions or trends toward them in Russian 
foreign policy? How is the concept of a "country's national 
interests" defined? 
  [Genscher] Of course, each people must themselves define the 
"national interests" concept. But these interests suffer if they 
are detrimental to the interests of other countries. Such is the 
philosophy of our cooperation in the European Union. This is the 
philosophy of the Helsinki Final Act and the Paris Charter, and 
this should be the philosophy of the building of the 
architecture for all of Europe, to which for me all the 
successors of the former Soviet Union, Russia included, 
naturally, pertain. 
  [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] You were a most impassioned supporter 
of a security system that affords equal prospects for all 
countries. Do the recent NATO decisions correspond to this? If 
so, why are the East European and Baltic countries not entirely 
satisfied with the results of the summit in Brussels? 
  [Genscher] I remain a convinced supporter of a policy that 
affords all countries in Europe equal prospects. It was for this 
reason that two and a half years ago I supported together with 
then Secretary of State Baker the creation of the NATO 
Cooperation Council and an area of stabilization from Vancouver 
to Vladivostok. For this same reason I have always advocated 
increasingly close relations among the European Community, the 
countries of Central and Southeast Europe, and the successors of 
the former Soviet Union. It is essential to see all the 
prospects of cooperation, not just the military prospects. The 
results of the NATO summit correspond to these requirements. 
This means simultaneously an increase in the role of the 
European Union in all-European responsibility also. My 
impression is that the Central and East European countries and 
the Baltic states are recognizing increasingly what 
opportunities this concept affords. 
  [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Might Russia become a member of NATO 
in 
the future, what are the conditions for this? 
  [Genscher] There are for Russia no prerequisites other than 
those that face the other members of the NATO Cooperation 
Council. But Russia occupies a special place even now, 
maintaining a strategic partnership with the United States. I 
see this partnership as an expression of the joint 
responsibility of the two nuclear powers. 
  [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Reproaches have been heard in Bonn and 
even more loudly in Moscow that Russia and Germany lack a 
concept for a joint future and that our relations are in a 
stagnation phase. 
  [Genscher] I cannot share this reproach, inasmuch as there 
are between Russia and Germany an important joint statement and 
documents that take account of the special relationship between 
our countries. This particular feature is based on historical 
roots. Even the horrifying World War II could not erase from the 
memory the historical, cultural, and human relations between 
Germans and Russians. This particular feature is being expressed 
today also in the fact that the Germans and Russians want to 
achieve mutual understanding not behind the backs and not to the 
detriment of other countries. Whoever is in a position correctly 
to evaluate German-Polish and German-Czech relations will see 
that our immediate neighbors in the East have no grounds for 
apprehension. And as for everything else, no one should worry on 
account of the German-Russian partnership. At the same time 
close German-Russian relations are a contribution to stability 
in Europe. The new culture of joint existence demands observance 
of equality and an equal degree of security for all countries in 
Europe, for small countries to no less an extent than for larger 
countries. The relations of these countries imply participation 
in the building of the all-European infrastructure, which 
includes all Central and Southeast European countries and all 
successors of the USSR. A joint system of transport, 
telecommunications, energy--these are major investments for the 
future which will link in Europe the creative powers of our 
peoples and our economic potentials. 
  [Udaltsov, Zapevalov] Germany has embarked on a particularly 
active political year. You have declined to be a candidate for 
the office of federal president. German astrologers predicted on 
the threshold of 1994 that you would retire from active politics 
altogether this year. This is hard to believe. What are your 
personal plans and goals for the year of 1994? 
  [Genscher] My goal is to contribute to big successes for my 
party in 1994. This implies an active, not passive, approach.

<F P=106> [Survey compiled by Sergei Strokan: "Russia, USA: Way to </F>
Businesslike Partnership"; Survey of trade and economic 
relations between the two countries] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  State of affairs </H5>
  During 11 months of 1993 trade turnover between Russia and 
the USA comprised 2,426 million dollars, including Russia's 
export--1,007.2 million, and import--1,418.8 million. 
  In the structure of export to the USA the main commodity 
groups consist of precious metals and articles from these 
metals, rare earth and nonferrous metals, chemical goods, oil 
products, foodstuffs and agricultural raw materials. 
  Import is mainly represented by food products (wheat, maize, 
barley, butter, soy beans, etc.), machines, equipment and 
transport facilities. 
  Russian-American trade is traditionally characterized by a 
considerable deficit of the balance of trade. In 1992, for 
instance, import exceeded export 4.2 times. The volume and 
structure of Russia's export, especially that of finished 
articles, has been adversely affected by the long absence (from 
1951 to 1992) of the most-favoured-nation treatment. For a whole 
number of goods likely to be exported the duties imposed on us 
were two to ten times higher than the level of customs duties 
for countries enjoying this treatment. Among other reasons 
mention can be made of low competitive capacity, the barriers 
kept alive in the USA for the import into the country of 
high-technology goods, and antidumping legislation. As a result, 
the possibilities of exporting uranium products to the USA were 
considerably limited in the past, and an antidumping duty was 
imposed on ferrosilicium from Russia. Until recently there has 
been a threat of antidumping proceedings being instituted in 
relation to the sale of chlorinated potassium, aluminium and 
steel. 
  As in the past, last year goods turnover was mainly 
determined by our import of grain. A favourable balance of trade 
in the first half-year arose partly in virtue of the fact that 
due to the unsettled problem of debt Russia could still not use 
credits for the purchase of grain. However, four new agreements 
were concluded in June in the framework of the Food for Progress 
programme, shipments of which commenced in September. In this 
way Russia's import in October exceeded export, the latter 
growing at a higher rate than in 1992. 
<H5>  Treaty rights and legal status </H5>
  The key document is the Agreement on Trade on Trade 
Relations 
signed between the USSR and the USA in 1990. In relation to 
Russia it was put in force on June 17, 1992, during the summit 
meeting in Washington. 
  The document makes provision for measures aimed at 
encouraging commercial contacts and boosting the mutual 
deliveries of goods and services, and assists in expanding trade 
in equipment and technologies. The agreement regulates the 
financial aspect of trade between the two countries, the 
questions of protecting intellectual property, and formalizes 
cooperation in the spheres of statistics and standards. 
Provision is made for facilitating the transit of goods across 
the territories of our countries. Agreements have been reached 
on measures for the eventuality of the "market being violated" 
(damage being inflicted on national industry by import), and on 
the settlement of disputes through arbitration. 
  In June 1992 there was an exchange of notes on giving effect 
to the Agreement on Assisting Investments signed on April 3, 
1992. It envisages the possibility for American investors to use 
the services of the U.S. Government's specialized insurance 
agency known at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation 
(OPIC). 
  The Treaty on the Encouragement and Mutual Protection of 
Investments (not yet ratified by the Russian side) and the 
Treaty on Avoiding Dual Taxation (the exchange of ratification 
instruments took place in December 1993) have also been signed 
with a view to attracting investments. 
<H5>  Organizational basis </H5>
  In previous decades the Joint Soviet-American Commission on 
Trade (in 1980-1985 its activities were unilaterally frozen by 
the USA in connection with the war in Afghanistan) had a 
considerable part to play in promoting economic contacts. 
  In 1992, on the American side's initiative, the US-Russian 
Business Council was instituted in Washington as a lobbyist 
organization speaking for the interests of the U.S. business 
circles. On the part of the CIS there is the Council for Trade 
Cooperation Between the Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the CIS 
and the USA. 
  An Intergovernmental Russian-American Committee for the 
Development of Business Cooperation was instituted in 1992 for 
the purpose of promoting cooperation in the economy at a 
governmental level. 
  Last April, at the summit meeting in Vancouver, it was 
decided to set up an Intergovernmental Commission on Economic 
and Technological Cooperation. The range of its interests 
comprises joint activities in areas such as science, energy, 
space, conversion and environmental protection. The commission 
has held two sittings: in Washington (September) and in Moscow 
(December). It is headed by the Chairman of the RF Government 
and the Vice-President of the USA. 
<H5>  Trade and political situation </H5>
  In the late 1980s, after a partial embargo on the export of 
agricultural products to the USSR, the US administration took a 
number of positive steps. Since 1987 the United States had been 
granting us subsidies for the purchase of wheat. 
  In April 1992 the US Congress eliminated one of the key 
obstacles to Russian-American trade and economic relations--the 
Byrd-Stevenson amendments fixing a ceiling of 300 million 
dollars on the total volume of credits to Russia on the part of 
the US Eximbank and 40 million on credits for energy projects. 
  As a result of the Agreement on Trade Relations Between the 
USSR and the USA being brought into force (June 1992) Russia has 
been granted the most-favoured-nation treatment in trade with 
the United States. Incidentally, contrary to the provisions of 
the Agreement's Article 1 on the unconditional provision of such 
treatment, the USA extended it on the basis of an annual 
waiver--temporary suspension of the Jackson-Vanik amendment 
(this suspension can be unilaterally cancelled at any moment). 
  The Act on Support for Freedom in Russia and Nascent 
Euro-Asian Democracies and Support for Open Markets, better 
known as the Freedom Support Act, came into force in October 
1992. It envisages the repeal of a number of legislative 
restrictions of the Cold War times, but does not affect Section 
IV of the 1974 US Trade Act (Jackson-Vanik amendment). 
  Thanks to the Vancouver accords between the two presidents 
two agreements were signed in June of last year on the free 
supplies of food products and two intergovernmental credit 
agreements under the Food for Progress programme. The total cost 
of supplies is 500 million dollars, including 71.5 million on an 
unrepayable basis. Another 200 million dollars will be used to 
compensate transport expenses. The term of the credit is 15 
years. The interest rate is 3 percent in the course of easy-term 
seven years and 4 percent in subsequent years. 
  In July 1993 a framework agreement was signed with the US 
Eximbank on the provision of credits and credit guarantees for 
the Russian oil and gas industry to the tune of more than two 
billion dollars. 
  Last August President Clinton signed a bill on the budget 
and 
taxation, which also speaks about the need to extend to Russia 
the benefits of the General System of Preferences. 
  In December 1993, on the administration's initiative, the US 
Congress passed a Law on Assisting the Reform in New Democratic 
Countries and on Rendering Aid and Support with a View to 
Improving Partnership with Russia, Ukraine and Other 
Newly-Independent States, whereby more than 70 legislative 
restrictions have been lifted. This number does not include the 
Jackson-Vanik amendment. 
<H5>  Prospects </H5>
  The creation of a treaty rights basis, the establishment of 
the most-favoured-nation treatment in trade between the two 
countries, the extension to Russia of the US General System of 
Preferences and, lastly, the new programmes of economic aid 
provide real prerequisites for increasing mutual trade. 
Cooperation in investments has a special part to play. US firms 
already take the lead among Western investors in the creation of 
joint ventures in Russia (as many as 1,400 JVs have been set up 
with their participation). American investments in our country 
total c.400 million dollars. More than 300 firms have opened 
their representation missions. 
  Work is also underway to implement a whole number of 
projects 
aimed at the creation of companies on US territory with the 
participation of Russian capital, including those on the basis 
of our advanced technology.

<F P=106> [Interview with Arkadiy Volskiy, president of the Russian </F>
Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, by Arkadiy 
Zhemchugov, DELOVOY MIR correspondent; place and date not given: 
"From Davos with Satisfaction and Bitterness"] 
  [Text] These, it would seem, mutually exclusive faint 
notes--satisfaction and bitterness--alternate in the expressions 
of Arkadiy Volskiy, president of the Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, who shared his impressions 
with Arkadiy Zhemchugov, a DELOVOY MIR columnist, about the 
World Economic Forum that was held in the Swiss health resort 
town of Davos. 
  "The Davos forum," said A. Volskiy, "which has been bringing 
leaders of the world of business and politics together for 
almost a quarter of a century already, presents broad 
opportunities for the establishment and development of both 
bilateral and multilateral business contacts. Moreover, besides 
Davos, meetings are held regularly in one or another country of 
the world. In May of this year, for example, such a meeting will 
be held in Moscow under the motto 'Business in Russia.' 
Approximately 400 representatives of the business world abroad 
have already expressed a readiness to come to the Moscow forum. 
  "We have been participating in the World Economic Forum for 
only a few years, starting in 1990, when the RUIE [Russian Union 
of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs] was empowered to represent 
the interests of our country in Davos. We have used this short 
period to establish business contacts with foreign 
entrepreneurial circles. Literally dozens of different contracts 
have been signed. 
  "This time our presence in Davos was not without results. On 
the whole, that which we were striving for was achieved at the 
negotiations that were held: a deep and professional discussion 
of the problems and difficulties of present-day Russia. The work 
of the forum, as is well known, was not limited to plenary 
meetings. I would say that it was conducted mainly in sections, 
or, as it is also put, in thematic seminars. And here I would 
especially like to note the effective work of two sections: 
banks and business. 
  "In the first of them, details were worked out and 
conditions 
were agreed to for financial transactions in today's Russia. In 
addition, the agreements achieved were formulated through 
conciliatory decisions. 
  "In the business section, practically every Russian 
entrepreneur came out with meaningful information about how to 
conduct business under present-day Russian conditions, what 
difficulties will be encountered, how to overcome them, etc. 
This brought results: Numerous transactions were outlined with a 
real promise of their being signed in the near future. The 
greatest interest was displayed by Indian and Japanese firms, 
although others also were not detached onlookers. 
  "It seems to me that a real return can also be expected from 
meetings with our former CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic 
Assistance] partners. Talks with the leaders of Bulgaria, 
Romania, Hungary, and Poland took place in a constructive and 
friendly spirit. The exchange of practical experience in the 
radical reform of political and socioeconomic structures will 
not occur without leaving a trace either for us or for them." 
  [Zhemchugov] In his speech at the plenary session of the 
Davos Forum, our prime minister announced Russia's readiness to 
create a multilateral council of foreign and Russian bankers, 
investors, and entrepreneurs for the specific study together 
with them of possible investment cooperation by industries and 
enterprises. Your comments... 
  [Volskiy] I will note right off that the initiative of our 
prime minister was met by broad support at the forum, first of 
all on the part of the European Bank of Reconstruction and 
Development and the IMF, which intend to send their 
representatives to Moscow, where this international organ is 
supposed to be established in May-June. Representatives of the 
large banks of Russia who were in Davos reacted just as 
positively to this. 
  But if we are talking about the essence of the matter, the 
initiative of Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin implies the 
creation first of all of multilateral banking and foreign trade 
structures. And this is why. 
  The representatives of world business continuously reproach 
us for the fact that the necessary legislative basis is lacking 
in Russia to this day, and that in this respect Russia 
noticeably lags behind Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. And this is 
actually the case. These two republics have already adopted, for 
example, such normative acts as the law on concessions and the 
law on guaranteed export of profits, and insurance of the 
entrepreneurial market against political instability has been 
introduced. But we have not yet come close to any of this, 
although we have been discussing it for two years already. The 
result of our sluggishness is not slow in coming: In the last 
two or three months 19 foreign firms moved from Russia to 
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. 
  We, i.e., along the RUIE line, have already prepared six 
draft laws to protect the rights of foreign entrepreneurs. We 
will strive for their adoption through our Duma group--we have 
20 deputies there. 
  However, it seems to me that our legislation should satisfy 
both sides: us and our partners from abroad. It will be possible 
to achieve this through the multilateral council conceived by 
our prime minister, in whose structure, for example, joint 
groups on problems of business and legislation, etc., will be 
established. It is in this that I see the main objective of his 
initiative in Davos. 
  [Zhemchugov] It was reported in the mass media that Russian 
representatives in Davos expressed sharply differing estimates 
on the current situation in our country and on the progress and 
outlook for economic reform. What can you say in this regard? 
  [Volskiy] Strictly speaking, there were two groups of 
Russians in Davos. One of them consisted of the official 
representatives of Russia, among whom were representatives of 
private entrepreneurial structures, the director corps, 
well-known economic scientists, and political figures. People 
like Ivan Kivelidi, Mark Goryachev, Irina Khakamada, Aleksandr 
Vladislavlev, Professor Yevgeniy Yasin, Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, and 
many others. 
  The other group consisted of those who were in Davos at the 
personal invitation of the organizers of this forum. They were 
Boris Fedorov, Nikolay Shmelev, Sergey Vasilyev, and some others. 
  I do not question the right of the hosts to present 
different 
points of view to the forum participants about what is happening 
in Russia. It is very likely that they tried to see to it that 
the picture was objective. But what turned out was absolutely 
different. 
  Two diametrically opposed points of view were brought to the 
attention of forum participants. One--reforms are proceeding in 
Russia, and they will continue, but they need certain 
adjustments. The other--reforms are at an end, and economic 
collapse and a return to the past are in store for the country. 
  Our prime minister, barely having set foot on Swiss soil, 
had 
to talk not about the outlook for cooperation between Russian 
and world business, but, in fact, to disavow the statements of 
some of his contemporaries who are unnecessarily dramatizing the 
situation in Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukhova: "Briefing at the Ministry of </F>
Foreign Economic Relations: Russia Does Not Want To Give Up a 
Positive Trade Balance with the West"] 
  [Text] Oleg Davydov, minister of foreign economic 
relations of Russia, talked at yesterday's briefing about the 
negotiations that were held in Switzerland with OPEC leaders and 
also about certain prospects for the decentralization of foreign 
economic activity. 
<H5>  Concerning Negotiations with OPEC leaders </H5>
  The main theme of the negotiations was the sharp drop in oil 
prices (to $12-$12.5 per barrel). However, as Mr. Davydov noted, 
the Russian delegation was also disturbed by the situation 
concerning gas prices. The world consumption of oil at present 
amounts to 63-64 million barrels per day, of which OPEC covers 
24 million, or a maximum of 28 million, barrels. The remainder 
is supplied by so-called "independent exporters." In Mr. 
Davydov's words, the OPEC proposal on Russia's joining the 
"independents" was discussed at the negotiations, but Moscow is 
not yet ready to adopt it, just as it is not ready to join OPEC. 
At the same time, the minister thinks that "coordination in the 
actions of Russia and the cartel should be activated," at least 
at the level of consultations. 
<H5>  Concerning the Import Tariff </H5>
  The MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations], in the 
words of the minister, is against increasing the import tariff, 
although there are different opinions in the government. In Mr. 
Davydov's opinion, given the absence of competition in the 
domestic market, an increase in import duties will provoke a 
price increase. Mr. Davydov noted that "political figures of the 
Zaveryukha type" forget that in today's economic situation it is 
not "customs duties that are to blame but the absence of 
consumer demand on the Russian market." The minister urged 
everyone not to forget about responsibility for adopting such 
protectionist measures, because similar retaliatory measures 
against Russia can be employed on the part of the West. Mr. 
Davydov named acting Minister of Finance Sergey Dubinin and 
Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays among his allies. 
<H5>  Concerning Exports of Cartels </H5>
  The head of Russia's MVES directed attention to the question 
of control over exports. In his opinion, exporters should 
control the market themselves and come to an agreement among 
themselves about export volumes and prices. For this, Mr. 
Davydov proposed to create a special organization of 
exporters--cartels. But "the initiative must come from them 
themselves." The state, in the form of the MVES, "should get out 
of export-import deliveries altogether and implement them only 
along the line of critical imports (for example, medicines)." 
<H5>  Concerning Decentralization of Foreign Economic Activity </H5>
  The state, in the words of Mr. Davydov, is generally 
"striving to get out of centralized imports." Today, there is a 
positive balance of several millions of dollars in trade with a 
number of Western countries. But Russia refuses to satisfy the 
requirement of Western partners to equalize the trade balance, 
and to use the "difference" for the purchase of their products. 
Moscow proposes to use acquired currency resources to stabilize 
the economy.

<F P=106> [Article by Yerlan Arynov, deputy director of the Republic </F>
of Kazakhstan Strategic Research Institute under the Republic 
president, candidate in economic science: "The Kazakh Diaspora 
in Mongolia."] 
  [Text] The Republic of Kazakhstan Strategic Research 
Institute under the Republic president carried out a survey in 
1992 for the purposes of investigating the social [and] living 
conditions of the Kazakh population of diaspora living in 
Bayan-Ologey Aymag in the Mongolian Republic. Presently we are 
offering an article based upon that research by Yerlan Arynov, 
deputy director of the institute, candidate in economic 
science. 
  The surface area of Bayan-Ologey Aymag, formed in 1940, is 
45,800 square km. The aymag comprises 2.9 percent of the 
territory of the Mongolian Republic. The aymag consists of 13 
territorial administrations. The aymag center is the settlement 
of Bayan Ologey. One third of the population of the aymag lives 
in the settlement. 
  According to 1992 figures, the population of the aymag had 
reached 102,800 persons. This was 4.6 percent of the total 
population of the Republic. The growth rate of the aymags was 
0.37 percent above the overall level of Republic. For that 
reason, the median age of the population of the aymag is. [sic] 
During recent years the growth rate has fallen considerably. 
Whereas in 1990 annual growth reached 6,600 persons (7.2 
percent), it declined to 4,700 persons in 1991 (4.6 percent). 
Having a great influence on this was the migration of Kazakhs 
living in the aymag to their homeland, to Kazakhstan. 
  In general, for every 100 persons working there were, by 
contrast, 106 persons not fit for work in Mongolia in 1991. The 
figure reached 111 in the aymag. Whereas some 79.5 percent 
(37,400) of the inhabitants of Bayan-Ologey Aymag worked in 
various sectors of the economy, 20.5 percent (9,600) were 
unemployed. Some 2,100 of them were unemployed for specific 
reasons. 
  Looking at the economy of the aymag, animal husbandry is the 
primary focus there. According to figures for the beginning of 
1992, livestock numbered 1,158,300 with 68.0 percent of them in 
private hands. Almost 60 percent of the livestock were over 
three years old, and more than half of them are of the Kazakh 
Yedilbay breed. In the oblast at present are 11 economic unions 
(in Mongolian: somon), one state enterprise, and two enterprises 
processing agricultural products. The state enterprise mentioned 
controls a territory of 4,400 hectares, and produces annually 
800 tons of grain, 4,900 tons of potatoes, and 2,000 tons of 
fruits, berries and vegetables, etc. Some 17,300 persons work in 
that sector. 
  Operating in the aymag are a united energy industry (18.0 
million kilowatt hours of electrical energy and 116.0 
kilocalories of [thermal] energy), a coal mine (producing 
192,000 tons of coal), a food industry combine, a printing plant 
(producing 5.0 million printed pages), a wool-washing plant 
(washing 2,200 tons of wool), a rug-weaving unit (weaving 6,200 
square meters of carpet), a tungsten ore refining plant, and a 
construction trust. Whereas 2,400 persons work in the industrial 
sector (9.6 percent), 5,200 work in other production sectors 
(20.8 percent). 
  Some 9,300 persons serve in nonproducing sectors. They 
include: 3,800 persons (40.8 percent) in culture, education, and 
the arts; 2,600 persons (27.9 percent) in public health and 
physical education; 2,300 persons (24.7 percent) in domestic 
services and residential housing enterprise organizations; some 
100 persons (1.1 percent) in the sciences. 
  It must be mentioned that there were 2,300 persons (2.2 
percent) in the aymag in 1991 with higher educations; 39,500 
persons (38.4 percent) with general secondary educations. Among 
persons with an education: 28.6 percent had a primary school 
education; 37.7 percent had an incomplete middle education; 17.2 
percent had a complete middle education; 10.6 percent had a 
professional-technical or middle specialized education; and 5.8 
percent had a higher education. 
  In connection with the gradual entry of marketplace 
relations 
into the country in recent years, new professionals working in 
cooperate and small industries have begun to appear. In 1991 
there were 2,200 such professionals, that is 5.9 percent of the 
total population. 
  Let us look at the results of the social survey carried out 
among the Kazakhs of the Kazakh diaspora in Mongolia. A total of 
354 answers were received from questionnaires about present 
social and domestic circumstances, attitudes towards marketplace 
relationships, and intentions to return to the Kazakhstan 
homeland. Some 76 percent of those filling out the 
questionnaires were men and 22.6 percent women. As for the ages 
of respondents, 92.6 percent were between the ages of 16 and 54. 
  According to statistical information for 1991, 45.7 percent 
of the population of Bayan-Ologey was of work age, and 5.5 
percent were pensioners. A very large demographic group within 
the population was comprised of young people under 16 
years-of-age (48.8 percent). 
  For that reason views on social life and livelihood among 
Kazakhs living in Mongolia, and their intentions of returning to 
their homeland were primarily taken from the age group 
indicated. Let us first look at the possibilities for livelihood 
and at the average monthly salary of each family: 33.9 percent 
received 200-1000 tugriks [a month]; 51.1 percent received 
1001-2000 tugriks; 10.7 percent received 2001-3000 tugriks; 2.3 
percent received more than 3000 tugriks. 
  It turned out that more than half of respondents received 
1001-2000 tugriks. Income by families is as follows: 25.4 
percent, 200-1000 tugriks; 53.1 percent, 201-700 tugriks; 16.7 
percent, 701-1500 tugriks. [sic] There is no information for 
those families receiving more than 1500 tugriks. Such levels of 
income cannot guarantee a good life-style for 74.0 percent of 
families. For that reason, they cannot meet their daily family 
expenses unless they sell [their] valuable [personal] goods. 
  At the time of the survey, unfortunately, nothing was 
recorded about supplementary sources of income. Almost 16.7 
percent of respondents had savings, even if small, and did not 
need to sell valuables. Only 1.7 percent of respondents 
indicated that they could buy expensive goods, including 
automobiles. 
  The vast majority of those answering the questionnaire 
thought that the service sector of the aymag was poor. If we 
break this down into percentages: 50.0 percent of respondents 
were dissatisfied with stores selling goods produced by 
industry; 50.5 percent with food stores; 46.1 percent with 
transport; 41.2 percent with social food services centers; 40.4 
percent with trade; and 40.1 percent of the people were 
dissatisfied with the services of residential housing communal 
enterprises. It is not difficult to understand from the replies 
that the conclusion is that service in service establishments is 
at a very low level. On the other hand, 86.4 percent of 
respondents gave a favorable evaluation to childrens 
organizations, i.e., kindergarten; 88.7 percent to medical 
organizations; and 74.7 percent to cultural centers. 
  However, respondents in general had a great deal of hope in 
the improvement of their present living conditions. While 7.3 
percent of respondents said they considered themselves average 
as far as material well-being, 17.0 considered themselves good. 
Only a portion of this group answered poor. The quality of food 
in comparison to the quality of clothing appeared to have 
improved two-fold recently in the view of those responding. 
  Thus, can we not understand from this information the Kazakh 
custom of putting a good face on any bad situation, no matter 
how bad it is. In research on living standards, carried out in 
terms of three variants, poor, average, good, the vast majority 
of the people said good. Let us look into this. 
  Some 85.3 percent of respondents expressed satisfaction with 
relations with their fellow employees; 61.3 percent with their 
health; 59.3 percent with their work assignments; 50.6 percent 
with the work they were doing; 62.4 percent with their 
specialties; 68.7 percent with conditions in their social lives; 
and 49.7 percent with housing. Those dissatisfied with their 
lives were around 1.7 percent. 
  Now, what were respondents concerned about? They were 
dissatisfied with their wages (poor, 19.2 percent, good, 11.3 
percent), their vacations (poor, 13.3 percent, good, 22.3 
percent), and poor use of free time (poor, 15.5 percent, good, 
22.3 percent). Summarizing these results, the problem is the 
poor living conditions of families and the poor organization of 
proper vacations. 
  Asked whether or not the work of social services 
organizations had improved fundamentally during the last 
four-five years, most answered no. It was easily ascertained 
that there is a shortage of goods in high demand (90.7 percent), 
that there are transportation problems (81.6 percent), that the 
quality of medical service is poor (64.7 percent), and, 
likewise, that the quality of work in the cultural 
establishments is poor (69.2 percent). By way of compensation, 
the number of trade industries and cooperatives has grown in 
accordance with market reform. 
  Inhabitants of the aymag gave the following answers 
regarding 
where they get their clothing and food. It was hard to determine 
a clear response. Considerable confusion was found in the of 
purchase of the above goods. Some 26.6 percent made their own 
clothing; 25.4 percent bought their clothing in the public 
market; and 14.4 percent bought it in stores. 
  Half of respondents made it clear that, while they obtained 
foods like meat and milk from relatives or from individual 
enterprises, they purchased vegetables, fruits and berries, 
break, and fish only from stores. This must be because such 
varieties of food are not plentiful in Mongolia. 
  All in all, many respondents felt that the of supply of food 
at present was average or bad. If we rely upon answers from the 
heads of Kazakh families living in Mongolia to questions about 
their basic interests and desires to migrate to their homeland, 
8.5 percent said they were preparing to move back to their 
native soil. Some 58.8 percent said they would come in 1993; 
however, 34.5 percent said they will migrate in the next two 
years. It was clear that while 85.3 percent would migrate to 
Kazakhstan with their entire families, 4.0 percent would come on 
their own. 
  Let us now touch upon the question of which oblast in 
Kazakhstan our kinsmen in Mongolia would likely migrate to. Some 
22.3 percent of the heads of the families would make Eastern 
Kazakhshtan Oblast their new home; 17.8 percent, Qaraghandy 
Oblast; 10.7 percent, Almaty Oblast; 7.0 percent, Almaty City; 
9.0 percent, Koshetaw Oblast; 5.6 percent, Qostanay Oblast. Only 
a very small part of them would migrate to Atyraw, Torghay, 
Qyzylorda, Aqtobe, and Aqmola oblasts. 
  Kazakhs from the diaspora in Mongolia are considering 
migration to oblasts where they will no doubt have a very 
favorable influence on the growth of the Kazakh demography of 
those oblasts and upon the formation of a linguistic 
environment. For that reason the state must do everything 
possible for them. 
  Some 30.5 percent of those preparing to return to the 
homeland are considering settlement in rural areas; 48.9 percent 
in cities. Among those planning to live a city, 7.1 percent plan 
to live in the capital. 
  Barriers to migration: 28.0 percent said they were 
influenced 
by material difficulties, 23.5 percent by differences in law, 
and 15 percent by Republic political problems. 
  While 44.1 percent of respondents expected to purchase state 
apartments or houses immediately after migrating, 13.8 percent 
expected to live with relatives. While 87 percent of them would 
rely on material aid provided by the state, only 5.4 percent 
expressed confidence in their own resources and funding. 
  As the results of the survey show, the great hope of the 
overwhelming majority is to return to the homeland and to live 
there, developing their language and religion. Thus, the 
generations of a sovereign nation will increase. In particular, 
it is a source of joy that they have chosen regions where 
Russian-speakers are concentrated. However, like the saying a 
dry spoon tears the mouth [i.e., there are good and bad aspects 
to things], we should not forget that only 5.4 percent of 
respondents place confidence in their own finances. The rest 
expect aid from the state. Whereas only 16.8 percent plan to buy 
housing immediately, 13.8 percent will continue to live with 
relatives. For that reason, bearing in mind the fact that 
Kazakhs of the diaspora in Mongolia are poorly provided for 
materially, we must make special efforts when material 
assistance is organized through state and social organizations. 
We must devote attention to learning the native Kazakh language 
and to the consolidation of a linguistic environment. This is 
because the number of Kazakh people in the regions of Kazakhstan 
is low. For example, according to 1989 figures 27.2 percent of 
the people in Eastern Kazakhstan Oblast are Kazakh, 17.2 percent 
of the people in Qaraghandy Oblast are Kazakh, and the 
representatives of the Russian people 52.2 percent [sic]. This 
being the case, we must not forget that 22.3 and 17.2 percent 
respectively [of Mongolian Kazakhs wishing to migrate] have 
expressed an interest in settling in these oblasts. If the 
entire Kazakh population of Mongolia were to migrate, there is 
no question that this would lead to a radical change in the 
national demography of Kazakhstan. The reason is that the vast 
majority of them are large families. We must not forget that in 
nearly 60 percent of the families there are more than three 
children.

<F P=106> [Interview with Amantay Bazarbayuly Zholdybayev, chief of </F>
the Kazakh Civil Aviation Administration, recorded by Saghidola 
Akhmetqaliyev: We Are a People Who Understand How To Soar to the 
Heavens..."] 
  [Text] I have been involved for some time with the 
editors of the magazine ZERDE, and there have been cases where I 
have written articles about general aviation, aircraft, and the 
aviation industry. Articles and thoughts were intended to 
increase the knowledge of the Kazakh reader about aviation and 
to draw more of our young people into that specialty. 
  I myself worked in the sector for more than 30 years, and I 
am now a pensioner. I make the following observations: while we 
are a very great people, a great nation, there are very few of 
our young people in civil aviation. There are in fact many 
reasons for this. We have now become an independent people, and 
we are proud of the fact that Kazakhstan is an independent 
nation. This is a joy and a delight. However, for us to be a 
sovereign nation in fact we will have to have our own 
specialists in every sector, that is our own architects, our own 
pilots, our own ministers of state. 
  Recently there have been changes, even if small ones, taking 
place in civil aviation in the Republic. One of the best things 
about this is that at the head of it all is one of our own 
people, a man called Amantay Bazarbayuly Zholdybayev. We must 
tell the truth. Since the formation of the Kazakh Civil Aviation 
Administration, there has never been a Kazakh holding the post 
of chief of the administration.. 
  Recently the editors of ZERDE asked me to talk with the new 
head of the Civil Aviation Administration, and to exchange 
views, so that the people would know who he is and where he 
comes from, and to prepare an article for the magazine about my 
interview. I am not a journalist, nor am I a reporter. While I 
wondered in my mind how I could do it, I realized that I had 
done a certain amount of work in the aviation sector, and that 
its inner workings were somewhat more familiar to me than to 
others, and, for that reason, I should go ahead and interview 
Zholdybayev and write the article. I considered it my duty to 
today's young people as someone senior and as a former aviation 
bort engineer [sic]. 
  It has been said by others, whether out of envy or out of a 
grudge, that the new chief has only flown an AN-2 and knows 
nothing about other kinds of aircraft. We must understand the 
reason for this statement and its basis. People, who have 
control of their own lives and who have not been as successful 
as they could be, should not be terribly jealous of others. 
  According to what I know, Amantay has indeed flown an AN-2. 
He has flown aircraft such as the AN-24, IL-18, YAK-40, Tu-154, 
and IL-76, and has gained experience at several levels. Not only 
has he flown these planes, but, hitherto, has been in various 
management positions. You can tell this from the conversation 
below. 
  [Akhmetqaliev] Amantay, from the beginning we have been a 
people who have known how to fly to the heavens, into the 
heights, into the blue. The passage of time has permitted our 
becoming a sovereign country. May you be successful in your new 
post! The people do not know you as well as they should. For 
that reason would you first of all talk about yourself? 
  [Zholdybayev] What can I say about my biography?... I came 
into the world at the end of the war, that is in 1944 in Atbasar 
City, Aqmola Oblast. After completing school I worked on the 
railroad for several years. From childhood I have wanted to 
become a flier. Led by that hope, at 18 I entered the Civil 
Aviation Flier Training School at Karasnokutsk in Saratov 
[Oblast]. After completing this school, I returned to Aqmola. I 
began my career as a flier by flying AN-2s. Later I flew AN-24s. 
In time I completed the Civil Air Line Academy in Leningrad, the 
present St. Petersburg. Refining my professional experience and 
knowledge in this area, I learned to fly other kinds of aircraft 
and to master them. In general the profession of pilot has its 
own difficulties. You know there is a school for the mastery of 
each type of aircraft. 
  [Akhmetqaliyev] You were a pilot and now you manage pilots. 
That is an art in and of itself. It is difficult to do two 
entirely different things. For example, I was by profession a 
bort engineer. I never took part in administrative/managerial 
activities. 
  [Zholdybayev] I agree. 
  Professionals should manage pilots and the aviation sector 
in 
general. During the years 1980-1983 I managed the Semey airport, 
after that I managed Qaraghandy Airport. However, starting in 
1987 I was first deputy chief of the Kazakh Civil Aviation 
Administration. Thus, I well understood the difficulties and 
responsibilities of the chief of the administration. However, I 
am far from saying that I know everything. This is because life 
makes new demands with each passing day. I think that we are 
learning as things come up. 
  [Akhmetqaliyev] It is well known that all of our aircraft 
and 
other technology and equipment are an inheritance from the 
former Union. We are now establishing connections with other 
countries as an independent nation. These connections are 
through air routes. However, travelers will be selecting more 
convenient and more comfortable aircraft in the future. Our 
aircraft cannot be compared with Boeings from the United States. 
For that reason, are there thoughts about purchasing much higher 
quality aircraft from foreign countries? What kind of 
commercial steps are being undertaken? 
  [Zholdybayev] I am in agreement, my friend. This area is 
already something difficult for us. This is because we are 
suffering the pressure of financial exigency. Like others, we 
would like to purchase the latest aircraft. However, our purse 
is [too] empty for this. In the beginning we thought to purchase 
foreign A-310 aircraft. This powerful aircraft is the best in 
several ways, and is jointly made by all European countries. 
Last year the Moscow International Sheremetyev Airport purchased 
four of such aircraft. They are now flying from Moscow to 
various countries in Europe and Southeast Asian. Judging by what 
passengers say, these aircraft are comfortable and convenient. 
  The situation cannot remain as it is. Our financial 
situation 
will improve, and, if every thing works out, I think that there 
will be a day when our travelers will ride on these aircraft. 
  [Akhmetqaliyev] You were talking about shortage of finances. 
However, one thing worrying most people regarding aviation is 
the continuing rise in the prices of airline tickets. What 
explanations do you have to offer and what understanding can you 
provide? 
  [Zholdybayev] The continued rise in the price of airline 
tickets is not connected with us. This is not something which is 
under our control or influence. Influencing this above all are 
increases in the price of fuel and other needed materials, 
equipment, and spare parts. In addition, we have to buy all 
these things from others. We make none of them ourselves. For 
that reason anyone can understand the degree to which we are 
under the control of others. 
  However, common people consider it our fault when the cost 
of 
airline tickets is high. We must understand them. This is 
because today's prices cannot be paid by every other person. 
However, in an era of rapid change such as the present, they 
have no choice but to fly. 
  Nonetheless, it is anticipated that only when prices begin 
to 
go down and the market economy is stabilized will our ticket 
costs be controlled. 
  [Akhmetqaliyev] Amantay, as you yourself know, we must 
prepare more specialists among our young people for civil 
aviation. What I would like to ask in that regard is this: do 
you have thoughts about having our young people study in foreign 
countries, in developed countries in particular? 
  [Zholdybayev] Indeed, I have such thoughts. However, the 
financial difficulties just mentioned will not allow us to 
achieve them. This is because sending our young people abroad to 
study will require foreign exchange. We have very little foreign 
exchange at present. We have it for some purposes, but not for 
others. 
  As I have said, there is a professional school in Aqtobe 
City 
at the level of an institution of higher education preparing 
specialists for civil aviation. It will train pilot-engineers, 
copilot-engineers, and air traffic controllers. Our young people 
interested in these specialties will not have to go far, but 
can, on the contrary, be trained there. They must pass tests in 
Kazakh to be admitted. However, teaching entirely in Kazakh is 
something for the future. Thorough preparation will be needed 
for that. The most important requirement for those seeking 
admittance will be the best possible health. After that literacy 
and knowledge will be important. 
  There is one thing I wish to mention in this connection. I 
must tell the truth. Our young people have no great interest in 
aviation. They are more interested in the specialized 
occupations that they encounter on a daily basis than in 
aviation specialties. This is only to be expected. For that 
reason, if we would like to increase the number of our own 
specialists in aviation, we must begin professional training 
within the walls of the schools. It would be all the more 
wonderful if we, like the Japanese, were to teach kindergarden 
children what is an airplane and who a pilot is. 
  However, our young people can go to the Institute for 
Preparing Civil Aviation Engineers in Kiev if they pass the 
entrance exams in Almaty. There is an agreement between 
ourselves and that organization regarding the preparation of 
such specialists. 
  [Akhmetqaliyev] Will aircraft be sold to individuals in 
Kazakhstan? Recently we have heard a great deal about an 
aircraft called MAI-890. Will individuals be able to buy this 
aircraft? 
  [Zholdybayev] In most developed countries aircraft are sold 
to individuals. However, these are not very large aircraft, but 
aircraft seating two-three or five-six persons. Other than 
owners of major industries who need such aircraft, no one, no 
matter how much commotion they make or how famous they are, buys 
large aircraft. This is because they know the price and place of 
everything well. In addition, all things created by the hand of 
a person with a clear intention, and with advanced conceptions 
must serve the good of man. 
  However, as for the MAI-890 aircraft you recently mentioned, 
it is true that it is a small aircraft built for commercial 
purposes. It is an aircraft which would be very convenient for 
sportsmen, farmers, geologists, firemen, motor vehicle 
inspectorate workers, and for herdsmen working at a distance. 
One could learn to fly it in a day. It is made from very 
expensive metal and from high quality technology. 
  Was not the MIG-29 military aircraft tested by our first 
cosmonaut Toqtar Awbakirov? The MAI-890 is manufactured by a 
section of that plant [where the MIG-29 is manufactured]. Though 
we are behind in other areas, we used to make powerful and high 
quality military technology. 
  The MAI-890 was evaluated highly by the famous German test 
pilot Doctor U. Unger. After flying the aircraft, he said: I 
realize that this aircraft was created by pure experts. It is 
small, convenient, and comfortable but we are doing nothing in 
particular to sell it. This is because its initial price at the 
1992 Moscow air show was 15,000 dollars. The price has now risen 
further. 
  [Akhmetqaliyev] In soccer there are the players and the 
fans. 
That is to say, we have heard that along with managing you are 
still going off on missions and flying. Is not it difficult to 
perform two such responsible tasks at once. 
  [Zholdybayev] It is true, I still go off on long flights 
with 
Tu-154s and IL-76s. I notice no difficulty. In my view, it is 
good to fly to keep up the level of one's skills. In one way 
this helps me understand things more deeply as I set myself to 
the task of managing.

<F P=106> [Article by Gamlet Matevosyan: "The Privatization Process </F>
Has Finally Gotten Underway: Levon Ter-Petrosyan Had To Turn to 
the Declaration of Independence"] 
  [Text] Yerevan--The issue of approving a program for 
privatization and denationalization of enterprises and 
facilities under construction for 1994 was discussed at an 
extraordinary session of the Supreme Council of Armenia convened 
on the initiative of Levon Ter-Petrosyan, president of the 
republic. 
  It should be noted that so far only three branch plants of 
large state enterprises have been privatized. There was a time 
when the republic, having adopted the Law "On Privatization of 
Land," was in the orbit of economic reforms. At the time the 
foreign press wrote about the courage of the Republic of Armenia 
Government, about a radical turn in the national economy away 
from command and toward market methods. However, the reformist 
zeal gradually ran out, and now Armenia is bringing up the rear 
in this process. They have been talking about a market economy 
for four years now, but what market relations may there be in 
the absence of privatization and private property? Three hundred 
shops and other small facilities hardly make a difference. 
  Speaking at the session, Chairman of the State Committee for 
Privatization Simon Konakhchyan stated that the privatization of 
more than 8,900 facilities is envisioned within the framework of 
the 1994 program--shops, enterprises processing agricultural 
products and manufacturing consumer goods, and facilities under 
construction. At present, the fixed capital of the republic is 
appraised at 12.5 billion drams. The plan for this year is to 
privatize property worth 2.3 billion drams. In the process, 
transportation, railways, nuclear power stations, and quite a 
number of other facilities are not subject to privatization. 
  Supporters of the adoption of the government program believe 
that it will assist in setting in motion a new economic 
mechanism and embarking on a civilized path of economic 
development which will, of course, bring about favorable social 
changes within society. 
  Many members of parliament, in particular the fraction of 
the 
Armenian National Movement (AOD), have come out in favor of the 
immediate approval of the program, pointing out that under these 
conditions in which the state lacks funds, bridges, roads, and 
residential buildings have ended up as facilities under 
construction. They may be commissioned within short periods of 
time upon being privatized with the help of foreign investment. 
  The opposition did not have a uniform opinion on this issue. 
From the point of view of the Ramkavar-Azatakan Party (Liberal 
Democrats), privatization will make it possible to begin the 
formation in the republic of an owner class in the absence of 
which an amelioration of the economic situation is 
inconceivable. Some deputies (from the Dashnaktsutyun, the 
Communist Party of the Republic of Armenia, and the 
National-Democratic Union) called on their colleagues not to be 
in a hurry for two reasons: first, because of the absence of the 
necessary legal foundation, and second, because Armenia, which 
as a matter of fact is on a wartime footing, needs a maximum of 
control and centralization of all resources in the hands of the 
state. 
  All the i's were dotted by the presentation of President 
Ter-Petrosyan, who pointed out that privatization is unavoidable 
and recalled that even the Declaration of Independence of 
Armenia passed in September 1990 referred to the need to 
establish market relations. Besides, small enterprises account 
for 61 percent of the facilities to be privatized. Therefore, in 
essence, the proposal was to approve the program of small-scale 
privatization. 
  Thereafter, the program was passed by a majority vote.

<F P=106> [Article by Emmanuil Mkrtchyan: "The Last of the Mohicans"] </F>
  [Text] Yerevan--"Our Levon!"--this is how a crowd of 
many thousands which converged on Theater Square from the 
outskirts of the Armenian capital in response to an appeal by 
the Karabakh Committee called him. It was precisely at these 
rallies in 1988 that the political biography of current 
President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrosyan began. He made his way 
from learned secretary of the Institute of Ancient Manuscripts 
to the first president of an independent Armenia not only 
through the crowds of democrats but also through the corridors 
of Butyrki Prison. Together with like-minded people, 
Ter-Petrosyan began to knock the already loose bricks out of the 
foundation of the Soviet party and state system, which was still 
quite strong at the time. Whether he is good or bad at present 
as the head of state is another question. However, Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan has passed the test of power. 
  Recently, he told journalists: "If my personality becomes an 
obstacle to the democratic development of the republic, you do 
not have to worry: The people will find an opportunity to get 
rid of me." To be sure, Ter-Petrosyan now appeals to the people 
on extremely rare occasions, nor does he like contacts with the 
press. The authority of the president has been shaken 
considerably over the last two years, and few people at present 
call him "ours." A rampage of crime and the lack of legal and 
social protection for a majority of citizens are the reasons. 
Perhaps nothing remains of the romantic revolutionary spirit 
that animated the people of Armenia as recently as a couple of 
years ago. 
  Apparently, we may talk about the phenomenon of Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan only in one area: At present he is perhaps the 
only head of a state-former republic of the disintegrated Soviet 
Union who has not shared the fate of similar politicians from 
other former republics: Landsbergis, Elchibey, Gamsakhurdia. He 
has managed not to lose to any of his opponents. Many people are 
ready to give their votes to Levon even now, no matter how 
strong the nostalgic mood is in Armenian society and no matter 
how much people want order, heat, and bread. This is happening 
despite the direct association between the president and the 
activities of the ruling AOD [Armenian National Movement]. 
Judging from public opinion polls, confidence in the AOD is 
close to the zero mark. The president is "hanging on" due to his 
authority, and the AOD--due to the president. 
  The political fiasco of the AOD was built in long before it 
came to power. It has its origins in the active struggle of many 
AOD figures for ecology, the wisdom of which was actually 
sacrificed to political ambitions. Rallies, hunger strikes, and 
strikes brought about the closure of the largest chemical and 
metallurgical production facilities. The campaign for 
mothballing the Armenian "nuke" became the first baptism by fire 
for many of the current political leaders. Thus the breakdown of 
the economy of the republic was started; in the absence of the 
energy sector and industry, the independence of the republic 
became a mere formality. The burden of these problems 
subsequently devolved on the president and his team, and they 
began increasingly often to act against their better judgment. 
One of the AOD leaders stated: "We proceeded toward power and at 
times did not reckon with the price at which it was secured." 
  Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who assumed the reins of government in 
the republic in 1990 first as chairman of the Supreme Council, 
and subsequently as president, faced two tasks: reinforcing 
state independence and resolving the Karabakh issue. His refusal 
to hold the all-Union referendum in Armenia and reluctance to 
maintain contacts with a communist Moscow gave certain forces 
the pretext to accuse Levon Ter-Petrosyan of political 
immaturity, which allegedly became the reason for military 
pressure on Karabakh. 
  The opposition and the independent press, which criticize 
the 
policy of Ter-Petrosyan without restraint, frequently pay 
attention to the cadre issue. The selection and assignment of 
cadres became the "Achilles' heel" of the Armenian president. On 
one occasion he himself admitted that he had relied on his 
advisers too much and had made erroneous choices. This was quite 
natural: On coming to power, AOD figures were in a hurry to pay 
up on the I.O.U.'s produced by yesterday's brethren in struggle, 
and it nearly came to the replacement of the entire director 
corps of the country. To this day it is easy to find 
nonprofessionals, ambitious amateurs, and at times simply 
ignoramuses prepared to serve the AOD and the president 
faithfully holding executive positions in state organs. The 
nomenklatura is mostly selected on the principle of personal 
devotion. Only on one occasion did the president abandon this 
approach by appointing his political adversary Vazgen Manukyan 
as minister of defense. Manukyan, the "godfather" of the AOD, an 
ex-prime minister, and an energetic person, succeeded in 
creating a disciplined and well-armed national army. However, 
ultimately the president showed his character and relieved the 
minister from his position because Manukyan's authority had 
grown to a level that was dangerous to Ter-Petrosyan. 
  When it comes to the activities of the Armenian opposition, 
observers evaluate it variously. Some call it weak and helpless; 
others voice the opinion that the opposition does not even 
strive for power and therefore does not show itself fully. 
Undoubtedly, the conditions in which Armenia lives, labors, and 
fights for Karabakh are absolutely unfavorable for taking power. 
No matter how calamitous the situation of the republic, which is 
actually in the clutches of a blockade and deprived of light and 
gas, might be, external factors--the military situation in 
Karabakh and the political situation in Russia--influence the 
fate of its leadership tremendously. 
  The opposition accuses the president of an attempt to usurp 
power by foisting on the people his draft of the Constitution. 
The new Main Law gives the president extensive rights: He will 
dissolve the parliament, appoint the prime minister, judges, and 
so on. Of course, such a Constitution cannot suit the 
opposition. It is preparing to do battle, which will begin as 
soon as the president sets the date of a referendum. However, 
the president is in no hurry. 
  Peculiarities of political life in Armenia shine through in 
a 
complete absence of pro-government forces. All parties, of which 
there are about 30, prefer to remain in opposition. The Armenian 
Revolutionary Federation Dashnaktsutyun and the 
Democratic-Liberal Party Ramkavar-Azatakan are the most powerful 
of them. From the time of the first Armenian republic of 
1918-1920 until recently, these parties existed in emigration 
but continued to operate. On returning to the motherland, the 
Ramkavar-Azatakan Party first supported the president and then 
went into "soft opposition." The Dashnak Party, whose 
orientation is socialist, became the main opposing force. The 
causes of enmity between the president and the Dashnaktsutyun 
are found in differing approaches to the historic fate of the 
people rather than in a struggle for power. The AOD concept is 
based on gradually breaking down the geopolitical traditionalism 
of Armenians, which is associated with the problem of Armenian 
lands taken away by fire and sword, through mass genocide. In 
the opinion of AOD leaders, including the conviction of Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan, Armenia must live in the present and not use the 
tragic pages of its history as a political weapon. The foreign 
policy concept of the AOD does not recognize geopolitics based 
on specific orientations; the AOD maintains: We have neither 
eternal enemies (Turkey) nor eternal friends (Russia). The 
Dashnaktsutyun, which comes out against breaking down the 
Armenian national mentality, espouses the exact opposite point 
of view. 
  At present, domestic political stability is preserved in 
Armenia due to the powerful Karabakh factor. This issue is 
perhaps the only area of politics with regard to which a 
consensus continues to exist between the authorities and the 
opposition. The efforts of Levon Ter-Petrosyan to solve the 
problem by political means enjoy complete support in the 
republic. Instead, the opposition has an opportunity to make its 
presence known on another issue: It demands that the authorities 
ensure elementary social guarantees for the people. After all, 
Armenia is going through a second terrifying winter--there is no 
electricity, no heat; the average salary may buy 1.5 liters of 
kerosene or a kilogram of meat. At a recent extraordinary 
session of the parliament, the president proposed from the 
rostrum that the people eat only bread. 
  A wave of outrage swept the republic; the opposition 
threatened a revolt. On the day of the parliamentary battle, 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who clearly was out of sorts, nonetheless 
agreed to answer several of my questions, refusing however to 
touch on the topics of big-time politics and relations between 
Armenia and Russia. 
  [Mkrtchyan] Mr. President, what is your assessment of the 
situation that exists in the republic? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] It is very complicated, contradictory, and 
uncertain. I am not in a position to characterize it 
unambiguously, although it is clear that it has emerged as a 
consequence of a multitude of piled-up causes which are 
characteristic of the period of transition. All of us--myself, 
the leader of the state, state officials, and businessmen--are 
to some degree like schoolchildren in the process of asserting 
independent statehood: We are learning to live under new 
conditions. 
  [Mkrtchyan] What are the reasons for this unprecedented 
socioeconomic crisis? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] On one hand, the reasons are of a purely 
objective nature. As far as subjective aspects are concerned, I 
can note the main point: The legal and legislative foundation is 
imperfect here. We have not been able to develop clear-cut 
mechanisms for adopting laws; current legislation fails to keep 
up with life and causes chaos and disorder. I agree that at many 
levels professionalism is lacking in the accomplishment of 
particular tasks. However, we are entitled to a mistake en route 
on an unknown path. My personal decisions may also be erroneous. 
  [Mkrtchyan] What has been your main mistake? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] I admit that I do not always feel the 
timeliness of a particular decision I make. This is particularly 
the case with the issue of reforms in the economic and social 
spheres. 
  [Mkrtchyan] Mr. President, what is your attitude toward the 
concept of creating a coalition government? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] If life commands, there will be a coalition 
government; there will also be new elections, perhaps early 
elections. However, for now the political situation in the 
republic is developing in such a way that it is absolutely not 
necessary to go for this. 
  [Mkrtchyan] Will you go for improving your relations with 
the 
opposition? What complaints do you have about the opposition? 
  [Ter-Petrosyan] I do not have complaints about it. The 
opposition does what it considers correct, and decides itself 
what it is to do. It is not up to me to instruct it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Armenian Minister of Agriculture Ashot </F>
Voskanyan by unidentified correspondent: "`There Is Someone to 
Think About the Peasants...'"] 
  [Text] 
  [Correspondent] How has the introduction of national 
currency 
and the financial shocks which ensued had an effect in the field 
of agriculture? 
  [Voskanyan] I could not truthfully say that the peasant has 
suffered more than city residents, let us say, as a consequence 
of the monetary exchange. The rural living standard is higher 
today. The exchange of money would have taken place more 
favorably if we had had the appropriate market substructures, 
aside from the state structures, and had buying and selling 
organizations in the private sector. They could have been given 
certain privileges to bring agricultural products into the 
market. I want to emphasize that a large amount of output has 
been accumulated in the countryside today, especially potatoes 
and vegetables. Our objective is to deliver 420,000 metric tons 
of potatoes to city residents. 
  [Correspondent] In a press conference several months ago, 
you 
advanced the idea of establishing purchasing organizations and 
insisted that it be put into effect without fail. What has been 
done in this regard? 
  [Voskanyan] The Ministry of Agriculture itself has studied 
this problem, and I can say that we have procured 1,500 metric 
tons of seed potatoes. This means that we will be able to work 
with the peasant in the spring, that is, to sell or grant him 
credit to buy seed potatoes. We have been trying to find markets 
outside the republic. One of these days our ministry 
representatives will travel to Pyatigorsk, where a trade fair 
will be organized and we will sell wool, geranium oil, and 
seeds, which our republic has in abundance. And I think we 
should proceed to privatize with confidence and establish 
purchasing organizations based on different forms of ownership. 
Certain steps have already been taken in this direction. 
  [Correspondent] Be more specific about them, if possible. 
  [Voskanyan] A commission on barter has been formed in the 
Ministry of Agriculture which can buy products locally and sell 
them where there is a demand for them. Despite the fact that 
this is not part of our ministry's responsibilities, we will 
make changes in our charter enabling the Ministry of Agriculture 
to engage in sales matters as well. This is a specific measure 
provided in the program for 1994. So the commission has already 
been formed and it is functioning. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. minister, please tell us what will 
happen 
to the credit emission (13.5 billion rubles [R]) allocated for 
agriculture, especially as the agricultural administrations have 
permitted a large number of abuses in the emission's 
distribution, according to peasants and official reports. 
  [Voskanyan] According to our assessments, use of the credit 
emission in agriculture has been very effective. To begin with, 
R7.5 billion of the R13.5 billion were allocated to the rayons 
for them to distribute locally, and R6 billion were allocated to 
various organizations in the agricultural system. What did we 
achieve? First of all, we were able to maintain the number of 
fowl in poultry farming, which had decreased to the lowest 
point. If we have credit funds in 1994, we will provide them for 
peasant farms once again, since the system is working. 
  Some 420,000 metric tons of potatoes have been produced in 
the republic. This is the highest indicator in recent decades. 
Light frosts last year caused substantial damage to viticulture, 
and the gross output of grain reached 310,000 metric tons. We 
regret to point out that the average yield of grain crops 
declined, but vegetable production reached 480,000 metric tons. 
This indicator does not take cabbage production into account. 
  I would like to say a few words about the number of 
livestock. We do not see an overall decrease in the number of 
livestock in the republic. This problem has to be approached 
from a different viewpoint. We must follow the best possible 
path: the number of animals has to be brought into conformity 
with the forage reserve in the republic. Concentrated feeds are 
not coming into the republic as in previous years, and I do not 
think they will be delivered in the years ahead. 
  [Correspondent] What is the situation with regard to the 
supply of diesel fuel, which the prices of agricultural products 
depend on to a large extent? Spring sowing lies ahead, and the 
peasants are very concerned about this. 
  [Voskanyan] Joining my colleagues, I must note with regret 
that the agreements concluded are not always put into effect. 
  Our preparation period is in December and January, and we 
will try to make the best use of it. We intend to bring 5,000 
metric tons of fuel into the republic through the Ministry of 
Agriculture's efforts alone. The government will also allocate a 
certain quantity, but I cannot say how much yet. 
  [Correspondent] At what prices will it be sold to the 
peasants? 
  [Voskanyan] At prices lower than market prices, naturally. 
And generally speaking, all those measures which are implemented 
with the help of the Ministry of Agriculture are always at 
prices substantially below market prices. 
  [Correspondent] And a final question. What would you like to 
say to a peasant in this difficult situation which has taken 
shape? 
  [Voskanyan] There are many states in a similar situation, 
but 
these problems will pass like rainy days. I think the current 
government will manage to bring the republic out of the 
situation that has developed. Our peasant farms and our peasants 
should realize that they are thought about. It would be correct 
if they were not only consumers, but obtained the needed 
fertilizer, seeds, and so forth beginning today to rescue us 
from inflation. I repeat: the Ministry of Agriculture will do 
everything in its power.

<F P=106> [Article by Ida Martirosyan: "We Do Not Put Off Anyone"] </F>
  [Text] "Free, sovereign!" When we declaimed these words, 
intoxicated with their very sound, hardly anyone pondered over 
such a category as human rights. Not because its significance 
was underestimated, but because it was assumed as self-evident 
within the same freedom over its entire multispectrum. To what 
extent have these expectations been realized? Rafael Papayan, 
chairman of the Commission on Human Rights of the Supreme Soviet 
of the Republic of Armenia, answers this question: 
  "With regard to freedom of speech, of the press, of 
religion, 
and of political convictions hardly anyone will be able to say 
that in our country they are restricted to any degree. On the 
contrary, according to statements by numerous Westerners to whom 
I have talked, in this respect we can have no claims against the 
authorities. After all, the spectrum of political views is 
represented in the party press and in the independent press and 
even on state television and radio. However, there is another 
aspect of human rights, that is, the social aspect, where the 
situation is by no means so comforting. This is understandable. 
After all, the social sphere is determined by the state of the 
economy--it is no secret to anyone in what deplorable state it 
is. Of course, there are objective reasons explaining this. 
However, they are so well known that there is no point in citing 
them. Although there are spheres, where order can be introduced, 
even with the barrage of attacks on the part of the same 
independent press. I have in mind the quite tough measures, 
which must be applied in transport, in power supply, and so 
forth. I do not doubt that people will perceive this not as a 
deviation from legal democratic norms, but as a purposeful 
attempt on the part of the authorities to introduce order where 
possible for the purpose of easing people's life. In the final 
analysis, this is protection of citizens' social rights. I will 
not reveal a secret if I say that our commission is swamped with 
letters containing all possible complaints about literally all 
matters. Often they have nothing to do with our work. It is 
obvious that, not finding a solution for their problems 
anywhere, people appeal to the parliament, since there is 
already an appropriate commission. I must say that we do not 
leave a single appeal unanswered. It happens that we are late, 
but only because we have too much to do. It is obvious that we 
can really help a very small part. If the matter is not within 
our competence, we turn it over to the relevant authorities. 
However, I can say one thing for sure: We do not put off anyone."

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Polonskiy: "Georgia: Victory Over Chaos </F>
as a Political Task"] 
  [Text] Of all the republics of the former USSR, 
Georgia has found itself in just about the most difficult 
situation. A succession of civil conflicts, an orgy of crime, 
and political instability are calling in question the very 
existence of the unified independent state. The living standard 
has fallen as far as it can: with a subsistence minimum of 4 
million coupons, the actual minimum wage constitutes 50,000; 97 
percent of the population is living below the poverty line, and 
for a long time the basic foodstuffs have for the majority been 
bread and tea. The orgy of crime is making everyday life 
unbearable, and almost every male aged between 16 and 60 has a 
gun. The Georgian government is making desperate attempts to 
push back the impending chaos, but the ambitions of the leaders 
of the opposition, the division of society, the clan 
contradictions, and the domination of the mafia groups are 
making any constructive work inordinately difficult. 
  In the opinion of Vakhtang Rcheushvili, vice speaker of 
parliament, it is essential that the republic, in order to cope 
with the crisis, define its foreign policy reference points, 
strive for economic stabilization, and curb the violence. 
Membership of the CIS and a return to the orbit of Russian 
influence could contribute to the accomplishment of these tasks 
to some extent, unless the mere fact of them serves to intensify 
the division of society. The opposition in Georgia is composed 
of parties whose existence--in the apt observation of 
parliamentary deputy G. Lordkipanidze--"becomes totally 
meaningless without the `Down With Russia' slogan." A 
characteristic example of such nationalist propaganda is 
afforded by the recent appeal to the Georgian people of the 
National Independent Party, which makes demands for the 
"de-occupation" of Georgia, the immediate resignation of 
Shevardnadze and his ministers, and the creation of a coalition 
government of "pro-West, anti-Russian, national, and 
democratic forces" and also proclaims that "the elections held 
in Russia showed Moscow's true colors," that Russia cannot be a 
democratic state, and that "anyone who supports Georgia's 
integration in the CIS or, in any form, Georgia's continuation 
in the sphere of influence of Russiashould be declared an 
enemy of state interests and the Georgian nation." 
  Nor, equally, in the Georgian government, meanwhile, is 
there 
any unity on questions of the expediency of participation in the 
work of the structures of the Commonwealth. In the course of the 
December conflict between Security Minister Igor Giorgadze and 
Defense Minister Georgiy Karkarashvili--a conflict which once 
again brought Georgia to the brink of civil war--Giorgadze 
accused Karkarashvili, specifically, of having thwarted the 
negotiations on a defense alliance in Ashgabat. The fact that 
both ministers were until recently still in office (a statement 
of Georgiy Karkarashvili, in which he announces his resignation, 
was carried in the Georgian press on 1 February) testifies that 
the most varied approaches to the problem of Georgia's 
introduction to the CIS are represented in the highest echelons 
of power (Giorgadze and Karkarashvili represent particular clans 
and groups, of course, but Georgia's situation is such that each 
group has integral interests and, correspondingly, integral 
notions concerning the political program). 
  Serious problems for Shevardnadze are being created also by 
the "special position" of the National Democratic Party of 
Georgia [NDPGr], which has the largest party parliamentary 
faction. At the Sixth National Democratic Party of Georgia 
Congress at the end of December 1993, membership of the CIS was 
seen as an "abdication of responsibility for Georgia's future," 
and addressing a meeting of the Europarliament, Gia Chanturia, 
the chairman of the party and well-known Georgian dissident, 
called for a weakening of Russia's influence in the republics of 
the former USSR and predicted for Georgia the role of some 
bridge between East and West. Evaluating the results of 
Shevardnadze's course as a failure in all spheres of foreign and 
domestic policy, the national democrats, who have supported the 
head of state since his return to Georgia, advocated a change of 
government and parliamentary elections no later than the spring 
of 1994. Chanturia declared that withdrawal from the government 
and the objections in principle to the policy of the authorities 
do not signify the NDPGr's switch to the opposition, but this 
does not make it any easier for Shevardnadze since he is 
deprived of the support of a most influential political party. 
In addition, certain prominent figures who performed leading 
roles in Georgia in 1992-1993, Tengiz Sigua, for example, have 
also opposed membership of the CIS. There is quite a banal 
paradox: easing the political opposition is possible only to the 
detriment of practical interests. 
  The bitter nature of the polemic surrounding 
Georgian-Russian 
relations is largely connected with another most acute 
question--the problem of the republic's territorial integrity. 
The position of Russia (or of certain circles in Russia) at the 
time of the Abkhaz war was taken very hard in Georgia, and the 
conflict surrounding South Ossetia equally affects the very 
essence of relations between the two countries, but the greatest 
significance is attached to the situation in Ajaria, Georgia's 
sole autonomy, where peace and a certain stability have been 
preserved amid the Georgian disturbances. Aslan Abashidze, 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Ajaria, has said repeatedly 
that he cannot conceive of a Georgia outside of an alliance with 
Russia, and people from the ranks of those closest to him make 
no secret of the fact that relations between Moscow and Batumi 
will intensify and strengthen regardless of the positions of the 
central leadership in Tbilisi. The leaders of Georgia's national 
radicals are inclined to see in Abashidze's firmness the "hand 
of Moscow" and are exploiting in every possible way the theme of 
a repetition of the "Abkhaz scenario" in Ajaria, but, and this 
is typical of the current situation in Georgia, they are by no 
means endeavoring to look for a compromise and reconsider their 
views for the sake of civil peace and the unity of the country. 
  Zurab Zhvania, chairman of the Green Party, just about the 
most serious independent politician and a decisive supporter of 
Shevardnadze's policy, once observed: "Georgia's tragedy is that 
the political confrontation is unfolding against the background 
of the struggle of mafia clans, an unprecedented flowering of 
corruption, and the domination of consumerism in all walks of 
life, that is, a total crisis of the civil society." A revival 
of the healthy self-awareness of the nation, the restoration of 
a normal moral climate, and a simplification of the political 
situation are becoming most important tasks, which (however 
utopian this may be for spiritual questions) have to be tackled 
by political methods. It is possible that the formation of the 
Georgian Citizens' Union (SGG), a new grassroots 
organization founded in December 1993 by several of the 
country's top politicians for the purpose of erecting a barrier 
in the way of petty political demagogy and ensuring support for 
constructive constitutional, economic, and cultural work, will 
contribute to a certain brightening of the situation. 
  The idea of the need for a large association which could 
assume responsibility for the country's future was first 
expressed a year ago by David Berdzenishvili, a leader of the 
Republican Party, but Shevardnadze showed no enthusiasm for such 
projects throughout 1993. Only after the arguments about 
Georgia's membership of the CIS had shown that the search for 
concord among politicians was doomed to fail did the head of 
state consent to head the Citizens' Union. "At this critical 
time," Georgiy Baramidze, a member of parliament from the Greens 
and deputy chairman of the SGG, declared, "the best part of 
Georgia's political spectrum has resolved to unite around a man 
personifying a specific policy," whose authority "was a 
tremendous stimulus to the consolidation of all constructive 
forces of Georgian society." The cementing role in the Citizens' 
Union was performed by the Green Party, whose leader 
simultaneously holds the position of vice president of the 
European Green Association, and also the Party of Peace and 
Freedom (Afghan veterans), whose chairman, Nodar Giorgadze, 
former instructor of the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth 
League Central Committee, who was responsible in Kabul for ties 
to Afghan youth, retains his decisive influence on the 
organizations of Afghan war veterans in Georgia (11,000 
persons), and also the Tbilisi Citizens' Union (the Tbiliso 
Society), which rendered Shevardnadze decisive support in the 
critical fall days of 1993. 
  The creation of the Citizens' Union has evoked harsh 
opposition criticism: Nodar Notadze, leader of the People's 
Front, called the new organization "red-brown" and claimed that 
its very existence is a threat to the foundations of Georgian 
democracy. I. Tsereteli, chairman of the National Independence 
Party, accused the Union's activists of a "betrayal of the 
interests of the motherland" and so forth. Georgiy Baramidze, 
deputy chairman of the SGG, treats such philippics with 
composure. He is convinced that only a large all-Georgia 
organization arranged along territorial lines is capable of 
universal constructive activity and can serve as a model of the 
future Georgian society; Baramidze surmised that the hour when 
Georgia once again values not an ability to shoot from an 
automatic weapon or juggle slogans but an ability to work with 
people is not far off. 
  The political situation in many republics of the former 
USSR, 
in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia primarily, confirms once 
again the old idea that public institutions and power structures 
that are optimal for European countries with a stable political 
culture could prove disastrous or ineffective for states that 
are experiencing an entirely different inheritance. Eduard 
Shevardnadze, the head of Georgia, is attempting to find ways of 
reining in the chaos without resorting to dictatorship here and 
without abandoning the gains of democracy, but he is constantly 
encountering difficulties connected with the moral state of 
society. Under these conditions only a policy capable of 
ensuring a synthesis of national tradition and the experience of 
the Soviet period and the mechanisms of government and values of 
the end of the 20th century could guarantee a way out of the 
crises.

<F P=106> [Statement by Patriarch Alexis II of Moscow and All Russia, </F>
17 February 1994, Moscow] 
  [Text] The armed conflict in Bosnia and Hercegovina has 
already been evoking great alarm throughout all of the Russian 
Orthodox Church for a long time. The numerous sacrifices borne 
by the warring sides, the grave sufferings of the peaceful 
population, the destruction of cities and towns and the demise 
of the habitat are the tragic consequences of the fratricidal 
war into which the peoples inhabiting this region have been 
drawn. 
  In May 1993 the Patriarch and Holy Synod of the Russian 
Orthodox Church issued a Statement on the Current Situation in 
the Territory of Former Yugoslavia. It in, we stated our empathy 
for the grave sufferings of the Serbian people, with whom we are 
tied by centuries-old knots of brotherhood and the one Orthodox 
faith, and our sympathy for the other peoples of former 
Yugoslavia--Catholics, Muslims and people without religion. "We 
appeal," this statement read, "to all leaders of peoples drawn 
into the armed conflict to immediately desist from military 
activities and go over to peaceful resolution of existing 
disputes through peaceful concessions. 
  "We pray and beseech these peoples, including the Serbian 
people, who are of one faith with us, to live in peace, and 
goodly concordance with one another. 
  "We beseech the world community to reject plans for armed 
intervention into the conflict, unilateral military support or 
unilateral economic blockade of any of the sides involved. 
  "We welcome all steps toward peace, no matter whence the 
come, and pray for their success." 
  However, to our deep regret the tragic situation that has 
evolved in relations between the warring sides has not yet 
experienced any radical positive changes. Moreover the ultimatum 
regarding plans by aviation of NATO countries to bomb Serbian 
fire positions at Sarajevo will unquestionably lead, in the 
event of implementation of these plans, to great human 
sacrifice, including deaths in the peaceful population, no 
matter what direction from which they are approached. The 
bombing may evoke the most unpredictable military and political 
consequences, and in and of itself, it would be an extremely 
dangerous precedent. 
  We appeal to all upon whom this depends not to permit such a 
dangerous development of events, and to reject the very idea of 
bombing. We must persistently seek a peaceful, and only a 
peaceful solution to the problem. On the road to this end, the 
warring units must withdraw their heavy armaments simultaneously 
and without delay, or place them under international control, so 
that the blockade of the city of Sarajevo could finally be 
lifted and so that humanitarian assistance could finally be 
delivered unhindered to its long-suffering population. 
  May the Lord shed wisdom upon all decision makers, and let 
them hear His voice, calling for peace and reconciliation. 
The Lord shall say peace to His people and to His chosen; 
yet let them not return to folly (Psalms 96, 9).

<F P=106> [Article by Mike Davidow: "Selfish Hypocrisy: Why the U.S. </F>
Government Supports the Pseudo-Reforms in Russia"] 
  [Text] My last trip to the United States put me in the 
position of the sole American correspondent in Moscow who had 
been in the House of Soviets (the Russian "White House") during 
the assault on it on the orders of Boris Yeltsin. When I and my 
wife Lena made our way out of the charred and blackened "White 
House," which had been shot up, I was greeted by a television 
cameraman of the ABC company. 
  "Hey, Mike," he shouted. "What was it like inside?" 
  I angrily told him. Never previously when I had returned 
home 
had the chief of ABC's Moscow bureau requested an on-the-spot 
interview. But that evening, as several days later also, 
millions of Americans saw the first witness to describe his 
vision from inside the House of Soviets building of the crime of 
the century blessed by our American president. 
  When I arrived in New York, therefore, there was already 
considerable interest in the true picture of what had happened 
in Moscow those tragic October days. And this was in direct 
contrast to what had been portrayed by the pro-Yeltsin news 
media on the payroll of American big business. 
  In San Francisco I saw full coverage of these events, some 
of 
which had been shown on Russian television also. President 
Yeltsin's shooting up of parliament with tank guns was presented 
to the American people as a forced response to the rebellion of 
"renegade legislators"! 
  Never prior to that particular time when I arrived in New 
York had WBAI Radio, which is popular in the United States, 
sought an interview with me. On this occasion the interest in me 
was enormous, and I was invited to take part in a 90-minute 
interview. More precisely, this was my dialogue with this 
station's Moscow stringer. 
  In San Francisco I was interviewed by the correspondent of 
another popular radio station--KPFA. And this interview also 
aroused great interest. Maria Glardin from the Media Center, 
which serves 40 radio stations of the United States, Canada, and 
New Zealand, conducted a two-hour interview with me. Thus, 
thanks to these television and radio appearances of mine, at 
least the Americans (not, alas, Russian people, who are informed 
by television and radio which is controlled by Yeltsin's team) 
were able to learn the truth about the bloody carnage in Moscow. 
  I spoke, in addition, at meetings in New York, Chicago, Gary 
(the center of the steel industry), San Francisco, and Los 
Angeles. And everywhere people were moved to the bottom of their 
hearts. And it was by no means a question of my eloquence. 
People were affected by the greatest tragedy of the 20th 
century, which Russia is experiencing, itself! Many of those in 
my audience had been to the Soviet Union. They had seen this 
country's sole privileged class--children. They had visited the 
practically free kindergarten and summer pioneer camps. They had 
made the acquaintance of students, who had not only acquired a 
free higher education but who were, in addition, being paid 
grants not devoured by hyperinflation. They had experienced such 
a blessing as the possibility of strolling the streets of Moscow 
at night without fear or risk. Some of them had been members of 
a delegation of working America at the May celebrations in Red 
Square. And now, not far from Red Square, officers and soldiers 
of the Soviet Army, which had been the admiration of the world 
and which had saved mankind from fascism, were participating in 
the slaughter of their own people! One elderly woman from San 
Francisco uttered words that are etched in my memory forever. 
She said: 
  "I saw on television how thousands of Muscovites looked on 
calmly as tanks shot up the parliament building. What has 
happened to Soviet people?" 
  This question awaits an answer from Russians themselves and 
other peoples of the former Soviet Union. And I believe that 
this answer will be forthcoming. I have attempted in my book 
"Perestroyka: Its Rise and Fall," which has just been published 
in the United States (the title of its Russian edition is "Quo 
Vadis, Rus?"), to provide an explanation for this. And we 
Americans also are required, in turn, to answer the just as 
painful question: 
  "How was it that the progressive community of the United 
States failed to raise its voice in protest against the evil 
deed perpetrated in Russia?" 
  And I have to emphasize particularly in answering these and 
similar questions that I have the most profound respect for the 
courageous defenders of the Russian parliament and Constitution. 
And I know that the majority even of those who avail themselves 
of information from the biased pro-Yeltsin publications feel 
that the whole truth concerning these events has far from been 
spoken as yet. Was this not why Yeltsin's supporters suffered a 
crushing defeat at the 12 December elections? And is this not a 
sign that the mass of the Russian people disagree with both the 
capitalization and the Americanization of their country? This 
was understood even by Senator Sam Nunn, the head of the 
influential Senate Armed Services Committee. He was very candid 
in his comments on what happened in Russia: 
  "The experience of the Russian people's familiarization with 
capitalism has convinced them that it is like the law of the 
jungle." 
  And the leading American weekly THE NATION was even more 
candid and curt: "Capitalism is returning to Russia up to its 
knees in blood" (25 October 1993). "Results of the elections in 
Russia: New image smashed to smithereens"--this was the heading 
that THE NEW YORK TIMES gave a report from Moscow on 15 December 
1993. 
  From all that I saw, I concluded that the Clinton 
administration will do everything in its power to impose 
capitalism on Russia. It has a dual purpose here: first, to 
strengthen capitalism in Russia, which means the complete 
eradication of socialism; second, to guarantee that Russia not 
surmount the disintegration imposed on it by the 
Yeltsin-Kravchuk-Shushkevich conspiracy. And this means 
primarily that the restoration of a renewed USSR will be 
prevented. With Yeltsin or without him (and U.S. imperialism 
recognizes that it will never have another chance), this is its 
main goal. 
  I believe that the Clinton administration understands the 
need for greater flexibility in its relations with the political 
forces in Russia. But it would be a serious delusion to confuse 
this flexibility with the main aim: the spread of the laws of 
the capitalist jungle to Russia and other former republics of 
the USSR. The Clinton administration has latched onto the 
impressive victory of Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party at 
the recent elections to start howling about the fascist threat 
in Russia. The hypocrisy of such a campaign is obvious. Where 
there were, indeed, real fascist-type threats expressed not in 
inflammatory words but in deeds--Yeltsin's violation of the 
effective Constitution, his dissolution of the Supreme Soviet 
and the Congress of People's Deputies, the shooting up of the 
House of Soviets, which cost the lives of at least 1,000 
persons--where were the U.S. statesmen then? Where was our 
American parliament when the Russian parliament was calling on 
it to speak out in defense of the rights of parliament and the 
Constitution? 
  As I can see, the ultranationalist and provocative rhetoric 
of Zhirinovskiy is playing into the hands of U.S. imperialism, 
providing cover for its aggressive policy. In actual fact, it is 
concerned by no means by the ultranationalism of Zhirinovskiy. 
It is intimidated by the growing patriotic movement against the 
collapse of the millennial Russian state, against the selling 
off of Russia bit by bit to the United States and Western 
capital. It is declaring a "threat" the legitimate aspiration to 
the restoration of a renewed USSR and to the defense of Russian 
national interests and the human rights of the 25 million 
Russian people who have become stateless persons. They [as 
published] are beating the drum, trumpeting the fascist threat 
in Russia to justify their high-handed interference in Russia's 
affairs (which, in turn, is fostering ultranationalism!). They 
are focusing attention on Zhirinovskiy in order that, in 
comparison with him, Yeltsin might look "good." 
  But it would be a mistake to underestimate both the danger 
of 
ultranationalism in Russia and the capacity of U.S. imperialism 
for using the provocative rhetoric of Zhirinovskiy to galvanize 
the myth of the "Russian threat." It should be remembered in 
this connection that the American people were fed the tale of 
the "Russian threat" for seven decades. 
  Finally, my trip to the United States enabled me to take 
part 
in the work of the National Leadership of the Communist Party of 
the United States when the international solidarity of the world 
communist movement was being debated. An appeal signed by Gus 
Hall, a veteran of the Communist Party and its leader, was 
adopted. It said, in particular: "We are well aware that our own 
imperialism creates a threat to peace, social progress, and 
national independence throughout the world....and their appetite 
has grown considerably in connection with the disintegration of 
the Soviet Union." Hall welcomed the recent regional meetings 
and the international symposium, but observed that it was not 
the high level of communist unity at which world realities had 
to be met. The question of the nature and causes of the 
opportunism that has eaten away at certain socialist societies 
also is on the agenda at these meetings. There was also an 
appeal for the discussion at the international level of the 
events occurring in Russia. As it said, "We are convinced of the 
durability and revival of the parties that the bourgeoisie has 
pronounced dead."

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Modestov under the rubric "Special </F>
Services": "CIA Director Presents Report to U.S. Senate 
Containing Undisclosed Secret Chapters: U.S. Intelligence 
Community Attentively Watching Russia and Other CIS Countries"] 
  [Text] Several unpleasant surprises sprung on us by fate 
not only during the period of the September-October crisis but 
also at the time of the December denouement, and the subsequent 
finger- pointing, prompted the Russian Federation president to 
comment quite disapprovingly on the quality of the 
information-analytical work of his immediate entourage. 
  Judging by all signs, he was not alone in his desire to be 
well informed on events in Russia. But while he does not have 
any particular choice and will have to turn to the same--or 
similar, in terms of professional level and motivation--experts, 
his foreign colleagues do not have to step on the banana peel 
twice and again trust what they hear from Moscow. 
  In the beginning the West, particularly the American 
leadership, cherished more than enough romantic hopes. For 
instance, Senator D. Moynihan (D) from New York state proposed 
in 1991 to abolish the Central Intelligence Agency and transfer 
its functions to the State Department. Although this quite 
radical proposal was not accepted, intelligence organs could not 
fail to sense that establishing new relations with their former 
main enemy does not improve their prospects for the future. 
  Very soon, however, the tentative "thaw" in the area of 
intelligence lost its urgency. It turned out that one cannot 
rely on the quality of information of the Russian side, even 
though it may be willing to share with the former opponents its 
appraisal of the situation in Russia and other republics of the 
former Union. 
  In this connection the U.S. President set CIA Director James 
Woolsey the task of boosting intelligence and 
information-gathering on Russia and the states of the former 
USSR. The result was a classified intelligence report analyzing 
the situation in critical points of the planet and an evaluation 
of the threat to U.S. interests emanating from there. A 
sanitized version of this report was presented on 25 January 
1994 at hearings in the Senate Intelligence Committee. As James 
Woolsey put it, the complete and original text of the report may 
only be presented to senators at a closed hearing. 
  Judging by all signs, it may contain: (a) characterization 
of 
the political and physical state of "first persons" of the main 
countries under intelligence evaluation, including the Russian 
Federation; (b) confidential estimates of the intentions and 
plans of these countries' leaderships; (c) information on plans 
for conducting intelligence activities, including mention of 
most sensitive active measures; (d) commentary on so-called 
"black programs" in the consolidated draft federal budget for 
the 1994-1995 fiscal year; (e) references to agent sources of 
most valuable information; and so on. 
  Actually, even the sanitized version of the report, which 
was 
quite voluminous (31 pages), was presented to the gathering only 
in the form of a summary. The other speaker--Defense 
Intelligence Agency Director Lieutenant General James 
Clapper--was in keeping with military tradition concise and 
limited himself to a document half as long (14 pages). 
  We will skip the parts of James Woolsey's report dealing 
with 
North Korea, China, Libya, Near and Middle East countries, 
Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti. We can also bypass the sections of 
the report dealing with the topic of international problems of 
proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons among 
developing countries, and the problems of combating terrorism 
and drugs. 
  What is worth looking at is Page 10 of the report presented, 
which covers the situation in Russia and other republics of the 
former USSR. 
  Analyzing the results of the December elections in our 
country, the CIA director first and foremost emphasized 
Russians' ambivalence. The new parliament elected in our country 
combines political forces that are more united in opposition to 
the old course of reforms than in the desire to make clear and 
constructive corrections to it. At the same time, it is obvious 
to the head of American intelligence that the voters supported 
the expansion of President Yeltsin's constitutional powers, and 
this is precisely what could guarantee consistent continuation 
of the reform. James Woolsey also noted that the Russian 
leadership is aware of the hopes of all electoral groups 
(regardless of political orientation) for increased social 
protection of the population and the securing of proper public 
order. 
  Next, James Woolsey outlined four basic directions of 
intelligence and information-gathering work with respect to 
Russia. 
  First, providing decisionmakers with the most 
important and sometimes unique information of a political and 
economic nature in order to be able, in an environment of high 
uncertainty, to warn them of the risks they may encounter in 
relations with Russia. While giving credit to what has already 
been done on the road of far- reaching socioeconomic reforms, 
James Woolsey pointed out that it is still unclear when the 
subsidizing of unprofitable industrial and agricultural 
enterprises will cease. Nevertheless, he expressed the hope that 
our president will continue the reforms that are already 
underway, although perhaps at a somewhat different pace (if this 
may provide sufficient grounds for compromise with his critics). 
The most important part, the CIA director continued, is to make 
sure that a softer finance and credit policy aimed at 
attenuating the pain of the reform does not untie the hands of 
those who will push the country into the abyss of hyperinflation. 
  Second, the plan is to continue surveillance of 
places of deployment and the status of approximately 27,000 of 
our nuclear warheads, as well as the means of their delivery. In 
this respect the greatest concern on the American side is the 
decline in esprit de corps in armed forces ranks. This appears 
especially dangerous in light of the provocational approaches 
undertaken by some countries with the aim of getting their hands 
on samples of the most important weapons and military equipment 
and nuclear technology and materials. Intelligence-gathering 
activities in this area will be combined with practical help to 
our side in ensuring the necessary physical security of nuclear 
weapons and fissionable materials. 
  Third, American intelligence intends to continue 
monitoring our general-purpose forces. The CIA director already 
reported in 1993 on the state of these types of Russian armed 
forces, which are experiencing serious difficulties in providing 
their commissioned personnel with housing, decent cash pay, and 
supporting the needed moral and psychological state of mind of 
servicemen. As James Woolsey correctly noted, the Russian 
military does not have any special immunity and suffers equally 
from the political, economic, and social adversity in which our 
reforming country is so rich. 
  Fourth, the CIA is concerned over the development 
of relations between Russia and its new independent neighbors, 
which until recently comprised a unified Soviet Union. The 
presence of 25 million Russian-speaking people outside Russian 
borders, as well as the economic interconnection and 
interdependence of the former Union republics, which developed 
historically and in many instances naturally, are seen by the 
report's authors as key factors determining the evolution of 
their policy. 
  In this connection the presenter dwelled at length on 
Russian- Ukrainian relations, particularly the problem of 
Crimea. Woolsey informed committee members of the CIA forecast 
regarding the outcome of presidential elections on the 
peninsula, which were to take place five days later--on 30 
January. The subsequent development of events confirmed the 
American analysts' conclusions. Later, Langley experts predict 
increasing instability in this region, exacerbated by the 
worsening general economic situation in Ukraine. They view as 
quite probable new attempts to involve Russia in a resolution of 
the Crimean problem, which will inevitably affect the state of 
Russian- Ukrainian relations. 
  Concluding his chapter on Russia, which accounted for about 
10-15 percent of the total volume (approximately the same amount 
of space was allocated to Ukraine and other republics of the 
former USSR), James Woolsey reminded the senators that the 
political system that existed in our country for several decades 
has left a perceptible imprint on Russian society. Therefore it 
should come as no surprise that this legacy will be felt for 
many years to come in the form of some or other crisis both in 
Russia proper and among its immediate neighbors. 
  Let us sum up. It was not at all our task to present the 
viewpoint of expert analysts from the CIA or the U.S. Defense 
Department intelligence arm as the most faithful reflection of 
the real situation in Russia and the most convincing picture of 
our immediate future prospects. And the reason is not a priori 
suspiciousness stemming from lopsided professional thinking. 
While the American special services' approach is thorough, they 
have a long way to go to achieve a deep understanding of the 
substance of events taking place here, which is quite excusable 
in intercultural interaction of such different social formations. 
  The resultant mutual cognitive dissonance represents an 
academic and practical problem that should be interpreted by 
theoreticians and methodologists of intelligence services of 
both countries within the framework of the dialogue between 
American and Russian special services that has been developing 
lately. 
  This is why, acting at the very least from a desire to 
better 
understand the position of American experts and even more so in 
order to react usefully, some (or better still, all) 
observations of our counterparts can and should be perceived, 
weighed, and evaluated with due attention and without any 
partisan bias in research units of Russian special services. 
Which is made easier by the fact that they are now directly 
subordinated to the president, who is above all branches, above 
the political ambitions of some or other groups. This at least 
partially exempts our analysts from a prejudiced, biased 
approach. 
  The latter assumption may perhaps be a little optimistic and 
does not square well with the harsh opinion presented at the 
beginning of the article. But the intellectual and moral 
potential of Russian intelligence officers and the presumption 
of their loyalty to their civic duty give one the right to hope 
for it. 
  There are also other applied aspects in the detailed study 
of 
an outside view of Russian reality. For example, this may enable 
us to better understand the American reality and to have a 
better picture of the potential attitude toward us in the 
highest echelons of state power in the United States.

<F P=106> [Article by Marat Salimov and Konstantin Smirnov: "The </F>
Ministry Has Prepared a Trade Code"] 
  [Text] The former union republics are still Russia's 
main partners in trade and in cooperative production, but the 
mechanisms and instruments for the regulation of economic 
relations between the CIS countries are still not securing their 
completely effective development. According to the heads of 
Minsotrudnichestvo [Ministry of Economic Cooperation with 
Commonwealth States], the improvement of the laws and treaties 
serving as the basis of interstate trade and financial relations 
will be fostered by "The Rules of Trade Operations with 
Commonwealth States and the Baltic Countries," a report which 
was prepared by the ministry and was sent to embassies in the 
CIS states yesterday. It defines the present conditions and 
procedures of trade and settlements within the CIS 
framework. 
  The report the specialists from the Russian 
Minsotrudnichestvo prepared at the beginning of 1994 is an 
analytical resource document and is intended fueaprimarily to 
notify businessmen in the CIS countries of the procedure for 
carrying out trade operations and mutual settlements. In 
addition, the report provides a complete description of the 
present mechanism for the regulation of foreign trade, 
cooperative, and financial relations in the CIS and the Baltic 
countries. Throughout 1993 the Russian Minsotrudnichestvo 
repeatedly had to carry out the functions of the Commonwealth's 
interstate economic agencies and took on virtually all of the 
responsibility for drafting multilateral agreements. The report 
not only sums up the results of the efforts of government 
agencies in the CIS countries to establish the necessary 
conditions for the development of integration, but also points 
out ways of improving the laws and treaties lying at the basis 
of these processes in 1994. 
  The report consists of 10 main sections, which cover all of 
the main areas and objectives of economic relations between the 
CIS countries. The most highly developed mechanism is the one 
regulating trade between Russia and the Commonwealth countries. 
In 1994, however, it will undergo some adjustments. The changes 
are intended mainly to establish stricter control over exports 
of Russian goods to CIS countries for the purpose of preventing 
their re-export. Besides this, there will be stricter control 
over Russian imports of goods from the former republics of the 
USSR. The purpose of these changes is stringent control over the 
origin of imported goods. It is no secret that some goods from 
Western Europe and the United States are now being brought into 
Russia through the CIS countries, which can allow for the 
avoidance of customs duties in the absence of strict controls 
over the country of origin. 
  The terms of foreign trade operations with the CIS countries 
will become more inflexible in some respects (by means of 
stricter control), but the changes will also result in their 
comparative liberalization. The list of goods requiring quotas 
and licenses for shipment from Russia to the Commonwealth 
countries will be reduced to 14 categories in 1994. 
  In contrast to the present procedure, all settlements 
between 
Russia and the Commonwealth countries will be made through the 
payment and credit center of the Russian Central Bank and 
through commercial banks. Funds transferred to the payee, 
however, will have to come from a correspondent account in a 
bank in the paying country. With this mechanism, which does not 
envisage mutual currency conversion, mutual settlements between 
enterprises in the CIS countries will be much more complicated 
and will take longer. The report says that some positive changes 
in this area could result from the establishment of the 
Interstate Bank, which should begin conducting settlement 
operations in a multilateral clearing network in the second half 
of 1994. If this bank is entrusted with the necessary powers, it 
could serve as an instrument to control the circulation of money 
and securities throughout the CIS. The Interstate Bank's ability 
to perform its functions will depend, however, on the creation 
of a CIS payment union, based on a single mechanism for 
coordinated national currency exchange rate quotations. 
  [Box] 
<H3>  Forms of Settlement and Terms of Payment Between Russia and 
CIS Countries </H3>
  All settlements will be made through the settlement and 
credit center of the Russian Central Bank and through commercial 
banks. 
  Transfers of payments will be limited to the funds available 
in a correspondent account in a bank in the paying country. 
  Settlements will be made in accordance with international 
and 
banking practice (payment authorizations, payment demands, and 
letters of credit). 
  [Box] 
<H5>  Terms of Russia's Trade with CIS Countries </H5>
  Shipments of goods from CIS countries to Russia will be 
exempt from import duties, value-added tax, and excise tax. 
  Russian exports of goods originating in CIS countries will 
also be exempt from all types of taxes and duties, with the 
exception of a few types of commodities (mainly strategic raw 
materials). 
  Russia's trade with CIS countries on a mutual noncash 
settlement basis in 1994 will be regulated by bilateral 
intergovernmental agreements. 
  Quotas and licenses for Russian exports to Commonwealth 
countries will apply to only 14 of the most vital crude 
resources and materials in 1994. 
  Starting on 1 January 1994 the exporter of Russian goods 
shipped to CIS countries will be obligated to submit a 
"transaction passport" to customs agencies for the export of 
critical raw materials, and starting on 1 March this passport 
will be required for all goods exported from the territory of 
the Russian customs zone.

<F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Portnikov: "Power of Individuals or the </F>
Face of Power?: Sketches for Political Portraits"] 
  [Text] My article "The Federation Council: Face of the 
Federation or the Power of Individuals," which was presented by 
the editorial office as an attempt at a political portrait of 
the then leaders of the former Soviet republics, appeared in 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. Truly historic changes have occurred since 
that time both in our lives and in the biographies of the 
politicians introduced in that publication: The Soviet Union has 
disappeared, its leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, has departed 
politics, and new independent states, which have formed the CIS, 
have appeared. But many of the leaders of that time have held on 
to power, albeit in a new capacity. And whereas previously we 
asked whether the familiar "face of power" in the Soviet Union 
would not become the power of individuals, now this question 
itself is different: Can the power of individuals in the 
post-Soviet space be composed of a "face of power" not united 
under a communal roof but capable of consulting, reaching 
agreement, and seeking and finding real compromises in the 
tangled relations between the new independent states? 
<H6>  Yeltsin </H6>
  The election of Boris Yeltsin as the first chairman of the 
CIS may, of course, be considered up to a certain point a purely 
symbolic gesture and a display of support on the part of his 
colleagues. His function can in no way be compared with the 
chairmanship of Mikhail Gorbachev in the Federation Council or 
even in the far more independent USSR State Council. But in a 
whole number of instances--we recall the economic situation in 
Ukraine, the war in Georgia, the Dniester conflict in Moldova, 
the Karabakh confrontation of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the 
collapse of the "new-type ruble zone" for Kazakhstan and 
Uzbekistan--the influence of the Russian leadership on the 
affairs of countries of the Commonwealth has all but exceeded 
the influence of the former Soviet leadership on the 
possibilities of the Union republics. For this reason Yeltsin's 
chairmanship does not today appear purely incidental. But 
Russia's policy in relation to the former Soviet republics 
remains sufficiently unpredictable. Russian leaders--primarily 
the president--are constantly torn between political necessity 
and economic expediency. On the one hand there is evidence of a 
desire to preserve the entire former Soviet space as a "zone of 
influence," on the other, the measures of economic stimulation, 
necessary in these cases, of countries in no hurry over their 
reforms are beginning to objectively contradict the interests of 
the Russian economic reform. The most striking example here was 
Russia's refusal to remit to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan cash in 
new-denomination rubles after the accords on the creation of a 
new-type ruble zone had been signed. The situation in which 
Russia had found itself was precisely described at that time by 
Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev: "As an economist, I can 
understand the ministers of economics or finance of Russia. But 
they should confer with the people responsible for Russia's 
geopolitical interests." 
  Boris Yeltsin is one such person. But he has to take account 
not only of the logic constructs of the economic structures but 
also the desires of the power structures, which submit to no 
political logic--the president is too dependent on them in 
domestic policy to go against them in foreign policy, in the 
"near abroad" particularly. I would recall if only the assault 
on Sukhumi, which impressed the world, by Abkhaz formations, 
which not only were not stopped by the military of Russia--the 
guarantor of the fulfillment of the well-known Georgian-Abkhaz 
agreements which disarmed the Georgian Army--but were in fact 
supported by the former. Even, possibly, contrary to the wishes 
of a president of Russia unduly preoccupied at this time with 
his confrontation with the Supreme Soviet. 
  Now Boris Yeltsin has once again found himself faced with 
the 
need to make a choice in his "Commonwealth" policy. The success 
of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's party at the parliamentary elections 
demonstrated pretty well the kind of success revanchist 
sentiments are enjoying in Russian society. 
  And the president also is facing the obvious temptation not 
so much to follow in the wake of Zhirinovskiy's views as to 
justify all of Russia's stern actions in relation to countries 
of the CIS by the existence of the chauvinist phenomenon. Some 
recent statements of the president's closest advisers, including 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, show that this could be a 
perfectly acceptable direction in foreign policy. And then the 
sole "lever" of influencing Russian policy left to Boris 
Yeltsin's colleagues would be the telephone. Or, at best, 
personal contacts. After all, thus far all problems between 
Russia and the CIS countries have been resolved only at 
presidential level--a pretty good illustration of the 
abnormality of these relations, frozen, as it were, at the level 
of the old fissures in Gorbachev's Federation Council and 
incapable yet of switching to the level of normal interstate 
relations. 
<H6>  Nazarbayev </H6>
  The president of Kazakhstan, whose nonparticipation in the 
celebrated Belovezha meeting is still explained variously by the 
leaders of the former Soviet republics, has become the main 
spokesman, virtually, for integration ideas in the CIS. It was 
Nazarbayev who proposed and decisively supported the creation of 
coordinating bodies of the Commonwealth and the economic union 
of its members. But the president of Kazakhstan has 
simultaneously endeavored insistently to build a truly sovereign 
and real state in a republic with a more than complex ethnic 
makeup (the most complex in the former Union, probably, not 
counting tiny Latvia, which is protected as yet against possible 
demographic problems by the rules of international law). The 
building of Kazakhstani statehood has required as an essential 
condition the tolerant attitude of the Russian leadership toward 
this complex historical experiment against the former's own 
will: after all, Kazakhstan was the last of the former Soviet 
republics to proclaim independence, and its president 
consistently supported, as long as this was possible, the 
preservation and reform of the Union. But when Kazakhstani 
statehood came to be suffused with real political and economic 
content and the country began to take the first independent 
steps in foreign policy, a cooling suddenly ensued in 
Kazakhstani-Russian relations--and hardly through the fault of 
Almaty. The refusal to transfer rubles in cash, charges of an 
attempt to create an alternative economic union of 
Turkic-speaking countries, the endeavor of certain Russian 
politicians--from both government circles and the opposition--to 
act the part of defenders of the Russian-speaking 
population--all this also influenced, of course, Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's positions in respect to the CIS. In any event, 
reports of Kazakhstan's promotion of initiatives at the Ashgabat 
meeting have remained unconfirmed, but the president of this 
republic engaged in heavy diplomatic activity, taking advantage 
of the last "summit" for productive bilateral contacts, with his 
recent "antipode" in the Commonwealth--Leonid 
Kravchuk--included. A charming and strong politician, Nazarbayev 
can today, without putting his popularity in the republic 
particularly at risk, distance himself from Russia somewhat, 
offering society certain alternative paths of development and 
alternative partners even. But these steps of Kazakhstan could 
be more a reaction to Moscow's misunderstanding of Almaty's 
aspiration to build equal relations protected against 
speculation on the most painful topic for Kazakhstan--the 
possibility of interethnic misunderstanding. It should be 
mentioned also that the Kazakhstan president's distancing of 
himself somewhat from Russia could help him in the struggle for 
influence in the Central Asia region, where Almaty's positions 
have been weakened somewhat--compared with those of Tashkent--in 
connection with the Tajik events. In addition, on the eve of 
parliamentary elections such a policy could reduce the chances 
of Nazarbayev's opponents from Kazakh national parties, who are 
accusing him of failing to understand Kazakhstan's true 
interests. 
<H6>  Kravchuk </H6>
  Whereas until recently the presidents of Russia and 
Kazakhstan were considered the main proponents of the 
integration line in the CIS, the president of Ukraine was 
described, as a rule, as a supporter of a different approach to 
the Commonwealth, as the most felicitous instrument for the 
"divorce" of the former Soviet republics. But time has adjusted 
both the position of Yeltsin and Nazarbayev and the position of 
Kravchuk: The CIS could not either be a practicable instrument 
for the integration of its members or secure for them a normal 
divorce. The distance at which this country or the other stands 
from the Commonwealth was more a political section than a 
measure of true integration or disintegration desires. And it is 
striking here that the strong political position of the 
president of Ukraine has not been founded on real economic 
possibilities, which has led in Russian-Ukrainian relations, for 
example, to humiliating concessions, which President Kravchuk 
himself has called "kneeling." 
  The attitude of the president of Ukraine toward the CIS is 
conditioned primarily by the state of the relations of Ukraine 
and Russia, and these relations depend directly on the ailing, 
unreformed Ukrainian economy. On the eve of early parliamentary 
and presidential elections in the country it is the economic 
crisis which has propelled to the forefront the question of 
stable Ukrainian statehood. For President Kravchuk himself--as 
for Ukraine also, for that matter--the best option at the 
present time would appear to be the abandonment of presidential 
elections after the parliamentary elections with a strengthening 
of the vertical line of the executive. But Leonid Kravchuk could 
achieve this cancellation only with the start of a real, even if 
not all that significant, change in the economy or, on the other 
hand, with an extraordinary exacerbation of the situation. Both 
versions are hardly realistic, and it may be assumed, therefore, 
that the Ukrainian president will simply attempt to find a 
common language with the new parliament, and the composition of 
this parliament will determine his tactics in relations with 
Russia and the CIS as a whole. The only thing that should not be 
expected from Kravchuk is the fulfillment of the cherished dream 
of certain radical Russian politicians from the "revanche 
party"--a change of the blue and yellow flag for a white one. 
Leonid Kravchuk has invested too much in his image as the 
architect of new Ukrainian independence to retreat from it. The 
combination of the success of this political image and the 
economic apathy is altogether, most likely, the determining 
phenomenon of the "sovereign-communist" success, which is not 
typical of just Kravchuk alone. 
<H6>  Shushkevich </H6>
  An architect of the CIS and until the day before yesterday 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich 
had since the first months of the Commonwealth's existence, 
virtually, been in a dual position. On the one hand, against the 
background of the other leaders of the former Soviet republics 
Shushkevich appeared to be the politician who most aspired to 
preserve Union integration and even some special relationship 
with Russia. But at the same time Shushkevich aspired also to 
"preserve character," ensuring for the proclaimed Belorussian 
sovereignty if only an attributive existence. And it was here 
that Shushkevich encountered in his own republic the opposition 
of the "economic party" headed by Prime Minister Vyacheslav 
Kebich, and it is Kebich's policy, not that of Shushkevich, 
which has of late gained the support of the majority of members 
of parliament, what is more. And Shushkevich--not president but 
chairman of the Supreme Soviet--had to come to terms with this 
trend, which has already led to his dismissal from office. 
Meanwhile, the struggle for power in Minsk and the hope of the 
executive that closer cooperation with Russia will make it 
possible not to reform the republic's economy have led to 
Belarus' loss of its advantageous mediating role in the CIS. 
<H6>  Karimov </H6>
  During the events in Tajikistan Islam Karimov, who 
intervened 
in the conflict decisively and facilitated the accession to 
power of the present Tajik leadership headed by Emomali 
Rakhmanov, succeeded in showing that his claims to leadership in 
the region may not be simply declarative. But it is indicative 
that Karimov has subsequently tried to distance himself from the 
Tajik conflict, demonstrating hereby that his decisive steps may 
alternate with quite cautious tactics. This is connected to some 
extent with the fact that the Uzbek economy, which is living 
merely with the expectation of possible energy dividends, cannot 
allow itself a free sail and to some extent with the president's 
concerns for a strengthening of his own power, which does not 
contemplate lengthy involvement in so dangerous a conflict as 
the Tajik conflict. In addition, left by Russia without cash in 
rubles, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, traditional rivals, have 
simply been forced to draw closer to one another, and Karimov 
has inquired in earnest about the prospects of regional 
integration: Tajikistan and Turkmenistan will hardly be active 
participants, but a commonwealth of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and 
Kyrgyzstan could produce tangible geopolitical results. At the 
same time it has to be recalled that observers were expecting of 
the experienced and cautious Karimov greater flexibility in 
domestic policy, considering that there was little that in fact 
threatened the power of the president of Uzbekistan. But Islam 
Karimov has preferred to rule his country quite strictly, 
obviously believing that the stability that has been achieved is 
the best proof of the soundness of the tactics for which he has 
opted. But it is hard to judge as yet how durable stability in 
any republic of Central Asia will be and to what extent 
presidential power can hold back uncontrollable social 
processes, especially if they have support from abroad. 
<H6>  Shevardnadze </H6>
  One of the best known and most consummate politicians on the 
territory of the former Union, Eduard Shevardnadze has found 
himself the head of a country paralyzed by sporadic civil war, 
interethnic conflicts, and the amateurish leadership of Georgia 
by the predecessors and associates of Gorbachev's foreign 
minister. Of course, the situation in which Georgia finds itself 
has been the main obstacle to the application of Shevardnadze's 
diplomatic capabilities, especially since--on account of the 
relative independence of many of the players in the Russian 
political arena--the policy of the Georgian leader oriented 
toward a search for honest and mutually acceptable accords with 
Russia has as yet proven bankrupt. A politician of any other 
rank could hardly have retained power after the loss of Sukhumi, 
but Shevardnadze succeeded under these conditions in offering 
stereotypes of political consciousness and leading Georgia into 
the CIS. The Ashgabat meeting was essentially the Georgian 
leader's debut in the Commonwealth, but Eduard Shevardnadze 
succeeded at this "summit" even in demonstrating that he will 
hardly be a passive observer here: Shevardnadze's interlocutors 
in the Turkmen capital, who subsequently met among themselves, 
included Leonid Kravchuk and Nursultan Nazarbayev, Geydar 
Aliyev, Islam Karimov.... Despite his country's calamitous 
situation, Shevardnadze is prepared, it would seem, to employ if 
only his personal possibilities for a change in the 
apportionment of forces in the Commonwealth which could help 
Georgia consolidate its positions in the post-Soviet space. 
<H6>  Aliyev </H6>
  The return to power in Azerbaijan of Geydar Aliyev is a no 
less fascinating story than the political biography of Eduard 
Shevardnadze. And one further example of the fact that 
representatives of the old Soviet school who went through the 
"fire and water" of the Brezhnev Politburo even can give the 
representatives of the national movements who campaigned for the 
independence of the former Soviet republics far more actively 
than the party secretaries a 100-point lead. Eduard 
Shevardnadze, of course, showed his capabilities as a politician 
not so much as head of the Communist Party of Georgia Central 
Committee but as... foreign minister of the USSR and in the 
exercise of foreign policy perestroyka. But Geydar Aliyev also, 
after his departure from the office of first vice premier of the 
Soviet Union, demonstrated his political capabilities, heading 
the Supreme Assembly of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. As 
the head of Nakhichevan, an enclave situated between Turkey and 
an Armenia essentially at war with Azerbaijan, Aliyev was able 
to prevent hostilities on his territory, find a common language 
with Ankara, which sympathized with his political antagonist 
President Elchibey, and even to establish contacts with Yerevan. 
But once in Baku, Aliyev, like Shevardnadze in Tbilisi, came in 
for a difficult inheritance: A country with pretty good 
political possibilities had found itself threatened with 
military defeat, and it was simply essential that the new 
president show himself to be a far more moderate and 
peace-loving politician than his predecessor. Aliyev is 
endeavoring--and he will continue this policy--to wrest the 
foreign policy initiative from Yerevan, drawing closer to 
Russia--and Azerbaijan's return to the CIS was a feature of this 
rapprochement. But the Azerbaijan leader's Russian partners 
asked, it would seem, too high a price for assistance to Baku, 
and for this reason Aliyev has had to make use of his 
long-standing contacts and the disagreements in the Russian 
leadership. It is possible that the fate of the Azerbaijan 
leader will depend, for all that, not on success at the 
negotiating table but on military victories, and the forces 
outside of Azerbaijan that would like to preserve Geydar Aliyev 
must make efforts for the appearance of such victories. 
<H6>  Ter-Petrosyan </H6>
  The Armenian president remains today the sole leader 
throughout the post-Soviet space (not counting Estonia and, to 
some extent, Latvia) who was able to come to power from an 
informal democratic structure and, in addition, to keep his 
office and remain quite an authoritative leader, albeit one who 
has been experiencing certain difficulties as of late. This may 
to some extent be explained by the dire situation in which 
warring Armenia has found itself (but this is at the same time 
fertile ground for a frequent change of leaders as well) and 
also, to some extent, by the economically powerful "power party" 
which has formed around the president, but mainly by the 
outstanding diplomatic talent of Ter-Petrosyan, who has been 
able to so correct the initially anti-Moscow course of Armenian 
geopolitical strategy that he has easily and imperceptibly made 
Armenia the main base of Russia's interests in the Transcaucasus 
region--a role that has subsequently and with less success been 
sought by the Shevardnadze-headed Georgia and the Aliyev-led 
Azerbaijan. It was this policy that enabled Yerevan to change 
the correlation of forces in the Karabakh conflict (and there 
was simultaneously a change of power in Baku also, which reduced 
somewhat Turkey's influence on the situation in the region) and 
which at the same time has not in the least prevented 
constitutional development in Armenia--a country divided by 
borders. Of course, this successful conduct of foreign policy 
matters is smoothing over somewhat in the eyes of the public the 
economic disarray--it is usually ascribed to circumstances, not 
the president. But Levon Ter-Petrosyan will soon once again be 
encountering a situation where Russia is attempting to help both 
Armenia and Azerbaijan. And all too much here will depend on 
Yerevan itself, its economic and military potential, and the 
level of its influence on the leadership of Russia. 
<H6>  Snegur </H6>
  Like many other former Soviet republics, Moldova was faced 
with the threat of a paralysis of power, which led to the 
announcement of early parliamentary elections. Under these 
conditions President Mircea Snegur, whose positions had been 
somewhat shaken, once again becomes the sole realistic guarantor 
not only of the continuity of power but also of the state 
integrity of Moldova: In any event, the presidential elections 
were held on a larger territory than that on which the 
parliamentary elections will be held. 
  In addition, for the first time the president of Moldova, 
Mircea Snegur, was elected by a parliament representing the 
entire population of the republic, which is today in fact 
divided into three parts. The president's position is being 
improved also by the radicals from the Christian Democratic 
People's Front of Moldova demanding the republic's immediate 
affiliation to Romania. Thus Snegur occupies a certain 
intermediate, even center, position between the radicals in 
Chisinau and the separatist leaders in Tiraspol justifying the 
preservation of the self-proclaimed Dniester Moldavian Republic 
on territory controlled by Russian troops by the possibility of 
affiliation to Romania. But after the parliamentary elections, 
the president's positions could once again be in jeopardy: The 
new corps of deputies could perfectly well nominate from their 
ranks politicians who cleave to views similar to his, but who 
are not burdened by the legacy of confrontation with the 
rebellious regions of the republic. The return to Moldova's 
political life of its former leader Petru Lucinschi, who was 
elected chairman of the republic's parliament, is the best 
example of this. The president of Moldova's chance of retaining 
his authority will depend directly on a settlement of the 
Dniester conflict, which, in turn, will depend on relations with 
Russia and Moldova's role in the CIS (although the republic's 
parliament has yet to ratify the agreement on the formation of 
the Commonwealth, and this will have to be done by the new corps 
of deputies: Chisinau is meanwhile occupying a cautious-neutral 
position in relation to the CIS structures). It should be 
recalled also that the situation in Moldova and the 
possibilities of President Snegur have been influenced as of 
late by a new, "extra-Commonwealth" factor too: Moscow's search 
for "new old" spheres of influence in East Europe could force 
the Russian leaders to decide on certain concessions to 
Romania--and one such concession could be a Dniester settlement. 
<H6>  Niyazov </H6>
  Undisputed diplomatic talent and an ability to sensitively 
catch current political winds helped the president of 
Turkmenistan not only establish full and uncontested control 
over the republic--none of his CIS colleagues can rival the 
extent of his powers, and even the highest representative body 
is essentially appointed by Niyazov--but also to mothball social 
and political processes in Turkmenistan, preventing not Kyrgyz 
pluralism but even the Uzbek "representative" opposition. 
Turkmenistan has remained the sole former Soviet republic that 
has no opposition (except, perhaps, at the "dissident" level of 
the 1970's) and where the population might think that the 
president has succeeded by way of the abandonment of "democratic 
experiments" in securing for Turkmenistan political and economic 
stability expressed in control over social life and the 
preservation of the ration-card distribution of basic 
necessities. The niche of communist ideology was rapidly 
occupied by the "ideology of presidential authority": Niyazov is 
called Turkmenbashi, "Father of the Turkmen," and monuments to 
and large-scale portraits of the president, after whom the city 
formerly called Krasnovodsk, streets, schools, agricultural 
enterprises, and plants have been named, have appeared 
throughout the republic. The president's contributions and the 
nationwide love for him are reported daily by the Turkmen press 
and Turkmenistan radio and television. Saparmurad Niyazov is, 
meanwhile, making skillful use of the attraction not only of his 
own population but of the leadership of Russia also to 
stability: While remaining at a distance from the CIS and not 
participating in the work of a number of structures of the 
Commonwealth, Turkmenistan nonetheless maintains a special 
relationship with Russia and was even the first former Soviet 
republic to which President Yeltsin paid an official visit. 
Strict control over the republic is permitting President Niyazov 
to easily consent to Russian initiatives which could prove 
dangerous and even insulting to his president colleagues who do 
not have such command over the wishes of each citizen of theirs: 
Thus Turkmenistan is as yet the sole republic of the former 
Union to have signed a dual-citizenship agreement with Russia. 
At the same time Niyazov is actively seeking alternative paths 
for economic development outside of the CIS, endeavoring to 
develop contacts with Turkmenistan's neighbors in the East. But 
the absence of serious economic reforms preventing real use 
being made of the profits from the sale of natural gas could 
make the Turkmen leadership more dependent on Russia than 
President Niyazov would like. 
<H6>  Akayev </H6>
  Of all the presidents of countries of the Central Asia 
region, Askar Akayev is as yet in the most difficult and 
vulnerable position. A former president of the republic's 
Academy of Sciences, who became head of Kyrgyzstan in defiance, 
seemingly, of the logic of the development of the region (and, 
possibly, thanks also to the weakness of the then leadership 
headed by Absamat Masaliyev), Akayev simply had to come across 
as a supporter of an approach--pluralist--to the relations of 
power and society which was entirely different from that of 
neighboring countries. At the same time a hierarchy of regional 
elites traditional for Central Asia has been preserved in 
Kyrgyzstan, the Communist Party, which was banned earlier, has 
been revived, and a profound crisis has been observed within the 
power party itself, which has been expressed, in particular, in 
a change of prime minister of the republic and the resignation 
of Vice President Feliks Kulov, one of the country's most 
popular politicians. Askar Akayev's decision to hold a 
referendum on confidence in the president testifies to a desire 
for a radical solution of this crisis. But even should Akayev 
succeed, it will hardly be possible to get through the period of 
economic difficulties without recourse, if not to authoritarian 
methods of government, then at least to elements of an 
authoritarian approach. Specially since the cooling in relations 
between Moscow and Almaty is creating additional difficulties 
for Bishkek, which has traditionally been oriented toward these 
two capitals, and making Akayev even more dependent on the 
development trends of the countries of Central Asia. 
<H6>  Rakhmonov </H6>
  Emomali Rakhmonov, chairman of the Supreme Council of 
Tajikistan, can hardly look forward to a lengthy political 
biography. And it is not only a question here of the traditions 
of the new Tajikistan, which has already replaced several 
leaders, as of the nonindependence of the accession to power of 
Emomali Rakhmonov, which was a consequence of the bloody civil 
war and the manifest interest of a whole number of outside 
forces in such an outcome. But Rakhmonov is opposed not only by 
members of the opposition whom he vanquished but has not 
subjugated and who are being held in check thus far by the 
presence in Tajikistan and on its borders of the Russian Army. 
Profound contradictions are lacerating also the "party of 
victors" itself, which has proven to be extremely heterogeneous. 
Initially the nomenklatura from Leninabad and Kulyab, which had 
returned to power, tried to get rid of the field commanders who 
aspired to command it: The culmination of this termination of 
combatants who had played their part was the surprise death of 
Sangak Safarov, leader of the People's Front and former 
criminal. The new round of contradictions--between 
representatives of Leninabad, who had traditionally governed in 
Soviet Tajikistan, and the new leaders from Kulyab, whose 
protege Rakhmonov is--ended in the dismissal of the experienced 
Leninabader premier Abdumalik Abdulladzhanov. But a further 
strengthening of the Kulyabis is fraught with the danger of a 
new blowup of the situation in the republic, a change in the 
correlation of political forces, and even the loss of some of 
the outside support essential to the present bosses of Dushanbe. 
Because there has once again come to be a Leninabader in the 
premier's chair, and for this reason Emomali Rakhmonov, the 
leader of a country with a paralyzed economy, finances 
controlled by the central component of Russia, and an army 
subordinate to Moscow, can hardly feel confident. 
  Such, in brief, might be notes in the margins of the 
political biographies of the people today determining the 
development of the situation in the former Soviet republics. Of 
course, it is impossible to encompass the entire post-Union 
space, it has both "external" and "internal" dimensions 
incorporating, in addition, a whole number of leaders also. The 
"external" dimension means the leaders of the Baltic countries, 
which have already distanced themselves from their Union 
neighbors: Algirdas Brazauskas, Guntis Ulmanis and Valdis 
Birkavs, and Lennart Meri and Mart Laar. It means the leaders of 
self-proclaimed formations, by no means neophytes on the 
post-Soviet political stage, such as the leaders of Karabakh, 
Igor Smirnov, president of the Dniester region, or Vladislav 
Ardzinba, chairman of the parliament of Abkhazia, and Torez 
Kulumbegov, head of South Ossetia. We could also recall here 
Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of Chechnya, but we would hereby be 
moving not only toward the borders of Russia but also toward the 
boundaries of the "internal" dimension: the leaders of the 
Russian republics that participated in the work of Gorbachev's 
Federation Council have been eliminated from activity in the 
CIS. But the role of these leaders in the political life of 
Russia has by no means diminished but has, rather, increased 
since that time. Today their activity--that of the presidents of 
Tatarstan, Mintimer Shaymiyev, Bashkortostan, Murtaza Rakhimov, 
Yakutia, Mikhail Nikolayev, Chuvashia, Nikolay Fedorov, 
Ingushetia, Ruslan Aushev, Kabardino-Balkaria, Valeriy Kokov, 
and Mari El, Valeriy Zotin, the chairmen of the parliaments of 
Karelia, Viktor Stepanov, and Mordvinia, Nikolay Biryukov, the 
president of North Ossetia, Anarbek Galazov, and 
others--requires a separate publication. And this is 
characteristic not only of Russia, incidentally. It is 
sufficient to recall, for example, Nikolay Bagrov, chairman of 
the Crimean Parliament, or Aslan Abashidze, chairman of the 
parliament of Ajaria, and the role performed in the life of 
Azerbaijan by its present president Geydar Aliyev in the office 
of chairman of the parliament of Nakhichevan in order to see how 
multidimensional is the process of disintegration of the Soviet 
Union and to see for oneself the incompleteness of this process. 
But we will meanwhile plot the present situation recorded 
recently by the 12 portraits hung outside the residence of the 
president of Turkmenistan.

<F P=106> [Interview with Abduzhalil Samadov, chairman of the Council </F>
of Ministers of Tajikistan, by Vladimir Chernyshev in Moscow; 
date not given: "In Tajikistan the Ruble Is Not Foreign 
Currency"] 
  [Text] Our conversation with A. Samadov, chairman of 
the Council of Ministers of Tajikistan, took place in Moscow. As 
the head of a government delegation, he had many meetings, 
consultations, and negotiations here. Nevertheless, this busy 
working visit remained outside the attention of the 
press--probably undeservedly. Major policies are not made in 
front of television cameras or receptions filled with pomp. 
  [Chernyshev] Abduzhalil Akhadovich, what was the main thrust 
of the meetings and negotiations you had in Russia? 
  [Samadov] It is not, of course, meetings per se that are 
important for the fate of the people. What follows is important. 
To summarize the results briefly, they reinforced the feeling in 
me that Russia not only shares the pain and hopes of Tajik 
people. Just like us, Russia is sincerely ready for mutually 
beneficial cooperation at the new level of our relations. The 
totalitarian past is behind us, and what is ahead is an era of 
the civilized market and respect for human rights and dignity. 
So we came with the intention of working in this era. In Moscow 
we made an important comparison of viewpoints--they are similar 
across the entire spectrum of Russian-Tajik relations. 
  Russia, Uzbekistan, and other CIS countries have been and 
will remain our main partners in the foreseeable future. Up to 
80 percent of the Tajik economy is contingent upon CIS 
countries. And it hardly makes sense for the Commonwealth, with 
Russia as its centripetal center, to reject the economic 
opportunities of the Tajik market. In terms of not only raw 
materials but also finished products. 
  [Chernyshev] The opinions has been voiced in the Russian 
press that bringing a number of CIS states back into the ruble 
zone will cause a new round of inflation in the economy. What 
can you say on this subject? 
  [Samadov] Such a viewpoint has a right to exist. But let us 
look at this phenomenon from another angle as well. Expansion of 
the ruble zone will boost, launch, develop, and strengthen 
production, economic, and many other ties. Tajikistan, for 
instance, is ready to supply cotton, fruit, vegetables, and 
other products. But we need metal, equipment, petroleum 
products, and many other things. In the situation of separate 
"zones," that is, disrupted ties, Russian textile enterprises 
began to experience a dearth of cotton; the trade sector needs 
cheap fruit, vegetables, canned products; other consumers need 
the variety of products previously supplied by Tajikistan. In 
the Russian market all this was being made up for by shipments 
of goods mainly from West Europe. For hard currency, of course. 
Because the West does not want to buy those Russian products 
that in the past went to Tajikistan. Which means that having 
broken the ties with the CIS countries, the Russian economy and 
society were subjected to a great cataclysm, a shock. But this 
did not translate into therapy; in a number of places production 
declined sharply. Has the ruble become stronger for this? Has 
the people's situation improved? Has domestic production gone up? 
  We heard these kinds of biting questions and opinions from 
competent Russian specialists in finance, economics, and 
production. This means that we need different mechanisms to 
carry out the tasks we have set for ourselves. Therefore we 
noted with great satisfaction the position of a number of deputy 
groups and factions in the State Duma and the Federation 
Council, the leadership of the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Finance and Central Bank of Russia, and ministries and 
agencies--a position that is close to the way we see things: The 
way to strengthen the ruble should be sought not in narrowing 
down its sphere of circulation but, on the contrary, in 
expanding it. We cannot look at this problem from the position 
of a small merchant. Which is: obtain ruble credit in one place, 
turn it over in another, then pocket the profit and pay off 
debts. The state economy works according to a different scheme. 
We have to look at this process more broadly. For instance, if 
Russian rubles begin to flow into the Tajik zone, a certain 
shortage of rubles will emerge in Russia itself, as you might 
easily guess. The rising demand for the ruble will in turn 
affect the exchange rate--it will go up. Of course, not 
everything is this simple in real life. This aspect and many 
others related to Tajikistan's entry into the ruble zone will be 
considered soon by a group of authoritative Russian experts, 
whose arrival we are expecting in Dushanbe. 
  We, in turn, also intend to establish appropriate control to 
keep our economy from living on cheap rubles. The point is to 
make financial resources reflect adequately in the movement of 
many other resources, assist in their forward movement. It is 
clear that we do not intend to play the role of spongers in the 
ruble zone. 
  I will ask you a teaser. What do you think: Will the 
position 
of the American dollar become stronger or weaker if the zone of 
its circulation becomes limited only to the territory of the 
United States? I doubt that even one American economist will 
answer this question in the affirmative. So I also believe that 
the ruble zone can and should expand, and the ruble should 
become a full-fledged international means of payment. 
  [Chernyshev] This means that to the relief of business 
circles of two countries we may say that after Tajikistan joins 
the ruble zone the problem of nonpayments will also become a 
thing of the past? 
  [Samadov] Undoubtedly. Mostly we have inherited nonpayments 
as a legacy from the Soviet past. But there is a time for 
everything. You do not start building a house with the roof. The 
same goes for us: We have to create the proper conditions for 
normal economic relations, their legislative foundation. Be our 
guests--trade, work, build. Our government will be only too glad 
to help. But any particular deals and operations are a 
prerogative of the parties to the agreement. Since as a result 
of the crisis Tajik society has experienced a textbook case of 
force majeure across the entire complex of production, trade, 
financial, and other ties with CIS countries, we see it as one 
of our vital tasks to prevent this sort of event happening in 
the future. When the economy begins to grow, there will be no 
reason for people to gather at rallies. They will be busy with 
the business at hand. It is like a system of communicating 
vessels. 
  We are very grateful to all those partners in Russia and CIS 
countries who, at a difficult time for our motherland, supplied 
us with food, clothes, petroleum products, raw materials, and 
parts... Behind this stream of rather costly resources was and 
is the labor of tens of thousands people. Although we are living 
through a very difficult period, I dare say that the time will 
come when not a single person will regret helping Tajikistan in 
its hour of hardship. This is not in our national character. 
  [Chernyshev] In your opinion, which directions of 
Russian-Tajik cooperation are most promising today? 
  [Samadov] Practically any sphere. Our traditional export 
products. The development of mineral deposits, in which we have 
nearly all the elements in the Mendeleyev table. The extensive 
potential of agricultural production. But we have to start 
small. Areas that can bring tangible returns in the near future, 
establish solid ties. Tajikistan has, for instance, great places 
for health spas and recreation. We have many resort zones, 
including those with curative hot springs. This is a launching 
pad for the development of prestigious 7,000-meter-high mountain 
resorts. I could spend hours telling you about our land of 
plenty, blessed by sun and nature. Spring will come soon to the 
southern parts. Valleys will be covered with emerald greenery 
and a sea of flowers. Better come and see for yourself. But it 
is better still to come to work rather than vacation. We will do 
everything to bring people's living standards up to commonly 
recognized norms, to establish their direct economic interests. 
This applies to a full extent to Russians as well. Especially 
those who were literally forced to leave Tajikistan. 
  As to certain concerns regarding political instability, I 
can 
tell you unequivocally: Life is getting back to normal. Today 
there are no more dangers facing you in our land than in any 
other country. "Isolated incidents" can happen anywhere, and 
they do not happen by the will of governments or peoples. 
  [Chernyshev] How will the economic reform that is underway 
in 
your country affect Tajikistan's export potential in the near 
future? 
  [Samadov] The economic reform is a component of our merging 
with the Russian economy. We have laws on property, enterprise, 
and investment that are similar in many respects... Moreover, we 
envisage additional steps that will create a most favorable 
status for Russian entrepreneurs. We do not envisage any 
obstacles or barriers to the movement of capital. 
  The formula of our reform is to put in motion productive 
forces in Tajik society, to put into action most effectively its 
rich economic, scientific, and spiritual potential. To ensure 
the formation of a dynamic market economy and the priority of 
human rights and dignity, which are deeply consonant with 
fundamental values and views in the East and the 
sociopsychological traits of our peoples. We are striving to 
manage without a ponderous administrative apparatus and red tape 
in dealing with various matters. And most importantly, to create 
conditions for the forward development of society while not 
permitting the state to interfere in the life of its citizens 
and entrepreneurs. Our economy must have a "Tajik face." We do 
not have any other path to revival.

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Grudinina: "`Free' Estonia and `Partially </F>
Free' Russia Continue To Clarify Their Relations: Russian 
Federation Minister of Foreign Affairs Accused of Slander"] 
  [Text] As reported by the press service of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs of Estonia, on 9 February Estonia's ambassador 
to Moscow received instructions to protest a series of 
"slanderous and inaccurate" statements by the minister of 
foreign affairs and other officials of Russia. Insofar as a 
number of delegations of the United Nations, Council on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, Council of Europe, and other 
international organizations have confirmed that the situation in 
Estonia is entirely in conformance with international human 
rights standards, the press release states, the question arises: 
Who is concealing the truth--international organizations or the 
political figure who has repeatedly proclaimed Estonia to be 
part of the Russian sphere of interest, the so-called near 
abroad? The laws of the Estonian Republic allow everyone to 
obtain Estonian citizenship, regardless of ethnicity. But the 
minister's statements, as noted by the Estonian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, contain a positive aspect (concerning a 
reference to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact). This instills the 
hope that the Russian minister of foreign affairs will be able 
to take the next step and admit that the Baltic countries were 
occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940. 
  Estonia's Minister of Foreign Affairs Juri Luik, in turn, 
did 
not ignore the interview given by Andrey Kozyrev to the American 
weekly NEWSWEEK and published in the 14 February issue. In 
response to the NEWSWEEK correspondent's question as to whether 
the minister truly meant in an address to Russian diplomats that 
troops should not be withdrawn from the Baltic countries, Luik 
believes that Kozyrev did not provide a clear answer. I would be 
quite happy to see Mr. Kozyrev find the opportunity to answer 
this question once again, this time more precisely, the Estonian 
minister stated. 
  With regard to the Estonian demarche, it is useful to 
publish 
Andrey Kozyrev's utterances verbatim. In conversation with 
journalists on 8 February, the minister stated the following: 
"Approximately a third of the populace is set apart by virtue of 
ethnicity. We are talking about Russian-speaking 
people--Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Jews, and even 
Finns--who are denied the right of citizenship. They want to 
acquire such citizenship but are denied it for one reason 
only--ethnicity. If this is not `ethnic cleansing,' then what 
is?" (Here and henceforth we quote INTERFAX). In Kozyrev's 
opinion, in certain instances, in Bosnia and Herzegovina for 
example, "ethnic cleansing" is manifest in the form of criminal 
violence, in other instances--in the form of denial of civil 
rights, the right of citizenship in particular, for large 
population groups. "If anywhere people are called `occupiers' 
and `noncitizens,' they begin to conduct themselves accordingly. 
The result is instability," the minister stated. He then cited 
another example of encroachment on the rights of 
Russian-speaking people: "In the former USSR, everyone had a 
military obligation. There was no exception for Estonians or 
Latvians--they too served in the Soviet Army. But now they want 
to remove from Estonia and Latvia not all former servicemen in 
the Soviet Army, only the Russian-speaking ones. It is evident 
that the basis of the demand to remove servicemen comprises not 
a political, but rather an ethnic principle." In the minister's 
words, attempts to take out crimes of the Stalinist regime on 
simple people constitute political stupidity." "I admit the 
crimes of the Stalinist regime, but one must not forget that 
these were committed by political authorities--Stalin on the one 
hand, and Hitler on the other--that concluded the 
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Attempts 45 years later to take it out 
on thousands of simple people for the commission of these crimes 
and use the principle of ethnicity in doing so--are 
intolerable." "The world must turn its attention to this 
inhumane and potentially dangerous situation," Kozyrev concluded. 
  There can be no doubt but that the minister's words are 
harsh 
to say the least, and possibly "inaccurate," but to categorize 
them as slander means closing one's eyes to the true state of 
affairs. Which is in fact what the prestigious Western 
structures and organizations whose views are being cited by the 
Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs are doing. These groups 
include, for example, the American human rights organization 
Freedom House, which published its regular report for 1993 
encompassing 190 countries and 63 territories. The section 
pertaining to "countries that are not free" lists Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Azerbaijan, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The author of the 
report categorizes the following countries as "partially free": 
Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Georgia, 
Belarus, Armenia, Romania, Macedonia, Slovakia, and Latvia. The 
experts proclaimed Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Poland, Slovenia, Lithuania, and Estonia to be "free." When 
compared with last year's report with respect to the Baltic 
countries, it is Estonia that received an "upgrade," moving out 
of the category "partially free" to "free." We must point out 
that the situation of the Russian-speaking population was 
precisely the key criterion in last year's report, in 
particular, "the measures to restrict citizenship and the denial 
of citizenship to Russian-speaking inhabitants." We must presume 
that the Russians in Estonia will be happy to hear that they are 
living today in a country that is completely free. 
  P.S. INTERFAX reported yesterday that Estonian President 
Lennart Meri demanded an explanation from Aleksandr Trofimov, 
Russian Federation ambassador to Tallinn, in connection with the 
statements of Russian officials. A report distributed to the 
press Wednesday evening by the Chancellery of the Estonian head 
of state cites the words of Mikhail Demurin, official 
representative of the Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. According to the press release, Demurin stated that "in 
the establishment of international relations, the use of 
diplomatic means alone is insufficient." The document also 
mentions that in his recent interview with NEWSWEEK, Russian 
Federation Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev accused 
Latvia of intent to deport Russians, and he "threatened conflict 
with the Latvian Republic." The document emphasizes that "the 
actual situation in Estonia has nothing in common with the 
picture certain extremist-chauvinist politicians in Moscow are 
attempting to draw, and this fact is without a doubt well known 
to the officials who are formulating Russia's foreign policy."

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Igrunov, deputy of the State Duma: </F>
"Crimea Has Decided--Not That Meshkov Is Better, But Simply That 
There Has Been Enough of Bagrov"] 
  [Text] When, during the first round of presidential 
elections in Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, unexpectedly for most 
politicians, took 37 percent of the vote, a commotion was raised 
in Kiev. From the outside one got the impression that Ukraine 
was ready to intervene in order to prevent a second round. L. 
Kravchuk received special authorization, and Ukrainian 
nationalists urged him on to use force. If he had given in and 
had not allowed for the resolution of the Crimean question "from 
the inside," an outpouring of political emotions and 
confrontations with the participation of the Black Sea fleet 
would have become inevitable. 
  As a member of the Duma committee on matters pertaining to 
the CIS, I decided to travel to Kiev and Crimea, and to look at 
the whole situation on the spot. The trip was a private one, 
since our committee at that point had not been able to work out 
a common position. 
  Indecisiveness reigned in Kiev--that very condition in which 
the most serious mistakes are allowed to occur. Sensible 
Ukrainian politicians understood that the unwillingness of 
Crimeans to live as before was so strong that changing the 
situation would be possible only by force--force that was not 
there, since Ukraine as a state found itself on the verge of 
catastrophe, on the threshold of a possible explosion of social 
discontent. On the eve of the new elections, when the Ukrainian 
state would inevitably have to change its orientation, the 
politicians in Kiev found themselves unwilling to take upon 
themselves the responsibility for forcible pressure on Crimea 
and a possible armed conflict. 
  Bagrov, who had been Kiev's favorite going into the past 
elections, had in the past been a pro-Russian pioneer and, 
essentially, of Crimea's anti-Ukrainian orientation. But having 
worked for a bit under the new conditions, he grasped the 
realities and thought it advisable to stand up for the unity of 
Ukraine--with Crimea as a component part of it. With this 
pragmatic position of his, he identified himself with Ukraine, 
and lost the support of the population in almost total measure. 
  In Kiev, Meshkov was viewed as a protege of imperial forces, 
a separatist, ready to violate the integrity of the Ukrainian 
state. In actual fact, the situation was much more complicated. 
Meshkov found himself a hostage to an idea: He demanded decisive 
actions for the obtaining of independence, and he agitated for a 
referendum on the restoration of the Crimean Constitution, which 
was adopted in May 1992. But already as he was taking part in 
the elections, he realized that immediately incorporating Crimea 
into Russia was impossible. Meshkov understood that Crimea's 
rapprochement with Russia would not happen all at once, but in 
stages, and would most likely take place not at all in the form 
of a separation from Ukraine and entry into Russia. Crimea could 
become that locomotive that pulls Ukraine toward Russia, aiding 
in their rapprochement. And that was why, directly after the 
first round of voting, Meshkov made the appropriate 
announcement. Bagrov played on this, saying: "See--there is no 
alternative to my way!", which compelled Meshkov again to 
emphasize his radicalism. As a result, from the outside one got 
the impression that this was an irresponsible person who was 
grasping for power, a person who would quickly proclaim Crimea's 
independence. And further on, Ukraine would answer with forcible 
methods, and a war would start. 
  In fact, Meshkov has no program that differs from Bagrov's. 
He proposes different methods. Bagrov trod only those paths that 
had been trampled smooth by the party nomenklatura: He traveled 
to Kiev, reported on everything, and supposed that the matter 
was in the bag. And when parliament did not approve or did not 
carry out the arrangement, it came as a surprise to him. But 
Meshkov and other opponents believe that it is necessary to seek 
to achieve not arrangements, but the adoption of corresponding 
laws; it is necessary to make a break and to forge ahead. This 
is an objective contradiction, which cannot be avoided in this 
changing world. 
  Of course, a changing of the guard must take place from time 
to time. I met with many very highly placed bureaucrats of 
Bagrov's team. And they gave me to understand that they were 
tired of Bagrov: That was it; they could do no more. It was not 
that Meshkov was better, but simply that they had had enough of 
Bagrov. Another segment felt that Bagrov was losing the reins, 
that power was slipping away and was already switching over to 
other banners. As a result, even before Meshkov's victory, the 
level of control in Bagrov's team approached zero. 
  Meshkov gave me the impression of being a rather well-bred 
person. He tries to act like, and copies the behavior of, 
"decisive" people, who can bang their fists on the table. But he 
is a mild person, and one feels a pose, an artificiality, in his 
decisiveness. Some seek to alarm us, saying: "He is a Crimean 
Zhirinovskiy!" Nothing of the kind. It is another matter that 
the motives for voting for Meshkov are the same as those of the 
Russian population for voting for Zhirinovskiy. If one gets rid 
of Meshkov, a Zhirinovskiy will be there next, because that is 
precisely the mood in Crimea. 
  Bagrov sits in the luxurious building of the Supreme 
Council; 
I met with Meshkov in a not overly clean, unfurnished room in 
the Veterans Union. He was guarded by Afghan veterans with 
submachine guns; these guys sat around in everyday sweaters. 
None of them wore jackets or ties. A completely different 
atmosphere. There is some kind of political fanatic on his team, 
but there are also former political prisoners, members of the 
local intelligentsia, and so on. It would be a mistake to expect 
of him the same as from Zhirinovskiy. The people surrounding 
Meshkov understand the complexity of the problems and are 
willing not to be in a hurry, to act together with Ukraine and 
Russia without any extravagant steps. They understand the needs 
of the population and are ready to move in that 
direction--understanding the difficulties, they are prepared to 
act with moderation. But it is immediately apparent that they 
cannot deal with the situation. They will not know how to work 
with the apparat. 
  Bagrov is surrounded by a very bad circle: It includes many 
corrupted bureaucrats and mafiosi. And here come young people, 
who want to realize their program by honest means, not behind 
the scenes, not over the telephone, but in a normal way, through 
the legislature. They are planning to struggle with corruption, 
but economic monsters have already sucked onto power there. 
  What are the new politicians to do? Needless to say, a panic 
begins. I can understand Meshkov, hiding behind submachine guns. 
After all, how many political figures and entrepreneurs have 
been killed! I do not rule out the possibility that a disruption 
of production and an outflow of capital will begin in Crimea. 
  Now let us imagine that Meshkov really does conduct a 
referendum with strict formulations on the status of Crimea. I 
do not think that the Ukrainian Government will embark on any 
kind of resolute actions. One scenario, however, is possible, 
where the Ukrainian National Self-Defense Organization would 
send its detachments there. Then a catastrophe would be 
inevitable. There is enough militia presence summoned from 
Galician parts, and there are extreme nationalists there--both 
Ukrainian and Russian. Clashes take place with Crimean Tatars, 
who are prepared to act in the most resolute manner. In such a 
situation there are enough sparks to start a Dniester region. 
And a Dniester region in Crimea would be horrifying, if only 
because the Black Sea fleet is no 14th Army. A catastrophe could 
happen here. Neither Ukraine nor Russia could remain uninvolved, 
even if they very much wanted to. The Cossacks would come in 
from Russia, and the Zaporozhtsy would come in from Ukraine. And 
after them, like it or not, our tanks and Ukrainian tanks.... 
  Just one gaffe in Meshkov's behavior, or Bagrov's refusal to 
participate in the power structures, could provoke a serious 
conflict in Crimea. Russia would do well to act as an active 
mediator and avert hasty actions. It would be possible to make 
an announcement that would restrain the population from making 
extreme demands, and this would allow Meshkov to save face. It 
would be possible to try, on the one hand, to convince the 
former executive power to deal with the new president and the 
new realities. To propose some kind of paths that would inspire 
the confidence of Ukraine, to prepare Ukrainian dialogue with 
Moscow. Moscow's moderation in its demands of Crimea, and a 
refusal to carry out the decisions of the former Supreme 
Soviet--even without their formal repeal--would create the 
prerequisites for the rapprochement of Ukraine and Russia. That 
would help support stability in Crimea.

<F P=106> [Article by NEZAVISIMOST special correspondent Yanina </F>
Sokolovskaya: "Crimea Dreams of Living on Moscow Time"] 
  [Text] It is easy to entice a crowd, especially an underfed 
one, by promises--even unrealizable and dangerous promises, if 
they chart golden horizons. The crowd is responsive to the 
simplest of slogans and ready to support leaders who zealously 
demonstrate their closeness to the people. Such was the crowd 
that voted for Zhirinovskiy. And such was the election of the 
leader of the Russia bloc to the post of president of Crimea. 
  Supporters of N. Bagrov were not justified in their reliance 
on residents of the rural localities. Nor were there grounds, 
incidentally, for the flimsy hope that not enough people would 
turn out for the election in the event of good weather, when 
citizens would show preference to their farmstead plots over the 
polling stations. Journalists sensationalized the matter: "More 
than a million Crimeans have lost their minds." "People did not 
vote for the election program of the current president, or even 
for Yuriy Meshkov, but against the present difficult 
situation"--explained Nikolay Bagrov, former candidate for 
president of Crimea, who in all likelihood will also soon become 
ex-chairman of the Supreme Council. During the final minutes of 
the session of the Presidium of the Supreme Council he 
proclaimed: "I consider it impossible to remain in the post of 
chairman of the Supreme Council following the results of the 
second round of voting." And then he took leave. 
  "I understand that a difficult life lies ahead of me, but I 
am staying in the Crimea. I will leave politics for at least two 
to four years. I will not run for election to any parliament. 
And I will not head the opposition of the new Crimean 
authority"--Nikolay Vasilyevich stated in his farewell. He 
promised to dedicate the time he would now have free to working 
on an encyclopedia of the Crimea. 
  On 4 February the session will take up discussion of his 
resignation. That same day the Crimean parliament will 
administer the oath of the new president of Crimea. It cannot be 
ruled out that he will swear the oath on the Bible--"my 
handbook." Preparation is already underway for the inauguration 
(expected to be rather flamboyant) under the direction of 
Meshkov's "right hand"--Viktor Mezhak, leader of the People's 
Party of Crimea, belonging to the Russia bloc. 
  As Yu. Meshkov recently related, incidentally, he conducted 
his election campaign based on "funds received from commercial 
structures." And the debt will likely be a pretty sum. But the 
lives of pensioners and other citizens who fought for Meshkov in 
the expectation of ruble payments can hardly be expected to 
change by virtue of Yuriy Aleksandrovich's election. However, as 
Viktor Bobylev, member of the Presidium of the Crimean 
parliament, noted, "As early as Monday they have begun demanding 
pensions and wages in rubles" while dancing victory dances 
outside the walls of the parliament. 
  If we are to believe the promises of their elected official, 
ruble payments will only begin being made in the summer. But 
even this seems hardly likely. Russian specialists attest that 
there are not enough rubles for everyone. The entry of Belarus 
alone into the ruble zone is already causing 15-30 percent 
inflation. Anti-Belarus sentiment is presently building in 
Moscow. In all likelihood we do not have long to wait for 
anti-Crimean feelings--"No matter how tempting Crimea may be, we 
have no need for indigent people." Especially since the 
"indigent" will ask for 40 billion in pensions and 130 billion 
in wages. Another reason Russia will not decide to annex Crimea, 
according to Crimea observers, is the fact that Mr. Clinton 
would get the opportunity to review the recent trilateral 
agreement, whose basis comprises guarantees of the inviolability 
of borders. Therefore, plans of the RDK [Crimea Republican 
Movement] to lower taxes, create the Central Bank of 
Crimea--"savior of the Crimean economy," open up Crimea's own 
currency exchange and branches of Russian banks while shutting 
down Ukrainian ones, and place purely Russian state requisitions 
at plants--all this reverberates as harebrained scheming. 
  "The emergence of a republic bank will not rescue Crimea and 
will not give it increased independence. Such an institution 
will turn into an ordinary commercial bank"--is the belief of 
well-known Crimean financial expert Sh. Tsivadze. 
  With the planned Crimean budget deficit (9.9 trillion 
karbovantsy for 1994), the fist method can hardly be expected to 
help the situation. Though Yuriy Aleksandrovich will not skip 
any opportunity to bang his on the table. It is precisely with 
this gesture that he began his first presidential press 
conference, proclaiming: "Unification of Crimea is possible only 
with the emergence of a certain personage. I am that 
personage..." 
  However, the newly fledged president will not only have to 
deliver oratory at demonstrations. He will be faced with quite 
real problems as well: It was reported just days ago that due to 
the shortage of electric power, Crimea will stop receiving water 
from the Dnieper. Fuel supplies for just a few weeks remain... 
  But Meshkov assured his countrymen that his bloc has an 
understanding with the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy, in 
accordance with which Crimean electric power plants will be 
converted to gas and it is planned to lay a line across the 
Kerch Strait which will boost Crimea's energy capacities. This 
is all well and good, but construction of the line will take 
about three years. While in the opinion of specialists, Ukraine 
may cut off energy deliveries to the peninsula of the 10 billion 
kilowatt-hours presently being consumed. 
  It cannot be ruled out that the question "Who will have a 
good life in Crimea?" will become a rhetorical one. Perhaps only 
the sailors of the Black Sea Fleet, to whom Meshkov promised: 
"The Black Sea Fleet must be a solely Russian fleet. This will 
constitute one more factor of stability in Crimea." Their share 
of votes in the victory of the president was fairly significant. 
  Also sounding victory is the Communist Party of Crimea. 
Although its candidate L. Grach was unsuccessful, an opportunity 
emerged on the other hand to once again unite in a great and 
powerful USSR. Incidentally, political experts predict that 
Communist Grach will not be the lowest ranking figure on 
Meshkov's team. And it is possible that in time he will come to 
replace him. 
  With such an array, the next step of the new Crimean 
authority seems logical--in the spirit of bygone traditions, it 
has drawn up fairly clearly the outlines of its enemies. Named 
the first of these is Stepan Khmara, who "came in and riled up 
the entire Crimean populace." Second in line are the 
"West-Ukrainian nationalists who are hampering the building of 
relations with Russia, explaining that 'the Russkies have eaten 
up all our lard,' 'although Russia feeds many.'" Entered third 
on the black list, it seems, is the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar 
people. As Yuriy Meshkov clearly explained, "there will not be 
two organs of representational authority in Crimea." 
  But Majlis leader Mustafa Jemilev stated: "No people can be 
denied the right to protect themselves." And the Tatars, 
organized into a fairly significant force, "will resort to acts 
of civil disobedience--in the event Meshkov continues his 
separatism. This will be the beginning of the end of his 
presidency." At that time a declaration will be made of the 
illegality of the election. For Tatars, the president will be 
simply a private individual. But for the time being, in its 
search for support the Majlis is specifying points of contact 
with all-Ukrainian democratic organizations. 
  A conflict is looming, no matter how hard the new authority 
tries to hide this with its American-style smiles. In the 
meantime, the authority's leading figures sometimes blurt things 
out. In answering a question concerning the Dniester-like 
prospects of the Crimea, Viktor Mezhak noted: "It depends on 
what kind of wave [as published] you have in mind--world, civil, 
or local." Ivan Yermakov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Council 
of Crimea, believes: "If Meshkov takes sudden steps, the 
situation may become exacerbated." A revision of borders means 
war--the Majlis and Nikolay Bagrov have stated. While Western 
observers add that half a year from now they will not risk 
travelling to the Crimea. They observe that it will be difficult 
now for Crimeans to escape the syndrome of civil war. 
  One would like to believe that alternatives are possible. 
Listening to the points made by Yu. Meshkov, which change daily, 
political experts are beginning to say that the president of 
Crimea is attempting to refrain from radical measures so that 
Kiev will not annul the election. He will most likely limit 
himself to introducing Moscow time and fiscal economic measures. 
In order to somehow prove himself in the role of reformer. 
Isolation of the branches of power is expected with time. When 
each ministry begins to chart its own policy course, ignoring 
the president, the parliament will be unable to act as an 
opponent to the government's decisions. 
  Meanwhile, pro-Ukraine oriented Crimeans are relying on the 
prospect that in the event Meshkov takes sudden actions, L. 
Kravchuk will just declare these to be unlawful. More than 
sufficient pretext will be available for this. Some provisions 
of the Crimean law on the presidency contradict articles of the 
Constitution. The Majlis attests: "Manipulative irregularities 
were noted during the first round of the voting. Heads of 
electoral commissions stuffed ballots into the ballot boxes with 
the name of the undesirable Bagrov crossed out." The Majlis also 
warns: Unless L. Kravchuk changes his wait-and-see position, 
sufficient forces will be found in Ukraine capable of properly 
sorting things out. 
  In the meantime, an interesting thought is spreading around 
Simferopol, to the effect of--why drift in the direction of an 
insecure Russia when a rich historical relative--Turkey--is 
much, much closer? Would it not be better to set up family ties 
here? 
  At the same time, Yu. Meshkov, who still has not assumed his 
presidential duties because of lack of a residence, awaits the 
pleasant moment when he will be awarded a black Lincoln by 
Sevastopol billionaire Sergey Shurygoy, who promised to present 
this to the first president of Crimea.

<F P=106> [Article by Olga Pronina: "Why Are Crimean Tatars Alarmed?"] </F>
  [Text] We are aware of how complicated relations have 
become between the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people and the 
present Supreme Council of Crimea. All the same, reasonable 
forces on both sides have come to prevail. Sharp confrontation 
has been replaced by a mutual striving to reach compromise. 
Already this approach has succeeded in achieving the first 
positive results. Therefore, the statement of Yu. Meshkov made 
before numerous journalists, foreign journalists among them, to 
the effect that he will do business with the Majlis only in the 
event of "its legalization and registration as a sociopolitical 
organization" has evoked entirely understandable alarm, and not 
only among the Crimean Tatars. 
  Here is how Majlis leaders Mustafa Jemilev and Refat 
Chubarov 
have responded to these statements. 
  Mustafa Jemilev--We have already declared in an 
adopted resolution that the Majlis does not recognize the 
presidential authority of a person whose policies are directed 
towards denial of the fundamental rights of the Crimean Tatar 
people with respect to self-determination. Judging from his 
program declarations and statements before journalists, Yu. 
Meshkov, just now elected president, does not intend to observe 
our sovereign rights. Crimean Tatars therefore do not 
acknowledge him as the president. 
  This in no way means, however, that we will oppose all his 
directives and measures. On the contrary. If the actions of the 
president are directed towards restoration of the rights of a 
deported people, we will only welcome this and support it. 
  The Majlis will convene 19 February. Over this period of 
time, new events will obviously take place which will more 
precisely define Yu. Meshkov's position. We will then adopt a 
special declaration on the matter of the presidency and on the 
president personally. 
  Refat Chubarov--Yu. Meshkov knows full well that 
the Kurultay [Congress] and Majlis elected by it have never 
claimed any kind of special status in the Crimea. The Kurultay 
is the highest spokesman of the will and interests of the 
Crimean Tatar people, and the Majlis is its highest 
representational organ. We have never had, and do not now have 
any aspirations of considering ourselves a parallel structure of 
authority, as Yu. Meshkov has stated. During his tenure as 
Supreme Council deputy he had the opportunity to examine all of 
this. The fact that he is making such statements all the same is 
astonishing to us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleksandr Stoyan by Oleh Husev under the </F>
rubric "In the Parties and Movements": "O. Stoyan: "There is No 
Need to Serve an Overseas Uncle...," with subsequent commentary 
from O. Sheykin presented by commentator Volodymyr Skachko under 
the rubric "In Place of Commentary": "It is True--It is Time to 
Be Concerned About People"] 
  [Text] The editors received copies of letters the 
other day whose content evoked great astonishment and a desire 
to comment on them. Which the chairman of the Federation of 
Trade Unions of Ukraine (FPU), Oleksandr Stoyan, agreed to do. 
  It is not so much a matter of some unusual appeals of 
the "dear brother" type as it is, first and foremost, the 
content of the letters. We are talking about the letter of the 
leader of the Solidarity Trade Unions of Ukraine, O. Sheykin, to 
the president of the American trade unions, Lane Kirkland, whom 
the author asks to "organize a boycott and halt all ties of the 
United States at all levels with the reactionary leadership of 
Ukraine." The motivation for the letter is a simple one--it is 
the author's idea that there is no democracy in Ukraine, there 
are no guarantees of the rights of the workers, and the 
independent trade-union movement continues to be oppressed. 
  The floor then to O. Stoyan: 
  [O. Stoyan] As you see, the reproaches directed toward 
Ukraine and its trade unions are quite serious. 
  [O. Husev] Are concrete cases known to you of violence, 
arrests, murders or attempts at the physical annihilation of the 
leaders of trade unions? 
  [O. Stoyan] They are not. If they were to happen, then 
doubtlessly we would come to the aid of representatives of all 
union groups to fight them at the level of the FPU. 
  I recall in this connection an incident with the president 
of 
the Association of Trade Unions of Flight Personnel, V. 
Bulashov, that arose under unclear circumstances. The FPU 
allocated funds for the funeral of the trade-union leader. 
  [O. Husev] A few words, if you would, on the relations of 
the 
FPU with the newly created trade-union organizations. 
  [O. Stoyan] We are doing everything in principle so that our 
relations are of a normal, businesslike nature. We feel that the 
path of confrontation with the new trade unions is not 
promising. The federation has to reach a general rate agreement 
with the government for 1994, and draw up a declaration in 
mutual actions aimed at the building of a sovereign Ukraine, 
with their participation. 
  These new creations, however, have lately begun to act 
against us without any restraints--moral or legal. Here is the 
recent declaration of Oleksandr Mryl regarding the creation of 
the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine. The professional associations 
of engineers, aviators, and the Solidarity trade unions, among 
others, are part of it. Their size is not more than a hundred 
thousand members. The first thing that the chairman of their 
executive committee does is to draw up a letter to the FPU with 
the proposal to allocate in Kiev, at the Trade Union Hall, 
accommodations with an area of no less than 580 square meters 
for its commissions and departments. It must be said that there 
are 40 sector committees at the republic level located in that 
building, and each of them unites considerably more members than 
the new created trade unions all together. And, I emphasize, 
have more rights accordingly, especially since they paid a great 
deal of funds for the very construction of the union hall. The 
Independent Trade Union of Miners, by the way, had already been 
allotted accommodations there. But it has been leased out, which 
is improper in principle. 
  We know that a citizen of the United States is working in 
that office, who devotes a great deal of her work time--as can 
be seen from telephone bills--to conversations with North 
America and Great Britain. 
  Also surprising is the fact that O. Mryl is demanding the 
granting of accommodations for the union of miners in the center 
of Kiev and not in the Donbass, not at the place where most of 
the mines are located and, by the way, the trade union of 
workers in the coal industry of Ukraine, uniting over a million 
members, operates. I cannot fail to mention the tone of 
ultimatum in the letter of O. Mryl, where he says in particular 
that "I ask you to address very seriously the question of 
allocating to the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine the spaces 
necessary for their work in the Hall of Trade Unions, and not to 
instigate our member organizations to decisive acts in reply to 
your possibly poorly thought-out decision." 
  Tell me, is it possible to work with this author in a 
fruitful and good-hearted manner after such a letter? 
  And more. Reading the appeal of the newly created trade 
unions to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of 
Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), I cannot help but be 
surprised at the very fact of its appearance. The so-called Free 
Trade Unions of Ukraine, having absolutely no grounds to speak 
of any pressure or persecution in Ukraine, are however calling 
on the president and government of the United States for 
sanctions of a political and economic nature against Ukraine, 
whose citizens they are, not even stopping short of a boycott of 
it. I would like to ask whether our own or foreign trade unions 
permit themselves that? And is that a pluralism of ideas? Hardly. 
  I understand that there could be differing views within the 
FPU and in the newly created associations on the nature of the 
actions of the state authorities, but their aim is a common 
one--to bring benefit to Ukraine. We have something else in 
practice. While the FPU is conducting systematic negotiations 
with the government with regard to improving the life of all of 
Ukraine, the newly created trade associations often are 
concerned only for concessions for certain categories of 
workers, winning them for themselves at the expense of others. 
Recall that the FPU has in recent months proclaimed a pre-strike 
situation, and posed the question to the next session of the 
Supreme Soviet of the abrogation of the penalties for 
enterprises that are operating normally, of a rise in the level 
of minimum wages and pensions, and other questions of social 
protections for the population. The newly created trade unions, 
in their appeals across the ocean, are posing the question of 
undermining the foundations of our state--our own citizens are 
appealing to the United States to organize a boycott against 
Ukraine. That is, to wage political and economic blackmail. 
  [O. Husev] I would like to hear your thoughts regarding the 
fact, as KYEVSKYYE VEDOMOSTY has reported, that a flag was 
raised over the Capitol in the United States in honor of the 
Kiev engineer Semen Karykov, the chairman of the Free Trade 
Union of Railroad Engineers of Ukraine. 
  [O. Stoyan] I know and will answer thus: what would you 
journalists have written if a flag was raised over the building 
where the President of Ukraine works, say, in honor of the 
chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine? Take your 
time to answer--I can envisage such reporting to the last 
detail, and even its key words: "The FPU are trade unions that 
serve the president!" 
  The question arises, "So just what merits the raising of the 
national flag of the United States over the Capitol in 
Washington in honor of Karykov?" I will cite the reasons, for 
they really do exist; in the summer of 1992, an engineers' 
strike paralyzed the harvest in southern Ukraine, posing demands 
of essentially their own--on the whole, small--group of people. 
The miners were leaving the face with the same demands--raise 
wages only for them; at the beginning of the summer of 1993, the 
Independent Trade Union of Miners once again organized a strike. 
Ukraine once again loses billions of karbovantsi in it. The 
engineers stop transport once again... Can we really act only in 
the interests of a comparatively small group of people in the 
future as well? I am sure that we cannot, since that would be 
both unfair and costly for the economy of the whole country. 
  Perhaps it is for these services that they raise the 
American 
flag in honor of a citizen of Ukraine? Not such a high honor, 
really. 
  There is another aspect of the problem--I have in my hand 
material from the new trade union associations, in which it is 
indicated without the slightest shame that they were printed on 
equipment that was given to them by the Americans--the AFL-CIO. 
Is that not real interference by one country in the affairs of 
another? And can we even talk about any real independence of 
these "independent trade unions of Ukraine" in that case? The 
AFL-CIO is the same group of trade unions that has been bought 
by the American government. They are naturally trying to pursue 
this policy with us among those who call themselves 
representatives of the independent trade unions of Ukraine; 
making use of the latter, the government across the ocean is 
causing harm to Ukraine, the consequences of which are difficult 
to overestimate. 
  [O. Husev] It would be interesting, Oleksandr Mykolayovych, 
to know your thoughts about the copy of another letter by the 
same author addressed to U.S. President B. Clinton, in which he 
asks the addressee to stop giving Ukraine assistance until its 
leaders take "concrete steps in the direction of developing 
democracy..." 
  [O. Stoyan] I will not elucidate once again the level of 
veracity, but I will gladly talk about the last paragraph. Does 
it really become patriots--among which O. Sheykin, I think, 
counts himself--to appeal to the leader of another country to 
exert influence "on the government and President of Ukraine," 
demanding a halt to assistance that is being allotted to Ukraine 
today? That is the same as trying to throw the noose around the 
neck of one's own mother. 
<H6>  It is True--It is Time to Be Concerned About People </H6>
  Insofar as the interview with O. Stoyan is very similar 
to a "critique" within the trade unions, with accusations that 
opponents are trying to "throw the noose around the neck of 
one's own mother," I asked for comments from the chairman of the 
Solidarity Trade Unions of Ukraine, O. Sheykin. And here is what 
I heard from him. 
  "Yes, we wrote the letters cited, but I have to say that we 
were forced to do so by the overall situation in Ukraine, cases 
of repressions against the free trade unions, against other 
democratic movements and the mass media. The convicted Kharkiv 
journalist and member of the Solidarity Trade Unions Oleksandr 
Volosov, who has been stripped of the right to engage in 
journalism for a certain time, in particular. Vasyl Fedorenko, 
the chairman of the Kiev organization of the Solidarity Trade 
Unions, and Serhiy Klymenko, the chairman of the trade union of 
taxi fleet workers, were arrested. Klymenko has been subjected 
to reprisals in general for his attempt to post a trade-union 
announcement. There are also other instances, more than 20, 
while the employees of the law-enforcement bodies have been 
displaying passivity. 
  "I can say with regard to the letters that the comments by 
O. 
Stoyan have shifted their focus somewhat. I did not demand that 
assistance be halted overall, but asked only that assistance not 
be given to a non-democratic Ukraine. I wrote in the letter to 
President Clinton, "I earnestly request that you exert influence 
on the government of Ukraine and the President of Ukraine so 
that only the democratic development of Ukraine, guarantees of 
the rights and freedoms of citizens, and economic reforms can 
become the foundation for the development of ties between the 
United States and Ukraine, and that the assistance that the 
United States is giving to Ukraine today not go to strengthen a 
totalitarian regime, but is rather temporarily halted until 
concrete steps by Ukraine in the direction of the development of 
democracy." The shift in focus seems to me somewhat reminiscent 
of the dishonorable practices of 1937--they were looking for 
"enemies of the people" then, too. 
  "I would also like to add that the Solidarity Trade Unions 
are in favor of seeing that no political or public organization 
makes use of the law-enforcement or state bodies to settle 
accounts with political rivals." 
  So we have letters to America and comments on them. There is 
something else that has escaped the attention of both 
trade-union leaders, namely that there is no unity in the 
trade-union movement in Ukraine today. And this is important for 
our country--not only because the trade unions, protecting the 
economic interests of the workers, are each doing this at their 
own discretion, are pulling the blankets on themselves at the 
expense of others, but also because the trade unions in Ukraine 
today are a real political force, and not an instrument for the 
protection of the socio-economic interests of people. This is a 
continuation of Soviet times, when the trade unions were the 
"school of communism" and had to serve as the instrument of a 
certain ideological blunting of the workers, a political means 
of turning them away from an organized workers' movement. This 
feature of the Soviet trade unions was also manifested because 
in Ukraine they were decisively in favor of the parliament 
granting them the right of legislative initiative and were part 
of various political acts. 
  The situation in Ukraine, to put it mildly, is of course 
uncertain with respect to the productivity of the economic 
changes and the effectiveness of democracy. Whatever the 
politicians may say, the people are slipping into poverty, and 
this is not the best background for democratic reformation and 
for spiritual and cultural resurrection. 
  And yet in O. Sheykin's place I would not have appealed to 
those "high" Americans not to assist today's Ukraine, and in O. 
Stoyan's place I would have said as little as possible about 
nooses. And not because I am some kind of Ukrainian 
jingoist-patriot who wants to get fat off American assistance. 
It will not help us, neither large nor small. First of all, 
there are very many of us, and second, we, not pursuing economic 
reforms owing to a lack of political will for it on the part of 
our leadership, will devour it in short order. 
  But the trade unions still have a way out of this situation. 
It seems to me that it consists of the fact that since our trade 
unions already frequently come forward as a kind of political 
parties formed along professional lines, since they are able to 
organize the people, they have to unite and, relying on the 
support of the people, jointly demand of the authorities that 
they display political will and finally begin reforms. This 
pertains to the President, who is obligated to propose to 
parliament a government of reformers, and to parliament, which 
should confirm that government, and to the government, which not 
only has to propose a program of reforms, but also be able to 
fulfill it. If everyone gets to work himself, if the economy is 
revived, then the trade unions can fight not for a place in 
parliament, but rather fulfill their traditional function of 
protecting the people. As much as they write to Clinton, as much 
as they talk about social protections, a barefoot person will 
not rescue a naked person from cold and hunger...

<F P=106> [Appeal by Association of Democratic Soviets of People's </F>
Deputies of Ukraine and the Democratic Blocs in the Soviets: 
"`The Absence of Self-Government is the Cause of the 
Regionalization of Ukraine'"] 
  [Text] To the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, the 
President of Ukraine, the candidates and deputies of the Supreme 
Soviet of Ukraine and the local soviets of Ukraine at all 
levels: 
  The development of events of late has confirmed that the 
attempts to replace the Moscow center with a Kiev one, with the 
preservation of an extremely centralized system of 
administration, is leading to the further regionalization of 
Ukraine. The tendency of the center to build a new Ukrainian 
state in the old imperial skin without regard for local 
initiatives, to unify the power structure and other aspects of 
local life by any means, the mistrust of the center of the 
inquiries of the localities, the disregard for their specific 
features and the attempts to make use of their specific features 
as effectively as possible for the benefit of the state and 
people are leading to the transformation of regional crises into 
nationwide ones. 
  Owing to the socio-political confrontation of the center and 
the Crimea, the latter has received de facto statehood status, 
although they were only after economic independence at first. 
Owing to the series of conflicts of the Donetsk region with the 
center, the idea of the Donetsk--Krivyy Rih republic of 1918 is 
actually being revived, although in 1991 the Donetsk inhabitants 
made proposals only for the settlement of budgetary issues with 
the center. The center, as we see, does not promote proposals 
for the institution of true--that is, economically 
supported--local self-government, foments conflicts through its 
delays, and then retreats considerably further than it needed to 
when the problem was raised. These actions clearly indicate that 
the efforts of the center are leading to such socio-political 
tension that the situation is being qualitatively changed; 
centrifugal tendencies are being born instead of demands for 
self-government, and when the center is forced to retreat, the 
centrifugal consequences surpass the initial expectations. 
Proceeding from that logic, it is not difficult to predict the 
development of events when the problems that the local areas put 
before the center are resolved. Thet are the creation of the 
Transcarpathian and Odessa free economic zones, the adoption of 
laws on the capital of Ukraine and on megalopolis-cities. The 
local areas have already learned ways of solving their own 
problems based on the example of Crimea and Donetsk. 
  The delays of the center in reforming the decorative system 
of Soviets have given birth to the idea of the regionalization 
of Ukraine and attempts at their constitutional consolidation. 
The center is facing an artificial dilemma--either consolidate 
the state, which is simplistically understood first of all as 
the creation of a rigid executive vertical system, or a forced 
democratization, which in the given context takes on the form of 
a decentralization of power. The apprehensions of the forces of 
statehood naturally make some sense. Decentralization by 
regions, it is true, poses a certain threat to the conciliarity 
of the state, since the territories will gravitate toward 
statehood status. 
  The possibility exists, in our opinion, of combining both 
urgent tasks--the consolidation of the state and the 
democratization (decentralization) of power. It consists of the 
introduction of strong self-government at the level of the 
cities and populated areas, and not territorial (regional) 
self-government. It is namely in these populated areas that the 
people live, and not in the oblast-regions, which arose not out 
of the demands of people, but rather out of the demands for 
convenience of the leadership and the solution of questions of a 
more integral, half-state nature. The self-government of cities 
carries no danger to unity, since the cities are very integrated 
into the adjoining territories and cannot themselves be entities 
of statehood. We have historical experience, where the cities 
were granted the right of self-government in the battle with 
local feudal kings (medieval city self-government--the 
"Madgeburg right"). The self-government of cities was a powerful 
counterweight to the tendency of the feudal lords to secede from 
the state. Bringing the power closer to the people also shows 
more clearly the local economic capabilities, eliminates the 
consumerist "give!" from the local areas to the center and 
develops their initiative--that is, fosters local energy to find 
and realize ways of raising the well-being of their inhabitants. 
We also have the foreign experience of the existence and 
prosperity of the modern economic giants--the United States and 
the FRG--where local self-government is an instrument for the 
strengthening of the state, and not its fragmentation. Every 
city in the United States has its own statute or charter; the 
state defines by constitution the general principles for its 
existence and the rights of citizens, and through laws provides 
conditions for real self-government, first of all through 
budgetary and tax policy. Each city, proceeding from the general 
provisions of the constitution, creates its own system of power 
that is effective for that city, and codifies it by means of the 
aforementioned statute or charter. Local power, structured in an 
identical form for all and thrust upon the cities by the 
Ukrainian center, is ineffective in any city. 
  The association, back during the disputes surrounding the 
Law 
"The Representative of the President," appealed to the Supreme 
Soviet to proceed in nation-building not by strengthening 
executive power alone, with an unbalanced rise in the role of 
judicial authority and monitoring on the part of the people of 
the actions of executive power through the representative 
bodies--the Soviets--elected by them, but also by means of 
bringing self-government closer to world standards as codified 
in the Universal Declaration and European Charter on 
self-government. 
  The current economic and political crisis has shown that the 
center is not handling the tasks of economic and power reform in 
Ukraine, and has to transfer some of the power to the local 
areas, first of all the cities--that is, temporarily introduce 
local self-government--by shifting to the local areas both 
authority and responsibility for the state of the economy and 
the well-being of the inhabitants. If the authorities are unable 
to provide for the people, they are obligated to give them the 
opportunity of providing for themselves--that is, give them 
freedom. And then the task of the state consists only of the 
creation of conditions for the everyday activity of people and 
their security, and in the protection of the socially weak. 
  Adopted by the assemblies of the Association of Democratic 
Soviets of Ukraine and the democratic blocs of the Soviets. 
  By authority of the assemblies, deputy chairman of the 
coordinating council of the Association and deputy of the Kiev 
Soviet Valeriy Rubtsov 
  13 January 1994, City of Slavsk

Market Reforms: "Causes of the Crisis, or Policy as a Millstone 
of the Economy"] 
  [Text] When asked why the Soviet Union disappeared from 
political history, I would answer this way: Because of the 
inability of its economic system to cope with the economic 
crisis, which started approximately 1980-1981. In those years 
the average annual rate of growth of the gross social product 
fell from 3.0-3.5 percent to 1.5-1.8 percent. But beginning 
1991, the rate of growth became negative (about 5 percent per 
year), and after 1992 ailments of the crisis came to light with 
the beginning of the structural, inflationary, and 
monetary-financial stresses that forced hitherto slumbering 
sociopolitical forces to stir. 
  The reasons for such a long-term crisis are the internal 
contradictions of the system of economic management that was 
built in the years of the Stalin-Brezhnev regime. The crisis 
became an expression of the disparity between the macrostructure 
of production and the macrostructure of consumption, the 
disparity between the proportion of distribution of social 
capital according to branches and the needs of its productive 
functioning, disparity in the level of applied technologies in 
small and large systems and the demands that the modern world 
economy poses. 
  The crisis bares these disproportions and technological 
backwardness, and gives society and the nation the chance to 
engage in a search for a solution and to dismantle an obsolete 
economy and transform it into a new and highly technological one 
with a progressive structure. But this is only a chance. The 
question is how and when we can take advantage of it. 
  For the time being, there is no answer to the first part of 
the question. The crisis is proceeding as a destructive 
phenomenon, wrecking enterprises and lowering the standard of 
living of the population. It is an unprecedented phenomenon in 
the speed of the drop in production, 9 percent. It is also 
unprecedented in the depth of the decline (30 percent in these 
years): This is 1.5 times more than in the great U.S. depression 
at the end of the 1920's. According to the branch spectrum, the 
drop in production was highest in the fuel complex 
(approximately 45 percent, and something like this is fully 
justified) and in the sphere of everyday services to the 
population (more than 50 percent). Right after them come light 
and furniture industries (40 and 37 percent, respectively), and 
agriculture. 
  This assortment of the most injured branches makes it 
possible to assume that not only structural disproportions and 
technological backwardness are to blame for their crash, but 
also other reasons that do not result from the objective 
preconditions of the crisis. 
  If we are talking about the consumer goods and services 
branches, the course of the crisis in them was essentially 
deepened by a sharp drop in the effective demand of the 
population. The level of real incomes of the population fell in 
the last three years by a minimum of 35 percent. But inasmuch as 
the people's monetary savings practically dwindled (the 
remaining deposits in banks in real calculations were reduced by 
a factor of no less than 10-12), the effective demand fell by a 
factor of two. 
  The population's demand also has a structural cross-section. 
While up to 1991 the majority of the population had moderately 
low incomes that basically met the standards of "Soviet" goods 
and services, by the end of 1993 the majority of the population 
(most of all the unemployed and those working in state 
enterprises) began to receive extremely low incomes with which 
people were not in a position to acquire domestically produced 
goods. This accelerated the drop in the latter, and commodity 
turnover began to be filled by high-quality imported products 
and items intended, however, only for 5-8 percent of the most 
well-off people in our society. 
  Why did this happen? Why were efforts not made to support 
the 
incomes of our fellow citizens and support production and the 
demand for products, which were not satisfied? Why were there 
principal failures in these key points of our system? Moreover, 
as we see, the drop in consumer incomes accelerates the drop in 
the output of products for the population, and the reduction in 
goods and services devalues people's money and incomes. In a 
general case, this may be the answer: The organization of the 
national economy was not reformed, and the organization of the 
activity of individual enterprises was not reformed. 
  In the Soviet system, the main direction of financial 
redistribution was for the benefit of branches of heavy 
industry. This kind of organization of public financing, in 
fact, continues to operate right now. Light industry and 
agricultural branches remain the stepchildren in the family of 
the state economy. But the organizational backwardness of the 
enterprises predetermines excessive costs and the need for their 
noneconomic and nonmarket financing (this is the root of the 
escalation of inflation). 
  However, there is one more powerful factor. This is the 
nonequivalence of turnover with countries that are not members 
of the CIS. The payments balance in this direction is obviously 
positive. Moreover, a large part of the hard currency earnings 
of our exporters does not return to Ukraine. This has already 
been going on for several years. In 1993 only 20 percent of the 
expected foreign hard currency from exports came into the 
country. The annual pumping out of billion-dollar sums reduces 
the possible standard of living of the people by about 15-20 
percent. 
  In aggregate, the financial-credit, export-hard currency 
factors, and the monopolism of the commodity producers incite a 
price inflation that is unprecedented in postwar Europe (it is 
higher only in warring Serbia). In 1992 the level of inflation 
reached 4,000 percent (up by a factor of 40 for the year, 
averaging 35 percent per month), and in 1993--9,000 percent (up 
by a factor of 90 for the year--45 percent per month). 
  We will note that in its nature, an economic crisis in the 
downturn phase (that is, as we have now in Ukraine) lowers the 
absolute price level, and only relative prices increase. The 
inflationary dynamics of prices naturally is the dynamics of 
relative prices. The question arises: How are the crisis and 
inflation correlated? And does inflation not have an effect on 
the ability to overcome the economic crisis? 
  If it is taken into account that the inflationary high price 
dynamic does not permit the implementation of operations to 
renew fixed capital, not to mention the new construction of 
industrial or transportation facilities, it becomes clear that 
inflation is a very serious barrier to structural reorganization 
in social production on the path to pulling out of the crisis. 
But if inflation is at an extremely high level (more than 50 
percent a month), it is not only a barrier but also an 
independently operating destructive factor. 
  In completing the picture of the economic crisis in Ukraine, 
taking into account the hyperinflationary trends, it can be said 
that the decline in production has still not reached its very 
lowest magnitude. If it is not possible to defeat 
hyperinflation, the minimum volume of production in the 
long-term cyclical crisis we are experiencing will get lower and 
lower. It is possible to suppose that by balancing between the 
different interests the current government will be able to 
maintain average rates of inflation in 1994 at the mark of 55-65 
percent per month. Consequently, technological renewal and 
structural changes will not be started. The introduction of new 
organizational forms of economic management in enterprises, 
evidently, should also not be expected from the government of 
Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy. Under such conditions, stabilization of 
the volume of production will also become impossible--the drop 
in the volume of gross domestic product for the year will to all 
appearances amount to not less than 15-20 percent. 
  Thus, the crisis we are experiencing does not have some kind 
of "bottom" (a low point in the decline) that is preset in 
advance. We can achieve stabilization and begin the climb 
earlier and from a higher point, or later and with an ever lower 
and lower wrecked "production platform." The role of the 
Government of Ukraine in curbing or aggravating the breakdown of 
the economy is becoming increasingly significant. 
  A great deal depends on when the change in today's 
government 
will occur and whether its new staff will be capable of starting 
anticrisis operations. Policy is again a millstone on the 
economy. However, it is already clear now that the first half of 
1994 in any case will inherit the inertia of the preceding 
period (the very same government strategists are developing the 
programs and budget). That is, the drop in production and the 
periodic multiple jumps in prices will continue. In the second 
half of the year, if the new unified reform budget of the 
Cabinet of Ministers begins to work, the drop in the volume of 
production will decrease somewhat (up to 8-10 percent), and 
inflation can be reduced substantially--by a factor of two to 
three. In addition, there will be an upswing in wages and 
pensions. But by the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995, the 
economy should achieve a lower point of decline. After this, 
stabilization and a rise in production will start. How long the 
preparations and the beginning of the upswing will take will be 
determined by the effectiveness of the reforms, and most of all 
by whether the Ukrainian monetary unit will be convertible and 
whether privatization of state enterprises will be implemented. 
  It should also be said that not all state enterprises will 
be 
able to survive the long-term economic blow (idle capacities, 
departure of qualified workers, contraction of the assortment of 
products, and the chronic credit indebtedness against the 
background of hyperinflation). Some of them will not be restored 
in their former capacity. This will create the preconditions for 
high social costs--unemployment and inadequate budget resources 
for large investment, ecological, or social programs. The 
government will be obliged to provide for such consequences of 
the crisis in its programs. 
  As for the private sector, after the economy reaches the low 
point of the decline, and given price stabilization, it will 
receive very favorable opportunities for growth in Ukraine. 
Favorable conditions will be associated with difficulties in the 
state sector and the absence of competition. For this reason 
there will be a wide selection of manpower, and low prices for 
equipment, building, and land parcels. Because of the totally 
unsettled situation there will not be many foreign investments, 
and it will be necessary to rely on our own capital. The 
greatest opportunities will open up for multiprofiled private 
firms and privatized enterprises that will engage in the 
acquisition of new markets. Their faster development will also 
become the main source of the economic upswing in 1995.

<F P=106> [Article by Urve Repp: "Financial Ministry Satisfied With </F>
Past Year"] 
  [Text] 
  Summarizing the past financial year, Finance Minister 
Madis uurike said that a rather strict financial 
policy 
has been followed and efforts made to balance the budget. In 
cooperation with Bank of Estonia, the rate of inflation has been 
slowed down. "To some extent, we also had to police the 
economy," the minister remarked. 
<H5>  Economy Has Stabilized Significantly </H5>
  Even though inflation is still high, it has been brought 
down 
from 900 to 35 percent, compared to 1992. 
  uurike said that stabilization of the economy 
is also 
evident from loan policies. Right now, loans are geared 
primarily to investments. Due to that, several necessary loans 
have been obtained, since the state budget has very little money 
allocated for investments. 
  To liven up investments, a state investment program has been 
created, the listing for which spans several years and exceeds 
23 million kroons. 
  Last year, loans totalling $109 million were taken out, and 
$63 million of it put to use. These loans were used to support 
banking, heating plants and local governments. Last year, 6 
million ECU's and 73.5 million German marks were received from 
the Europeam Community for the development of energetics. Loans 
have also been used to solve transport-related and environmental 
problems. 
  The direction of foreign aid has also changed, according to 
uurike. There is more talk now about cooperative 
projects, as discussions on crises have disappeared. The biggest 
loans have been received from the European Community, Germany, 
Sweden, Finland and Italy. 
  The foreign aid total for 1992 was 1.1 billion kroons, and 
it 
has continued at the same level through 1993. Aid is given 
primarily for carrying out projects, and not as cash grants. 
<H5>  Last Year's Revenues Smaller Than Anticipated </H5>
  The 1993 base budget called for 4.3 billion kroons, but 
actual proceeds were 100 million kroons lower than anticipated. 
The budget deficit was due to poor collections in several tax 
areas, said deputy chancellor Tiit Saat. Even local governments 
did not come up with the budgeted amounts. Proceeds from Tallinn 
fell short by 60 million, from Maardu by 27 million, and from 
Narva by 10 million kroons. Because of the budget shortfall, 
investments ran at a lower level than planned. 
  Tiit Saat said that many problems were encountered in 
preparing the 1994 budget. District governments are not happy 
with the excessive dependence of local budgets on the state 
budget. This year's plans call for supporting local governments, 
and for making allocations to districts from the state budget. 
  Saat thinks that the 1994 financial year will turn out to be 
quite complicated. A vigorous search is on for coming up with 
additional funds to meet the budget. 
<H5>  Supplementary Budgets Not Being Planned </H5>
  At the end of last year, after the state budget bill was 
passed by Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament] Valve Kirsipuu, 
chairman of the parliamentary budget and taxation commission, 
spoke of the need for a supplementary budget to raise the 
pension amounts. The word from the finance ministry to 
PaEVALEHT was that there can be no talk of supplementary 
budgets, unless additional sources of revenue are found. 
Additional sources could be created by raising taxes, and that 
is not up to the ministry. No supplementary budget will be 
created, at least not during the first quarter. 
  Employees of agencies on state payroll had their wages 
increased 1.5 times, yet funds could not be found to raise the 
pension amounts, which have been eroded considerably by 
inflation. Enn Pant, chancellor of the finance ministry, said 
that this is a case of different orders of magnitude, and that 
became the deciding factor in this instance.

<F P=106> [Article by Marek Dreving: "President Approved Changes in </F>
Government Staffing"] 
  [Text] 
  President Lennart Meri, in his presentation before 
Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament] yesterday, said that he will 
confirm all the ministerial appointments submitted by Prime 
Minister Mart Laar, even though he has reservations about the 
proposed `overhaul' of the government. 
  Before signing the document, Lennart Meri said that, in 
these 
critical times, state interest must prevail over personal and 
factional considerations. The president linked this requirement 
to the NATO summit meeting taking place at Brussels. 
  The president said that innovations in the government have 
been made at the wrong time and in the wrong manner. 
  Meri signed the resolution on changes in government staffing 
at the lectern in front of Riigikogu. The president preferred 
not to take questions from members of the parliament. 
  The president's statement to Riigikogu in connection with 
the 
overhaul in the government's staffing is published in full in 
today's issue of PaEVALEHT. 
<H5>  Mart Laar: President's Speech Made Several Valid Points </H5>
  Prime Minister Mart Laar said at the press conference that 
he 
still does not know if `the president has declared war on him 
him or not.' 
  "I have not declared war on the president," Laar maintained. 
  Laar also recalled that at meetings held between the prime 
minister and representatives of parliamentary factions, before 
the government `overhaul' took place, "the president did not 
express his opinion in such scathing tones." 
  "The president's speech in Riigikogu made a number of valid 
points, especially those referring to the tug-of-war between 
Estonia's fictional characters Andres and Pearu," Laar conceded. 
  At the same time, Laar did not agree with the president's 
contention that the `overhaul' was undertaken at the wrong time, 
and in the wrong manner. Even presuming that Estonia is in for 
tough times, it would still be better to face them with a 
government that works in harmony, cooperates efficiently with 
the parliament, and can pass all resolutions effectively," the 
prime minister opined. 
  "We still have huge gaps in our legislation," the prime 
minister said. Laar referred to the lack of several laws that 
would guarantee the balance of powers and added that passing the 
law for regulating the president's duties, now up for its second 
reading in Riigikogu, and the peace-time law of state defense, 
would make it possible to resolve the issues now being debated. 
  Commenting on the crisis that ensued, Laar said that even 
legal experts from Germany had pointed out deficiencies in 
Estonia's constitution. 
  "This is why it is possible that some changes will have to 
be 
made in the constitution," Laar said.

<F P=106> [Article by Kadi Heinsalu: "Foreign Aid To Agriculture"] </F>
  [Text] 
  Besides the World Bank loan, Estonia's agriculture is 
also supported by several foreign funds created with proceeds 
from the sale of aid shipments from the countries involved, said 
Ruve Shank, director of foreign relations at the Ministry of 
Agriculture. 
  The World Bank has extended two so-called shopping loans to 
help Estonia's agriculture, the first of which arrived to 
support agriculture with $5 million in 1992. Last year, the 
World Bank supported Estonia with the so-called Japanese loan, 
the distribution of which is taking place now. 
  In addition to these, Shank said, foreign aid funds have 
been 
created in Estonia by three other countries and the European 
Community. Some of the funds distribute proceeds from the sale 
of shipments as grants, others offer loans on favorable terms. 
  "The money of the first of these, the U.S. fund, has been 
distributed and has begun to bring in interest on the loans," 
Shank remarked. The fund created on the basis of 100,000 tonnes 
of feed grain shipped to Estonia in 1992, has been used to 
credit private enterprise in agriculture. The 25 million kroons 
received from the sale of grain were lent mostly to farmers at 7 
percent annual interest. 
  Two years ago, grain assistance was used to create the 
European Community fund, with 75 percent of its sales proceeds 
going to support agriculture. "In contrast to regulations for 
the U.S. fund, this money--30 million kroons--is being 
distributed to some of the better projects in rural enterprise 
as a non-returnable loan," Shank explained, adding that the 
competition is still on, and this is why the EC fund continues 
to have great significance this year. 
  "In the third place, by volume, is the Italian fund, also 
with 30 million kroons," Shank continued. By now, it has 
accumulated 14 million kroons, one half of which will be lent at 
a 12.5 percent annual interest to develop rural enterprise, and 
the other half given as grants to state structures, including 
support to state collectives, agricultural schools and the 
Ministry of Agriculture. 
  Making up the smallest part of the volume, 4 million kroons, 
is the German fund based on spare parts for agricultural 
machinery shipped here a few years ago. "So far, less than one 
third of them have been sold, and thus the significance of this 
fund in supporting agriculture not particularly significant," 
Shank remarked. 
  Shank said that assistance through funds will, in the near 
future, be replaced by a system of loans at favorable interest 
rates. "We have been negotiating with the German government, the 
World Bank and Japan are also willing to lend money, instead of 
granting it."

<F P=106> [Article by Karmo Kaas: "New Economics Minister Is </F>
Interested in Cooperation"] 
  Economics minister Toivo Jurgenson said that he 
cannot criticize the present Ministry of Economics for having 
deviated from the government's economic policy, but he is not 
satisfied with the results of privatization and new legislation 
in the area of economics. 
  Jurgenson said that the work of the economics 
ministry 
has drawn a lot of media noise lately. The government, in its 
current activity, is bound by the coalition agreement and the 
economic principles specified therein. And, since the economics 
ministry is part of the government apparatus it, too, will be 
bound by the same principles in its daily activity. 
  "In my contacts, so far, with the top management of the 
ministry, and also in the practical work of the ministry, I have 
noticed no deviations from the government's platform of economic 
policies," Jurgenson said. "One of Isamaa's [leading 
faction 
Fatherland] lines of economic policy is the open economy 
principle, the implementation of which requires both competence 
and courage and, in that respect, the economics ministry is 
beyond reproach. 
  Speaking of the process of administering and privatizing 
state enterprises, the economics minister favored the idea of 
forming administrative groups, and exercising the owner's role 
through them. 
<H5>  Government's Teamwork Was Hampered </H5>
  Toivo Jurgenson felt that much could be said about 
the 
tactics of carrying out economic policy and the realities of 
life. Presumably, most of the people want to see privatization 
take hold as soon as possible, to foster the fast and massive 
development of enterprise based on private property. This 
development could even be faster, if it weren't for all the 
problems that started to pop up around the economics ministry. 
"Privatization is a delicate and complicated process, and if 
people involved cannot reach an agreement on the most elementary 
level on how to function as a team, then one can say that 
something is rotten," Jurgenson said. 
  He noted that he cannot blame any specific agencies or 
individuals, nor can he point to any specific shortcomings in 
the process of privatization or acquisition of private housing, 
but he is not satisfied with the results achieved todate. 
  The effectiveness of the ministry's work could also be 
measured by the number of legislative acts submitted to the 
government or processed by Riigikogu [Estonia's parliament]. The 
economics ministry has made a conservative showing in this area 
but, here too, it is difficult to state clearly why this is so. 
"I have formed my own opinion on this, thinking that one of the 
reasons could be the inability within the government to agree on 
the structural principles of legislation dealing with 
enterprise," Jurgenson said. "It is not clear, however, 
what 
kinds of laws are needed, and what kind of internal structure 
they should have." 
  He added that sending legislative bills from the government 
to Riigikogu again requires teamwork on the part of the 
government, which has been severely hampered by conflicts 
between the economic and financial ministries, and also between 
the ministries for finance and justice. 
  Jurgenson saw negotiations with the Ministry of 
Finance 
and other ministries as one of the first tasks to be tackled, so 
as to get a better definition of areas to be covered by each of 
the ministries. 
<H5>  Economics Minister Has No Wish to Change the Team </H5>
  Toivo Jurgenson maintained that his goal as economics 
minister is to improve the ministry's work in the area of 
legislation, and to contribute to a faster and more massive 
implementation of privatization. 
  The new economics minister wants to pay more attention than 
was done previously to privatization outside the capital city. 
  Jurgenson said that he is ready to work with the 
present 
team at the Ministry of Economics provided, of course, that this 
is what the employees want. The executive apparatus of the 
ministry should work, regardless of the changes taking place in 
the government. "One thing is clear, however, there is room for 
only one politician at the ministry," the economics minister 
said. 
  Jurgenson admitted that passions have been 
overheated in 
the course of the government 'overhaul' and that 
over-politization of some business circles has pushed him 'up 
against the wall.' "I try to see it from the human point of view 
and hope that the business circles mentioned did not, to the 
very end, understand what they did," Jurgenson said. "If I 
were a businessman and wanted to express my political views, I 
would start a political party." 
  The minister added that he wants to continue constructive 
cooperation with the business circles that opposed his 
nomination. 
  "In this sense, I am a pragmatist and will not go snooping 
to 
find out who signed what political petition," Jurgenson 
said. 
<H5>  Toivo Jurgesnson (36) </H5>
  Graduated, in 1980, from the highway and bridge construction 
section of TPI [Tallinn Polytechnical Institute], specializing 
in building bridges. 
  After his graduation, worked in different structures of the 
Tallinn city government, most of the time as chief engineer for 
the technical construction board of the city government. In this 
position, Jurgenson was involved in all engineering and 
technical aspects of construction, including engineering 
preparations for the new housing projects (Lasnamae, 
oismae), and the construction of all bridges and 
tunnels 
ordered by the city government. Jurgenson considers the 
construction of the overpass across the Parnu highway to 
be 
the high point of his building career. 
  In 1986, Jurgenson was asked to continue the work he 
did 
for Tallinn on the national scale, and joined the planning 
committee of that time. 
  In 1989, the current economics minister joined the 
construction firm Rave where, by his own admission, he had his 
first exposure to building according to internationally accepted 
standards. 
  Jurgenson became more involved in the problems of 
economic policy in 1988, when the Christian Democratic Party was 
created, and formation of the party's economic program began. 
  In 1992, he was elected to Riigikogu on the Isamaa 
[Fatherland] ticket, and his year-and-a-half on the 
parliamentary commission on economics has, according to 
Jurgenson, given him the interesting experience of coming 
up 
with legislation in the area of economics. He has also 
participated in problem solving for Bank of Estonia and some 
state enterprises like RAS Eesti Lennujaamad [RAS Estonia's 
Airports] and energy companies.

<F P=106> [Article by Viesturs Pauls Karnups: "The Citizenship Law of </F>
the Republic of Latvia and the Fate of the Latvian People."] 
  [Text] It is no secret nor revelation that the Latvian 
people are being faced with a demographic catastrophe. The goal 
of our generation is to prevent a worsening of the present 
situation and make some attempts so that at least our children's 
children shall not inherit a situation worse that what we have 
today. This is a difficult goal, and it will be essential to use 
all of our strength in order to make this happen. 
  One of the basic principles, which could have a significant 
impact on the situation, is the adoption of a citizenship law 
favorable to the Latvian people. It is not a secret to anyone 
that the citizenship law involves many important questions. It 
includes a wide spectrum of problems, not only on the 
demographic situation of Latvians, but also on the status of the 
colonists brought into Latvia during the occupation. And there 
is also the gradual repatriation of these colonists and the 
promotion of emigration, as well as many other current problems. 
The subject of this article will be the relationship between the 
citizenship law and the question of the survival of the Latvia 
people. 
  Before delving into the matter of the citizenship law, I 
would like to familiarize you with some figures describing the 
current situation: 
  According to the residents' registry data, which have been 
entered into the computer data bank, we see the following 
picture: 
  1. Registered residents of Latvia: 2,410,763. 
  Among this number: 
  -- Latvian citizens: 1,355,259 -- 78.8% 
  -- citizens of other nationalities: 365,043 -- 21.2%; 
  -- total -- 1,720,302 -- 100%. 
  2. Registered Latvians who are not citizens of the Latvian 
state: 21,555; 
  -- together with citizens -- Latvians --1,376,814 -- 
79%; 
  -- all citizens combined -- 1,741,857. 
  3. It can be estimated that the category of non-citizens to 
be naturalized outside the quota (excepting Latvians) would 
increase the number of citizens through the naturalization 
process by --180,000; 
  -- all citizens combined -- 1,921,857. 
  4. If the number of Latvians in the total citizenship body 
does not change (1,376,814 resp.), then the proportion of 
Latvians in the total citizenship body will decline to 
71.6%. 
  5. If we include those born in the Latvian SSR, who are not 
Latvian state citizens and who do not belong to the number 
outside the quota -- 213,250, then the total citizenship body of 
the Latvian state is 2,135,107, and the proportion of Latvians 
in the total citizenship body declines to 64.5/%. 
  6. If we include the number of those who entered the Latvian 
SSR until 1983, who are not citizens of Latvia, and who are not 
part of the number outside the quota -- approximately 200,000, 
then the total number of Latvian state citizens becomes 
2,335,107, and the proportion of Latvians in the total 
citizenship body would decline to 59%. 
  It is evident that such a picture, from the viewpoint of the 
survival of the Latvian people, is very sad. Over the normal 
course, the natural population growth rate of the Latvian 
people, i.e. the rate of generation change over, will remain 
under 2.1. Thus, every citizen who is not a Latvian reduces the 
proportion of Latvians in the total citizenship body, and along 
with this, increases the threat that Latvia, in the best case, 
will become a dual-community state. This perspective is most 
dangerous to the survival of the Latvian people. This risk was 
confirmed by a certain study in 1992[.sup]1[/] concerning the 
adaption of foreigners (Russians) to Latvia. The results 
confirmed that foreigners in a Latvian community did not adapt 
themselves, they did not become accustomed, nor did they wish to 
become accustomed, but wanted to live in Latvia within their own 
community. 
  After 50 years of occupation, the Latvian people have 
assimilated, to a certain extent, in the direction of the 
Russian people. During the occupation of Latvia, a comfortable 
community was created for the Russia people, but not for the 
Latvians. This means that the possibilities to integrate such a 
large mass of colonists into the Latvian community are minimal, 
because, first of all, such a Latvian community must be created, 
i.e. it is necessary to turn the Latvians away from the 
influence of the Russian people and towards their own people. 
Only when the Latvian community has been established, more or 
less, can we talk about the integration of non-Latvians. 
  The deciding role here is played by the citizenship law. In 
a 
normal society, the acquisition of citizenship is a very 
individualized and long-term process, and it cannot be 
accomplished in mass style. There is a critical moment when an 
individual has decided to commit his and his family's future to 
the state where he has been a long-term resident, and in which 
he has become so integrated that he feels more comfortable and 
more apart of its social and cultural community than that of the 
country from which he originated. The acquisition of citizenship 
is the culmination point of the integration process. 
  In Latvia, there is a desire to start this process in a 
manner completely opposite from what is generally accepted 
elsewhere. The acquisition of citizenship is considered as the 
beginning of integration, and there are attempts to convince us 
that only after citizenship has been granted, can we hope to 
integrate the large mass of colonists. It is quite obvious 
that we will not be able to integrate into the Latvian 
community, which at present only exists formally, and is not a 
reality, 500,000 colonists. It is more plausible that quite the 
opposite will happen, that the russification of the Latvian 
people will continued in earnest. When this happens, we will be 
unable to claim our human rights because we have voluntarily 
agreed to these developments. 
  The Latvian National Independence Movement (LNIM) has 
consistently supported the viewpoint that the proportion of 
Latvians in the total citizenship body should not be allowed to 
fall below 75%, if we want to provide for the existence 
of the 
Latvian people and the development of the Latvian state. In 
practice, this would mean that general naturalization should 
only occur after many years. From our standpoint, the 
citizenship law question is a political question, not 
a question of integration or loyalty to the Latvian sate. It 
is essential that political and economic power remains in the 
hands of the Latvian people, because the Latvia people do not 
have another country of their own. It is not a matter of how 
well or poorly the Latvians can realize this power, since Latvia 
is the only country that the Latvians have, whose future should 
be shaped by the Latvian people, not by people who have been 
systematically relocated as a result of some other country's 
politics. 
  Therefore, the citizenship law of the Republic of Latvia is 
not merely a mechanism for dealing with the relationships 
between non-citizens and the state, but also the cornerstone for 
determining the fate of the Latvian people. Today, we are faced 
with a choice. It is a question of whether we will attempt to 
guarantee the survival of the Latvia people, or 
whether we will decide that our children shall live, as I 
mentioned earlier -- in the best case -- in a dual-community 
state, or -- in the worst case -- in a russified province of 
Russia. We have no other choices because the caravan is 
beginning to move on. 
  What can we do right now to move the caravan in a direction 
that would be in our favor? Despite the unfavorable statistics, 
there are a few things that we can do. 
  1. Using all the means available to the state, we could 
promote repatriation of the Latvia people back to Latvia, and 
the voluntary immigration of non-citizens to foreign countries. 
I am purposefully using the term "foreign countries", because 
just as many non-citizens would gladly immigrate in the western 
direction as repatriate to the east. That would also mean that 
we must involve western countries for immigration (for example, 
the USA, Canada, Australia, etc.), so that they could establish 
specific immigration programs in which they would agree to 
accept a given number of colonists from Latvia within their 
general immigration quotas. We will have to deal with the 
repatriation of Latvians back to Latvia ourselves. 
  2. Within the citizenship law, it must be clearly and simply 
stated that the naturalization quotas will only be minimal, and 
that the beginning of generalized naturalization should not be 
expected, neither in the near future nor even sometime in the 
foreseeable future. In principle, non-citizens would be given 
two choices, respectively, either to emigrate or to continue 
living in Latvia as a foreigner. 
  3. All efforts should be concentrated on fortifying the 
establishment of a Latvian community in Latvia, and, as I 
mentioned earlier, to return Latvians in the direction of their 
people. I am speaking here about derussification, 
which, until now, has not be included among the famous three 
"D's". Latvian identity, etc., will not be found by shouting or 
contemplating one's navel. The Latvian community, first of all, 
is based on the Latvian language. When every student who 
graduates from school in Latvia will be totally fluent in the 
Latvian language, regardless of his nationality, then we have a 
Latvian community we can start talking about. Everything else 
will follow as a natural result. 
  In ending, I would once again like to stress the 
cornerstones. 
  First, the demographic situation of the Latvian people does 
not allow for generalized naturalization any time soon. 
  Second, it is essential to create a Latvian community in 
Latvia, in order to insure the survival of the Latvian people, 
regardless of the regulations in the citizenship law. 
  Third, with all of our power, we must promote the 
repatriation of Latvians and the voluntary emigration of 
non-citizens. 
  Thank you for your attention,

<F P=106> [Article by Aisma Coka, Head Visa Inspector: "Immigration </F>
Waves Continue: Door is Wide Open] 
  [Text]I work at the visa department of the Department 
of Citizenship and Immigration for the Vidzeme suburb, and I 
would like to describe the problems I am faced with 
everyday. 
  We shouldn't be pampering any illusions that the bill 
adopted 
at the first reading of the Citizenship Law, as developed by the 
Latvian Way and Farmers Union, will save the Latvian people 
--protect them from further assimilation into the mass of 
foreign immigrants, or promote the welfare of the native people 
of Latvia. In my opinion, the most dangerous section of the bill 
is chapter 2 on naturalization quotas, which are to be 
determined every year by the government. It looks like we have 
missed the train once again, because at present, just like 
during the stagnation years of the recent past, large numbers of 
foreign citizens are arriving in Latvia every day. Some of them 
(honest and dishonest) are attempting to legalize their stay in 
Latvia using various means. Others, who have been successful in 
illegally crossing the border, or whose visa has expired or 
whose permit to stay has expired and have no grounds for an 
extension, instead of returning to their place of permanent 
residence, remain in Latvia illegally and are actively engaged 
in private business activities. The only attempts at dealing 
with the problem of foreigners illegally living in Latvia are 
being made by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, 
which was created two years ago. Other state institutions, such 
as the Latvian police, for example, who, in accordance with the 
law, should be concerned about expelling violators of 
immigration regulations from the state, show no interest in this 
matter. A violator of the regulations receives an order to 
leave, signs a statement that he will leave the territory of 
Latvia within a seven day period... and continues to walk to 
streets of Riga, because the police structure has not created a 
mechanism through which this matter could be followed up. 
  The procedure for issuing a visa 
  In accordance with resolution 90, passed by the Council of 
Ministers of the Republic of Latvia on February 19, 1993, any 
citizen of Latvia, or any foreigner who is permanently 
registered in Latvia and whose passport contains the "Resident 
registry stamp" and personal code number has the right to 
complete an INVITATION form, with which he can invite relatives, 
friends, acquaintances from other countries to visit. Of course, 
approximately one half of Riga's residents are foreigners who 
illegally entered Latvia during the soviet era, and almost 
everyone of them has a vast circle of friends and relatives in 
the CIS countries. These foreigners registered in Latvia make up 
the majority of our clients. It should be added that recently, 
for reasons unknown, the Latvian mass media and along with this, 
also the public, have popularized the term "permanent resident", 
which is used to described citizens of the USSR living in 
Latvia. This term is totally misleading because such a concept 
is not contained in any legislative act of the Republic of 
Latvia, nor has any such category of persons been defined, for 
whom such a term could be applied for legal purposes. All of 
these people, who, from June 17, 1940 up until July 1, 1992, 
illegally, i.e. against the wishes of the Latvian citizenship 
body, entered Latvia to take up residence contain in their 
passports the information that they are citizens or subjects of 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. As we know, for many 
international rights questions after 1991, the legal heir to the 
USSR is Russia, which is why the body of people described could 
be considered as citizens of Russia, of course, provided that 
they do not posses documents proving citizenship of another 
country. In any case, these people have the status of 
foreigners in Latvia, not of permanent residents. 
  Furthermore, when a Latvian citizen or foreigner registered 
in Latvia has completed the INVITATION, the visa department 
confirms it, and on the basis of this document, the Latvian 
embassies abroad receive entry visas for private visits. A 
private visa is issued for a requested period of time, but not 
longer than for 3 months. In a normal situation, the foreigner 
returns home to his permanent country of residence at the end of 
the private visit. Unfortunately, the situation here is 
completely different. Large numbers of foreigners enter Latvia 
every day, and, after expiration of the visa intended for their 
visit, attempt, by whatever means, to gain the right to remain 
permanently in Latvia. What is so attractive about Latvia for 
foreigners? It is our disorganized legislation and economy. If 
the person who has entered Latvia is successful in extending the 
visa or receiving a permit to stay, he takes advantage of the 
situation created by the Latvian government in which immigrants, 
in terms of economic activities, are placed in a 
considerably more privileged situation than citizens 
of Latvia. And, of course, the foreigner who has come here is 
very quickly hired by some private company registered in Latvia, 
usually as a procuring agent, because the company needs people 
with a wide circle of acquaintances or extensive contacts in 
Russia and other CIS countries. These foreigners continuously 
travel to the CIS countries, back and forth, bringing in various 
goods and selling them in Latvia for inflated prices. 
  Every day, large numbers of foreigners arrive in Latvia 
for 3 months, and can be relatively easily divided into 4 
groups. 
  The first group is numerically the largest, and includes 
foreigners who live in Latvia and their spouses who are citizens 
of other countries and arrive to join their family and to remain 
to live in Latvia, although a majority of those who come own 
apartments and even houses in Russia (CIS). These persons are 
ignoring the law adopted by our state "On foreigners and those 
who are not citizens of any country who arrive and remain in the 
Republic of Latvia", which went into effect on July 1, 1992, and 
the regulation confirmed by the Council of Ministers on May 19 
of this year on the issuing of permits for stay. These 
legislative acts state that permits for stay must be obtained by 
all foreigners who wish to remain in Latvia for more than 3 
months, and that these permits must be requested from the 
Latvian embassies or consular offices (consulates) 
abroad. 
  The spouses of foreigners take an easier road of defiance. 
Again, through falsification and lying that they are only 
coming for a visit, they request an entry visa for 3 
months, and, after spending a pleasant time within their family 
circle, they give notice that they are not going anywhere 
because this is where their wife (or husband) and children are. 
It turns out that, prior to arriving here, the foreigner left 
his job and officially gave up the previous place of residence. 
Thus, the poor person has nowhere to go. The foreigners are 
going around from Pontius to Pilate to show that they are being 
discriminated against. Those who come here are not concerned 
about unemployment, nor about not knowing the state language, 
nor their lack of a legal means of support. 
  The court system, which should be protecting the interests 
and rights of citizens of the Republic of Latvia, is involved 
with examining the complaints of those who have come here 
illegally. Foreigners are now suing, not only to receive the 
"resident registry stamp" in their passport, but also to 
legalize the presence of their spouses in Latvia. I haven't 
heard about any cases being brought to court concerning the 
activities of dishonest workers in the resident registries of 
the Latgale or Vidzeme suburbs, who have received money to 
register foreigners as residents or citizens, when, in fact, 
they are not qualified to be registered as such. 
  The second is an elderly group, consisting of mothers and 
fathers who have come from Russia or the CIS to visit their well 
situated children -- foreigners registered in Latvia -- and 
remain here to live. Also this group of travelers should have 
applied for permits of stay at the embassies before coming over, 
but they have requested visit visas for a period of 3 months and 
cross the Latvian boarder. Afterwards, their children obtain 
from clinics and hospitals either legal or fictive doctors' 
notes, which are not validated neither by the acknowledgement of 
the commission of physicians, nor by the signature and stamp of 
the chief physician. Sometimes, it is a mystery of how these 
people managed to come to Latvia while suffering with such an 
array of diseases. What is interesting is that within 3 months, 
their diseases and chronic conditions have progressed so 
severely that these people are prevented from leaving. It can be 
assumed that these people are not concerned with the problem of 
pensions, nor any other types of hardships. The children of 
these old people are persistent in their fight to receive the 
permit of stay. 
  The third group includes foreigners who come to Latvia 
supposedly on a visit, but are actually here to engage in 
marriage and remain to live in Latvia. 
  Unfortunately, in accordance with the present legislation, a 
foreigner who is in Latvia on a visa can register for marriage. 
If someone who has just come here marries a citizen of Latvia, 
in accordance with the immigration law, this person can request 
and obtain a permit of stay for one year, after which it can be 
extended to 4 years, and after 5 years -- receive a permit 
for permanent stay. Very often, the marriages between 
persons of foreign nationality and citizens of Latvia are 
FICTIVE, concluded for the purpose of obtaining a permit to stay 
in Latvia (obviously, in a situation where the income for the 
majority of citizens of Latvia borders on minimum subsistence, 
citizens are forced to agree to such fictive marriages in order 
to earn some additional income). In practice, our workers have 
come upon the situation where one married spouse does not know 
the other spouse's date of birth, residential address, or even 
the proper spelling of the last name (in many cases, the spouses 
retain their own last names). 
  The fourth group consists of political and economic 
refugees from CIS hot "spots". They join relatives or 
friends here, hiding the true reasons for coming, and often 
mention contracts for work or study in Latvia as the reason for 
their proposed stay in Latvia. 
  In this respect, I would like to examine the Riga Civil 
Aviation University. This institution is a magnet for 
foreigners. This "Alma mater" attracts a large number of 
students from the Transcaucasian republics, who arrive here with 
their entire families (wives, children, fathers, mothers). I 
cannot neglect to mention that there are also quite a few 
aspiring students from the countries of the Near and Far East, 
who, during the school semester, attempt to register marriages 
with citizens of Latvia (also fictive marriages). I would like 
to know what sort of specialists this university is training, if 
even during the study period or immediately after completing 
studies, they are registering companies in the Republic of 
Latvia Business Registry with twenty or thirty dollars or so in 
their pockets to start business activities? It seems that no one 
at present can tell how many firms and limited liability 
companies are registered under the roof of this university, what 
they are involved with, and how this benefits our nation? 
  In my opinion, the site of this university could be used for 
the creation of the Academy for State Officials, as discussed by 
the Minister of Reform, and then there would be no need to evict 
the archives from 15 Rainis boulevard, which is involved with 
the gathering and examination of party and KGB documents. 
  And finally, if the administration does not adopt stronger 
entry regulations, if it doesn't adopt quotas for issuing 
permits for stay already now, then the uncontrollable entry will 
continue of foreigners who are hostile, do not know the 
language, and do not understand the culture and traditions, and 
who are writing to every organization in the world about human 
rights violations, further confusing the issues -- rights of 
citizens and human rights.

<F P=106> [Public opinion poll results: "RL [Republic of Latvia] </F>
Government Ratings, No. 9"] 
  [Text] Commentary 
  In examining the results of the periodic poll, we see that 
still there is no particular trend in public's opinion of the 
governmentis apparent. Comparing these results with those of the 
previous poll at the end of last year, the ratings of almost all 
members of the government have increased slightly. We will soon 
see whether this tendency shows durability. But this time let's 
look at that area which under current circumstances essentially 
influences both the public's opinion of the Cabinet of Ministers 
and the success of the government's actions: the intersection of 
foreign policy and domestic policy. 
  In the first two weeks of 1994 the most prominent event, Mr. 
Rucs's action, and its repercussions were already widely known 
and greatly discussed in the mass media, causing one to reflect 
on a few other, less examined situations. 
  First of all, Mr. Rucs's operation obviously will provoke 
certain background questions regarding resolution of the fate of 
the Skrunda radar base. That could be exploited both as linkage, 
and as the opposite, as a non-linkage argument in the expression 
of public opinion in Latvia. In which direction this argument is 
used will become apparent very soon in the government's 
orientation of the information flow. 
  Secondly, a foundation was laid for a new polarization in 
public opinion, which might possibly be maintained until the 
local elections. Whether its heirs will be "an understanding, 
moderate orientation" or "the active radical forces" is still 
hard to predict. Much will depend on future propaganda 
campaigns, of course, and also on political activists in Russia. 
  Thirdly, the government must react to the shortcomings made 
obvious by the activities of the state's administrative 
mechanism, which were revealed in the events in the Vidzeme 
borough. Regardless of how we evaluate Mr. Rucs's actions, also 
knowing that in the world these sorts of incidents are not rare 
by any means, it is clear that even in a state with a 
deliberately decentralized administrative structure, development 
of such a situation is viewed as abnormal, both in the 
legislative and executive structure activities aspects. 
  Fourthly, our country is threatened by routinization of 
behavior inherited from the previous government, the 
unsatisfactory tendency--a sufficiently significant process of 
evaluation to concentrate attention on the actions of 
individuals. And therefore the most essential is the question, 
which has often been heard already, whether this noisy action 
has hidden causes and, if so, then what? But are those who are 
able to answer this question able and willing to do so? 
  The [Parex] expert group would be very thankful to 
NEATKARIGA 
CINA readers for their critical suggestions and proposals. Our 
phone numbers are Riga 331663 and 334162.

<F P=106> [Speech by President of the Russian Academy of Medical </F>
Sciences V.I. Pokrovskiy at the Second (LXV) Session of the 
General Meeting of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, 
26-30 January 1993: ``The Report of President of the Russian 
Academy of Medical Sciences V.I. Pokrovskiy''] 
  [Text] The scientific portion of this session is devoted to 
the neurosciences.[.sup]1[/] This is connected with the fact 
that an increase of the number of people suffering from nervous 
and mental illnesses, the outcome of which in half of the cases 
is disability, is being noted throughout the world. 
  This is not only the loss of manpower resources, but also a 
loss of the intellectual potential of the nation, as well as one 
of the causes of serious social deformations. Diseases of the 
brain are usually accompanied by disturbances of thinking, 
behavior, and the emotional sphere, of which an increase of drug 
addiction, crime, and suicides is a direct consequence. 
  In Russia not less than 20 million people suffer from 
diseases that to one degree or another are connected with brain 
disorders. About 5 million people are chronically disabled owing 
to these illnesses. The maintenance of patients costs 
approximately 23 billion rubles [R] a year. 
  The scale of the total losses of society in connection with 
pathology of the nervous system is unprecedented. They are 
estimated, for example, in the United States alone at $401 
billion a year, which amounts to an economic value that is equal 
to 7.3 percent of the gross national product. Of course, the 
noneconomic harm is extremely great, but it is not liable to 
scientific determination. 
  It should also be considered that the process of the 
increase 
of the length of the biological life of man is not being 
accompanied, unfortunately, by the lengthening of the period of 
his labor activity. On the contrary, it is making him 
unprotected against nervous system diseases of old age and in 
need of the help of others. Nervous and mental disorders, 
particularly psychoemotional stress, are the favorite place of 
the application of the activity of charlatans of all 
colors--sorcerers, psychics, and miracle workers. This also 
merits the more active attention of specialists. 
  The World Health Organization and the leadership of a number 
of countries have made at the state level the decision on a 
10-year program on the study of the brain--``The Decade of the 
Brain, 1990-2000''. In the United States this program has 
acquired the status of a law, which has been passed by Congress 
with its annual financing in the amount of more than $350 
million a year. Similar decisions are being made in the 
countries of the European Community. 
  The development of the neurosciences in our country and in 
the world confirms the possibility of obtaining in a 
comparatively short time results that can actually change the 
negative situation in the country, which is due to the medical 
and socioeconomic consequences of brain diseases of man. In 
connection with this the problems of the neurosciences should be 
grouped with priority problems. 
  It should be recalled that earlier the AMS [Academy of 
Medical Sciences] also discussed repeatedly the problems of the 
central nervous system and the brain. In particular, the sixth 
session (1950), which was held jointly with the USSR Academy of 
Sciences, was devoted to the development of the teachings of 
I.P. Pavlov. At the seventh session (1952) the first results 
were supplied (the theme--all diseases are due to a cortical 
disorder). The ninth session (1955) was the physiological 
analysis of the problem of inhibition. The 24th session (1967) 
was devoted to questions of the disturbance of cerebral 
circulation. The 32d session (1972) discussed the problem ``The 
Physiology and Pathology of the Brain.'' 
  At this session, which encompasses a wide range of 
questions, 
we need to approve the scientific program ``The Human Brain.'' 
We hope that this will be the first academic program that is 
supported by state financing, on which there is preliminary 
agreement. 
  The Presidium of the RAMS [Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences] also made the decision to conclude the scientific part 
of the sessions henceforth not with decrees, but with the 
adoption of scientific programs, the financing of the themes and 
projects of which will be carried out on a competitive (grant) 
basis. 
  Experience has shown that the formulation of state programs 
with special-purpose budget financing and their implementation 
on the basis of an expert evaluation and competitive selection 
during the period of an acute financial shortage are the most 
advanced form of the planning, coordination, and support of the 
most promising scientific research and collectives of 
scientists. The programs make it possible to consolidate the 
efforts of researchers, to set up temporary collectives, to halt 
in good time the financing of unpromising ones and, on the 
contrary, to strengthen promising ones. 
  Goal program financing is a tool, by means of which the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences can accomplish its main 
task--to raise to a qualitatively new level basic and applied 
research in medicine, the results of which will make a 
substantial change in the notion of the processes of vital 
activity of the healthy and ill person or will cause the radical 
improvement of the methods of diagnosis and treatment. 
  Under present conditions medical science, just as the entire 
domestic health care system, is close to crisis. The 
preservation of the Academy of Medical Sciences, its structure, 
and the scientific potential is a great achievement. However, 
thus far there is no concept of state policy of the development 
of medical science in the country, since the judicial legal 
status of scientific research and other institutions and of the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences itself has not been 
determined. The phrase from the Edict of the President of the 
Russian Federation that the functions on the organization and 
coordination of medical science in the country have been 
assigned to the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, is well 
known. But by other Edicts similar functions have been assigned 
to other ministries and departments, and this phrase remains a 
phrase, since legal and financial ties of the scientific 
councils of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences with higher 
educational institutions and scientific research institutions of 
the Ministry of Health and the State Committee of Sanitary 
Epidemiological Supervision of the Russian Federation and of 
other departmental affiliation are lacking. Owing to this the 
indicated institutions do not submit to the scientific councils 
and problem commissions plans and reports of scientific research 
work. Each department is introducing its own planning and 
reporting cards, which often are incompatible with each other. 
  Now 62 state programs, which concern the protection of the 
health of the population and medical science and were submitted 
by 12 ministries and departments, are now under consideration 
for financing in the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation. 
The Ministry of Health of Russia has drawn up another 38 
sectorial programs, moreover, all the programs are financed from 
the state budget, bypassing the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences. There are also various foundations. In the formed 
situation it is obvious that the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences is unable to perform the functions assigned to it by 
the President of Russia on the planning and coordination of 
medical science in the country, to conduct a qualified 
examination of scientific research projects, and to plan the 
further development of health care. 
  Taking what has been said into account, since August 1992 a 
commission, which was set up by the Presidium of the Russian 
Academy of Medical Sciences, under the chairmanship of 
Academician of the RAMS V.D. Fedorov has been working on the 
preparation of the Law on the development of medical science and 
the place of our academy. The commission has been working 
together with the Committee for Health of the Supreme Soviet of 
the Russian Federation and at present has prepared documents for 
the holding of parliamentary readings, which will take place in 
February 1993. 
  The necessity of the Law is determined by a number of 
circumstances, among which the most important one is the 
determination of the place of the academy and its institutions 
in the system of the distribution of the forms of property 
(state, municipal, and private) in accordance with the Law on 
Property, which was passed after the Edict of the President of 4 
January 1992 on the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. 
  In the Law the landed ownership of other types of property 
should also been attached to the academy and its institutions, 
since the lack of the same considerably complicates the activity 
of scientific collectives. 
  Further, it is necessary to legalize what was incorporated 
in 
the decree of the Government of July 1992 and, unfortunately, 
has thus far not been fulfilled--the determination of the level 
of financing of the academy and the social support of scientific 
associates of the academy and the assignment to the academy of 
the expert evaluation of scientific plans and the distribution 
of assets through grants. 
  In spite of the existing difficulties, scientists of Russia 
continued to conduct scientific research intensively. 
  Among the achievements of world level are the isolation of 
clones of hybridoma cells, which secrete monoclonal antibodies 
to the antigens of B cells of the pancreas, and the development 
of methods of the early diagnosis of insulin-dependent diabetes. 
Various immunomodulators were developed and were partially 
introduced in practice. Sparing methods of the treatment of 
intricate disturbances of the heart rhythm, techniques of 
transluminal angioplasty, and methods of the combined therapy of 
lymphogranulomatosis, which ensure a five-year survival rate of 
70-92 percent, were developed. New neurotropic and psychotropic 
drugs, heart remedies, and others were developed, tested, and 
introduced in practice. 
  Original X-ray endovascular methods of the replacement of 
blood vessels, sclera-strengthening methods for the prevention 
of the progression of myopias, and equipment and instruments for 
microsurgical operations, traumatology, and orthopedics, which 
have received world recognition, were developed. The Urat-2 
device for the intrarenal crushing of stones was developed. 
  Scientists of the Siberian Department developed methods of 
monitoring the health of the population and the environment and 
conducted depth epidemiological studies of the most prevalent 
noninfectious diseases. This made it possible to carry out the 
medical demographic, public health, and ecological mapping of a 
number of territories of Siberia and the Far East. 
  A collection of molecular probes of synthetic 
oligonucleotides, which is making it possible to study the 
structure of human DNA, were created. 
  The universal phenomenon of regenerator-plastic 
insufficiency 
and the decrease of metabolism was established, which makes it 
possible to reveal one of the mechanisms of the adaptation of 
the body under present adverse ecological conditions and creates 
the foundation for the development of fundamentally new 
approaches to prevention and therapy. New drugs were obtained 
from local resources. 
  It is possible to continue this list. But now is not the 
time 
to talk about successes. It is more important to find means of 
escaping a number of extremely negative trends that have 
occurred. 
  The main one of them is the decreasing amount of financing. 
  At the end of 1992 the amount of financing of scientific 
research of the academy came to R1.7 billion. As compared with 
1991 financing has increased by 8.7-fold, moreover, 24.3 percent 
of these assets (R428 million) were transferred to the academy 
only on 25 December 1992. The amount of financing of clinics 
came to R3,001,000,000. Allocations for the acquisition of 
equipment and the capital repair of the buildings of clinics 
were envisaged in the indicated sum, but 27 percent of the 
year's assets were also transferred to the academy after 20 
December. 
  How was it possible in a week to spend these assets 
purposefully? 
  And as a whole the increase of the amount of financing by 
the 
sections ``Science'' and ``Clinic'' does not offset the level of 
material expenditures of municipal services, which has increased 
by 15- to 30-fold, and at clinics the level of the cost of 
foodstuffs and medicines, which has increased by 50- to 100-fold. 
  Institutions and organizations have cut sharply the purchase 
of equipment and current outlays on scientific work and are not 
buying laboratory animals from nurseries, which has led 
nurseries to the decrease of production volumes, as a result of 
which their financial position is in a critical state. 
  The buildings of institutes are falling to the ground, since 
there are no assets for the performance of capital repair, for 
preparation for operation under winter conditions, and for their 
maintenance in proper condition. 
  An extremely serious situation has formed at the clinics of 
scientific research institutions. 
  The financial difficulties are being accompanied by the lack 
of the necessary drugs, instruments, equipment, and so on. A 
significant amount of imported equipment is idle, since there 
are no spare parts for it and no reagents. Freely convertible 
currency has not been allotted to the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences for two years. 
  On 15 January 1993 there were no control figures with 
respect 
to the budget for 1993 at the academy. It is unknown whether 
funds will be allocated for the introduction as of 1 December 
1992 of new salaries in accordance with the unified wage scale. 
  Financing for January has been opened in the amount of 
one-third of the credits of the fourth quarter of 1992. 
  It is natural that the financial crisis is adversely 
affecting the state of medical science. The attempts at the 
commercialization of medical science and the conversion of 
scientific research institutions to full self-support and 
self-financing are intensifying. The mass departure of 
scientific associates, moreover, the best trained ones, for work 
abroad under long-term contracts is being noted. Here a third of 
the scientific institutions of the RAMS have completely rejected 
international cooperation, the others have drastically 
restricted its volume. 
  The reason consists in the lack of assets for the 
fulfillment 
of the obligations of the Russian side within the framework of 
the signed agreements, and first of all with respect to the 
receiving of foreign specialists and the sending abroad of 
scientists of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences. 
  Attempts to establish parallel structures or structures that 
replace the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences (State 
Scientific Centers, which are directly subordinate to the 
Ministry of Science, the Higher School, and Technical Policy of 
the Russian Federation, the National Institute of Health, and so 
forth), having taken away the rights and functions of the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, are being observed all the 
time. Is it worthwhile, perhaps, to hear alternative proposals 
at the General Meeting of the academy, especially as they are 
being put forward or are supported by individual members of the 
Russian Academy of Medical Sciences? 
  Of course, the activity of the Russian Academy of Medical 
Sciences and its presidium deserves criticism. It is reacting 
slowly to the changed political and economic situation in the 
country. 
  We have not formulated a scientifically substantiated 
concept 
of the protection of the health of the population and the 
development of health care under the new economic conditions. We 
have not achieved, in spite of intensified work, the fulfillment 
of the Edict of the President of the Russian Federation and the 
decree of the Government, which concern medical science. We are 
carrying out slowly, although in a number of cases this has 
proved to be a positive factor, the reorganization of the 
activity of the academy itself. 
  However, it has been possible to do something. Today the 
session is settling the question of the establishment of the 
Northwestern Department of the RAMS, the structure of which will 
be absolutely new for the academy. Higher educational 
institutions and scientific research institutions, which are not 
included at the administrative level among the institutions of 
the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and are not financed by 
it, will be a part of the department on a functional basis. 
Given the break of vertical ties in the country and the 
strengthening of the economic independence of administrative 
territories the regional principle of the activity of the 
academy is acquiring particular interest, although many 
organizational and economic questions thus far remain unclear 
and inadequately studied. 
  The question of establishing the Volga River Center is being 
raised. 
  The Kursk Medical Institute in the person of its 
rector--Prof. A.V. Zavyalov--advanced the interesting initiative 
of establishing a Central Chernozem cost accounting affiliate of 
the RAMS. 
  Two institutes, which have a large turnover and are 
operating 
entirely on a cost accounting basis, became a part of the 
academy. 
  The Medical Literature Association, of which the Meditsina 
Publishing House, the Meditsinskaya entsiklopediya Scientific 
Production Association, and the publishing division of the 
Moscow Medical Academy imeni Sechenov became a part, was formed. 
There are grounds to hope that the systematic publication of 
medical journals will be resumed. Manuals and textbooks have 
again begun to appear. Work has started on the fourth edition of 
Bolshaya meditsinskaya entsiklopediya (The Great Medical 
Encyclopedia). 
  Several changes of the structure have also been carried out 
in the staff of the Presidium of the academy. A legal division, 
an economic administration, and a consular group in the 
Administration of Foreign Relations have been established. The 
structure in the administration of affairs has been streamlined, 
and several other things. 
  The level of medical science is the level of health care, 
this is the future health of the people. Today the academy is 
experiencing not the best of times, but nevertheless it is 
developing. 
  The academy in essence is beginning a new cycle of its 
development and activity. And our task is not only to preserve 
the scientific potential of medical science of the country, but 
also to enrich the traditions of domestic medicine, which is 
strong first of all in its scientific schools. And if step by 
step we achieve successes, this will help make the future of 
Russia brighter than it appears today.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksander Prochorov, Director of the Institute </F>
of General Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences: ``The 
Plight of Science''; first paragraph DELOVIE LYUDI comment] 
  [Text] The Nobel Prize winner and one of the creators of 
the laser, Alexander Prochorov, claims that Russia is joining 
the ranks of the third-grade science power and unless the 
government's attitude to science does not alter, the process 
will be irreversible. 
  The golden years of Russian science were the end of the 
1940's and the beginning of the 1950's. Salaries, provisions and 
equipment were all of the very best quality. In retrospect, this 
had its good and bad aspects, but the fact remains that 
scientists were well looked after. The results were positive: 
for years the world has been using a particle accelerator which 
was designed and made by Soviet scientists during those glorious 
years. It was at that time too that work began on developing the 
laser principle of producing high-intensity radiation, for which 
the author of this article, together with Nikolai Basov and the 
American Charles H. Townes, was awarded the Nobel Prize for 
physics. In those years research began into space and astounding 
progress was made. The list of examples goes on. Western 
scientists who are aware of the collapse of Russian science are 
tempted to ask, ``How is it then that the Soviet Union managed 
to break ahead?'' American colleagues remark how the successes 
of the USSR influenced the policies of the U.S. Congress and 
administration on basic science and scientists in that country. 
  In Russia, the situation has deteriorated, a process which 
began under Nikita Khrushchev. The policy of ``uniting science 
and practice'' was carried out ruthlessly. Whole institutes 
which carried out academic research were handed over to 
industry, including the Institute of Computing and Mathematics, 
the Institute of Oceanology and others. Fundamental research was 
placed on the back burner. The result in a number of important 
branches of science was lamentable. Specialists attracted by the 
``introduction into industry'' abandoned a number of ideas in 
the field of microelectronics. No attention was paid to the idea 
of ultra-pure materials or to high-quality diagnostic equipment. 
As a result, the computer Pamyat, which was way behind those 
being made abroad, was developed. Now, Russia is so 
``successful'' that her scientists wonder whether they will ever 
catch up with the Americans and the Japanese. 
  It is true that even in bad times there have been people in 
government who have well understood the importance of basic 
science. Many significant developments were made under the 
patronage of the military, but secrecy problems arose. As a 
scientist, it was clear to me that without exchanging 
information it would be impossible for science to move forward. 
I managed to stop many feeble attempts to make research work at 
the Institute of General Physics secret. It is curious to 
remember the complaint of one Russian who bemoaned the fact that 
he, who had the power to classify any of a scientist's projects 
as "top secret" and forbid him to travel abroad, was unable to 
classify his thoughts. 
<H5>  CATCH 22 </H5>
  The deterioration which is taking place in Russian science 
has already caused the country to be relegated to the third 
world, and in five years this process will be irreversible. 
Within the Academy of Sciences, a fall in scientific and labour 
discipline has become commonplace, as has the desertion of 
scientists for other spheres and the attempt to move abroad at 
all costs. The Presidium of the Academy has increased the 
salaries of scientists, but mostly this remains true only on 
paper, as the government cannot fund it. A stratum of 
self-styled ``pensioners'' has already formed amongst 
scientists. These scientists appear at their institutes mainly 
on the days when their allowances are paid (they cannot be 
called salaries), while in the rest of their time these 
candidates and doctors of science earn extra money by building 
dachas for businessmen, quietly growing crops on 
their plots of land, or turning to business. Of course, a number 
of institutes, including the Institute of General Physics, 
retain their former glory: the group of those devoted to science 
remains intact; foreigners come, offering contracts and joint 
projects. However, the West sees Russian scientists as cheap 
labour. Leading Russian scientists are being offered salaries on 
a par with those in Malaysia or Mexico. Proposals have been made 
to buy out laboratories or even whole institutes and, naturally, 
to dictate the research programme. 
  Russian science has been forced to sell its most important 
files, expensive equipment and materials, and designs which are 
the last word in scientific thought and which any other country 
would not sell at any price. In saying this, I do not wish to 
give the impression that I am against partnership or cooperation 
with foreign scientists. I myself was born in Australia, and 
have lived abroad and enjoyed the hospitality of foreign 
scientists. The Institute of General Physics is working on a 
number of joint projects, including with the U.S., South Korea 
and France. Yet the sale of scientific developments and 
strategic supplies in the hope of saving what little remains 
signals the beginning of a collapse. 
  However, even these necessary sales cost the Institute 
dearly. It is told, ``You earn hard currency, therefore you must 
be a commercial organization, and references to your research do 
not give you the right to request a discount on electricity, 
water or materials,'' which are needed in great quantities for 
carrying out the work. Incidentally, references to our research, 
or to the need to keep up scientific funding are not even heeded 
at government level. Several appeals on the part of scientists, 
including the president of the Academy of Sciences, to both the 
Gaidar and the Chernomyrdin governments, had no success. The 
matter is usually dealt with by petty clerks who take care to 
remind representatives of institutes that there are many mouths 
to feed. 
  Although the current powers include, as never before, many 
people with scientific degrees--there are even correspondent 
members and academicians--such an attitude reflects the lack of 
understanding regarding the scope of basic science which, given 
the chance, could make breakthroughs in high technology. Even in 
former times, advanced, promising ideas were not always taken on 
board. At the time when laser technology was being developed, a 
director of industry had to be invited to the Institute to 
attend seminars describing the future for laser technology. At 
least then scientists were trusted, but now the lack of 
understanding is deepening, as is the economic crisis. 
<H5>  RICH MAN, POOR MAN </H5>
  In this situation, all that remains to do is to fold one's 
arms and wish success to those who find a work placement abroad 
and sign a long-term contract. What else can one do, if the 
average salary at a scientific institute is 25,000 rubles (25 
dollars at the beginning of September). How can these people and 
their families survive in comparison, newspapers advertise jobs 
for painters with a salary of R150,000. Comments to the effect 
that science must be reorganized and freed from its excess 
weight are disturbing. What is needed is a normal level of 
financing, the provision of equipment and materials, and of 
course, control over the results. 
  The fact that Russian science is lagging behind is growing 
more noticeable by the day, and, what is more, the advance of 
scientific knowledge in the rest of the world is accelerating. 
It is cause for concern that Russian scientists have nothing to 
report to world conferences on technology. Russia might once 
again miss the boat, for instance in nanotechnology, where 
scientists are working on the level of atomic structures. A new 
era of laser technology is about to begin, and here Russia is 
behind: there is no money available to finance this work, and 
nothing, as is known, will come of nothing. One cannot even 
order foreign science magazines--there is no hard currency. At 
the Institute of General Physics work has been stopped on 
crystal growth. The effect this will have on microelectronics is 
clear: all materials will have to be imported. Indeed, even 
Russia's own manufacturers are driving her towards this. For 
example, zirconium oxide, which is used in the manufacture of 
fianite currently costs so much that it is cheaper to buy it 
abroad. Yet due to the shortage of hard currency, work in this 
field will also have to cease. Financing in the field of 
fiber-optic communications, laser physics, solid-state physics 
and optics, where Russian institutes have high-class designs 
attracting the interest of foreign countries, is nowhere near 
sufficient. Thanks to a number of contracts with foreign firms, 
some of them are still managing to get by. 
  If developments are not made in the field of fiber-optic 
technology, the country as a whole will be unable to make any 
progress. People wrongly believe that cellular communications 
are an alternative, but one of the disadvantages of such systems 
is the ease with which conversations can be overheard. With 
fiber-optic systems, however, it is impossible to listen in on 
conversations: i.e., not only military, but any commercial 
secrets will be better protected. I believe that Russia has all 
that is necessary to create a fiber-optic network herself. 
  Russia is a country rich in talent and ideas, but most of 
all 
it must be hoped that she does not destruct science herself. It 
can be saved today, but tomorrow will be too late.

Botanical Garden of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and 
Botanical Garden of Moscow State University imeni M. V. 
Lomonosov, Moscow: ``Soros Foundation Grants for the Problem of 
`Biological Diversity'''; UDC 58:061.21:06.026.53] 
  [Text] The funding of research through a system of grants 
offered on a competitive basis by different foundations is a 
common practice in the West. At the present time, this form of 
funding is also coming to our country but, unfortunately, this 
is happening in the presence of progressive "cuts" in State 
allocations. Thus far, George Soros, the well-known American 
financier and public figure, originally from Hungary, has made 
some real steps to support Russian science. Recently, the 
endeavors of Soros have been aired extensively in the Russian 
press. 
  One of the first Soros project in Russia and other CIS 
states 
was to provide a rather considerable sum to support research on 
biological diversity. Announcements of the competition for 
grants, which was established by the International Cultural 
Initiative Foundation and Russian Federation Academy of Natural 
Sciences [RANS], appeared in the press in June and July 1992. N. 
N. Vorontsov, RANS vice-president, was the initiator. 
  The competition was announced for the following directions 
of 
the Biodiversity problem: 
  1) systematics of plants (including fungi and 
microorganisms) 
and preservation of their biodiversity; 
  2) systematics of animals and preservation of their 
biodiversity; 
  3) paleosystematics and evolution of biodiversity; 
  4) genetic methods of studying and preserving biodiversity; 
  5) methods of preserving collections on biodiversity; the 
museum and collection business; 
  6) study and preservation of biodiversity in sanctuaries. 
  G. Soros allocated slightly less than a million dollars to 
the competition, planning to distribute this sum among close to 
4,000 grantees in republics of the former USSR (with the 
exception of the Baltic states, Ukraine and Moldova, where there 
are branches of the Soros Foundation). 
  It is known that something similar to grants has appeared in 
recent times in our research institutions as a sort of 
supplement to basic funding, but retention of dominance of 
administrative-feudal relations leads, not infrequently, to even 
greater flaws in distribution of funds that with the direct 
payment system. To avoid this, the Cultural Initiative 
Foundation selected the form of individual applications to 
participate in the competition without passing through any 
administrative entities. Two expert commissions, for Moscow and 
St. Petersburg, were created to hold the contest. The Moscow 
commission, headed by N. N. Vorontsov, consists of botanists V. 
A. Krasilov, M. G. Pimenov, A. K. Skvortsov, and V. N. 
Tikhomirov; the St. Petersburg commission, headed by Yu. I. 
Polyanskiy, comprises botanists M. A. Bondartseva, D. V. 
Geltman, N. S. Golubkova, S. G. Zhilin, R. V. Kamelin, N. N. 
Tsvelev, and B. A. Yurtsev. The expert commissions considered 
the following factors: consistency of topic in the submitted 
application and personal experience of the applicant with the 
orientation of the competition, potential benefit of announced 
research and, when screening applications according to Item 5, 
importance and general availability of the preserved 
collections. The Moscow applicants were examined by the St. 
Petersburg commission and the restby the Moscow commission, and 
each application was examined by at least three experts. 
  A total of 2,252 applications were received, and 2,110 
passed 
the competition. Most of the accepted applications came from 
Russia (1,885), 72 were from Armenia, 34 from Kazakhstan, 27 
from Belorussia, 26 from Georgia, 18 from Kyrgyzia, 13 from 
Turkmenia, 11 each from Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan, and 9 from 
Tajikistan. Botanical applications constituted about one-fourth 
of the total number (537 + 137 applications, which could be 
considered botanical), and there was approximately the same 
share among those accepted with regard to distribution in 
different states. Most of the applications submitted by 
botanists were received from the Botanical Institute imeni 
Komarov, RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] (186), Moscow State 
University] (47), State Botanical Garden RAN (26), Institute of 
Plant Growing imeni N. I. Vavilov (12) and from other cities 
(Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, Vladivostok, Minsk, Alma-Ata, Penza, 
Tver, Ashkhabad, and others). The grants (each for $250) were 
paid out in a lump sum (once); payments began in March 1993. 
  In compiling this information, we used data kindly provided 
by A. P. Rasnitsyn, who performed the duties of commission 
chairman during a temporary absence of N. N. Vorontsov.

<F P=106> [Article ``Chemical weapons or chemical war?'' by V. </F>
Voronov, L. Fedorov under the rubric ``Current Topics''] 
  [Text] Two significant events occurred in the world of 
chemical disarmament in the second decade of January 1993. On 13 
January in Paris, Russia signed the Convention on banning the 
development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical 
weapons and its destruction and together with her, more than 100 
other countries affixed their signatures. At a joint meeting of 
the Committee on Industry and Power and the Committee on 
Environment and Natural Resources at the Russian Federation 
Supreme Council in Moscow on 19 January, the committees rejected 
the very concept of the comprehensive program of stage-by-stage 
destruction of chemical weapons in Russia submitted by the 
Convention Committee on Chemical and Biological Weapons. Almost 
no one objects to the fact that chemical weapons must be 
destroyed. Yet such a seemingly noble 
cause--disarmament--engenders numerous problems which are not 
only economic but also environmental, social, and political in 
nature. In itself, parting with chemical weapons does not 
signify an end to chemical war but merely its transition to a 
new--environmental--phase. The experience of our civilization 
reveals that it is not easy to untangle the knot of 
contradictions without a detailed study of history. 
Consequently, we asked two professionals in their respective 
fields, the historian Vladimir Voronov who recently completed 
graduate studies at Russia's Humanities Academy and Doctor of 
Chemical Sciences Lev Fedorov to talk about the development of 
chemical weapons production in our country. The facts which they 
are presenting here are drawn from declassified archives, 
official statements, and private conversations with people in 
the know. This is how the conversation turned out. 
  Chemist. From the chemical viewpoint, the most 
``prolific'' part of our chemical weapons in the last 70 years 
can be divided into four categories--yperites [mustard gases], 
choking chemical warfare (OV) agents (phosgene and diphosgene), 
arsenic-containing chemical warfare agents (lewisite, adamsite, 
and diphenylchlorarsine), and finally, highly toxic 
phosphorus-containing nerve agents (sarin, soman, and V-gas). 
Production of the first three groups falls within the period 
from the 1920s to the late 1950s. The last category is the 
``accomplishment'' of the 1960s-1980s. In particular, mustard 
gases formed the bulk of our chemical arsenal up to the 1950s 
while everything began back in the 1920s. 
  Mustard Gases 
  Historian. The first mustard gas batch was 
produced in Moscow by the Olginskiy plant which was nominally 
listed as experimental production of the Anilintrest. This 
happened between 30 Aug and 3 Sep 24. Eighteen pounds of the 
products were produced. It is interesting to note the way this 
formulation was described in those years: production of one 
pound of the substance "H" called for 2,006 buckets of 95% 
alcohol, 0.9 pounds of technical sulfur chloride, and 10 pounds 
of commercial sulfuric acid. 
  Chemist. Substance ``H'' is the code name of 
technical mustard gas which can be produced by the simplest 
technology through ethylene. It usually contains a lot of 
impurities--from 20 to 50% (distilled mustard gas is 
referred 
to as HD). Cloaked in this manner of clothing, mustard gas can 
be traced through all of our prior documents. Yet in the 
chemical language, this formulation appears rather prosaic: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-07A>           Figure </FIG>




  Our military was experimenting with special enthusiasm with 
low freezing and viscous formulations. 
  Historian. By the way, our military learned to use 
mustard gas in 1927-1933 under the leadership of German military 
chemists. This enabled the teachers to conceal their work with 
chemical warfare agents banned under the Treaty of Versailles in 
the USSR. The first serious German-Soviet mustard gas tests were 
conducted at the edge of today's central chemical warfare 
testing range in Shikhany (Saratov oblast). The first attempt to 
set up production of mustard gas in the town of Ivashchenkovo 
(subsequently Trotsk which is now called Chapayevsk in Samara 
oblast) in 1923-1926 also involved the Germans. Yet it was 
unsuccessful, so large-scale technical mustard gas production 
began only in the 1930s in Chepayevsk at the Bersol plant (now 
the chemical fertilizer plant). Generally speaking, mustard gas 
was produced at two new chemical construction projects--the 
giants of the first five-year plan. In 1929--at the Berezniki 
Chemical Works (soda plant in Perm oblast), the other giant is 
the chemical works in Bobriki (subsequently Stalinogorsk in 
Moscow oblast and today--Novomoskovsk in Tula oblast). Its 
design mustard gas capacity is 9,000 t/yr. Here we should add 
production of viscous yperite with a capacity of 6,000 t. Other 
yperite producers at the turn of the 1920s and 1930s which can 
be mentioned include the Bogorodskiy and Ugreshskiy plants (both 
in Moscow) as well as others. By 1935, the production capacity 
of our mustard gas facilities reached 35,000 t. This was without 
the Chapayevsk plant and high-volume production of 
ethylene-propylene low-freezing mustard gas according to V.S. 
Zaykov's technology set up just before the war at Kaprolaktam 
(Dzerzhinsk) which, it seems, lasted longer than the rest. 
  Choking Agents 
  Chemist. In closing the ``mustard gas'' page in 
our history, we must add that during the war, attempts to 
produce mustard gas in Russia alone were made at 30 plants, 
including plants in Omsk and Tomsk where mustard gas facilities 
were constructed with U.S. assistance. Yet technical yperite "H" 
is a relatively simple product while some of our plants had a 
rather broad chemical warfare orientation. For example, the 
Chapayevsk and Novomoskovsk plants also produced choking 
agents--phosgene and diphosgene--in addition to mustard gas: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-08A></FIG>




              Yet only trace amounts of arsenic trichloride and 
_g_-lewisite are contained in the mixture while the 
_b_-lewisite 
concentration may reach 10%. Thus, the combat origin of 
lewisite is formed by _a_-lewisite which develops during the 
synthesis in the form of two isomers: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-08C></FIG>




              The most toxic trans-isomer is predominant in the mixture. 
  Historian. The history of lewisite in the USSR was 
thornier than that of other chemical warfare agents. In 1935, 
the Army announced an annual need for 1,000 t of lewisite but 
did not receive a single ton from the industry. The need to 
obtain lewisite was repeatedly reflected in government decrees. 
In 1937, the chief of the Chemical Warfare Directorate of the 
workers' and peasants' Red Army complained in a memorandum to I. 
Stalin and V. Molotov that the Berezniki Chemical Works still 
had not set up planned lewisite production. 
  Chemist. The reason isquite simple--there was no 
calcium carbide without which cheap acetylene cannot be produced: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-09A></FIG>




              In Central Russia, calcium carbide production was set up 
just 
before the war at the Chernaya Rechka plant (Dzerzhinsk). This 
was what gave an impetus to lewisite production at the 
Kaprolaktam (Dzerzhinsk) and in Chapayevsk. By the way, a third 
kiln was added in 1943 to the two operating furnaces. 
Altogether, attempts were made to engage at least 13 plants in 
lewisite production in Russia alone. 
  Now we are left with the task of figuring out how to destroy 
today's lewisite stockpiles without any detriment to our planet 
(6.4 thousand t in the town of Kambarka in Udmurtia and 0.2 
thousand t in the village of Gornyy, Saratov oblast). Moreover, 
a lot of munitions with our lewisite stockpiles were sunk some 
time ago in the Arctic Ocean and buried in the ground at various 
locations in Russia. 
  Historian. The Soviet Army was actively preparing 
to employ three other arsenic-containing substances in the last 
war--adamsite, diphenylchlorarsine, and diphenylcyanarsine. 
Adamsite production was set up at the Kineshma chemical plant 
imeni M.V. Frunze (Ivanovo oblast; it is listed as the adamsite 
plant in the documents). In 1935, the plant capacity reached 
3,000 t/yr, and in 1937, plans to increase it to 10-12,000 t 
with a prospect of raising it further to 17,000 t were reported 
to I. Stalin. Diphenylchlorarsine production was related to the 
operation of the Derbenevsk (Moscow) and Shchelkovo (Moscow 
oblast) plants. From the production viewpoint, production of 
these chemical warfare agents was probably not very complicated. 
  Chemist. What's true is true. The feedstocks for 
producing both items cannot be classified as especially scarce 
(we shall cite one of the synthesis versions): 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-09B></FIG>




              And the approach to producing these substances was also on a 
large scale: in Russia alone, nine plants were producing 
adamsite during the war and at least eight--diphenylchlorarsine 
and diphenylcyanarsine. 
  We should note that the attitude toward arsenic-containing 
chemical warfare agents has undergone a certain evolution. 
Whereas they have been regarded as irritant agents before, today 
these substances are no longer treated as chemical weapons, and 
they are not even mentioned in the Chemical Disarmament 
Convention. Yet arsenic-containing compounds remained an 
environmental weapon or a weapon against ourselves. 
  Historian. This aspect of the problem became 
evident quite a long time ago. Back in 1937, it was reported to 
I. Stalin that there was no satisfactory solution to the problem 
of waste-water treatment in arsenic-containing chemical warfare 
agent production. The issue of discharges was not given high 
priority by the authorities either then or later on. As for the 
fate of chemical munitions, the decision taken by the military 
was surprisingly simple. In one highly classified earlier 
document dated 1989, we read then between 1946 and 1978, 17,543 
aerial bombs with adamsite warheads were sunk by our naval 
forces at two locations in the Baltic Sea. 
  Chemist. I should note, by the way, that today 
much is being said about sinking the captured German munitions. 
This is not so. Most of the munitions were ours. As a matter of 
fact, there were not two but at least ten sinking locations. 
  From the viewpoint of environmental safety, the formulated 
problem is exceptionally urgent. Suffice it to say that the 
Convention signed on 13 January bans such methods of parting 
with chemical weapons as "sinking at any reservoirs, burial in 
the ground, or combustion in the open air." This is why the 
draft program for destroying our chemical weapons was rejected 
on 19 January. It absolutely failed to take into account the 
fact that we had to free ourselves not only from available 
chemical weapons but from much of what had been done many years 
earlier. We are talking about the ecological impact of the 
actions undertaken by our military and related to the 
wide-ranging and thoughtless sinking, burial, and burning of 
hundreds of thousands of tons of old chemical weapons as well as 
the activity of our industry involved in producing these weapons. 
  Phosphorus-Containing Chemical Warfare Agents 
  These 1989 documents provide food for very serious thought. 
For example, one of the documents from the Politburo of the 
Central Committee of the CPSU referring to foreign press reports 
mentions the possible transfer of production technologies of 
some of our chemical warfare agents to Middle Eastern countries. 
Most likely, the agent mentioned is sarin. This is a highly 
toxic phosphorus-containing nerve agent which, as well as soman, 
was produced at the Khimprom Production Association in Volgograd: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-10A></FIG>




              Today, these phosphorus-containing chemical warfare agents 
are stored, according to official reports, at five arsenals 
scattered throughout Russia--in Kizner (Udmurtia), Leonidovka 
(Penza oblast), Maradykovskoye (Kirovsk oblast), Pochepa 
(Bryansk oblast), and Shchuchye (Kurgan oblast). The issue of 
the methods to destroy chemical warfare agents remains 
absolutely unclear. In any case, it will be a long time before 
these of our "treasures" belong to the domain of history. 
  Historian. The problem of binary chemical weapons, 
primarily phosphorus-containing chemical warfare agents, has 
been actively discussed in foreign press in the last decades. 
Yet even we have not remained on the sidelines. I can recall 
that back in the fall of 1989, our Foreign Minister E. 
Shevardnadze proposed at a session of the UN General Assembly 
that the Americans give up the development of binary chemical 
warfare systems on a parity basis. 
  Chemist. Yes, the development of binary weapons 
and even multicomponent weapons is a complicated technological 
breakthrough and a serious new step in the race toward chemical 
death. The source components (precursors) have a low toxicity 
and are convenient to store, while the synthesis location of the 
highly toxic chemical warfare agent from these components is 
transferred from the reactor at an industrial site directly to 
the munitions. The moment of synthesis occurs during the flight 
toward the probable enemy. Strictly speaking, there can be many 
such binary pairs. For example, the following can be used for 
our V-gas: 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-10C></FIG>



              Yet the issue of binary weapons and phosphorus-containing 
chemical warfare agents in general is a subject for a separate 
conversation; likewise, the issue of environmentally safe 
destruction of chemical warfare agents and environmental cleanup 
of Russia's contaminated territories should be discussed 
separately.

Metallurgist Union] 
  [Text] On 24 July 92, the Russian Federation Ministry of 
Justice registered the charter of the International Metallurgist 
Union, and this date became the official birthday of the new 
public association. During several months preceding this event, 
the group of sponsors and the coordination council made a great 
effort in learning the metallurgists' opinions about the 
expediency of merging into a union and its likely tasks, status, 
and functions. These efforts culminated in the founding congress 
held on March 27,1992 in Lipetsk which unanimously adopted the 
resolution to set up the union and discussed its charter and 
management bodies. 
  The adoption of this resolution was prompted by the actual 
situation characterized by the negative consequences of 
disrupted economic links and the breakup of a single 
metallurgical complex into components. The output volumes of the 
principal types of production throughout metallurgical 
enterprises of CIS countries in 1992 decreased by 17-24%. 
This 
drop in production continued in 1992 and in relation to 1991 at 
Russian Federation enterprises amounted to 12.5% for 
steel and 
15% for rolled products. The situation in ferrous 
metallurgy in 
Ukraine and Kazakhstan is no better. In nonferrous metallurgy in 
the former USSR republics, the drop in production in 1991 
amounted to 7.7% for primary aluminum and 30.6% 
for secondary 
aluminum, 24.4% for refined copper, 14.4% for 
nickel, 24.\1% 
for zinc, and 19% for rolled nonferrous metals. The 
unavoidable 
metal product price rise (by 26.5 times during the first nine 
months of 1992) proceeded in a jump-like fashion without 
correlation with production costs, which aggravates the gap 
between the financial position of the enterprises even further 
and forces many of them to limit wage increases, cut back 
production staff, and lose skilled personnel. 
  The long-range metallurgy development plans produced earlier 
with a balanced coordination among the subindustries and at a 
territorial level lost their real basis when the former union 
republics became sovereign. The metallurgists understand that it 
would be unreasonable simply to discard them and forget. A joint 
search for new nontraditional decisions is necessary. 
  The database support for the enterprises in the fields of 
production, science and engineering, and economic situation in 
the industry and at the enterprises is continuously shrinking, 
which is fraught with unpredictable consequences even for the 
most well-meaning initiatives of individual enterprises to 
expand their production. At any moment, they may find themselves 
without supplies of the necessary ferroalloys, billets, and 
refractory and other materials. 
  At the founding congress which gathered representatives from 
many enterprises, scientific research institutes, and 
metallurgical organizations from all regions and a number of CIS 
countries, an unambiguous admission was made that their 
separation is a serious obstacle on the road to overcoming the 
crisis and further developing the industry. We need a 
unification vehicle which would not repeat former command 
administrative links but would be consistent with today's 
principles of independent economic activity under the conditions 
of market relations. 
  The historical experience and today's foreign practices 
attest that such associations are possible and are already 
successfully functioning and justifying the hopes of their 
founders and members. 
  The Society of German Metallurgists founded in 1860 is one 
of 
the oldest in the world. According to its charter, its 
objectives are assisting in the technical, scientific-technical, 
and engineering efforts in the field of pig iron, steel, and 
associated material production. Using its own resources, this 
society is carrying out a broad spectrum of scientific and 
engineering research, ensures legal protection of their 
findings, assists young workers in increasing their skill 
levels, and carries out expert (arbitration) activity in its 
sphere. Because of its practical activities, the society has 
acquired a good reputation, its opinion is taken into account by 
the government in adopting resolutions pertaining to German 
metallurgy, and its influence in the structures of the European 
community is noticeable. 
  The rapid development of the industry, power generation, and 
mining in the second half of the 19th Century in Russia 
necessitated the development of societies with a professional 
orientation. Russian technical and physical-chemical societies 
were formed and several years later--the Russian Metallurgical 
Society and a number of others. Large regional associations of 
engineering and technical personnel sprang up. The societies did 
not limit themselves to educational and information 
dissemination activity but carried out extensive organizational 
work and defended the interests of the society members in 
various spheres. They took coordinated positions, e.g., in the 
issues of providing industrial credits and securing government 
orders for domestic enterprises, the development outlook of the 
iron ore and bituminous coal base in the new industrial regions 
of the country, involvement of foreign capital and protection 
from foreign competition, and improvement in the working 
conditions in the mining and metallurgical industry and the 
status of workers and their insurance. The activity of the 
Russian Metallurgical Society is directly related to the names 
of such prominent metallurgists as Chernov, Kurako, 
Grum-Grzhimaylo, and Pavlov who exerted significant influence on 
the development of the metallurgical production science and 
practices. 
  The authority of the newly developed International 
Metallurgist Union includes enterprises and organizations in the 
metallurgical industry in CIS countries; collective (enterprises 
and organization) and individual members from these as well as 
other foreign countries may join it. This is a public 
organization which unites on a voluntary basis engineers, 
scientists, experts, production managers, and social work 
organizers in the metallurgical and mining industries. In its 
activity, the union is guided by Russian Federation legislation 
and international legal standards and the legislation of the 
states which house union departments, as well as its own charter. 
  The union provides representation and protects the interests 
and rights of its members before the authorities and assists in 
effectively utilizing the most recent achievements of science 
and engineering in order to increase the ferrous and nonferrous 
metallurgy production quality and competitiveness. Union 
functions include drafting and submitting to government bodies 
proposals on issues of metallurgical and mining industry 
development strategy, international division of labor which is 
based on carrying out the necessary research, expert 
examinations, and assessments of domestic and world trends. 
Another important form of activity is supplying union members 
with scientific and engineering and other types of information, 
conducting exhibits, seminars, and symposia, and helping to 
improve business skills. 
  The principal governing bodies--the union council and 
auditing committee--were elected at the founding congress. 
  The Council of the International Metallurgist Union began 
its 
practical activity immediately after its election by the 
congress. In the initial phase, the sponsoring group consisting 
of the council members was forced to carry out extensive work on 
formalizing in an established order the charter documents and 
registering the charter at the Justice Ministry. For greater 
promptness, a council presidium consisting of 17 members and six 
standing committees were set up from among council members at 
the first meeting; the standing committees deal with the 
structural and economical reorganization; modernization 
development strategy and engineering progress; social problems; 
finance and economics; juridical and legal affairs; and 
relations with mass media. One more committee--on foreign 
economic relations--was recently set up. 
  The structure of the union and its regional organizations is 
still being formed while negotiations on cooperation with other 
public organizations, foreign representatives, and companies are 
underway. Relationships with the organizations which form the 
metal products market, i.e., trading houses, brokerage 
associations, and the Roskontrakt Russian contracting authority 
are being established. Proposals to set up specialized banks for 
servicing the market for metals and raw materials for their 
production are in a preparatory stage. 
  Today, we have reached the stage in the union operation 
where 
it is necessary to concentrate the intellectual potential of the 
scientists and experts on generating proposals to bring 
metallurgy from the critical condition and find ways and forms 
of their realization through management bodies. I would like to 
outline several problems on which the International Metallurgist 
Union (MSM) is currently working and which, in our opinion, are 
especially urgent. 
  The problem of shipments under intrabranch cooperation is 
very acute. For many decades, the metallurgical industry has 
developed under the conditions of rigid economic relations and 
has formed a single technological and economic complex. Many 
enterprises are rather narrowly specialized, so the exchange of 
metal products among the regions has been carried out on a scale 
measured in tens of millions of tons, most of which was made up 
by billets for subsequent conversion into rolled products, 
pipes, and hardware. Today, these cooperation links are 
disrupted. The emerging metals market does not yet have the 
necessary structures and attributes and does not create 
favorable conditions for trading relations. On the contrary, 
bereft of reasonable controls allowing for the objective factors 
through a differentiated taxation system, customs duties, and 
quotas, our market has opened up a broad avenue for large-scale 
export of conversion metal to noncontiguous foreign countries 
and made it unprofitable to ship it to enterprises inside Russia 
and to CIS countries. The International Metallurgist Union is 
promoting an initiative to correct this situation. We need a new 
approach which would ensure that the enterprises have incentives 
to ship billets to conversion plants first and foremost. 
  The first problem is directly related to the second--the 
metallurgical enterprises' incentive to improve the quality of 
end products and expand its production for shipment to the world 
market. Today, trading involves primarily metal with a low 
degree of readiness: pig iron, scrap metal, and blanks. Yet even 
quality types of production are often sold at prices 30% 
below 
those in the world market. One of the reason is the fact that 
this production lacks quality certificates issued by specialized 
companies, as is the case with foreign practices. 
  In recent years, work on developing certification centers in 
Russia was undertaken by the ``Sapem-sertifikat'' Joint Stock 
company, one of those founders is the International Metallurgist 
Union. In October 1992, Russia's State Standard Board gave 
``Sapem-sertifikat'' the authority and entrusted it with the 
functions of the central body of the certification system for a 
group of similar goods among which metal products play a 
prominent part. Cooperation in this field with known foreign 
companies has already begun. The union intends to expand these 
efforts in the framework of the functions stipulated by the 
charter aimed at improving the metal products export efficiency 
by adopting a number of governmental resolutions dealing with 
allocation of quotas, export, re-export and licensing rules, etc. 
  Supplying metallurgy with secondary raw material has always 
posed a complex problem here. Today, the situation became simply 
catastrophic. The enterprises and individual persons are no 
longer interested in turning in scrap metal while large 
quantities of scrap metal already procured are exported, 
primarily its most valuable and scarcest types. Scrap purchasing 
and processing enterprises were left without the resources 
necessary for reproducing fixed capital and guaranteeing current 
operations. A real danger has developed that secondary metal 
enterprises may pass to the hands of private persons who will 
increase scrap exports. Today, dramatic measures are necessary 
for effectively utilizing this very valuable type of raw 
material which, in essence, is a part of the national treasury. 
In our opinion, a special resolution must be made in this regard 
at a governmental or presidential level, and we are actively 
pursuing these goals. Special commissions have been set up for 
examining the situation and drafting proposals. 
  Metallurgy in CIS countries is in need of serious 
modernization. The strategy which was developed earlier for this 
purpose is largely unacceptable today due to a change in the 
role of the state, forms of property, and economic activity of 
enterprises. The International Metallurgist Union intends to 
discharge its state obligations of comprehensively assisting 
metallurgy modernization in Russia and other CIS countries. 
  Mindful of how stressed state budgets are, we think that it 
is possible to find new approaches to financing this metallurgy 
modernization by combining it with certain state support. We are 
talking about setting up an off-budget technological development 
and modernization fund whose draft proposal has been prepared 
and approved by the International Metallurgist Union council. 
  Our metallurgy has been developing largely on the basis of 
scientific developments from domestic scientific research 
institutes whose scientific output is highly regarded throughout 
the world. Due to the lack of state financial support, the 
metallurgical science has found itself today in an extremely 
difficult situation. We think that it is possible to extricate 
ourselves from it by setting up national scientific ferrous and 
nonferrous metallurgy centers on the basis of existing 
scientific research institutes. The International Metallurgist 
Union may take the initiative to develop large industry-wide 
metallurgy modernization programs with the participation of 
these centers. The off-budget R&amp;D fund may become the 
financial 
basis of these efforts; it is expedient to form this fund 
through withholdings from the cost of metallurgical production. 
  An industry-wide specialized commercial bank which would 
provide specific and beneficial credits for measures aimed at 
modernizing enterprises and developing capacities for 
manufacturing competitive products should be set up. Obviously, 
it is expedient to obtain long-term interest-free credits, e.g., 
from Russia's Central Bank or the government for shortening the 
initial period necessary to develop the financial basis for 
metallurgical modernization. 
  In discharging its function of legal protection for its 
members, the International Metallurgist Union will also continue 
to give them legal support in resolving internal points of 
contention. To this end, an International Metallurgist Union 
arbitration tribunal has been set up which, on beneficial terms 
and in a short time span, will consider all cases submitted to 
it. It is important that while possessing professional skills in 
the field of metallurgy, the arbitration tribunal is called upon 
to find ways to reconcile the parties and reduce the claimant 
outlays related to the consideration of their cases. 
  Needless to say, several months of the International 
Metallurgist Union activity is a relatively short time for 
preparing and especially implementing serious measures. The 
union is in its formative stages, and new members are still 
joining it. We are not indifferent to the future membership 
makeup of the organization. We are trying to ensure that it is 
replenished with authoritative and skilled experts and 
production leaders characterized by the pride in their work and 
responsible attitude to the future of the industry. During the 
past months, many leaders and prominent experts from metallurgy 
enterprises in CIS countries, scientific research institute 
staff, employees of concerns, Roschermet Corporation, the stock 
market, trading houses, and certain state departments and trade 
unions have become union members. We are hoping that the union 
will continue to expand further by admitting engineering, 
technical, and scientific personnel in the metallurgical and 
mining industries who are committed to their profession and will 
form the intellectual potential of the organization; realization 
of this potential will help solve complicated issues of bringing 
metallurgy out of the critical state and ensuring its future 
balanced developed. 
  Approximately 50 enterprises in organizations from six CIS 
countries which include large integrated iron and steel works, 
specialized plants, scientific production associations, 
institutes, and associations have already joined the 
International Metallurgist Union as collective members. Requests 
have been received about membership terms from several companies 
from noncontiguous foreign countries. It is important to ensure 
that this process continues. Speaking about expanding our 
membership, we must clearly proceed from the principle that the 
union needs enterprises and organizations as the basis for its 
functioning while collective members need the union as the 
organization capable of affecting the resolution of 
contradictions arising due to the new realities of life. 
  It is necessary to emphasize that the newly developed 
metallurgist union does not claim to supplant the functions of 
existing management structures, including metallurgy committees. 
Our primary intention is to assist all union members in various 
states in establishing close contacts on the basis of common and 
mutual interests. Whenever possible, we will undertake to solve 
the problems which are unusual to the new structures but have 
preserved or acquired urgency. The guiding principle of 
interaction with the authorities is mutual respect and 
assistance and the ability to complement each other. Not the 
ambitions but cooperation in the name of normal viability and 
development of industries, enterprises and organizations must 
become the cornerstone of this activity.

<F P=106> [Article by O.N. Soskovets, First Deputy Chairman of the </F>
Russian Federation Council of Ministers] 
  [Text] Metallurgy is one of the base branches of Russia's 
industries and, along with the fuel and energy complex, largely 
determines the viability of her economy. 
  All large industrially developed countries have or strive to 
have their own effectively operating metallurgical industries. 
The developing countries are also pursuing independence in this 
field and are building large metallurgical facilities. 
  The Russian Federation's proportion of the metallurgical 
complex production among the states formerly comprising the USSR 
is 60%. In Russia, ferrous metallurgy is the principal 
supplier 
of structural materials virtually to all branches of the 
national economy and will retain its importance as a basis 
industry for a long time to come. 
  In addition to the petrochemical and forestry industry 
production, domestic ferrous metals are also finding demand in 
the world market. Export of metallurgical raw materials, 
semifinished products, and individual types of ready products is 
an important source of hard currency revenues necessary both for 
the state as a whole and for the specific metallurgy enterprises 
for the purpose of their retooling and development in the social 
sphere. 
  The potential of Russia's ferrous metallurgy is determined 
by 
the production capacities which make it possible to produce the 
following (in million tons per year): 



  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Rolled product                        |67                                    |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  The partitioning of the former Soviet Union was accompanied 
by the breakup of the unified metallurgical complex, a sharp 
drop in the effective demand for metal products, and a worsening 
of the export-import shipment situation. Altogether, the 
production volume at ferrous metallurgy enterprises declined by 
17.5% in 1992 compared to 1991. 
  According to expert estimates, consumption of rolled 
products 
in Russia in 1992 decreased compared to the 1991 level by 8 
million tons (15.5%) and that of steel pipes--by 2.6 
million 
tons (28%). At the same time, certain types of metal 
products 
which are the life blood of the state economy did not find 
sufficient demand): these are transportation metal, rails and 
wheels (up to 30% of natural demand, pipes for operating 
gas 
lines and wells (up to 30%), bearing steel (up to 
40%), and 
rope (up to 20%). As a result, the capacity utilization of 
Russia's metallurgical complex facilities (Fig. 1) has declined. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-15A>           Fig. 1. Utilization Capacity (%) and Production of Principal Types of Metal Items </FIG>




  Ferrous metallurgy has a number of peculiar features which 
worsen its critical condition and call for considerable efforts 
to resolve the long-overdue interrelated problems. The most 
acute of these are the following: 

  -  an increased material-to-output and energy-to-output 
ratios of production; 
  -  a considerable depreciation of fixed production capital which 
exceeds 50% for the industry as a whole and in a number of 
enterprises--70%, and a low production level with the 
attendant 
poor production quality and competitiveness 
  -  a lack of balance in the subindustries and individual process 
stages, especially due to the disruption of relationships in the 
interbranch and intrabranch cooperation with respect to raw 
materials and semifinished products 
  -  extremely unsatisfactory environmental conditions in the 
regions with the metallurgical industry. 

    A lion's share of metallurgical production in Russia is 
manufactured by obsolete technologies using obsolete and aging 
equipment. More than 60% of steel is smelted in open 
hearth 
furnaces and 75% of steel is cast into ingots. More than 
one-half of rolled stock is produced in equipment which is at 
the 1960s level. Consequently, ferrous metallurgy production has 
elevated specific material consumption and power-to-output 
ratio. For a comparable range of assortment, almost three times 
as much waste is produced per ton of ready rolled stock than in 
Japan while the energy consumption is higher by one-third. As a 
result of an increase in consumption of resources and 
considerable labor outlays compared to today's levels, 
production expenditures at domestic enterprises are in most 
cases higher than the price of metal products in the world 
market, using world prices as a reference. Tentative estimates 
show that even at enterprises with some features of modern 
technologies, the physical and energy outlays per ton of rolled 
products in Russia are $50-70 higher than at today's foreign 
plants. 
  The principal reasons for the energy resource overruns in 
the 
principal process stages are the lower iron concentration in the 
burden, a high fines concentration in the sinter, a high 
proportion of open hearth production, a low proportion of steel 
cast in continuous casting machines (MNLZ), and a large number 
of blooming mills. Due to the technical backwardness of Russia's 
ferrous metallurgy and the resulting high production costs, 
annual losses reach $3.5-4.0 billion. 
  The breakup of the unified metallurgical complex hit 
especially hard the mineral and raw material base of ferrous 
metallurgy. Today, such metallurgical enterprises in Southern 
Urals as the Magnitogorsk Integrated Iron and Steel Works, 
Orsk-Khalilovo Integrated Iron and Steel Works, Chelyabinsk 
Integrated Iron and Steel Works, and partially the Western 
Siberian Integrated Iron and Steel Works use iron ore raw 
materials which are brought from Central Russia (up to 10 
million t/yr) and even from Kazakhstan (up to 9 million t/yr), 
yet stable shipments from these areas are far from being assured. 
  There are no deposits or enterprises which mine manganese 
and 
chromium ores whose principal reserves are located in Ukraine 
and Kazakhstan. The raw material base of the refractory industry 
is insufficient due to the depletion of the Satka magnesite 
deposit as well as the scarcity of fireclay mined in Russia. 
  Due to the considerable obsolescence of capital stock, 
metallurgy is inflicting considerable harm on the environment 
which is estimated to reach 400-450 billion rubles a year. An 
increasing stringency of environmental standards and 
requirements and the introduction of economic sanctions will 
lead to considerable economic losses for enterprises which do 
not meet these requirements. While at foreign plants with a 
total metallurgy cycle and advanced practices equipped with the 
most recent scrubbing equipment, dust ejection into the 
atmosphere reaches 1,000 t/yr per 1 million tons of steel, at 
Russian plants this indicator is several times higher (see 
table).

  Under the conditions where the metal production and 
metallurgical raw material consumption in Russia has decreased, 
the importance of export shipments is on the rise. Since the 
world market for ferrous metals has already evolved almost fully 
and is characterized by traditional ``spheres of influence,'' a 
thorough study of the issue of large metal batch shipments and a 
search for new mutually acceptable forms are necessary for 
penetrating it. 
  Russia's economy has suffered considerable harm due to an 
uncontrolled export of metals, including secondary metals. Thus, 
the use of ferrous metal scrap in production decreased by 6 
million tons in Russia in 1992 for this reason. 
  Today, the Western European and North and Central American 
markets virtually cannot expand due to the high custom duties, 
protectionist measures, and stiff competition. At the same time, 
the importance of traditional Eastern European markets for us is 
increasing while interest in Asian and African markets is on the 
rise. 
  Yet the high resource-to-output ratio of production combined 
with an insufficient quality level lead to a low competitiveness 
of most types of ready products from Russia's ferrous 
metallurgy, and only 10-15% of ready metal products can 
compete 
in the world market: electrical sheet steel (partially), 
reinforcement steel, alloy bars, rails, shipbuilding sheet 
steel, and certain other types as well as semifinished products, 
e.g., pig iron, process stage blanks, and hot-rolled coils. 
  An estimate of the likely internal and external ferrous 
metal 
market capacity makes it possible to predict the production 
volumes of rolled products to be 47-39 million tons in 1995 and 
50-55 million tons in 2000. According to expert forecasts, the 
production, domestic consumption, and exports of rolled products 
(in millions of tons) will stabilize in the next two-to-three 
years and increase somewhat by 2000.

  One should treat this forecast with considerable skepticism 
since it is based on the 1992 macroeconomic indicators which may 
change with time. One should also emphasize that ferrous 
metallurgy is characterized by considerable lagging, so crisis 
phenomena in it may be more prolonged than in the national 
economy as a whole, while the freeing of prices for the energy 
resources will inevitably aggravate the crisis since it will 
result in an invasion of imported metal products under the 
conditions where our enterprises are not competitive. 
  An analysis of the general economic conditions and the state 
of ferrous metallurgy in Russia makes it possible to draw the 
conclusion that if necessary measures in retooling the industry 
and protecting the domestic market from imported metal products 
during the modernization period as well as ensuring a controlled 
price increase for energy resources are not taken, Russian 
metallurgy will virtually cease to exist. 
  Mindful of the world experience and the economic futility of 
winding down domestic metallurgy and aiming at importing metal 
products, Russia is left with no alternatives to radical 
modernization of metallurgical production. 
  At the same time, the performance of enterprises in 1992 
demonstrated that the overhaul and retooling measures in the 
industry, including those taken at government levels, do not 
resolve a number of acute problems in the industry. Mindful of 
the fact that the task of supplying the national economy with 
metal products with the requisite quality and assortment, mostly 
the agroindustrial and fuel and energy complex, developing 
production of durable consumer goods and communication and 
transportation facilities, maintaining Russia's defense 
capabilities at the necessary level, and developing the expert 
potential while increasing the proportion of ready products as 
well as a cardinal improvement in the environmental conditions 
in the metallurgical regions is of paramount importance, the 
Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy developed a draft of 
the national program of "Metallurgy Retooling and Development in 
Russia." 
  Completion of the program will require efforts both on part 
of the state and on part of the Metallurgical Enterprise and 
Scientific Research and Design Institute staff and management. 
The program pinpoints key issues of industrial development and 
outlines the specific and effective ways of resolving them. 
According to the program, a reduction in expenditures for 
production, primarily a decrease in the energy-to-output ratio 
and specific material consumption of production, a decrease in 
labor outlays, and an improvement in production quality 
indicators will be responsible for ensuring the economic 
efficiency of production, profitability of ferrous metallurgy 
enterprises, and guaranteeing that they receive the resources 
necessary for normal operation, including the development of 
their expert potential. 
  Realization of the national program will enable the industry 
to develop on the basis of domestic scientific developments and 
domestic equipment. This will require a system of state support 
for promising scientific developments, preservation of the 
scientific and technical potential, and financing of basic 
scientific research. 
  The retooling of metallurgy must be carried out by 
effectively utilizing the economic capabilities of the 
enterprises themselves and with state support. The principal 
problems whose solution requires state support are as follows: 
lowering the outlays of physical, energy, and labor resources; 
improving the product quality in developing new types of 
products; increasing the product competitiveness; maximizing the 
utilization and developing a domestic raw material base; and 
improving the environmental conditions. 
  State support for retooling may be expressed in various 
forms: the state should primarily make sure that highly 
efficient measures are realized primarily at the expense of 
enterprise profits thus developing the necessary prerequisites 
for the beneficial profit development conditions, e.g., export 
and import duties, credits, tax regulations, etc. 
  The program calls for the following principal technological 
production modernization trends: 

  -  comprehensively utilizing raw materials; 
  -  increasing the ore dressing degree and maximizing the scrap 
metal utilization in order to lower the energy outlays; 
  -  improving the steel melting production structure by replacing 
open hearth furnaces with modern steel melting units with steel 
casting in continuous casting machines; 
  -  setting production of individual types of metal items which 
lower the specific metal content in the national income, 
including cold rolled sheets, corrosion protected metal 
products, cold roll formed sections, etc.; 
  -  minimizing transportation outlays for raw material, 
semifinished products, and ready production shipments and 
outlays of energy resources and other materials; 
  -  maximizing the utilization of the secondary resources forming 
in the national economy. 

    Pursuant to the draft program, 60 installations at 32 
enterprises are being modernized, overhauled, or replaced 
(altogether, there are more than 200 enterprises in ferrous 
metallurgy). 
  It is expected that the national program will be carried out 
in two stages during which the following capacities will be 
brought onstream, in thousands of tons:

  Commissioning of new capacities after implementation of the 
first stage will make it possible to retire obsolete equipment, 
increase the proportion of steel made using advanced processes 
to 53.3% and continuous steel casting--to 31.6%, 
decrease the 
steel consumption for rolled products by 1.4 million tons, coke 
for pig iron--by 2.8 million tons, pig iron for steel--by 1.0 
million tons, and energy resources--by 1 million tons of 
standard fuel. 
  Implementation of the second phase will make it possible to 
increase the proportion of advanced processes to 70% and 
continuous casting--to 69%. Additionally, the metal 
outlays for 
rolled products will decrease by 2.3 million tons, pig iron for 
steel--by 1.8 million tons, and energy resources--by 1.6 million 
tons of standard fuel. 
  The use of new practices will make it possible to improve 
the 
production competitiveness, increase the expert potential, and 
reduce harmful discharges by 2.5-3 times. 
  Realization of high-priority Phase I measures stipulated by 
the national program calls for up to 300,000 tons of equipment 
and for Phase II--approximately 100,000 tons. A list from 
Sukhumi. A list of installed and upgraded equipment necessary 
for implementing the stipulated measures is summarized below:

  Domestic process equipment developed and installed in recent 
years is inferior to similar foreign equipment with respect to 
productivity, reliability, production quality, power-to-output 
ratio, mass, and overall dimensions. Thus, the metal-to-output 
ratio of the slab machines is 20% higher than that of 
similar 
foreign units while the metal casting rate is 30-40% 
lower, 
which considerably decreases their productivity. 
  The domestic machine-building industry does not manufacture 
many types of modern equipment for the fourth process stage 
shops, electrolytic tinplating and chrome plating devices, 
electrolytic cold rolled sheet zinc plating and aluminum plating 
machines, light quenching machines, strip grinding and polishing 
machines, continuous production lines for heat treatment of 
bands, and various types of dressing equipment. Principally new 
devices have not been developed for manufacturing pipes, 
nondestructive welding quality control testing devices, and pipe 
dressing machines. 
  It is patently obvious that metallurgy must be retooled on 
the basis of utilizing modern process equipment while maximizing 
the utilization of domestic machinebuilder capabilities and 
using the experience and developments of the leading foreign 
companies and even bringing them in whenever necessary. At the 
same time, we should vigorously utilize the capabilities of 
military industrial complex (VPK) enterprises which have a 
powerful engineering and production potential. 
  We need a new approach to the operation of design 
organizations. Their principal task has evolved into a thorough 
economic analysis of the conditions at enterprises, developing 
optimum solutions for maintaining and developing the production 
potential allowing for an increase in the competitiveness and 
production quality. As a rule, design decisions must be made on 
a competitive basis. 
  Implementation of the country's national metallurgy 
development program will call for new approaches from builders, 
assembly workers, and clients to construction and modernization 
of installations. Construction and modernization terms of 
complex installations must not exceed 3.5 years and must ensure 
high quality. The contractor for carrying out the work should be 
selected on a competitive basis allowing for the terms, quality, 
and agreed-upon costs. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-18A>           Fig. 2. Outlays for Financing the Russian National Metallurgy Development Program: On </FIG>




  Overall, implementation of the measures outlined by the 
ferrous metallurgy retooling and development program will call 
for 1.6 trillion rubles at today's prices and $6.8 billion (Fig. 
2). Calculations show that the facilities necessary for 
financing the program can be raised due to internal enterprise 
resources and by engaging production user, commercial structure, 
and foreign investor resources (Fig. 3). The shortfall can be 
covered by state support.

  The Russian government must make the following decisions in 
order to provide assistance at a state level: 

  -  Maintain for the time being the adopted procedure for 
forming centralized off-budget resources due to the cost of 
production. 
  -  Extend to the enterprises participating in national program 
implementation the procedure for acquiring abroad the equipment 
which cannot be manufactured in Russia on the basis of 
credit-compensation transactions. 
  -  Free the enterprises, partially or fully, from paying customs 
duties (both export and import) in exporting the products which 
ensures hard currency earnings for purchases of process 
equipment, spares, and accessory parts. 
  -  Free the enterprises from the mandatory sale of 50% 
of foreign 
currency to the state, provided that it is used for equipment 
purchases. 
  -  Establish a procedure for transferring to the enterprise 
balance sheet the installations built due to foreign exchange 
resources at a special investment exchange rate which reflects 
the real correlation of currencies thus ensuring the 
competitiveness of metal products and largely limiting metal 
price increases. 
  -  The profits used for investment should not be taxed 
regardless 
of the amount 
  National program implementation will make it possible to 
raise 
the technical level of Russia's metallurgy, improve the 
competitiveness of domestic metal products, save jobs, radically 
improve the environmental conditions, and avoid imports. The 
total economic impact will reach approximately $3.0 billion 
annually. It is also expected that the enterprise profits may 
increase by approximately 300 billion rubles due to an 
improvement in the metal production quality and assortment. 
Furthermore, according to expert estimates, elimination of 
imports of one million tons of rolled products will make it 
possible to save approximately 10,000 metalmaker jobs which 
would otherwise require approximately 60 trillion rubles 
necessary to create these jobs. 
  Implementation of the national program measures is based on 
the mutual responsibility of the state and the enterprise: the 
state must ensure financial benefits for the program measures 
while the enterprise--meet the deadlines and ensure that each 
measure is carried out at a technical and economic level 
stipulated by the contract. In all, if the necessary investment 
and state support regime are ensured, the ferrous metallurgy 
modernization program may be largely completed by 2000-2005. 
  A radical modernization of Russia's metallurgy is an 
objective necessity and despite the considerable investments 
necessary for its implementation is economically efficient. 
Realization of the entire program should be ensured by 
implementing the clearly defined comprehensive development 
programs for each enterprise and region which will reflect 
high-priority problems with the specific mechanisms of solving 
them. The Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy and 
economic and commercial structures set up by the metallurgical 
enterprises (corporations, concerns, the international 
metallurgy union, etc.) will participate in developing the 
specific measures under the program. 
  Successful implementation of the program is possible only in 
the case where each metallurgist and metalmaker at his workplace 
clearly understands the objectives and goals of the program and 
makes his own contribution to their realization.

  [Text] In the foreseeable future, steels and alloys will 
remain the principal structural materials; this is dictated by 
the broad range of their physical and mechanical properties, 
relatively low cost, and a well-developed raw material and 
technological production base. 
  The conditions of a market economy determine the 
characteristic features in approaching the development and 
production of new metallic materials,[.sup]1[/] improving 
traditional materials, and using new and improved materials in 
products. Moreover, the new materials play the role of a 
commodity which has the consumer properties satisfying the buyer 
and bring profit to the producer. 
  A number of aspects of the movement of new materials to the 
metal products market is considered in the article. 
  Stimuli and incentives for developing new 
materials. The new metallic materials can successfully 
reach the market under the following conditions: 
1. there are no similar products in the existing market, and 
the use of new materials opens up new opportunities for 
developing products, i.e., a free ``niche'' exists. 
2. existing similar metal products are inferior to the new 
products in quality, and production of new items is more 
profitable. 
  Materials with a completely new set of properties open up 
the 
possibility of developing a new products market. Materials, as a 
rule, are developed simultaneously with designing a product, 
i.e., custom-developed. Examples of this approach are the 
simultaneous development of a new category of amorphous alloys 
and the most recent modifications of pulse transformers and the 
separation of the spheres of influence between metallic soft 
magnetic alloys and semiconductor ferrites. 
  The opposite used to be true, i.e., the new material was 
``looking for'' its applications or, in other words, the product 
was being developed for existing metal. This happened, e.g., 
when superconducting alloys and cryogenic power engineering and 
cryoelectronic products [2] were being developed simultaneously 
on the basis of the discovery of the high-temperature 
superconductivity phenomenon [1]. Production of the principally 
new materials often cannot be realized by traditional production 
methods using conventional equipment and calls for new designs. 
Oriented crystallization of eutectic alloys, impregnation of 
frame matrices with alloys, explosive impact methods, metal film 
sputtering, etc., can serve as examples. 
  As we have already mentioned, these types of materials 
figure 
primarily in the new sector of the metal products market. 
  Another sector of the metal products market is characterized 
by displacement of ``classical'' traditional metal products by 
new materials. In this case, a higher level of properties blazes 
the trail to the market for the new material thus ensuring a 
higher quality of products or their greater adaptability to 
streamlined manufacture, a decrease in production costs, an 
improvement in the product reliability, etc. 
  IF-steels (especially deep drawing and without free 
interstitial atoms) and clad steels for the automotive industry 
are examples of such materials. Materials whose properties are 
at the level of classical analogs yet cheaper due to efficient 
alloying, e.g., nickel-free stainless steel and tungsten-free 
tool steels can also be classified as belonging to this group. 
These classes of materials are developed, as a rule, on the 
basis of improving their production practices (ensuring a 
specified chemical composition, steel purity, more stringent 
allowances, using heat treatment, improving the surface finish, 
etc.). 
  Since materials, as a rule, are semi-finished products for 
making items while the products as a commodity have a certain 
life cycle in their market [3], the life cycle of the material 
also depends on it. For example, metallic and film memory 
elements developed for early-generation computers ceased their 
existence together with these types of computers. High-purity 
metals and alloys developed for designing vacuum tubes in 
early-generation radio and TV devices were also not used in 
subsequent generations of electronic equipment. As a result of 
the further development of these skill-intensive industries, 
metals were no longer used in new-generation products--the metal 
was displaced by semiconductors, ferrites, and other materials. 
The life cycle of a multifunction material, as a rule, is longer 
than that of the materials custom-designed for a specific 
product. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-20A> Fig. 1. Dependence of the Cost of the Unit of Properties (Curve 1) and Aggregate Outlays </FIG>




  Economics of materials with new qualities. The 
development and production management of new or improved 
materials are fraught, as a rule, with additional production 
outlays. In principle, the production process can be arranged in 
such a way so as to ensure a predetermined degree of 
approximation of the physical limits of this class of material 
properties. Yet the economic expediency of such approximation 
under market conditions is far from always justified. An 
analysis demonstrates that each unit of "gain" in properties 
calls for progressively increasing production outlays (Fig. 1). 
The cost of material whose range of properties is close to the 
physical limit C[.sup]0[/] is substantially higher 
than the cost of mass-produced material with a traditional range 
of properties C[.sup]1[/]. For the consumer, it is 
more profitable to deal with a commercial level of properties 
(the C[.sup]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/] range) 
which is higher than the traditional level but lower than the 
physical. Under market conditions, the commercial level forms as 
a function of the specific demand for the material, the product 
market opportunities, and the product's specific metal 
consumption. The commercial level of properties may not coincide 
with the design level of properties C[.sup]4[/] 
with respect to the material parameters on whose basis the 
engineering design of the product is made. The degree of 
discrepancy between the design and commercial property levels 
(the difference between the 
C[.sup]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/] range and 
C[.sup]4[/]) characterizes the material 
utilization level in the product: given 
C[.sup]4[/]&lt;C[.sub]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/], 
the material properties are underutilized; given 
C[.sup]4[/]&gt; C[.sub]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/], 
the specific metal content in the product increases since the 
shortfall in the property level has to be compensated for by an 
excessive amount of material (e.g., for increasing the net 
section in order to ensure a specified strength or operating 
magnetic induction of the product). 
  In the case where 
C[.sup]4[/]&gt; C[.sub]2[/]-C[.sub]3[/], 
we may be dealing with an economic paradox: despite the 
discrepancy between the design and commercial property levels, 
an elevated metal expenditure may turn out to be economically 
justified if the smaller quantity of metal with higher 
properties costs more than a greater quantity of relatively 
cheaper metal. For this reason, in particular, anisotropic 
electrical sheet steel exposed to laser treatment (the 
properties are improved by 8% and the cost rises by 
15%) has 
limited applications [4]. 
  Consequently, the use of a new material whose applications 
in 
a product ensures a decrease in aggregate production and 
operation outlays compared to the one it substitutes can be 
considered economically efficient. 
  Operating properties, reliability, and competitiveness 
of materials. After the engineering analysis of the product 
is completed, the consumer, in the final analysis, is no longer 
interested by the primary physical characteristics of the 
material (ultimate tensile strength, density, magnetic 
permeability, etc.) but rather the ability of the material as a 
whole reliably to perform certain functions, ensure the 
serviceability of the product, and guarantee the lowest 
manufacturing outlays (adaptability to production). Naturally, 
these comprehensive characteristics are largely determined by 
the primary ones yet the final assessment of the material (the 
material fits or does not fit) is made only in conjunction with 
the product and by the product's market suitability, i.e., the 
product's consumer appeal and economic characteristics. 
  The operating properties of the material and supply 
reliability must be ensured by the manufacturer technology 
level. The metal consumer must be confident in the producer's 
goods. Thus, as a result of many years of tradition at American 
automotive companies, a certain procedure developed in the 
relationships with metal suppliers. Each car part is made from 
metal supplied by only one vendor who managed to 
attain consistently high quality of metal products. Such 
producers are awarded quality certificates by the automotive 
plants. Such a quality certificate enables the metal supplier to 
hope that car manufacturers "will let them supply one more 
part." The USS Corporation is one of the first U.S. 
metallurgical companies supplying automotive sheets and it has 
received Ford and Chrysler quality certificates. 
  In certifying metal products, the Ford Motor Company 
proceeds 
from meeting the four principles of interrelation with metal 
suppliers: 

  -  the quality of metal supplied (50 points on a scale of 
100); 
  -  timely and predictable shipments (20 points) 
  -  metal product price (20 points) 
  -  supplier participation in jointly developing and finishing 
the 
metal products together with the user (10 points). 
  -  It is important that the price competition is assigned 
priority 
number three (20 points) while the shipment quality and 
regularity move to the forefront (a total of 70 out of 100 
points!). 

    Foreign (especially Japanese) automobile producers [5] are 
being increasingly transplanted to the United States in recent 
years. Japanese automobile manufacturers have established that 
the automobile body sheet produced by metallurgical enterprises 
in the United States and used by American customers does not 
meet Japanese requirements [6]. An assessment of 14 quality 
parameters shows that American steel is inferior to Japanese 
with respect to the seven most important parameters (the coat 
quality, surface finish, suitability for drawing, geometric 
tolerances, etc.). Thus, the automobile body sheet market 
becomes closed, and it is very difficult for nontraditional 
metal producers to penetrate it. It is expected that competition 
will heat up even more in the automobile body sheet market due 
to the fact that construction of units for applying coats in a 
number of countries (Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, 
and South Korea) has acquired elements of obsession according to 
the analytical report by P. Marcus to the Eighth Congress of 
``Ferrous Metallurgy Survival Strategy'' held in 1992. 
Furthermore, in a short run, ``...a major battle will develop 
among plastic and aluminum sheets and various types of clad 
steels in the automobile body sheet market'' [7].

  A general assessment of the service properties of materials 
can be complemented by the concept of material reliability which 
is especially important for the material operating under extreme 
conditions. Reliability is a comprehensive material 
characteristic and determines its ability to ensure the product 
serviceability within a specified time interval under the effect 
of external damaging factors [8]. A classification of the 
external factors and the character of the resulting metal damage 
are summarized in the table. The character of the material 
damage development under a constant effect of a certain external 
factor (or a group of factors) where the operating parameter 
changes exponentially with time (Fig. 2) is representative. The 
product fails when the working parameter goes beyond the 
operating range 
P[.sup]1[/]-P[.sub]2[/]. The 
reliable material operation span (Curve 2) may be 
increased by stabilizing treatment, e.g., aging or thermal 
cycling. Ensuring reliability is the most important condition of 
guaranteeing the ability of the material to perform its 
operating functions. A guarantee of reliability calls for 
additional material producer and supplier outlays related to 
more stringent production practices, the need for stabilizing 
treatments, accelerated reliability tests, and reliability 
forecasts. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-22A> Fig. 2. Material Vulnerability Curves Without (1) and With (2) Stabilizing </FIG>




  Another important aspect of the issue of ensuring product 
reliability which depends on the material is its maintainability 
[8], i.e., preserving the necessary product performance level by 
changing the failed material. This problem is related to the 
supplier's ability to provide materials whose parameters are at 
the level of the initial parameters of the failed material. For 
the material supplier, solution of this problem involves 
adjusting the technology for producing metal batches with 
identical properties, improving the chemical, structural, phase, 
and geometrical homogeneity of the metal which leads to 
additional production costs due to the need to maintain a high 
level of production culture, stringent requirements for the raw 
material quality and homogeneity, etc. In this case, the 
question of what is more economically expedient--to tighten up 
the production process in order to prevent rejects or allow a 
certain amount of rejection but ensure that off-grade metal is 
taken out [9]--cannot be a priori answered 
unambiguously. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-22B>           Fig. 3. Material Property Distribution Curve (Surface); Vertical axis--Frequency </FIG>




  The coincidence of the properties of the original (failed) 
material and its substitution has a probablistic character and 
is described by a material property distribution curve with a 
transition from batch to batch as well as within each batch. The 
narrowing of the distribution curve by technological methods or 
rejecting the metal which does not fall within the operating 
parameter range 
P[.sup]1[/]-P[.sub]2[/](P&lt;P[.sub]1[/] 
and P&gt; P[.sup]2[/]) also leads to 
additional producer costs. In the case where the practices are 
tightened up in order to optimize the material produced with 
respect to several parameters, we are witnessing the narrowing 
the volumetric distribution curve. For example, for the two 
parameters P and S (Fig. 3), optimization 
means that both parameters fall within area 1-2-3-4. Naturally, 
this problem is much more complex than optimization by a single 
parameter. At times, different parameters have opposite behavior 
trends in which case the optimization task becomes even more 
complicated. 
  The problem of metal homogeneity is directly related to the 
issue of the product's specific metal consumption. The 
reliability of the entire structure depends not only on the 
specific characteristics of the material, but also on the cross 
section margin necessary for decreasing the metal damage 
probability due to local deviation of the characteristics from 
the mean specific value. The probability of local deviations is 
determined by the material homogeneity, i.e., the distribution 
curve and, in the final analysis, the degree of technological 
rigidity. 
  As we have already mentioned, a guarantee of reliability is 
especially important for materials under extreme conditions. 
Thus, e.g., according to data in [10], the requirements imposed 
on the materials used in making sea-based aircraft are more 
stringent in a number of cases than those for space equipment (a 
high strength combined with a low specific gravity, resistance 
to cyclical loads in a corrosive medium at temperatures of up to 
1,150, etc.). Composite metallurgy methods (production of 
composites on the basis of intermetallic compounds), powder 
metallurgy methods (engineering ceramics and materials for 
specialty bearings operating in corrosive media under high loads 
and high temperatures), single crystal and quasisingle crystal 
metallurgy, and specialized coat application methods (heat 
protecting, corrosion resistant, etc.) are used for developing 
such materials for specific products. 
  According to forecasts by the Japanese Ministry of Trade and 
Industry [11], the need for specialty materials for operation 
under extreme conditions will increase rapidly and by 2000 
exceed the 1989 consumption level by several times. This is 
primarily true for the following classes of materials: 
intermetallic compounds with a high strength and heat 
resistance, alloys with a high resistance to biological and 
physiological media, and high-temperature superconductors. The 
demand for materials which determine energy conservation and 
microelectronics development [11, 12], i.e., amorphous alloys, 
microheterogeneous (including nanocrystalline) alloys, 
multilayer composites (including metal-ceramics), materials with 
an amorphized surface, and hydrogen accumulating materials for 
hydrogen engines, etc., will increase sharply. New modifications 
of traditional materials must also be developed, e.g.: stainless 
steel micrometer-thick fibers for woven materials and screens, 
reinforced concrete in seismically resistant structures and 
nuclear reactors, and reinforced refractory products [12]. The 
issues of developing the aforementioned classes of materials are 
resolved especially effectively in places where material 
producer and item producer integration has been achieved. 
  An analysis shows that one can win customers in a saturated 
market only by offering a commodity which has advantages 
compared to competing products and which meets user demands at a 
higher level. Under these conditions, the metal product 
competitiveness becomes especially important [13]. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-23A>           Fig. 4. Dependence of the Competitiveness Differential </FIG>




  The competitiveness of metal products as a commodity is a 
comparative comprehensive estimate of the totality of 
qualitative and economic properties (parameters) relative to the 
market requirements or the properties of a similar (or 
substituted) commodity. A quantitative estimate of the 
competitiveness level K is made on the basis of 
developed procedures [14] and, in the final analysis, is 
expressed through the free parametric quality index 
I[.sup]p[/] and the free parametric economic index 
I[.sup]c[/] (the difference between the quality 
parameters of this commodity and a similar commodity per unit of 
production outlays): 
  K = 
I[.sup]p[/]/I[.sub]c[/]. 
  Given K&gt; 1, the commodity is more competitive than 
the analog while given K&lt;1, it is less so. The metal 
product competitiveness level is especially sensitive to the 
range of consumer appeal (I[.sup]p[/]) at low 
outlays--small fluctuations in the value of the 
I[.sup]p[/] index require a high degree of 
customer satisfaction with quality in order to maintain a high 
level of competitiveness (Fig. 4). Thus, the nonprice 
competition factors come to the forefront at low outlays. This 
is taken into account by experienced material producers [15]. In 
practice, the situation with assessing the competitiveness is 
much more complicated since the I[.sup]p[/] and 
I[.sup]c[/] indices are independent. Thus, 
according to data in [16], an increase in the degree to which 
the metal product consumer requirements are met (the 
I[.sup]p[/] index) from 90 to 95% is fraught with 
almost doubling the metal producer outlays (the 
I[.sup]c[/] index). On the other hand, production 
of higher-quality items gradually leads to a decrease in 
production outlays due to an increase in the production quality 
and a decrease in rejections and outlays for additional product 
finishing [15]. 
  In penetrating the free market, the new producers must take 
into account all possible factors. We can cite examples where 
given similar expenditure and consumer appeal levels, the 
materials capture markets due to traditional customer loyalties. 
Thus, the well-known can war led to a division of the metallic 
beverage container market: the Coca Cola Company prefers 
aluminum cans while Pepsi Cola--steel cans [17]. 
  Material property standardization principles. As 
we have already mentioned, while possessing a broad range of 
diverse properties, the same types of metal products, as a rule, 
are used in items for very different purposes, i.e., are 
multifunctional. This determines the specific features of 
unifying the properties in standards and other regulatory 
technical documents. 
  In standardizing production, the indicators used in all 
application versions must be mandatory (base); the remaining 
requirements are optional and become mandatory only upon 
additional agreement (contract) between the producers and 
consumers. Sometimes, it is sufficient to have reliable 
reference data on a range of properties cited in an appendix to 
the standard or a supplier company catalogue. This approach 
takes into account the mutual interest of the producers and 
consumers and ensures their constructive technical dialogue and, 
in the final analysis, metal product utilization effectiveness. 
This standardization principle is widely used in foreign 
standards and is reflected in all newly developed domestic 
regulatory technical documents. 
  The set of properties for new materials for specific 
purposes 
(developed for the specific product) must be standardized and 
mandatory with respect to the service characteristics of the 
product indicating the procedures for measuring these properties. 
  The chemical element composition standards for steel and 
alloy properties for specific applications must be strictly 
regulated. For multifunction metal products, rigid 
standardization of the chemical composition is unacceptable 
since in order to ensure a specific range of requested 
properties, one must be able to manipulate the chemical 
composition to a certain extent. 
  Depending on whether the product is crucial, the 
requirements 
for the level to which the properties regulated by the standards 
are ensured differ. Thus, experience shows that for metal 
products used in construction, this norm is at least 0.95 but 
for more crucial applications--0.97 or more. In addition to the 
requirement to ship products in accordance with international or 
national standards of technically advanced countries, the 
manufacturer penetrating an external market must ensure that all 
contract requirements are met and guarantee the quality 
stability of the shipped products which, as a rule, is confirmed 
by the export production certification by acknowledged 
international or national societies (the British Lloyd Register, 
the German TGF, the American Oil and Gas Institute, etc.) 
  One should keep in mind that certification of the product 
shipped is an initial phase of certification as a supplier 
warranty, while certification of the system ensuring the quality 
in effect at the manufacturing enterprise should serve as the 
concluding phase. The requirements for ensuring the quality 
system are described in ISO 9000 standards [18]. 
<H5>  Summary </H5>
  The specific features of the development, production, and 
application of new metallic materials under market economy 
conditions are considered. Under the conditions where new 
materials become a market commodity, such market material 
characteristics as competitiveness, new property standardization 
principles, commercial quality level, life cycle, and the ratio 
of the material and product economics are significant. These 
categories determine the ability of the new materials to become 
a commodity profitable for both the producers and the consumers.

Organization of Labor in Nonferrous Metallurgy; UDC 334:669.2] 
  [Text] Russia's metallurgical complex consisting of 
hundreds of independent enterprises and ferrous and nonferrous 
metallurgy organizations represents 24 large subbranches of the 
industry each of which has clearly defined specific features of 
production, its own practices, equipment, units and machines, 
and specially trained personnel. In essence, each subbranch is 
an independent base branch of the industry with a high value of 
fixed capital. 
  Mining operations have a discrete and cyclic character and 
depend on the systematically changing natural conditions (the 
tempo and scale of geological exploration efforts, the 
availability of mineral deposits and their quality, the deposit 
occurrence conditions and location, etc.). 
  Most ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy enterprises are 
characterized by a continuity of production processes and the 
availability of numerous installations with a high unit capacity 
closely interrelated in a single production process. 
Furthermore, individual subindustries and enterprises are linked 
to each other by constant cooperative shipments. 
  The high capital-to-output ratio of mining and metallurgical 
production and a continuous increase (in recent years) in the 
fast metal production tempo without sufficient capital 
investments for replacing the fixed capital led to a sharp drop 
in operating ore extraction production capacities and wear and 
obsolescence of the capital stock. 
  The production processes used in production systems 
operating 
in metallurgy can explain the rather complicated and tense 
environmental situation which developed in various vast Russian 
regions. Suffice it to say that atmospheric discharges of 
harmful substances by metallurgical complex enterprises reach 
27% of all Russian enterprise discharges while 
contaminated 
water effluents exceed 15%. 
  The need to address a broad range of global issues related 
to 
decreasing harmful substance discharges over large territories 
and air and water space and improving the working conditions and 
daily life of metallurgical enterprise workers led to 
considerable increases in the cost of production and a drop in 
the effectiveness and profitability of individual productions, 
enterprises, and subindustries since improvements in the air and 
water quality involve considerable expenditures. 
  Thus, operating metallurgical complex enterprises are 
characterized by the high cost of fixed capital and its 
considerable wear and obsolescence (more than 50%), vast 
outlays for solving environmental and social problems, and the 
existence of marginally profitable or unprofitable 
infrastructure both at enterprises and individual subindustries. 
  The economic reforms which have been carried out in recent 
years and involve changes in managing the enterprises and the 
industry as a whole, improving cost accounting, self-financing, 
raw material and metal price deregulation, profit taxation, and 
limitations in the wage fund did not sufficiently take into 
account (or to be more precise, did not take into account at 
all) these very important characteristics of mining, dressing, 
mining-metallurgical, and processing enterprises in Russia's 
basic industry of the national economy--metallurgy. 
  As a result, instead of stabilization and an increase in the 
production effectiveness, we are witnessing its sharp decrease, 
while the mining extractive and metallurgical enterprises which 
produce metals and items crucial for other enterprises and 
industries have become marginally profitable or unprofitable. 
The situation in the metallurgical complex is continuing to 
deteriorate, pig iron and steel production and smelting are 
dropping, rolled stock and steel pipe production is declining, 
and nonferrous metallurgy enterprises are in a critical state 
due to a deterioration of their supplies of raw material 
resources and intensive retirement of ore capacities from 
operation. 
  An analysis of the status quo in metallurgy demonstrates 
that 
by late 1992, the drop in the production of individual types of 
metals will reach 50% compared to the preceding year 
which, in 
turn, will lead to an even greater reduction in the production 
volume in mechanical engineering and the output of industrial 
goods for consumer use. 
  The principal reasons of the declining production in 
metallurgy are shortfalls in the shipments of coking coal, a 
considerable scarcity of scrap metal due to the absence of 
market mechanisms for its collection and an increasing volume of 
its imports, a sharp decrease in mining and metallurgical 
equipment shipments, a noticeable and ever-increasing gap 
between the economic and business links under intergovernmental, 
interbranch, and industry-wide cooperation, and the lack of 
economic and social incentives for stabilizing and increasing 
the production volume and stable financial conditions of the 
enterprises. 
  The measures taken in 1992 to deepen the economic reforms 
which involve divestment and privatization of enterprises 
pursuant to the state privatization program and Russian 
Federation Presidential Decree No. 721 of 1 Jul 92 which cite as 
an example the critical situation which has developed in the 
metallurgical complex lead to a rather definite conclusion: the 
economic reforms already underway call for a radical correction 
in order to take into account the characteristic features of the 
basic branches of industry without which future realization of 
the measures to expand and deepen the privatization processes 
becomes questionable and reinforces the continuing slide and 
decrease in the production effectiveness. 
  The state privatization program of state and municipal 
enterprises in 1992 is largely aimed at privatizing small- and 
medium-size enterprises in the retail trade, consumer services, 
and transportation spheres whose balance sheets show a 
relatively low cost of property and does not take into account 
the characteristic features of large enterprises which include 
most of metallurgical complex enterprises. 
  Furthermore, the cost of property has risen substantially by 
the end of 1992 due to a multiple increase in the cost of 
working capital which, in a number of cases, exceeded the cost 
of fixed capital by tens and hundreds of times. 
  This jump-like increase in the cost of enterprise property 
limited the ability of the employees to buy out this property 
and required a more detailed analysis and economic feasibility 
of the issues related to assessing the cost of property, 
classifying the enterprise infrastructure objects according to 
various forms of property, and taking into account the interests 
of kindred industries which are a part of a consolidated 
production process with the privatized enterprise in buying out 
a proportion of shares of the joint stock company formed on the 
basis of this enterprise. 
  With respect to the foregoing, the deadlines set up by the 
presidential decree for transforming state enterprises into 
publicly traded joint stock companies (by 1 Nov 92) turned out 
to be unrealistic and led to hasty, economically unjustified, 
and at times inefficient decisions. 
  Thus, out of the total number of metallurgical complex 
enterprises and organizations already transformed into joint 
stock companies in 1992, no more than 25% of such 
entities met 
the deadline (1 Oct 92) in holding employee meetings 
(conferences) and submitting the necessary privatization 
documents to the Russian Federation government, Russian 
Federation State Committee on Property, and committees for 
controlling the property of local administrations. 
  Among the large metallurgical complex enterprises which 
successfully, and in a timely fashion, completed the preparation 
and submission of the necessary documents (privatization plans, 
property assessment documents, and joint stock company articles 
of incorporation) to appropriate state property control bodies 
for converting them into publicly traded joint stock companies, 
one should especially note the Uralruda Production Mining 
Association, the Mikaylovsk Mining Ore Dressing Complex, the 
Cherepovets Integrated Iron and Steel Works, the Berezniki 
Titanium-Magnesium Works, the Achinsk Alumina Combine, the 
Khrustalnyy Mining Ore Dressing Works, the Pervouralsk Tube 
Making, Chelyabinsk Tube Rolling, and Uralsk and Irkutsk 
Aluminum Plants, the Krasnyy Vyborzhets Leningrad Production 
Association for Nonferrous Metal Treatment, and others. 
  A number of metallurgical enterprises has been privatized 
and 
registered in appropriate bodies and are carrying out productive 
and economic activity in the framework of a publicly traded 
joint stock company (the Tulachermet Scientific Production 
Association, the Verkh-Isetskiy Metallurgical Plant, the 
Kandalaksha Aluminum Smeltery, the Domodedovo Refractory Plant, 
and the Solnechnogorsk Metallurgical Screen Plant). 
  We should note that the preliminary technical and economic 
analyses and subsequent feasibility studies and timely and 
proper preparation of founding documents for privatization at 
most of these enterprises were carried out with the help of the 
Central Scientific Research Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy, 
Central Scientific Research Institute of Nonferrous Metallurgy 
Economics and Information, Center for Scientific Organization of 
Labor in Nonferrous Metallurgy, and other scientific research 
organizations. 
  Yet for a number of reasons, particularly due to the absence 
of the necessary regulatory documents, e.g., statutes of 
enterprise employee stock funds (FARP), the procedure for 
transferring blocks of shares to trusts, the rate of land taxes, 
mineral use taxes, etc., privatization documents submitted on 
time for consideration and approval by the majority of 
enterprises are being considered past the deadlines established 
by the presidential decree. 
  The unsolved problems in the banking and credit system and 
the delinquency in payments for supplier products have largely 
prevented timely preparation of documents for transforming 
enterprises into joint stock companies. 
  The abnormal situation which has developed due to nonpayment 
at mining and metallurgical enterprises and the forthcoming 
surge in the injection of money due to the energy resource price 
liberalization will call for urgently addressing the issues of 
replenishing the working capital, indexing the cost of property, 
eliminating the cash deficit at the enterprises, expanding the 
checking and noncash transactions, accelerating the interbank 
clearing, and increasing the responsibility of the banks which, 
in contrast to enterprises, are successfully functioning and 
flourishing in their financial and economic activity. 
  A classification of metallurgical complex enterprises 
according to the possibility of their privatization in 1992 
pursuant to the state privatization program demonstrates that 
most of these enterprises (about 67%) must be privatized 
in 
coordination with local property management committees. The 
remaining enterprises (except for those which have already been 
transformed into joint stock companies) must be privatized in 
coordination with the Russian Federation State Committee on 
Property (20%) and Russian Federation government 
(12%). 
  The experience of local property management bodies 
considering the privatization documents submitted by enterprises 
attests that the privatization committees set up within these 
bodies are physically incapable of properly and in a timely 
fashion considering and coordinating the large volume of 
articles of incorporation and take into account the industrial, 
production-technical, and socioeconomic characteristics of the 
enterprise activity. 
  The fact that authoritative bodies represented by the 
Metallurgical Industry Department (today--Russian Federation 
Committee on Metallurgy), namely such structures as concerns, 
companies, associations, joint stock companies, and scientific 
research institutes have been virtually prevented from 
developing the organizational-technical and economic measures to 
transform state enterprises into joint stock companies, is a 
serious drawback in managing the privatization efforts. 
  As a result, the privatization plans being developed by the 
enterprises themselves do not include the most important 
measures aimed at increasing the operating efficiency of the 
enterprises and developing incentives for a production volume 
stabilization and increase and for a stable financial position, 
i.e., enterprise transformation into joint stock companies and 
privatization become an end in itself. 
  An analysis of enterprise privatization efforts in the 
industry shows that the enterprises which possess sufficient 
resources to set up a privatization fund and which have formed 
this fund in a timely fashion and introduced personal 
privatization accounts for employees are the ones that prepared 
and submitted privatization documents on time and selected 
benefits version, II which is the most profitable and acceptable 
to the employees. 
  From the total number of enterprises prepared for 
transformation into joint stock companies, almost three-quarters 
selected benefits version II which ensures redemption of 
51% of 
the entire block of shares and makes it possible to guarantee 
the controlling block of shares for the enterprise. Highly 
profitable aluminum production enterprises, tube mills, and 
nonferrous metal processing plants are dominant in this group of 
enterprises. 
  At privatized enterprises with marginal profitability and 
limited resources to set up sufficient privatization funds 
ensuring redemption of the controlling block of shares, 
22% of 
employee groups selected version I benefits. This version was 
selected by employees of the Mikhaylovsk and Lovozerskiy Mining 
Ore Dressing Combines, the Northern Onega Mine, the Ufaleynikel 
Production Association, Berezniki Titanium-Magnesium Works, 
Verkh-Isetskiy Metallurgical Plant, and others. 
  Only the employees at individual small enterprises (the 
Novosibirsk Rare Metals Plant and the Krasnoyarsk Vtortsvetmet 
Secondary Nonferrous Metals State Enterprise) selected benefits 
version III which provides for giving a small group of 
enterprise employees (under certain contractual conditions) the 
right and possibilities to carry out the privatization plan. 
  Several employee groups which leased the property of small 
state enterprises expressed the desire to convert to a limited 
liability partnership and buy it out. 
  For most of the remaining metallurgical complex enterprises, 
the conditions of their transformation into joint stock 
companies provided by the state privatization program do not 
enable the employees to buy out a large proportion of state 
property shares since, on the one hand, the enterprises do not 
possess a sufficient privatization fund formed primarily due to 
a surplus of economic incentive funds and after-tax profits, 
while on the other--employees at the enterprises selecting 
benefits version I are limited to 20 minimum monthly wages in 
the case of a gratuitous transfer of a part of preferred shares 
and when selling regular shares at a discount--to 6 minimum 
monthly wages per employee. 
  The option of purchasing 51% of shares is virtually 
unrealistic for large metallurgical enterprises with the high 
cost of capital stock since the selling price of such shares in 
accordance with the statutes of closed subscription of shares 
under state and municipal enterprise privatization approved by 
the Russian Federation State Committee on Property increases by 
a factor of 1.7. 
  The fact that the privatization program does not call for 
the 
possibility of privatized enterprise share redemption at par 
value by juridical persons whose share of state property exceeds 
25% decreases the activity and efficacy of the program and 
makes it impossible to involve the suppliers and consumers 
closely related by cooperative deliveries in redeeming the 
shares of the entities they are interested in. 
  The experience of enterprise privatization plan development 
with respect to searching for the resources to redeem shares 
demonstrates that most enterprises have forwarded to the 
privatization fund resources from their profits at the expense 
of other important profit utilization applications. As a result, 
financing of social programs and investments for the development 
of production and new equipment has been sharply reduced or 
terminated at these enterprises altogether. 
  We should note that to a certain extent, the Russian 
Federation Presidential Decree ``On Developing the System of 
Privatization Vouchers in the Russian Federation'' published in 
October 1992 solves this problem; it stipulates that in selling 
the privatized enterprise stock, the total number of shares to 
be sold for privatization vouchers to the joint stock companies 
developed in the course of privatization by converting state 
enterprises which are a property of the Russian Federation is 
equal to 80% and for enterprises which are a property of 
the 
constituent republics within the Russian Federation--35% 
of the 
total number of ordinary and type B preferred shares. Moreover, 
pursuant to the resolution of these republics' supreme councils, 
the total number of shares to be sold for privatization vouchers 
may be increased to 80%. This measures makes it possible 
considerably to expand the privatization scale if the 
enterprises do not have sufficient resources to set up 
privatization funds, reduce the use of profits for these 
purposes, and direct profits to social needs and production 
development. 
  A number of unsolved problems which lower the employee 
incentive to accelerate privatization has been revealed in the 
course of assessing the capital stock cost at mining, ore 
dressing, and mining and metallurgical enterprises in order to 
determine their authorized capital. 
  An important characteristic of property formation in this 
group of enterprises is the considerable proportion of the 
exploratory, capital, and preparatory operations in mining in 
the cost of capital stock. This is a peculiar type of property, 
and it does not appear possible either to sell it or use it for 
other purposes in the subsequent period since this property is 
subject to liquidation and write-off after a certain time (as 
the deposit is being depleted). 
  Consequently, it appears necessary to subtract the cost of 
this peculiar property in determining the authorized capital in 
order to accelerate the development of joint stock companies on 
the basis of marginally profitable mining extracting enterprises 
and providing an even playing field for them among other 
enterprises. 
  It is also necessary to subtract from the authorized capital 
the cost of environmental protection installations which is 
reflected in the cost of fixed capital since maintenance of 
these facilities involves considerable outlays yet does not 
guarantee profits while not only the enterprise employees, but 
also the entire population of the region derive benefit from 
their operation. 
  The aforementioned facilities must be transferred to the 
balance sheet of joint stock companies without compensation 
under an appropriate agreement. 
  The issues related to increasing the competitiveness of 
metal 
products in the external market, expanding the enterprises' 
export possibilities, developing production of scarce import 
substituting products, developing an ore and raw material base 
for stabilizing the enterprise operation, and creating new 
technologies and equipment which have been completely ignored in 
the enterprise privatization plans are especially acute at the 
privatized enterprises of the metallurgical complex. 
  At the stage of enterprise conversion to joint stock 
companies, it is necessary to develop special programs (business 
plans) to implement these high-priority trends and set up the 
sources and volumes of their financing, including the method of 
setting up subsidiary joint stock companies. 
  Holding companies as well as trust companies which possess 
blocks of stock (a share) which belong to the government and 
carry out these necessary investments in order to implement 
these programs due to the dividends derived from these shares 
could become the institutional management framework for the 
corresponding programs in various subindustries. Business plans 
must become part and parcel of enterprise privatization plans 
and should be considered and approved by the Russian Federation 
Government and State Committee on Property and by appropriate 
property management committees. 
  Conversion of large metallurgical complex enterprises into 
joint stock companies requires time, serious preparation, and an 
accounting of the characteristic features of the industries, the 
character of operations, and the outlook for the technical and 
economic development of each enterprise.

Engineering Academy] 
  [Text] The history of Russian light alloy metallurgy which 
served as the basis for subsequent formation of the aerospace 
technology in the former USSR dates back to the commissioning of 
the first specialized aluminum rolled stock mill 60 years ago. 
  The birth and constant dynamic development of aviation 
engineering in the 1930s were inextricably linked to 
improvements in the equipment and practices of casting ingots, 
manufacturing various types of metallurgical semifinished 
products, developing alloys, and expanding their applications in 
the aircraft industry. 
  Aviation metallurgy achieved tremendous success during the 
Great Patriotic War when an industrial base was created in the 
shortest time in the eastern part of the country, complex 
methods of manufacturing high-quality metal products were 
implemented at new plants, and scientific research work aimed at 
increasing aircraft ``survivability'' and improving their flight 
performance was carried out. 
  The use of light alloys in space technology, shipbuilding, 
and other areas of new technologies on a wider scale began in 
the postwar years. As a result, aviation metallurgy is becoming 
specialty metallurgy of light alloys and 
organizationally--subordinated to the USSR Ministry of Aviation 
Industry as a metallurgical department; at present, it is a part 
of the Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy. 
  The following landmarks characterize the postwar development 
of specialty metallurgy: 

  -  mastering continuous casting of aluminum alloy ingots and 
subsequently improving it by introducing vacuum melt treatment 
using electromagnetic molds, group casting, etc.; 
  -  developing and bringing on stream high-output vertical 
hydraulic presses with an up to 750 MN force for producing 
large-size stampings as well as horizontal presses with an up to 
200 MN force and mastering on their basis production of large 
extruded sections and panels 
  -  developing and mastering multistand hot and cold rolling 
mills 
which ensure production of a broad assortment of slabs, sheets, 
and bands for aircraft manufacturing and for other engineering 
fields; 
  -  mastering and implementing titanium, high-temperature, and 
refractory alloys and new melting methods (vacuum arc, electron 
beam, and electroslag remelting) which make it possible to 
produce alloys with a higher doping level in order to increase 
the strength, heat resistance, and other properties of materials; 
  -  producing high-temperature nickel, titanium, and aluminum 
alloys by the granular metallurgy method based on utilizing 
rapid solidification and hot isostatic pressing and production 
of billets by the methods of powder metallurgy, isothermal 
stamping, diffusion welding, etc. 
  -  Specialty metallurgy made a significant contribution to 
solving 
complex problems related to the development of modern aviation 
equipment at a high scientific and engineering level: these are 
the Buran spacecraft, the Mriya AN-225 aircraft with the highest 
load lifting capacity in the world, the comfortable civilian 
aircraft IL-96-300, TU-204, and IL-114, the newest military 
aircraft MIG-31, MIG-29, and SU-27, the Ka-32 and Mi-26 
helicopters, highly efficient PS-90 and TV7-117 engines, support 
aircraft, and other flying vehicles which are equal to the best 
developments in the world. 

    Today, specialty and light alloy metallurgy in industrially 
developed countries occupies one of the leading spots in various 
types of rolled stock production. The assortment of semifinished 
products produced has been expanded considerably, production of 
especially large deformed products has been mastered, and the 
quality indicators have been improved substantially. 
Semifinished products from nickel-based alloys, refractory 
metals, and aluminum-lithium alloys have been mastered and 
implemented extensively. 
  A stable ratio has developed--40% of light alloy 
blanks are 
used in aviation and specialty technologies and 60%--in 
the 
national economy. This subindustry production largely determines 
the possibilities of engineering progress in the production of 
computer equipment, electronics, radio engineering, nuclear 
power, construction, production of containers and packaging, and 
other branches of the national economy. 
  In Russia, virtually all structural rolled stock from 
aluminum, titanium, and a number of specialty alloys is produced 
at eight specialty metallurgy plants: the SMK, SaMZ, KUMPO, 
BKMPO, VSMPO, KMPP, KraMZ, and VILS. 
  Specialty metallurgy is characterized in that it represents 
a 
through technological production cycle--from smelting ingots to 
developing ready products (including those with a high degree of 
precision) for subsequent use in the mechanical engineering 
complex. High-production processes which ensure production of 
billets from light alloys of the requisite quality have been 
implemented at all production stages. 
  The principal types of rolled stock are large-size slabs and 
sheets from high- strength thermally hardened aluminum alloys. 
This rolled stock makes it possible to reduce the number of 
fastening joints in the structure thus considerably decreasing 
the product mass. 
  Today, new practices have been developed for hot and cold 
rolling of slabs and sheets with a variable cross section along 
the length whose macro- and microstructure and mechanical 
properties correspond to the sheets and slabs with a constant 
cross section in the same shipping condition. 
  Sheets and bands with a textured surface and decorative 
pattern are produced at specialty metallurgy plants, and 
production of thin aluminum bands with embossed relief for new 
structures of refrigerator and conditioner evaporators has been 
assimilated. Sheets with an isotropic surface roughness are 
being produced in order to improve the stamping ability and 
adhesion resistance as well as to upgrade the outside appearance 
of paint and varnish coats (primarily in the automotive 
industry). 
  In the 1970s, sheet rolling production at the Samara 
metallurgical plant was radically restructured. By upgrading the 
hot rolling mill and installing two imported high-speed cold 
rolling mills as well as a continuous heat treatment production 
line, the capacity of the rolling shop producing sheets and 
slabs from aluminum alloys increased by 2.5 times. During the 
overhaul, large-scale production of anodized tin can band was 
set up for the first time in our country. 
  Subsequent upgrading of the seven-stand hot rolling mill 
2800 
in the 1980s made it possible to increase the hot rolled coil 
mass from 6 to 10 t and reduce the semifinished rolled stock 
thickness from 6 to 3 mm, thus making it possible to increase 
the productivity of modern high-speed cold rolling mills 1800 
and 2300 and improve the rolled stock precision. 
  Today, a sheet rolling complex on the basis of a modern 
8-stand hot rolling mill is being assembled at the Krasnoyarsk 
metallurgical plant. The specialized equipment complex makes it 
possible to produce large slabs from aluminum alloys with a 
width of up to 2.7 and a length of up to 30 m. A unique 
hardening unit with controlled jet cooling produced by the Ebner 
Company ensures a high quality of slab and plate heat treatment. 
  Production of laminated sheets and slabs (including those 
from dissimilar materials) as well as rolled-welded panels from 
aluminum alloys has been set up at Russia's plants. The use of 
laminated rolled stock in various fields of mechanical 
engineering (in aerospace technology, shipbuilding, and rocket 
building) makes it possible to use principally new structural 
designs, lower the aircraft and spacecraft mass, increase the 
service life characteristics, and save scarce materials. 
  Aluminum alloy sheets and slabs plated with stainless steel 
have been successfully used both as structural materials for 
making vacuum-tight adaptors for welding products consisting of 
dissimilar materials, for making containers and vessels intended 
for storing corrosive liquids and biological products in 
agriculture, and for producing clad metal kitchen utensils. 
  Aluminum alloy sheets and slabs plated with copper on one or 
both sides are used for making current conducting electrical 
equipment, current leads, contactors, and circuit breakers, and 
repeater and radar systems; in household appliances, this 
ensures a high operating reliability and saves scarce copper. 
  Rolled welded panels and thermal plates from aluminum and 
its 
alloys are used in heat exchange systems for developing 
household refrigerators, heat and pressure chambers, and life 
support systems and for making solar water heaters. 
  One hundred and eighty extrusion complexes and production 
lines on the basis of horizontal hydraulic presses with a force 
from 5 to 200 MN are in operation in rolling mills of specialty 
metallurgy plants. They are used to produce more than 20,000 
types of sections from aluminum alloys. 
  Commercial production of thin-walled panels with a 960-2,100 
mm width and an up to 12 m length from aluminum (including 
aluminum-lithium) alloys on the basis of presses with a force of 
50-80-120 and 200 MN has been underway for 25 years. This unique 
technology is based on extruding finned pipe and subsequently 
uncoiling it into a plane on special dressing equipment. 
  The domestic industry is producing hot-extruded, 
cold-strained, and welded pipes. In addition to making regular 
round pipes, finned, rectangular, and oval-shaped pipes are also 
produced. A method has been developed and specialized production 
line equipment for making drilling pipes has been manufactured. 
  In recent years, highly efficient methods of producing 
seamless tubes from aluminum alloys with an inside 
corrosion-resistant coating has been developed in Russia in 
recent years. Methods of making wound grain storage structures 
have been developed. 
  Large-size stamped blanks (with a broad assortment) from 
aluminum alloys are produced in vertical hydraulic stamping 
presses with a force from 50 to 750 MN. Spars, beams, arm props, 
chassis frames, etc., are being produced with a minimum 
machining allowance. 
  Rolled large-size rings should be mentioned among large-size 
semifinished products. 
  A technology of stamping piston-type parts from alloy AK12D 
containing 12-14% Si has been developed at specialty 
metallurgy 
plants. Full-scale tests demonstrate that their wear resistance 
increased by fivefold while their service life was extended by 
approximately twofold. 
  Such branches as the aviation industry, shipbuilding, 
general 
mechanical engineering, chemical and petroleum machinebuilding, 
and metallurgy have a need for titanium rolled stock. 
  Russia's titanium production set up at the VSMPO possesses 
the largest smelting capacities in the world for making ingots. 
With respect to the equipment range and capabilities and ingot 
production, the smelting industry exceeds all other countries 
taken together (120,000 t/yr). Cylindrical ingots with a 
280-1,200 mm diameter and an up to 15 t mass are smelted. Double 
and triple vacuum arc remelting technologies have been 
implemented in production thus ensuring a high metal quality. 
The autocrucible melting process which ensures chemical 
homogeneity of titanium alloys and the possibility of utilizing 
(up to 100%) waste and returning it back to the melt 
without 
preliminary grinding has been commercially implemented at the 
VSMPO. 
  Existing production of deformed semifinished products from 
titanium and its alloys carried out at the VSMPO, VILS, KMPP, 
ChMZ, SMK, and other enterprises ensures a diverse assortment of 
semifinished products from a wide range of alloys. 
  Methods of extruding titanium alloys and steels which 
provided for overhauling existing hydraulic presses, heating 
devices, and straightening tensile machines which have been used 
before for making aluminum alloy sections was developed in the 
mid-1960s for ensuring production of sections for engine frames. 
  Production of thin-walled sections with a minimum 1.5 mm 
wall 
thickness and with a surface quality which made it possible to 
weld them without additional machining was set up in the early 
70s. A coil method of making 0.2-0.8 mm thick sheets from 
titanium alloys with a mass of 2 t has been mastered at the 
VSMPO. 
  Due to the breakup of the USSR, Russia, being a dominant 
consumer of titanium and its alloys, was left without its own 
operating sources of titanium ore raw material or existing 
production of alloying composition and has only a 40-45% 
(of 
the demand) capacity for titanium sponge production. 
  In the near future, the issues of supplying Russia's 
titanium 
industry with its own raw material, improving the rolled stock 
and blank quality to the level of world standards, creating 
conditions for more economic metal utilization at all process 
stages, supplying all branches of the national economy with the 
full range of semifinished products and blanks, and ensuring 
access to the world market for Russia's titanium production must 
be solved comprehensively in the near future. 
  The scientists working in specialty metallurgy mastered for 
the first time in the 1960s vacuum arc melting of refractory 
nickel alloys which subsequently was implemented at all ferrous 
metallurgy plants. This made it possible considerably to improve 
the metal purity. Extensive research into using electron beam 
smelting has been carried out in order to improve the refractory 
alloy ingot quality further. Work is underway on manufacturing 
equipment and developing methods of continuous ingot casting 
using intermediate foundry ladles and separating the metal 
melting and solidification processes. 
  Yet nickel alloy blanks produced by traditional methods no 
longer meet the increasing requirements of high-temperature 
strength. Granular metallurgy which was borne at the VILS in the 
1970s made it possible to ensure the properties of compact 
blanks at the level of deformed metal properties or better and 
thus eliminate deformation in a number of cases and produce 
blanks with a high shape complexity and dimensional accuracy, 
ensure a radical improvement in properties, and manufacture 
principally new types of blanks (with a variable chemical 
composition) and combined parts (discs with blades, impellers, 
etc.) whose production is impossible by traditional metallurgy 
methods. 
  Various types of specialized domestic equipment have been 
developed for producing granules by the centrifugal electrode 
sputtering methods and their processing and degassing, as well 
as gasostats and equipment for subsequent processing and 
monitoring of ready parts. A shop for producing granular 
metallurgy products from refractory nickel alloys, particularly 
discs and shafts for mass-produced aviation engines, has been 
constructed and brought onstream. The RD-33 for MIG-29s are 
equipped with discs and shafts produced by granular metallurgy 
methods. Today, increasing the reliability of discs for modern 
turbojet engines PS-90 and TV7-117 and passenger airliners 
IL-96- 300, TU-204, and IL-114 is a high-priority task. 
  Development of modern aviation and specialty equipment calls 
for creating new materials with a low density which have high 
service characteristics. Traditional foundry and powder 
metallurgy methods have virtually exhausted their capabilities 
of increasing the properties of materials. In recent years, 
extensive developments of materials using a principally new 
method-- mechanical alloying--which differs in that all alloy 
formation processes occur in the solid phase have been underway 
at the VILS in recent years. This makes it possible to produce 
materials with a unique combination of physical and mechanical 
properties which are unattainable by other methods. 
  Assimilation of high-modulus aluminum-based materials for 
instruments and their components whose use will make it possible 
to lower the instrument mass by two- to fivefold and increase 
the instrument reliability and accuracy and high-temperature and 
heat resistance iron and nickel alloys for combustion chambers, 
heat protection screens, nozzles, heat exchangers for high- 
temperature structural fastening elements, etc., is underway. 
This will make it possible to increase the operating temperature 
of gas turbine engines by 100-150C made from age-hardened 
titanium alloys with an elevated wear resistance. Materials on 
the basis of intermetallic compounds with a reduced density and 
elevated corrosion resistance are being developed for 
substituting high-temperature nickel alloys in making gas 
turbine engine blades. 
  In recent years, work has been underway on producing new 
alloys by utilizing the vacuum deposition processes. The 
possibility of producing aluminum alloys with an elevated 
high-temperature strength for use in structural elements in 
place of titanium alloys and steels is confirmed. 
  Composite materials with a metallic and ceramic matrix have 
been generating considerable interest. Aluminum composite 
materials with a discrete reinforcing agent are promising for 
ensuring a low part mass combined with a high strength and 
rigidity and good wear resistance. Thus, the specific rigidity 
of Al-SiC materials is 1.5-2 times higher than that of 
conventional structural alloys (steel and titanium and aluminum 
alloys) while their specific strength is comparable to that of 
titanium alloys and considerably exceeds high-strength steels. 
  The solution to the problem of producing materials ensuring 
operation of structures at a 1,500-1,800C is closely 
related to utilizing composites with a ceramic or intermetallic 
matrix. Composites on the basis of silicon nitride and carbide 
which are characterized in that they combine high strength and 
heat conductivity with low specific gravity and coefficient of 
thermal expansion are the most promising. The use of hot 
isostatic pressing makes it possible to produce highly dense 
blanks with a complex shape with a small finishing machining 
allowance and with isotropic physical and chemical properties. 
  The accumulated experience of producing metallurgical 
semifinished products for the defense complex must be actively 
implemented under today's conditions for producing civilian 
items. It is necessary to maintain the scientific and technical 
potential of specialty metallurgy, support and promote 
scientific developments, and lay the foundation for stable 
performance of the industry in an environmental of world market 
competition. 
  Due to a reform of economic management methods in Russia 
under today's conditions and the need to merge with the 
economies of the world community, there is an urgent issue of 
ensuring that the metallurgical enterprises manufacture 
competitive products which meet customer requirements. An 
infrastructure for testing and certifying semifinished made from 
light and specialty alloys in conformance with series 9000 ISO 
international standard requirements must be developed for 
ensuring the high competitiveness of the metallurgical products. 
Setting up certification efforts will enable the metallurgical 
plants to ensure high-quality product shipments to domestic 
plants and earn a reputation of suppliers of high-quality 
products among foreign partners.

All-Russia Light Alloys Institute; UDC 69.717] 
  [Text] Compared to iron, steel, copper, brass, wood, and 
glass, aluminum as a structural material is relatively young 
since it has been produced for a little over 100 years. Yet 
nevertheless, due to the considerable diversity of its 
properties, aluminum now substitutes these materials and even 
has certain advantages over them. No other material is known 
which would be represented in such diverse forms, e.g., sheet 
and plate rolled stock, plates (slabs), foil (with a thickness 
up to 5m, sections, forged products, shaped cast products, 
wire, and powder. 
  A unique combination of the most diverse aluminum properties 
makes it possible to use it efficiently in various branches of 
the national economy, primarily such large sectors as the 
automotive engineering industry, construction, container and 
packaging production, electrical engineering, agriculture, etc. 
  Noticeable successes in the development of materials, 
practices, and structures and their optimum utilization have 
been achieved in these particular applications. Let us consider 
several examples. 
  The most important issue for Russia is to solve the food 
problem, primarily the tasks of harvesting, storing, and 
transporting grain since its poor organization leads to losses 
of up to 30% or more. The solution used widely in world 
practices is to develop a system of metallic mechanized grain 
storage facilities which can be rapidly erected and positioned 
in direct proximity to the food production locations. The 
construction cycle of one elevator tower with a 250 t capacity 
in the field is 24 h while a "turnkey" mechanized complex with a 
1,000 t capacity can be completed in 30 days. 
  A structure has been set up which will make it possible 
annually to construct in Russia storage facilities for 2 million 
tons of grain. This will require 25,000 t of aluminum rolled 
products. 
  A large number of other efficient aluminum building 
structures for agricultural purposes which are characterized by 
a high degree of plant finish (chicken coops, greenhouses, 
potato storage, irrigation pipes for irrigated farming, etc.) as 
well as agricultural transport structures (refrigerators, truck 
trays for transporting fertilizer, milk tanks, etc.) has been 
developed. 
  The development of production of canning band as an integral 
component of a complex of efforts aimed to set up production of 
rolled sheets was a considerable achievement. Scientific 
principles and production methods have been developed and a 
large volume of design efforts has been carried out; large-scale 
production with a capacity of up to 75,000 t/yr of band has been 
set up at the SaMZ; together with the Dmitrov pilot plant, it 
produces approximately 90,000 t/yr which amounts to 30% of 
container production in the country. Yet, e.g., compared to the 
United States, per capita consumption of aluminum rolled 
products for packaging food is 15 times lower. 
  Another promising application of aluminum is in light motor 
transport (safety beams from aluminum sections with a high 
damping ability and even entire bodies including the reinforcing 
elements and the skin, pistons for highly stressed sports car 
engines from gasostat-treated powder alloys, and reliable 
superlight stamped wheel discs manufactured by aviation 
engineering methods). 
  Aluminum consumption in Russia's motor transport may reach 
300,000 t/yr. The energy outlays for the production of aluminum 
used will be quickly recovered due to fuel savings. 
  Aluminum has found successful applications in making 
railroad 
car axle boxes because of its ability to decrease their mass by 
twofold and lower the dynamic loads on the rails and car 
structures by 10% due to aluminum's damping properties. 
Furthermore, aluminum journal boxes require virtually no repairs 
during their entire service life. Up to 8,000 t of aluminum have 
been used annually for making the axle boxes since 1982. 
  Today, conversion made it possible to utilize in car 
structures large-size panels from aluminum alloys with an up to 
800 mm width and a length equal to that of the entire car, 
aluminum alloy pipes with inside corrosion-resistant cladding 
for water supply and heating systems, and slabs from weldable 
alloys for making railroad tank cars for acids. 
  The development of both today's comfortable high-speed 
railroad cars and subway cars would be impossible without 
extensive utilization of aluminum. 
  In recent decades, aluminum has been widely used in 
construction both as load carrying and barrier structures in the 
building interior and exterior. 
  Our designers and researchers have developed not only 
barrier 
structures but also three-dimensional load-carrying structures 
of building spans spanning 18, 21, and 84 m. 
  With respect to the foregoing, we should mention that a 
completely abnormal situation has developed in the country in 
the field of structural aluminum section production, primarily 
for making building structures. The ratio of extruded products 
to the total volume of commercial rolled stock from aluminum 
alloys has remained virtually unchanged in the past decade and 
amounts to close to 12%. Generally, the ratio of aluminum 
use 
in construction in the most developed countries, such as Japan, 
has settled at a 30% level, in Italy, at approximately 
20%, 
whereas in Russia, no more than 7% of all aluminum rolled 
products made is used in construction. 
  All of the roughly 120,000 t of section production is 
concentrated at six large aviation metallurgy plants and five 
specialized plants where two-to-five presses are in operation. 
Altogether, there are approximately 140 press production lines 
and complexes in the country, including 112 in aviation 
metallurgy. At the same time, approximately 1 million tons of 
sections in the United States is produced at 250 small 
specialized plants utilizing 450 press units. 
  The need to develop in the next 10-15 years a network of 
small plants producing aluminum sections at a rate of only 
200-250,000 t/yr and putting in operation a minimum of 50-60 
modern press production lines is obvious. In order to support 
the aforementioned billet production with the requisite metal 
quality, it is necessary to set up ingot smelting at primary 
aluminum plants, i.e., columns with a 130-250 mm diameter from 
alloys 6005, 6060, and 6063 with proper filtering, inoculation, 
and diffusion annealing. 
  Recently, the issue of broader utilization of aluminum in 
the 
petroleum and gas complex has been raised at an increasing 
frequency. We have developed considerable pipe production both 
for exploration and commercial drilling. Nineteen thousand tons 
of these pipes are being produced. 
  Due to the high sulfide compound concentration in petroleum 
in Orenburg area wells, steel pipes with double thick walls have 
been used, yet this does not solve the problem since the pipes 
have to be changed anyway as corrosion progresses. At the same 
time, aluminum is resistant in a hydrogen sulfide medium and can 
compete in resistance with corrosion-resistant steel. The demand 
for petroleum and pumping and compressor pipes from aluminum 
alloys is estimated as 100,000 t/yr. 
  One can cite numerous other positive examples of aluminum 
applications in various types of equipment, processes, 
structures, and devices. 
  The high technical and economic efficiency of aluminum 
applications in various fields of engineering and 
investment-financed projects for developing primary metal and 
rolled stock production gave the users a reason to plan for a 
long- term expansion of its application volumes to up to 4.5 
million t/yr (1978 and 1983 forecasts). 
  A reduction in project financing volumes, the absence of a 
noticeable increase in primary aluminum production and, 
likewise, aluminum rolled products and its constant shortages, 
and allocation of rolled stock for individual applications based 
on the residual principle led to a decrease in the user 
"appetite" and, most importantly, pushed the time of planned 
increase in aluminum use to 2005 and 2010. We should also notice 
that the forecast was made based on 1989 orders, i.e., prior to 
the start of an escalating price increase for metals, energy, 
and other types of resources. 
  In real life, a drop in rolled stock production volume has 
been observed in the last three years. The reasons for this 
phenomenon are dual in origin. On the one hand, the principal 
management difficulties causing unstable plant operation are due 
to the lack of raw material supplies and disruption of economic 
relations. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-34A>           Fig. 1. Aluminum Rolled Stock Price Trend. </FIG>




  On the other hand, the consumers are moving away from using 
rolled stock, do not accept products already made to order, and 
return to old technologies and structures employing steel, cast 
iron, and other less expensive materials due to a sharp rise in 
aluminum rolled stock prices (Fig. 1) brought about by a 
multiple increase in prices for primary metals, energy, and 
other resources. In particular, such automotive enterprises as 
the KamAZ, MAZ, and OdAZ have ceased ordering extruded sections 
in the last two years while railroad workers are quickly 
restarting production of railroad car axle boxes from steel and 
pig iron. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UST-002LC-34B>           Fig. 2. Price Index of Individual Types of Structural and Building Materials. </FIG>




  If we compare thealuminum rolled product price index to that 
of steel, wood, or cement (Fig. 2), i.e., the materials which it 
effectively substitutes, one can see its considerable lead. For 
this reason, in the past two to three years, aluminum has 
catastrophically lost its position gained in previous years. 
  Process engineers, naturally, possess the reserves whose 
utilization will make it possible to decrease to a certain 
extent the rate of price increase for aluminum rolled stock; 
this is primarily a decrease in the energy outlays for its 
production. Enterprises of the former aviation metallurgy are 
heavy users of fuel and energy resources. In 1991, they consumed 
4 billion kWh of electric power, more than 1 billion 
m[.sup]3[/] of natural gas, and 13 million GJ of thermal 
energy. 
  The energy source price rise led to an increase in the ratio 
of energy outlays to the cost of production from 2.5 to 
10% 
while a further rise in the energy source price to the world 
level may boost the energy component of production costs to 
20%. Under such conditions, the role of energy 
conservation in 
the economic subenterprises changes radically. The reserves of 
energy resource conservation at enterprises are estimated to be 
at least 30%. Most of the largest operating energy 
consuming 
equipment is obsolete and has been greatly neglected while the 
energy consumption management level lags behind today's 
computerized planning and equipment operation control practices. 
  It is necessary to develop new combustion melting furnaces 
with a modern regenerative burner system and a high-speed flame 
and an automatic control system. 
  Utmost utilization of liquid aluminum from electrolyzers in 
smelting ingots in Krasnoyarsk and Kamensk-Uralsk may greatly 
lower energy outlays (up to 100 million rubles/yr). The 
power-to-output ratio for producing tin can band by using 
non-ingot blank rolling can be lowered by 25-30%. 
  The following should be substituted: obsolete traveling 
ovens 
for heating slabs--with modern pusher-tube furnaces at the 
Kamensk-Uralsk and Belaya Kalitva Metallurgical Production 
Associations and the Stupino Integrated Iron and Steel Works; 
the uneconomical and environmentally unacceptable saltpeter 
quenching baths at the Stupino Integrated Iron and Steel Works 
and Kamensk- Uralsk Metallurgical Production Association; and 
resistance furnaces--with gas-fired furnaces. 
  Due to the insufficient present level of investment, the use 
of secondary energy resources (VER) does not exceed 4% of 
the 
total output. Yet an increase in the secondary energy resource 
utilization by a mere 10% may lower the energy outlays by 
120 
million rubles/yr. 
  Another important reserve which is not adequately used today 
and which makes it possible under rising primary metal and 
energy resource prices to improve the situation with the use of 
aluminum in various industries is maximizing the involvement of 
secondary aluminum in production. In contrast to many other 
metals, the very nature of aluminum provides broad opportunities 
for its multiple use. Moreover, the energy outlays for its 
production amount to merely 5% of the primary production 
energy 
outlays. 
  Thus far, a lion's share of annually produced aluminum has 
been irretrievably lost from circulation and will not be 
returned in the form of recycled scrap until the end of the 
products' service life. The ratio of secondary aluminum to the 
total volume of its production in the country does not exceed 
18-20% while the rolled stock produced from secondary 
aluminum 
alloys amounts to merely 5% of the total volume. At the 
same 
time, the proportion of secondary aluminum in world practices 
reaches close to 25% (close to 38% in the United 
States and 
30% in Europe) and in individual developed countries, it 
exceeds 75% (79.1% in Japan in 1985). 
  The mining and alumina enterprises and primary aluminum 
production plants also have sufficient reserves and are faced 
with problems whose realization and solution may have a 
beneficial effect on increasing the technical level and lowering 
the cost of their production. 
  Yet when each enterprise individually addresses the 
aforementioned issues, both extracting and processing, most of 
the efficient large-scale measures cannot be implemented because 
they require considerable investment which an individual 
enterprise cannot afford. 
  At the same time, historically the aluminum-containing raw 
material mining (bauxites and nephelines) and alumina and 
primary aluminum production have been exclusively concentrated 
in nonferrous metallurgy while production of structural rolled 
stock from aluminum and its alloys (plates, sheets, bands, 
sections, panels, buses, rods, pipes, wire, stampings, and 
rings)--primarily at machining enterprises of the former USSR 
Ministry of Aviation Industry. 
  Thus, the issue of supplying the needs of the national 
economy with aluminum products has been thus far addressed by a 
large number of individual uncoordinated enterprises. 
  The three most important features can be identified among 
the 
many negative consequences of such lack of coordination. 

  -  Due to a rather frequent discrepancy between the 
departmental interests and natioal interests, the issue of 
stably supplying metalworking enterprises with primary metal has 
always been solved with great difficulties. As a result, the 
degree to which the national economy's need for aluminum rolled 
products are met has not exceeded 75-80%. 
  -  Under the conditions where state subsidies are severely 
limited 
and, at times, are not available altogether, and it is 
impossible to concentrate the financial resources for radically 
increasing the technical production level, each individual 
enterprise, as we have already indicated, is forced to limit its 
retooling plans in accordance with its own realistic 
possibilities. 
  -  Given the existing tax structure, only the added-value tax 
collected more than once due to the lack of enterprise 
coordination leads to a sharp increase in the aluminum rolled 
stock cost, a drop in demand, and a loss of positions already 
gained. 
  -  In our opinion, under today's conditions, these problems can 
be 
solved radically by deepening the vertical links and setting up 
unified commercial structures for manufacturing aluminum 
products, the so-called technological aluminum corporations. 
They are technological because they must unify enterprises which 
have long been connected by a common technological link which 
includes mining the ore raw material, processing it, producing 
primary metal, and manufacturing ready metallurgical production 
(rolled stock). 

    Prompt resolution of the issue of eliminating the 
bottlenecks, bringing the entire technological cycle to a proper 
technical level, ensuring stable operation of all links, and 
attaining high economic production indicators and total economic 
independence is possible only in the framework of sufficiently 
strong commercial structures and by concentrating intellectual, 
financial, and other sources.

  [Excerpts] The developed countries of the world are 
presently involved in the global exchange of materials, 
information, and specialists. The direction of the flow of high 
technology is decisive in this process. Theoretically, one can 
quantitatively measure the volume of these exchanges across 
national borders; however, practically speaking, the scale of 
the transmission of high technology in three such streams can be 
determined only qualitatively. For example, the influx of high 
technology from the West into Japan greatly exceeds the influx 
from Japan to the West, judging from some unsystematic data, for 
example, statistics on Japanese students and graduate students 
studying in the US and Europe or the exchange of scientists. 
  In essence, today's high technology is global, and one 
cannot 
avoid the aforementioned contacts. Especially interesting is the 
problem of systemization, classification, and analysis of the 
number and quality of specialists in high technology, the 
"generators" and bearers of this technology. 
  The success of Japan in developing high technology areas of 
industry and science, as well as the active positive role of the 
government in this process, have made Japan's experience 
important for the reform of science and industry in Russia. 
Thus, it is especially interesting to study Japanese specialists 
in high technology areas (primarily microelectronics, computing, 
etc.) as well as the scientists who provide for the development 
of these fields. An instrument, and at the same time, an object 
of study is the NAMES database, which includes the leading 
Japanese scientists, businessmen, and specialists in high 
technology. 
  The objects of study were: 1. analysis of the sources of 
information; 2. the method of selecting specialists for 
inclusion in the database; and 3. a quantitative estimate of the 
level of competence of the specialists (optimal number of 
parameters characterizing a specialist, elimination of the 
subjectivity of expert opinions, etc.). 
  [passage omitted] 
<H3>  Description of the NAMES database (``Who's who in the high 
technology of Japan'') </H3>
  The NAMES database is an automated information research 
system which includes a card file and specialized software based 
on the dBASE IV database management system with a list of 
classification headings. The database includes about 5000 names 
of Japanese scientists, engineers, and managers working in high 
technology fields such as computing, microelectronics, automated 
design and production, robotics, etc. A record in the database 
includes personal parameters (full name, presence or absence of 
name written in Japanese characters, address of employing 
organization, telephone, fax, etc.) as well as professional 
parameters (degree/title, post, area of scientific interests, 
patents, etc.). In addition to these fields there is also a text 
field for additional information. 
  A program module has been developed to calculate a 
generalized estimate of the level of competence, for which a 
special field is reserved. 
  Information in the card file has been collected since about 
1975. 
  In the future, NAMES will have a modular structure including 
thematic files (computers, semiconductors, robots, etc.), a 
patent file (patent abstracts, patent holders included in the 
database), a statistical module, and possibly an organizational 
file on the structure of organizations whose employees are 
included in the database. The database language is English, 
because the product is primarily oriented toward a Western 
market. Of course, as the situation in Russia improves it will 
be easy to adapt the database to the domestic market. 
  Specialists in the database may be grouped by firm, 
government scientific research institute, governmental 
department, professional society, association, or corporations 
of Japan. 
  At present the database does not require a knowledge of 
programming and enables one to work in the following modes: 
query by example, editing of records, editing of the screen, 
addition of new records, and printing of the current record. In 
query mode one can search the following fields in the record: 
name, organization, area of scientific interests, degree/title, 
and patents. 
  Additional database capabilities enable the user to join and 
sort data in different ways, to verify information, to organize 
interactive work modes, and to protect in formation. 
<H5>  Prospects for further development </H5>
  The world is involved in a constant battle for the 
possession 
of intellect and access to its sources. A consequence is a 
continuing migration of intellect across national borders, and 
this requires a practical estimate of the potential of the 
scientists and specialists of various countries. Here a database 
of the scientists and specialists of various countries can play 
an irreplaceable role. Such databases make it possible, with the 
appropriate depth of development and entries, to determine the 
number and level of competence of specialists in various fields 
of science and technology and detect trends and features of 
development, priorities, and goals in the scientific and 
technical progress of various countries. 
  Our NAMES database may be used as a prototype database for 
various countries, and is a useful instrument for researchers 
and private companies. It is also a methodological basis for the 
creation of similar database. Such databases have good 
commercial prospects, because the participation of high 
technology specialists is key in determining the success or 
failure of new firms. 
  In the Russian Academy of Sciences and in industry there are 
specialists from the countries of the Far East and Southeast 
Asia who may be drawn to the development of such databases, 
which would make it possible to solve another problem, that of 
the optimal use of scientists and specialists in our country. 
  We can use the existing methodological and factographic 
materials right now and fill the niche in the Western 
information market for a database of personal information on 
Japanese specialists in the area of high technology. According 
to our estimates this niche will remain empty for a maximum of 
2-3 years. The market for a database on Japanese specialists in 
areas of high technology in industry and science may attract 
thousands, even tens of thousands of users and may constitute a 
sum of several million dollars. 
  Our plan, given minimum financing, is to develop a 
full-scale 
relational database of personal information, programs for 
statistical analysis and quantitative evaluation of the level of 
competence of the specialist in interactive mode, independent of 
the contents of the database, as well as active sounding of the 
Western information market with advertisements and the formation 
of demand for such software products.

  [Text] Strictly speaking, Samorukov's area of 
responsibility at the Kvant Scientific Research Institute is 
supercomputer components. But who works strictly according to 
job description? Samorukov is also involved in LSI design and 
development and in the automation of LSI design. In other words, 
as Samorukov says, he takes what the logicians and experts in 
computer structure and architecture have developed, combines it, 
and pulls it through the physical implementation stage in such a 
way that the final prototype machine will operate reliably. 
  [Samorukov] The point is that in specifying the 
limiting characteristics of our computers, all these specialists 
frequently forget to take into account the fact that Kvant is 
not independently capable of implementing their designs in 
hardware using existing components. We have therefore been 
forced to approach collaborating enterprises in the electronics 
industry and order new components from them; otherwise, we could 
only dream of reaching the required level. However, these 
collaborators have their own requirements: We must not only 
develop a concept for a new machine and determine its 
characteristics, not only develop plans for it, but also put all 
of the ideas in a document of specific form; this document is 
then provided to the designers of the various individual 
units---to designers specializing in electric power, automation, 
etc. One person needs to be able to keep track of all this in 
his head. I am that person. 
  [KOMPYUTER MARKET] Is there any difference between 
what you worried about 10 or 15 years ago and what you worry 
about now? 
  [Samorukov] The situation is quite different now. 
Before, under strict centralized government control, Kvant and 
its products had high priority. We had both money and confirming 
directives---in essence, guarantees. We took these directives 
and hired collaborating enterprises. And we knew that this 
product would come in from this enterprise and that product 
would come in from that enterprise in accordance with 
established deadlines, so that we could count on being able to 
construct a new machine within the required time frame according 
to plan, debug it, build a mockup, and present it to the 
customer. 
  [KOMPYUTER MARKET] Weren't there failures under 
this system? 
  [Samorukov] Of course there were. Supplies were 
occasionally interrupted and development sometimes slowed down, 
but the system generally functioned. It enabled both us and our 
suppliers to plan. The customers had well-defined benchmarks 
good to plus or minus six months or a year. It was possible to 
project 5-10 years ahead with reasonable confidence. 
  The main customer for our high-production items has been the 
defense industry. And as soon as they began to have their 
budgets cut and started cutting back, the orders immediately 
stopped coming in, which left the Kvant Scientific Research 
Institute with much less financial maneuvering room. After all, 
the need for the equipment we produced was much smaller. 
Moreover, the flexibility of Kvant's supercomputer technology 
enables us to include 100 or even 1000 units in a single 
machine, while a commercial customer might be satisfied with a 
power of 10 or 20. It turns out that we are now working (to put 
it mildly) at far less than our full potential. Most 
``free-market'' entities are simply not in a position to use our 
class of technology or components. This leads to wheel-spinning 
and downtime. 
  [KOMPYUTER MARKET] Dead season? 
  [Samorukov] Half-dead. It is now clear that 
without government support, ``high technology'' enterprises such 
as ours previously oriented towards defense work will soon 
experience difficulties. And this is despite the fact that many 
problems in pure science requiring high-performance computers 
(such as meteorological forecasting and seismic research) are 
still of current interest and remain unsolved. There is 
virtually no government support. The US itself, with its 
extremely well-developed commercial sector which has trillions 
of dollars available to it, has traditional government 
investment in supercomputer programs, and the sums involved are 
enormous: Last year, in 1992, the American government subsidized 
a supercomputer and communications technology development 
program with 600 million dollars. This is equivalent to 600 
billion rubles. But our government has cast Kvant to the winds 
of fate and put us out to pasture to sink or swim. That's why 
we're going after any development projects at all, generally 
small projects completely inconsistent with the level of 
problems that the Kvant Scientific Research Institute is capable 
of working on. But what can we do? We are trying to keep our 
unique corps of specialists together and prevent them from 
running off to commercial or other enterprises capable of paying 
higher salaries than Kvant. 
  [KOMPYUTER MARKET] And are you succeeding? 
  [Samorukov] Yes, with difficulty. Many of the 
young people we had the most hope in have either already left or 
are thinking of leaving. We are only able to hold on to the 
older staff. After all, we stall have a budgetary limit on 
salaries. We even have to state this in [employment] agreements. 
Only very recently have we been able to talk about indexing 
salaries or graduated financing. To put it another way, it is 
completely impossible for us to provide our staff with the same 
standard of living that we could about ten years ago. The 
problem of how to keep the Kvant staff in some sort of suspended 
animation until our products are indeed needed by the country as 
a whole (and not just a limited segment) will therefore be 
difficult to solve. Moreover, we are now unable to invest in 
development as we have for many years. All of the money received 
by the Kvant Scientific Research Institute is now being eaten.

YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA introduction.] 
  [Text] Computer piracy in Russia is a widespread 
phenomenon. The world average ratio of stolen (that is, 
illegally copied) to purchased software is about 1:3; in Russia 
it is 999:1. 
  Russia is computerizing rapidly. No self-respecting firm can 
do without a computer, and frequently blue monitor screens glow 
even in the windows of private residences. But virtually every 
common citizen, knowing how expensive the computer itself is, 
perceives computer programs as some sort of free supplement to 
the machine itself, as if they were empty diskettes. There are 
few who realize that computer programs frequently cost much more 
than the computers themselves. 
  All Russians, whom fate has somehow granted a computer, are 
in one way or another connected with the main global computer 
problem of piracy (or, scientifically speaking, bootlegging). 
Almost all software products used today in Russia are stolen, 
that is, not purchased from an official dealer of the producer, 
or copied without the producer's knowledge and consent. Every 
year, computer firms suffer multimillion, even billion dollar 
losses from illegal copying. The majority of Russians who are 
associated in one way or another with computer equipment engage 
continuously in piracy. Don't put on a concerned face...it's you 
too. Turn on your computer and look at the hard disk directory: 
did you buy many of the programs there officially? Or for 
example, yesterday you presented your friend with a diskette 
with the latest Aidstest; did you pay for it, or did you copy 
it yourself? It's not even important that you didn't profit from 
this. Piracy is any use of one copy of purchased software by 
more than one user simultaneously. In civilized countries this 
is a crime with a rather severe punishment. We have these laws 
too, but they are universally ignored, because the process is 
uncontrollable. 
  You must understand that I'm not complaining a lot about 
this 
yet. World prices for software are intended for the world, and 
not for us. Although prices are still somewhat lower here, not 
everyone can bring himself to pay the equivalent of 400 dollars 
for the latest version of Corel Draw when he can simply get it 
from his friends. Thus, the real prohibition of computer piracy 
will be equivalent to prohibiting computers in general, and this 
means our hopelessly lagging country will again have to go back 
to the drawing board. 
  Despite the fact that Russia is firmly in first place in the 
world in the number of illegal copies and the ratio of stolen to 
purchased software, we are still far from understanding what 
true piracy is. We are as far from it as the pirates of the 
eighteenth century are from today's pirates. Today there are 
entire pirate companies with the same scope as computer 
companies, but which do not advertise. They fill the market with 
their products, which have a quality approaching the quality of 
the true product. The bootlegs (illegal copies) are sold in 
large software stores, in packaging with documentation, in a 
completely official-looking form. These companies are mainly in 
the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe, which now seem 
to specialize in the production of illegal goods, from imitation 
``German'' liquors to, as you can see, computer programs. 
However, these firms also exist in the West. For example, 
recently, illegal copies of a remarkable game, Formula One Grand 
Prix, and Oxford Chess by MicroProse were demonstrated to me. 
They had been brought from England and everything was in order, 
from the ``official'' diskettes to the documentation... 
  These programs are mainly bought by our countrymen because, 
first, they are cheaper than the r eal thing, and second, 
because few Russians have seen the original packaging of the 
computer game. To those people who want to know how to 
differentiate bootlegs from originals, I advise them to take a 
look: 1. originals always have a colorful box; copies are sold 
in cellophane packets. 2. In the documentation usually the 
illegal books have colorful covers, but inside the text is a 
xerox. Virtually all true books with program documentation are 
printed in at least two colors and if the book has 
illustrations, especially photographs, they are usually color 
illustrations. 3. All diskettes should have the company logo. If 
you still decide to buy the illegal copy, I advise you to check 
it before you leave the store, because usually pirates use bad 
diskettes and half of them don't work. 
  Games comprise the majority of bootlegs. This is not 
surprising because they are the only type of software which is 
constantly updated, and for which the demand is never satiated. 
Of the serious general-purpose programs, the average person only 
needs a couple programming language compilers, one text editor, 
a couple gr aphic editors, DOS, Aidstest, and Norton. He can 
have an unlimited number of games, according to his temperament 
(I, for example, have 350.). Thus, all firms who produce games 
try to protect themselves from piracy. 
  They do this in different ways. Some simply cite the 
copyright law with the fine (in the U.S. up to a million 
dollars) and the imprisonment (up to five years) which one 
incurs for illegal copying and distribution of the product. 
Others use more effective forms of protection, for example, Doc 
check, when the program, either at the very beginning or at the 
most interesting part (if it is a game) suddenly asks one to 
open the accompanying book to some page and enter some word on 
some line of some paragraph, or some password, or a serial 
number, or to find a picture in the documentation and say what 
number it corresponds to, etc. 
  Another more cunning verification method is a disk method. 
The most primitive variety is the presence of information on the 
original diskette which is ``invisible'' to the operating system 
(and consequently to the user) which the program needs, but 
which is not copied from disk to disk. Sometimes the 
verification of placement of files on a disk is used, sometimes 
it is the presence of marked sectors on the disk. Some firms 
format their diskettes so that they are completely unsuitable 
for DOS, but the program itself can be read from it. Sometimes 
they make special key diskettes which cannot be copied and must 
be placed in the disk drive upon the request of the booted 
program. This method of protection is gradually becoming 
obsolete as it is inconvenient for users and virtually all games 
and programs today are so big that one must use a hard disk. 
  Gradually, all software producers are using a new 
information 
carrier, laser disks (CD-ROM) like those used to record music 
and films. They cannot be rewritten, large volumes of 
information can be stored on them (300-600 megabytes, more than 
the average hard disk, for example), and in general they require 
no protection. For this same reason they are not very widespread 
here. By the way, firms are actively working on the ability to 
record on laser disks. This ``problem'' will obviously be solved 
soon, so one will soon be able to copy them as easily as 
diskettes. 
  Small, relatively unknown firms have a tendency to be mean 
to 
pirates. They make their programs so that if illegal copying is 
detected, they either infect the machine with some virus or 
damage all accessible information. It's understandable: Who 
wants to lose several million dollars on pirate copies? But they 
inspire neither respect nor sympathy, but rather malice in 
return. In essence, they are not much better than virus writers 
who do great damage. By the way, these firms usually go bankrupt 
because of their malice. First, people are simply afraid of 
programs which may infect their computer (by accident, for 
example), and second, pirate copies are usually provided with 
programs with a good reputation, and everyone prefers to buy 
what he knows. 
  However, any copy protection is usually little comfort to 
the 
producer because there are always people who know how to get 
around it. They are called crackers (not to be confused with the 
food; rather, safe crackers). These people are good programmers 
who understand the workings of their computer and who have a 
good knowledge of assembler. They crack games and programs so 
that they are incapable of recognizing their illegal status, 
that is, they remove from the program the part which is 
responsible for protection. This is also an entire industry. 
There are large cracking operations involved in the commercial 
distribution of the results of their work (as a rule through 
computer networks) with branches all over the world and a large 
number of members and couriers. There are few computer people 
among us who have not heard of such organizations as the United 
Group or The Dream Team. These two pirate groups, who appeared 
in the U.S., gradually expanded to the entire globe, and now 
even have branches in Russia (and not only in Moscow and St. 
Petersburg). 
  Russia has the largest number of cracker offices and 
individual crackers, but it must be said that cracking programs 
is hack-work here. Frequently games leave the hands of our 
``experts'' in an unusable form, but one usually finds this out 
only in the middle of the game, not at the beginning. The 
crackers need only to sell the ``cracked'' program; you don't 
notice the hack-work at first glance, after which you bang your 
head against the wall. They are filling the Russian underground 
market for games with completely inoperable illegal copies. 
That's how most of the adventure games from Delphine, and the 
Formula 1 games of MicroProse, were cracked; five minutes after 
the machine starts up one loses control, and much else. Western 
crackers periodically send us petitions with a request to take 
this seriously, but they don't accomplish much. 
  The best crackers in the world also live in Russia and 
worked 
in the former KGB. Earlier, their job was to ``crack'' enemy 
information, but since there are no enemies left and they need 
money, they are not squeamish about illegal work. They crack 
only serious programs which offer a great deal of protection for 
a lot of money and by individual order. Good cracker 
organizations are mainly found in the Scandinavian countries. 
  The third branch of the unofficial computer business is 
hint-writing. Here people write hints for adventure computer 
games. Mainly, these are hints which explain what one must do to 
reach the end. Tactics are written for strategic games, and sets 
of control key combinations are written for arcade games and 
simulators. There are fewer hints for logic games. In general, 
this is not completely official and not entirely a business: 
First, firms write their own hints to their games, and hint 
writers do not recopy them, but find their own hints, which are 
not always within their jurisdiction; second, as a rule, hints 
are written without any commercial interest by people who simply 
really like the game and by writing hints can play it anew (I 
know, I have written them myself.). This process is followed by 
pirates, who resell the hints. This is the truly illegal side: 
Some people write hints using passwords (instead of how to 
``break'' the game). A somewhat gray branch of this ``document 
piracy'' is the writing of programming books. These books are 
needed only by those who stole the language they need (the 
software). Registered users have free support. 
  Finally, the fourth and most dangerous branch of the 
underground computer business is hacking-entry into all kinds of 
computer systems and cracking them ``in person.'' There are 
greater profits, greater risks, greater punishments, and 
significantly greater damage done to the victim. I hope to speak 
about this next time. 
  Overall, the illegal computer business is no less complex 
and 
no smaller than the official business. All Russians have been 
drawn to it for a long time. Even if we correct the economic 
situation, which I strongly doubt, and if every citizen has the 
opportunity to buy not only a computer, but also programs for 
it, the situation will not correct itself quickly (if it 
corrects itself at all). We have been taught materialism for so 
many years that we cannot conceive of information, a product of 
intellectual activity which should not be touched, as something 
valuable. Thus, we copy all varieties of information, from music 
to computer programs, from books to films, without thinking that 
their creation involved efforts no less than those expended in 
creating, for example, a microwave oven.

<F P=106> [Article by Stanislav Zigunenko, TEKHNIKA-MOLODEZHI special </F>
correspondent. First paragraph is TEKHNIKA-MOLODEZHI 
introduction, a question from a student.] 
  [Text] ``In 
1990's No. 5 issue, the capabilities of supercomputers were 
described using examples of foreign supercomputers. In 1991's 
No. 1 issue the development of the Elbrus 3-1 domestic 
supercomputer, with a capability of more than a billion 
operations per second, was mentioned. It's 1993 and I'm still 
waiting for you to tell us about this computer in detail.'' 
Vladimir Sergeyev, student, Perm. 
  ``Don't describe our machine as anything special,'' they 
told 
me at the S. A. Lebedev Institute of Precision Mechanics and 
Computing, ``there's nothing special about it.'' 
  This was a strange comment. What was behind it: exaggerated 
modesty or a judicious recognition of the significance of what 
had been done? I got the answer in the computer room where the 
Elbrus 3-1 is being checked out. 
  ``If you want to be scrupulously exact, what stands before 
us 
is not a computer, but a general-purpose multiprocessor 
computing system with well-developed software,'' stated one of 
the authors of this work, the deputy chief designer, Vladimir 
Abramovich Zhukovskiy. ``You can see the difference if you look 
at its architecture. First let's be specific: architecture in 
computing doesn't mean the metal racks and units filling the 
room. Nor does it mean the design, in terms of shape, color, 
etc. Computer architecture can only be clearly seen on a sheet 
of paper showing what's connected to what and in what sequence 
(see schematic).'' 
  The main parts of the Elbrus are the modular switching 
system, the peripheral system, the power supply system, the 
cooling system, and the general system software. 
  Communication with the machine is facilitated by automated 
digital printers, individual control panels, otherwise called 
work stations, and automated digital displays. 
  Today's communication systems make it possible to input data 
and receive the results of calculations without entering the 
computer room, either from the next room or another city. One 
can conduct not only man-machine dialogs, but machine-machine 
dialogs. With one set of adapters the Elbrus 1-5B and Elbrus-2 
representatives of the YeS family of computers can work with the 
Elbrus 3-1. 
  In general, one can increase the power of the computer 
complex, not only with external resources, that is, by attaching 
other computers, but also using the internal features of the 
Elbrus 3-1. 
  The central computer of the Elbrus 3-1 is the modular 
switching system. It, in turn, consists of modular pipeline 
processors, a bulk RAM, and the adapters which connect the 
high-speed switching network. When these adapters are used 
together, 16 modular pipeline processors can be attached, as 
well as 16 RAM units. If this is not enough to solve the 
problem, another 32 channels can be activated to connect in 
more resources, including other computers. 
  The modular pipeline processor itself is comprised of 
several 
modules, each of which executes a certain operation, addition, 
multiplication, etc. If one must first multiply the incoming 
data to solve a problem, and then add it, then the assembly line 
of modules is formed as follows: multiplier first, then summer. 
  Special modules which operate in a general pipeline mode 
make 
it possible to sharply increase speed. It is because of these 
special processors that one can calculate at such a high speed: 
from 50 million operations per second with scalar quantities to 
400 million operations per second with vector quantities. The 
modular switching system may have not one, not two, but four 
processors (in the future more will be possible), so the total 
performance of several such pipelines may reach 1.6 billion 
operations per second or more. 
  The high level of performance of the Elbrus 3-1 creates 
certain technical problems. One of them is that the computer 
heats up when it is in operation, and the excess heat may melt 
contacts, conductors, and integrated microcircuit elements, the 
very foundations upon which the computer is built. 
  The traditional solution, blowing a stream of cold air 
through the units, was ineffective in this case: one could 
create a hurricane in the computer room. Then the developers 
decided to use liquid cooling along with air cooling. 
  Abroad, this is what is frequently done: the units which 
perform the most intense work are placed in Dewar vessels, that 
is, in thermoses with liquid nitrogen or helium. The cooling is 
reliable and in some cases may even reach the superconducting 
stage, but a great deal of frost is formed. We managed to solve 
this problem using very simple measures. 
  Zhukovskiy showed me a micromodule, a plate about 3X3 cm in 
size. It had a radiator through which a cooling fluid was 
pumped. The radiator removes the excess heat from micromodules 
on a board 0.5X0.5 m in size. The fluid then enters a 
refrigerator, where the heat is removed; the fluid is then 
returned to the cooling system. 
  Boards with micromodules are placed in a frame similar to 
the 
plates of glass in a balcony door. The aluminum frame in turn is 
fastened to a column in an equipment rack. Thus, by rotating the 
door, the debuggers and operators can gain access to any unit, 
to each micromodule, even while the machine is in operation. 
This greatly simplifies and speeds up debugging and repair. 
  These are only some of the designs of the many used in the 
construction of one of the first domestic supercomputers. And 
yet, overall, the specialists are not very satisfied with their 
work. For example, abroad one chip can have millions of 
transistors, capacitors, and resistors; here in the best case, 
only hundreds of thousands are possible. The result is a great 
increase in size, mass, and energy consumption, as well as a 
reduction in performance. 
  That is why the developers don't want to say anything 
special 
about their baby: they created a computer using domestic 
micromodules which stands up to the remarkable Cray in a number 
of ways; but if it only exceeded the Cray in every way! 
  American television reporters tagging along at the institute 
held another opinion. They wanted to see with their own eyes and 
show the viewers back home one of wonders of what is to them a 
poorly understood nation. After work people stand in lines for 
increasingly expensive bread; at work they manage to reach the 
level of the world's best achievements. How do they do it? 
  Unfortunately, the answer for us is the same as in the 
famous 
Leskov story of Levsha. There is no scarcity of talent in 
Russia: when there is no magnifying glass, we just sharpen our 
eyesight...

Communications''] 
  [Text] At the center of attention of 
organizers and guests of the press conference held in February 
at the press center of the RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs were 
questions of satellite communications, its present and future. 
Journalists talked about this topic (heretofore largely 
``closed'' to the mass media) with the leaders of legislative 
bodies, industries, agencies and, of course, scientists whose 
efforts are largely responsible for the fame of our engineering 
work in space, including satellite communications. The reason 
for the meeting was launching of the ``Rossiya'' Program of 
Development of Satellite Communications and Broadcasting 
approved by our nation's government last year. 
  Speedy updating of communication facilities has recently 
come 
to be one of the main concerns of the Russian Government. It has 
become abundantly clear that without up-to-date 
telecommunications, we cannot set up an effective mechanism of 
economic reform and integrate ourselves into the international 
community. Reaching this goal over the great expanse of our 
nation is no easy matter, and therefore organization of 
communications via satellite with many remote regions is not 
only more advantageous than building relay lines or laying 
cables, but at times is the only way to get information 
``cargo'' to and from these places. Of course, this is not just 
a matter of telephone calls or data transmission, but also of 
television broadcasting of local and national programs. 
  However, as witnessed by RF Minister of Communications V. B. 
Bulgak, the current level of development of communications 
cannot be considered satisfactory. The communication satellites 
now in use were developed in the seventies, and therefore are 
not up to today's world level in throughput and performance. 
Moreover, there is a shortage not only of the satellites 
themselves, but also of ground stations, which is slowing down 
the development of communications and television broadcasting in 
many regions of the Russian ``boondocks.'' Last year, the 
fraction of satellite communication lines was only 6 percent of 
the total volume of international channels in the nation, while 
actual demand was at least 20 percent. Many reasons have been 
named for such a sad situation, among which one of the main ones 
is the disproportion evolved in the past between the number of 
military and civilian satellites. Figures have even been cited: 
to 140 of the former there have been only 36 of the latter, and 
of those 36 only 10 were designed for communications and 
broadcasting. So one of the main goals of Russian communication 
satellite doctrine is conversion of defense satellites. 
  Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to assume that mere 
launching of new satellites or defense conversion of old ones is 
a panacea. Dozens of satellites may be placed in orbit, but 
nothing would be accomplished. We need a developed reception 
network, as otherwise we will be throwing money ``into space''in 
a real sense. We must uniformly develop the satellite and ground 
segments, making a much greater investment in the latter than is 
now the case. And incidentally, even without launching new 
satellites, we could cover all of Siberia today with TV 
broadcasts; however, the ``satellite potential'' is not being 
completely used because of a lack of ground stations. 
  To correct the situation that has evolved, a Program of 
Development of Satellite Communications and Broadcasting has 
been approved; implementation of this Program will enable us to 
provide telephone service to inaccessible and remote regions of 
Russia, to set up new main networks, to organize mobile 
satellite communication, to considerably increase the volume of 
data transmission and the number of international channels, and 
also to provide multiple-program television broadcasting over 
the entire territory of the nation. In accordance with the 
intention of the developers of the Program (Scientific 
Production Association of Applied Mechanics, Scientific Research 
Institute of Radio, Central Scientific Research Institute of 
Communications, ``Avtomatika'' Production Association and 
``Iskra'' Production Association), the entire satellite 
communication system will consist of three subsystems: fixed 
satellite service, mobile communications, and direct television 
broadcasting. 
  Within the scope of the first subsystem, trunk and 
international communication lines will be organized, as well as 
lines of intrazonal and rural communications, business 
communications and data networks. Priority will be given to 
zonal and local communications, particularly in regions of the 
Far North, Siberia and the Far East, where communication is 
possible generally only via satellite. The subsystem of mobile 
communications will connect subscribers of mobile and remote 
facilities: ships and aircraft, railroad transport and the like 
situated not only on the territory of Russia, but also beyond 
its borders. Finally, direct television broadcasting will be the 
base for organizing universal coverage by two national TV 
programs and also local (regional) programs. 
  To handle these tasks, new advanced satellites are to be 
developed as outlined by Academician M. F. Reshetnov, general 
designer and director general of the Scientific Production 
Association of Applied Mechanics. Incidentally, not many of us 
had ever even heard of the SPA of AM. Situated in the formerly 
classified city of Krasnoyarsk-23, this enterprise for several 
decades has been the center of realization of nearly all our 
space programs, both military and civilian. But, of course, 
defense purposes predominated. The SPA of AM is now ``beating 
swords into plowshares,'' and to that end a joint-stock company 
of the same name has already been set up within the scope of the 
Association, dealing with the business of bringing life to the 
Program of development of Russian satellite communications, 
mainly on a commercial basis. 
  Work is in progress today at the SPA of AM on new 
satellites: 
``Gals,'' ``Ekspress,'' ``Arkos,'' ``Gonets,'' ``Sovkanstar'' 
and ``Mayak.'' These will not just replace their predecessors in 
orbit, but will take on some new functions as well. For example, 
the well known ``Gorizont'' satellites will be gradually 
replaced by ``Ekspress'' satellites that will begin operating 
next year. The first ``Ekspress'' will be launched this year. 
The new satellites will support transmission of television 
programs, as well as telephony signals and data. For these 
satellites, the Scientific Research Institute of Radio is 
developing new ground stations with antennas 2.5-4 m in 
diameter. And in a few years, the ``Ekspress-M'' satellite is to 
be launched, which will need a ``dish'' only 0.9-1.5 m in 
diameter for signal reception. 
  According to tentative estimates, introduction of 
``Ekspress'' satellites will quadruple or quintuple the 
throughput of the satellite communication system, and the 
lifetime of the satellite itself will be more than doubled. The 
increased throughput of the ``Ekspress'' trunks will be made 
possible by the use of new multiple access equipment with FDM 
and TDM, high-speed modems in ground stations, and the use of 
statistical multiplexing equipment in the latter. 
  Quite promising is the prospect of introducing low-orbit 
``Gonets'' satellites that will be used to transmit various 
kinds of information, including signals for E-mail service. The 
whole world is showing interest in low-orbit satellites, though 
we have been using them for decades, strictly for military 
purposes, of course. The principal advantages of communication 
systems with such satellites are low cost, and the capability of 
using simple and inexpensive terminals. The SPA of AM is now 
working on the first civilian low-orbit satellite, which last 
year was granted a ``visa'' for the radio band of 300/400 MHz by 
the World Administrative Conference on Radio Frequencies 
(WACR-92). Plans call for launching 36 ``Gonets'' satellites 
into circular orbit at an altitude of about 1500 km. The 
low-orbit satellite system should begin working in 1994-1995. 
  Another new thing learned by those attending the press 
conference: ``Gals'' satellites with three-band on-board relay, 
and ``Gals-R'' satellites with four-band relay. This equipment 
can be used to organize regional television broadcasting to 
individual small-sized receiver stations. Five sets will be 
integrated into a group to provide relay broadcasting to five 
two-hour time zones of as many as four television and radio 
programs. For signal reception from ``Gals,'' the Scientific 
Research Institute of Radio has developed ground stations with 
antennas 2.5 and 1.5 m in diameter (professional) and 0.9 m in 
diameter (individual). 
  Nor did speakers fail to give attention to the ``Marafon'' 
mobile satellite system, which has been a topic of discussion 
for several years. It turns out that it will be introduced in 
the not very distant future. ``Arkos'' satellites are to be 
launched into geostationary orbit next year, and ``Mayak'' 
satellites will be put into highly elliptical orbit in 
1995-1996. Five ``Arkoses'' and four ``Mayaks'' will be the 
basis of the ``Marafon'' system that will begin to operate in 
full volume early next century. The throughput of the future 
system will be 1800-2000 telephone channels. 
  Naturally, the expense of implementing such an ambitious 
Program will be enormous. The handouts at the press conference 
gave a figure of 13 billion rubles for the period from 1992 
through the year 2000 in 1991 prices. Where do we intend to get 
this money? It was explained that only 9.8 percent of this sum 
will be taken from the federal budget. All the rest will come 
from monies outside the budget. It is proposed that interest be 
maximized on the part of Russian businessmen and foreign 
investors. The SPA of AM has already made good progress in 
accumulating experience in such business activity by offering to 
lease Russian satellites to foreign companies, including 
launching services and technical support. 
  Another example of international cooperation in space is the 
Russian- Canadian project ``Sovkanstar,'' providing for setting 
up an international commercial satellite communication system to 
cover Russia and several other nations. Our specialists will 
design the satellite platform, and the Canadians will design the 
payload: a relay and antennas with minimum weight and energy 
consumption. Provisions also call for production of inexpensive 
Russian ground stations with antennas 2.5 and 1.5 m in diameter 
intended for business communications. In a word, our work in 
aeronautics and space, which has recently been on the brink of 
economic disaster, may now become a rather lucrative business.

Provinces''] 
  [Text] Joint Venture "Sprint Set" began 
operation in 1991. It was set up by Central Telegraph (Moscow) 
and the U.S. corporation Sprint International Communications 
with annual income of more than 9 billion dollars, which has the 
world's largest data network and produces communications 
equipment. 
  ``Sprint Set'' in Moscow: telephone (095)201-68-90; fax 
(095)923-23-44; telex 414750 SOVSN SU 
  Those of us who have tried, especially from outlying 
districts, to fax a business letter or personal correspondence 
to another nation know what a headache it is to have to dial up 
the operator, place the order, wait in line... 
  At the same time, by using the ``Sprint Global Fax'' system 
that has just been introduced into Russia by the Russian-U.S. 
joint venture ``Sprint Set,'' even a provincial owner of a fax 
machine need only dial a Moscow number on a conventional 
telephone line, and his message will be automatically faxed to 
one or a hundred addresses in any nations of the world. 
  ``We are trying to do everything to make the level of 
communication services of developed nations accessible to 
ordinary people in Russia and other nations of the former 
USSR,'' says Henry Radzikowski, director general of "Sprint Set" 
joint venture. ``To do so, we have concluded agreements with 
major telegraph offices on Russian territory, and have installed 
modern communication nodes in such cities as St. Petersburg, 
Rostov-na-Donu, Novosibirsk, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Irkutsk and 
Khabarovsk. This equipment, produced by 'Sprint International 
Communications,' a U.S. telecommunications corporation, has 
become the main data network for computer communications in 
Russia.'' 
  ``The creation of structures in provinces in partnership 
with 
local communications enterprises and other investors that might 
participate in organizing and operating modern communication 
nodes is one of the top- priority goals of `Sprint Set','' 
continues Henry Radzikowski. ``In future, we will reach a point 
where we can install a minimum set of equipment in oblast 
centers, and even rayon centers; then people in the most remote 
province will be able to have reliable communication with the 
entire world. We are also supplying equipment to our partners 
who are setting up their own communication centers, but are 
connected to us. Among others, there are already such centers in 
Perm, Kiev, Riga, Tashkent, Vladivostok and other cities of the 
CIS and Baltic states. In the near future, there will be such 
centers in Novosibirsk, Yakutsk, Omsk, Tomsk, Barnaul and 
Volgograd. The communication services of `Sprint Set' are also 
proliferated through a network of distributors. In other words, 
we would like to facilitate creation of the most modern data 
utility network in cities of the CIS and Baltic states that will 
have an outlet to 110 world nations via the SprintNet global 
data network.'' 
  In the words of sales and marketing director Tatyana 
Prokhorova, the most popular service among clients is E-mail: 
``This is the exchange of electronic messages, transmission to 
the fax or telex of another subscriber at any point on the 
globe. Last year, `Sprint Set' finished work enabling E-mail 
subscribers to interact with 120,000 clients of the Russian 
AT-50 teleprinter exchange service.'' 
  ``Among our clients are the Ministry of Defense, the 
Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Security of Russia, the 
Russian affiliate of the World Association of Nuclear Plant 
Operators, Morflot, `Interfaks' Information Agency, and major 
world corporations like IBM, Texaco, 3M, and British Petroleum.'' 
  Tatyana Prokhorova emphasizes that more than 100 ``nearby'' 
and ``remote'' foreign banks have become clients, using ``Sprint 
Set'' to expedite handling of negotiable instruments and 
information both within their own system and among separate 
banks. The joint venture also assists them in organizing 
electronic correspondence with foreign partners. The system of 
communication services offered by the company, which is based on 
the capabilities of the data network, hardware and software for 
handling transactions, among other things enables banking, 
commercial and travel institutions within seconds to verify the 
credit of a customer using a charge card, and to automatically 
process data for clearing transactions for goods and services. 
  The rapidly developing package and complexity of services 
offered by ``Sprint Set,'' from furnishing communication lines 
to delivery of turnkey equipment in accordance with customer 
specifications, their exceptionally high quality and 24-hour 
customer support has made ``Sprint Set'' a leader in the 
development of modern technology of data transmission on the 
territory of the former USSR. 
  The joint venture has developed and put into service an 
extensive network for Bashkortostan, contracts have been signed 
and the development of republic-wide data networks has begun in 
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. 
  The joint venture has made an announcement of production of 
advanced telecommunication equipment in Russia. 
  But still the basic attraction is that ``Sprint Set'' joint 
venture knows how to organize and conduct telecommunication 
business oriented toward customer needs. Under conditions of 
market development and the necessity of converting from 
antiquated to modern communication technologies, this factor is 
becoming decisive.

<F P=106> [Article by R. Levin: ``Hands Across the Baltic: Russian </F>
President B. N. Yeltsin Has Opened a New Automatic International 
Communication System''] 
  [Text] Unusual animation held sway in the room of the 
Moscow international dial office in the capital region of 
Belyayevo on the morning of 10 April. A crowd of journalists, 
our own and from other nations, high-level European and U.S. 
diplomats, and finally, the arriving presidential entourage 
entering the room headed by B. N. Yeltsin, all bore witness to 
the importance of the forthcoming event. Such considerable 
attention to the international communication system brought 
about by the efforts of specialists, organizations and companies 
from Russia, Denmark and other nations was no coincidence: for 
the first time Russia and Western Europe were being joined by a 
fiber-optics communication line laid at the bottom of the Baltic 
Sea. 
  And so, from this day forth, our citizens can be connected 
with no great effort to 170 world nations, and in Moscow and St. 
Petersburg there will be no need to go through operators and be 
bothered with waiting for the call to be completed: callers will 
be able to dial direct to almost any point on the globe. Such is 
the result of concerted work by the ``Intertelekom'' Joint-Stock 
Company and its foreign partners: Telecom Denmark, the Great 
Northern Telegraph Company of Denmark, and a number of other 
companies from Europe, the United States and Japan. The fiber- 
optics communication line that they have laid at the bottom of 
the Baltic in conjunction with a number of new radio relay lines 
and municipal dial offices is capable of carrying 15,360 
simultaneous telephone calls. We remind you that just last year 
there were only 2900 international channels in all of Russia, 
and the only Moscow international dial office, built in 1980, 
was pretty well overloaded. 
  The end points of the new communication line, which is 2085 
km long, are Moscow and the Danish town of Albertslund near 
Copenhagen, where the fiber-optics communication line is 
connected to the international telephone network. The underwater 
fiber-optics cable, 4 cm in diameter, consists of two pairs of 
fibers having throughput of 565 Mbit/s, and is 1250 km long. On 
the Russian shore, the cable emerges onto dry land in the 
vicinity of Kingisepp. Thence to St. Petersburg and Moscow, 
where three new international telephone offices are installed, 
the relay race is continued by two radio relay lines with 
lengths of 124 and 810 km respectively. The section of the radio 
relay line to Moscow is designed for 5760 channels (3x140 
Mbit/s), and the one to St. Petersburg for 3840 channels (2x140 
Mbit/s). In addition, each main section has a reserve 10 Mbit/s 
trunk that is automatically connected in case of malfunctions. 
  It took just two months to lay the cable along the sea 
bottom, a time that was full of the most unexpected problems for 
those taking part in this complicated operation: Danish cable 
specialists and our divers. For the first time in world 
practice, the task was to bury the cable 60 cm under the bottom 
over the entire multikilometer line. However, it was not until 
work had already begun that it was learned that the heavy marine 
plow, weighing 25 metric tons, by which the cable was to be 
buried, could not be used along the shallow Russian coast. 
Divers had to do the job. But the plow could not always be used 
even in the open sea because it ``stumbled'' over other cables 
or rocky ground. And here all kinds of contrivances had to be 
devised. And when laying the shore cable near Kingisepp under 
arduous land conditions, the builders used an unusual approach: 
the excavator was set up on a raft from which the machine first 
broke through ice, and then made a trench along the bottom in 
which divers laid the cable. Nevertheless, difficulties did not 
stop the project from completion on time. 
  Expenditures on construction of the system amounted to 500 
million rubles and 123 million U.S. dollars. The principal 
investors were the "Intertelekom" Joint-Stock Company, the 
Danish companies Telecom Denmark and GNTC, and also the American 
company U.S. West International. Construction of the new line 
did not impact in any way on growth of the national debt of the 
country, as the government of Russia offered no financial 
guarantees to the parties in the project. At the same time, all 
of the system situated on our territory, and also the underwater 
section of the fiber-optics communication line to the midway 
point have become the property of Russia. 
  Equipment suppliers were determined on a competitive basis. 
They were the British company STC Submarine Systems which 
supplied the optical cable, amplifiers and other equipment for 
the underwater line; the Japanese company NEC, which furnished 
the digital equipment for the relay section; and the Croatian 
company Nikola Tesla which installed its AXE-10 digital 
switching offices in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Credit for 
purchase of the AXE-10 dial offices in the amount of 34.5 
million dollars was provided by U.S. West Int. The Moscow 
offices are designed for 7801 and 4780 channels and lines, and 
the St. Petersburg office for 4170. 
  The Russian President became the first subscriber to the 
system. At the festive opening ceremony in the presence of a 
throng of guests, B. N. Yeltsin and the Danish Prime Minister P. 
Rasmussen had a talk by videophone, ending with a symbolic 
handshake between the leaders of the two nations bound by the 
five-hundred year history of their diplomatic relations. Boris 
Nikolayevich praised the work of Russian and foreign specialists 
who had taken part in setting up the Denmark-Russia line, and 
presented the distinguished order of Friendship of Nations. 
Those present were congratulated for completion of construction 
by Minister of Communications of the Russian Federation V. B. 
Bulgak, and by the heads of diplomatic delegations of Denmark 
and the United States; there was also an announcement of a 
message sent by U.S. President B. Clinton to B. N. Yeltsin on 
the occasion of opening up the new international 
telecommunication system. 
  However, in the words of V. B. Bulgak, there is still a long 
way to go before the needs of the nation for international 
telephone service are satisfied. Therefore plans have been made 
to begin operation of the Southern, Eastern and Trans-Siberian 
sections of a trunk that will close the world telecommunication 
ring before 1998. The overall capacity of the international 
telephone offices of Russia, according to tentative estimates, 
will be 29,000 channels in 1995, 40,500 in the year 2000, and 
64,000 by the year 2005. 
  Within the scope of the Southern project, it is proposed 
that 
a Novosibirsk-Istanbul-Palermo fiber-optics communication line 
be built, 3400 km long, with an extension to Moscow (1622 km), 
and also that an international telephone office be opened in 
Rostov-na-Donu. The Eastern project includes a 
Russia-Japan-Korea underwater fiber-optics communication line 
1809 km long with 930-kilometer Nakhodka-Khabarovsk cable 
section. On the Trans-Siberian section of the trunk, a Moscow- 
Khabarovsk digital radio relay line is to be constructed, 8300 
km in length with capacity of 11,520 channels. It is planned 
that international telephone offices will be introduced by 
stages in Khabarovsk, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg and Samara. 
Foreign communications operators and producers of equipment will 
take an active part in realization of these projects. 
  Opening of the Russia-Denmark line has provided a rather 
graphic demonstration that cooperation with us in such 
large-scale projects is not only possible, but even 
advantageous. For example, Telecom Denmark has already sold part 
of the capacity of the new underwater cable to 22 communications 
operators from the United States, Belgium, Italy, Germany, 
France and other nations. From the very beginning of operation 
of the Trans-Siberian trunk, there will certainly be even more 
extensive opportunities for cooperation in the field of 
communications.

  2.2.3. The reactor plant detail design must demonstrate that 
given design emergencies related to a rapid increase in

introduction of negative reactivity at any section of their 
movement path. 
  2.2.12. The fuel assembly design must ensure that the change 
in the shape of fuel elements and other fuel assembly elements 
possible under normal operations, departures from normal 
operation, and design emergencies does not result in blocking

above the corresponding limits and does not prevent normal 
functioning of the end effectors of the reactivity control 
system of the reactor. 
  2.2.13. The fuel assembly design must have distinguishing

coordinated in an established procedure. 
  2.7.1.4. During recharging and repair operations, 
organizational measures and, if possible, technical facilities 
must be employed to prevent accidental ingress of extraneous 
objects into the inner space of the primary circuit. 
  2.7.1.5. In the reactors where recharging is carried out 
with 
decoupling of the reactivity control system end effectors, 
recharging must be carried out with the reactivity control 
system end effectors and other reactivity control facilities 
inserted into the core. In so doing, the minimum reactor 
subcriticality during the recharging process should be at least 
0.02 allowing for possible errors. 
  2.7.1.6. In reactors where recharging is carried out with 
decoupling of the reactivity control system end effectors and 
where reactivity is compensated for by a liquid absorber 
solution, recharging must be carried out with the reactivity 
control system end effectors and other reactivity control 
facilities inserted into the reactor core. The liquid absorber 
solution concentration must be brought to a value at which a 
reactor subcriticality of at least 0.02 is ensured allowing for 
possible errors but without taking into account the inserted 
reactivity control system end effectors. 
  2.7.1.7. In the reactors in which the necessary 
subcriticality during recharging is ensured by the liquid 
absorber solution, engineering and organizational measures must 
be stipulated to ensure that delivery of clean condensate to the 
reactor and primary circuit are ruled out during recharging. 
  2.7.1.8. In pressure vessel reactors with a top reactivity 
control system actuator positioning, the reactor and reactivity 
control system end effector design must ensure that the 
reactivity control system end effectors are in the uncoupled 
state when the top module is removed; in this case, the 
diagnostic facilities must record the decoupled state. 
  2.7.1.9. Fuel recharging in a shut-down pressure-tube 
reactor 
must be carried out with the emergency reactor protection system 
end effectors cocked. In so doing, the minimum reactor 
subcriticality during the recharging process must amount to at 
least 0.02 allowing for possible errors. 
  2.7.1.10. For the reactor plants in which fuel recharging is 
carried out during the reactor power operation, the reactor 
plant detail design must justify and define the permissible 
operating reactor plant conditions (e.g., power, coolant rate, 
etc.) during the recharging process as well as justify the 
efficacy of the facilities used for suppressing excess 
reactivity whose introduction is possible due to recharging 
errors or reactivity effects. 
  2.7.1.11. If recharging is carried out during the reactor 
power operation, the primary reactor plant circuit 
pressure-tightness must not be violated, and facilities must be 
stipulated for checking the absence of coolant leaks from the 
primary reactor plant circuit. 
  2.7.1.12. After the end of recharging, tests must be carried 
out to confirm the principal design and theoretical neutron 
characteristics of the reactor core. 
  During the tests, it is necessary to check whether the 
experimental test findings are consistent with the theoretical 
parameters according to the criteria established by the reactor 
plant detail design. 
  2.7.2. Requirements for Recharging Devices 
  2.7.2.1. The reactor plant detail design must justify and 
enumerate the makeup of the recharging devices as well as the 
requirements imposed on them; compliance with these requirements 
must ensure fuel assembly handling safety during recharging, 
including the cases of failures and damage to the fuel 
recharging devices. 
  2.7.2.2. The reactor plant detail design must stipulate the 
engineering facilities for ensuring heat removal from the fuel 
assemblies being recharged. 
  2.7.2.3. The recharging devices must be designed so that 
normal reactor plant and nuclear fuel storage operation 
conditions are not violated in the cases of their normal 
performance or damage. 
  2.7.2.4. The reactor plant detail design must contain the 
requirements imposed on the erection, operation, and periodic 
inspection of the recharging devices as well as the requirements 
for their reliability. 
  2.7.2.5. The recharging devices must be designed 
(constructed) in such a way so as to ensure access during 
inspections, repairs, tests, and maintenance and servicing. 
  2.7.2.6. In designing the recharging devices, measures must 
be stipulated aimed at preventing the fuel assemblies from 
damage, deformation, breakdown, or falls as well as application 
of impermissible forces to the fuel elements during their 
extraction or installation. The values of the maximum 
permissible force must be summarized in the reactor plant detail 
design. The use of recharging facilities not stipulated by the 
design is prohibited. 
  2.7.2.7. In designing the recharging devices, it is 
necessary 
to stipulate that interruptions of power supply do not result in 
fuel assembly falls. 
  2.7.2.8. The reactor plant detail design must justify and 
establish the permissible velocities at which the fuel 
assemblies are moved by the recharging devices. 
  2.7.2.9. The design must stipulate protective devices which 
ensure the movement of recharging devices within permissible 
limits. 
  2.7.2.10. In the cases of recharging device failure or 
departures from their operating conditions, the reactor plant 
detail design must stipulate equipment for reliably transferring 
fuel to safe locations. 
  2.7.2.11. The recharging devices must be equipped with

monitored using closed circuit TV. 
  2.7.2.15. The draft design of the fuel recharging devices 
must be coordinated with the USSR State Committee for Safety in 
Industry and Atomic Power Industry unless it has been 
coordinated as a part of the reactor plant detail design. 
  3. Requirements for Ensuring Nuclear Safety During Reactor 
Plant Operation

operation is the reactor plant detail design which contains the 
rules and basic safe operation principles as well as the general 
procedure of carrying out the operations related to the reactor 
plant safety and the limits and conditions of safe operation. 
  The reactor plant process operation regulations, the reactor 
plant equipment servicing and maintenance regulations, and the

plant operating manual and reactor plant system and equipment 
operation instructions developed by the nuclear station 
personnel on the basis of the design and development 
documentation and reactor plant operation process regulations 
corrected on the basis of the outcome of physical and power 
startups and operating experience. 
  The reactor plant operating manual must be coordinated with 
the chief designer of the reactor plant, scientific supervisor, 
and chief developer of the nuclear station and must be approved 
by the chief engineer of the nuclear station.

reactor plant. 
  Nuclear station operation is permitted after the issuance of 
a reactor plant certificate by the USSR State Committee for 
Safety in Industry and Atomic Power Industry and an operating 
permit obtained from the USSR State Committee for Safety in 
Industry and Atomic Power Industry. Changes in the parameters 
stipulated in the reactor plant certificate call for issuing a 
new certificate. These amendments must be coordinated beforehand 
with the scientific supervisor and chief designer of the reactor 
plant. The certificate format and the scope of the information 
contained in it are established by the USSR State Committee for 
Safety in Industry and Atomic Power Industry.

operation, the reactor plant must be shut down. 
  3.8. Should an emergency situation develop at the reactor 
plant, the causes for its development must be identified and 
eliminated, and measures must be taken for restoring normal 
reactor plant operation. Reactor plant operation may be 
continued only after establishing and eliminating the causes for 
the emergency situation development upon written permission of 
the chief engineer of the nuclear station.

feasibility analysis. The instruction must consider design 
emergencies and develop measures for remediating the accident 
aftermath. The instruction must be coordinated with the 
scientific supervisor, chief designer of the reactor plant, and 
chief developer of the nuclear station. 
  3.13. A special manual must be developed in accordance with 
design documentation for controlling off-design emergencies; it 
should be coordinated with the scientific supervisor, chief 
designer of the reactor plant, and chief developer of the

the 
investigation carried out by the commission to identify the 
causes of accidents, it is strictly prohibited to open the 
instrumentation and devices and to change the emergency and 
preventive signaling and protection system settings. 
  Organizational and technical measures must be stipulated to 
eliminate the possibility of losing recorded data and 
unauthorized access to the devices and elements, data bank, and 
archives of control and monitoring systems which recorded the 
reactor plant situation before the onset of the accident and 
during the ensuing period.

tests and repair operations conducted on the primary reactor 
plant circuit, the reactor, primary reactor plant circuit, and 
related systems must be filled with a liquid absorber solution 
at a concentration not dropping below that stipulated by the 
reactor plant detail design. 
<H3>  Notes: This requirement pertains to the reactors in which

  3.23. After completing repairs of the reactor plant 
equipment 
and systems crucial for safety, the characteristics of these 
systems must be checked to see whether they correspond to design 
parameters. The inspection must be carried out according to the 
program developed by senior nuclear station management and 
compiled on the basis of the regulations developed by the chief 
developer of the nuclear station and chief designer of the 
reactor plant and coordinated with the scientific supervisor. 
  3.24. During any tests of systems crucial for safety, it is

  [Text] PREFACE 
  More than six years have elapsed since that fateful day when 
the explosion of a reactor at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power 
Plant became a new benchmark in the history of development not 
only of nuclear power, but of all human civilization. The 
consequences of this unprecedented disaster have directly or 
indirectly impacted on the destinies of entire nations and 
regions, millions of people, and natural systems, and will be 
felt for many decades to come in future generations. Therefore 
from the very inception and up until the present our scientists 
and specialists and their foreign colleagues have never ceased 
for a single day their work on analysis of the causes and 
consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and the search for ways 
to overcome them. 
  In the former USSR, this activity has been carried out by a 
number of governmental and non-governmental organizations, among 
which an important part has been played by the Commission of the 
Supreme Soviet of the USSR on Examining the Causes of the 
Accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant and 
Evaluating the Actions of Officials in the Post-Accident Period. 
Working within this Commission has been a Standing Panel of 
Experts (SPE) including about 200 eminent specialists 
representing many fields of science and engineering in all three 
of the republics hardest hit by the disaster: Belarus, Ukraine 
and Russia. This group of scientists has done tremendous work on 
gathering, analyzing and generalizing a large body of materials, 
most of which were scattered throughout agencies and over 
territories, making access difficult. A lot of new information 
was also obtained directly at the locality of the events, 
including at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant itself. 
  Although the Supreme Soviet of the USSR was dissolved in 
late 
1991, the activity of the SPE nevertheless did not stop. 
SENMURV, a non- governmental international society for restoring 
the environment and safe habitation of man, has considered 
offering support to the panel of experts as its civil and moral 
obligation. Such cooperation proceeds from the logic of creation 
and activity of SENMURV, as reflected in its charter and name. 
How to reduce the detrimental impact of irrational human 
actions, how to protect Man, his health, the health of nations, 
how to restore our environment--these are the main problems that 
united scientists and businessmen of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine 
in the SENMURV International Society. 
  Over the last two decades, especially in the eighties, the 
scales and depth of consequences of economic and other activity 
on the territory of Russia and other CIS nations for nature and 
society have reached the limit beyond which an ecological 
problem has grown into a problem of national security, survival 
of a nation in the long-term historical perspective. 
  The global nature of ill-considered human activity in 
mining, 
carrying out large-scale power engineering projects, development 
of industry, transportation and the agroindustrial complex has 
resulted in an unpredictable ecological situation. Anthropogenic 
alterations of landscapes, demographic shifts, concentration of 
ecologically harmful production facilities on limited areas, and 
disregard for requirements of creating low-waste production 
facilities have given rise to totally new ecological factors 
that could lead to irreversible genetic changes in populations 
and communities. 
  Besides the continual poisoning of nature and people with 
wastes of harmful substances of existing enterprises, the 
presence of a large number of burial sites of radioactive and 
chemical wastes, threatening gradual exhaustion of the 
ecological potential and gene pool of Russia, there has been an 
increase in the risk of technogenic disasters. Damage due to 
industrial accidents alone averages 1.2-1.5 percent of the GNP, 
and in the most severe accidents like the one at Chernobyl, it 
exceeds the given figures by nearly an order of magnitude. Last 
but not least, as a result of such extraordinary situations, and 
also because ecological requirements are not met in handling 
radioactive (and other toxic) wastes and the acquisition of 
uranium deposits, Russia and other CIS nations are now faced 
with just about the worst radioecological scenario in the world. 
  Based on the urgency of its tasks, as well as on the 
professional orientation of its specialists, the SENMURV 
International Society is concentrating its activity on restoring 
the environment and safe habitation of man, combining 
international efforts of businessmen and scientists representing 
various fields of knowledge: biotechnology, physical chemistry, 
biology, biophysics, medicine, mathematics and systems analysis. 
Such an interdisciplinary approach is a guarantee of rapid 
advancement in problems of ecology, revealing new ways of 
solving them, and especially the Chernobyl problem. 
  Within the framework of the SENMURV International Society, 
the aforementioned panel of experts has been transformed to a 
Joint Expert Committee (JEC), which can be treated as its 
successor. This committee has continued work on preparation of 
its chief document: the expert conclusion that is being 
presented in this publication. The expert conclusion consists of 
four volumes: 
  Part 1. ``Direct Causes of Accident at Chernobyl Nuclear 
Electric Plant. Radiation Monitoring. Protective Measures and 
Their Effectiveness.'' 
  Part 2. ``Medical-Biological and Genetic Consequences of the 
Chernobyl Disaster.'' 
  Part 3. ``Consequences of the Disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear 
Electric Power Plant for the Republic of Belarus.'' 
  Part 4. ``Consequences of the Disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear 
Electric Power Plant for Ukraine and Russia.'' 
  The following expert coordinators guided the team of authors 
in preparation of this expert conclusion: 
  V. B. Nesterenko--professor, associate member of Belarus 
Academy of Sciences. 
  Ye. B. Burlakova--professor, Chairwoman of Council on 
Radiobiology of Russian Academy of Sciences. 
  Ye. A. Yakovlev--Academician of Ukrainian Ecological Academy 
of Sciences. 
  V. A. Shevchenko--professor. 
  N. A. Tsepalova--candidate of chemical sciences. 
  D. S. Firsova--journalist, laureate of Lenin and State 
prizes 
of the USSR. 
  A. G. Nazarov--professor, associate member of Russian 
Academy 
of Natural Sciences. 
  B. N. Profiryev--professor, associate member of Russian 
Academy of Natural Sciences. 
  D. P. Osanov--professor. 
  G. S. Sakulin--professor. 
  L. N. Shadrin--professor. 
  While not all parts of this expert conclusion are of equal 
significance, all experts have endeavored to be maximally 
objective in analyzing events and documents, as well as in 
offering differing viewpoints. This has been aided by giving 
each expert creative freedom, the opportunity of setting up 
creative teams and formulating conclusions without hindrance. 
  Considerable assistance was provided to the panel of experts 
on the first stage of its work by the ``Chernobyl-Pomoshch'' 
Non-Governmental International Humanitarian Organization. 
  If this expert conclusion will attract the attention not 
just 
of specialists, economists and politicians, but simply the 
people living on contaminated territories and the public at 
large, we will feel that our labor has made its contribution to 
analysis of the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl 
disaster. 
  We hope that the number of supporters of those who have 
devoted their activity and are giving their efforts and energy 
to restoring our environment will increase, and then the 
concepts of ``Man. Earth. Universe'' will become indivisible and 
everlasting. That man might live forever and dwell on a 
blossoming, beautiful earth, unique and inimitable in the 
universe.
