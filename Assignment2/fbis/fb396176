  [Text] Harbin, January 7 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese leader has 
urged officials at all levels to do more to help enterprises and 
households overcome difficulties. 
  Li Ruihuan, a member of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central 
Committee, made the call during an inspection of northeast 
China's Heilongjiang Province this week. 
  He stressed that government officials should help people 
with 
difficulties to enjoy the Spring Festival holiday, which falls 
February 10. 
  The living standards of the Chinese people have been 
markedly 
improved thanks to rapid economic growth. However, some people 
have not benefited as much as others from the economic 
prosperity, he said. 
  He emphasized that the party is determined to make sure that 
economic development is geared in such a way that nobody is left 
out in the national drive for a better life. 
  Li, who also doubles as chairman of the National Committee 
of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the 
country's top political advisory body, said that the government 
should consider the interests of the people in every aspect. He 
pointed out that it should by all means guarantee the basic 
living conditions of the broad masses, who have not so far 
benefited from the reform measures. 
  He noted that while most people will benefit from the 
reforms, not every individual is entitled to improvement at the 
same time and to the same degree. 
  He urged Communist Party officials to attend to people's 
needs and curtail official spending in order to appropriate 
funds to aid people suffering hardships.

  [Text] At a national work conference on politics and law 
which ended today [25 December], Luo Gan, state councillor and 
deputy secretary of the Central Commission on Politics and Law, 
said: It is necessary to conduct in-depth survey and study, 
keep abreast of the developing situation, and improve and reform 
the work on politics and law. He said: Comparatively more 
reform measures will be adopted next year. If our work on 
politics and law lags behind schedule, serious consequences will 
arise. Therefore, we must earnestly understand the guidelines 
of the instructions given by the central authorities on 
improving and reforming the work on politics and law; conduct 
in-depth survey and study by integrating them with the operation 
of each department; make further suggestions on each 
department's work and draw up plans for reform; organize their 
implementation under proper guidance and in a planned way; and 
strive to make the work of each political and legal department 
meet the needs of developing a socialist market economy. Luo 
Gan said the national work conference on politics and law, which 
ended today, was a great success. He required that close 
attention be paid to relaying the guidelines of the conference 
and to preventing bureaucracy and formalism in a bid to produce 
results from the work on politics and law at an early date.

<F P=106> [By reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 7160): "Luo Gan </F>
Requires Public Security Organs To Exert Themselves to Safeguard 
Social and Political Stability"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEH SHE)--Luo Gan, 
state councillor and deputy secretary of the CPC Central 
Commission on Politics and Law, today said: To deepen reform 
and accelerate development, we must have a guaranteed stable 
social and political environment. It is hoped that public 
security organs and the armed police force will keep a strong 
sense of political responsibility and mission and exert 
themselves to do a good job in safeguarding social and political 
stability. 
  When giving a speech at the national meeting attended by 
directors of the public security departments and bureaus, Luo 
Gan said that this year, a series of major reform measures will 
be successively adopted for the finance-taxation, banking, 
investment system, foreign trade, and price systems. The depth, 
breadth, and intensity of reform will substantially exceed those 
in previous years. In the long run, these reform measures are 
of great significance for increasing China's comprehensive 
national strength, enhancing the people's living standards, and 
promoting well- coordinated economic and social development. 
However, they will immediately affect various quarters in 
different degrees and lead to adjustment of individual 
interests. Some new contradictions may thus appear, and some 
problems that affect social stability may also be brought about. 
Therefore, it is particularly necessary to keep a "sense of 
risk." 
  He said: With economic development, there will be no 
foundation for stability and it will not be possible to keep 
social order and stability over a long time. Similarly, without 
a stable social environment, nothing will be accomplished. 
Therefore, going all out to safeguard social stability and 
promoting economic construction and advancing reform and opening 
is a major point of China's experience in basic practice over 
the past 15 years. 
  Public order and security is a major aspect of social and 
political stability. Luo Gan said: In the last few years, 
public order and security were stable on the whole, but we 
should also note that cases of economic crime and other criminal 
cases markedly increased, and various ugly social phenomena also 
became rather prominent in some localities. In some localities, 
organized crime bearing the character of secret societies also 
occurred. Public security organs should adopt effective 
measures in light of the new characteristics of law-and-order 
problems under the situation of reform and opening, continuously 
settle prominent problems in public order and security, and 
effectively prevent the appearance of a lawless situation in 
some localities. 
  He stressed the need to intensively and effectively crack 
down on various serious criminal activities, and raise the 
severe crackdown [yan da dong zheng 0917 2092 2435 3630] to a 
new high. The crackdown should achieve a deterrent effect. A 
number of prominent problems that threaten the safety of the 
masses should be settled in a short time, thus frightening and 
deterring criminals and also encouraging the masses. At the 
same time, laws must be enforced strictly. 
  Luo Gan praised the public security organs for their 
effective work last year in safeguarding social and political 
stability and state security. At the same time, he also 
required public security organs to do effective internal 
anticorruption work. At present, efforts should be made to 
investigate and handle major and serious cases, and effectively 
check problems of offending and bending the law in the course of 
enforcing it among public security personnel. Corrupt personnel 
must be severely punished.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Di Qiyun (5049 0796 6663) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Liu Siyang (0491 1835 2254) ] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Dec (XINHUA) -- How do we reform the 
current personnel work, which is closely related to the masses' 
interests? A national meeting of the directors of personnel 
departments and bureaus which opened today reached this common 
understanding: Closely revolving around the central task of 
economic construction, we should broaden the scope of reform, 
quicken the pace of reform, and gradually establish a personnel 
management system that is in line with the socialist market 
economic system. 
  It has been learned: relatively big progress has been made 
in 
the country's personnel work in 1993 -- structural reform has 
entered the implementation stage from the stage of study and 
discussion; the public service system has gradually proceeded 
from experimentation to implementation, and work on hiring 
through taking examinations and on giving rewards and imposing 
punishments based on one's work performance has been carried out 
in a planned way; reform of the personnel system of enterprises 
and institutions has been speeded up and in-depth study of the 
classified personnel management system is being conducted; the 
reform plan and implementation rules for the new wage system for 
government organs and institutions have been issued to all units 
concerned; the personnel market has developed quite rapidly and 
reasonable personnel flow has begun to take place; reform of the 
job title system, promotion of outstanding middle-aged and young 
experts, the issuance of special government allowances, and 
other related measures have further rallied the enthusiasm and 
creativity of professional and technical workers; and the task 
of resettling demobilized military cadres has been smoothly 
accomplished. 
  To develop as soon as possible a personnel management system 
that is in line with the socialist market economic system, the 
Personnel Ministry set forth the following primary tasks for 
1994: to ensure the establishment and institution of the state's 
public service system; to properly build up a new wage system 
and to put it into operation; to ensure a good job in the 
initiating and experimentation of the reform of the insurance 
system of government organs and institutions; to further build 
up the force of professional and technical workers, to 
strengthen the management of them, and to improve the service 
for them; to actively cultivate and develop personnel market 
mechanisms; and to step up the establishment of laws and 
regulations governing personnel affairs. 
  State Councilor Li Guixian attended the meeting and gave a 
speech focusing on establishing and promoting the public service 
system. He said: The establishment and institution of the 
state's public service system is a major event in China's 
political life and a basic requirement for deepening the reform 
of the economic system and for building a socialist market 
economic system. 
  Li Guixian said the establishment and institution of the 
state's public service system is the focus of the current 
efforts to quicken the pace of reforming the personnel system. 
He called for initially establishing the public service system 
next year in all departments of the State Council and in the 
organs of the majority of provincial-level governments and 
governments of cities with provincial-level economic powers to 
lay a solid foundation for initially establishing the public 
service system across the country in the following three years 
or a little more time. 
  At the meeting, Minister of Personnel Song Defu made a 
report 
entitled "Broaden the Scope of Reform, Quicken the Pace of 
Reform, and Establish a Personnel Management System That is in 
Line With the Socialist Market Economic System." In his report, 
Song Defu set forth a new idea for reforming the personnel 
system -- establishing a categorized personnel management 
system, a scientific and reasonable wage distribution system, 
social insurance systems at various levels, macro personnel 
management systems at various levels, a personnel market system, 
and a system of personnel laws and regulations, and work to 
refine these systems.

  [Text] According to sources in Shenzhen, former state 
president Yang Shangkun went south for the holidays and arrived 
in Shenzhen on Sunday [9 January]. 
  The last time Yang Shangkun -- who is in his 80's -- went to 
Shenzhen was in the spring of 1992, when he accompanied Deng 
Xiaoping. This time, he came to Shenzhen on a private visit for 
vacation and rest, as he has retired from the office of state 
president. 
  According to people who met Yang Shangkun today, although he 
is an old man of over 80 years, Yang still looked healthy and 
strong and could walk steadily and talk cheerfully and 
humorously.

  [Text] Former Chinese president Yang Shangkun has called 
for strengthening the prestige of the third generation leaders 
in China during his recent meetings with Guangdong senior party 
cadres and army officials, mainland sources have said. 
  Yang told the leading officials in the southern province 
that 
it was important to maintain unity in the process of 
transferring power to the third generation leadership. 
  The 86-year-old party elder is now in Shenzhen Special 
Economic Zone after visiting Guangzhou a few days ago, according 
to the sources. 
  In his talks to provincial party leaders of Guangdong and 
heads of the Guangzhou Military Command Area, Yang also gave his 
support to the current economic reforms in the country, sources 
said yesterday. 
  Yang, however, warned against any social instability 
triggered off by the reforms. 
  Some mainland analysts said Yang's trip and remarks were 
likely an attempt by the party elder to strengthen his political 
influence after he was forced to the sidelines by paramount 
leader Deng Xiaoping. 
  The retired Chinese president has been tipped to be the 
political strongman in China after the 89-year-old Deng dies. 
  Deng is said to be in Shanghai and in good health. 
  Analysts said Yang's meeting with military officials 
demonstrated that he still had good relationships with the army 
although he no longer held actual power. 
  The pro-Beijing Wen Wei Po in Hong Kong yesterday reported 
that Yang arrived Shenzhen on Saturday for "private visit and 
vacation". 
  Yang was said to show "robust health, a firm step and lively 
conversation" despite his old age. 
  The newspaper failed to give details of Yang's trip. 
  In the spring of 1992, Yang accompanied Deng in the 
paramount 
leader's landmark tour to Shenzhen during which Deng called for 
faster reform and opening. 
  The two life-long aides, however, split later that year. 
  This was apparently due to Deng's move in stripping Yang and 
his half brother Yang Baibing from their military positions. 
  Last March Yang Shangkun stepped down from the state 
presidency, officially ending his front stage role in China's 
political arena. 
  Yang's visit to Shenzhen and Zhuhai added speculation that 
his rift with Deng had widened as he did not spend his new year 
holiday with the patriarch in Shanghai. 
  However, there were reports the two elders ended their feud 
after Deng showed personal concern for Yang's health. 
  Meanwhile, other sources said that relevant departments in 
Guangdong had been told to get ready for the arrival of Deng at 
any time. 
  Sources said Deng had considered a visit to Guangzhou as his 
family urged him to do so for the sake of his health. 
  Deng's family was said to have considered the weather in 
Shanghai too cold for the patriarch. 
  It was understood that Guangdong officials hoped the supreme 
leader would visit the province, making it another major centre 
of development aside from Shanghai.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Dec (XINHUA) -- It was learned from the 
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Ministry of 
Supervision that, to promote the in-depth development of the 
anticorruption struggle, the party Central Committee selected a 
number of responsible cadres and staff members from units 
directly under the party Central Committee and the State 
Council, the National People's Congress, the National Committee 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the 
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Supreme 
People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and 
organized them into 20 investigation groups together with a 
number of responsible persons from democratic parties and 
democratic personages without party affiliation. The 20 
investigation groups were dispatched to 20 ministries and 
commissions and 20 provinces and municipalities to supervise and 
inspect the situation of the current anticorruption struggle. 
Generally speaking, since the party Central Committee set the 
three major tasks for anticorruption struggle in the latter part 
of August this year, various localities and departments have 
taken prompt action and adopted effective measures for the work 
and achieved certain achievements in the anticorruption 
struggle. Recently, the central authorities held several report 
meetings to hear the results of checking by those investigation 
groups. Wei Jianxing, Ren Jianxin, Luo Gan, Li Guixian and 
Zhang Siqing, as well as several responsible comrades of 
concerned departments, heard reports by those investigation 
groups. 
  In line with the requirements of the party Central 
Committee, 
various investigation groups integrated the work of supervision 
and inspection with investigation and study to promote the 
in-depth struggle against corruption. Members of those 
investigation groups carefully listened to reports by leading 
members of concerned ministries, commissions, provinces and 
municipalities and exchanged opinions with them. Meanwhile, 
they also spent quite some time hearing opinions and comments 
from cadres and masses on the anticorruption work. Judging from 
the reports made by those investigation groups, in the past four 
months, the whole party has taken part in tackling the problem 
of corruption under the leadership of the party Central 
Committee with the active support of the masses, and thus the 
stuggule has had a good beginning. The tendencies of corruption 
have basically been checked and the three anticorruption tasks 
have achieved good results to various extents in different 
localities and departments. Leading cadres at various levels 
have paid good attention to their behavior through self- 
inspection and self-correction, and have improved the party's 
workstyle and enhanced the consciousness of building an honest 
government. Leading cadres have strengthened their efforts to 
investigate various cases and completed the handling of a number 
of major and serious cases. They have announced and 
straightened out some fees which should not be levied in a 
wanton manner. The unhealthy tendency of using public funds for 
pleasure trips abroad has, in the main, been stopped. In light 
of the dissatisfaction reflected by the masses, some departments 
and trades paid attention to correcting serious unhealthy 
practices. Through anticorruption struggles launched over the 
past several months, the broad masses of cadres and people have 
enhanced their confidence in the anticorruption struggle and are 
convinced that, as long as the struggle can be waged in a solid 
manner in accordance with the demands set by the party Central 
Committee, the tendencies of corruption can certainly be 
gradually curbed, and better and more apparent results can be 
achieved in improving party's workstyle and building an honest 
government. In this way, reform, opening up, and economic 
construction can also be promoted smoothly in a better way. 
  Judging from the situation learned from the investigations, 
there is still a lot of work to do to reach the target of the 
anticorruption struggle. In some localities and departments, 
leadership over the struggle is not strong enough, and so 
progress has been slow and results are not apparent. The 
progress is also uneven in various localities. In some 
localities and departments, leading cadres are not serious 
enough in self-discipline and they have not corrected problems 
found in their self-examination. The task of investigating and 
handling major and serious cases is still very heavy and the 
unhealthy practices reflected by the masses still have not been 
corrected by some trades. In short, we must make great efforts 
to understand the situation, improve our work, and adopt and 
implement correct policies to solve problems. 
  Through investigation, we can understand that to achieve 
signifcant results in the current anticorruption struggle, we 
must do solid work and make greater efforts in the more than one 
month period before the Spring Festival. Meanwhile, it is 
necessary to integrate the anticorruption struggle with the work 
of promoting clean and honest practices during the New Year and 
Spring Festival periods so as to further consolidate and develop 
the achievements gained in the earlier period. 
  The participants in the report meeting held that inspection, 
supervision, and investigation by the investigation group in 
various localities and departments are important measures to 
promote in- depth development of the struggle. The 
participation in investigation groups by people of various 
circles is also a successful experience.

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan (XINHUA) -- RENMIN RIBAO today 
publishes a commentator's article, entitled: "Do More Practical 
Things and Less Empty Talk -- the Third Discussion on Having a 
New Style of Work in the New Year." 
  The article says: Doing more practical things and less empty 
talk is another important content of Comrade Jiang Zemin's 
emphasis on improving leadership style. To advocate doing more 
practical things and less empty talk means that leading cadres 
at all levels should set an example and lead the broad masses in 
doing practical things and solid work to contribute to the 
promotion of reform, opening up, and modernization; and they 
should prevent and overcome such bad work style as indulging in 
exaggerations, performing only lip service and no actual deeds, 
practicing formalism and seeking only a pretty appearance. 
  The article says: What is the most practical thing at 
present which we should go all out to do well? It is to 
accelerate reform and development. The decision of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has drawn a 
blueprint for us to establish a socialist market economy. In 
accordance with the guidelines of the "decision," the central 
authorities this year are promulgating measures to reform the 
management systems of finance and taxation, banking, foreign 
trade, investment, and planning; and all localities are actively 
organizing the implementation of the measures. During the 
course of reform and development, we certainly will encounter 
new contradictions and new difficulties. Our cadres at all 
levels must rack their brains and do down-to-earth work to solve 
all the contradictions and difficulties and to implement all the 
central authorities's measures for accelerating reform and 
development. 
  The article says: During the course of doing practical 
things, we should correctly understand and handle the 
relationship between doing practical things and making 
administrative achievements. We should be concerned about the 
masses' hardships and solve difficult problems for them. While 
the purpose of our party is to serve the people wholeheartedly, 
the objective of reform and development is to give the people an 
even happier life. Leading cadres at all levels should 
constantly keep in mind the broad masses' well-being, discover 
problems in good time, and solve them without delay. Only in 
this way can the masses' enthusiasm be protected, can the masses 
be mobilized to the maximum extent and actively participate in 
and support the reform, and can a stable social and political 
environment for reform and development be created. To do more 
practical things, we should display a spirit of hard struggle as 
well as a scientific and realistic spirit. We should conduct 
scientific appraisal and make policy decisions scientifically on 
the basis of investigation and study. We should strive to 
reduce minor slip-ups and avoid major mistakes so that each and 
every practical thing will yield the best economic returns and 
social benefits. 
  In conclusion, the article says: Since the start of reform 
and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has consistently 
emphasized the necessity for leading cadres to display a good 
style of work. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently has more than once 
called on leading cadres at all levels to do more studying and 
engage in less social intercourse, to conduct more investigation 
and research and make less subjective decisions, and to do more 
practical things and indulge in less empty talk. These three 
points are the extremely important contents of the way to 
improve leadership style. As the new year has just begun, may 
the leading comrades at all levels display the good work style 
of doing more studying, conducting more investigation and 
research, and doing more practical things, and do an even better 
job in uniting and leading the broad masses in forging ahead.

  [Text] China's dissidents-turned-businessmen are facing 
close surveillance by secret police while they catch up with the 
tide of running profit-making ventures. 
  And state-linked businesses have been ordered to sever ties 
with dissidents, Chinese sources told The Standard yesterday. 
  Dissidents believe the authorities feared that greater 
economic capabilities would enable them to expand political 
activities. 
  A dissident whose business was affected by police actions 
complained: "It is more difficult for us to run a business, not 
only because of the austerity measures, but also the disturbance 
created by the secret police." 
  Sources said that Jia Chunwang, head of the Ministry of 
State 
Security, recently asked Song Jian, chairman of the State 
Science and Technology Commission, to keep the commission's 
subordinate enterprises away from the dissident businesses. 
  A dissident, who was jailed for almost a year after the 1989 
Tiananmen Square military crackdown, had signed a contract with 
an enterprise under the commission on the exploration of a land 
development. 
  Under the Security Ministry's intervention, the plan was 
frustrated and his company plunged into difficulties. 
  A press conference planned by the dissident about his 
business plan was barred a few months ago as the police stopped 
a Beijing hotel from renting a room to him to hold the function. 
  Released veteran dissident Wang Xizhe, who opened a 
jewellery 
shop in Guangzhou over the weekend, was annoyed by police 
interference in his business. 
  "I am a businessman, not a dissident any more. Why should my 
clients be questioned by the police," Wang asked. 
  He said a Sichuan businessman who had planned to set up a 
joint venture with him was taken in by police for questioning. 
  Wang was sent to Zhuhai by police last July when he was 
about 
to meet an American businessman introduced by John Kamm, an 
American working on China's human rights issue. 
  Wang claimed that police action had already affected his 
business.

<F P=106> [By Ella Lee from Guangzhou: "In His New Jewellery Shop, </F>
Political Dissident Wang Xizhe Looks Back on His Past--and To 
the Future] 
  [Text] Wang Xizhe was entertaining guests in a new 
jewellery shop in Guangzhou--but the golden surroundings 
couldn't obscure his political charisma. 
  His partners in the new shop wore suits and Rolexes--but 
Wang's low-profile blue jacket and unassuming black slacks made 
him the most eye-catching man in the shop. 
  Deputy-manager Wang's other identity is that he is one of 
the 
most prominent political dissidents in China, well-known 
throughout the country and the world. 
  Almost a year after his 12-year prison term in Guangzhou 
Huaiji prison came to an end last February, Wang joined an old 
friend's company and opened the jewellery business. 
  Wang, 46, was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment in 1981 
for 
"engaging in counterrevolutionary incitement". 
  He had also been jailed from 1977 to 1979 after taking part 
in a wall poster campaign in Guangzhou on socialist democracy 
and the rule of law. 
  With his full head of white hair now dyed black, Wang looks 
10 years younger than he did after his release. 
  Looking at the $20 million worth of jewellery on display, 
Wang looked puzzled. 
  "I am not familiar with this business but I will try hard to 
learn," he said. 
  Wang said business was a practical way to promote the 
country's economic development: "The democratic movement 
doesn't necessarily mean you have to go out in the streets. It 
is something you have to do practically for the society," he 
said. 
  Starting a business is sure to be a rocky road for a 
political dissident in China, and Wang knows that well. 
  After his release from jail, where he was spared the abuse 
other political prisoners received from fellow inmates, the 
Chinese government did not allow him to start a business. 
  But an incident in July last year altered that, and the 
government changed its tune. 
  Wang had to abort an interview with an American trader 
because police, keen to prevent the contact, "invited" him on a 
one-day sightseeing jaunt to Zhuhai. 
  "I was so upset about this incident--I told the government 
that I needed my own business for my living," Wang said. 
  "I told them if they did not give me permission, I would 
rather go back to prison or have my meals in the police 
station," he added. 
  Now, every week when Wang goes to the police station to 
fulfil his parole requirements, police officers never forget to 
bless him in the hope that he "earns a fortune". 
  Wang secretly started a trading company in June last year, 
registering the business under a friend's name to conceal it 
from the government. 
  At that time, Wang only had a few pennies and had to borrow 
$400,000 through connections. 
  The trading company is now a going concern. 
  "I hope my efforts to earn a better living will be a kind of 
compensation for my family," Wang said. 
  "My wife and son lived in hardship during my imprisonment 
and 
I feel I owe them a lot--a lot," Wang said. 
  At first, Wang's label as a political dissident was a 
barrier. 
  Early last year, he planned to open a bookstore with some 
friends but they later refused to co-operate. 
  "I understand some people's fears that my special identity 
might bring them trouble from the authorities, where good 
relations are of the highest importance," he said. 
  His aspiration is to open a bookstore selling history and 
political texts--a way to "educate the grassroots to know more 
about their country and the world". 
  He said his current business was not a lifelong career but 
just a foundation to finance future political activities. 
  "I will never give up my life mission to write political 
articles," Wang said. 
  "But it is not an appropriate time for me to do that because 
I don't feel free to publicise my political thinking during my 
parole period. Also, I have to wait for my political rights to 
be reinstated," Wang said. 
  "If I can only write with reservations, I would rather not 
do 
it at all. It would be meaningless." 
  Wang's parole will be complete by April 1995. He will be 
denied his political rights for four and a half years after that. 
  He is now living under close government surveillance. 
  "I am told not to leave Guangzhou, not to write political 
articles and not to talk to the media. But I only follow the 
first rule," he said. 
  Right after his release from jail, Wang planned to visit the 
United States on his first overseas trip. 
  But he changed his mind after considering the possible 
effects. 
  "It is so easy for the government to arrest you for making 
contact with other dissidents there," he said. 
  "Or they might not let you back (to Guangzhou) once you are 
out, like they did to Han Dongfang." 
  He has also avoided going to other provinces. 
  Wang said that, for the time being, he planned to keep his 
distance from other political dissidents and human rights groups. 
  "I don't want to have an open conflict with the authorities, 
which will hinder both my business and my future political 
activities." 
  Looking back on his 14 years behind bars, Wang proudly says 
he feels no guilt or regret. 
  "I was not a democratic fighter, I am just an ordinary man 
who did something good for my country." 
  Wang has been struggling to clear his name as a criminal, 
and 
has put forward his appeals to the high court 44 times. 
  Last year, Wang asked Cheng Yiu-tong, Hong Kong 
representative of the National People's Congress, to take 
letters to the congress but so far he has not received a single 
reply. 
  Enduring the ordeal in prison, Wang refused to plead guilty 
even though he was told it could be a trade-off for his release. 
  "I don't blame other people who pleaded guilty in order to 
get out of the prison to fight other political battles," he said. 
  "China is still a country not ruled by laws but by people," 
he said. "Even development of human rights is faster than 
before-- people's rights are not stated in laws."

  [Text] Lhasa, January 8 (XINHUA) -- China's five autonomous 
regions for minority nationalities have given priority to 
training and promotion of minority nationality cadres. 
  The five autonomous regions of Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner 
Mongolia, Guangxi and Ningxia have taken various measures to 
help raise the work level of minority nationality cadres. 
  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region in Northwest China has sent 
ethnic cadres to coastal developed areas to learn and at the 
same time invited technicians and scientists from elsewhere to 
give lectures on management and technical know-how. Such 
cooperative relations have been set up between cities and 
counties of Xinjiang and those in coastal areas. 
  Since 1980, Tibet autonomous region has held various courses 
to train a total of 27,363 cadres of minority nationalities, 
72.75 percent of the total of trainees in the region. 
  Training of county-level leaders has always been stressed in 
Tibet. 
  Each year, Tibet sends ethnic management and technical 
leaders for additional study in related universities and 
colleges with support from the central government and other 
provinces. 
  Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous 
Region and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have also achieved 
progress in the work. 
  Inner Mongolia has given special attention to training and 
promotion of ethnic cadres of its three autonomous banners 
(counties) and over ten autonomous townships. 
  Guangxi stressed a relationship of mutual respect and help 
between local cadres of the Han and other nationalities.

  [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- Taiwan authorities 
are urged to stop placing any political barriers in the way of 
repatriating hijackers in a XINHUA commentary here today. 
  On December 18 to 22 last year, the Association for 
Relations 
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) on the Chinese Mainland and 
the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) held working 
talks in Taibei [Taipei]. 
  The working talks attained positive results, including the 
consensus that in principle hijackers must be repatriated, the 
commentary says. 
  However, the SEF issued a statement on December 22 saying, 
that although the ARATS eagerly wants to have the hijackers 
repatriated, it is not willing to face up to the "equal judicial 
jurisdiction entitled to our side." 
  Originally, the discussions between the ARATS and the SEF 
were aimed at seeking practical and realistic measures 
acceptable to the two sides to solve concrete problems in the 
people-to-people contacts across the straits, considering that 
political differences exist between the two sides across the 
straits. 
  The ARATS has reaffirmed that the political differences 
between the two sides should not become an obstacle to 
consultations between the two organizations. 
  Many times the ARATS has put forward practical and realistic 
and rational suggestions for seeking ways to reach an agreement. 
  However, the Taiwan authorities called the suggestions 
"defying the equal judicial jurisdiction entitled to Taiwan" and 
refused to accept them. 
  It should be pointed out that, under the present situation 
in 
which political differences between the two sides can not be 
resolved at once, the practical way to solve the repatriation of 
hijackers and other issues is to avoid sensitive political 
problems and take a positive and realistic attitude to seek 
measures for resolving the issues, which can be accepted by both 
sides, within the scope of discussions of the two organizations. 
  The issue of judicial jurisdiction is essentially a 
political 
one, the commentary says. The Taiwan authorities' sticking to 
the so-called "equal judicial jurisdiction" or "reciprocal right 
to the judicial administration" during the routine business 
talks of mass organizations is a covert attempt to create "two 
Chinas" and will never work. 
  The "Wang-Ku" meeting concluded agreements and the two 
organizations have made progress in routine talks, thus paving 
the way for solving concrete problems in contacts among 
compatriots on both sides of the straits. 
  To better prevent the criminal offense of hijacking, the 
civil aviation departments on the mainland have strengthened 
safety examinations. 
  Naturally, the Taiwan authorities should adopt necessary 
measures to cooperate in settling the issue of a handful of 
evil-doers hijacking passenger planes to Taiwan, the commentary 
says.

  This is the theme of an ongoing symposium which opened here 
today. 
  The three-day symposium is jointly sponsored by the 
Development Research Center under the State Council, the XINHUA 
Daily Telegraph of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and the city government. 
  More than 130 government leaders, scholars and specialists 
from central and local government institutions are taking part 
in the symposium. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, who has just made an 
inspection tour here, also attended the opening of the symposium 
and spoke at the meeting. 
  The participants were told that the city has made great 
progress in the drive for economic development and opening to 
the outside world over the past few years. 
  And a new world trade center for northeast Asia has taken 
initial shape here. 
  A top local official told XINHUA reporters that the city is 
in the center of the northeast Asian economic circle and has a 
close bearing on the economic ties and co-operation among the 
different sectors of the circle. 
  In addition, he said, being an important heavy industrial 
base, it is also showing powerful comprehensive economic 
strength, with developed commerce, and fast and convenient 
transportation and telecommunications linking it to over 300 
cities and regions throughout the world. 
  The city has now established economic co-operation and trade 
ties with more than 100 countries and regions worldwide, 
including the United States, Japan and Canada, the official said.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- At its third meeting 
today, the political affairs group of the Preliminary Working 
Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [SAR] discussed the termination of the 
last term of the Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco], two 
municipal councils, and district boards. 
  It is reported that members of the committee held that, 
according to the stipulations of the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, the PRC will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 
July 1997 and the British Government will return Hong Kong to 
the PRC on the same day. This means that British rule over Hong 
Kong will end on 30 June 1997. Prior to this, the British 
Government is using two constitutional documents, "Letters 
Patent" and "Royal Instructions," as legal grounds for its rule 
over Hong Kong. It rules Hong Kong specifically through a 
political structure composed of the Legislative Council, two 
municipal councils, and district boards. The British Hong Kong 
political structure is an overall reflection of the British rule 
over Hong Kong. With the termination of British rule over Hong 
Kong, the two constitutional documents that hold its power 
together will definitely be abolished, that is, the legal 
grounds will disappear. This signifies that the original 
British Hong Kong political structure that rules Hong Kong will 
of course terminate concurrently. British rule over Hong Kong 
can neither be extended beyond 30 June 1997, nor can it be 
allowed to make any decisions to let the existing political 
structure do so. Otherwise, it will be considered to have 
overstepped its power, and the principle of sovereignty 
stipulated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic 
Law will be meaningless. If such were the case, it would be the 
same as extending British rule beyond 1 July 1997, which is 
absolutely impossible. 
  According to the abovementioned principle, council members 
of 
the last term of the three-tier political structure under the 
British Hong Kong Government can only serve until 30 June 1997. 
However, current relevant laws of the British Hong Kong 
Government specify that all the terms for council members under 
the three-tier political structure are four years. Members of 
the committee felt that this clearly contravenes the 
abovementioned principle, and therefore is definitely invalid. 
The day when China resumes its sovereignty over Hong Kong, 1 
July 1997, is also the time of the termination of the existing 
British Hong Kong political structure. This is also a justified 
and inevitable outcome when Britain returns Hong Kong to the PRC 
and the Chinese Government resumes its sovereignty over Hong 
Kong. This is the duty the British Government should fulfill 
and a right the Chinese Government should exercise, as 
stipulated in the Joint Declaration. 
  Members of the committee pointed out that the first 
legislative body and district organizations of the Hong Kong SAR 
established after 1 July 1997 will be completely different in 
nature from the political structure of the British Hong Kong 
Government prior to 1 July 1997. It will not be a "complete 
copy" of the original British Hong Kong political structure, but 
one that will be established in accordance with the Hong Kong 
SAR Basic Law and relevant decisions of the National People's 
Congress [NPC]. It will be a political structure that embodies 
the Chinese Government's resumption of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong, and shows that Hong Kong is run by its residents and 
enjoys a high degree of autonomy. 
  The status, power, and organization of the legislative body 
of the Hong Kong SAR will differ greatly from the Legco, which 
acts as a British Hong Kong consultative organization. The 
Basic Law and relevant decisions of the NPC on procedures for 
establishing the first government and legislative body of the 
Hong Kong SAR have specified conditions and confirmation 
procedures for council members to ride on the "through train." 
The Chinese Government had hoped that China and Britain would 
make arrangements for a smooth transition for members of the 
last term of the British Hong Kong Legco through consultations. 
However, as China and Britain could not reach an agreement on 
Hong Kong's 1994/1995 election arrangements in their talks, 
conditions for the transition of council members no longer 
exist. Members of the committee pointed out that the two 
legislative institutions, different in nature, cannot be lumped 
together, even if there had been an agreement between China and 
Britain on arrangements for transition. Nor is it because of 
the absence of an agreement that the current issue of the 
different nature of the two legislative institutions has 
emerged. As mentioned earlier, it is the different legal grounds 
that decide the different nature of the two legislative 
institutions. 
  Members of the committee also pointed out that as component 
parts of the British Hong Kong Government political structure, 
the district boards and two municipal councils of Hong Kong are 
closely connected to the administrative power of the British 
Hong Kong Government. Therefore, as with Legco, the last term 
of the district boards and two municipal councils of the British 
Hong Kong Government will inevitably be terminated on 30 June 
1997. If the regional organizations are not of an 
administrative nature, they certainly may transit to the Hong 
Kong SAR and all they need is an agreement between China and 
Britain. However, for reasons known to all, China is unable to 
realize this wish.

"Deng Is Reported To Make Another Southern Tour"] 
  [Text] It is approaching the Lunar New Year, and people 
are inclined to guess the whereabouts of Deng Xiaoping, China's 
supreme leader, who has retired behind the scenes. The recent 
talk of the town in Guangzhou was that Deng Xiaoping would make 
another "southern tour," and spend the spring festival in 
Guangzhou instead of Shanghai as is the usual practice. 
  A renowned expert, who has familiar knowledge of Beijing's 
political and economic situation, stated that China had already 
pushed the market economic reform in a comprehensive way in line 
with Deng Xiaoping's line of thought. However, because relevant 
plans have involved interest redistribution, extremely great 
differences remained inside the CPC, with intensified interest 
contradiction between the central authorities and localities. 
Deng Xiaoping recently said that he would stand up and speak 
his mind. 
  Aside from paying attention to various step-by-step reforms 
that have already been pushed, Deng has also shown great concern 
for the issue of inflation. Some reports indicate that Deng 
made a few points about the grain price rise that took place 
toward the end of last year. He said that the matter showed 
that the mass mentality remained comparative fragile; he 
required governments at various levels to pay attention to 
issues of a universal nature surfacing in the course of reform 
as well as people's tolerance; at the same time, he praised the 
central authorities for adopting prompt measures to stabilize 
grain prices, saying that the action was an expression of the 
collective leadership's maturity. 
  Deng's remarks have once again backed Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji. Not long ago, cadres in China studied Zhu Rongji's 
recent speech delivered at a CPPCC meeting. In his speech, Zhu 
stressed that differences in thinking inside the party and 
between the central authorities and localities remained 
regarding issues of reform, while frankly acknowledging that the 
central authorities and he himself were under very great 
pressure. It was learned that some conservative force had 
recently impeded relying of reforms on the issue of inflation. 
While Deng praised the central leadership for its practice, he 
was obviously backing Zhu Rongji. 
  An official of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government 
said that Deng was likely to take advantage of his appearance 
during another southern inspection tour during the Spring 
Festival to air his opinions. Ever since mid-December, news has 
spread that Deng Xiaoping would make another tour of Guangdong. 
The official said Deng southern inspection tour that took place 
at this time in 1991 started a whirlwind of reform across China. 
Today, China has already announced that it would build the 
market economy; in addition, beginning with last July, the 
central authorities have implemented macroeconomic regulation 
and control. In a nutshell, the changes in Guangdong over the 
past two years are worth Deng seeing with his own eyes. Another 
point is that the finance and tax reform to be pushed in 1994 is 
not favorable to coastal developed provinces including 
Guangdong. Should Deng make another southern inspection tour, 
that might play the role of appeasing localities. 
  Last month, Beijing Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa disclosed that he 
accompanied Deng Xiaoping touring Beijing last October. 
Presently, the north has become bitter cold, and Deng Xiaoping 
should already have gone south to avoid the cold weather, or is 
he making plans for another "southern inspection tour?"

<F P=106> [By reporters Xia Zhaolong (1115 0340 7893) and Tan Jianrong </F>
(6151 1696 2837)] 
  [Text] Tokyo, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- Japanese deputy prime 
minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said here today that 
Japan-China ties have entered a new stage. In the coming years, 
it will be imperative to be world-oriented and future-oriented 
and to develop the friendly and cooperative relations between 
the two countries in a more extensive way. 
  Hata made the following comments in an interview with XINHUA 
at the Diet building prior to his visit to China. 
  He said: "We celebrated the 20th anniversary of Japan-China 
diplomatic normalization the year before last. Last year 
witnessed the 15th anniversary of the conclusion of Japan-China 
peace and friendship treaty. Relations between the two 
countries have entered a new stage. 
  Hata pleasantly recalled his visit to China in January 1973. 
He said with deep feeling: "I am very pleased to see that the 
relations between Japan and China have been developed in such an 
extensive and profound way over the past 21 years. I visit 
China every two or three years and every time I am very strongly 
impressed with the fine relations that are increasingly 
developing." 
  He said: In developing Japan-China ties, it is imperative to 
face the future and be conducive to world affairs in the future. 
As far as Japan is concerned, we should not forget to 
introspect the past's history. We should render active support 
to China in its reform and economic development. He continued: 
"A long-term and sustainable economic development in China is of 
vital importance. Now China is striving to build a socialist 
market economy. If it succeeds, it will have a significant 
bearing on the global economic development and on peace and 
stability in Asia and the world at large." 
  Commenting on Japan's economic cooperation with China and 
its 
aid to China, Hata said: It is hoped that China will pay 
attention to environmental protection while developing its 
economy. He said: "China is now upgrading weapons and striving 
to modernize its equipment. I do not believe that China will go 
for a big-military power status." He said that Japan will 
continue to provide aid and support to China in the future. 
  On the question of Japan-Taiwan ties, Hata said: The 
Japanese 
Government has maintained non-official contacts with Taiwan 
since the normalization of diplomatic ties between Japan and 
China. Although there are divergent views on the issue at home, 
the government's principled position is unchanged and it will 
remain so in the future." 
  At the conclusion of his interview, Hata said: Prime 
Minister 
Hosokawa has expressed on many occasions his wishes to visit 
China. When the opportunity arises, he will pay a visit at the 
earliest possible date.

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian 
Qichen said here today that the friendly co-existence between 
China and Japan and their mutually beneficial cooperation 
constitutes an important factor in the maintenance of political 
stability and economic development in the Asia and Pacific 
region. 
  Qian, also China's foreign minister, made this statement in 
talks with Japanese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata here this afternoon, shortly after his arrival here. 
  Hata's China trip at the beginning of the new year would 
promote the development of Sino-Japanese friendly ties of 
cooperation, Qian said. 
  According to Chinese officials present at the talks, Qian 
noted that the past year witnessed the strengthening of 
bilateral friendly ties of cooperation in politics, economy, 
culture, science and technology, and the expanded cooperation in 
all fields between the two countries. 
  The past year also saw new progress of Sino-Japanese 
economic 
and trade cooperation, Qian said. 
  He said that China appreciates the Japanese Government's 
positive attitudes in promoting Sino-Japanese ties and hopes it 
will make efforts to reduce its trade surplus with China. 
  Yet, China always advocates that a positive trade balance 
should be achieved through the expansion of bilateral trade, 
Qian stressed. 
  There exist many favorable factors for the two countries to 
expand their trade ties, Qian said, adding that China's economy 
has embarked on the track of sustained and healthy development 
and it is ready to further expand the current cooperation of 
mutual benefit with the joint efforts of the Japanese side. 
  During the talks, Hata reiterated Japan's continued support 
for China's reform and opening-up policies. 
  The third batch of Japanese Government loans to China would 
be used up by 1995, he said, adding that his country is willing 
to continuously provide this kind of loan so as to facilitate 
the bilateral economic and trade cooperation. 
  The three batches of loans have played a positive role in 
China's economic development, and in the meantime, promoted the 
development of the economic cooperation between the two 
countries, Qian said, adding that the Chinese side appreciates 
the positive attitudes of the Japanese Government on the 
provision of the fourth batch of Japanese Government loans. 
  The two foreign ministers have agreed that specific issues 
concerning the fourth batch of loans should be negotiated by the 
relevant departments of the two countries. 
  Hata also reiterated Japan's support for China's resumption 
of its contracting partner status in the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade (GATT). 
  China is an important country and it is necessary for China 
to re-enter GATT, Hata said, adding that Japan would cooperate 
closely with China in this respect. 
  The two foreign ministers also agreed to strengthen their 
cooperation in the area of environmental protection. They hold 
that this accords with the interests of both sides and 
constitutes an important contribution to the world environmental 
protection as a whole. 
  They supported the idea that the relevant departments of the 
two countries intensify their studies on this issue and try to 
reach an agreement on environmental protection cooperation as 
soon as possible. 
  Both of them agreed that it is of great significance to the 
strengthening of mutual understanding that the two countries 
further develop cultural exchanges. 
  They also agreed that the current Sino-Japanese ties are 
good 
and that to steadily develop their ties, the two sides should 
maintain the momentum of high-level contacts. 
  On the Taiwan issue, Hata reaffirmed that Japan sticks to 
all 
the principles of the Japan-China joint communique and will not 
support the idea of "two Chinas" and will not develop official 
ties with Taiwan. This stance on the Japanese side will not 
change in the future, Hata said. 
  Talking about the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, 
Qian 
said the Chinese Government welcomes the positive progress 
achieved recently through negotiations between the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea and the United States. 
  China hopes that the two sides will cherish this progress, 
continue with their talks and settle this issue properly at an 
early date. 
  Hata also voiced appreciation of the progress on this issue. 
  After the talks, the two sides signed three documents on 
Japan's offer to China a financial assistance, totalling 125 
million yen.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 8 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata Saturday [8 January] told his Chinese counterpart 
Qian Qichen that Japan expects more transparency in Chinese 
military affairs and expects China to play a role in resolving 
the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development, a 
Japanese official said. 
  During two and a half hours of talks, Hata said Japan 
welcomes the recent agreement by the North Koreans to allow some 
inspections, the official said. 
  Qian was quoted as saying China also welcomed the new 
development, adding China expects the problem to be solved 
rapidly in order to keep peace and stability in Northeast Asia, 
he said. 
  Hata, concurrently deputy prime minister, told Qian that 
Japan expects more transparency in China's military development 
and indicated that human rights improvements in China would be 
conducive to better Sino-U.S. relations. 
  The spokesman said Hata, who arrived earlier in the day for 
a 
two-day visit, also took a stand on nuclear weapons 
proliferation and urged China to abide by the Missile Technology 
Control Regime, which aims at preventing proliferation of 
ballistic missile technology. 
  The Chinese side said they would actively participate in a 
total ban on nuclear weapons, a nuclear test ban treaty, the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and would register their 
conventional weapons with the United Nations, he said. 
  Qian, also vice premier, expressed concerns over recent 
relations between Japan and Taiwan. 
  Hata said there would be no change in Japan's policy toward 
Taiwan, and that Japan would continue to abide by the 1972 
Japanese- Chinese Joint Communique in which Japan recognized 
China as sole legitimate government. 
  Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has 
recently sent high-level officials to Taiwan in order to service 
an expected 13 billion dollar trade surplus with the island 
territory in 1993. 
  Qian said Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, known as China's economic 
czar, will visit Japan in February. 
  An invitation was also extended to President Jiang Zemin, 
but 
no date was set, the Japanese official said. 
  Qian strongly requested a visit to China by Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, with the Japanese side expressing hope that a 
visit will be made at an early stage, but no date was fixed, the 
spokesman said. 
  The Japanese side proposed dividing loan periods from five 
years to three-year and two-year periods beginning with the 1996 
fiscal year, with yearly reviews in accordance with the 
principles of the official development assistance, the official 
said. 
  Qian basically accepted the new arrangement, while saying 
China appreciated both Japan's contribution to Chinese economic 
development as well as the new arrangement for the loans. 
  Qian also agreed to yearly reviews of projects involving the 
Japanese loans, the official said. 
  Japan has extended yen-denominated loans to China under 
five- 
and six-year programs since 1979, with 528.2 billion yen loaned 
out in the 1990 to 1995 period covering 42 Chinese projects.

  [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng exchanged views on Sino-Japanese relations and regional 
issues with visiting Japanese Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata here this afternoon. 
  Li said he was pleased with the smooth development of Sino- 
Japanese relations in recent years. 
  "Sino-Japanese relations have made satisfactory achievements 
in every field of communication and cooperation," Li said. 
  "Cooperation in the economy, trade and technology has been 
on 
a track of steady development, with the volume of bilateral 
trade hitting 35 billion U.S. dollars last year, which is a 
result of joint efforts and symbolizes that Sino-Japanese 
relations have entered a new stage," said Premier Li peng. 
  He urged that both countries should exert further efforts to 
keep the momentum going. 
  "With the deepening of China's reform, and the growing of 
China's huge market, the prospects for Sino-Japanese cooperation 
is promising," Li said. 
  Tsutomu Hata arrived in Beijing this afternoon. 
  Li said Hata's two-day official visit to China will 
certainly 
strengthen Sino-Japanese relations. 
  "The purpose of reform is to develop productivity, and 
enhance people's living standard," Li said when briefing Hata on 
China's reform. 
  The years of practice had indicated that China had paid much 
attention to and was able to deal properly with problems arising 
in the process of reform and development, Li said. 
  "Whenever we are to adopt a new measure, we always take into 
consideration the endurance capability of the country, 
enterprises and people," Li said. 
  When talking about the Korean peninsula, Li emphasized that 
China supports the non-nuclear proposal and stability and peace 
there, and hoped the nuclear problem of the peninsula would be 
resolved through negotiations. 
  "We oppose any coercive way or embargo, which will 
inevitably 
make the problem more complicated," Li said. 
  Hata said Japan was satisfied with the current Japan-China 
relations, and expressed admiration for China's rapid economic 
growth. 
  Hata held that China's reforms are of great importance to 
Asia and the Pacific region. 
  Hata told Li that though a new government now ruled in 
Japan, 
the policy of Japan-China friendship will not be changed. 
  Li extended through Hata his invitation for Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa to visit China. 
  Hata said prime minister Hosokawa was looking forward to 
touring China soon. 
  Among those also taking part in the meeting were Deputy 
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and other high Chinese 
and Japanese officials.

  [Text] Beijing, January 9 (XINHUA) -- President Jiang Zemin 
urged Chinese and Japanese leaders to work together to ensure 
the long-term and steady growth of their bilateral ties. 
  Jiang, in an hour-long meeting with visiting Japanese Deputy 
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, noted that 
remarkable progress has been made in promoting the Sino-Japanese 
relations in various fields, due to joint efforts. 
  He recalled his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro 
Hosokawa during the informal APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation] summit in Seattle last November, saying that the 
two leaders reached agreement on many issues. 
  Jiang also stressed that it is very important for the 
Chinese 
and Japanese leaders to take a long-term point of view in 
reviewing and handling Sino-Japanese relations. 
  He said that a steady growth of such relations benefits both 
sides and is also useful to peace and development in the Asia- 
Pacific region and in the world at large. 
  Hata agreed with Jiang's assessment of the Sino-Japanese 
relations, saying that the furtherance of the relations produces 
a positive impact on peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific 
region and in the whole world. 
  He also expressed admiration over China's economic growth 
and 
the successful reform and opening drive. 
  Present at the meeting was Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 9 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, on the last day of a two-day visit to China, 
Sunday [9 January] expressed hopes of further developing 
bilateral relations in a "future-oriented and global context." 
  Speaking before the press following his morning meeting with 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Hata dispelled concerns over 
Japanese-Taiwan relations, while reiterating both a common 
Chinese and Japanese will to resolve the nuclear question on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The foreign minister said he told Chinese leaders that Japan 
would continue to abide by a one-China policy based on 
nongovernmental and economic relations and that Japan would 
continue to abide by the Japan-China joint communique. 
  "For development of China and the development of Asia, we 
cannot deny the development of Taiwan," he said, while welcoming 
the participation of both Taiwan and Hong Kong in the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. 
  "As far as I know, no member of the (Hosokawa) cabinet will 
visit Taiwan, " Hata said 
  Hata asked the Chinese leadership to make use of its 
historical and geographical position to "convey the suspicions 
of the international community concerning nuclear development" 
to North Korean leaders. 
  The Chinese side reiterated its opposition to pressuring or 
placing sanctions on North Korea, he said, but the Chinese 
assured him that they would play a positive role in seeking a 
solution to the nuclear question on the Korean peninsula. 
  Hata felt it was important for China to enter the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade because of its growing economy 
and influence over international trade. 
  Working-level talks between Japan and China for China's 
membership in the world trade body "would begin soon," he said. 
  Hata referred to Japanese-Chinese relations as entering a 
new 
phase after the 20th anniversary of the normalization of 
diplomatic relations in 1992 and the 15th anniversary of the 
signing of the Sino-Japan peace treaty. 
  After his arrival in Beijing Saturday, Hata met with Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Premier Li Peng. 
  In a meeting with Jiang, Hata called on China to make 
efforts for disarmament, saying Japan and other neighboring 
countries are concerned about China's increasing military 
spending, Japanese officials said. 
  The Chinese president said China's military forces are 
designed to only defend China's land and economy, adding that an 
increase in commodity prices was behind the rise in military 
expenditures, according to the officials. 
  Jiang was also quoted as saying that China does not have any 
ambition and will never seek hegemony. 
  The most important issue for the Chinese Government is how 
to 
feed its 1.2 billion people, Jiang added. 
  The two leaders shared the view that Japan and China have 
been playing a pivotal role in the peace and stability of Asia, 
the officials said.

  [Text] Beijing, January 9 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Deputy Prime 
Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata gave a press 
conference here today before winding up his two-day China tour. 
  He told Chinese and foreign reporters that he had 
discussions 
with Chinese leaders on bilateral ties, regional and 
international issues. 
  The two sides also exchanged views on Japan providing new 
government loans to China after 1995, he added. 
  He said that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa takes the 
Japan- China relations as one of the pillars of the Japanese 
Government's foreign policy. 
  In the coming years, he said, the Japanese Government will 
make such relations more forward-looking and more beneficial to 
the world. 
  Meanwhile, Japan will continue to support China's reform and 
open policy, because the policy is of great importance to China, 
to the neighboring countries and even to the whole world, he 
said. 
  To ensure continuous growth of the Sino-Japanese economic 
cooperation and trade, he said, the two sides have agreed to 
make more efforts in improving the environment for the economic 
activities. 
  He described China's drive to build a socialist market 
economy as a "gigantic, historic experiment," and expressed the 
hope that it will succeed. 
  On the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula, he said that 
Japan and China are in complete agreement that there should be 
no nuclear weapons in the peninsula. 
  The participation in international cooperation by Korea, a 
member of the international community, is very important to 
Korea itself and to Northeast Asia as well, he stressed. 
  The two sides have also confirmed that they will, proceeding 
from their respective positions, make efforts to ensure that the 
northern part of Korea will accept the IAEA's [International 
Atomic Energy Agency] inspection and that the North-South 
dialogue will move forward. 
  He said that China, now the world's eleventh largest trading 
power, should regain its seat in the GATT, and Japan will 
continue to support China's endeavors.

<F P=106> [By Robert J. Saiget] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 9 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata's just completed two-day visit to China was short, 
tough and to the point as the two Asian giants patiently lay 
down their cards amid ever-changing roles in Asia's burgeoning 
economic sweepstakes. 
  The theme of Hata's visit this time around was a new era of 
development based on an orientation toward future relations and 
discussed in the context of contributions toward the 
international community, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said. 
  Such a "forward orientation," an obvious way to avoid the 
horrors of times gone by, was carefully balanced by Hata's 
reiteration that Japan would not forget "the self-reflection of 
the past." 
  While the Chinese leadership cordially listened to Hata's 
explanation of developing relations in a global context, they 
remained mum on questions concerning war retribution and refused 
to comment on Japan's ambitions to join the United Nations 
Security Council, the spokesman said. 
  Hata, while sidestepping direct references to the war, told 
the press that "a frank exchange of views is natural to deeper 
relations." 
  He did not, however, say when that exchange of view will 
come 
nor did he speculate on how China will use the "war compensation 
card." 
  China, too, appears to be ready to use Japan's UN ambitions 
to the fullest effect, which in China's case usually means "more 
economic aid." 
  Japan has lent thousands of billions of yen to China through 
its overseas development assistance program and the 
rearrangement in the loan schedules during the visit were 
applauded by both sides. 
  Japan, among developed nations, arguably has the clearest 
understanding of the actual situation in China and is fully 
aware of China's financial situation which remains bogged down 
by the large, backward and underdeveloped regions. 
  Meanwhile bilateral trade relations neared 35 billion 
dollars 
in 1993 to reach a record height, while China continued to call 
for increased investment from Japan. 
  In such a light, the future of Japan-China relations has no 
big change on the horizon -- the Japanese Government will 
continue in its quiet ways to offer support and assistance to 
China's endeavors, while Japanese businesses will take advantage 
of their technology and advanced products to reap the benefits 
of the huge Chinese market.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 8 KYODO -- Premier Li Peng and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen expressed concerns Saturday [8 
January] over recent Japanese-Taiwan relations in meetings with 
Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Hata arrived in Beijing Saturday afternoon for a two-day 
visit and immediately had talks with Qian and Li. 
  In a two-hour meeting with Qian, also a vice premier, Hata 
expressed hopes to further develop relations "in a future 
oriented and global context," a Japanese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said. 
  Replying to Chinese concerns over recent Japanese-Taiwan 
relations, Hata said Japan's one-China policy has not changed, 
as stated in the 1972 Japan-China Joint Communique in which 
Japan recognized China as sole legitimate government, the 
spokesman said. 
  China's concerns are believed to be based on a high-level 
visit to Taiwan by Hiroshi Sakamoto, chief of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry's Industrial Policy Bureau. 
  Japan switched diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing 
in 
1972 and no Japanese cabinet ministers have visited Taiwan, 
which China regards as a renegade province. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Vincent Siew, 
Taiwan's economic minister, exchanged greetings at the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seattle last 
November, the first-ever contact between a Japanese premier and 
a senior Taiwanese official since 1972. 
  Leaders of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a partner in 
Hosokawa's seven-party coalition government, have sought the 
opening of ministerial-level ties between Tokyo and Taipei. 
  Both Hata and Qian expressed satisfaction with North 
Korea's recent agreement to allow international inspections of 
its nuclear facilities, with Hata stressing Japan's expectation 
that China play a positive role to "dispel the doubts of the 
international community" concerning the nuclear program in North 
Korea, the official said. 
  Qian said he expected "the issue to be solved soon" and 
recognized its importance to the "peace and stability of 
Northeast asia," he said. 
  The Japanese foreign minister also told Qian that Japan 
expects more transparency in China's military expenditures, and 
urged him to abide by the Missile Technology Control Regime, 
which aims at preventing proliferation of ballistic missile 
technology. Hata also indicated that human rights improvements 
in China would be conducive to "respect and trust" in the 
international community. 
  Qian reiterated active participation in efforts toward a 
comprehensive ban on nuclear weapons, a nuclear test ban treaty, 
the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and registering 
conventional weapons with the United Nations, the spokesman said. 
  It was agreed that Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, known as a 
reformer and believed to be the main force behind China's 
ambitious economic reform, would visit Japan in February, the 
official said, while Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is hoping 
to visit China as soon as possible. The Chinese side also 
accepted an invitation for President Jiang Zemin to visit Japan. 
  Japan vowed to support China in its efforts to become a 
contracting nation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Concerning a new arrangement for Japanese development loans 
to China, both sides agreed to a new arrangement shortening the 
loan term period from five and six years to a three-year and 
two-year arrangement with yearly reviews of loan projects 
according to the principles of Japan's official development 
assistance (ODA), the spokesman said. 
  Hata later made a courtesy call to Premier Li Peng and 
discussed several issues including the economic situation in 
both countries, the official said. 
  The Japanese foreign minister also went over the principles 
of ODA with the Chinese premier, which stipulate that loans can 
be offered to nonmilitary projects that promote further 
democratization and basic human needs. 
  Japan has agreed to loan China 810 billion yen for the 1990 
to 1995 period, of which 528 billion has already been loaned. 
  Li said Japan and China enjoy a good relationship. He 
praised Japan for its one-China policy towards Taiwan and 
welcomed the new developments on the Korean peninsula, the 
spokesman said. 
  Hata will meet with President Jiang Zemin Sunday, before 
returning to tokyo the same day.

invite Jiang to Seoul. 
  "Chinese economy has developed remarkably because of the 
reform and openness policy of senior leader Deng Xiaoping and 
Jiang," Yi said. 
  Yi proposed to expand cooperation and technology development 
in automobile and electronics between the two countries. 
  Jiang replied that he will visit Seoul if he has a chance 
just as he had promised with President Kim at the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit meeting in Seattle last 
November. 
  Jiang said he had ordered the related ministries to take 
measures to boost cooperation in electronics and automobile with 
South Korea. 
  On the North Korea's nuclear issue, Jiang asserted that a 
peaceful solution is desirable through negotiations of concerned 
parties.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 8 (YONHAP) -- National Assembly 
Speaker Yi Man-sop meets with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on 
Saturday afternoon to discuss ways to resolve the North Korean 
nuclear issue and to boost bilateral political and economic 
cooperation. 
  Yi is to seek Beijing's continuous efforts to stop the North 
Korean nuclear program and its support in realizing a reunion of 
separated families in each side of Korea. 
  He is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Li Peng 
afterward. 
  Earlier in the morning, Deng Pufang, eldest son of paramount 
leader Deng Xiaoping, visited Yi in the Diaoyutai guest house. 
  Deng, chairman of the China Disabled Persons' Federation, 
told Yi he sincerely welcomed him to China on behalf of his 
family and hoped his visit would help to develop bilateral ties. 
  Yi, in return, bade Deng Xiaoping good health and asked his 
son to deliver his greetings. 
  "I'm confident that my visit will be epoch-making in 
bilateral ties. South Korea and China should join forces to 
open up the bright future of the 21st century," Yi said. 
  The aged Deng is said to be resting in southern China with 
his family. His third daughter, Rong, who visited Seoul last 
November to promote a best-selling biography of her father, sent 
a gift to Yi through the foreign committee of the National 
People's Congress. 
  Yi arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a seven-day visit at 
the invitation of his counterpart, Qiao Shi, for the first 
legislative contact between South Korea and China. The 
countries normalized diplomatic ties in August 1992.

  [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said here today that the economies of China and the 
Republic of Korea (ROK) are highly complementary to each other 
and that bilateral cooperation in this regard has bright 
prospects. 
  Li made the remarks at a meeting with Yi Man-sop, speaker of 
ROK's National Assembly, and his party here this afternoon. 
  The Chinese premier extended a warm welcome to Yi, who is 
the 
first speaker of the ROK National Assembly to visit China since 
the two countries established diplomatic relations. 
  He expressed the belief that the visit would play a positive 
role in promoting the development of bilateral ties, mutual 
understanding and cooperation between the two peoples and two 
parliaments. 
  The satisfactory development of bilateral cooperation and 
exchanges in every field was the result of the joint efforts on 
both sides, he said, adding that the two parliaments have also 
done their bit in this respect. 
  He noted that ROK's economy has been developing rapidly and 
that the country has economic and technological advantages of 
its own. 
  China's economy is also growing vigorously and the prospects 
of cooperation between the two countries are bright, he stressed. 
  The Chinese people are now concentrating on their economic 
development at home and pursuing a foreign policy of peace 
abroad, Li said. "We attach special importance to developing 
friendly ties of cooperation with our neighbors," Li noted. 
  On domestic affairs, Li said China's economic growth in the 
past decade resulted from the reform and opening-up policies 
initiated by Deng Xiaoping. 
  "We are going to put forward a series of reform measures in 
the future," he said. These reforms would be active as well as 
sustained and the relations between reform, development and 
stability would be handled properly, he added. 
  Speaking of his visit here, Yi said his delegation had 
extensive contacts and mutual understanding with China's 
National People's Congress (NPC) and other departments. 
  The ROK's National Assembly would play an active role in 
promoting ROK-China ties, Yi noted. 
  "We admire Mr. Deng Xiaoping very much. We have seen with 
our own eyes the great achievements China has made while 
maintaining its stability," Yi told the Chinese premier. 
  Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the NPC's Standing Committee, 
took part in the meeting. 
  This moring, Deng Pufang, president of the China Association 
for the Handicapped, met with Yi at the Diaoyutai State

  [Text] Chinese Premier Comrade Li Peng, while meeting with

said that the Chinese economy has made considerable advances 
over the last decade. This is one of the fruits of Deng 
Xiaoping's policy of reform and openness. 
  Premier Li Peng said that the Chinese people are 
accelerating 
economic construction wholeheartedly. He said that China is 
planning to take a series of important steps this year in terms 
of economic reform, adding that the Chinese reform is positive 
and stable. He said that the Chinese Government is attaching 
great importance to interrelations with reform, development, and 
stability. 
  Premier Li Peng told Speaker Yi Man-sop, who is visiting 
China for the first time, that the economies of China and the 
ROK have the potential to complement each other and that there 
is a great chance for the development of economic and trade 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Speaker Yi Man-sop praised Deng Xiaoping's policy of reform 
and openness highly. He said that he personally witnessed the 
development which China is making, expressing his admiration for 
it. He said that the ROK National Assembly is prepared to spare 
no efforts to develop relations between the ROK and China.

  [Text] Nearly two-thirds of all piracy last year took 
place in the South China Sea, particularly in the area between 
Hong Kong, the Philippines and Hainan Island, according to the 
annual report of the International Maritime Bureau (IMB). 
  Though the number of piracy attacks worldwide dropped from 
115 in 1992 to 103, there was an increase in reports of 
government authorised attacks, particularly prevalent by Chinese 
naval vessels. 
  Eric Ellen, director of the IMB said there was overwhelming 
evidence that the attacks had been carried out by Chinese naval 
vessels. 
  "We have photographs of the vessels, photographs of the 
crews' uniforms, and photographs of the flags being carried." 
  He said that only yesterday he had received notification of 
two more vessels attacked in the South China Sea. 
  The Hong Kong, Luzon and Hainan triangle was the biggest 
area 
of activity according to the report, where a total of 33 attacks 
were reported last year. 
  However, it remains unclear as to whether the attacks were 
officially sanctioned, or were being carried out by criminals 
appropriating the authority of Chinese state organisations. 
  It is believed by the IMB that there may be a link between 
the piracy and Chinese claims over the Spratly Islands, whose 
waters are disputed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan 
and Vietnam. 
  Nevertheless, the report also stated that incidents in the 
area had been reduced since August because of greater protection 
by the Russian authorities of their vessels, which had been the 
biggest victim of the attacks, with 27 last year.

  [Text] Washington, January 6 (XINHUA) -- Two days before 
Bill Clinton's first presidential tour of Europe, the United 
States is drumming up its "partnership for peace" program, a 
go-slow plan for the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO). 
  Washington has refused to extend immediately the 16-nation 
Transatlantic alliance's security umbrella to Central and 
Eastern European nations, but offered verbal solace instead. 
  "The security of the states that lie between Western Europe 
and Russia affects the security of America," said Vice President 
Al Gore in a speech today at the Institute of World Affairs in 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
  But words are far from formal and quick membership in NATO 
that countries such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak 
Republics are desperately seeking. 
  Washington's "partnership for peace" proposal, which Clinton 
will formally present to the NATO summit next week in Brussels, 
Belgium, only gives the applicants a "junior membership." 
  Under the U.S. plan, any Central and Eastern European 
nation, 
including republics of the former Soviet Union, can become a 
"partner for peace" in NATO and participate in military training 
and political cooperation. 
  Polish President Lech Walesa described the Washington 
proposal as "short-sighted and irresponsible." The criticism 
was echoed by other Eastern European leaders. 
  It is unclear whether John Shalikashvili, chairman of the 
U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Madeleine Albright, Washington's 
ambassador to the U.N., will be able to convince the leaders 
when they visit the area, starting today. 
  Shalikashvili and Albright will join Clinton in Prague next 
week in meetings with leaders of the Czech Republic, Poland, 
Hungary and the Slovak Republic. 
  Clinton had planned to deliver the Milwaukee speech himself, 
but his 70-year-old mother's death earlier today prompted the 
change. 
  However, he will depart for Europe Saturday [8 January] 
night 
as scheduled. 
  This will be one of his three planned trips to Europe this 
year. The other two occasions are the celebration of the 50th 
anniversary of D-Day in the Second World War in France and the 
Group of Seven's annual economic summit in Italy.

  [Text] London, January 7 (XINHUA) -- British Prime Minister 
John Major will be meeting U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
Washington in some weeks' time, Major's spokesman announced 
today. 
  The time for Major's second trip to Washington since last 
February has not been set, the spokesman said. 
  However, Major will hold informal talks with Clinton during 
the summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 
Brussels to be held on January 10-11, the spokesman added. 
There, Major will also meet with French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur and Italian Prime Minister Carlo Ciampi. 
  The spokesman said the NATO leaders will make important 
decisions, which will guide NATO's future policy, on: 
  How to develop its relations with Russia, Ukraine and 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe; 
  How to adapt itself in both political and military spheres 
to 
be better able to perform peacekeeping and other peace-support 
missions; 
  And how to accommodate a European defense policy with a 
continuing, viable and "to us extremely important" Transatlantic 
alliance.

  [Text] London, January 7 (XINHUA) -- British officials 
denied today that there has been any proposal which would have 
set a fixed timetable for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) to admit East European countries. 
  However, the Western Alliance has come to the conclusion 
that 
NATO should open up a perspective of eventual extension of its 
membership but not try to determine criteria, timetables or 
candidates. 
  The NATO summit next Monday [19 January] and Tuesday in 
Brussels is expected to approve the partnership for peace plan, 
which offers East European states closer military links with 
NATO but no security guarantee or the full membership they want. 
  All Central and East European countries including Russia 
will 
be invited to join the program which will enable them to develop 
military cooperation individually with NATO. 
  The partnership for peace will take place as part of an 
evolutionary process enabling some of the former Soviet Bloc 
states to become full members of NATO in the future, a British 
Foreign Office official said. 
  It will allow these countries to consult with NATO whenever 
they face a threat. 
  "Such a right of consultation and opportunity for 
consultation is not of course a security guarantee... it is not, 
of course, an automatic obligation on existing NATO members to 
go to war on their behalf but it is an indication of a degree of 
security concern on the part of NATO about these countries," 
said the official. 
  The NATO, faced with complaints from some East European 
countries such as Poland for refusing them early membership and 
opposition to its eastward expansion from Russia, will send a 
signal that it is committed to enhancing security to all those 
countries, including Russia, the official said.

  [Text] Bonn, January 7 (XINHUA) -- German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel said today that the forthcoming NATO summit will 
offer closer cooperation with East European states, but is not 
likely to accept them immediately into the military alliance. 
  Kinkel was speaking to reporters three days before the NATO 
summit meeting in Brussels, which is expected to offer all East 
European states and Russia closer military links through a 
so-called "partnership for peace" program. 
  "What East European countries want now is something they 
cannot get, at least not in the initial phase," Kinkel said. 
  NATO has decided to involve East European states in closer 
bilateral military relations but because of opposition from 
Russia has not agreed to offer them full membership at the 
present time. 
  On Thursday [6 January], Russian President Boris Yeltsin's 
chief spokesman said that NATO's acceptance of East European 
states as full members could wreck reforms in Russia, boost 
extreme nationalism, infuriate the Russian Army and force Moscow 
to set up its own military-political bloc. 
  Germany was one of the first NATO members to back bids for 
membership in NATO from a number of East European states, 
including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and Slovak. 
  Kinkel told the reporters that Germany has done "all it 
could" to bring East European states closer to NATO membership 
but that they were exerting "unrelenting pressure" on Germany to 
persuade NATO to offer them security guarantees.

"Clinton's First Trip to Europe"] 
  [Text] Washington, 7 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO)--On 8 January, 
U.S. President Clinton will depart and begin his first trip to 
Europe since he has taken office in the White House. Clinton 
will first attend the NATO summit meeting in Brussels and will 
then visit Prague and meet with the leaders of the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland. From 12 to 15 January, 
he will visit Moscow and meet Russian President Yeltsin. Then 
he will visit Minsk and meet the leaders of Belarus. Finally, 
he will go to Geneva to meet Syrian President al-Asad. 
  Europe was the focus of U.S. foreign policy for a long time. 
However, in the year since Clinton took office, he has mainly 
paid attention to domestic affairs. In the diplomatic field, in 
addition to attending the G-7 summit in Tokyo, meeting with 
Russian President Yeltsin in Canada, and attending an informal 
meeting with APEC leaders, Clinton has been busy coping with 
regional conflicts and has had no time to deal with European 
affairs. However, it is also a pressing matter to readjust the 
United States' relationship with Europe and with Russia in the 
new post-Cold War situation and thus maintain the United States' 
"leading position" in Europe and the whole world. This is the 
main purpose of Clinton's current visit to Europe. 
  With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the 
Cold War, the precondition for a U.S.-European alliance against 
the Soviet Union did not continue to exist. The dissolution of 
the Warsaw Pact even brought about a deep split in the 
longstanding security ties between the United States and Europe. 
Disagreements over various European security issues, especially 
the function and scope of NATO, increased between the two sides. 
On the issues of settling the conflicts in Bosnia and Somalia, 
the United States could not effectively influence other 
countries. U.S.-European conflicts over economic interests also 
increased, and trade friction between the two sides caused the 
Uruguay Round of trade talks to stagnate for a long time. In 
addition, as the United States attached greater importance to 
the Asia-Pacific region and proposed the establishment of a "New 
Pacific Community," this caused much speculation about a shift 
in the focus of U.S. foreign policy. In such circumstances, 
Clinton's current trip to Europe is aimed at reiterating 
Europe's importance for the United States' global interests and 
emphasizing that the United States will continue to undertake 
its commitments to NATO and will continue to strengthen its 
cooperative relationship with Western Europe in the security 
field, thus maintaining the United States' domination of 
European affairs through NATO. 
  The NATO summit meeting in Brussels will mainly discuss how 
to strengthen security cooperation with the former members of 
the Warsaw Pact. In consideration of their own security 
interests, some East European countries, which were formerly 
members of the Warsaw Pact, are eager to join NATO. Some NATO 
member countries also hold that the "security vacuum" brought 
about by the dissolution of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe 
should be filled in good time and that the East European 
countries should be admitted to NATO. However, Russia is opposed 
to the admittance of the East European nations into NATO. In 
view of Russia's stance, the Clinton administration holds that 
hasty action could endanger NATO's own interests. In addition, 
the victory of the Liberal Democratic Party headed by 
Zhirinovsky in the recent Russian parliamentary election made 
the United States and Europe feel that the rise of nationalist 
sentiment in Russia could weaken the United States' influence in 
Russia and that the situation could become unfavorable to both 
the United States and Europe. Therefore, the United States put 
forth a new proposal on establishing a "partnership for peace" 
with the former members of the Warsaw Pact so that military and 
security cooperation between the West and the East European 
countries will be advanced in a steady, prudent, and gradual 
form and will not agitate Russia excessively. Public opinion 
here holds that Clinton will persuade his NATO allies and the 
East European leaders to accept this proposal during his visit. 
  In the past year, Clinton gave great support to Yeltsin in 
weathering two major political crises inside Russia. It is 
expected that the meeting between the two leaders will be 
focused on how to help Yeltsin maintain the momentum of reform 
after the Russian parliamentary election and to win support from 
the public. At the same time, the two sides will also discuss 
the issue of controlling nuclear weapons and preventing nuclear 
proliferation. 
  Middle East peace will continue to be a key point of U.S. 
foreign policy. When meeting with Syrian President al-Asad in 
Geneva, Clinton will urge him to quicken the pace of 
Syrian-Israeli talks and thus further advance the Middle East 
peace process on the basis of the historic peace agreement 
concluded last year. 
  Public opinion holds that Clinton's visit to Europe at the 
beginning of his second year in office obviously shows that he 
intends to accomplish something in the diplomatic field in order 
to change the Democrat administration's domestic image of being 
"incompetent in foreign affairs."

  [Text] Brussels, January 9 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton has comforted Europeans with clear assurances that 
Europe remains essential to the United States in post-Cold War 
years. 
  Clinton made the pledge at a conference held here on Sunday 
[9 January] after his arrival for a NATO summit starting today. 
  "I have come here today to declare and to demonstrate that 
Europe remains central to the interests of the United States, 
and that we will help to work with our partners in seizing the 
opportunities before us all," he said. 
  The President also talked about a new security for Europe 
and 
promised that the U.S. will be a "strong partner" in building 
that security. 
  "The new security must be found in Europe's integration -- 
an 
integration of security forces, of market economies, of national 
democracies," he said. 
  He pointed out that the new security for Europe needs three 
elements -- military strength and cooperation, greater economic 
vitality, and democratic process in the Central and East 
European countries. The first element is the most important, he 
added. 
  "The Cold War is over, but war itself is not over. It rages 
today not only in distant lands but right here in Europe and the 
former Yugoslavia," said the president. 
  Clinton also stressed the importance of NATO's role in 
providing security for Europe and called for NATO's closer 
cooperation with the former Warsaw Pact countries. 
  He said the partnership for peace, a proposal due to be 
adopted at the NATO summit, will create a framework in which 
former Warsaw Pact member countries and other non-NATO members 
can participate in joint military planning, training, exercises 
and other efforts. 
  But he did not give promise to let them become members of 
NATO.

  [Text] Moscow, January 10 (XINHUA) -- Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk will come here Friday [14 January] for a meeting 
with visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, the presidential press service confirmed today. 
  Yeltsin has formally invited Kravchuk to participate in his 
talks with Clinton, the press service said, adding that this has 
been made possible after the three countries reached an 
understanding on some major issues, including nuclear 
disarmament in Ukraine. 
  However, the Ukrainian president's foreign policy adviser 
Anton Butekyo said earlier on Monday that Kravchuk had not 
decided whether to attend the Moscow summit. 
  Ukraine is the world's third largest nuclear power with some 
1,600 of nuclear war-heads inherited from the former Soviet 
Union. 
  Russia and the United States have been concerned over the 
safety of the nuclear arsenal on the Ukrainian territory. 
  Two days before the trilateral Moscow summit, chairman of 
the 
Belarus Supreme Soviet Stanislav Shushkevich will come for a 
one-on- one meeting with Yeltsin. The talk will focus on the 
nuclear weapons in Belarus, INTERFAX reported. 
  Nuclear issue will also be high on the agenda when President 
Clinton makes a stop-over in Minsk on January 15-16 after the 
NATO summit and his visit to Moscow.

"Clinton Reassesses Europe's Attraction"] 
  [Text] The recent development of events shows that after 
paying attention to Asian affairs in his first year after taking 
office, the U.S. President has begun to shift his eyes to 
Europe again. He went to Brussels on 9 January to attend the 
NATO summit meeting, and thus began his first scheduled trip to 
Europe. The climax of Clinton's European trip will be his 
meeting with Yeltsin between 12 and 15 January. This will be 
Clinton's first visit to Russia after taking office and is aimed 
at enhancing the prestige of the Russian president. 
  The year 1993 was the first year of the Clinton 
administration. With the end of the "Cold War," the military 
threat of the former Soviet Union against the United States also 
came to an end. The global strategy of confrontation with the 
Soviet Union pursued by all post-war U.S. administrations lost 
its significance. The long arms race placed the U.S. economy 
in a predicament. The unemployment rate has stayed at a high 
level for three consecutive years and social problems have piled 
up. From the very beginning, the Clinton administration took 
the reinvigoration of the U.S. economy as its overwhelming task 
and is determined to adjust the country's foreign policy. 
  In recent years, changes have also occurred in Europe's 
strategic position. With the disappearance of a common enemy of 
the United States and Europe, contradictions between the United 
States and Europe have gradually increased. In the economic 
field, with the formation of a large, unified market in Europe, 
conflicts of interest between the two sides of the Atlantic 
Ocean became more prominent. At the same time, a relatively 
stable situation and high-speed economic growth existed in Asia. 
The broad market and huge potential of Asia are very attractive 
to the Clinton administration, which is striving to revitalize 
the U.S. economy. Therefore, after taking office in the White 
House, different from his predecessors, the destination of 
Clinton's first foreign visit was East Asia. 
  However, the end of the Cold War did not mean that Europe 
would have no worries and would enjoy lasting peace. Nuclear 
forces in such former republics of the Soviet Union as Russia 
and Ukraine continue to plague the Western countries. In 
particular, Ukraine still refuses to implement the START 1 
Treaty. In order to guarantee their own security, some former 
members of the Warsaw Pact have applied to join NATO, but the 
United States and other NATO countries hold different opinions 
on this issue. In the former Yugoslavia, civil war continues, 
and this has deeply upset other countries in the Balkan 
region.... When facing new problems on the other side of the 
Atlantic Ocean, the United States cannot be indifferent. 
  The Clinton administration has grounds for slowing its shift 
to Asia. According to some analysts, although the war machine 
of the former Soviet Union has collapsed, financial and 
political problems in Russia and the security of the newly 
established democracies in Eastern Europe has forced Clinton to 
reassess Europe's importance for the United States. Jiatehuofu 
[0502 3676 7202 1133], a foreign policy expert at the Hopkins 
Society in Washington, said: "The world's future lies in Asia, 
and we certainly will not give it up. However, Europe is now in 
trouble, and more and more people feel that NATO should be 
strengthened and take on new tasks." 
  At the beginning of 1994, Clinton's first visit shows that 
Europe has become the focus of his attention, and this also 
indicates that the U.S. Government is making a new adjustment 
to its foreign policy. However, people still need to wait and 
see in order to know how much attraction Clinton will find when 
he turns to look at Europe again. It seems that the European 
countries are not pinning too much hope on the United States' 
"return" to Europe. Johnson, a British MP, recently said in a 
report to the West European Union: "Europe should embark on 
preparations for a future scenario where, once the United States 
bears no commitment to Europe, it should be able to safeguard 
its strategic interests independently."

<F P=106> ["Short commentary" by Zhong Zhou (6988 1558): "An </F>
Irresponsible Move"] 
  [Text] On 6 January, the United States unilaterally 
announced the reduction of China's textile and clothing quotas 
by 25 to 35 percent. This was an unjustifiable move which 
disregarded international and bilateral agreements, and trampled 
on the principles and regulations of the international textile 
agreement. 
  As expressly provided in the Multi-Fiber Agreement, when a 
quota is imposed on any single item of clothing or textiles, the 
quota level must not be lower than that of real exports in the 
previous year and a guarantee must be made that the quota level 
will not be lower than 6 percent of the annual growth rate. The 
U.S. quotas imposed on China not only represent an almost zero 
growth rate, but also the United States unilaterally cut the 
quotas by 25 to 35 percent. This act openly trampled on the 
fundamental code of conduct of the Multi-Fiber Agreement signed 
by China and the United States, which can only indicate that 
the United States does not intend to implement international 
agreements it has signed, but merely asks for implementation by 
other countries. 
  The Uruguay Round of Talks recently reached an agreement 
stipulating that, in the next decade, textile quotas would be 
gradually abolished and GATT rules would be enforced once again. 
The United States was not prepared to reduce restrictions but 
rather imposed many more restrictions on others and implemented 
protectionist measures which obviously ran counter to the 
agreement reached by the Uruguay Round of Talks. 
  As stipulated in Article 8 of the Multi-Fiber Agreement on 
illegal transshipment, if the importer considers that illegal 
transshipment has taken place, it should consult with the 
exporter to seek a solution; and if consultation fails to bear 
fruit, the case should be submitted to the textile supervisory 
organization for settlement. The U.S. move obviously violated 
the procedure prescribed by this article. 
  As a matter of fact, even the U.S. Trade Representative's 
Office had to admit: At present, the U.S. side does not have 
any evidence to prove that a large number of illegal 
transshipments are taking place. The U.S. side arbitrarily took 
unilateral action under these circumstances, showing that its 
aim was not to contain illegal transshipments but to implement 
trade protectionism. 
  As everyone knows, the Chinese side keeps asking for U.S. 
cooperation in establishing an inspection system to jointly 
guard against illegal transshipment. However, the United States 
insisted on unilaterally reducing quotas under these 
circumstances, which shows that it does not have even the most 
rudimentary cooperative manner. 
  The U.S. move severely infringed upon the basic rights 
enjoyed by China in the Multi-Fiber Agreement. If the U.S. side 
does not withdraw this decision and return to the negotiating 
table to jointly seek a solution with which both sides are 
satisfied, the concerned Chinese authorities will have ample 
grounds to submit this issue to the textile supervisory 
organization for adjudication and take corresponding retaliatory 
measures. 
  It is regrettable that the U.S. side took this unilateral 
measure contrary to the spirit of the agreement reached so 
recently by the Uruguay Round of Talks striving to alter the 
content of the textile agreement about which developing 
countries are particularly concerned. The U.S. move runs 
counter to the trend of opposing trade protectionism and 
promoting free trade, which is obviously unjustifiable, 
incompatible with present needs, and irresponsible.

<F P=106> ["Newsletter" by Bei Yue (0554 4766) ] </F>
  [Text] New York, 9 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--U.S. 
industrial and commercial sectors voiced their dissatisfaction 
with the decision to cut quotas unilaterally for Chinese textile 
products, believing that the unilateral U.S. move would cause 
tremendous damage to American consumers and the worry that China 
will retaliate. 
  (Richard Blake), business service director of the U.S.-China 
Trade Commission, believes that the decision will increase 
tension between the two countries and that there is nothing good 
about the decision for U.S.-China trade and economic ties. He 
worries that the unilateral U.S. decision could cost China over 
$1 billion in economic losses; that American agriculture, 
especially the cotton export trade, would be the first to feel 
the impact by becoming a target of Chinese retaliation; and that 
U.S. high technology might not escape unharmed. 
  Chinese textile products and garments are very cheap in the 
U.S. market and are much welcomed by American consumers. U.S. 
statistics show that last year China exported its quota of $4.6 
billion of garments and textile products to the United States. 
Tens of thousands of American consumers will be hurt if the 
United States reduces the Chinese textiles quota. (Rece 
Marlin), chairman of the National Federation of American Retail 
Industry, stated the federation would urge the U.S. Government 
to solve the problem by negotiating with China and he hoped that 
this move was only a negotiating tactic. 
  (Laura Jones), executive chairman of the American Textile 
and 
Garments Import Association, expressed anger at the U.S. 
Government's trade sanctions and threats, seeing this punitive 
move against China as a means to placate the American textile 
industry and their supporters in Congress. Jones worried that 
China might adopt corresponding retaliatory action. 
  Mr. Wu Zheng, vice president of the newly founded U.S.-China 
General Chamber of Commerce, expressed regret at the decision, 
saying that the U.S. decision would affect both U.S.-China trade 
and Hong Kong. He believes that the decision exposes the rise 
of trade protectionism and that the American textile industry is 
a "sunset" industry which is incapable of competing with the 
East. Trade expansion between the United States and China 
benefits both parties and is the current trend. Both sides 
should replace confrontation with talks in order to settle 
differences over textile trade. 
  This move by Washington has had a great impact on 
businessmen 
of Chinese nationality, who play an important role in Sino-U.S. 
textile trade. Peng Choutian, secretary of the American Chinese 
Importer and Exporter Association, said: "The quota is 
insufficient as it is, and is more so now with the drastic cut."

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (XINHUA) -- China and the United 
States should make joint efforts to further improve bilateral 
relations, China's Vice-President Rong Yiren said here today 
when meeting visiting U.S. Senator Daniel K. Akaka. 
  Rong said the development of Sino-U.S. relations is 
important 
to development and world peace, and with so many common 
interests, the differences between the two countries should not 
affect friendship and cooperation. 
  Rong met Akaka, chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee of 
the U.S. Senate, this morning in the Great Hall of the People. 
China's vice-president said that given the two countries's 
complementary economies and great potential for cooperation in 
the field, stronger economic and trade cooperation will benefit 
both sides. 
  "Sino-U.S. relations will see smooth growth if the 
principles 
of seeking common points while preserving differences, and 
equality as well as mutual benefit can be observed," Rong said. 
  Akaka seconded Rong's views, saying that the differences 
should be resolved through peaceful consultations and dialogues, 
and should not damage bilateral trade and economic relations. 
  The issues of human rights and the most-favored-nation (MFN) 
trade status should be separated from each other, the senator 
said, adding that he supported a renewal of China's MFN status. 
  "Different countries hold different ideas on human rights," 
Rong said, and as a developing country, China first stresses the 
right to live and the right to develop. 
  Akaka said that China's stand on human rights will shed 
light 
on this topic for other independent countries. Dialogues and 
consultations on human rights will help promote understanding. 
  Akaka, who is on his fifth visit to China, said his current 
tour impressed him deeply, and he was surprised with China's 
rapid development. 
  He said he would urge more U.S. senators to visit China so 
that they can understand China better. 
  Rong Yiren said that he would welcome more U.S. Congressmen 
in China. 
  Akaka and his party arrived in China on Friday [7 January] 
at 
the invitation of the Chinese Institute of Foreign Affairs. 
They toured Hainan and Shenzhen before heading for Beijing.

  [Text] Nanjing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- Eastern Jiangsu 
Province has become the fourth largest foreign trade port in 
China, according to a top provincial foreign trade official. 
  In 1993, Jiangsu reported an export volume of more than 5.97 
billion U.S. dollars, according to Ye Jian, director of the 
provincial foreign trade and economic cooperation committee. It 
registered imports of more than 2.7 billion U.S. dollars, an 
increase of 72.96 percent. 
  Jiangsu opened a foreign trade port in 1974. Since then its 
export volume has increased from 77 million U.S. dollars to more 
than 5.9 billion U.S. dollars last year, an annual growth rate 
of 25 percent, much higher than its overall economic development 
speed. 
  Jiangsu province has been at the top of the list in China in 
terms of its production scope since the mid-1980s. 
  At present it has more than 60,000 production enterprises, 
which export more than 1,000 kinds of products overseas and 
account for more than 80 percent of the industrial products to 
be sold overseas. 
  To date, more than 80 foreign trade companies have been 
established in the province. 232 production enterprises and 10 
science research institutes and higher schools have obtained 
import and export autonomy, ranking first in China. 
  In addition, foreign funded enterprises have become a major 
source of the province's exports. In 1993, foreign funded 
enterprises reported exports of more than 2.26 billion U.S. 
dollars, about 37.8 percent of the total. 
  Now the province's products have been exported to more than 
130 countries and regions, mainly in the Asia and Pacific region. 
  At the same time, its foreign trade ports and transportation 
system have been developing rapidly. Its foreign trade ports 
now have an annual handling capacity of about 100 million tons.

and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 
They emancipated their minds, forged ahead despite 
difficulties, and scored a victory in the third campaign of the 
effort to tackle key problems in industrial adjustment with 
conscientious efforts. They devoted much energy to enterprise 
reform, structural adjustment, strengthening of management, and 
acceleration of technical transformation, and succeeded in 
maintaining synchronized fast growth of industrial production 
speed and efficiency. 
  The characteristics of industrial production last year are 
as 
follows: First, strenuous efforts were made to implement the 
"Regulations on Converting the Operational Mechanisms of 
State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" and the implementation 
measures made by the provincial authorities. The number of 
joint-stock industrial and commercial companies rose to 26 and 
that of enterprises undergoing reform experiments conducted in 
light of the policies for Chinese- foreign joint ventures 
expanded to 230. There are now 36 standard enterprise groups 
and 110 small state-owned industrial enterprises run by local 
people all over the province. By the end of the third quarter 
of this year [as heard], there were over 33,000 township and 
town enterprises under the cooperative shares system. 
  Second, the internal management of enterprises, energy 
conservation, and cutting down of consumption were strengthened. 
In the industrial and communication sector, an extensive 
production and economy drive was carried out. The rate of 
energy conservation and consumption reduction province-wide was 
about 10 percent. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai-based 
Bank of Communications has taken the lead in extending foreign 
exchange business among city residents, international business 
reported. 
  The local branch of the bank, starting the service on 
December 28, 1993, anchored a total transaction of 500,000 U.S. 
dollars through new year's eve. Resuming on January 4, the 
trading is running smoothly. 
  For each transaction, 300 U.S. dollars or an equal amount of 
other foreign currencies is required. The trading hall is well- 
equipped with a computerized quotation, trading and clearing 
system, flashing the latest exchange rates. 
  Through free trading, clients can make money not only from 
interest differentials, but also from exchange fluctuations. 
  Now Shanghainese have found a way to apply foreign exchange 
in hand, besides depositing the money in the bank. 
  Foreign exchange deposits made by Shanghai citizens are on 
the rise. Figures show that the city had more than one million 
depositors by last February, with foreign exchange totalling 1.3 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  Major sources of the money are Shanghai citizens residing 
overseas and businessmen and students based abroad.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, January 8 (XINHUA) -- Malaysia and 
China can learn from each other in many areas of science and 
technology, said Malaysian Minister of Science, Technology and 
the Environment Law Hieng Ding. 
  He made the remarks to the press after he met with Deng Nan, 
vice chairman of the Chinese State Science and Technology 
Commission at his office here today. 
  "As both of us, China and Malaysia, are developing 
countries, 
we have many areas in which we could learn from each other," Law 
said. 
  He said cooperation can cover many fields as "China is a big 
country and has a lot of scientists" and Malaysia is trying to 
"draw a balance between agriculture and industry" during the 
transition from the past agriculture-based economy. 
  He said he and Deng had "useful and interesting discussions" 
which will be followed by the first joint committee meeting on 
science and technology on Monday. 
  "We have worked out a long agenda", said Law, outlining 
cooperation areas proposed by both sides. 
  By the Malaysian side, he said, they include computer 
integrated manufacturing system, advanced materials, 
micro-electronics, computers and information technology, nuclear 
energy, remote sensing and meteorology. 
  While by the Chinese side, they cover meteorology, standards 
and quality control systems, medicine, medical equipment and 
pharmaceutical development, conservation, management and 
exploitation of marine resources, remote sensing and geological 
information. 
  The meeting is the follow-up of the Memorandum of 
Understanding on Science and Technology Cooperation the two 
governments signed in 1992. 
  Law said Deng expressed China's willingness to take part in 
the international floating science exhibition, a Malaysian 
proposal to be further discussed at the ASEAN science and 
technology ministers' meeting in Manila next month. 
  The six-member delegation led by Deng arrived here last 
night 
on a week-long visit during which they will tour Malacca, Penang 
and Sarawak, and some research institutions such as the 
Standards and Industrial Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM).

<F P=106> [By Xiao Wang] </F>
  [Text] China will take on new markets this year to expand 
its overseas labour and engineering service, a senior official 
said last week. 
  The Middle East, a magnet damaged by the Gulf War, is 
especially promising, said Chen Yongcai, director general of the 
international co-operation department at the Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Co-operation. 
  "We're well prepared to enter the Iraqi market once the 
United Nations' sanctions are called off," he said. 
  There is a strong likelihood the UN will lift economic 
sanctions against Iraq within the year, analysts say. 
  China has had a number of projects in Iraq, some have had to 
be postponed because of the sanctions. 
  And in certain cases, Iraq still owes China money. 
  "We're closely following what is happening with Iraq," Chen 
said, but he declined to give details. 
  China has already regained its presence in Kuwait, which is 
emerging from the scars of the Gulf War. 
  Chen said China's labour and engineering contracts where 
were 
back at pre-Gulf War levels. 
  "We've won bids from Kuwait to build larger petrochemical 
projects," he said. 
  Other big potential markets include South Korea, Japan, 
Sudan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. 
  Chen believed China would get $7.5 billion worth of overseas 
labour and engineering contracts this year, 25 percent more than 
1993. 
  Business turnover would grow 12.5 percent to $4.5 billion. 
  And altogether 190,000 workers would be overseas by the end 
of the year, 30,000 more than 1993. 
  Chen said China would also seek higher-level labour and 
engineering contracts this year, including aircraft maintenance 
and project consultancy and design. 
  In the past, Chinese workers have been engaged mostly in 
infrastructure on construction projects. 
  Chen said China was also considering accepting payment in 
the 
form of oil or oil products from Middle East countries. 
  China had rejected such payment in the past, causing the 
loss 
of many contracts, Chen added. 
  He estimated the value of 1993's overseas labour and 
engineering contracts at $6 billion, 10 percent lower than 1992. 
  But he said actual business turnover would hit $4 billion, 
up 
31 percent. 
  Chen attributed the slide in contract value partly to Sino- 
British disputes over Hong Kong.

  [Text] Jerusalem, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Israeli Minister of 
Industry and Trade Mikha Harish indicated today that Israel 
places great importance and high priority to developing 
relations with China. 
  Interviewed by XINHUA before his visit to China in his Tel 
Aviv office, the minister said the economic and trade relations 
between the two countries have developed significantly since the 
establishment of diplomatic relations in February 1992. 
  As a result of the trade agreement signed in October that 
year, he noted, the bilateral trade in 1992 totaled more than 54 
million U.S. dollars, representing a 137 percent increase 
compared with the previous year. 
  He revealed that "in the first nine months of 1993 China's 
exports to Israel grew more than 750 percent." 
  He said the aim of his forthcoming visit to China is to 
identify areas of cooperation" in the framework of the 1992 
trade agreement. 
  "We are doing two things now. One is at the official level 
and the other involves business people and companies," he said. 
  Since the visit of Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to China in 
October, who was also accompanied by lots of business people, 
many Israeli companies have approached the Chinese side in 
various aspects of cooperation such as joint ventures and 
import-export projects. 
  He said Israel maintains three free trade agreements with 
the 
United States, the European Community (EC) and the EFTA 
countries (Sweden, Norway, Austria, Iceland, Finland, 
Liechtenstein and Switzerland). These free trade agreements 
give Israel a unique position in international trade, of which 
Chinese businessmen can take advantage. 
  He said Chinese manufacturers can export semi-processed 
goods 
to Israel, finalize their manufacturing process there according 
to established "rules of origin" and then export them to the 
U.S., EC and EFTA countries with no tariff at all. Thus, 
businesses in China can use Israel as a bridge to western 
markets. 
  He said his government is seeking a trade strategy of 
diversification and China, Japan and India will be its best 
partners in Asia and Pacific region.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 11 (AFP) -- A French government 
emissary secretly traveled to Beijing in late December to 
discuss the possibility of a visit by Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur on the 30th anniversary of the establishment of 
Franco-Chinese diplomatic ties, a reliable sources said here 
Tuesday. 
  Jacques Friedmann, a close associate of Balladur, reportedly 
discussed the plan with representatives of the Chinese 
government. France recognized China in January 27, 1964. 
According to well- informed sources in Beijing, the head of the 
French government would visit China with Foreign Affairs 
Minister Alain Juppe and Industry Minister Gerard Longuet from 
January 27 to 30. 
  Friedmann initially visited Beijing in July to revive the 
dialogue between the two countries, which had halted with the 
sale one year ago of French Mirage 2000-5 aircraft to Taiwan, 
the Nationalist island claimed by China. 
  The high-level visit would open a new chapter in Sino-French 
relations. The sale of warplanes to Taiwan had led to the 
closure of the French consulate in the southern Chinese city of 
Guangzhou and the exclusion of French companies from major 
economic projects.

  [Text] Lisbon, 4 Jan (XINHUA) -- Portuguese Foreign 
Minister Durao Barroso said today that "quite satisfactory 
progress" was made in the development of relations between 
Portugal and China in 1993. 
  He made this remark while speaking about China at a forum on 
Portugal's foreign policy at the Foreign Ministry. He 
emphasized: The greatest progress Portugal has achieved in 
developing bilateral relations is with China. Last year, 
Portugal welcomed the visits of PRC President Jiang Zemin and 
Vice President Rong Yiren. There were also frequent exchanges 
of visits by high-ranking officials of the two countries. 
  Barroso also pointed out: On the question of Macao, the 
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group has carried out its work in 
a way both sides consider very positive. 
  He said that his visit to China last year enabled him to 
develop closer contacts with Chinese leaders and enhanced his 
understanding of the current extremely dynamic period in China's 
development.

New Ideas on Economic Work for 1994"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 29 Dec (RENMIN RIBAO)--Guangdong has 
registered a sustained, high-speed, and healthy [chi xu kuai su 
jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] economic growth this 
year as a whole. Summing up the work in the past year, the 
provincial economic work conference, which was held a few days 
ago, also made arrangements for economic work next year and put 
new ideas forward. 
  It has been laid down that, in its economic work for next 
year, Guangdong will make strenuous efforts in three main 
fields, i.e. deepening reform, laying a good foundation, and 
raising efficiency. 
  Governor Zhu Senlin stressed: Next year we should emphasize 
breaking new ground in reform of the enterprise system and 
breakthroughs on important points to boost the overall 
situation. We should select five large and medium-sized state 
enterprises for experiments in establishing a modern enterprise 
system and coordinate state experiments in 100 enterprises. In 
terms of reform measures, we must, first, carry out the 
"Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations" and seriously make good 
the various powers and benefits of enterprises; second, reform 
the property rights system and accelerate establishment and 
amplification of the state assets management structure; and 
third, continuously expand the scope of experiments in a 
standardized enterprise joint-stock system and practice in a 
planned way a corporate system in state-owned enterprises.

  [Text] Guangzhou, January 8 (XINHUA) -- An unprecedented 
organized migration is going on in northern Guangdong Province 
as part of efforts to help the poor. 
  Organized by local governments, many farmers living in the 
impoverished mountainous areas have left their homes and settled 
down in some fertile areas. 
  Northern Guangdong is the poorest area in the province since 
it lies in karst areas where most land is dry and not arable. 
  In sharp contrast with the province's coastal area, which is 
seeing brisk economic progress, about 200,000 people living in 
the north still did not have enough food and clothing in 1993. 
  Since the beginning of 1993, the provincial government has 
started a large-scale migration in many villages and towns in 
the north, where the natural conditions are bad. 
  "I'm glad to move," said Ye Shuisheng, a migrant farmer from 
a village in the north. 
  "My home was two or three hours' walk from highways. It is 
even hard for bicycles to reach," Ye said. 
  He said his village had no electricity and little arable 
land. His family had only 0.15 ha of dry land, which at most 
produced some 500 kg of sweet potatoes and 400 kg of grain a 
year. 
  "We had no money to send our children to school," he said. 
  Ye has moved to another town with over 60 other households 
from his village. 
  The provincial government estimates that, by 1995, a total 
of 
100,000 people in 45 towns in karst areas will voluntarily 
migrate to other, more fertile land. 
  Local governments will provide migrant farmers with 
subsidies 
and arrange for residences and farmland for them. 
  Up to now, the well-organized migration has achieved marked 
results. 
  Half a year ago, 131 households moved into migration zones 
in 
Shantang town, Qingxin County. With 600 yuan (70 U.S. dollars) 
per capita in subsidy, they built houses and planted 50 ha of 
land. 
  By the end of last year, they had reaped 250,000 kg of 
paddy, 
which equalled three years' harvest in their previous home 
places. Many farmers secured enough food within half a year. 
  Now, several migration zones are being built in Qingxin 
County. 
  Another successful example is Qingyuan city, which has built 
up 56 resident zones and will accommodate 90,000 migrant farmers 
by 1995. 
  Besides settling farmers in towns around the city, the city 
government also encourages farmers to work in the urban area. 
Now, many farmers are engaging in manufacturing and service 
trades, not only improving their own living standards, but also 
promoting the local economy. 
  Due to considerate arrangement by the local government, the 
migration is going smoothly. 
  Some 35,000 people have moved out of the karst areas in the 
north of the province, among whom are more than 4,000 people of 
Yao nationality. 
  Urban residents have given full support to the migration. In 
Qingyuan city, people have donated 2.6 million yuan (300,000 
U.S. dollars) and 20,000 clothes items. 
  In addition, many overseas Chinese are also offering aid to 
this project, among whom is Tsang Hin Chi, chairman of Goldlion 
Holdings Limited, who has donated three million yuan (350,000 
U.S. dollars).

  [Text] In the six months ending on 24 December, more than 
26,000 Guangxi frontier troops had taken part in mine clearing 
missions covering a total area of 3.1427 million square meters, 
exceeding the target by 208 percent and providing a fine 
environment for trade exchanges and border people. 
  Since the beginning of the mine clearing mission, frontier 
troops from the Guangxi Military District have fulfilled in a 
timely manner mine clearing tasks in 12 trade ports, including 
Dongxing, Dongzhong, Aidian, and Youyiguan; 17 border trade 
sites, including Zhushan, Canzhan, Lihuo, Banlang, Beishanyouan, 
and Longyao; as well as along main routes. They have cleared 
mines from 118 sites and have marked those sites.

  [Excerpts] As the new year was arriving, the provincial 
governor and vice governors were keeping an eye all the time on 
progress made in an effort to ensure the supply of subsistence 
to enterprise staff and workers and retired personnel. Having 
heard a briefing by departments concerned on the afternoon of 31 
December 1993, Governor Jia Zhijie and Vice Governor Meng 
Qingping gave instructions in this regard and assigned tasks to 
be done before the Spring Festival. 
  After the provincial government issued an urgent circular on 
ensuring the supply of subsistence to enterprise staff and 
workers and retired personnel, all the local authorities 
throughout the province and all the relevant organs directly 
under the provincial authorities have gone into action, made 
every effort, and adopted every suitable measure to ensure the 
supply of subsistence to the staff and workers of enterprises 
that have already suspended operation or are operating at half 
capacity and to retired personnel. [passage omitted] 
  To review the progress made by local authorities and 
departments concerned in implementing the circulars concerned of 
the State Council and the provincial government and to study the 
work plan for the next stage, the provincial government's 
general office called a meeting on 3 January, present at which 
were comrades in charge of the provincial economic commission, 
financial affairs office, federation of trade unions, financial 
department, labor department, branch of the People's Bank, coal 
industry department, textile corporation, and insurance company. 
As an outcome of the meeting, eight inspection groups headed by 
comrades in charge of departments concerned were set up and sent 
to major prefectures and cities on 4 January to monitor and 
oversee implementation of the work and to solve related problems.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday [5 January] Gansu Radio held a 
meeting in Lanzhou on 1994 press and propaganda work. 
Provincial party Secretary Yan Haiwang, Acting Governor Zhang 
Wule, provincial party Deputy Secretary Sun Ying, and Shi 
Zhongyuan, chief of the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda 
Department, attended the meeting. [passage omitted] 
  Secretary Yan Haiwang pointed out: In press and propaganda 
work, prominence should be given to the main theme of 
patriotism, collectivism, and socialism. 
  [Begin Yan recording] Broadcasting and television constitute 
an important front in our ideology and propaganda and are an 
important component of our party's ideological and political 
work. The task for the next step is becoming heavier, like those 
on other fronts. This is because since the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics should 
be implemented with great strides. In particular, next year 
will see the biggest step in reform measures over the the last 
15 years concerning the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure. We can also forecast that next year's 
economic development rate will be the fastest. 
  But we are facing complex problems and there are many new 
situations, maybe we will encounter many new problems. The 
deeper the reform, the more serious the frictions between new 
and old structures and between long-term and immediate or local 
interests. Our broadcasting and television, the entire media, as 
well as the ideological and propaganda front, are facing the 
heavy task of how to comply with central requirements in 
controlling the orientation of the media and giving prominence 
to the main themes. It is also an arduous task to propagate the 
party's policies and principles more extensively and more 
correctly, and to use new, inspiring things emerging in reform 
and economic construction to educate the masses and boost mass 
and cadre confidence and enthusiasm. Apart from party 
committees, which should guide, protect, and bring into play 
cadre and mass initiative in reform and economic construction, 
all entire ideological work should also engage in this, and it 
should be regarded as the most important task in ideological 
work. Everyone should further emancipate their minds and 
continue to display the fine tradition of hard struggle. I 
believe we will fulfill our work better and make greater 
contributions to the development of Gansu's trades and 
undertakings. [end Yan recording]

  [Text] The provincial government issued an urgent circular 
on the control of grain and oil prices and stabilizing markets. 
  The circular requests: All relevant departments throughout 
the province should correctly analyze the situation in grain and 
oil markets, unify their understanding on controlling grain and 
oil prices, and unify their actions in lowering grain and oil 
prices. Effective 31 December, state-owned grain and oil shops 
should attach price tags to the grain and oil they sell. Grain 
and oil prices in all localities should be based on Xining grain 
and oil prices. These prices should be reported to the 
provincial price bureau for registration. 
  The circular stresses: Grain departments should play the 
role of the main channel and ensure market supplies. Grain 
departments in all localities should take the lead in 
controlling grain and oil prices and should not refuse to sell. 
They should take the overall situation into account, do a good 
job in processing and transporting grain and oil, and organize 
grain and oil resources well, so that grain and oil can be sold 
at any time. In particular, oil-bearing crops should be 
procured as much as possible, but rush procurements should be 
prevented. Grain and oil storage should be rationally arranged. 
In the meantime, grain departments in all localities should 
improve their service attitude and quality. Grain and oil 
should be supplied to universities and colleges at wholesale 
prices, and this supply should be ensured. 
  The circular also demands stricter management over grain and 
oil markets. Price as well as industrial and commercial 
departments at all levels should ensure that grain and oil are 
sold with price tags. Price, industrial, commercial, financial, 
and public security departments at all levels should provide 
all-out support for grain departments in ensuring market supply, 
in stabilizing grain and oil prices, and in stabilizing the 
market order. Railway and highway departments should give 
priority to grain and oil transportation arrangements. No units 
are allowed to adjust grain or oil prices without approval. 
  In conclusion, the circular stresses: A general check should 
be conducted over market prices. To stabilize markets and 
protect the market order, price departments should supervise and 
conduct inspection over grain and oil prices during the New Year 
and Spring Festivals, with the participation of industrial, 
commercial, financial, and economic commissions. Units or 
traders who do not implement state regulations will be dealt 
with seriously; those who deal in grain and oil without licenses 
will be banned resolutely. Grain and oil sold in markets must 
have clear price tags. Units or traders who are not equipped 
with the necessary wholesale conditions will have their business 
licenses revoked.

  [Excerpts] On New Year's eve, Zhang Boxing, secretary of 
the provincial party committee and chairman of the provincial 
People's Congress Standing Committee, and Vice Govenor Liu 
Chunmao went to the Weihe chemical fertilizer factory and the 
Weinan economic development zone for investigation. Zhang 
Boxing expressed important views on speeding up the construction 
of the chemical fertilizer factory and the economic development 
zone. 
  Zhang Boxing said: The Weihe chemical fertilizer factory is 
a big project with the most of foreign investment and foreign 
capital and the highest degree of modernization since the 
founding of the PRC. The central authorities, leading comrades, 
and working personnel have all devoted their efforts to this 
project. The Weihe chemical fertilizer factory is one of the 
province's strategic projects. After it goes into production, 
its annual output of 520,000 metric tons of urea will help raise 
the province's per unit grain output by a wide margin. [passage 
omitted] 
  Zhang Boxing pointed out: First, funding should be treated 
as the most important matter. If funding is not ensured, this 
could cause a serious loss and affect the province's reputation 
and image in opening up to the world. Second, construction 
should be organized and coordinated properly, with attention 
paid to safety. Third, good preparations should be made before 
production starts, training should be provided to staff members 
and workers, rules and regulations should be formulated which 
conform with modern enterprise management. Fourth, production 
costs should be reduced by means of meticulous calculations. 
Fifth, all departments should provide all-out support, should 
give the green light, and should not engage in disputes over 
trifles, still less should they create difficulties. 
  On economic development zones, Zhang Boxing said: The 
practice of the Xian and Weinan economic development zones has 
proved that hinterland areas also have the ability to build 
economic development zones well. The most important point is to 
emancipate the mind. [passage omitted]

  [Text] When conducting investigation and study activities 
in Hunjiang and Tonghua, Comrade He Zhukang urged cadres at all 
levels to change ideas, solve problems, accelerate reform, and 
promote development. 
  He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
conducted investigations and study in the two cities of Hunjiang 
and Tonghua from 3 to 8 January. He pointed out: The tasks for 
1994 are very heavy, and how we carry out our work is a very 
important matter. We must thoroughly implement the guidelines 
of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central 
Committee, arm our minds with the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, emancipate our minds, and seek 
truth from facts. We should not only change ideas, but we 
should also solve problems, explore new ideas, and carry forward 
the spirit of creation to implement to the letter the various 
tasks defined at the second plenary session of the sixth 
provincial party committee and to win greater success. 
  In the six-day period, Comrade He Zhukang inspected the 
Hunjiang city cement plant, Hunjiang city aluminum corporation, 
Hunjiang city no. 1 plastics plant, Hunjiang city (Hualian) 
commercial building, Hunjiang city sugar and wine corporation, 
Hunjiang city (Dongyuan) agriculture-industry-commerce group 
company, Hunjiang city's (Sanchazi) District coal transport and 
market corporation, Tonghua Iron and Steel Company, Tonghua city 
textile mill, Tonghua city artificial leather and fur product 
plant, Tonghua city radio plant, Tonghua city pharmaceutical 
plant, Tonghua county (Baiyunshan) pharmaceutical plant, Tonghua 
county leather product plant, Tonghua county paper board mill, 
and Tonghua city plastics plant. Some of them are state-owned 
large- and medium-sized enterprises, and others are shareholding 
enterprises, joint ventures, or private enterprises. He visited 
the production workshops of these enterprises, inspected their 
products, and heard briefings by their responsible persons on 
their production and business. He held several discussions with 
city, county, and district leading cadres and enterprise 
managerial personnel and heard work reports by the party 
committees and governments of Hunjiang and Tonghua cities and by 
the Tonghua county party committee. 
  During the past few years, especially in 1993, Hunjiang and 
Tonghua cities conscientiously paid attention to their work and 
showed much creativity in some aspects. They achieved fairly 
great steps, rapid development, and notable results in reform, 
opening up, economic construction, and other undertakings. A 
number of very convincing examples have emerged. Comrade He 
Zhukang fully affirmed this. He said: I am very much inspired 
by your achievements, which prove that we have great potential 
for economic development. As long as we adhere to the party's 
basic line, emancipate our minds, and seize the opportunity to 
work in a down-to-earth manner, accelerate reform and 
development, and pool the efforts of all fields to work in 
unison, the province will successfully attain the goal of 
promoting its economy to a new height. 
  Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: The third plenary session of 
the 14th party Central Committee made a decision of the CPC 
Central Committee on the several issues concerning the 
establishment of the socialist market economy system. The 
second plenary session of the sixth provincial party committee 
put forward clear arrangements and specific requirements for 
implementing the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 
14th party Central Committee, promoting Jilin's reform focusing 
on establishing the socialist market economy system, and 
accelerating the development of its economic construction and 
other undertakings. Our current basic task is to implement the 
arrangements with great efforts. By doing work in a creative 
manner, we mean chiefly implementation in a creative manner. We 
should give full play to our subjective initiative, carry out 
all work in a down-to-earth manner, and fulfill our tasks at 
high standards. We are currently in an important period for 
great development and great change. Faced with the new 
situation in which opportunities and difficulties exist 
simultaneously and changes are rapid, leading cadres at all 
levels should diligently use their minds to analyze the 
situation, study new conditions and new problems, understand in 
a timely manner people's state of mind, be clearheaded to 
estimate favorable and unfavorable factors, and distinguish the 
essentials from the nonessentials. In the condition of the 
market economy, sources and geographical position are not 
absolute conditions, and they all depend on human effort. 
Regarding the endeavors we think are worthwhile, we should 
develop bravely as long as we have the basic conditions for them 
and never lose the opportunity. Those who understand this early 
and take action early will gain the initiative. Reform will be 
carried out across the board this year in a range and quality 
unprecedented in history. If we can correctly estimate the 
situation, think over some issues in advance, and accurately 
seize the opportunity, we will acquire more foresight in doing 
work, adopt realistic measures, and make correct policy 
decisions. It is totally possible for us, the latecomers, to 
attain our goals and surpass the old-timers. 
  Our general demand is emancipating the mind, seizing the 
opportunity to accelerate reform and development, promoting 
development with reform, and continuing reform in the process of 
development. Faced with the new situation and tasks, leading 
cadres should further emancipate their minds, embrace new 
concepts, form new ideas, and have more spirit of exploration 
and creation. Work compatible with the three advantages should 
be bravely experimented and explored so that reform, opening up, 
and economic construction can be facilitated continuously. 
  Comrade He Zhukang said: Favorable conditions are numerous 
for this year's work. When making work arrangements, we should 
adopt a higher starting point, higher goals, and quicker steps. 
We should tap potential, fully develop our advantages, boost 
the enthusiasm of all fields, and pool the efforts of all people 
to achieve great development bravely. On the premise of this, 
we should carry out meticulous work and adopt different measures 
to resolve different difficulties, contradictions, and problems. 
  Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: We should further change 
leadership methods. When carrying out economic and other work, 
we should focus on priorities, achieve breakthroughs in 
resolving difficulties, and avoid vague generalization. We 
should coordinate the effort to change concepts with that to 
solve specific problems, both noting that new conditions are 
unavoidable in the process of reform and resolving new 
contradictions and new problems in a timely manner. In line 
with market demand and the principle of improving efficiency, we 
should adjust the ownership structure, the industrial 
composition, and product mix. We should strengthen 
macroeconomic regulation and control as well as enterprise 
management, step up efforts in scientific and technological 
advance, bring in advanced technology through the market to 
carry out technical transformation, and establish our superior 
industries and highly competitive products amid competition. We 
should strengthen marketing and actively open up the market. We 
should appoint able and virtuous people, improve leading bodies, 
and do a good job in training workers to improve their overall 
quality. 
  Comrade He Zhukang said: In developing the socialist market 
economy, we should also rely on the masses. The more arduous 
and heavier our tasks are, the more we should boost the 
enthusiasm of workers. We should intensify the ideological and 
political education of enterprises to enhance workers' sense of 
masters. We should firmly rely on the vast number of workers 
and pool their wisdom and efforts to operate enterprises 
successfully. We should encourage them to participate in 
management in a democratic manner to suggest ways and means, 
rely on the collective wisdom to surmount difficulties, and 
create a new situation. 
  Comrade He Zhukang urged: Cadres at all levels should remain 
clearheaded in the excellent situation and properly handle the 
relationship between reform and development on the one hand and 
stability on the other. They should have a full understanding 
of the uneven development, show concern for the people's life, 
give heed to their opinions and voice, succeed in 
comprehensively improving public security, and safeguard social 
stability. In rural areas, we should greatly develop the 
collective economy. There should be collectively operated 
projects at the village level in order to reduce the burdens on 
peasants. To resolve the difficulties in the life of the 
workers of the enterprises whose production is suspended totally 
or partly, we should have a long-term viewpoint and establish a 
social security system. Governments and enterprises may further 
relax policies and systems to encourage the masses to open up 
broad avenues for employment. Meanwhile, we should adopt 
effective measures to ensure the basic life of the workers of 
suspended enterprises. Leading cadres at all levels should make 
it a system to make contacts frequently with the workers and 
peasant households who have temporary difficulties in their 
life. We should fully develop our political advantages, the 
role of party organizations as fighting bastions, the role of 
party members as vanguards and models, and the role of trade 
unions, Communist Youth League, and women's federations as 
bridges and channels. 
  Also participating in the investigation and study activities 
were responsible comrades of the general office of the 
provincial party committee, the provincial trade union council, 
and the provincial commission for restructuring of the economy.

  [Text] China has quietly stepped up preparations for the 
1994-95 elections which will feature the most-ever pro-Beijing 
candidates despite the Sino-British standoff, according to 
sources. 
  A senior local Xinhua (New China News Agency) official has 
been given the responsibility of coordinating the fielding of 
candidates to the three sets of polls. 
  The main job of Huang Zhizhao, a deputy secretary-general, 
is 
to liaise with the three district offices of the de facto 
embassy which handle district-level matters in Hong Kong Island, 
Kowloon and the New Territories. 
  A more senior-level working group to be headed by Zheng 
Guoxiong, a Xinhua vice-director, will be formed to map out the 
overall strategy for pro-China forces in the elections for the 
district boards, the two municipal councils and the Legislative 
Council. 
  Mr Zheng is in charge of organisational matters within 
Xinhua-- the most politically sensitive and secretive work of 
Beijing's establishment in Hong Kong. 
  A source said yesterday that Mr Huang had been working 
behind 
the scenes for months to strengthen coordination among the three 
district offices. 
  One of the major tasks of the district offices was to 
identify pro-China supporters to stand for district and 
municipal-level polls, he said. 
  Community staff from the offices will liaise with different 
candidates to avoid direct conflict within the pro-China circle, 
the source said. 
  "Staff of the district offices have often raised the 
question 
of whether there are good candidates for the forthcoming 
elections... Such activities have not come to a halt because of 
the political row," the source said. 
  Contrary to previous speculation, the pro-China camp would 
not boycott the elections, he said. 
  Although Chinese officials have yet to spell out whether 
pro- 
China figures should take part in the polls, political groups 
considered sympathetic to Beijing, such as the Democratic 
Aliiance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), have said they 
will join the fray. 
  A DAB core leader said the party would field about 50 to 100 
candidates to contest the 300-plus seats in the district polls 
next year. 
  "It's out of the question that we should or would boycott 
the 
elections. No one has disputed that. We ought to seize the 
opportunity to strengthen our links at district levels," said 
Cheng Kai-nam. 
  In addition to the DAB, leaders of traditional pro-China 
associations as well as kaifong groups will form the major 
component of the left-wing forces. 
  Some pro-China figures said the scale of participation of 
pro- China candidates in the next three-tier polls would be the 
largest ever. 
  One veteran left-wing leader said he expected pro-China 
candidates to contest more than half the district seats next 
year. 
  Although some candidates might prefer standing in the polls 
as independents especially in district board elections, he said 
many are set to seek backing from the pro-China camp.

  [Text] Governor Chris Patten yesterday said there was 
confusion over China's stance on how Hong Kong residents with 
foreign passports could obtain the right of abode after 1997. 
  "I think that many people in Hong Kong will be a little 
puzzled by the various messages which have been coming out of 
Beijing. 
  "There were, I think, two rather different impressions given 
yesterday about future Chinese intention on right of abode," Mr 
Patten said. 
  The Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, Lu Ping, reportedly said on Thursday morning 
that Hong Kong residents with foreign passports would not need 
to go through another application process to acquire the right 
of abode after 1997. 
  But he said later in the day that people with foreign 
passports would lose their Chinese nationality, and a clear set 
of criteria would be worked out to allow the recovery of 
permanent resident status. 
  Mr Lu added China would adopt a more lenient policy towards 
these people. 
  It is estimated there are 300,000 to 400,000 people whose 
right of abode in Hong Kong will be in doubt after 1997 because 
they own foreign passports. 
  Mr Patten said he was confused about China's stance, and the 
Government was anxious to reach an agreement on the issue to put 
to rest the anxiety of the people involved.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Says Sino-British Cooperation on </F>
Hong Kong Issue Has Been Ruined by Chris Patten"] 
  [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA News 
Agency Hong Kong Branch, has said the Chinese side hopes that 
China and Britain can maintain a good cooperative relationship 
between them as Hong Kong is now in the late transitional 
period. However, he added, it is a pity that this cooperative 
relationship has been ruined by Chris Patten. 
  Zhang Junsheng made the above statement to reporters 
yesterday evening when attending the founding ceremony of the 
Hong Kong Society of Creative Photographic Art. He was asked by 
reporters to comment on remarks by the British Foreign Office 
minister Alastair Goodlad that Sino-British relations at present 
are not too bad. 
  Zhang Junsheng said: "I wish it were true. However, now the 
problem is that the very important part of Sino-British 
relations, that is, the cooperative relationship between China 
and Britain on the Hong Kong issue, has been ruined by the 
British side, and by Chris Patten in particular. The Chinese 
side, of course, hopes China and Britain can maintain a good 
cooperative relationship between them, but for the moment 
Sino-British relations have actually been greatly impaired." 
  Zhang Junsheng said: China and Britain should cooperate more 
closely in this late transitional period to ensure prosperity, 
stability, and a steady transition, which is the goal clearly 
laid down in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Now, the 
problem is that the British side has ruined cooperation despite 
the Chinese side's wish for cooperation. In this case, what can 
we do on our part? Now that the British side refuses to 
cooperate, the Chinese side cannot stand by idly doing nothing 
but waiting for the British side to return to cooperation. 
  A reporter mentioned that a couple of days ago Chris Patten 
had accused the economic subgroup of the Preliminary Work 
Committee [PWC] of nursing ulterior motives in inviting Hong 
Kong Government officials to visit Beijing to explain a bill on 
the Airport Corporation's articles of association. Zhang 
Junsheng asked: Then what is the motive? Chris Patten did not 
specify it at all. A few days ago, Chris Patten said he would 
not restrain British Hong Kong Government officials from 
contacting members of the PWC. But now he has categorically 
rejected an official invitation from the PWC. In fact, the PWC 
economic subgroup's letter of invitation very expressly states 
that the PWC needed to study the issue, and its purpose in 
studying this is to give advice to the Chinese representatives 
on the Airport Committee before further negotiations with their 
British counterparts. What is wrong with doing this? 
  Zhang Junsheng said: Some members of the PWC, when studying 
the case, have found that they do not understand or are not 
quite clear about some articles in the bill; therefore, they 
have asked Hong Kong Government officials to explain the bill to 
them. The purpose is very clear, and it has been stated very 
clearly in the invitation letter. Should there be any doubts 
about this? 
  A reporter said to Zhang Junsheng: Referring to the 
reorganization of the three-tier assemblies in 1997, some PWC 
members have suggested that the nonpolitical assemblies be 
allowed to switch over by means of endorsement and reappointment 
rather than reelection. The reporter asked Zhang whether he 
agreed with this idea. Zhang Junsheng said: In principle, all 
assemblies should be dismissed and reestablished. However, 
before a final decision is made, everybody is welcome to air his 
views on the reorganization of these assemblies. Now that PWC 
members are voicing their opinions on this issue and are 
discussing it, this shows that they are very seriously and 
responsibly considering the case of Hong Kong's transition. 
With a smile he said to the reporters: "You may express your 
opinions as well!"

  [Text] China's Preparatory Committee for the post-1997 
government could take on the role of a temporary Legislative 
Council, following fears that Hong Kong will be hit by a 
six-month legal vacuum after the transfer of sovereignty. 
China's advisory body on transitional matters--the Preliminary 
Working Committee (PWC)--put forward the radical proposal 
yesterday, to counter a potential legal vacuum which members say 
could cripple Hong Kong for between three to six months. 
  The proposal resolved to ask the National People's Congress 
to authorise the Preparatory Committee to make laws until a 
permanent legislature is established. China has said it will 
dissolve the Legislative Council in 1997, leaving the territory 
without a law- making body. 
  It is believed it will take China between three to six 
months 
to set up a new government after 30 June 1997. But a 
legislative vacuum will only exist if China decides to change or 
abolish existing Hong Kong laws. If no changes are made there 
will be a parliamentary recess until the new Legislative Council 
is formed. The PWC's legal group will conduct a review of Hong 
Kong laws and recommend if any need to be changed under Chinese 
rule. 
  In a heated debate during the PWC's meeting yesterday 
members 
also planned to grant the chief executive power to proclaim 
interim legislation. Some members argued that under the Basic 
Law the Preparatory Committee did not have the power to take on 
the role of the legislature. But others said the committee's 
task was to deal with issues concerning the formation of the 
first government. 
  China threatened to abolish the through train principle and 
dissolve the Legislative Council following the breakdown of 
Sino- British talks on Hong Kong's political future.

  [Text] China's advisory body on transitional matters--the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC)--has given the strongest 
indication yet that district board and municipal council members 
may be able to retain their posts after 1997. 
  The PWC's government and administration sub-group, which 
will 
determine the function and the formation of Hong Kong's post- 
handover government, resolved yesterday to allow members of 
local government bodies to ride the through train beyond 1997. 
  Sources said there was growing opposition within PWC ranks 
to 
China's threat to dissolve membership of municipal councils and 
district boards established under Governor Chris Patten's 
electoral reforms. 
  But the chances of legislators hanging on to their seats 
after the transfer of sovereignty remained slim. 
  Group leader Xiao Weiyun said a more flexible approach was 
possible to district board and municipal councils which were not 
considered to embrace political power. 
  Group member and professor at the Chinese University Lau 
Siu-kai said: "Although the three tiers of government should 
end with the end of the British administration, the two-tier 
bodies should survive... given that they have no political power 
and their job mainly concerns people's livelihood." 
  He added the move would benefit a smooth transition and 
boost 
public confidence. It would also encourage existing members to 
continue to run for elections. 
  The group also issued a statement yesterday setting out the 
legal principles behind China's decision to disband Hong Kong's 
three tiers of government. 
  The statement said that under the principle of the Joint 
Declaration, government bodies formed under British rule would 
end on 30 June 1997. 
  "Obviously, the existing laws which set four years as the 
term of office for the three-tier bodies will therefore be 
invalid," it says. 
  It goes on to say that the status, function and formation of 
the three-tier bodies under the Special Administrative Region 
(SAR) would be entirely different from those under British rule.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "PWC's Pressure Point"] </F>
  [Text] China's Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the 
post-1997 administration has put the Hong Kong Government in a 
very difficult spot. It has asked to consult civil servants as 
it develops plans and policies for the future. It is a clever 
request which squeezes a tender pressure point. What, after 
all, could better help a smooth transition than advice from 
those who know the workings of government? The Government 
yesterday responded to the PWC's initial specific request by 
warning that the Secretary for Economic Services, Gordon Siu 
Kwing-chue, would not be allowed to appear before the committee 
in Beijing. It further made it clear it had no plans to relax 
its wider ban on official civil service contacts with the PWC. 
But how that edict holds up as time passes may become a test of 
the Government's self-confidence in the final years of British 
rule. 
  By inviting civil servants to appear before it, the PWC has 
challenged Chris Patten's authority over his staff and presented 
him with a profound dilemma. 
  Mr Patten has strong arguments for refusing to let his 
officials talk to the PWC. Nothing would give more credibility 
and legitimacy to what is, to all intents and purposes, the Hong 
Kong takeover committee. The PWC has no official status in 
Sino-British relations and cannot take the decisions for which 
the Joint Liaison Group (JLG) was set up. But treating it as 
though it were a legitimate body would tend to sideline the JLG 
and turn it into a rubber stamp. The influence of Britain and 
its governor would wane as his civil service switched its 
attentions, information, and advice to China. The Legislative 
Council would become an increasingly irrelevant talking shop. 
And the loyalty of civil servants would be divided: which 
government would be their real master? 
  But if Mr Patten maintained his ban, he would be accused of 
a 
lack of cooperation and of undermining the smooth transfer of 
sovereignty. That in itself would not worry him. What would be 
harder to ignore is that as China develops the authority of the 
PWC, it will gain importance in the lives of Hong Kong people. 
If China continued to block progress in the JLG, the PWC might 
usurp some of its functions. Starving it of the information it 
needs to make the best decisions might be damaging to the 
territory in the long run. Further, as 1997 draws nearer, 
advising the PWC might be the best way for the Hong Kong 
Government to influence its thinking and, therefore, the 
policies to be pursued over the longer term. 
  Here is the core of Mr Patten's dilemma. If he allows 
cooperation now, he might be forced into the role of 
co-conspirator in China's plans to reduce his influence. But if 
he rejects cooperation outright, over time he risks reducing his 
chance to influence developments. 
  Mr Patten's own strategy centres on building up Legco's 
authority. But this task has been made harder by China's threat 
to disband the territory's parliament after 1997. So the PWC's 
request for contact with civil servants is not one that can be 
easily met with automatic and total rejection. It is an issue 
to which Mr Patten must give further deep and serious thought.

  [Text] The public has a low opinion of the Preliminary 
Working Committee (PWC) which contradicts China's claim the 
consultative body represents the view of the people of Hong Kong. 
  In a survey conducted by the pressure group, Hong Kong 
Policy 
Viewers, only 26 per cent of 660 respondents said the PWC 
represented Hong Kong people. 
  Forty per cent said the group did not represent them while 
the remaining respondents, or 32 per cent, said they doubted 
whether the PWC would represent their views. 
  The people who were questioned also said they were 
dissatisfied with the present representation and appointment 
system of the PWC. 
  PWC members are appointed by the Chinese government on the 
recommendations of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and 
the Xinhua News Agency, China's de facto embassy in the 
territory. 
  The poll found that 63 per cent of the respondents were 
dissatisfied with the choice and the manner in which the PWC 
members were appointed, while only 15 per cent said they were 
satisfied. 
  Spokesman for Hong Kong Policy Viewers, Simon Chiu, said 
these figures showed the PWC did not have much credibility in 
the eyes of Hong Kong people. 
  During the recent political row between Britain and China, 
Governor Chris Patten said the PWC did not represent the view of 
Hong Kong people. 
  But Chinese officials have maintained the PWC spoke for the 
people of Hong Kong. 
  Chiu called on the Chinese government to appoint people from 
different political camps to make it more accountable to the 
people of Hong Kong so that it will have the trust of the people 
of Hong Kong. 
  He said some of the PWC's meetings should be opened to the 
public and the press. 
  "By opening some parts of their meetings to the press, 
people 
in Hong Kong can find out what the PWC is doing and have a 
better understanding of its function," Chiu said. 
  He also called on the Chinese government to set up a better 
channel through which the public can to express its views to the 
PWC. [sentence as published] 
  The survey found that 48 per cent of respondents did not 
believe the existing channel would allow the PWC to gather their 
views while 31 per cent had reservations. 
  Chiu said the Hong Kong Policy Viewers would ask to meet PWC 
members to voice their concerns. 
  The survey was carried out in the last two weeks of 
December.

  [Text] China has started drawing up nominations for the 
position of Hong Kong's first chief executive under the 
post-1997 Special Administrative Region (SAR) government. 
Sources revealed yesterday the State Council's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office asked China's de facto embassy in Hong 
Kong--the Xinhua News Agency--to start preparing a list of 
possible candidates late last year. 
  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) members have suggested 
the candidate could be a man or woman, should be an experienced 
civil servant, and not have a strong political background. The 
chief executive will be Hong Kong's most powerful person after 
1997, replacing Britain's colonial Governor as the territory's 
top official. 
  It is also believed members of China's advisory body on 
transitional matters, the PWC, proposed to put the issue to its 
government and administration sub-group at a meeting last 
Thursday [6 January]. But members disagreed on the issue and 
postponed discussions until a later date. 
  Sources said nominations for the chief executive would be 
based on three principles; the candidate needed to have the 
approval of the mainland's Central Peoples Government, he or she 
must have high prestige amongst civil servants, and must be 
acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. Nominees will also have 
to satisfy some basic criteria, outlined in the Basic Law. 
  The Basic Law says the chief executive must be a Chinese 
citizen of not less than 40 who is a permanent resident of Hong 
Kong. He or she must have no right of abode in any foreign 
country and have lived in Hong Kong for a continuous period of 
not less than 20 years. The Basic Law says the chief executive 
will be selected by "elections or local consultations". The 
chief executive must serve a five-year term and cannot serve for 
more than two consecutive terms. 
  PWC member and former executive councillor Rita Fan said the 
chief executive must be "someone who is strong, outstanding, 
able and a very good communicator". In a recent interview with 
The Standard, Fan said the first chief executive after the 
transfer of sovereignty would have one of the most difficult 
jobs in Hong Kong's history. Fan, who resigned from the 
Executive Council shortly after Governor Chris Patten arrived in 
the territory, is herself tipped to be one of the candidates. 
But Fan said she would never take on the job. "Personally I am 
not interested and I don't have the ability to do it," she said. 
  PWC member Raymond Wu said the chief executive should be an 
existing civil servant, have a non-political background, and 
have an "unconfrontational" relationship with China. He also 
said the PWC was not the appropriate place to talk about 
candidates for the chief executive, although the PWC would have 
a say in the formation of the selection committee which appoints 
the chief executive. 
  With 1997 still three-and-a-half years away there has been 
little speculation on possible candidates for the top job. A 
number of senior civil servants in the Patten administration 
known to be sympathetic towards China are also likely to be on 
the list of candidates. Names that could be floated from the 
PWC itself include Fan, chairman of the pro-China Democratic 
Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, Tsang Yok-sing, member 
of the PWC's government and administration sub-group, and 
Chinese University professor Lau Siu-kai. Former secretary for 
home affairs Peter Tsao could also be in the running. 
  Chinese officials such as Hong Kong and Macao Office Affairs 
director Lu Ping are out of the race because they do not fit the 
Basic Law criteria of being permanent residents of Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [Report by Michael Smith, Rain Ren in Beijing and M.Y. Sung] </F>
  [Text] A senior government official has denied accusations 
he cancelled a visit to Beijing because of the row over calls 
for civil servants to brief China's Preliminary Working 
Committee (PWC). 
  A senior Chinese official said yesterday the Secretary for 
Economic Services Gordon Siu had called off a scheduled business 
trip to Beijing to avoid further confrontation over his presence 
in the Chinese capital. 
  The incident fuelled Sino-British tensions over this week's 
sensitive invitation for Hong Kong government officials to brief 
the PWC. 
  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office director Lu Ping said Siu 
had cancelled a prearranged visit to sign a civil aviation 
agreement with the mainland. 
  But Siu rejected the claim, saying arrangements had not been 
finalised and he had not decided whether to go or not. 
  "I have not given any indication of when I will visit China, 
and certainly as far as the signing of the agreement is 
concerned it will probably be by the director (of Civil 
Aviation) and his team," Siu said. 
  Lu maintained the visit had been called off and accused 
Governor Chris Patten of confusing politics and the economy, a 
criticism which he has repeatedly directed at China. 
  "He (Patten) has been all along talking about the separation 
of politics and economy. Now he himself is mixing up the two," 
Lu said. 
  But Patten went on the defensive and said there were hidden 
motives behind the invitation. 
  The Hong Kong government rejected an invitation this week 
for 
Siu to brief the PWC on the controversial Airport Corporation 
Bill. 
  It is believed the invite has political motives and signals 
the start of a fight for control of the Hong Kong bureaucracy 
before 1997. 
  A government spokesman also rejected a media report which 
said civil servants who accepted the PWC's invitation would be 
committing an act of treason as "absolute nonsense". 
  He said many officials could retain contacts with the PWC on 
an informal basis. 
  Patten said yesterday there were hidden motives behind the 
invitation, arguing the PWC already had access to government 
officials through their many members involved in the Airport 
Consultative Committee, the Legislative Council and the 
Provisional Airport Authority. 
  "I think one has to take this particular request with a 
pinch 
of salt and ask some questions about the motive, Patten said. 
  Patten reiterated the two sides should use the established 
channels for communication. 
  "I very much hope that we can get through this stage of 
adjectives and words being thrown at us and get on with the 
business of cooperation," he said.

  [Text] The delay in reaching an accord with China on 
airport financing is not only jeopardising possible savings of 
$5.5 billion from lower tender prices on the 10 core projects 
but will prevent them being completed on time. 
  Missing the mid-1997 opening date by a year would wipe out 
the savings and add $8.2 billion to the overall bill. 
  A recently completed internal study by the Finance Branch 
concluded that a one-year delay would cost Hong Kong $3 billion 
in possible benefits, such as revenues from tourism. 
  But a two-year delay would cost the territory $9 billion, 
and 
$18 billion would be lost after three years. 
  Lower prices for civil engineering works worldwide are 
understood to be a key factor in pushing down the cost of the 10 
core projects, especially the seven government-funded schemes, 
which are well under way. 
  It is now certain that the airport railway to be built by 
the 
Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) cannot be completed by 
mid- 1997 as scheduled. 
  There is still a chance, however, that Chek Lap Kok airport 
could open on time. 
  Officials are said to be anxious to reach an agreement with 
China on the airport financing scheme so as to take advantage of 
the lower construction prices. 
  The study found that the costs of building the airport and 
its rail link would rise by $2 billion and $2.1 billion 
respectively if the completion date was deferred by six months, 
and double that if delayed for a year. 
  As funds are running out for the Provisional Airport 
Authority (PAA), Treasury officials will today inform the 
Legislative Council about the Government's updated study of the 
airport core plan and seek their advice on the way forward. 
  Sources said two options would be presented. 
  The "pause option" envisages only enough extra funds to 
cover 
the expenses required by the PAA to finish the works under way 
at present. 
  The other option will be a more forward-looking alternative, 
seeking councillors' approval for awarding enough funds to cover 
not only the PAA's running costs, but also to foot the bill for 
three urgent construction-related contracts. 
  The three contracts include the design contract for the new 
airport's baggage handling and automatic people mover systems, 
which costs $120 million. 
  Tenders for the design contract would have to be awarded by 
the end of this month to keep in line with the original 1997 
opening date. 
  Another urgent contract is the $719 million foundation works 
for the airport passenger terminal, and the third contract, 
costing $455 million, is the construction of support facilities 
at Chek Lap Kok, such as submarine water pipelines, sewage 
plants, a power substation and a temporary ferry pier for 
shipping construction materials and workers. 
  Sources said that to ensure the airport was completed on 
time, the contracts for foundation work and the supporting 
facilities had to be awarded by the end of March. 
  Together with the $400 million running costs for the PAA for 
the 1994-95 financial year and the extension of Bechtel's 
consultancy for one year, the second option envisages the 
Government seeking close to $2 billion from the Legislative 
Council. 
  The amount would still keep the overall capital injection 
into the airport project within the $16.6 billion ceiling set in 
the original financing package presented to the Chinese side two 
years ago. 
  So far, the Government has pumped a total of $14.6 billion 
into the airport body. 
  Of the two options presented to legislators today, the 
Government sees the "pause option" as disruptive and 
undesirable, as it would send the wrong signal to PAA staff that 
the Government was paving the way for the office to close down. 
  Officials are concerned that the "pause option" would lead 
to 
an exodus of staff, making it extremely difficult to 
re-establish the PAA office. 
  The Government would prefer to keep the momentum going, 
especially in view of lower tender prices, down by about 10 
percent to 25 percent, on the civil engineering side. 
  In the Government's updated study on the overall costs of 
the 
10 airport core projects, which still assumes the new airport's 
opening date in 1997, the total bill for constructing the seven 
government- funded projects has gone down by $7.6 billion, from 
the original $60.1 billion, to $52.5 billion. 
  Costs for building the airport are estimated to go up 
slightly by $1.6 billion, from the original $63.6 billion to 
$65.2 billion.

<F P=106> [By Chan Po-chung and Michael Chugani in Washington] </F>
  [Text] Financial Secretary Hamish Macleod says the new 
trade row between the United States and China will hurt Hong 
Kong--but local analysts say the impact will be limited. 
  Macleod was reacting to yesterday's threat by the U.S. to 
slash quotas on imports of Chinese textiles. 
  Meanwhile China yesterday threatened to retaliate against 
the 
"irresponsible" U.S. decision and called for a return to the 
negotiating table. 
  In the U.S., however, the head of the Textile Manufacturers 
Institute called China "an international outlaw" and said 
China's illegal textiles transshipments had cost the U.S. 50,000 
jobs. 
  The U.S. has given China until 17 January before it actually 
imposes the quota cuts, which are expected to be between 25 and 
35 percent of China's total textile quota to the U.S. 
  Macleod said Hong Kong would suffer, but he said the 
territory should keep out of the row. 
  "As a matter of fact, we have our own quota arrangements 
with 
the U.S. government so Hong Kong's direct trade will not be 
affected," he said. 
  However, he admitted that Hong Kong's economy would be 
affected, both directly and indirectly, if the cuts went ahead. 
  "Quite a large number of local textile manufacturers have 
moved their production bases to the mainland, therefore a direct 
impact would be apparent on them. 
  "It would affect Hong Kong entrepreneurs' investments in 
China very directly." 
  Macleod said Hong Kong would also suffer indirectly as a 
result of the drop in textile shipments to the U.S. from China, 
because the re-export trade would be hit. 
  But local analysts said the quota cuts would not have a 
major 
impact on Hong Kong garment makers in the short term despite the 
heavy shift of Hong Kong production facilities into southern 
China. 
  "Hong Kong right now is not using much of China's quotas so 
I 
wouldn't say that in the medium term it would have much impact," 
Barings Securities analyst Chris Li said. 
  Beijing condemned the U.S. for its unilateral move to slash 
China's quotas in a strongly worded protest by a Foreign Trade 
Ministry spokesman carried by the official XINHUA News Agency. 
  "The irresponsible action taken by the U.S. has caused both 
strong reaction in China and extensive dissatisfaction in the 
U.S.," he said. 
  A Hong Kong Trade Department spokesman said yesterday that 
the territory's role as a port for China's world trade would 
suffer if Beijing and Washington failed to settle the dispute 
soon. 
  He said there would be no immediate impact, but added: "If a 
resolution is not reached in due course, re-exports of 
Chinese-made textiles and clothing to the U.S. will be affected." 
  China's textiles re-exports through Hong Kong to the U.S. 
was 
estimated to be about $26 billion in 1993. 
  Raymond Chien, chairman of the board of directors of the 
Hong 
Kong Industrial Technology Centre Corporation, described the 
U.S. move as "shocking". 
  He hit out at Washington for mixing issues and blaming China 
as a whole for the work of a few corrupt traders.

  [Text] Macao, Jan 11 (AFP)--Portuguese Prime Minister 
Anibal Cavaco Silva is to visit China in April, followed by 
President Mario Soares later in the year, Portugal's Lusa news 
agency reported Tuesday. Quoting sources in Beijing, it said 
Cavaco Silva's trip would mark the seventh anniversary on April 
13 of a treaty which he signed to return Macao to Chinese 
administration in December 1999. 
  Macau Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira is expected to be part of 
the prime minister's entourage, the news agency added. In stark 
contrast to Sino-British conflicts over nearby Hong Kong, which 
reverts to China in 1997, Lisbon's relations with Beijing over 
Macao are officially described as "excellent." 
  Portugal has occupied Macau since 1557, but has recognized 
Chinese sovereignty over the enclave on the south China coast 
since 1974. Chinese Premier Li Peng invited Cavaco Silva to 
visit China when he visited Lisbon in February last year, Lusa 
said.

  [Text] Macao, January 8 (XINHUA) -- Bank of China Macao 
branch reported an increase of over 10 percent in terms of its 
realized profits in 1993, as compared with the figure for 1992. 
  Bank savings rose by five percent over that of 1992 which 
was 
23.52 billion Macao patacas (about 3.5 billion U.S. dollars). 
An increase of 30 percent was also reported in terms of bank 
loans in 1993, much higher than the 11.2 billion Macao patacas 
(about 1.4 billion U.S. dollars) in the previous year. 
  According to an official with the bank, last year's bank 
loans were mainly used in industrial production and foreign 
trade, adding that the sharp increase in this regard had 
resulted from the huge demand of capital in Macao in the past 
year. 
  Bank of China Macao branch is one of the leading commercial 
banks in Macao. Currently, it has 20 sub-branches all over 
Macao. 
  In 1992, its realized profit stood at 34.5 billion Macao 
patacas (about 4.5 billion U.S. dollars)

<F P=106> [By commentator Wang Furu (3769 4395 1172): "Reviewing Mao </F>
Zedong's Teachings on Resisting `Sugar-Coated Bullets'"] 
  [Text] The anticorruption drive, which began in the autumn 
of 1993 and has become the focus of attention at home and 
abroad, has already scored certain results of a phased nature, 
and some corrupt elements who failed to sustain the tests from 
government, reform, and opening up, have been uncovered one 
after another, and have been punished according to the country's 
law and the party's discipline. This move wins the hearts of the 
people, and the struggle is develping steadily and in an orderly 
manner. 
  One prominent feature of the corrupt phenomenon at this time 
is that unlawful elements in the society vigorously engage in 
trading money for power with the mutated elements within party 
and government departments, and they vehemently embezzle state 
assets to an alarming extent. The emergence of this feature 
cannot but make us recall Comrade Mao Zedong's warning on 
resisting "sugar-coated bullets," a warning he gave on the eve 
of the nation's founding. Those teachings are still very 
practical and applicable today. At this time when the 100th 
birthday of Mao Zedong is approaching, with this article I want 
to cherish my profound memory of our revered old man. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong spent all his life on the undertakings of 
the party and the people; he hoped our people's government and 
socialist undertaking would not be forfeited because of our own 
corruption. As early as the period of rectification campaign in 
Yenan, Comrade Mao Zedong reminded the whole party not to once 
again make the mistake of being arrogant in time of victory in 
his report entitled "Study and the Times." He praised Comrade 
Guo Moruo's article entitled "Memorial Ceremony for 300 Years of 
Jia Shen," which described the lesson one can learn from Li 
Zicheng who walked from victory to failure; he asked the senior 
cadres in the whole party to learn from the article. At the 
Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee, 
which was convened on the eve of the overall victory across the 
country, Comrade Mao Zedong gave some earnest advice: "The 
might of the enemies cannot conquer us, and this point has 
already been proved. But flattery from the bourgeoisie could 
conquer the weak-minded persons within our contingent. There 
could be some party members who have never been conquered by the 
enemies who held guns, and they lived up to the title of hero in 
front of those enemies, but they cannot sustain the attack by 
the bullets which are coated with sugar, and they will lose the 
battle when such bullets are used. We must take precautionary 
measures against such a situation." Comrade Mao Zedong's 
prophecy unfortunately came true, during the "1951-1952 movement 
against the three evils," the corrupt, degraded, and mutated 
elements such as Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, who were the 
typical examples, were discovered. In order to more effectively 
prevent the cadre contingent from decaying, and to better save 
the majority of the cadres who had made mistakes, the CPC 
Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, after very careful 
consideration, resolutely sentenced these two seriously 
degenerated elements to death. 
  Today, under the conditions of reform, opening up, and 
development of market economy, the situation is very different 
from the one shortly after the nation's founding. But Comrade 
Mao Zedong's teachings on resisting the "sugar-coated bullets" 
still have great practical significance. Because, even under 
the conditions of development of a market economy and the 
practice of separation of the government and enterprises, the 
government still has the duty of exercising macro-regulation, 
control, and management over the economy, and judicial 
departments, administrative and law enforcement organs, and 
economic management departments still have relatively great 
powers. Unlawful elements in society and those who are obsessed 
with the desire for gain, will use various means to shoot 
sugar-coated bullets, leap over and erode the supervisory powers 
of party and government officials and even senior cadres, and 
pull the weak-minded into the water, to serve as the protective 
umbrellas from unlawful and criminal elements. Compared with 
the period shortly after the nation's founding, the main body 
shooting sugar-coated bullets is different now; at that time 
they were the old bourgeois elements, and now they are probably 
new figures who hold various titles such as "managers." Shortly 
after the nation's founding, when party and government officials 
received sugar-coated bullets, most of the time it happened 
passively, but now some of them are actively attracting 
sugar-coated bullets and seeking to be hit. No matter how the 
contents and measures vary, the essence is the same, that is, 
the trading of power for money, abusing public interests for 
private ones, and jeopardizing the state's interests. What is 
more serious is that this phenomenon has already begun to erode 
the tools of people's democratic dictatorship--political and 
judicial organs, and even some of our army units have also been 
affected. This cannot but arouse a high degree of alertness 
among us. 
  Our party's second-generation leadership collective 
inherited 
and developed Comrade Mao Zedong's ideas on resisting corruption 
and advocating clean government, in particular, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping has shown a great deal of concern in this area. In the 
course of reform and opening up, he has always stressed the need 
to do two kinds of work simultaneously, and equally firmly. He 
said: "We must fight corruption in the whole process of reform 
and opening up. To cadres and party members, clean government 
building must be grasped as a big thing." He also demanded that 
senior party cadres play an exemplary role in being uncorrupt 
and exercising self- discipline, including properly disciplining 
their children. He stressed that clean government building must 
rely on the legal system, and that it is still a legal system 
which is more reliable. Based on these expositions by Comrade 
Xiaoping, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee decided to explicitly list strengthening of clean 
government building and the anticorruption drive as the 
necessary conditions and important guarantees for building 
socialist market economy system, holding that this is a big 
matter which has a bearing on the success or failure of the 
reform undertaking, and on the fate of the party and the 
country; the decision reiterated: "The principle of commodity 
exchange is never allowed to be introduced into the party's 
political life or the administrative affairs of state organs for 
the purpose of trading power for money." 
  At present, the whole party and the people in the whole 
country are profoundly implementing the spirit of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and 
expediting development and reform. At the same time, we must 
never become slack in spiritual civilization construction and 
efforts to fight corruption and advocate clean government. We 
should seriously learn from Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings on 
anticorruption and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's relevant expositions, 
and resolutely uphold the principle of doing two kinds of work 
simultaneously and equally firmly, to ensure that our 
undertakings continuously advance along a healthy track!

  [Text] Shanghai, January 10 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing urged local governments to ensure the smooth 
implementation of major measures for deepening reforms. 
  In his recent inspection tour in Shanghai and Zhejiang 
Province, Li called for maintaining social stability, 
stabilizing prices and enhancing the anti-corruption struggle. 
  He said that investment in fixed assets should be controlled 
so as to reduce risk and create a better external environment 
for the reforms. 
  He said that while the new reform measures are carried out, 
special attention must be paid to the problem of inflation. 
Prices should be controlled within a range that the people can 
accept, he added. 
  Toward the end of last year, the vice-premier said, the 
prices of grain and edible oil witnessed a fluctuation. The 
State Council has taken measures necessary to stabilize them. 
  He urged localities to take macro control measures to lower 
the prices of daily-use commodities to reasonable levels. 
  He stressed the development of agriculture and ensuring the 
supplies of agricultural products. 
  The vice-premier said that Shanghai and Zhejiang should make 
new contributions to the development of introducing foreign 
funds and that of internal and external trade. 
  On the question of making use of foreign investment, he said 
that the work on improvement of the investment environment 
should be enhanced and the setting up of the development zones 
should be brought under tight control. 
  One of the major aspects in Li's inspection is to 
investigate 
the development of educational services in the two places. He 
called for attaching importance to education and promoting the 
development of education. 
  During his stay in Shanghai and Zhejiang, Li inspected the 
work of custom offices. He called on the government in the 
coastal regions to enhance the anti-smuggling struggle.

<F P=106> [By special reporter Han Shui (1383 3055): "Li Tieying </F>
Warns Local Authorities Against Intention of Setting Up 
Red-light Districts"] 
  [Text] CPC top leaders recently once again warned local 
officials that they are absolutely not allowed to set up 
red-light districts. Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central 
Political Bureau in charge of cultural affairs, fiercely 
criticized some local officials who thought that "wealth would 
not be increased without prostitution." At present, some 
newspapers in Beijing have been strongly denouncing this opinion. 
  Reportedly, in Guangxi, from Nanning and Beihai to Qinzhou, 
Fangcheng, and Dongxinng, people may find prostitutes 
everywhere. They publicly solicited in the streets without any 
scruples. The scenes startled tourists from other localities 
and seriously affected their mood. A more surprising fact was 
that some local officials regarded this as a "sign of prosperity 
and opening," and held that "this would greatly improve the soft 
environment for investment." Some local officials even more 
boldly advocated the "new conception" that "wealth would not be 
increased without prostitution." It seemed to them that setting 
up a red-light district would be a "new way to get rich." In 
fact, there already exist red-light districts without signboards 
in some coastal cities. 
  Yin Dakui, vice minister of public health, was indignant at 
such a "new conception." Recently, he pointed out that the 
establishment of "red-light districts" would certainly lead to 
the legalization of prostitution, and the appearance of licensed 
prostitutes would not indicate the disappearance of unlicensed 
prostitutes, which would just further increase. The 
legalization of prostitution would bring about extensive 
debauched and promiscuous conduct in society, and venereal 
disease would spread to an out-of-control degree. The main 
measure for controlling venereal disease is still to ban 
prostitution. The idea of "legalizing sexual services" is 
inadvisable and is unsuited to China's national conditions. 
  In the past, Li Tieying also issued an instruction, saying 
that China's prestige was built up on the basis of national 
prosperity and the people's wealth and on the basis of the 
country's economic, scientific, and military strength. China 
should rely on the stable and united environment to attract 
foreign investment and to develop the tourist industry. It must 
never rely on selling out national and personal dignity and 
using vulgar interests to attract foreigners. 
  Recently, Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme 
People's 
Court, strongly denounced, through the mass media, some local 
and departmental leaders for "showing an indifferent attitude 
toward" banning prostitution and "not taking effective measures" 
for doing this. He said that they were afraid of affecting 
external investment and local economic development if they 
thoroughly banned prostitution. As a result, "they did not act 
resolutely, and just turned a blind eye to prostitution 
activities. This inevitably left prostitution unchecked or even 
allow such activities to spread freely." Liu said: In some 
localities, the authorities "only inspected prostitution and did 
not actually ban it, because those who performed the duty of 
inspection would gain benefits by imposing fines on prostitutes 
and their visitors." As a popular saying goes, "detaining 
prostitutes may increase income, and prostitute visitors may be 
released." Liu revealed that "a small number of law enforcement 
personnel are prostitute visitors themselves, and they did not 
pay by using their official functions because prostitutes have 
to seek their protection." He said: "Such ineffective 
management was the key reason why prostitution could not be 
effectively checked and banned." 
  The mainland official mass media also revealed that 
according 
to statistics kept by the information department of the Ministry 
of Public Health, up to the end of 1992, registered patients 
contracting venereal diseases numbered 836,835 people. The 
incidence of venereal diseases increased from 0.00002 percent in 
1981 to 0.01724 percent at the end of 1992. Up to the end of 
November last year, AIDS patients and people infected by the 
AIDS virus numbered 1,159 people, with 14 people being dead. In 
addition, according to statistics by the Ministry of Public 
Security, 201,000 prostitutes were found and detained in 1991; 
and 242,000 prostitutes were found and detained in 1992. If 50 
percent of the prostitutes contracted venereal diseases, then 
more than 200,000 people were infected through this channel.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Dec (XINHUA) -- A national work meeting 
on politics and the law was held in Beijing this morning. Ren 
Jianxin, member of the secretariat and secretary of the Central 
Commission on Politics and Law of the CPC Central Committee, 
pointed out during the meeting: The major tasks of the politics 
and law front in 1994 are to implement the guidelines of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; adhere 
to the strategic principle of "building both material and 
spiritual civilizations and attach equal importance to both"; 
meet the demands of establishing a socialist market economy; 
improve and reform the work of politics and the law; strengthen 
the functions of the people's democratic dictatorship; strike 
resolute blows at hostile forces and crime; step up the 
investigation and handling of major cases during the 
anti-corruption struggle; make great, comprehensive efforts to 
improve public order; provide more effective legal protection to 
socialist market economy; and take a further step toward 
maintaining political and social stability. 
  Luo Gan, state councillor and deputy secretary of the 
Central 
Commission on Politics and Law, presided over the meeting and 
conveyed to it the important instruction on improving the work 
of politics and the law issued recently by the Central Political 
Bureau Standing Committee. Present at the meeting were nearly 
200 responsible people from various provinces, autonomous 
regions, municipalities, the People's Liberation Army, and 
departments concerned. 
  Ren Jianxin said in his speech: The "Decision of the CPC 
Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of 
a Socialist Market Economic Structure," adopted by the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, is China's 
general plan for establishing a socialist market economic 
structure. It is our economic restructuring action program, as 
well as work guidance for our politics and law front. 
  He pointed out: It is necessary to further mobilize the 
force of the whole of society and pay attention to implementing 
measures for comprehensive management of public security in the 
new circumstances. He said: In the new circumstances in which 
we are establishing a socialist market economic structure, the 
comprehensive management of public security must be further 
strengthened, not weakened even a bit. We should continue to 
adhere to the principle of integrating special projects with the 
mass line, mobilize more thoroughly forces in all quarters of 
society to work on projects together at the grass-roots level, 
and implement the measures for comprehensive management of 
public security at the grass-roots level. We should seriously 
study the new situation and new problems at work, overcome 
difficulties and resistance, actively explore, and forge ahead. 
  Ren Jianxin fully affirmed the efforts made by the politics 
and law front in cracking down on crime, maintaining stability, 
and promoting reform, opening up, and economic construction over 
the past year. After analyzing the current situation at home 
and abroad, Ren Jianxin said: Next year will be a very 
important and extremely crucial one for deepening reform and the 
tasks of maintaining stability will be heavier and more urgent. 
Following the continuous deepening of reform and the adjustment 
of the relationship of interests, some new contradictions and 
problems are bound to crop up. We must keep a clear head, 
correctly analyze and size up the situation, be prepared for 
danger in times of peace, and meticulously do a solid job of 
maintaining social and political stability in order that we may 
ensure the smooth development of a socialist market economy. 
  Ren Jianxin said: We must have a correct understanding of 
the dialectical relationship of mutual promotion and mutual 
integration among reform, opening up, economic development, and 
social stability. It is definitely necessary for party and 
government leaders at all levels to persist in the strategic 
principle -- "attach equal importance to promoting reform and 
opening up and to cracking down on all sorts of criminal 
activity, and take a tough stand on both types of work" -- at 
meetings, in documents, and, above all, in action. While 
working successfully to implement reform and promote 
development, they must conscientiously do a good job of building 
spiritual civilization, improving the work of the ideological 
and cultural fronts, and shouldering the political 
responsibility of maintaining stability in a down-to-earth 
manner. 
  Ren Jianxin stressed: We must correctly and properly handle 
the contradictions among the people under the new situation and 
enhance our capability of dealing with every contingency. Party 
and government leaders at all levels must earnestly study the 
characteristics of contradiction among the people under the new 
situation as well as their forms of manifestation, the 
conditions leading to their escalation, preventive measures, and 
the methods to deal with them; they must spend time immersing 
themselves in the masses to resolve contradictions, actively 
prevent their escalation, and solve problems at the level of 
grass roots units in a timely manner before they become too big. 
  Ren Jianxin called on the politics and law front to take an 
active part in the anticorruption struggle and to concentrate 
efforts on investigating and dealing with such big and important 
cases of economic crime as corruption, bribery, and so on. He 
said: As the politics and law departments undertake an important 
task in the anticorruption struggle, they must not fail to 
accomplish their mission and must live up to the expectations of 
the people. It is necessary for party committees at all levels 
and their politics and law commissions to strengthen leadership 
in a down-to-earth manner, directly supervise the handling of 
big and important cases, and support the politics and law 
departments in breaking through various resistance, eliminating 
all interference, and strictly enforcing the law. In compliance 
with party discipline and national laws, they must mete out 
stern punishment to those who stand in the way of the handling 
cases and harbor corrupt elements. 
  Ren Jianxin pointed out: In a sense, there are more problems 
concerning the management of public security now than those in 
the period before the "harsh crackdown" drive was launched in 
1993. Politics and law departments must resolutely correct the 
problem caused by the ineffective crackdown, conscientiously 
raise the level of the "harsh crackdown," and improve its 
results so as to provide an environment in which the masses of 
the people can live and work in peace and contentment. The 
"harsh crackdown" in 1994 must focus on "cracking big cases, 
dealing gangsters a blow, and chasing escaped criminals." 
Directed against problems that stand out, strong and effective 
measures must be taken to organize a concentrated crackdown or 
special struggle to check the momentum of a sharp increase in 
the number of big and abominable cases. 
  In addition, Ren Jianxin also expressed his views on the 
issues of accelerating reform of politics and law work, 
improving the discipline and work style of the political and 
legal contingents, and strengthening and improving the party's 
leadership over the politics and law work.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Mao Lei (3029 4320) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- A five-day national 
conference of presidents of higher courts ended in Beijing 
today. The conferees held: Strict administration of justice by 
the people's courts has a direct bearing on the normal operation 
of a socialist market economic system and the stability of 
market economic order; as well as the dignity and integrity of 
the socialist legal system and the image of the party and the 
government. Therefore, it is a sacred duty of the people's 
courts to strictly administer justice. Courts at various levels 
must regard strict enforcement of law and improved quality of 
justice as a task of primary importance, and make relentless 
efforts to carry out this task. 
  Ren Jianxin, member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central 
Committee and president of the Supreme People's Court, spoke at 
the conference. He said: To ensure strict administration of 
justice, courts at all levels must emancipate minds, seek truth 
from facts, make active exploration, be bold in practice, and 
further strengthen reform and construction of courts 
ideologically, organizationally, institutionally, and in their 
style of work so as to constantly perfect the socialist judicial 
system with Chinese characteristics. 
  He demanded that courts persist in exercising their judicial 
functions independently and under the party's leadership, do 
things strictly according to the law, and resolutely correct 
failure to abide by the law, lax law enforcement, and letting 
law-breakers go free, so as to safeguard the unification of the 
socialist legal system. Meanwhile, it is necessary to train a 
contingent of court personnel who have a strong political 
orientation, professional competence, and solid style of work, 
and who are honest in performing official duties, and strict in 
administering justice. 
  According to briefings, interference from local and 
departmental protectionism have affected the strict enforcement 
of law in the trial of a few cases by the people's courts in 
some localities, thus preventing the courts from bringing into 
full play their judicial functions, and undermining the dignity 
and integrity of the legal system. 
  The conferees called for upholding the principle of open 
trial to effectively guarantee the right of litigants to file 
law suits. It is necessary to conduct open investigation, 
cross-examination, debate, and trial to place the entire 
judicial process under the supervision of the people. 
  The conferees held: The strengthening of judicial 
supervision and enforcement of judicial discipline is an 
important means to guarantee strict administration of justice. 
Courts at all levels must further study and trial-implement a 
system of investigating wronged cases. Personnel liable for 
wrongdoings in handling cases must be affixed with 
administrative and legal responsibilities. Courts at the upper 
level must strengthen supervision over the judicial work of 
courts at the lower level, and must resolutely correct errors 
and unfair verdicts in law enforcement.

<F P=106> ["Special feature" by Mao Mu (5399 2606): "Yang Shangkun </F>
Inspects Shenzhen"] 
  [Text] At noon on 8 January, it was sunny and warm in the 
south. Former state president Yang Shangkun arrived in Shenzhen 
from Beijing by plane for a visit and inspection. 
  The last time Yang Shangkun came he was with Deng on an 
inspection tour of the south, and he arrived in Shenzhen at the 
beginning of 1992. After a year, Yang Shangkun, seeing more and 
greater changes in Shenzhen, was happy beyond description. 
  During his stay in Shenzhen, Yang Shangkun met Li Youwei, 
secretary of the Shenzhen CPC Committee and mayor of the city; 
Yuan Geng, former executive vice chairman of the board of 
directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company 
Limited; Wang Ju, member of the Shenzhen CPC Committee Standing 
Committee; and Xi Zhongxun, who is resting in Shenzhen. 
  On the day of his arrival, Yang Shangkun inspected the 
Shekou 
Industrial Zone. While walking with Yuan Geng, he said that in 
the past decade or so Shekou had advanced by leaps and bounds 
and tremendous changes had taken place. It was no longer the 
small fishing village of 10 years or more before, but an urban 
district of a modern city. The reform and opening up policy 
advocated by Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of reform and 
opening up, was also proved in every way in Shekou to be 
entirely correct! 
  Yuan Geng said that its past appearance had gone for ever! 
  However, Yuan Geng also said that several dilapidated houses 
from those days had been preserved and suggested seeing them on 
another day. 
  Yang Shangkun said they were historical evidence! 
  On Sunday, 9 January, the Sihai Park in Shekou was full of 
people. Yang Shangkun and his party came to the park. They saw 
whole families of residents visiting the park. Some were 
pushing their babies in buggies and children were playing 
happily everywhere. Yang Shangkun was greatly interested in the 
place and walked around for more than half an hour. He praised 
Shekou once more saying that it was like a park and was full of 
life.

  [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One 
Network in Mandarin at 0805 GMT on 5 January broadcasts the 13th 
and last in a series of 13 lectures on "Deng Xiaoping's Theory 
of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics." An 
editorial reporet describing the content of the 12th lecture in 
the series was published in the Political &amp; Social section of 
the 7 January China DAILY REPORT, page 12. 
  The 13th lecture, which lasts for 25 minutes, is entitled: 
"Further Strengthen Party Building According to the Requirements 
of the 14th CPC National Congress," and is given by Dai Zhou, 
director of the Propaganda Bureau under the Propaganda 
Department of the CPC Central Committee. 
  The last lecture begins by underlining the important role of 
the CPC in leading the Chinese people to establish a socialist 
market economy and achieve the second-step strategic goal of 
quadrupling the gross national product by the end of this 
century. Therefore, Dai maintains, it is imperative to build 
the party into a strong core of leadership in the great 
undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Discussing measures for strengthening party building, Dai 
stresses: Efforts must be made to persistently take Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as the basic guideline in strengthening the 
building of the party in accordance with its basic line. 
Moreover, it is necessary to strictly handle party affairs to 
consolidate a high degree of the party's unity organizationally 
and in action. 
  Explaining the significance of party building under the new 
situation of reform and opening up, Dai points out that efforts 
should be made to improve the party's style of work, promote 
clean government, and fight corruption throughout the entire 
process of reform and opening the country to the outside world. 
At 0830 GMT the lecture concludes by calling for continuously 
strengthening and improving party building in the light of new 
circumstances and problems as well as newly-acquired experience.

  [Text] The Chinese authorities in Lhasa have sentenced 12 
nuns to up to seven years in jail for apparently trying to 
organise a pro-independence rally in June last year, sources 
said. 
  The imprisoned nuns, which included a 15-year-old girl, came 
from Garu nunnery, five kilometres north of Lhasa. 
  They were arrested on June 14, 1993. 
  Some sources say that the nuns were arrested before they had 
managed to begin any protest or demonstration. 
  There were no reports of rallies in or near Lhasa that day. 
  Two of the nuns, Ngawang Dedrol, 25, from Chumda township in 
Medrogungkar and Phuntsog Choekyi, 22, from Kache township in 
Phenpo Lhundrup county, were sentenced to seven years in prison, 
according to unofficial sources. 
  Ngawang Keldron, a 19-year-old nun from Meldro Gyama, has 
been jailed for five years. 
  Nine other nuns from Garu received sentences of between two 
and four years. 
  The date of the trial was not known, but it was believed to 
have taken place in the past three months. 
  The Chinese authorities have not issued any statements. 
  All 12 nuns have been moved to Drapchi prison in Lhasa, 
where 
the most serious offenders are held, bringing the total number 
of nuns imprisoned there for political offences to 49, of which 
32 were believed to be nuns from Garu. 
  It is believed that 124 monks and 35 laymen have been held 
in 
Drapchi prison for political offences. 
  Among them was a 15-year-old girl, Gyaltsen Pelsang, who was 
too young to be admitted legally to a prison according to the 
law in China. 
  Two other Garu nuns, Ngawang Yangkyi and Gyaltsen Tsultrim, 
both 22, were also tried and jailed at Drapchi. 
  The two had been arrested after they started a brief pro- 
independence demonstration in the centre of Lhasa on June 4 last 
year. 
  Their sentences are unknown. 
  Within days after the arrest of the 14 nuns, a working team 
of communist officials was sent to the nunnery to begin a 
three-month political education session. 
  There are 90 nuns remaining at Garu.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "More Study, Fewer Social </F>
Appointments--New Year Should Have New Style"] 
  [Text] This year will be the first year for us to 
implement the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee and to build the socialist market economic 
structure according to the blueprint. We will be facing very 
arduous tasks in our way to reform and development. To unite 
and lead the broad masses of people toward this end, our leading 
cadres at all levels must cultivate a new spirit and a new work 
style. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin recently repeatedly emphasized: "I hope 
everybody can spare a little more time for studying, reduce 
social appointments, conduct more investigations and studies to 
avoid subjectivism, and do more practical work while refraining 
from uttering empty words." This is the good style that we 
should vigorously promote in the new year. 
  Constantly enriching one's knowledge and ability, studying 
more, doing more investigations and studies, and doing more 
practical work, all these aspects are linked to each other, and 
none of them is dispensable. Of them the first task is to 
study. Through studying we can constantly obtain new knowledge, 
increase our ability, enhance our ideological and political 
understanding as well as professional competence, and do 
practical work in a better and more effective manner. 
  Nowadays, most leading cadres are aware of the importance of 
studying and they always keep an eye on it. However, still 
there are some comrades who do not attach enough importance to 
study--they either spend much time on processing documents and 
attending meetings, or indulge themselves in all kinds of social 
life. They are busy in welcoming visiting guests and seeing 
them off, accompanying visitors to banquets and on tours. They 
are present on every occasion and meeting, accompanying and 
seeing off visiting superiors, foreign guests, visitors from 
other parts of the country and from other related organizations. 
They believe missing any such single occasion will imply "a 
lack of politeness." Perhaps you may expect that people are 
less fussy when dealing with those within their own areas and 
systems? But you will soon find that you are wrong. Unit A may 
invite you to deliver a speech at a gathering to celebrate the 
successful completion of some project, and you will have to go; 
unit B may invite you to attend and address an anniversary 
party, and you cannot turn it down; unit C may request that you 
preside over a foundation stone laying ceremony, and you cannot 
but accept it; unit D may invite you to cut the ribbon at an 
inaugural ceremony, and still you will have to attend it... 
anyone whose invitation is turned down by you will complain that 
you "are ignoring" them. So, you are busy with social 
appointments all day long and you can hardly concentrate on work 
and study. For a few comrades, although they appear to be 
complaining about the loss of too much time on boring social 
functions, they actually are very fond of these activities. 
Still worse is that they may expect others to entertain them in 
such a fussy manner when they visit other organizations and, in 
particular, their subordinate organs, otherwise they will be 
very unhappy or will go off in a huff. Thus, a "social life 
circle" is formed where everybody tries to please each other by 
inviting each other to or attending social functions. So 
everybody has to spend time and energy on arranging excessive 
social life. Many people may even have to rack their brains to 
work out the arrangement of seats around the dining table. This 
is not only a great waste but also a silly practice. 
  Nowadays as the closed and rigid old structure has been 
broken in the wake of reform and opening-up, every locality, 
department, and organization has established many more external 
ties, and the sense of public relations has been greatly 
enhanced among people. So some social appointments are 
inevitable, some even have become an integral part of work. The 
point is that these activities must be arranged in an 
appropriate and efficient way. Principal leading cadres, in 
particular, should try their best to minimize social 
appointments, or to authorize someone else to attend to such 
social functions on behalf of them. They should learn to 
emancipate themselves from excessive social functions and 
trivial formalities, so they can devote more time to reading 
books and acquiring more new knowledge. 
  What is to be studied? For the moment, we must first 
conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping and thus further prepare ourselves with Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. This is the basis on which we rely for keeping 
a firm stand, distinguishing right from wrong, blazing new 
trails, and establishing ourselves in an unassailable position. 
Under the guidance of this theory, we must bear in mind the 
party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," and study 
and implement well the party's major guiding principles and 
policies. For the time being, we must particularly devote more 
time to studying and implementing the decision adopted by the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, read 
more books on basic theories of the market economy, and thus 
make contributions to the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure. "Knowledge is power." Therefore, apart 
from studying theories and policies, our leading cadres must 
also work hard to acquire knowledge of modern economy, science 
and technology, law, sociology, and other related fields. 
  Some comrades think studying is not so important to them 
since they have received formal education, and they believe 
their knowledge and professional standards are high enough. To 
be sure, since we have been applying the principle of "four 
transformations" to employment of cadres over the past 10 years 
or more, most leading cadres selected and promoted from all 
levels nowadays are of higher academic qualifications and higher 
professional standards. However, appointment can only vest an 
individual with power and duties but will not automatically 
increase his knowledge and ability. The appointed person's 
special qualifications may not necessarily suit the needs of his 
present post, and the knowledge he obtained in the past may not 
necessarily apply to the present and future circumstances. We 
are now in an era of "knowledge explosion." We will be able to 
keep up with the times and constantly improve our leadership 
standards only if we keep on studying hard, seeking new 
knowledge, and improving ourselves. 
  Of course, learning does not mean learning only from books 
but also from practice, and from the masses and other comrades 
as well. So long as our leading comrades at all levels keep a 
high sense of study, make the best use of their time to study, 
and keep the whole leading bodies study very hard, then it will 
be very hopeful for us to further improve our work and open up a 
new prospect.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 Dec (XINHUA) -- On 24 December, the CPC 
Central Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission and the 
Ministry of Supervision jointly issued a "Circular on Making 
Unremitting Efforts To Step Up and Do a Good Job on the CPC 
Central Committee's Three Areas of Anticorruption Struggle in 
the Near Future." Full Text follows: 
  Since the CPC Central Committee and the State Council 
announced an arrangement for anticorruption struggle in the near 
future, various localities and departments have, by taking their 
own reality into consideration, speedily adopted measures to 
implement the arrangement. The momentum for the anticorruption 
drive as a whole has been excellent and the development of the 
anticorruption struggle has been healthy. Some results have 
been achieved in the anticorruption struggle; varying degrees of 
progress have been made in the three areas of anticorruption 
work as set forth by the CPC Central Committee; and negative and 
corrupt phenomena have been checked. But one must see to the 
fact that a lack of balance has so far characterized localities' 
and departments' progress in the anticorruption work; some 
leading cadres have not been serious enough to tackle issues of 
clean administration and to impose self-discipline on 
themselves; some problems that have been exposed during in-house 
checks have not been rectified; more force should be applied in 
the work of investigating major and important cases; the results 
of the drive to rectify unhealthy tendencies are not solid 
enough; and some forms of unhealthy tendencies have not been 
stopped. As the current task of anticorruption struggle remains 
arduous, we should never slacken our vigilance. 
  To further step up and do an even better job in the three 
areas of anticorruption work as demanded by the CPC Central 
Committee and to achieve marked results in various stages, all 
levels of party and government leading bodies, discipline 
inspection, and supervision organs should review and check the 
earlier stage of anticorruption work so as to discover remaining 
shortcomings and weaknesses in the work, and to see if the 
results so far achieved have met with the demands of the CPC 
Central Committee and of the masses. They should, on that 
basis, proceed with defining responsibility and adopting 
measures to specifically implement the three areas of 
anticorruption work. As the period between the present and next 
year's Spring Festival is critical in achieving marked results 
in the anticorruption struggle, localities and departments must 
step up their work. It is necessary for leading cadres to 
further consolidate and expand the results that they have 
achieved in conducting clean administration and in imposing 
self-discipline on themselves. Meetings to discuss democratic 
life of leading bodies at and above county and bureau levels 
should be appropriately reported and leading bodies should 
accept the masses' evaluation and supervision. Problems 
discovered through in-house checks should be properly handled 
according to relevant stipulations. If departments and units 
are found to have not properly done their in-house check and 
self-rectification, or if the masses are not satisfied with the 
results of their in-house check and self-rectification, they 
must seriously make up for it. Verification and investigation 
into the wrong-doing of a very small number of cadres, who incur 
the wrath of the masses and who refuse to conduct 
self-examination and self- rectification, should be conducted 
and handled strictly if their wrong-doings are verified. More 
efforts should be concentrated on investigating major and 
important cases. It is necessary to speedily bring to a close 
self-evident and irrefutable cases, particularly those involving 
leading cadres. Cases which could have a major social impact 
should be selectively made known to the public. It is necessary 
to resolutely deal with those who obstruct investigation of 
cases. We should resolutely stop unhealthy tendencies. 
Continued efforts should be made to deal with problems related 
to illegal collection of fees, and with cases involving those 
who make overseas sightseeing tours at public expense. It is 
important to make timely announcements on cancellation of 
illegal fees collection. Personnel should be organized to check 
and ensure that illegal fees that had been canceled are not 
reintroduced. Leading organs responsible for management of 
professions and trades should do a good job in rectifying 
unhealthy tendencies in various professions and trades. 
  The current stage of anticorruption struggle happens to 
fall during the two holidays of New Year and the Spring 
Festival. The General Office of the CPC Central Committee issued 
"A Circular on the Strict Banning of Feasting, Gift-Giving at 
Public Expense and Waste and Extravagances During the Period of 
1994 New Year and Spring Festival" and reiterated five 
stipulations, which will greatly help promote the implementation 
of the CPC Central Committee's three areas of anticorruption 
work in the near future. All levels of party committees, and 
government, discipline inspection, and supervision organs should 
implement the circular by taking into consideration the reality 
of various localities and various departments. The results of 
the present stage of party- style and clean-administration 
building and of the anticorruption struggle will put our ability 
to spend a clean, joyous, and happy New Year and Spring Festival 
to a real test. It is necessary for discipline inspection and 
supervision organs to do a good job of publicizing the 
"circular," enhancing supervision, and checking on enforcement. 
Discipline must be strictly enforced on those who violate 
discipline, and there should be no appeasement and leniency for 
them. The deeds of those who seriously violate discipline and 
have a very bad influence should be publicized. It is necessary 
to closely integrate the implementation of the "circular's" five 
stipulations with the implementation of the CPC Central 
Committee's three areas of anticorruption work in the near 
future. We must produce marked results in this stage of the 
anticorruption struggle. 
  In addition to doing a good job of the above work, all 
levels 
of party committees and government discipline inspection and 
supervision organs should, following the Spring Festival, 
organize personnel to conduct investigation, study, and work out 
plans for the next stage of the anticorruption work. Following 
the Spring Festival, the Discipline Inspection Commission under 
the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Supervision plan 
to work out arrangements for the next stage of the 
anticorruption struggle.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter He Jun: "State Looks Overseas To Boost </F>
Universities"] 
  [Text] The government is considering foreign help to 
expand higher education, an official with the State Education 
Commission (SEC) said yesterday. 
  The SEC has already received nine applications to set up 
solely foreign-funded institutes or branches of foreign 
universities, said the commission's Cao Guoxing. 
  A rapidly increasing number of foreign schools, enterprises 
and individuals is also applying to jointly establish or operate 
schools, he said. 
  Though no exact statistics are available, many 
jointly-operated and solely foreign-funded schools have opened 
across the country, offering short-term training and vocational 
courses. 
  These foreign partners include overseas Chinese, foreign 
schools, and business people, Cao said. 
  The SEC is working hard to draft regulations to ensure a 
smooth and healthy development of co-operation, he said. 
  No Sino-foreign higher-education projects have been 
empowered 
to hand out degrees, he added. 
<H5>  Power </H5>
  Cao stressed that only the SEC has the power to do so while 
provincial governments and ministries can authorize lower-level 
projects. 
  Co-operative projects have mushroomed in recent years, 
creating disorder, and some were started without proper approval. 
  Cao urged governments to work out more regulations to 
strengthen their control of the projects and guide future 
development. 
  Co-operation helps develop China's educational system as the 
projects introduce new management schemes, advanced teaching 
methods and more funds, said Cao. 
  However, he advised a cautious approach, especially in 
higher- education, because of education's far-reaching influence 
in society. 
  He stressed that China should have the decisive role in the 
projects. 
  He also said there was a major gap in understanding between 
domestic and foreign education systems. 
  Before any projects are launched, the foreign side should be 
well informed of China's educational system, policies and 
demands. 
  And the Chinese should do more research into the partner's 
background and educational standards, he added. 
  None of the projects should be profit-oriented, he said, and 
any extra cash should be used only to improve education 
facilities and teachers' living standards. 
  Cao said the SEC would allow no foreign party to get 
involved 
in running Chinese primary and high schools, but it would 
welcome donations from foreign organizations and individuals to 
support their development. 
  The SEC encouraged local authorities to establish more 
"international schools" specially for the children of foreign 
diplomats and business people working in joint ventures, so as 
to fulfill increasing demand. 
  Such schools are now available in cities like Beijing,

  [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- China's Justice 
Ministry announced today that residents from Taiwan, Hong Kong 
and Macao will be allowed to participate in the national lawyer 
qualification tests this year. 
  Vice-Minister of Justice Wang Julu said at a news conference 
today that the move is aimed to promote the cooperation and 
exchange between the mainland lawyers and lawyers from those 
areas. 
  "This will provide legal service for the economic exchange 
and cooperation between the mainland and areas of Taiwan, Hong 
Kong and Macao," Wang said. 
  It is also a reform measure for China's lawyer system, he 
added. 
  This measure is responding to requests by lawyers and legal 
experts from those places to know the mainland legal system and 
legal background, he said. 
  The requests come as China is to resume its sovereignty over 
Hong Kong and Macao, and the pace of unification across the 
straits is being stepped up, Wang said. 
  They asked for permits to take part in the national lawyer 
qualification test and obtain mainland certificates, so that 
they can defend "certain cases under certain regulations," 
according to Wang. 
  Residents from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao must meet the 
same 
requirements as residents on the mainland to participate in the 
test, the vice-minister said. 
  They include that the candidates must endorse the 
Constitution of the People's Republic, have no criminal record, 
no serious mental illness or other serious illness, and are 
above the age of 23. 
  One exception was made on credential qualifications due to 
the different legal and educational systems in these areas. 
  The Justice Ministry decided that those with college 
credentials issued by China's State Educational Commission are 
allowed to take part in the test. 
  Wang said that his ministry will run training seminars for 
residents from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao to enable them to 
have a systematic knowledge of China's legal system. 
  He said a "Chinese lawyer training class" will be held in 
Hong Kong on January 17 this year jointly by the National 
Examination Center on Lawyer Qualification, the Law School of 
the People's University of China from Beijing and Shu Yan 
College of Hong Kong. 
  He said that people from those areas who passed the test 
will 
be licensed to practise after the required practical experience 
and passing proficiency assessments.

development of the CPC, as well as to the People's Liberation 
Army, the victory of the cause of liberation of people of all 
nationalities of China, the PRC's founding, and the development 
of the socialist cause in China. He made great contributions to 
the emancipation of the oppressed nations in the world and the 
cause of the progress of mankind. Comrade Mao Zedong's life was 
one of continuously exploring truth; it was a life of selfless 
struggle for national independence, for the people's liberation, 
and for the country's prosperity." Yin went on to praise Mao 
Zedong Thought and the party's first-generation collective 
leadership with Comrade Mao Zedong as its representative, and 
called for adhering to and developing Marxism-Leninism-Mao 
Zedong Thought, uniting closely around the Central Committee

  [Text] According to statistics provided by the provincial 
statistical bureau, in 1993 Fujian's GNP was estimated at 95.349 
billion yuan, an increase of 25.4 percent over the previous year 
as calculated on comparable prices, being the second top 
production year since the founding of the PRC and also the top 
production year since the introduction of reform and opening up, 
thus quadrupling the 1980 strategic objective seven months ahead 
of schedule. 
  Yesterday the provincial government held a news briefing to 
report on the above situation. In the meantime, the news 
briefing pointed out: There are still outstanding problems in 
the province's current economic life. Its agricultural 
foundation is still weak, market price increases are 
comparatively high, the investment structure is not quite 
rational, funds are still short of supply, and agricultural 
production is proceeding with difficulties.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 8 (AFP)--A gas explosion ripped 
through a mine in the northeastern Chinese province of 
Heilongjiang in October, killing 70 miners, THE WORKERS' DAILY 
[GONGREN RIBAO] revealed Saturday. 
  The blast was sparked by a short circuit in the wiring 
system, igniting gas that had been allowed to build up in the 
shaft by the failure of the mine's ventilation system, the 
newspaper said. 
  All 70 miners working in the shaft at the time of the 
explosion were killed, it added. 
  The explosion at the Baohe mine followed a similar blast 
there in January 1991 that killed 53 workers. 
  Industrial accidents claimed 11,600 lives in China last 
year, 
more than double the 1992 figure.

  [Text] British Minister with special responsibility for 
Hong Kong Alistair Goodlad will meet legislators this morning 
for talks on the plight of Hong Kong's 6,000 ethnic minority 
residents after 1997. 
  Goodlad arrived in Hong Kong yesterday for a three-day visit 
to discuss Hong Kong's political future with Governor Chris 
Patten and the Executive Council. 
  His arrival came as British opposition spokesman on foreign 
affairs Jack Cunningham announced he would meet Chinese leaders 
in Beijing later this month for talks on Hong Kong's future. 
  While China has virtually severed ties with British and Hong 
Kong officials it has approved the visit by Britain's Labour 
spokesman on the territory. 
  Cunningham will meet Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu and 
head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping, as well 
as other Chinese leaders. 
  Cunningham will also visit Hong Kong for talks with 
political 
and business leaders, including Patten. 
  Goodlad's visit comes 10 days before Patten flies to London 
to meet Prime Minister John Major to discuss the next moves over 
Hong Kong's political future. 
  Goodlad said he hoped there would be further talks with 
China 
over constitutional reform despite China's threat to disband the 
legislature after 1997. 
  "We would think it would be highly desirable that there 
should be a through train and we hope to continue discussions 
with the Chinese side on that subject," Goodlad said. 
  "We very much hope there would be further talks on the 
important subjects for the prosperity and the stability of Hong 
Kong." 
  The minister had a one-hour meeting with Patten and spoke to 
Executive Councillors yesterday as well as attending a cocktail 
party with Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod and some of 
Hong Kong's leading businessmen. 
  Goodlad will go to the new airport site as well as visiting 
the Black Point power station in Tuen Mun today. 
  But this morning Goodlad will confront the Legislative 
Council's Nationality Committee to explain why the British 
government has refused to grant citizenship to more than 6,000 
ethnic minority residents who will be left stateless after 1997. 
  Topping the agenda will be the move by the House of Lords to 
give non-Chinese ethnics [as published] the right of abode in 
Britain. 
  The bill, which was introduced by Lord Bonham-Carter last 
month, has majority support in the House of Lords but will be 
blocked by the government in the House of Commons. 
  Committee chairman and independent legislator Emily Lau said 
she wanted Goodlad to explain the government's position over the 
controversial legislation. 
  "Like a bad penny, we'll keep showing up," she said.

  [Text] Shanghai, Jan. 11 KYODO -- China's paramount 
leader Deng Xiaoping met conservative former party leader Chen 
Yun Tuesday [11 January] for about 90 minutes at a hotel here, 
witnesses said. 
  They said Deng, who has reportedly been staying in Shanghai 
since December for relaxation, arrived by car at the hotel where 
Chen, who has often taken a cautious stance toward reform, was 
staying. 
  This was Deng's third reported outing since the 89-year-old 
architect of China's economic reforms moved to the Chinese 
coastal commercial city. 
  Chen, a long-time economic leader and later chief of the 
party's Central Advisory Committee in the 1980s, has been 
staying in the metropolis from around summer last year. 
  A Beijing-funded newspaper in Hong Kong reported Monday that 
Deng had made a rare public appearance on New Year's day, 
visiting a five-star Shanghai hotel and chatting with foreign 
guests.

  [Text] On 5 January, the highest daily temperature in 
Harbin was only 17 degrees below zero centigrade, and the entire 
city proper was covered with a thick layer of snow. Harbin 
Bearing Plant was swept very clean to greet the arrival of a 
distinguished guest. 
  At about 0930 that morning, Comrade Li Ruihuan, standing 
committee member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, got off a van at a 
half step and walked to Harbin Bearing Plant. After looking at 
the operation situation of workers one after another, he stopped 
beside Yang Jingyu, a young female worker, and cordially asked: 
How many years have you worked for this plant? Yang Jingyu 
answered: Three years. Li Ruihuan asked again: How much do 
you earn per month? Yang answered: One hundred and six yuan. If 
bonuses and subsidies are added, it totals 190 yuan. At the 
maximum, it had reached 370 to 380 yuan. At the plant's meeting 
room, when Comrade Li Ruihuan again mentioned the issue of 
wages, workers realized that Li Ruihuan was not casual in asking 
about the questions concerning wages, and he was always 
concerned with the livelihood of the masses. Ma Jibo, director 
of the plant, told Li Ruihuan bluntly: The average annual 
income of workers is 4,000 yuan. Li Ruihuan nodded and said: 
It is not much. The workers' income is connected with the 
development of enterprises and with the stability of the society 
and public feeling. What attracted the interests of Comrade Li 
Ruihuan was how state-owned enterprises, large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises in particular, should strive for 
development under the new historical condition. Ma Jibo gave Li 
Ruihuan a detailed briefing of the plant's situation in 
importing funds and technology and in carrying out renovation 
through grafting. Then, Li Ruihuan said happily: I agree with 
your method. This is a way out for large- and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises. The three major power plants in Harbin 
can also be like that after renovation. 
  Li Ruihuan added: Your products occupy a certain place and 
have a sort of monopoly on domestic markets. The state 
precisely wants to foster a number of enterprises like you to 
develop major fine and highly sophisticated products. There are 
only several big plants producing power generating and boiler 
facilities in the world. Our special technology and 
installations cannot be compared with others. These remarks 
inspired the workers of the plant. 
  At 1010, Comrade Li Ruihuan arrived at Harbin Engineering 
College. The way to the meeting room was filled with teachers, 
staff members, and workers. Yang Shiqin, president of Harbin 
Engineering Plant, briefed Comrade Li Ruihuan on the situation 
of the scientific and technological park zone of Harbin 
Engineering College. Yang said: At the scientific and 
technological park zone, that was established a year ago, dozens 
of scientific research results have already been industrialized, 
and another group of scientific research results are under rapid 
transformation. After hearing this, Comrade Li Ruihuan was very 
satisfied with it, and discussed with college teachers and staff 
on how to combine education and scientific research with 
production. Li Ruihuan said: How good is the phrase [words 
indistinct]. But, it is useless because nobody follows it. 
There are no such phrases in foreign countries, but they work 
in good order. It will not do to shout slogans. These remarks 
set college teachers and staff roaring with laughter. After 
laughing, they pondered over what Li Ruihuan said. With regard 
to the questions of combining education and scientific research 
with production and in many other questions, we should not offer 
questions merely but should also strive to find out answers. It 
will not do to shout empty slogans. What is important is to 
deal with concrete matters. 
  During the discussion, some comrades also pointed out: The 
things will be better if enterprises can join hands with 
universities and colleges in the fields of tackling 
technological difficulties and improving the technology content 
of products. Comrade Li Ruihuan was much interested in this 
suggestion. Then, he encouraged college teachers and staff to 
exert great efforts in working out a system of combining 
education, science, technology, and production. After this, 
Comrade Li Ruihuan visited the scientific hall of the college 
with great interest. He said: Here is the world of robots. 
When a robot wrote welcome with its machinery hand on the spot, 
Comrade Li Ruihuan nodded and praised it repeatedly. 
  At the scientific and technological market that was about to 
start business at the scientific and technological park zone, 
President Yang Shiqin walked to Comrade Li Ruihuan with a 
gilding certificate on his hand, and invited Li Ruihuan as 
honorary adviser to the scientific and technological park zone 
of Harbin Engineering College. Comrade Li Ruihuan happily 
accepted the invitation, and this garnered warm applause of 
college teachers, staff, and workers.

  [Text] The three-day seminar on the strategy for building 
Harbin into an important international economic and trade city 
of Northeast Asia ended on the afternoon of 8 January. 
Attending the seminar were Li Ruihuan, standing committee 
member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference; Li Peiyao, vice chairman of 
the National People's Congress; and Sun Weiben, Shao Qihui, and 
Zhou Wenhua, leaders of Heilongjiang Province. 
  The specialists and scholars attending this seminar

has an age-old tradition of economic, trade, and cultural flows 
with foreign countries, solid scientific and technological 
strength, extensive international contacts, convenient 
communications and transportation facilities, and a flourishing 
and brisk market. In particular, the economic foundation based 
on relatively strong comprehensive functions and the favorable 
domestic and international economic environment make it 
completely possible for Harbin to become an important 
international economic and trade city. 
  At the closing ceremony held on the afternoon of 8 January, 
Suo Changyou, mayor of Harbin city, expressed in his speech: We 
should translate the achievements of this seminar to the 
development plans of Harbin city as quickly as possible, should 
strive to enhance Harbin people's understanding of the 
significance in building the important international economic 
and trade city of Northeast Asia, and should make concerted 
efforts to march toward the goal of building an important 
international economic and trade city of Northeast Asia.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yin Xuecheng (3009 1331 2052)] </F>
  [Text] Nanjing, 18 Dec (XINHUA) -- During his inspection 
of Jiangsu's Huaiyin Prefecture, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of 
the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC 
Central Committee, stressed: Deepening rural reform and 
developing the rural economy is the basic requirement for the 
economy to develop rapidly and in a sustained and healthy manner 
[chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan he zheng ge gai ge kai fang 
shun li jin xing 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455 0735 
2419 0020 2395 7245 7030 2397 7311 0448 6651 5887], and for the 
entire reform and opening up to advance smoothly. In the course 
of building a socialist market economic system, we should regard 
as an important task supporting major grain and cotton 
production areas in developing their economies and ensuring a 
steady increase in grain and cotton production; we should ensure 
that this task is properly carried out. 
  From 13 to 18 December, Wen Jiabao inspected the 
agricultural 
production and rural work and visited peasant households in 
Suqian, Shuyang, Hongze, Jinhu, and other cities and counties of 
Huaiyin City, and held discussions with local cadres on issues 
concerning the current rural reform and development. 
  Over the last few years, while ensuring a steady increase in 
grain production, Huaiyin City, located in the heartland of 
northern Jiangsu, has made use of local resources to forcefully 
develop a diversified economy and the processing of agricultural 
and sideline products, opening up a path for rural economic 
development that is in line with local reality and bringing 
about big changes in local rural areas. Wen Jiabao fully 
approved Huaiyin Prefecture's experience in agricultural and 
rural economic development and offered his opinions on deepening 
rural reform. He said: Rural reform is an important part of our 
efforts to build a socialist market economic system. From the 
very beginning, China's rural reform has been market-oriented. 
It has two important characteristics: First, peasants are given 
full decision-making powers such as what to produce and how to 
deal with their products to rally the masses of peasants' 
enthusiasm. Second, the agriculture and rural economy have been 
made market-oriented to give play to market mechanism. 
Actually, these are a successful practice of building a new 
socialist market economic system in rural areas. To continue to 
deepen rural reform, currently we need to do a good job in the 
following three areas: First, while making the household 
contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to 
output more firmly established and making efforts to refine the 
system, we should strive to budget rural economic resources in 
the optimum manner and to enable production elements to flow 
more freely. Second, we should develop rural markets, invigorate 
rural circulation, and take various measures to link the 
decentralized productions of individual households to a unified 
market. Third, the government should provide better guidance 
for agricultural production, give greater support and protection 
to it, strengthen regulation and control over it, and develop a 
better socialized service system. Wen Jiabao continued: Next 
year is a crucial year for our reform; various major reform 
measures will be instituted next year. We must place importance 
on rural work, strengthen agriculture's position as the 
foundation of the national economy, ensure a steady growth in 
grain and cotton production, ensure the supply of agricultural 
and sideline products, and ensure a stable market of these 
products to create a favorable economic climate and a stable 
social environment for the reform. 
  Commenting on the fact that Huaiyin City had reaped bumper 
grain harvests in the past few years but its peasants' income 
had been comparatively low, Wen Jiabao pointed out: Major grain 
and cotton production areas are extremely important to the 
country's grain and cotton production; therefore, we should take 
effective measures to speed up these areas' economic 
development. First, we should regulate the current grain and 
cotton prices by implementing reasonable price policies, so to 
reasonably raise the relatively low prices and to improve the 
relative economic efficiency of grain and cotton production. 
Second, while ensuring a steady increase in grain and cotton 
production, we should make the rural industrial structures more 
rational; should forcefully develop a diversified economy and 
town and village enterprises in rural areas -- in particular, we 
should develop the livestock and poultry industry and the 
processing of agricultural and sideline products; and should 
choose the development path of combining efforts to increase 
production and to develop value-added processing industries. 
Third, governments at all levels should appropriately pool 
their financial resources to support economic development of 
major grain and cotton production areas. 
  Wen Jiabao stressed: The key to deepening rural reform and 
to 
accelerating the economic development in major grain and cotton 
production areas is to have good leaders. Party members and 
grass-roots cadres in rural areas not only should take the lead 
in getting better of, but also should lead the masses to achieve 
common prosperity. He urged grass-roots cadres in rural areas 
to earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, to carry through the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and the Central Rural Work Meeting, to emancipate 
their minds, seek truth from facts, be self-reliant, work hard 
to pioneer new spheres of endeavors, and further advance rural 
reform and economic development. 
  Those accompanying Wen Jiabao during his inspection tour 
included Cao Hongmin, deputy secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial 
CPC Committee; and Wan Baorui, vice minister of agriculture.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chen Xiao: "Experts Stress Enforcement"] </F>
  [Text] It is encouraging that China is pulling out all the 
stops to reform the banking sector, government finance and 
State-owned enterprises this year. 
  While the reform packages are designed to support a market 
economy, it may be hard to carry them out smoothly. 
  Since this year's reforms are vital, economists have warned 
the central government about possible problems that may emerge. 
Some departments may misunderstand the reform messages and 
others may fail to carry out changes to safeguard their vested 
interests. 
  Economists said these actions could ruin the central 
government's reform plan. 
  Also, an eye should be kept on the economy to prevent it 
from 
overheating, which will lead to high inflation. 
  Chinese entrepreneurs and overseas experts are apparently 
more optimistic about China's reforms. They say changes are 
inevitable. 
  Their view is based on the past 15 years of reform 
experience. Each time reform steps were taken, many people, 
particularly economists, were worried. But in the end the 
packages turned out basically well. 
  "We have longed for such audacious reforms (of 1994) for 
years and the programme looks good," economist Wu Jinglian told 
China Daily over the weekend. Wu is a senior researcher with 
the Development and Research Centre, a major think tank of the 
State Council. 
  But Wu warned about possible problems: "Reforms in some 
fields are being undertaken by the same people and organizations 
that are accustomed to the planned economy. 
  "As there is no model for them to copy to create a socialist 
market economy, they could distort the reforms in practice," he 
said. 
  Another problem is some people who are opposed to reform. 
Although they do not openly voice their dissatisfaction, they 
try to slow the reform process down in every possible way, Wu 
said. 
  More dangerous, however, are those who flaunt the banner of 
reform while sabotaging or illegally profiting from programmes. 
  "They have taken advantage of loopholes of reform at its 
initial stage," Wu said. "They are setting and seeking rents to 
pocket money by using their administrative powers in the 
immature market." 
  These people hope the market does not open wider and refuse 
to support laws and regulations governing market activities. 
  Wu said such types of people could be found last year in the 
banking and real estate sectors. 
  "It is hoped that new laws which have been issued, or are to 
be announced, will prevent such loopholes," Wu said. 
  At the same time, the relationship between the central and 
local governments should be improved because further reforms, 
especially financial ones, focus on re-distributing money 
between them. 
  If localities resent sending the central government more 
money, the reforms will fail. 
  In fact, central authorities, to avoid friction, have 
promised that this year's financial reform will not dampen 
regional interests. 
  Observers say the announcement will console local officials 
and decrease the cost of reform. 
  "No matter how difficult it will be, reforms in finance and 
taxation must be pushed ahead," said Ding Ningning, an economist 
with the Development and Research Centre. 
  Most economists agree with Wu that the success of reforms, 
no 
matter how cleverly devised, depends on enforcement. 
  Fan Hengshan, of the State Commission for Restructuring the 
Economic System, said "risks co-exist with success since this 
year's reform steps are the biggest. 
  "There is the possibility that things may go contrary to our 
wishes when enforcement is carried out. This requires subtle 
handling." 
  Another possible problem is that an overheated economy may 
upset a calm reform environment. 
  This year's plan has set the fastest pace ever for China's 
growth and reforms. 
  It requires the central government to keep control over the 
economy and a vigilant eye on inflation. 
  Ding believes it will be difficult to achieve this goal. 
  Control of the money supply has been relaxed since last 
September, when most State-owned enterprises were crying for 
funds. 
  According to the State Statistics Bureau, banks increased 
69.8 billion yuan ($8.0 billion) of loans as working capital to 
industrial enterprises between September and November last year. 
During the same period in 1992, the figure was only 25.2 billion 
yuan ($2.9 billion). 
  With the increase in lending, industry grew 29.8 percent 
last 
December as against the same month of 1992. This was the second 
highest monthly growth rate registered in 1993. 
  Industrial analysts say this is not great news because 
growth 
is too high for a period of economic readjustment. 
  The readjustment programme started last July when the 
central 
government issued a package of measures to cool down the 
overheating economy. 
  Finally, rapid growth fueled by huge investments may 
translate into high inflation. 
  "Unwanted high inflation may emerge around the third quarter 
of this year if the central government fails to control the 
economy effectively," said Wu Jinglian. 
  Meanwhile, the elimination of the two-tiered foreign 
exchange 
rate system has raised the likelihood of inflation. 
  If prices run out of control, the central government will 
have to shift its attention and efforts from reform to fighting 
inflation. 
  This may strand reforms. 
  China experienced this in the late 1980s. At that time, the 
central government tightened control of the economy, which was 
then followed by a slow growth rate and a delay in further 
reforms. 
  "It seems that the central government has drawn a lesson 
from 
this as it reaffirmed it would continue to enhance its macro 
control over the economy," said Fan Hengshan.

Commission for Restructuring Economic Systems: "China's 
Economic Reform in 1994"] 
  [Text] The year 1994 will bring all-round reform of 
China's economic systems and breakthroughs in some key areas in 
line with the basic framework of a socialist market economic 
structure. 
  In 1993, decisive steps were taken in the effort to reform 
China's economic systems, particularly in displaying the role of 
the market, with substantial progress being recorded in many 
areas. For instance, since last May, more that 90 percent of 
the country's counties and cities have opened their grain and 
oil market prices and abolished the food grain rationing system 
which had been in place for more than four decades. 
Simultaneously, price controls were lifted on iron and steel 
and a certain amount of coal subject to the government's unified 
allocation plan. In addition, the price of some crude oil was 
readjusted. As a result, the proportion of prices fixed by the 
state accounted for only 5 percent of the total retail sales 
volume of commodities, 10 percent of the total sales volume of 
farm produce, and 15 percent of the total sales volume of 
industrial capital goods. The gross industrial output value of 
the state mandatory plan dropped to around 5 percent. 
  In line with the basic framework of the socialist market 
economic structure adopted during the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held 
last November, China will advance reforms in a comprehensive 
manner and strive to make breakthroughs in some key areas during 
1994. Priority will be placed on establishing a modern 
enterprise system; a unified, open, competitive and orderly 
market system; a macroeconomic control system; a rational social 
distribution system; and a multilayered social security system. 
<H5>  Establishing a Modern Enterprise System </H5>
  Required tasks include: 
  -- Continuing to implement the Law Concerning Industrial 
Enterprises Owned by the Whole People and the Regulations on 
Changing the Management Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises 
Owned by the Whole People so as to transform enterprises into 
genuine economic entities which engage in independent management 
and assume sole responsibility for profits and losses; 
  -- Defining property rights relationships, strengthening the 
supervision and management of the property of state-owned 
enterprises, promoting the pilot project for the establishment 
of standard shareholding companies, experimenting with the 
corporate system in enterprises with appropriate conditions by 
introducing into them such forms of operation and organization 
as exclusively Chinese or foreign funded companies, limited 
liability companies and joint stock companies, and restructuring 
existing companies in line with standard requirements; 
  -- Reforming and improving the leading body, and 
organizational and management systems of enterprises; 
  -- Continuing to improve the organizational structure of 
enterprises, developing large enterprise groups, optimizing the 
organizational structure of enterprises by implementing the 
Bankruptcy Law and using methods such as contract management, 
leasing and auctions, and encouraging small enterprises to 
introduce share holding system or set up partnership enterprises; 
  -- Adopting concrete measures to reduce the excessive tax 
load and social burden on enterprises in combination with the 
reform of fiscal, taxation, monetary and social security 
systems. The state will choose 100 enterprises to conduct 
different types of experiments in line with their specific 
conditions and characteristics; 
  -- Encouraging various localities to explore effective 
enterprise management mechanisms on the precondition of 
preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets. 
<H3>  Forming a Unified, Open, Competitive and Orderly Market 
System </H3>
  The aim is to give play to the market's basic role in the 
allocation of resources. The main tasks in this area include: 
  -- Developing production factors markets, including 
monetary, 
labor force, real estate, technology and information markets. 
  -- Reforming the price management system and promoting the 
establishment of market price formation mechanisms. 
  -- Improving the commodity circulation system, continuing to 
develop wholesale markets, and conducting experiments with the 
establishment of a few commodity futures markets. 
  -- Promoting modern means of circulation. 
  -- Actively developing intermediate organizations, such as 
accounting, auditing and legal offices notarial and arbitration 
organizations, organizations for measurement and quality 
inspection and licensing, information and consultant 
organizations, and credit rating organizations. At the same 
time, emphasis will be placed on giving full play to the active 
roles of chambers of commerce and various other associations. 
  -- Continuing to tighten legislation and strengthen 
construction of the legal system related to the market. 
<H5>  Reform of the Monetary System </H5>
  Ideas for the reform in this area include: 
  -- Strengthening the role of the People's Bank of China as 
the central bank responsible for implementing monetary policies 
independently under the leadership of the State Council, 
regulating and controlling the money supply and supervising and 
maintaining financial order by implementing economic measures 
such as a reserve ratio on deposits, the lending rates of the 
central bank and open market operations. 
  -- Organizing a monetary policy committee. 
  -- Separating policy-related businesses from commercial 
operations, organizing the National Development Bank and Import 
and Export Credit Bank, reorganizing the Agricultural Bank of 
China, transforming existing specialized banks into commercial 
banks, and organizing rural and urban cooperative banks; 
  -- Adopting modern bank management methods. 
<H5>  Reform of Fiscal and Taxation Systems </H5>
  The reform effort calls for standardizing the fiscal and tax 
management systems, and emphasizing the active roles of fiscal 
and taxation policies for regulating overall demand and supply, 
readjusting social economic structures and social distribution. 
Principal measures to be introduced include: 
  -- Replacing the current local fiscal contract 
responsibility 
system with the tax assignment system on the basis of a rational 
division of power between central and local authorities, and 
defining the categories of taxes as central, local and shared. 
  -- Increasing the percentage of fiscal income in relation to 
the gross national product and the percentage of the central 
fiscal in come in the nation's total fiscal income. 
  -- Introducing a double budget system, establishing a 
government public budget and a budget for management of state 
assets. Fiscal deficits of central authorities will no longer 
be met by bank overdrafts. 
  -- Reforming the taxation system by promoting a turnover tax 
system based on a value-added tax, reducing the excessively high 
income tax rate (55 percent) imposed on state-owned enterprises, 
and discontinuing construction funds for key energy and 
communications projects, as well as nonbudgeted regulation funds. 
  -- Unifying and standardizing enterprise income tax and 
personal income tax, and rationalizing the distribution 
relationship between the state and state-owned enterprises on 
the basis of a reduced income tax rate for state-owned 
enterprises. 
<H5>  Reform of the Planning System </H5>
  The guiding thought for this reform is to base state 
planning 
on the market, with emphasis on the improvement of guidance 
plans. Efforts will include: 
  -- Establishing a new national economic accounting system 
and 
macroeconomic monitoring and warning systems. 
  -- Effectively using the coordinative role of macroeconomic 
policies and economic levers, with the stress on drafting medium 
and long-term plans. 
<H5>  Reform of the Investment System </H5>
  The main tasks of reform will be to define the main body of 
investment and its scope of responsibilities in terms of 
investment in different sectors, gradually establishing risk 
liability for corporate investments and bank credits, 
establishing respective investment spheres for the government 
and enterprises, developing the regulatory role of the market to 
investment and financing, and establishing incentive and control 
mechanisms. Major tasks include: 
  -- Encouraging investment and financing activities by 
applying the state's industrial policies, financial bonds, 
interest rates, exchange rates and other economic levers, and 
developing the roles of the National Development Bank and other 
policy-related banks. 
  -- Widely using fund-raising methods such as the holding and 
acquisition of shares and the issuance of financial bonds. 
  -- Replacing the existing system of administrative 
examination and approval of construction projects with a system 
of project registration, introducing different forms of 
investment for general commercial competitive projects, 
infrastructure projects, key state construction projects and 
public welfare projects, and displaying the role of the market 
by increasing the use of economic levers and measures. 
<H5>  Reform of the Foreign Trade System </H5>
  The goal of expediting the reform of the foreign trade 
system 
is to accelerate the pace of opening to the outside world, bring 
China's domestic economy into line with the international 
economy, and enhance China's competitive capacity on the 
international market. The basic requirements for the reform are 
to unify policies, liberalize management, encourage equal 
competition, allow enterprises to assume responsibilities for 
their own profits and losses, integrate industry with trade and 
promote an agency system. 
  The main measures to be adopted include: 
  -- Transforming the management mechanisms of enterprises 
(chiefly those involved in foreign trade), reforming existing 
enterprises in line with the modern enterprise system, and 
energetically developing transnational industrialized 
comprehensive trading conglomerates. 
  -- Improving the state's management of foreign trade by 
adopting measures such as exchange rates, tariffs and credit, 
abolishing mandatory planning for import and export commodities, 
and standardizing the distribution of the import and export 
quotas for commodities through bidding and auction. 
  -- Lowering the general level of tariffs and constantly 
optimizing the structure of tariffs. 
  -- Actively promoting the strategies of gaining a greater 
share of the market with quality products and developing plural 
markets. 
  -- Constantly improving and perfecting a unified foreign 
economic legislation system, reforming the foreign exchange 
control system, establishing a market based floating exchange 
rate control system, and gradually converting the Renminbi into 
a convertible currency. 
  In addition, a rational system of income distribution to 
individuals and a multi-layered social security system will be 
established according to the principles of placing priority on 
efficiency while taking fairness into account. Simultaneously, 
a large amount of meticulous work must be done to reform the 
scientific, technological and educational systems, and to 
strengthen legislation and the legal system to ensure their 
compatibility with a socialist market economy.

<F P=106> ["XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Letterbox: How To Reform and Improve </F>
Existing Industry and Commerce Taxation System? -- Through the 
Publicity Office of the State Administration of Taxation"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Dec (XINHUA) -- The basic framework of 
our country's existing industry and commerce taxation system was 
established in 1984 through the implementation of a taxation 
system instead of the system of profit payments to the state, as 
well as reform in the industry and commerce taxation system. 
The traces of Chinese household administrative methods for 
economic management under the planned economy model are notably 
retained. To meet the needs of market economic development, it 
is necessary to deepen reform in the taxation system in 
accordance with the principle of unified tax law, fair 
tax-sharing, simplified taxation system, and rational power 
distribution. 
  First, it is possible to better uphold tax management in 
accordance with the law and exercise authority in tax collection 
only with a unified taxation law. A unified taxation law is not 
only conducive to breaking down man-made boundaries separating 
regions and to establishing fair exchanges of commodities among 
enterprises in different regions for promoting the establishment 
of a unified market, but also conducive to implementing state 
guidance and regulation in market economic development. This is 
to reflect and bring into play the role of the market mechanism 
and to strengthen the unanimity of macroeconomic regulation and 
control. 
  Second, it is possible to ensure fair competition among 
enterprises only with a fair tax-sharing system. The precise 
reason for the efficiency of market economy is competition. 
Enterprises are independent producers and merchandisers of 
commodities, and a vital condition for their survival and 
development also lies in competition. However, competition must 
be fair. Whether or not a fair tax-sharing system can be 
implemented bears decisive significance to ensuring fair 
competition. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the 
principle of fair tax-sharing for all different types of 
enterprises for promoting fair competition. 
  Third, it is possible to optimize the taxation system only 
with a simplified taxation system. In the current taxation 
system, there is an excessive number of interim tax categories; 
an exclusion of a small number of essential tax categories; a 
loose taxation system structure; and an irrational distribution 
of tax categories, thus affecting the overall efficiency of the 
taxation system. The purpose of simplifying the taxation system 
is to further rationalize the system structure to make it more 
efficient. 
  Fourth, it is possible to better handle the distribution 
between the central authorities and localities only with the 
rational distribution of powers. Our country is a vast 
territory and economic development in different regions is 
rather unbalanced. Therefore, it is essential to suitably change 
the situation of the past where the powers in taxation matters 
were overconcentrated in the hands of the central authorities, 
when it actually could not handle -- or efficiently handle -- 
tax matters. Under the prerequisite of unifying the taxation 
law, tax categories that concern the implementation of state 
policy on macroeconomic control and regulation should come under 
the control of the central authorities. Tax collection powers 
that concern the regulation of industrial production structure 
should be undertaken by the central authorities. The authority 
for formulating procedures for tax collection and management 
favorable to local governments' regulation of local economy and 
income, and even the power to enact a few local tax laws, should 
all be given to localities. 
  There is an inherent unity in unified taxation law, fair 
tax-sharing, simplified taxation system, and rational power 
distribution. The core function is to suit the changes in 
national income distribution, standardize the distribution 
methods, and regulate distribution so as to form a rational 
distribution mechanism for promoting a healthy development for 
the socialist market economy.

  [Text] (Footnote) (This article is an extract from the book 
An Analysis and Forecast of China's Economic Situation in 
1994 which will soon be published by the Publishing House 
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences) 
  Under the guidance of important talks by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping during his inspection tour to southern China and the 
spirit of 14th Congress of the CPC, China is making rapid 
progress along the road of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and the national economy maintains a fine 
momentum of vigorous development. Following a high-speed growth 
of 13.2 percent in 1992, the economy continued to grow at a 
super high-speed of 14.1 percent in the first half of 1993. 
  On this basis, whether or not China can truly take a big 
step 
forward in 1994 in building a socialist market economy and in 
restructuring while maintaining a particular rate of economic 
growth and effectively curbing inflation will be a key to 
whether or not China's economic development can enter a new 
stage in the 1990's.

<H5>  II. Overall Analysis of Economic Development Trend in 1993 </H5>
  In the first half of 1993, China's economic growth rate 
was the highest in recent years. The GDP increased by 14.1 
percent, and total industrial output value increased by 25.1 
percent. Moreover, there was excessive expansion of investment 
scale, and the growth rate of fixed assets investments of the 
whole society reached as high as 61 percent, of which the growth 
rate of investments by state-owned organizations reached 70.7 
percent, deducting price factors, the actual growth is over 30 
percent, far exceeding the actual growth rate of the GDP. The 
investment structure is still not sufficiently rational. First, 
besides an increase in the proportion of investments in 
communications and transportation, the proportion of investments 
in energy, raw and processed materials, agriculture, and other 
basic industries all are in decline. 
  Take state-owned organizations, for example. The total 
volume of investments in the first half of 1993 increased by 
63.6 percent compared with the corresponding period of 1992, but 
the investments in energy, raw and processed materials, and 
agriculture grew by 18.1 percent, 51.9 percent, and 28.6 percent 
respectively. Second, the proportion of nonproductive 
investments was too high, the growth rate of productive 
investments by state-owned organizations in the first half of 
1993 was 58.6 percent, and that of nonproductive investments was 
up at 83.1 percent. In particular, the investments in real 
estate grew too rapidly, and commodity housing investments by 
state-owned organizations grew by 144 percent. Such a "double 
high" problem and excessive increase in monetary issue that 
appeared simultaneously led to a speed-up of inflation. In the 
first half of 1993, the commodity retail price index of the 
whole society rose by 10.8 percent, and the price index of the 
cost of living for city and town residents rose by 13.5 percent, 
of which that of 35 large- and medium-sized cities rose by 17.4 
percent. 
  The CPC and the government have taken necessary measures, 
and 
starting from controlling the investment scale and strengthening 
the financial order, have stepped up macroeconomic regulation 
and control, and initial success has been achieved. By the end 
of September, the average growth rate of total industrial output 
value declined by one percentage point compared with the average 
growth rate of the first half of 1993. The increasing posture 
of fixed assets investments slowed down, the growth rate of 
investments by state-owned organizations from January to 
September dropped by nearly four percentage points compared with 
that of the first half of 1993, and newly operated projects 
reduced markedly. Prices of the means of production turned from 
speedy rise to relaxation, residents' savings rose rapidly, and 
the foreign exchange market was tending toward stability. 
  Taking an extensive look at the year 1993, the general trend 
of economic development is: First, the economic growth for the 
whole year will maintain a high speed, and the GDP growth rate 
will be about 13.5 percent. However, the growth situation in 
the second half of the year will slow down smoothly, and the 
increase value growth rate of primary, secondary, and tertiary 
industries will be about 3.5 percent, 20 percent, and 11 percent 
respectively. As the measures for regulation and control of the 
central authorities have inhibited newly operated projects to a 
certain extent, the growth rate of investments in the second 
half of the year will drop distinctly. But the fixed asset 
investment scale of the whole society for the year will break 
through the 1,100 billion yuan, with a growth rate of over 40 
percent. Second, both income and consumption of the residents 
present a rising situation, the market is flourishing and is 
tending toward stability, and the nominal growth of the total 
volume of social commodities may reach 23 percent, but the 
growth of income and consumption of rural residents will still 
be obviously lower than the average level of all China. Third, 
the economic growth rate and the investment growth rate in the 
second half of 1933 have somewhat reduced, but thanks to impacts 
by the cost push factor and by the excessive scale of monetary 
issue, and due to the steady rise in consumption demand, prices 
still continuously increase, and the rise in various price 
indexes will break through 10 percent. Fourth, the monetary and 
financial situation has started turning for the better, but will 
still be beset with difficulties, and new monetary issue will 
reach a record- breaking level. 
<H3>  III. The Importance of Strengthening Macroregulation and 
Control </H3>
  An important feature in the development of the national 
economy in 1993 is that when the speedily growing economy 
probably entered an "overheated" stage, the CPC and the 
government introduced measures for macroregulation and control. 
These measures will produce the following direct results: 
  1. They will curb further deterioration of monetary 
difficulties and the chaotic situation, prevent excessive 
expansion of the scale of fixed assets investments of the whole 
society, avoid further aggravation of inflation, guarantee basic 
balance between general supply and demand, favorable to 
maintaining mid-term and short-term economic stability and 
mid-term and long-term sustained economic growth. 
  2. They will be favorable to restructuring, to concentrating 
funds to speed up the construction of basic facilities, relaxing 
the constraint of the "bottleneck" sectors of the national 
economy, and laying a foundation for long-term economic 
development. This is obviously different from the readjustment 
in 1988-1989. 
  3. It is an extremely necessary measure and a broad and 
long-term view to start by strengthening the monetary order. 
Strengthening the economic order in every aspect, and building 
up a necessary market order, are important conditions for 
successfully building up the system of a socialist market 
economy. The essence and cause for various problems that have 
cropped up in the present stage of economic growth are not so 
much of an "overheated" economy as "over-chaotic" economy. 
Various over-chaotic orders are the fundamental causes that 
give rise to an "overheated" economy in certain aspects. 
Therefore, not only monetary order should be strengthened, but 
orders in various other aspects, such as fiscal levy order, 
various securities market order, and real estate market order, 
as well as the working order of various levels of administrative 
and management departments, should also be seriously 
strengthened to build up a strict and effective system to be 
rational follow-up actions for strengthening the monetary order. 
These are not only the requirements for developing a market 
economy, but also fundamental measures for maintaining social 
stability and solidarity throughout China. 
  Another important feature of economic development in 1993 is 
that China's economic growth is entering a new stage of 
development. The 14th CPC Congress clearly pointed out that the 
goal of reform was to put into practice the system of a 
socialist market economy. Theory and practice have told us that 
no matter which kind of social system is in place, the market 
cannot automatically reach general equilibrium and optimum 
performance, and intervention or regulation and control by 
external factors is absolutely necessary. Such intervention or 
regulation and control not only refers to day-to-day 
macroeconomic regulation and control, but more important it 
refers to necessary environment and institutional 
establishments. In the first stage of China's reform, in light 
of influences by the traditional planned economy, we should 
emphasize the market economy; in the new stage, we should shift 
the emphasis onto building a market economy. In the present 
strengthening of order, the central authorities not only point 
out the necessity for continued reform, but also put forward the 
initial framework for building a socialist market economy. This 
is fundamentally different from the control over an "overheated" 
economy on previous occasions, and is therefore of important 
significance. 
  On the other hand, we should also pay close attention to 
the problems that may probably be brought out in the course of 
carrying out these measures. 
  First, as the deposit interest rate has increased by a big 
margin, and the policy of savings to retain value has been put 
into practice, the loan interest rate will also be compelled to 
increase by a big margin. This will add to the difficulties of 
funds supply, and increase the pressure on the cost of 
enterprises for fundraising, in particular the pressure on that 
of state-owned enterprises, thus increasing the scope and amount 
of losses. 
  Second, tight money will result in "debt chains". With the 
decline in economic growth rate, intermediate demand will 
greatly decrease, and enterprises with unsatisfactory economic 
operations will meet with the problem of difficult sales in a 
market whose temperature is dropping. It can be foreseen that 
"debt chains" will be a problem that enterprises must encounter 
in 1994. 
  Third, the consumer goods market basically remains in a 
state 
of supply slightly greater than demand. To increase interest 
rates will encourage the tendency of savings, and reduce 
consumption. This will only inhibit future investments, with 
little impact on existing investments. As there has been too 
big a proportion of investments in general processing industries 
in the last two years, the production capacity built up 
therefrom will create new supply within a subsequent period of 
time. Moreover, there have been excessive increases in the 
prices of investment goods in the last two years, which add to 
the cost of future products, and it is extremely difficult to 
eliminate this kind of price rise pushed by cost. This problem 
will create obstacles to the stability and balanced development 
of the economy for a period of time to come. 
  Fourth, the interest rate of long-term deposits at present 
is 
too high, and apart from affecting people's expectations it will 
create problems for banks' long-term operations. First, the 
actual interest rate that the banks are required to pay for 
long-term deposits is too high, which increases banks' 
operational difficulties. Second, in banks' operation of funds, 
the growth rate of loans for fixed assets is much higher than 
that of other loans, and the cost of this type of loan will be 
high, which will create an unfavorable impact on basic 
facilities construction that mainly relies on bank loans for the 
source of funds. 
  Fifth, various measures taken at present are an integration 
of market measures with administrative measures, which basically 
fit in with the actual situation of tracks changing in China's 
present economic structure. However, they are of an "emergency" 
nature, and it is unavoidable for the problem of "one cutting" 
to emerge in the course of implementation. Moreover, it is also 
necessary to avoid difficulties in restructuring resulting from 
the protection of large and influential profit and taxpayers by 
local governments. 
  The fundamental solution to these problems can only rely on 
the thoroughgoing reform of the monetary system and the 
financial and taxation system, and on the establishment and 
improvement in the system of a socialist market economy. 
<H5>  IV. Several Possibilities for a "Soft Landing" in 1994 </H5>
  The measures for macroeconomic regulation and control 
introduced at present have both to solve the problems of an 
"overheated" economy, and to maintain appropriate high-speed 
growth of the national economy, and bear an obvious 
characteristics of "soft landing." A "soft landing" is not only 
difficult in operation and control, but there are also several 
possible results. 
  The first result is: Due to the fact that the strength of 
various measures for regulation and control are properly 
controlled, that various levels of leadership and economic 
management departments are closely coordinated, and that all of 
China is well coordinated and acts in unison, the momentum of an 
overheated economy is brought under control, the inflation rate 
starts declining, and the economic growth rate has dropped to 
about 10 percent. In a relatively tight economic environment, 
there is an increase in the weight of reform in the monetary and 
banking system and the financial and taxation system, and a push 
for state-owned enterprises to move toward the market. The 
investment scale both maintains growth and is kept under 
control, the investment structure is improved, and investments 
in communications, transportation, post, and telecommunications 
continue a high growth rate. Moreover, the proportion of 
investments in agriculture, energy, raw and process materials, 
and other basic industrial sectors increases. The proportion of 
nonproductive investments and that of investments in general 
processing industries decreases, and the overall investment 
scale maintains a growth rate of about 20 percent. On the other 
hand, as the residents' income increases, the consumer demand 
grows steadily, and social general demand maintains a moderate 
degree of growth. Stimulated by demand, industrial production 
maintains a growth rate of about 15 percent, and is within the 
range that the "bottleneck" sectors can support. Economic 
development is smoothly transitioning to a period of high-speed 
and steady growth, and can be sustained for a number of years. 
These are the results which we expect will appear. 
  The key to achieving these results lies in carrying out 
in-depth reform in an overall manner, building up a 
complementary system of a socialist market economy, and ensuring 
an orderly development of the national economy. The emphasis on 
macroeconomic regulation and control should take structure 
readjustment and optimization as the center, and effective 
control of inflation should be an important prerequisite for 
achieving this goal. 
  The second result is: The strength of macroeconomic 
regulation and control is too strong, and excessive contraction 
leads to excessive loss of speed in economic growth, resulting 
in a "hard landing." The investment scale and price rises are 
brought under control, but the emphasis of regulation and 
control is not placed on structure readjustment and 
optimization. Only speed reduction in economic growth is 
enforced to fit in with the "bottlenecks" without paying 
attention to developing the "bottlenecks" sectors. This will 
not only bring about losses in economic development, but will 
also become the starting point of the next round of an 
"overheated" economy. 
  The third result is: As a result of evading the problem of 
restructuring or being satisfied with a smattering of a subject, 
far less taking rectification and chaos control and building up 
the system of a socialist market economy as the final goal of 
the present macroregulation and control, under the pressure of a 
number of problems brought by slowing down the rate of economic 
growth, economic reform stops moving forward, and the deep-level 
contradictions that impede healthy economic development have not 
been overcome. Hurriedly relaxing money and control over 
investment scale and loosening the gate of monetary issue for 
the sake of stimulating economic recovery leads to an early 
rebound of the economic growth rate, thus further deteriorating 
the economic structure. The constraint on communications and 
transportation is further strengthened, the contradiction 
between energy supply and demand becomes tense again, the 
inflation that has just been curbed is revived like dying embers 
glowing again, and the economic order becomes chaotic. The 
expectation of residents has deviated from normal, and even 
provoked factors of social instability, which compels the 
decision-making departments to take "emergency brake" measures 
and carry out large scale readjustment and contraction of the 
economy, thereby resulting in unnecessary losses and seriously 
affecting the development of a socialist market economy. 
<H5>  V. The Characteristics of Economic Development in 1994 </H5>
  As long as no major mistake is made in 1994, the growth of 
the national economy will continue a momentum of smoothly 
slowing down. This will provide favorable conditions for 
strengthening industrial restructuring, and carrying out an 
overall reform with market economy as a guide. In analyzing the 
characteristics of macroeconomic development in 1994, we should 
pay major attention to these three aspects: Growth rate, 
investment scale, and inflation. 
  1. The economic growth rate will drop by a moderate degree, 
but will maintain a high level of growth. The growth rate of 
the national economy in 1994 will be lower than that of the 
previous two years, but it is forecast that it will still stay 
at about 10 percent. There is both necessity and possibility 
for the economic growth rate to drop by a moderate degree while 
a high level of growth is maintained. Its necessity lies in: 
  First, moderate reduction of the growth rate fits in with 
the 
cyclical stage of China's present economic development. 
Moreover, it plays the role of appropriately mitigating the 
constraining contradiction of the "bottleneck" sectors and 
curbing large price increases, and ensures that the work of 
economic restructuring will have a good environmental condition 
to concentrate financial and material resources on vigorously 
developing the construction of basic industries and basic 
facilities. 
  Second, maintaining economic growth at a high level is 
beneficial to avoiding big rise and fall in economic 
development, reducing the shock caused by cyclical fluctuations, 
ensuring the stability of economic development, and maintaining 
a situation of social stability and unity. 
  Third, a moderate reduction in the economic growth rate 
without a serious loss of speed conforms with the requirements 
of long-term, steady, and healthy development, and conforms all 
the more with the requirements of quickening in every aspect the 
pace of building up the system of a socialist market economy. 
Such an economic growth rate fits in with the general 
principles and measures for implementation being formulated by 
the central authorities for building up and developing a 
socialist market economy. 
  In analyzing the possibility of achieving such a growth 
rate, 
we should see both the possible constraining factors and also 
various kinds of motive forces. 
  The constraining factors come mainly from two aspects: The 
"bottleneck" constraint and the system constraint. The 
constraint by the "bottleneck" of communications and 
transportation is known to all, and there have been large 
increases in their investments in the last two years, but time 
is required before these investments truly play their role. 
Excessive demand for raw and processed materials has made the 
increase margin of the prices level of the means of production 
exceed the 1988 level. The symptoms of energy supply shortages 
have appeared, and China's energy export in 1991 was about 40 
million tons, less than the amount of growth of energy 
consumption in 1992. With its high-speed economic growth, China 
will change in one or two years from an energy export country to 
an energy net import country. Only by appropriately reducing 
economic growth rate can the "bottleneck" constraint be 
relatively alleviated. Judging from the supply capacity of the 
"bottleneck" sectors at present, an economic growth of about 10 
percent in 1994 can be basically supported. 
  The system constraint is mainly expressed in the delay in 
monetary and financial reforms and the delay in functional 
transformation of government departments. This will provide an 
opportunity to various factors that cause "over-chaotic" 
economic activities, and lead to an overheated economy. When 
high inflation is brought about by an "overheated" economy, the 
authorities cannot but take emergency braking measures. 
  The motive force that promotes economic growth is mainly 
investment demand and consumption demand. Since the 1990's, 
there have been marked increases in the residents' income level, 
which has reinvigorated the consumer market that has been weak 
for a time and has led to a steady increase in total consumer 
demand. In 1994, the consumption growth rate will come close to 
the GDP growth rate, and the consumer goods market will remain 
prosperous. The growth of consumption is not just an expansion 
in quantity, more importantly it is an improvement in quality. 
Competition in the consumer goods market will become 
increasingly fierce. The growth of consumer demand will create 
favorable conditions for economic growth, in particular for the 
growth of light industrial production and the development of the 
tertiary industry. Moreover, high savings, which are beneficial 
to solving the problem of funds shortage, will also constantly 
bring vitality to economic development. 
  2. The growth situation of investment scale will reduce, 
but to maintain a moderate degree of investment is still 
required, so as to strengthen restructuring. Investment pull is 
the major motive force of super high-speed economic growth that 
started in 1992. In 1994, thanks to subjective and objective 
reasons, the growth rate of fixed assets investments of the 
whole society will decline by a considerable margin, but the 
total amount of investment, it is forecast, will still exceed 
1.35 trillion yuan, and the actual investment growth rate will 
still be higher than the actual growth rate of the GDP by one to 
two percentage points. First of all, to maintain a particular 
scale of fixed assets investments of the whole society is 
necessary for achieving a smooth transition to super high-speed 
operation of the national economy, and it is helpful to 
preventing economic slides and the intensification of 
contradiction between general supply and demand. Second, to 
rationally readjust the economic structure, strengthen the 
construction of basic facilities, and expand the supply capacity 
of the "bottleneck" sectors, it is also necessary to strengthen 
the investments in agriculture, in communications and 
transportation and post and telecommunications industries, the 
energy industry, and the industry of some raw and processed 
materials, so as to solve the problem in the two aspects of 
investment structure and total amount. To cope with the 
"bottleneck" constraint, it is improper to take an attitude of 
"cutting the feet to fit the shoes". We should carry out active 
and positive economic restructuring by following the principle 
of concentrating funds and taking preferential measures for 
developing the "bottleneck" sectors. Not only the strategic 
actions of vigorous development of basic industries will 
contribute to economic growth, but the gradual mitigation of the 
"bottleneck" constraint will also promote an overall and 
high-speed growth of the national economy. Third, due to 
unbalanced development in reform and opening-up, and thanks to 
the differences in the original conditions, there is now an 
ever-greater gap in economic development between the coastal 
areas and the interior and remote areas, which has become a 
problem that requires an immediate solution. To speed up the 
economic development of the interior and remote areas, and to 
reduce regional gaps, it is also necessary to increase 
investments in these areas by in-depth reform. Finally, initial 
success has been achieved in the macroregulation and control 
measures taken by the central authorities in 1993, there have 
been large increases in the residents' savings, and the banking 
and monetary system has concentrated through rectification 
considerable amount of funds that can be made use of, thus 
providing funds conditions for maintaining a certain scale of 
total investment amount in 1994. Maintaining a particular scale 
of fixed assets investments in 1994 will be an important 
propelling force for maintaining a certain economic growth rate 
and speeding up economic restructuring. 
  The measures for regulation and control taken by the central 
authorities in 1993 have been generally well received by 
economic circles overseas, which has not only strengthened the 
confidence of investors overseas for short-term stability of 
China's economy, but has also enabled them to see a bright 
future of long-term, healthy, and high-speed development of 
China's economy, and helped them extend their vision of 
investments from coastal areas to China's hinterland. In 1994 
and in a number of years to come, foreign capital will play an 
ever more important role to maintaining a continuous growth of 
the scale of fixed assets investments in China. 
  The proportion of local investments in the fixed assets 
investments of the whole society rises continuously. In 1992, 
the proportion of local investments in total investments reached 
60 percent. From January to August 1993, in investments in 
state-owned enterprises alone, the proportion of local 
investments rose to 62 percent, with a growth rate of 74.3 
percent. In 1994, local investments will still occupy an 
important proportion, but the tendency of local government 
behavior which runs counter to the policies of the central 
authorities has not always been effectively overcome. In 
economic development and maintaining growth rate, local 
initiatives should be brought into play and relied upon. 
However, one of the formidable enemies in strengthening 
macroregulation and control and maintaining economic stability 
is blindness in local development. To solve this problem, we 
should of course rely on certain administrative means, but the 
key still lies in building up as soon as possible the system of 
a socialist market economy, and standardizing the behavior of 
various levels of government from the angle of system, so as to 
obtain the results of a coordinated, steady, and all-round 
development of China's economy. 
  3. It is difficult to reduce the pressure of inflation, and 
prices will still remain high. Due to influences by the cost 
push factor and excessive monetary issue during the previous 
period, their delay effects and the introduction of a number of 
necessary reform measures have made the control over inflation 
in 1994 become an extremely arduous task, and it will be very 
difficult to keep the price rises below 6 percent. It is 
estimated that the retail price level of the whole society in 
1994 will come close to 10 percent, and the price index of the 
living cost for city and town residents may possibly break 
through 10 percent. 
  In 1992 and 1993 prices of raw and processed materials as 
investment goods rose by a big margin, which resulted in 
increases in the cost of products of the manufacturing industry. 
As the increase margin is too big, it is very difficult for 
enterprises at the present technological level and economic 
strength to digest it completely, and about 50 percent of the 
price increases of the means of production, it is estimated, 
will be shifted to the prices of the consumer goods. The prices 
of investment goods in 1993, it is estimated, will increase by 
18.5 percent, of which about 9 percent will be shifted to the 
prices of the consumer goods in the following year and the years 
afterwards. These are price increases pushed by cost, and can 
in no way be overcome by further reduction of demand. 
  Another important cause of price rises is the large increase 
in the amount of money in circulation. A 30 percent growth is 
estimated for 1993, and it is impossible for it not to produce a 
push on prices in 1993 and 1994. Plus influences by other 
factors, the margin of increase in social retail prices in 1994 
will come close to 10 percent. If certain errors again appear 
in macroregulation and control and management in 1994, it will 
be possible that prices rise will again break through 10 percent. 
<H5>  VI. Policies Proposals </H5>
  Based on the above analysis, successfully achieving "soft 
landing" and maintaining a particular economic growth rate in 
1994 should be the goal of macroeconomic work. Optimizing the 
industrial structure should be the central task of various kinds 
of economic work, and curbing inflation is an important 
prerequisite for achieving the above goal. Quickening the pace 
of reform systematically and in an overall manner and building 
up the system of a socialist market economy are fundamental 
guarantees for a sustained, high-speed, and healthy development 
of China's economy. 
  1. Properly control the strength of macroregulation and 
control. Pay attention to historical experiences and lessons, 
continue implementation and improvement in the regulation and 
control measures taken at present, keep strengthening the 
monetary order, the financial and taxation order, and the order 
of various kinds of market, and do better jobs in 
macroregulation and control. The present "soft landing" work is 
in a state of direct regulation, many problems accumulated 
during the previous period have not been effectively overcome, 
and the difficulty is therefore greater. There are some positive 
factors in the present regulation and control. For example, the 
impact on nonstate-owned enterprises is greater than that on 
state-owned enterprises, the impact on inhibiting local 
investments is greater than that on investments by the central 
authorities, and the impact on group consumption is greater than 
that on the residents' consumption. But we must also see that 
to solve fundamentally the problems in various aspects of 
macroeconomic operation, exceedingly difficult and unremitting 
efforts are still required to solve the problems in structure 
and mechanism. It is necessary to guard against "one cutting," 
and to carry out classified guidance aiming at regions and 
industries, so as to ensure a successful realization of "soft 
landing." At least before the second half of 1994, it is not 
suitable to introduce measures that stimulate excessive 
resumption of economic growth, and earnestly put the stress of 
development on readjusting and optimizing the economic 
structure. This is because: First, the economic growth rate 
will slide in 1994, but a growth of about 10 percent is still 
high-speed, and a growth of over 15 percent of total industrial 
output value is quite spectacular. Even if the economic growth 
rate for 1995 is reduced by a further 2 percent, a growth rate 
of 8 percent is not low. Second, the pressure of inflation in 
1994 will be enormous. There were excessive monetary issues in 
1992 and 1993, and considering the cost push and other factors, 
even if tight money will continue in 1994, the price rises will 
also come close to 10 percent, and stimulation of economic 
recovery will only aggravate inflation. Third, the tense 
situation of communications and transportation where problems 
are most concentrated in the current cycle will not be relaxed 
before 1995. It is impossible for the energy shortage problem, 
the shortage of oil and electricity in particular, to ease up in 
1994, and even if there are large increases in energy 
investment, it is difficult to see the results in one or two 
years. The stress of macroeconomic policies in 1994 should be 
placed on speeding up reform and restructuring. If we do a good 
job in economic restructuring in 1994, and earnestly increase 
the strength of investments in basic industrial sectors, 
appropriately control the investments in other sectors, then we 
can first ensure a moderate degree of growth of investment 
demand (it is suitable to keep the margin of investment at 20 to 
25 percent), and achieve "soft landing." Second, we can 
increase the supply of the "bottleneck" sectors, and lay a 
foundation for the next economic recovery, and even for a 
long-term and high-speed growth of the national economy. 
  2. Readjust and optimize the industrial structure, and lay 
emphasis on strengthening the investments in agriculture, the 
communications and transportation and post and telecommunication 
industries, the energy industry, and the industry of some kinds 
of raw and processed materials. It is necessary to improve the 
investment performance by investment structural reform to better 
solve the "bottleneck" constraint problem. At present, it is 
necessary to solve well problems in five aspects: First, the 
development of the "bottleneck" sectors mainly relies on the 
increment readjustment of increasing the supply capacity by 
investments, it is therefore necessary to enlarge the quantity 
of state investments (including those by the central and local 
authorities). This makes it necessary to increase the state 
revenue and increase the proportion of revenue in the national 
income by financial and taxation structural reform. In 
expenditure, it is necessary to enlarge the proportion of 
investments in basic facilities, so as to ensure the source of 
funds. Second, it is necessary to reform the investment 
structure, carry out the joint stock system and various other 
forms of funds raising and financing by long-term loans and 
issue of construction bonds, and fully draw and guide social 
funds and foreign capital to make investments in basic 
facilities construction. Third, the state is required to work 
out and carry out rational industrial policies, and promote a 
speedy development of basic industries and basic facilities 
construction. Fourth, it is necessary to further reform the 
pricing structure, follow the principle of the market economy, 
mobilize the initiatives of investments and operations by 
economic benefits, and speed up the pricing reform of 
communications and transportation and energy within the scope 
allowed by the inflation rate. Fifth, it is necessary to 
actively introduce market competition mechanism in industries of 
communications and transportation and post telecommunication 
which are highly monopolistic. To break industrial monopoly in 
unnatural monopolistic sectors is the most effective method for 
developing these sectors. 
  3. Strictly control inflation. The goal for controlling 
inflation in 1994 should be: Relax the intensity released by 
the pressure of inflation and strive to lower the rate of price 
increases in 1955 and the years afterwards. In 1994 we should 
strive to control the price increase rate at about 8 percent 
without breaking 10 percent, and actively create conditions to 
try to keep the rate of price rises in 1995 at about 6 percent. 
So long as there is no further expansion of investments in the 
recent period, and appropriately control the growth rate of 
money in circulation, it is possible to achieve this goal. This 
makes it necessary to speed up the monetary and financial 
structural reform, make proper arrangements in monetary and 
financial planning, control basic currency growth rate, the 
amount of monetary issue in particular, and control the credit 
scale strictly in accordance with the need of a moderate and 
high-speed economic growth. According to forecast simulation, 
new monetary issue in 1994 should be controlled within 100 
billion yuan, and new credit scale should be limited to 550 
billion yuan. However, one of the causes for the excessive 
increase in the price index of the residents' living cost is too 
rapid increase in the prices of daily necessities and services 
which have relatively small income elasticity. In this respect, 
the guiding control and mandatory control on the part of the 
state should play a role to inhibit influences by artificial 
factors. 
  4. Quicken the pace of building up the system of a socialist 
market economy, make preparations for various reforms, and make 
1994 a year of major reform. Beginning from now, we should make 
preparations. First, study the opportune moment and measures 
for reform, and the balanced and overall developments of various 
aspects to ensure an orderly progress of reform. Second, make 
necessary public opinion preparations to ensure that the 
psychological expectation of the resident are normal. Third, 
study the bearing capacity of various aspects about the measures 
of reform, so as to keep a rational quantity limit and the scope 
of strength under control. Fourth, study the problems and 
deviations that may possibly crop up in the course of 
implementation, work out preventive measures aiming at specific 
goals, speed up the building of economic legal system, and 
ensure the successful progress of reform. Speed up the pace of 
reform systematically and in an overall manner, beginning first 
from the reform of the monetary and financial systems, followed 
by various other complementary reforms. This will enable China's 
reform to enter a new stage. It not only can ensure a stable 
development of the national economy in the next one or two 
years, but will also open up a vast world for high-speed 
development of China's economy in this century and over a long 
period of time to come.

<F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] To cope with the situation regarding the 
serious outbreak of diseases caused by iodine deficiency in 
China, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the 
China Light Industry Federation, the Ministry of Internal Trade, 
the Ministry of Public Health, and the State Administration for 
Technological Supervision held a joint news conference today at 
which they called on all localities to strengthen control over 
the table salt markets by preventing non-iodized salt from 
entering iodine-deficient areas so as to protect the health of 
the people. [passage omitted] 
  In recent years, some areas have engaged in the reckless 
production of nonedible salt which has been marketed in large 
quantifies by some units and individuals in violation of the 
relevant state regulations. In particular, large quantities of 
noniodized salt have been sold in iodine-deficient areas, thus 
causing a drastic rise in the number of iodine-deficiency 
diseases. 
  The party Central Committee and the State Council are paying 
close attention to the situation regarding the table salt 
market. Vice Premier Li Lanqing and State Councillor Peng Peiyun 
have called on the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce to adopt measures in coordination with other relevant 
departments to strengthen control over the salt markets. 
  The State Administration for Industry and Commerce and four 
other departments today issued a joint circular on strengthening 
the administration of the state's salt markets and strictly 
banning the sales of non-iodized salt to iodine-deficient areas. 
The circular said: The state will introduce a system whereby 
permits are required for the production of table salt and 
wholesale transaction of salt products; there will be a 
crackdown on illegal production and sales of salt products; and 
enterprises currently engaged in the production and wholesale of 
table salt must renew their registrations by 30 April 1994.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Leader Calls For Increase in Grain, </F>
Cotton Acreages"] 
  [Text] China should increase its acreages of grain and 
cotton by every possible means to guarantee adequate output, a 
top Chinese official said over the weekend in Beijing. 
  The decrease in recent years in the acreage of such 
important 
crops as grain, cotton and vegetables must be reversed, said 
State Councillor Chen Junsheng. 
  Chen, who is in charge of China's agricultural and rural 
affairs, was speaking to more than 300 agricultural officials 
attending a national conference on agriculture that ended on 
Saturday. 
  He said it is of strategic importance to national stability 
and the smooth implementation of a series of crucial reform 
measures this year to ensure adequate supply of farm produce. 
  China has decided to plant at least 110 million hectares of 
grain and 6 million hectares of cotton this year to reach its 
1994 target of 450 million tons of grain and 4.85 million tons 
of cotton. 
  Even though the acreage of grain planted last year declined 
by about 666,700 hectares from 1992, China managed to reap 
another bumper harvest with a slight increase over the 442.6 
million tons of grain harvested in 1992. 
  In 1992, about 1.86 million hectares of grain fields were 
used to plant cash crops or for non-farming purposes. 
  Chen criticized the rush to enclose and occupy large 
sections 
of farmland, including vegetable fields in suburbs, for 
development of real estate markets, industrial projects and 
other purposes. 
  "Stimulated by quick profits, many areas, especially those 
in 
coastal regions, have abandoned agricultural production," he 
added. 
  Some former grain-exporting provinces have become 
grain-importing ones, Chen noted. 
  And output in former grain-importing provinces, including 
Guangdong, has declined further. 
  Guangdong, with the country's most vibrant economy, has seen 
its farmland reduced by some 310,000 hectares since 1991. Its 
grain yield was 16.3 million tons last year, down 1.796 million 
tons, or 9.9 percent, from that in 1992. Its 1992 grain output 
was 3.4 per cent less than in 1991. 
  According to the Ministry of Agriculture, most of the 
provinces in South China have experienced a decrease in output 
of grain and cotton. 
  Chen laid the blame on less profitable farming, which has 
forced more and more farmers to leave farmland uncultivated, and 
the issuing of IOU notes --failing to pay farmers in cash when 
purchasing farm produce -- and increasing financial and labour 
burdens on farmers.

  [Text] Beijing, January 11 (XINHUA) -- China will gradually 
increase its investment in large-scale agricultural development 
projects, which reached two billion yuan last year. 
  Speaking at a national meeting on comprehensive agricultural 
development, State Councillor Chen Junsheng said China will 
continue to increase the output of grain, cotton and other farm 
produce and more investment will be used for their development. 
  Chen, who is in charge of China's agriculture, said that 
priority will be given to production of grain, cotton, edible 
oil and meat, transformation of grassland and development of 
large areas of wasteland. 
  People in the central and western parts of China, which 
accounted for about 60 percent of the total investment during 
the five years, will be given more money for comprehensive 
agricultural development, he added. 
  He said that nearly 20 billion yuan investment in 
comprehensive agricultural projects during 1988-1992 had helped 
China produce more grain, cotton, edible oil, sugar and meat. 
  The official said that a total of about seven million ha 
[hectares] of low-yield and medium-yield farmland had been 
transformed during the five years and about one million ha of 
wasteland suitable for farming have been developed. 
  In addition, about one million ha of land have been 
afforested and 300,000 ha of grassland improved. 
  Thanks to the development, China has produced an additional 
17 million tons of grain, 250,000 tons of cotton, 700,000 tons 
of edible oil, nearly 10,000 tons of sugar and 620,000 tons of 
meat. 
  Priority of the project has been given to five provinces in 
the valleys of the Yellow River, Huaihe River and Haihe River, 
including the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Henan, 
Jiangsu, plains in northwest China and some areas in south and 
central China. 
  "There are about 66 million ha of low-yield and medium-yield 
farmland to be transformed," the official said. He added that 
the land already transformed made up only one tenth of the total. 
  He said the productivity of 80 percent of China's 400 
million 
ha of grassland will be doubled if it is transformed. 
  Grain produced by transformed farmland in east China's Anhui 
Province accounted for about 60 percent of Anhui's total and in 
coastal Shandong Province and north China's Hebei Province, 33 
percent of their grain came from transformed land. 
  Liaoning Province, which is known as a large industrial 
province in China and had to buy 1.5 million tons of grain from 
other parts of the country, has since 1991 become self-efficient 
in grain, eggs, milk, meat and some other farm produce, after a 
five-year-long comprehensive agricultural development.

<F P=106> [By reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Zhao Lianqing </F>
(6392 6647 1987)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- During a recent 
interview with XINHUA reporters, Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang 
said: In 1994 the agricultural sector will deepen reform in an 
effort to achieve the following four targets in developing the 
rural economy: the stable growth of grain, cotton, and 
oil-bearing crops; the sustained growth of vegetable products; 
the fairly rapid improvement of efficiency in village and town 
enterprises; and the sizable increase of farmers' per capita net 
income. 
  Liu Jiang said: In 1993, which is about to end soon, China's 
agriculture and rural economy have maintained their steady 
development: there has been an overall increase in the output of 
grain, meat, eggs, milk, and aquatic products; village and town 
enterprises have been developing in a sustained, speedy, and 
efficient manner; and farmers' per capita net income has 
increased to a certain extent. He said that the all-round 
development of agriculture and the rural economy has played a 
positive role in ensuring the smooth progress of reform and 
opening to the outside world as well as ensuring the sustained 
growth of the national economy. 
  Liu Jiang pointed out: The new situation regarding the 
reform and development of the national economy in 1994 requires 
that agriculture plays a greater role. Therefore, while 
focusing on the goal of stabilizing the supply of farm products 
and increasing farmers' income, the agricultural sector should 
strive to do the following three tasks well: 
  First, it is necessary to stabilize the development of the 
output of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. On the 
prerequisite of basically stabilizing the sown acreage of grain, 
it is necessary to boost per unit area yield by relying on 
science and technology, continue optimizing the product mix, and 
improve the quality of grain; at the same time, every means 
should be taken to reverse the situation regarding the decline 
of cotton output in the past two years by restoring the planting 
acreage, ensuring rational geographical distribution, improving 
methods of controlling plant diseases and insect pests, in order 
to raise total grain output to the level of a normal year. 
  Second, it is necessary to raise the "shopping basket 
program" to a new level by vigorously developing animal 
husbandry, aquatic production, and vegetable production so as to 
supply more and better nonstaple food to the urban and rural 
population. 
  Third, it is necessary to focus on economic results in 
developing village and town enterprises. 
  Liu Jiang said: To meet the need of establishing and 
developing a socialist market economy in rural areas, the 
Ministry of Agriculture has decided to vigorously strengthen the 
construction of an information network to store information 
about policies, laws, and regulations about capital construction 
projects, science and technology, and qualified professionals. 
Through this network and the storing of information about the 
four aspects, the Ministry of Agriculture will be in a better 
position to exercise overall control over the country's 
agriculture.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "Late Talks in Bid to Halt </F>
Textiles War"] 
  [Text] China and the United States are to hold a new round 
of talks in Beijing on Saturday [15 January] in a bid to avert a 
major trade war. 
  The talks have been scheduled before the U.S. acts on its 
decision to slash import, quotas of Chinese textiles and clothes 
"by 25-35 percent" from next Monday. 
  The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Co-operation (Moftec) revealed yesterday that this fourth round 
of talks on the Sino-U.S. textile trade agreement would end the 
same day. 
  But officials refused to comment on the talks in advance. 
  Analysts also declined to predict the outcome of the 
last-ditch effort. 
  However, if the bid failed, they said the U.S. would reduce 
some $1.2 billion worth of textile imports from China, which had 
threatened to retaliate. 
  "It's not clear whether the two sides will make any 
compromise to avert a more bruising trade conflict," one 
observer said. 
  China on Monday urged the U.S. to reconsider its decision 
and 
to negotiate a solution. 
  It charged the U.S. with treading on the spirit of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and the 
Multi-Fibre (international textiles) Arrangement [name of accord 
as published] by unilaterally reducing Chinese imports last week.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Li Xiaozhun (2621 1321 6150)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 9 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The 
recent decision by the United States to unilaterally cut 
mainland China's textile quotas has aroused the great concern of 
manufacturers from three sides across the Taiwan Strait. If the 
decision goes into effect officially, it will: Cause a loss of 
$1.2 billion to the mainland's textile exports; affect Hong 
Kong, which plays an entrepot role for the mainland's trade; and 
will affect Taiwan businessmen who have invested in the 
mainland. It will also affect Taiwan's textile exports. 
  As the mainland's traditional major export commodity, 
textiles occupy a decisive position in overall foreign trade. 
Thanks to the vigorous development of mainland China's economy, 
its textile exports to the U.S. market rank first among other 
textile exporters. According to statistics, the volume of 
mainland China's textile and garment exports to the United 
States totaled $4.7 billion in 1993, an increase of more than 
100 percent over the $2.2 billion in 1988. 
  The U.S. market absorbs a large amount of Chinese textiles, 
showing that there is indeed such a demand. Over the past nine 
months, however, the United States has failed to reach agreement 
with China after four rounds of talks. Eventually, the United 
States decided to unilaterally cut mainland China's textile 
export quotas by 25 to 25 percent [numbers as received] 
commencing 1994, under the excuse of China's "illegal textile 
shipments." The textile quota cut involves an export volume of 
$1.18 billion. If the decision goes into effect on 17 January, 
it will not only incur serious losses in mainland China's 
textile exports but will also adversely affect China's overall 
foreign trade and economic development in 1994. 
  Meanwhile, the U.S. decision to unilaterally cut China's 
export textile quotas will also affect Hong Kong and bring 
losses to its entrepot trade. According to statistics, the 
volume of China's export commodities via Hong Kong totals $50 
billion annually and textiles account for a large proportion of 
this total. Although the textile cut will not immediately 
affect Hong Kong, it will bring losses to China's textile and 
garment exports to the United States via Hong Kong. At the same 
time, it will dampen the enthusiasm of Hong Kong manufacturers 
for investing in the mainland. 
  Two possible conflicts of interests may occur in Taiwan. 
Although the textile export quotas obtained locally by Taiwan 
investors in the mainland are limited, they will also be 
indirectly affected because of the sharp cut in textile quotas. 
On the other hand, Taiwan manufacturers based on the island may 
benefit from the move. According to analyses from Taiwan, 
following the cut in mainland China's quotas, the United States 
will have to get more sources from other regions. As a result, 
Taiwan manufacturers will get some unexpected orders for their 
textile production and this will benefit Taiwan's industry.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiu Qi: "Council Blasts U.S. Action on </F>
Textiles"] 
  [Text] China National Textile Council has blasted the 
United States for its unilateral slashing of China's textile 
import quotas. 
  "The U.S. announcement of its intention to slash China's 
textile export quotas by 25-35 percent is an attack on China's 
textile industry," a spokesman from the China National Textile 
Council said. 
  Hundreds of Chinese enterprises that provide textile 
products 
for the U.S. market will be hurt by the move, the spokesman said. 
  Some producers may even go bankrupt, which could result in 
as 
many as 300,000 job losses in the industry, he added. 
  The council said the U.S. decision was irresponsible and 
unreasonable. 
  The U.S. action also breached the Multi-Fibre Arrangement as 
well as other multilateral trade relationships, he said. 
  China National Textile Council pointed out that the U.S. 
reduction of import quotas will not solve the problem of illegal 
transshipment. 
  "The U.S. decision hurts legal Chinese textile enterprises, 
which is unfair, " said the spokesman. 
  He added the industry had already intensified its crackdown 
on illegal transshipment. 
  The council also called for a negotiated settlement of the 
issue of illegal transshipments. 
  The spokesman said the council hoped to set up an effective 
system in co-operation with the U.S. to deal with the illegal 
transshipment of China's textile products by overseas dealers. 
  At the same time, the China National Textile Council will 
continue to fight the illegal activities with the support of 
Chinese Government.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Wen: "Guangdong Companies To Reel </F>
From Quota Cut"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou--A large number of Chinese companies 
will be hurt by the "irresponsible" decision by the United 
States to slash textile import quotas from China, according to a 
leading textile maker in Guangdong. 
  Wang Shenghuai, Vice-President of Guangdong Textile Import 
and Export Corporation, said he hopes China and the U.S. will 
find a satisfying solution to this sensitive issue during the 
coming fourth round of talks on textile quotas scheduled from 
January 15 to 17. 
  "If a solution can't be reached, we are planning to 
retaliate 
in order to make up our losses," he said. 
  The U.S. announced last week its intention to cut quotas for 
China s textile imports by 25-35 percent in response to illicit 
transshipments of Chinese textiles bearing labels of other 
countries. 
  The reduction would slash Chinese textile exports to the 
U.S. 
by almost $1.2 billion. 
  Wang s company, a leading textile exporter to the U.S., is 
under great pressure if the cuts take effect on January 17. 
  More than 20 percent of the company's exports are shipped to 
the U.S. The company has been doing textile business with U.S. 
companies for 16 years. 
  For the past years, exports to the U.S. have been stable, 
with an annual average of $90 million, Wang said. 
  Under the 25-35 percent cuts quoted by the American side, 
the 
company would lose 70 million yuan ($8 million) in profits this 
year. 
  A recent study conducted on five of his factories that send 
the bulk of their products to the U.S. market showed more than 
6,000 workers might be laid off. 
  Businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan, especially those who 
have opened textile plants in the mainland, are now hesitating 
about doing further business in the area. 
  "They are afraid of going bankrupt if the contracted goods 
are among the still-unannounced 88 types of products that are 
having their quotas reduced by the U.S.," said Wang. 
  "The U.S. should have joined hands with the Chinese side to 
clamp down on illegal textile activities, rather than hurting 
innocent people," Wang said. 
  "The Chinese Government has been tough and cracked down on 
illegal textile traders," he said. 
  Two inspection teams from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Co-operation (Moftec) visited Wang's company last year, 
even though it has not been involved in any illegal trade. 
  "It is unfair to cut our quotas," said Wang. 
  On the other hand, Wang added: "China should learn from this 
not to rely on one country in its future world trade.

  [Text] Washington, January 11 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton is to name a group of civilian scientists to review 
documents on radiation tests on human beings during the Cold 
War, administration officials said today. 
  The panel, which consists of health physicists, radiology 
experts and medical ethics specialists, will review the data 
turned up by inter-agency investigations to comb the hundreds of 
thousands of documents about the tests and see whether ethical 
standards were violated. 
  The efforts, initiated by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, 
also involve the Defense Department, the Department for Veteran 
Affairs and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA). 
  The White House, which set up a "working group" a week ago 
to 
coordinate the activities, said the Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA), is also joining the probe. The CIA reportedly destroyed 
many of the reports on the tests. 
  The Energy Department has so far interviewed some 4,000 
callers on a telephone hotline, about 20 percent of them claimed 
to be victims of some of the radiation experiments, a department 
spokesman said.

  [Text] Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial 
party committee, delivered a speech at the provincial work 
conference on politics and laws on 8 January, at which he 
stated: Major tasks for 1994 are to earnestly implement the 
spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, the spirit of the national work conference on 
politics and laws, and the spirit of the second plenum of the 
sixth provincial party committee. In line with the strategic 
principle of building the two civilizations simultaneously and 
scoring achievements in both of them and according to the 
demands of establishing the system of a socialist marked 
economy, efforts should be made to enhance the function of the 
people's democratic dictatorship and to make all-out efforts to 
safeguard the political stability and social peace so as to 
ensure smooth progress in reform, opening up, and economic 
construction and to create a good social environment for 
fulfilling the task of improving the province's economy to a new 
level and for accelerating the pace of building Jilin into a 
developed, border, and maritime province. Under the leadership 
of the provincial party committee and the provincial people's 
government and by bringing their functional role into full play 
since the beginning of 1993, the organs in charge of politics 
and laws at all levels across the province have further enhanced 
and improved the work of politics and laws; defined the guiding 
ideology of giving priority to stability; safeguarded the 
political stability of the province as a whole; and maintained 
good public security order by upholding the principle of dealing 
strict blows at crime. They have upheld the principle of having 
personnel who are in charge of the work be responsible for the 
work and promoted the implementation of various measures adopted 
for the comprehensive management of public security. They have 
also concentrated their efforts on investigating and handling 
appalling and major criminal cases; played an active role in 
scoring periodical results in the struggle against corruption; 
rendered effective services for applying legal measures to 
establishing the systems of socialist market economy; and made 
positive contributions to ensuring the smooth progress in 
reform, opening up, and economic construction and to building 
Jilin into a developed, border, and maritime province. 
  Wang Jinshan contended: The province's current situation in 
economic development, political stability, nationalities' unity, 
and social progress, is good. However, we should note that our 
province still has many prominent problems affecting the 
political stability and social peace. The hostile forces both 
at home and abroad are colluding each other and echoing each 
other at a distance. Their infiltrating and damaging activities 
have become increasingly intensified. The serious criminal 
cases of various categories steadily increase and unstable 
factors in the society show a relative increase. Under such a 
situation, the task of safeguarding the stability will become 
more heavy and urgent. He urged party committees and 
governments at all levels and departments in charge of politics 
and laws to correctly estimate and judge the situation, to 
resolutely keep a sober head, and to fully discern the important 
position and role of political and legal work. 
  These party committees, governments, and departments in 
charge of political and legal work should be prepared for danger 
in times of peace; take precautions; and conduct the work of 
safeguarding the political stability and social peace 
satisfactorily, profoundly, carefully, and realistically. 
  Wang Jinshan pointed out: Safeguarding the political 
stability represents the major duty of departments in charge of 
political and legal work. They should enhance their struggle 
against hidden dangers and resolutely deal blows at the 
infiltrating and damaging activities launched by the hostile 
forces both at home and abroad. They should also correctly deal 
with the contradictions cropping up under the new situation 
among the people, enhance the capability of handling unexpected 
incidents, realistically and effectively carry out the struggle 
against corruption, and apply the actual deeds and achievements 
scored in the struggle against corruption to winning the 
people's confidence and bringing into play the enthusiasm of the 
vast number of people in safeguarding the stability of the whole 
situation and in engaging in reform and construction. 
  In citing the comprehensive management of public security 
Wang Jinshan said: We should have every locality, department, 
and unit truly implement the responsibility system in conducting 
their comprehensive management of public security. As for those 
that fail to earnestly enforce the leadership responsibility 
system in this regard and have caused a chaotic social order, we 
should exercise the right of vetoing all work done by them and 
impose the disciplinary sanction of the party and administration 
on them. Efforts should be made to further upgrade the work 
level of dealing strict blows at crime and to deal strict blows 
at serious criminal activities by emphasizing the task of 
cracking down on appalling cases, smashing criminal rings, and 
pursuing and capturing escaped criminals. We should resolutely 
eliminate and mop up evil phenomena in the society and block the 
trend of the spread and development of crime. Efforts should 
be made to consolidate the public security order in complicated 
public places, such as railway and bus stations, ports, cultural 
and recreation centers, and trade fairs; to deal with the 
prominent public security problems in rural areas; and to 
restore rural production and livelihood to a normal order. By 
conducting consolidation in a specific field in the struggle of 
dealing strict blows at crime, we should further promote the 
implementation of other measures for the comprehensive 
management of public security to ensure social stability. 
  In citing the task of vigorously rendering effective 
services 
for developing the socialist market economy Wang Jinshan pointed 
out: It is imperative to enhance the building of socialist legal 
systems and to make sure laws are enacted that can be depended 
on, every law must be observed and be strictly enforced; and law 
violations must be handled. Efforts should be made to gradually 
establish complete legal systems suitable to the socialist 
market economy and to fully apply the legal weapon to dealing 
strict blows at the criminal activities that are damaging the 
development of productive forces and the market economy. 
  According to the practical situation in the personnel's 
contingent on the political and legal front, Wang Jinshan 
demanded: In building the contingent of political and legal 
personnel this year, we should continuously implement the 
principle of conducting strict management and enhance the 
education and management over the contingent of political and 
legal personnel by regarding the reform as a motive force and 
the campaign of opposing corruption and encouraging 
administrative honesty as an emphasis so as to stabilize and 
develop the achievements scored in the concentrated 
consolidation, to further upgrade the contingent's quality as a 
whole and fighting strength, and to provide reliable guarantees 
for fulfilling the annual plan for the political and legal work 
this year. 
  Wang Jinshan stressed in his speech: The more we deepen the 
reform, broaden the opening up, develop the market economy, the 
more we should enhance and improve the party's leadership over 
the economic work. At present, special efforts should be made 
to enhance the leadership over politics and ideology and over 
principles and policies and to strengthen the organizational 
leadership. Party committees at all levels should consciously 
put the political and legal work on their important schedule, 
fulfill their duties in dealing with the practical difficulties 
cropping up in the political and legal work, and make new 
contributions to building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
and developing the socialist market economy. 
  Attending the provincial work conference on politics and 
laws 
held in Changchun on 8 January were Ke Muyun, vice chairman of 
the provincial people's congress standing committee and vice 
chairman of the provincial [words indistinct] commission; Wang 
Guofa, vice governor of the province and deputy secretary of the 
provincial commission on politics and laws; and comrades in 
charge of political and legal work from various cities, 
prefectures, and autonomous prefecture.

some delegates to the provincial public security, procuratorial, 
and judicial work conference at Nanhu Guesthouse. He stressed: 
While firmly grasping the central task of economic 
construction, party comittees and governments at all levels 
should also conscientiously carry out public security, 
procuratorial, and judicial work during the new period; 
strengthen investigations and studies; analyze all kinds of 
destabilizing factors; adopt effective measures; try by all 
possible means to maintain political and social stability; and 
guarantee the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and the

security, procuratorial, and judicial work, responsible comrades 
of various city and autonomous prefectural commissions on 
politics and law, and responsible comrades of commissions and 
departments on politics and law of provincial-level organs and

procuratorial and judicial work of their own localities. 
  After conscientiously listening to their speeches, Comrade 
He 
Zhukang gave an important speech. In referring to the issue of 
maintaining political and social stability, He Zhukang pointed 
out: It is necessary to strengthen struggle on the covered 
front, resolutely deal blows to the infiltration and sabotage 
activities launched by hostile elements inside and outside the 
territory, correctly handle the internal contradictions of the 
people under the new situation, raise ability to deal with 
accidental cases, further enhance the level of dealing strict 
blows to criminals, resolutely straighten out the problems on 
dealing ineffective blows, deal strict blows to serious criminal 
offenses and economic criminal activities, persist in banning 
and mopping up socially repulsive phenomena, check its 
developing trend, strengthen security and defense work, give 
priority to managing important areas, form a strict defense 
network, and guarantee social security. 
  In referring to further strengthening the building of public 
security, procuratorial and judicial contingents in his speech, 
He Zhukang called for continuously implementing the principle of 
managing the police strictly, take reform as a motivation and 
the practice of fighting corruption and promoting honesty as the 
priorities, strengthen the management and education of public 
security, procuratorial and judicial contingents, consolidate 
and develop the achievements in conducting concentrated 
consolidation, further enhance the overall quality and fighting 
capacity of the public security ranks and provide a reliable 
organizational guarantee for comprehensively fulfilling the 
public security, procuratorial and judicial work under the new 
period. On realistically strengthening and improving the 
party's leadership over public security, procuratorial, and 
judicial work, He Zhukang stressed: The more we deepen reform, 
expand opening up and develop the market economy, the more we 
should strengthen and improve the party's leadership over public 
security, procuratorial and judicial work. We must be good at 
strengthening leadership over political and ideological work, 
principles and policies and organizations, properly handle the 
relationship between the leadership of the provincial party 
committee and professional guidance given by higher-level 
pertinent departments and between managing things in line with 
law and strengthening the party's leadership. Party committees 
at all levels should fully understand the important status and 
role of public security, procuratorial, and judicial work; 
consciously place this work high on the agenda; strengthen the 
building of leading bodies of public security, procuratorial, 
and judicial departments; and rely on good leading bodies to 
build good contingents. Party committees and governments at all 
levels should help public security, procuratorial, and judicial 
departments solve some practical difficulties, including 
installation of telecommunication equipment and working funds in 
order to guarantee that public security, procuratorial, and 
judicial departments can give full play to their functional role. 
  Feng Ximing, Wang Yunkun, Liu Yazhi, Xu Zhongtian, Ke Muyun, 
and Quan Zhezhu, and other provincial leading comrades attended

<F P=106> [Commentary: "The Key Lies in Actually Protecting Peasants' </F>
Interests"] 
  [Text] Agriculture has already aroused universal concern 
in the whole province. The just closed provincial rural work 
conference has defined the objectives and principles for the 
rural work in the next year and adopted measures to 
energetically develop agriculture. Then, what is the major 
problem of agriculture? Although there are a multitude of 
problems in agriculture, the core of them at present can be 
summarized as that peasants' enthusiasm in production has been 
dampened and thus has declined. Since the third plenary session 
of the 11th party Central Committee, the party's various 
policies toward rural areas have aroused the enthusiasm of 
peasants. The reason these policies have been well received by 
peasants is that they have represented and safeguarded the 
interests of the vast number of peasants. Since the beginning 
of this year, however, some problems of the rural work have 
emerged regarding the important issue of protecting the 
interests of peasants. The price difference between industrial 
and agricultural products have been widened, the comparative 
efficiency of agriculture has declined, and the income of 
peasants has increased slowly, thus leading to a decline in the 
enthusiasm of peasants in growing grain. Since the beginning of 
this winter, a few localities in the province have again 
witnessed the phenomena of indiscriminately raising funds and 
collecting financial levies, some other localities have even 
tried to find excuses to withdraw the contracted fields from 
peasants upon which they rely for existence. Thus, peasants say 
that the benefits given them at the beginning of the year 
according to the policy of reducing peasants' burdens are now 
being withdrawn gradually. 
  Why does the phenomenon of infringing upon the interests of 
peasants emerge? There are two reasons. First, some leading 
comrades have only caught sight of the achievements in the rural 
reform, but have not discovered in a timely manner the new 
contradictions and new problems cropping up in the rural areas 
when rural areas begin embarking in the market economy and have 
not set forth in a timely manner the measures coordinated with 
the deepening of rural reform. Second, we have overestimated the 
degree of prosperity of peasants since the commencement of rural 
reform and overestimated peasants' capacity to adapt themselves 
to rural reform. In fact, although the province has reaped 
bumper harvest in agriculture for four years running, only a 
small number of peasants have truly become relatively well-off 
or rich, and most peasants just have enough to eat and wear. In 
the three state-level poverty-stricken counties and the 13 
provincial-level poverty-stricken counties, considerably more 
people are still struggling against hunger and cold. Under such 
a situation, all fields ought to yield even more support to 
peasants to let them rest and build up strength and then 
continue to develop production in order to thoroughly extricate 
them from poverty. 
  Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
stressed again and again at the just closed provincial rural 
work conference that all localities should consider the 
interests of both the state and the peasants when drawing up and 
implementing agricultural policies and should formulate some 
policies that are in agreement with the interests of peasants. 
This is a key step to protect peasants' interests. In doing 
the practical work at present, we should pay attention to the 
following three things: The policy of reducing peasants' 
burdens cannot be wavered; IOU slips cannot be given when 
procuring agricultural and sideline products from peasants; and 
the advantages given to peasants according to the contracts 
signed between the state and peasants must be honored and no 
cases of cheating and pocketing the interests of peasants are 
allowed. As long as we no longer make peasants the first target 
of attack in the course of deepening rural reform and actually 
protect the interests of peasants, it is possible for us to push 
agriculture into a new stage.

grass-roots level party building and two-reform activities ended

speech. He stressed the need for party-member cadres throughout

Manner, and Expediting the Pace of Reform, Opening Up, and 
Macromodernization in Our Province." 
  In his speech, Liu Fangren pointed out that the general

comprehensively promote the establishment of Gansu's socialist 
market economic structure, its party building, its spiritual

  Liu Fangren continued: The year 1994 is a crucial one for 
reform and opening up in which it is necessary to seize the 
opportunity, boost our morale, and move forward by overcoming 
difficulties. There are thousands of jobs to fulfill in 1994 but 
all jobs should focus on economic construction. [passage 
omitted] 
  Liu Fangren said: The pace of reform will be very big this 
year and we will see the most reform measures with the strongest 
momentum for more than 10 years. [passage omitted] 
  In his speech, Liu Fangren stressed: The crux of speeding up 
economic development, deepening structural reform, preserving

this year is to improve all party organizations in the province, 
to strengthen the party's ideological style and organizational 
build up, and to enhance the leadership level of party 
organizations in all localities and their ability to control the 
overall situation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The provincial party committee's Standing Committee 
held this year's first plenary session in Chengdu yesterday. 
Standing Committee members discussed how to deepen the struggle 
against corruption. They pointed out the need to persist in the 
guiding principles set by the party Central Committee for the 
first-phase struggle against corruption and to consider and 
carry out the struggle against corruption in line with the 
overall situation of expediting the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure and maintaining the 
sustained, speedy, and healthy development of the national 
economy. 
  The session listened to a report by Yang Tonghui, member of 
the provincial party committee's Standing Committee and 
secretary of the discipline inspection commission, on last 
year's struggle against corruption in the province and on 
proposals for the future struggle against corruption. 
  At the session, provincial party Secretary Xie Shijie 
stressed: Leadership should be strengthened over the struggle 
against corruption, the provincial party committee and 
government, as well as party committees and governments at all 
levels, should regard the struggle against corruption as an 
important political task, put it on their agenda, and carry it 
out persistently. The party Central Committee has set three 
requirements for the current struggle against corruption. These 
three requirements should be implemented in the period up to the 
Spring Festival so as to make phased achievements. This year's 
struggle against corruption will be arranged by the provincial 
party committee in light of Sichuan's actual conditions 
according to the Central Committee's plan. 
  Xie Shijie pointed out: In our work, we should play the 
exemplary role of leading cadres, strengthen education against 
corruption and for a clean administration, and conscientiously 
abide by the system of cadres reporting major cases and the 
system of maintaining files for clean administration. In the 
course of rectifying arbitrary collections of charges, we should 
straighten out malpractices in using special funds, examine and 
deal with major and important cases, pay proper attention to 
strengthening discipline in key departments, resolve problems by 
looking into their root causes and symptoms, constantly make 
phased achievements in a down-to-earth manner, and profoundly 
and protractedly carry out the struggle against corruption so as 
to ensure the smooth fulfillment of all tasks this year and to 
promote the better and faster development of the province's 
reform, opening up, and conomic construction.

  [Excerpts] In the conference room of the provincial party 
committee yesterday morning, provincial party Secretary Xie 
Shijie listened to feedback reports by comrades in charge of the 
provincial literature and art federation, writers' association, 
academy of social sciences, and federation of social sciences, 
and made an important speech on strengthening theoretical work, 
literature and art, and two civilizations in Sichuan. [passage 
omitted] 
  After listening to these feedback reports, Comrade Xie 
Shijie 
said happily: Last year our province made marked achievements 
in theoretical work as well as literature and art, and people in 
these fields made great contributions. Good results were 
produced in social scientific research as well as in literature 
and art creation. A new step forward was made in the province's 
spiritual civilization. 
  Xie Shijie stressed: We are building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, carrying out building spiritual and material 
civilizations simultaneously, and promoting overall social 
progress in the course of economic construction. This is an 
important aspect of socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
[passage omitted] 
  Xie Shijie said: Not long ago, the sixth provincial party 
committee held its second session to arrange this year's work. 
The main idea is to seize the opportunity to deepen reform, 
widen the scope of opening up, and expedite development. To 
fulfill this year's arduous tasks, there is a need to mobilize 
forces in all fields and to bring into play initiative in all 
aspects. Comrades in theoretical, literature, and art circles 
have heavy responsibilities to undertake and should make new 
contributions to the development of Sichuan's two civilizations.

Province, became the first trader of stocks at the Lhasa Stock 
Trading Center. Qiu was said to have traded in 1,000 shares 
listed by a local firm of Nanjing, provincial capital of Jiangsu. 
  The main trading hall, covering a floor space of more than

  [Text] Lhasa, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Autonomous 
Region has its first vice-chairwoman of the regional government 
since Cering Zhouga took office in the regional government at 
the end of last year. 
  Cering Zhouga has served as the head of the Department of 
Public Health in Tibet for about 22 years. 
  In 1971, the 27-year-old woman was appointed deputy director 
of the regional Department of Public Health and, in 1980, 
promoted to the department's directorship. 
  Before 1951, there was no modern medical service in Tibet. 
With public health service in Tibet starting from a backward 
state, Cering Zhouga was among the first generation of Tibetan 
medical staff cultivated in New China. 
  In 1955, Cering Zhouga joined a medical team of the People's 
Liberation Army in her hometown, Zedang of Shannan Prefecture. 
In the summer of 1957, she was sent to study at the department 
of medicine in the Northwest China Institute of Nationalities. 
  After graduation in 1963, she engaged in public health work 
in Tibet. 
  In Tibetan language, Cering means long life and Zhouga 
implies goddess. In Tibetan people's minds, Cering Zhouga is 
like a "goddess of longevity." 
  But, the vice-chairwoman has not always enjoyed a smooth 
life. She lost her mother as soon as she was born in 1943. At 
the age of seven, she became a maid in a rich man's house and 
toiled there for five years. 
  "It was the People's Liberation Army sent by the Communist 
Party of China that liberated us serfs," she said. 
  Cering Zhouga is confident in her work but also feels a kind 
of pressure. She said, "to be a vice-chairwoman, I must do some 
down-to-earth work for the people."

Enlarged Plenary Session of the Eighth Jiangsu Provincial CPC 
Committee, Sums Up This Year's Work, Outlines Tasks for 1994, 
Calls for Resolutely Accelerating Reform and Development, and 
for Thoroughly Implementing the Guidelines of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday afternoon, Secretary Chen Huanyou 
delivered an important report at the Seventh Enlarged Plenary 
Session of the Eighth Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee on behalf 
of the provincial party committee's Standing Committee. He 
reviewed and summed up Jiangsu's work in the past year, called 
for studying and implementing the guidelines of the Third 
Plenary Session of 14th CPC Central Committee, and made 
suggestions for tasks in 1994. Sun Jiazheng, deputy secretary 
of the provincial party committee, presided over the session. 
  Chen Huanyou said: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee is an important historic meeting, and the 
"Decision on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a 
Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted by the session is a 
program of action which will guide us in pushing forward the 
reform of the economic structure in the 1990's. We must 
concentrate on implementing it from three aspects. [passage 
omitted] 
  Firmly reaffirming the achievements made in this year's 
work, 
Chen Huanyou said: Since the beginning of this year, all 
localities in our province have earnestly implemented the 
guidelines in the important remarks made by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping during his tour of southern China in early 1992 and the 
guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress, continued to 
seize opportunities, deepen reforms, open wider to the outside 
world, strengthen and improve our macroeconomic control, 
accelerate structural adjustments, speed up scientific and 
technological advances, and adhere to the principle of building 
a material civilization and a spiritual civilization 
simultaneously. As a result, the economy has been able to 
maintain its momentum of rapid growth. New progress has been 
made in building a spiritual civilization, in developing 
democracy and improving the legal system, and in strengthening 
the party organizationally. The general situation is good. The 
economy has been developing in a sustained and rapid way. The 
province's GNP this year is expected to increase by 18.5 percent 
over that of last year. New advances have been made in reform, 
and a new situation has developed in our export-oriented 
economy. According to estimates, our foreign exchange earnings 
made through exports this year are expected to rise 17.8 
percent; the actual amount of utilized foreign capital has 
increased 69.5 percent; and about 9,000 joint-venture, 
foreign-funded, and cooperative enterprises have been approved. 
New achievements have been made in the development of science, 
technology, and education. New progress has been made in 
building a spiritual civilization. Party building has been 
strengthened. 
  Chen Huanyou analyzed and explained the distinguishing 
features of this year's work as follows: First, we vigorously 
and comprehensively implemented the state's macroeconomic 
control measures, and took full advantage of the development 
opportunities. Under the circumstances of a tightened 
macroeconomic environment, we firmly and continuously fostered 
the thinking that "Development is the last word," and sought to 
develop as fast and efficiently as possible. Second, while 
maintaining a higher growth rate, we strove to improve the 
quality of economic operation. We notably strengthened our 
sense of the economy of scale in development, of bringing about 
coordinated development of various industries, and of relying on 
science and technology for progress. We also paid more attention 
to the substance of economic development and the quality of 
economic growth. Third, we found opportunities in the 
transition from the old to the new structure to further 
intensify reform and promote self-sustained economic growth. 
Fourth, we constantly upheld the policy of fostering both 
material and cultural and ideological progress, and attaching 
equal importance to both; we made overall plans and successfully 
arranged work in all fields; we mobilized the initiative of all 
cadres and the masses to create a favorable social environment 
in which the general situation was stable and everyone tried to 
make progress. Chen Huanyou pointed out that there are still 
difficulties and problems regarding capital, market, and 
commodity prices that should be taken seriously. He stressed 
the need to earnestly overcome these difficulties and resolve 
the problems in the course of conducting our work hereafter. 
  Chen Huanyou pointed out: The year 1994 will be crucial to 
economic structural reform, and it will be a year of sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the economy. The general 
requirements for next year's work are: Guided by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, we need to 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th National 
Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, further emancipate our minds, seek truth from 
facts, and firmly seize the opportunity; we need to further 
intensify reform and accelerate the pace of building a new 
socialist market economic structure; we need to open wider to 
the outside world and accelerate the process of 
internationalizing Jiangsu's economy; further accelerate 
structural adjustment, raise economic standards and returns, and 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
economy; we need to strengthen the building of socialist 
spiritual civilization and the work of combating corruption and 
building a clean government; and we need to strengthen party 
building and promote social progress in all fields. In light of 
the general requirements and development goals, it is necessary 
to concentrate on carrying out work in the following six areas: 
  Accelerate the pace of reform, centering on building 
the basic framework of socialist market economic structure. 
[passage omitted] 
  Seize the opportunity of foreign trade structural 
reform to accelerate outward expansion. [passage omitted] 
  Accelerate structural adjustment, centering on 
improving economic returns. [passage omitted] 
  Make full use of each region's strong points to promote 
simultaneous development of the provincial economy. 
[passage omitted] 
  Further strengthen the building of spiritual 
civilization, democracy, and the legal system by upholding the 
policy of fostering both material and cultural and ideological 
progress, and attaching equal importance to both. [passage 
omitted] 
  Strengthen party building and improve leadership 
standards. [passage omitted] 
  Concluding his report, Chen Huanyou said: The provincial 
party committee calls on the vast numbers of cadres and masses 
in the province to closely rally around the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core; always act in 
accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the party's basic 
line; comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th 
National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee; and work with one heart and one 
mind, with a will to make the country strong, and in a 
pioneering and enterprising spirit to win new victories for 
Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and modernization.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 11 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai witnessed 
sharp growth in its commercial sector last year, according to a 
recent survey by the commercial department here. 
  It shows that great changes took place in the following ten 
aspects of the city's commercial sector. 
  Despite the fluctuating market, the city achieved a 
sustained 
high growth in retail sales, with total turnover for 1993 
amounting to 65.35 billion yuan. 
  This was an increase of 33.5 percent on 1992, and 11.5 
percentage points higher than the national average growth rate. 
  In an effort to establish a socialist market economic 
structure, it also expanded the market for consumer goods, 
removed various kinds of fees and brought the market economy 
into play. 
  A new system for retail price control, professional 
negotiation for prices, overall control and major commodity 
reserves, also took initial shape. 
  In addition, Shanghai established a number of exchanges and 
wholesale markets of national level for petroleum, farming 
resources, food, oil and meat. 
  Taking the food and oil exchange as an example, the trading 
volume of food-stuff and oil in the first six months since its 
founding reached 31.3 million tons, totalling 54.2 billion yuan. 
It made contact with many of the world major food exchanges, 
and with REUTER's international high-speed information network. 
  The city has also set up 204 regional markets, constituting 
an initial commodity market system. 
  So far, about 700 large and medium-sized commercial firms in 
Shanghai have adopted the independent management system, with 
4,177 small ones practising leasing and risk liability 
contracting systems. 
  Some 168 such companies were sold by auction, and 28 
comprehensive chambers of commerce and commercial groups were 
reorganized. 
  The city also approved 19 joint stock companies, six of 
which 
were listed on the market. 
  In 1993, the city earmarked at least 7.8 billion yuan for 
commercial development, about 1.5 times the amount in the 
previous year. 
  There were 50 major commercial projects with an investment 
of 
over 30 million yuan each, with 12 completed and nine in their 
final stage. 
  To gain more strength in developing the city's commercial 
sector, it made use of a total overseas investment of 660 
million U.S. dollars, a rise of 2.24 times the figure in 1992. 
  With its 179 foreign-financed projects approved last year, 
1.77 times the number of the previous year, Shanghai has now 354 
foreign- funded projects, totalling about 1.9 billion U.S. 
dollars, including foreign funds of 958 million U.S. dollars. 
  As a result, the city's total export value surpassed 100 
million U.S. dollars last year, and nine overseas commercial 
firms were set up. 
  Also, the city has quickened its paces in developing the new 
commercial streets in Pudong new zone. 
  The two-kilometer-long Wenden commercial street was 
completed 
in less than one year. Its turnover in half a year topped one 
billion yuan. 
  The building of 17 large projects in the area of the Yangpu 
business center has already started. They are expected to be 
completed in two years. 
  To meet the demands of the fast development in the sector, 
the city government is also accelerating the training process 
for financial and trading personnel. About 59,100 people 
received various kinds of business training last year.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Jan (MENA)--Chinese State Council Premier 
Li Peng has expressed his support for President Husni Mubarak's 
call for declaring the Middle East a zone free of weapons, mass 
destruction and especially nuclear weapons. He said China was 
the lead country among the five nuclear powers to commit itself 
to not being first to use nuclear weapons. 
  In a newspaper interview published in AL-AHRAM today, Li 
Peng 
welcomed the recent progress in the Arab-Israeli talks, 
describing it as a good beginning to settle the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. But the Chinese premier said a real settlement of the 
conflict requires both sides to keep trying to overcome the 
various obstacles until permanent peace is achieved. 
  Li Peng said he believed the end of the Cold War has not 
brought people security and reassurance. He said the developing 
countries' economic suffering has increased and regional 
conflicts have continued. He noted that peace and 
development--two basic issues in our age--have not seen the 
light of solution. 
  Li Peng said China, itself a developing country, considers 
good relations with the developing countries a mainstay of its 
foreign policy. China expresses its great sympathy with the 
plight of the developing countries. 
  On the march of development in China, Li Peng noted that his 
country has recorded a high annual growth rate of 8.9 percent. 
Gross national product increased 12.8 percent in 1992 on the 
figure for 1991. Grain production reached 450 million tons. 
  Li Peng said his country encourages foreign investors as 
part 
of its socialist market economy. He explained that over 50,000 
establishments with an investment of $50 billion dollars were 
operating in China by the end of September 1993. Their 
participation in industrial production amounts to 6 percent of 
total production and 20 percent of China's total exports.

Li Lanqing respectively met with Abdul Rahman Houti, chairman of 
the board of public authority for assessment of compensation for 
damages resulting from Iraqi aggression, and Daniel K. Akaka,

  When meeting Houti, Li said China is paying constant 
attention to the situation in the Gulf region, and always 
endorses respect for the sovereignty, independence and 
territorial integrity of Kuwait, and the full implementation of 
resolutions adopted by the U.N. Security Council. 
  Li said it is three years since the Gulf crisis, and China 
hopes the problems left by the crisis will be resolved as soon 
as possible so as to safeguard peace and stability there. 
  "As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China 
is 
willing to make its efforts along with the countries in the Gulf 
region and the international community to this end," Li added. 
  Li recalled the days he visited Kuwait last June, saying 
that 
the Kuwait Government and its people had exerted great efforts 
to heal the damages caused by the war, reconstruct their 
homeland and reinvigorate their economy, and made remarkable 
achievements. 
  Li pointed out that through joint efforts of the two 
governments, Sino-Kuwaiti friendship and cooperation will be 
furthered. 
  Houty briefed Li on Kuwait's losses in the Gulf war and 
Kuwait's stand on compensation for war damages, and thanked the 
Chinese Government and people for their help and support for 
Kuwait during the Gulf crisis and war.

World Economic Situation and Characteristics"] 
  [Text] With the economy still growing slowly and various 
contradictions and conflicts intertwining, the present world is 
undergoing profound changes in terms of economic pattern, 
structure, and industrial structure. These changes will exert 
far-reaching influence on future world economic growth. 
  The recovery of the Western economies was still weak this 
year. After experiencing a "soft recovery" for two and a half 
years, GDP growth topped 3 percent in the second half of this 
year and annual growth will be around 2.8 percent. And yet, due 
to many chronic afflictions, the U.S. economy is still troubled 
by serious financial and foreign trade deficits. After dropping 
for three consecutive years, the EC economy is likely to 
register negative growth of 0.5 percent this year; with the 
number of unemployed at 18 million, there have been frequent 
strikes in various countries. The Japanese economy is still in 
the doldrums and Japan will register its first zero growth since 
World War II. 
  Some headway has been made in creating private enterprises 
in 
the CIS countries, but economic chaos has not been brought under 
control. Industrial output will drop by 16 percent this year, 
the inflation rate stands at 2,000 percent, and the people's 
living standards are continuing to drop. The economic situation 
in East European countries is different, with Poland, the Czech 
Republic, and Hungary scoring some achievements in their change 
toward a market economy and their industrial production tending 
to stabilize or pick up. 
  Average economic growth in the developing countries was 
about 
5.6 percent but there were considerable differences among 
different countries. In Latin America, most countries' 
economies have improved for three consecutive years, their gross 
output value has grown by about 3 percent, and they have 
improved their ability to absorb foreign capital. In Africa, 
the annual economic growth rate is about 1.6 percent, lagging 
far behind its 3-percent population growth. The Asian economy 
is still upbeat, with economic growth standing at about 7 
percent. Economic growth in East Asia will reach 8 percent, 
ranking first in terms of world economic growth for several 
years running. East Asia is after all regarded as the area with 
the most dynamic economic growth in the world. 
  The tide of economic reform is sweeping practically all 
countries and regions in the east, west, north, and south. All 
countries, developed or developing, are striving for development 
through change. Soon after taking office, Clinton put forward a 
whole set of programs for reforming and rejuvenating the 
American economy. EC countries are focusing on changes in four 
aspects, i.e. increasing employment, reforming their welfare 
systems, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and 
accelerating the shift from scientific research to production. 
Japan is focussing on reforming its monetary system, 
strengthening basic scientific research, and readjusting 
existing employment and operational mechanisms, as well as 
expanding internal demand and gradually opening up the domestic 
market. The CIS and East European countries are expediting the 
transformation of their economies. A number of new emerging 
industrialized countries and regions, which are rising suddenly 
in East Asia, are encouraging large numbers of developing 
countries to explore modes suited to their economic development. 
  The trends toward regional economic blocs and world economic 
integration are developing further, with economic competition 
and mergers going hand in hand. Early this year, a big market 
of 12 EC countries began to operate. Following the final 
approval of the Maastricht Treaty after many twists and turns, 
the construction of a European Alliance has started. The 
European Economic Area pact will also come into effect in 
January 1994 and the process of European integration is still 
developing in accordance with the idea of three "concentric 
circles." The United States, Canada, and Mexico have approved 
the North American Free Trade Agreement in Congress. [as 
published] Some time ago, a Seattle meeting of the leaders of 
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization, which 
attracted widespread attention in the international community, 
put forward the idea of open regional economic and trade 
cooperation. 
  The sustained, high-speed development and sudden rise of the 
Asian economy, especially the East Asian economy, has further 
enhanced the region's economic status. The rate of Asia's 
economic development this year is about three times that of 
world economic development. Economic regional alliances, 
subregional alliances, and other forms of development in the 
Asian region are emerging one after another. In the face of 
such a uniquely good economic situation in East Asia, the U.S. 
Government has openly indicated, "looking forward into the 21st 
century, no other region is more important to the prosperity and 
stability of the United States than the Pacific rim region." 
  The world's finances are still weak. It is increasingly 
difficult for the old world and regional monetary coordination 
mechanisms to play their roles. The crisis in the European 
currency system and the great appreciation of the Japanese yen, 
which have come one after another this year, indicate a drastic 
increase in the volatility of international finance. To 
stimulate economic recovery, the United States has reduced its 
short-term interest rates to a record low. Japan has basically 
followed the trend in U.S. interest rates. To control inflation 
and maintain the dominant role of the Deutsch Mark among 
European currencies, Germany has kept its high interest rates 
unchanged for a long time. Monetary turmoil has also found 
expression in violent fluctuations of stock markets. Since the 
bursting of Japan's "bubble economy," the Nikkei Index has 
dropped continuously and so have stock markets in Germany and 
France. [sentence as published] 
  State intervention has increased and economic diplomacy is 
the order of the day. With the general slump of the Western 
economy, there is turmoil in society. This has directly 
affected the position of the ruling parties, leading to changes 
in some governments. Consequently, developed countries have 
extensively increased macroeconomic regulation and control and 
formulated a series of measures and plans to stimulate and 
develop the economy. They have further enhanced the status of 
economic security in international relations and tried hard to 
gain a favorable position in the midst of fierce international 
competition. State intervention has also involved credits, 
investment, foreign aid, trade, and even private investment. 
These countries have kept exchange rates and technological 
transfers under stricter control. 
  The world economy will still face many difficulties next 
year 
but favorable factors will also increase. The overall situation 
is expected to be better than this year.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Wei (2621 0251): "Qian Qichen Starts a </F>
Visit to Six African Nations"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Qian Qichen, 
Chinese vice premier and foreign minister, will start his 
foreign visits in the new year and set off tomorrow to visit six 
African countries: Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Kenya, Madagascar, 
and Mauritius. He will exchange opinions with leaders of the 
six countries on the international situation, African affairs, 
bilateral relations, and other issues of common interest. 
  The Chinese foreign minister has been faithfully and 
creatively performing his duties and carrying out intense 
diplomatic activities. Last year, he not only received foreign 
counterparts at home, but also made 10 visits to foreign 
countries to attend international conferences. In particular, 
he accompanied PRC President Jiang Zemin when he attended the 
informal Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization summit 
meeting, and held an official meeting with U.S. President 
Clinton in Seattle, then he accompanied Jiang Zemin on his visit 
to Cuba, Brazil, and Portugal. 
  Strengthening and developing unity and cooperation with 
Third 
World countries is a basic foothold of China's independent and 
peace-oriented foreign policy. At the beginning of the new 
year, Qian Qichen's visit to the six African countries 
demonstrates this. 
  Qian Qichen has mentioned many times that China attaches 
importance to friendly cooperation with the African countries, 
and always respects and supports their decisions to select their 
own political systems and develop paths according to their own 
national conditions. On the eve of his visit to African 
countries in early 1993, he particularly stressed that it is not 
good to neglect Africa or try to impose one's own ideas on 
Africa. People should care about Africa, and respect the 
choices made by the African nations and their people. 
  It was learned that before Qian Qichen became China's 
seventh 
foreign minister in 1988, he had already visited 21 of the 53 
African countries.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, January 11 (XINHUA) -- Ethiopian 
Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin hailed China's support for the 
third world at a dinner he hosted in honor of visiting Chinese 
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today. 
  In his welcoming remarks, Mesfin said that "we in the 
transitional government attach a very special importance to our 
relations with the People's Republic of China." 
  He said, among the reasons for it, the Ethiopian people have 
always "considered the support and the assistance of the 
People's Republic of China as exemplary in international 
co-operation." 
  "The Ethiopian peasants in numerous parts of our country 
have 
very fond memories of Chinese experts and the work they have 
left behind will always remain as a monument to the friendship 
between our two peoples," he said. 
  "It is not only here in Ethiopia that the People's Republic 
of China and its people are held in a very high esteem. In the 
developing world in general, the People's Republic of China is 
viewed in a special light and is regarded as a true friend of 
their peoples and a genuine supporter of their causes," he added. 
  In his reply speech, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen hailed the achievements the Ethiopian 
transitional government made during the past two year. 
  Qian Qichen said "as an important country in east Africa, 
Ethiopia is firmly committed to good-neighboring and regional 
peace, and has played a positive role in promoting a political 
settlement of the Somali question, thus winning wide acclaim 
from the international community." 
  Ethiopia actively advocates that African countries, under 
current unfavorable international political and economic 
situation, unite to strengthen themselves and advocate the 
African economic integration, he said, expressing deep 
appreciation of it. 
  "To consolidate and strengthen unity and cooperation with 
African countries is an important component of China's foreign 
policy," the Chinese vice-premier said, adding China supports 
the African countries in their efforts to strengthen themselves 
through unity and cooperation and respects their desire to 
choose the road of development suited to their respective 
national conditions. 
  The Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister arrived here 
today on a two-day visit to Ethiopia at the invitation of 
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin. During his first day 
of visit, he held talks respectively with Ethiopian Foreign 
Minister Seyoum and Chairman of the Constitution Drafting 
Commission Kifle Wedajo.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, January 11 (XINHUA) -- Ethiopian 
Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin and his visiting Chinese 
counterpart Qian Qichen held talks here today on the 
relationship between the two countries and some issues of common 
concern. 
  Mesfin said the relations between the two countries are very 
good, adding that Ethiopia has had a lot of support from and 
cooperation with China in achieving national unity and economic 
development. 
  He hailed the economic development in China as a great 
success, which he said will be a great encouragement to Ethiopia. 
  Qian Qichen, who is also Chinese vice-premier, said China 
treasures the friendship between the two countries and is 
willing to strengthen the cooperation on the basis of the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence. 
  Qian said, the realization of peace in Ethiopia after 30 
years of civil war shows what can be achieved by Ethiopia can 
also be attained by other similar African countries, so long 
clue efforts are made [as received]. 
  The Chinese vice-premier said Ethiopian national economy 
grows very fast, with a growth rate of 7.9 percent in 1992-93 
fiscal year. 
  Qian Qichen said at a time when Africa is facing many 
challenges and new difficulties, there have been varied 
approaches to the continent, some think human rights is the most 
important for Africa and others think it is the democratization. 
In the light of the practice of China, we hold that the most 
important tasks for Africa at present are: firstly to keep 
political and social stability which is the primary condition 
for the development of economy, secondly to develop economy 
which is the central task and fundamental goal of all work. 
Thirdly reform, only by which can all construction make 
progress. Stability is the condition, reform is the motive 
force, while development is the central task. 
  The Ethiopian foreign minister agreed with the analysis of 
the Chinese vice-premier, believing that stability and 
development is inseparable. 
  Qian Qichen also praised highly Ethiopia's policy of good 
neighborliness and regional peace. 
  He said Somali question is the most important one in Africa. 
China is paying great attention to the development in Somalia 
and sympathizing with the sufferings of the Somali people. 
  He said, the Somali issue can only be solved by the Somali 
people themselves, adding that the key to the peaceful solution 
of the Somali problem is to achieve a broad national 
reconciliation in Somalia. 
  However, Qian noted that the international community should 
help the Somali people to resolve the Somali issue, but should 
not do everything in their stead. 
  He also expressed the hope that all Somali factions could 
iron out the differences through discussions and dialogues and 
the Organization of African Unity and countries in the horn of 
Africa can play an important role in seeking a solution to the 
Somali issue.

and further promote their ties of friendship. 
  Rong made the remarks at a meeting with Zimbabwean

  Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, Sino-Zimbabwean 
relations in every field have developed steadily, and there have 
been frequent contacts at all levels, Rong said. 
  He expressed the belief that the current visit by Makombe 
would further promote the friendly ties between the two peoples, 
the two governments and the two parliaments. 
  China and Zimbabwe are both developing countries, Rong said,

international issues and that they can continue to cooperate 
with each other in this regard. 
  Makombe expressed his agreement.

for its support and assistance, Makombe said, adding that the 
visit was aimed at expanding the ties between the two 
parliaments and the two governments. 
  In response, Rong said China has provided Zimbabwe with some 
assistance within its means. Yet, China is still a developing 
country and the assistance is very limited. 
  He expressed the wish that in the future the two countries 
would further enhance their mutually beneficial cooperation in 
the economic and technological fields. 
  Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of China's National People's 
Congress Standing Committee, was present at the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government and the Lesotho Government decided to resume 
bilateral diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level as from 
today. 
  A joint communique to this effect was signed by Chinese 
Ambassador to Kenya Chen Pingchu and J.T. Motsing, high 
commissioner of Lesotho to Kenya, on behalf of each other's 
government, in Nairobi, capital of Kenya, on December 30, 1993. 
  The full text of the joint communique is as follows: 
  "The government of the People's Republic of China and the 
government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, in conformity with the 
principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial 
integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each 
other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and 
peaceful co- existence, have decided to resume diplomatic 
relations at ambassadorial level effective from 12 January, 1994. 
  "The government of the People's Republic of China and the 
government of the Kingdom of Lesotho have agreed to exchange 
ambassadors and facilitate the resumption of work by each 
other's embassy. 
  "The government of the People's Republic of China supports 
Lesotho in its efforts to safeguard state sovereignty and 
develop the economy. The government of the Kingdom of Lesotho 
recognizes that the government of the People's Republic of China 
is the sole legal government of China and Taiwan is an 
inalienable part of Chinese territory. The government of the 
People's Republic of China appreciates the above position of the 
government of the Kingdom of Lesotho." 
  Lesotho established diplomatic ties with China in 1983 after 
severing its "diplomatic relations" with Taiwan. 
  In April, 1990, Lesotho announced that it resumed 
"diplomatic 
relations" with Taiwan. China promptly announced the 
termination of its diplomatic relations with Lesotho.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The upcoming visit 
to three West-European countries by Qiao Shi, chairman of 
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, 
will be another major move to promote contacts between the NPC 
and foreign parliaments, following his five-ASEAN nation tour 
last year. 
  These remarks were made by Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the 
NPC Standing Committee, at a meeting here today with Chinese 
correspondents who are going to cover the event. 
  He said the upcoming visit shows that China places great 
importance on its cooperation with Germany, Switzerland and 
Austria in the fields of politics, economy and trade, science 
and technology as well as culture. 
  It is also a symbol that China desires to develop its 
long-term and stable friendly ties with the three countries, 
based on the principles of seeking common ground while reserving 
differences, mutual respect, non-interference in each other's 
internal affairs and equality and mutual benefit. 
  Qiao is scheduled to pay an official goodwill visit to the 
three countries from January 16 to 30 at the invitation of the 
Presidium of the Bundestag of Germany, President Gert Haller of 
the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland, and 
President Heinz Fischer of the National Council of Austria. 
  Qiao is China's first NPC chairman to visit West European 
countries, Cao said. 
  He noted that the diplomatic work of the NPC and its 
Standing 
Committee is an important component part of China's entire 
diplomacy. 
  To conduct friendly contacts in a planned way between the 
NPC 
and its standing committee on the one hand and foreign 
parliaments on the other, according to China's foreign policies 
and principles, is of great significance to deepening mutual 
understanding and friendship, promoting the state-to-state 
relations and creating a better international environment for 
the country's modernization drive and reform and opening to the 
outside world, he said. 
  Cao said between July and August last year, Qiao paid a 
successful visit to the five ASEAN nations of Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines, which 
strengthened bilateral relations and regional economic 
cooperative ties. 
  The visit also pushed forward the friendly ties and 
cooperation between the NPC and the ASEAN countries' 
parliaments, contributing to safeguarding the regional peace and 
stability, he said. 
  Cao disclosed that during his visit, Qiao is expected to 
exchange views with the parliament and government leaders of the 
three countries on bilateral relations, exchanges and 
cooperation between the NPC and the those parliaments as well as 
international issues of common concern. 
  Qiao will also visit some enterprises, scientific and 
research institutions, schools and ports and make wide contacts 
with personages from all walks of life, he added. 
  Cao said China has enjoyed a long history of friendly 
contacts and traditional friendship with Germany, Switzerland 
and Austria. 
  The recent years have witnessed sound growth of bilateral 
relations in political, economic, cultural, scientific and 
technological fields. The exchange of visits between the NPC 
and the parliaments of these countries has increased, thus 
bringing their relationship closer, Cao said. 
  He said the NPC is ready to further its relationship with 
the 
parliaments of the three countries, maintain its frequent 
exchanges of visits with their parliamentary leaders. 
  He expressed the belief that QIAO's visit is bound to give 
an 
impetus to the promotion of the ties between China and these 
three countries and exchanges and cooperation between the NPC 
and the parliaments in these countries.

with Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu. 
  The two sides have reached the following conclusions through 
these talks: 
  Both sides believe that China and France should restore 
their 
traditional friendly relations and cooperation on the basis of 
the principles on which the two countries established diplomatic 
relations. 
  The Chinese side has reaffirmed its consistent position on 
the question of Taiwan. The French side has confirmed that the 
French Government recognizes the Government of the People's 
Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and 
Taiwan as an integral part of Chinese territory. 
  The Chinese side reaffirms that arms sale of any type to 
Taiwan will bring harm to China's sovereignty, security and 
reunification, and that the Chinese Government will be firmly 
opposed to that. In view of the concerns of the Chinese side, 
the French Government has undertaken not to authorize any French 
enterprises to participate in the arming of Taiwan. 
  The Chinese Government and the French Government wish to 
intensify their political consultations, hold regular meetings 
and develop economic and trade cooperation between them. The 
Chinese side welcomes participation by French enterprises in 
competition on the Chinese market on an equal footing. 
  The two sides have agreed that Mr. Edouard Balladur, prime 
minister of France, will pay an official visit to China in the 
near future.

  [Text] Beijing, January 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin called for closer coordination of various aspects in 
new- technology and high-tech development. 
  Jiang, during an inspection of the Beijing Emulation Center 
today, said that redoubled efforts should be made to promote 
multi- faceted coordination in order to bring high-tech 
advantages into full play and speed up upgrading of technical 
equipment and personnel quality. 
  Such a coordination, he added, also helps to promote much 
wider use of new and high-tech achievements in the country's 
socialist modernization drive. 
  Emulation is a new and high technology to which many 
developed countries have attached great importance. It is 
widely used in national defence and economic construction. It 
helps scientists in analyzing, testing and improving different 
large projects. The Beijing Emulation Center is one of the 
biggest now in the world. 
  Jiang also visited the key laboratories in the center and 
highly spoke of the achievements the Chinese scientists had made. 
  Emulation technology is based on cybernetics, the 
resemblance 
principle and computer technology, used to study real or 
supposed systems with the aid of system models.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Inmarsat 
[International Maritime Satellite], the international mobile 
communications satellite operator, inaugurated its first 
regional office in Beijing today. 
  Inmarsat is a cooperative with 71 member countries which 
operates a system of satellites to provide mobile voice and data 
communications to land-based users, ships and aircraft. At 
present, more than 30,000 Inmarsat mobile terminals are in use 
in more than 165 countries. 
  The Ministry of Communications is Inmarsat's Chinese 
contracting party, while the Beijing Marine Communications and 
Navigation Company (BMCNC) joined the organization on behalf of 
China. 
  Olof Lundberg, Inmarsat's director general, said at a press 
conference in Beijing today that the aim of the resident office 
is to promote exchanges between Inmarsat and China, trying to 
introduce advanced telecommunication technologies to more 
Chinese departments. 
  At the primary stage the office will mainly develop its 
business in China, while in the future it will expand its 
business to the whole Asia-Pacific area. 
  Building of Beijing Inmarsat earth stations, constructed and 
managed by the BMCNC, was finished in June 1991 and July 1993, 
respectively, and Beijing Inmarsat-A and Inmarsat-C earth 
stations have already been operational to cover the Indian Ocean 
and Pacific Ocean areas. 
  By the end of 1993 Inmarsat had more than 550 various 
terminal users in China.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Great progress was 
made in 1993 in the expansion of relations across the Taiwan 
Straits, a senior official said today. 
  Addressing a meeting of the Association for Relations Across 
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) which opened here today, ARATS 
President Wang Daohan said that his association was successful 
in its work in 1993. 
  The association, a non-governmental body, serves to promote 
contacts across the Taiwan Straits and the eventual 
reunification of China. 
  Wang praised the "Wang-Koo" [Gu] meeting -- a meeting 
between 
him and Koo Chen-fu [Gu Zhenfu], chairman of the Straits 
Exchange Foundation from Taiwan, held in Singapore last year. 
  "The meeting made it possible for high-ranking officials 
across the straits to discuss matters for the first time in the 
capacity of non-governmental officials," he said. 
  That meeting marked a "major historical step" in the across- 
straits relations and a "new stage" in ARATS' work, he added. 
  Wang Daohan said that Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the 
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, and Vice-Premier Qian 
Qichen have paid close attention to ARATS' work and have issued 
instructions on its work. 
  He also expressed thanks to Chinese Vice-President Rong 
Yiren 
and to Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the National Committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, for 
their contributions to the ARATS establishment and to its work. 
  He said that during the ongoing meeting, participants will 
discuss ARATS' tasks in the new year and ways to improve ARATS' 
work, so that the organization will be able to play a greater 
role in promoting across-straits contacts and relations, and 
achieving peaceful reunification of the motherland. 
  Wang expressed the belief that the deepening of the reform, 
opening wider to the outside world and rapid and steady growth 
of the economy in the mainland this year will certainly push 
forward the across-straits relations in the direction of 
peaceful reunification. 
  According to participants, Jing Shuping will no longer serve 
as an ARATS vice-president on the grounds that he is now the 
chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. 
Instead he will serve as an ARATS adviser. 
  Zheng Hongye, chairman of the China Council for the 
Promotion 
of International Trade, will also serve as an ARATS adviser.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (CNS)--The Mainland-based 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) and 
its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) 
are non- governmental organizations and should not be involved 
in political matters between the two sides, the Executive Vice 
President of ARATS, Mr. Tang Shubei, said here today. He added 
that the two sides should not deal with sensitive political 
issues in their working level talks. 
  Mr. Tang made these remarks in a report delivered at the 
third session of the first council of ARATS. He noted that 
certain new matters had arisen in the course of routine 
cross-strait talks on the implementation of the agreement 
reached by the heads of the two organizations. Since Taiwan had 
introduced into the working talks certain political and legal 
issues including matters which had not yet been settled, this, 
Mr. Tang said, was seen as a violation of the direction in which 
the two sides should be moving. He stressed that the two 
non-governmental organizations should base their work on 
economic and routine affairs. 
  Mr. Tang urged the Taiwan side to return to the consensus 
reached in the talks between the heads of the two groups, saying 
he hoped ways leading to a solution of routine matters would be 
found in a bid to reach an agreement acceptable to the two sides 
on the basis of mutual respect, equality, seeking truth from 
facts and common ground while reserving differences. The aim is 
to continue with the talks between the two sides in order to 
facilitate links and cooperation between them and to push 
forward cross-strait relations.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- An official of the 
Mainland Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits 
(ARATS) said today that talks between ARATs and the Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF) from Taiwan should keep off political 
topics. 
  Tang Shubei, vice-president of ARATS, said that political 
and 
legal issues on which the two sides are unlikely to achieve 
common ground should be excluded in talks between the two 
non-governmental organizations. 
  "As non-governmental organizations, ARATS and SEF should not 
be involved in political issues on which Taiwan and the mainland 
can hardly have common ground," Tang said. "We hope that in 
negotiations between the two sides, relevant departments in 
Taiwan will return to the common ground that the two 
organizations achieved during the Wang-Koo [Gu] meeting in 
Singapore last year." 
  During recent talks between the two sides, some SEF 
officials 
put forward such political and legal issues as "legal 
jurisdiction," which Tang said are not in accordance with the 
Wang-Koo agreement. 
  The Wang-Koo meeting was a non-governmental, economic and 
businesslike meeting, Tang said. The meeting has helped solve 
many problems which cropped up during exchanges across the 
Taiwan Straits and brought more contacts across the straits. 
  He said that ARATS has made continuous efforts following 
that 
meeting to implement the Wang-Koo agreement, and great progress 
has been achieved with efforts from both sides.

<F P=106> [Year-end commentary by XINHUA reporter Fan Liqing (5400 </F>
7787 7230): "There Are Still Repercussions From the Race for 
Power and a Shadow Hangs Over the Mainland Policy -- a Review of 
Taiwan's Political Situation in 1993"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Dec (XINHUA) -- Despite a little 
turbulence, on the whole Taiwan's political situation in 1993 
was stable. The outcome of a five-year power struggle within 
the ruling Kuomintang [KMT] was known this year. The faction in 
power guided and completed an inner-party power redistribution; 
the KMT consolidated the superiority it has enjoyed in local 
governments in the elections for "county magistrates and city 
mayors." During the year, though Taiwan somewhat relaxed the 
restrictions in its policy on cross-Strait two-way exchanges and 
put forward a "concept on promoting cross-Strait information 
exchange," the dispute over the one-China policy resurfaced and 
cast a new shadow over the development of cross-Strait relations 
because the Taiwan authorities increased the publicity of the 
concept of "giving priority to Taiwan" at home and vigorously 
conducted so-called "return-to-the- United Nations" activities 
abroad. 
  After Taiwan held elections for "Legislative Yuan members 
for 
the second term of office" at the end of 1992, the situation 
became was unstable for awhile in January 1993, with disputes 
revolving around whether "Executive Yuan Premier" Hao Po-tsun 
should resign when "Legislative Yuan members" for the next term 
of office were elected. Later, Hao Po-tsun quietly resigned 
seeing as he could not get support from the KMT Central 
Committee. The persistent power struggle and internecine strife 
among high-level KMT officials in the five years following the 
death of Jiang Jingguo [Chiang Ching- kuo] were brought to a 
temporary close with the resignation of Hao Po-tsun. It also 
signaled the end of an era in which high-level KMT officials of 
the older generation who followed Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan had 
been in power. 
  The KMT's "14th national party congress," which had been 
postponed for a year so, opened in August. Just when the 
congress was on the verge of a breakup, it completed a reluctant 
consolidation and reorganization of the KMT. At the meeting, 
the KMT created for the first time the positions of four vice 
chairmen; Li Denghui [Li Teng-hui] was reelected KMT chairman. 
The ruling faction completed the redistribution of leadership 
powers within the KMT through the "14th national party 
congress"; the new term of the KMT Central Committee boasted 
that "the KMT -- a 100-year-old shop -- has been transformed" 
and has the capital to "start anew." However, factional 
struggles within the KMT are still very intense and complicated; 
the KMT Central Committee cannot obtain a unanimous approval of 
its domestic and foreign policies by those inside the party; the 
race for power, contradictions between people who are natives of 
Taiwan and people who come from provinces other than Taiwan, 
differences in understanding and concepts, and other deep- 
rooted contradictions within the party are still looking for an 
opportunity to erupt. During the period of the "14th national 
party congress," a faction -- "the New KMT Alliance" -- within 
the KMT quit the party, established a new party, and actively 
took part in the campaign for "county magistrate and city 
mayoral" elections to be held at the end of the year. 
  This year [1993], the public has become even more wary of 
the ties between Taiwan authorities and the business sector, and 
some people have tried to restrain the KMT with slogans like: 
"fight against money politics" and "fight against special 
privileges." Against this background, the "Legislative Yuan" 
adopted the "Act of Publicizing Personnel's Property," known as 
the "Sunshine Act," in mid-1993, despite opposition from the 
KMT- controlled executive branch. After the "public personnel" 
publicized their property one group after another, people on 
Taiwan have found that those who owned property ranging from 10 
million new Taiwan dollars [NT] to several billion NT dollars 
are all high- ranking officials or "parliamentarians." The act 
has heightened people's awareness of Taiwan authorities' "money 
politics." 
  During Taiwan's quadrennial election of "county magistrates 
and mayors," which began in mid-November and ended on 27 
December, 77 candidates of the KMT, the Democratic Progress 
Party [DPP], and the New KMT Alliance Party, as well as 
independent candidates, vied for 23 seats. Since the DPP had 
overbearingly vowed to "become the ruling party within three 
years," the KMT regarded the election as a "campaign to defend 
the local political powers" and mobilized all KMT members to 
support the KMT candidates. In an unprecedented move, the KMT 
chairman and executive officials went all out to voice their 
support for candidates in districts within their jurisdictions. 
On the other hand, the DPP also considered the election as the 
first step "toward becoming the ruling party." During the 
election, instead of loudly advocating "Taiwan independence" as 
it did in the past, it repeatedly underscored its social welfare 
policies. The three-month-old New Party continued to advocate 
"opposition against money politics and special privileges," and 
used the election to test how big a space in which it could 
develop between the KMT and the DPP. The election process was 
replete with vicious attacks between candidates, lavish 
banquets, and "wanton bombings" with propagandistic materials. 
There was also endless violence and rumors of bribery. 
Although the KMT was able to keep the majority seats during the 
election, the total votes it acquired fell below 50 percent for 
the first time, and so it is likely that in the future it will 
face increasingly stronger challenges to its ruling status. 
  The two sides have made some headway in their business talks 
this year. They made a historic step forward in their relations 
with the signing of five agreements during the world-renowned 
talks between Wang Daohan and Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu], which took 
place in Singapore in April. For the sake that the agreements 
reached in the talks can be fully implemented, Taiwan's Strait 
Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the mainland's Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] have had three 
follow-up working consultations in Beijing, Xiamen, and Taibei 
[Taipei] during the second half of the year, and they reached 
common understandings in principle on relevant issues. ARATS 
representatives had the understanding and support from all walks 
of life in Taiwan during their consultative meeting held in 
Taiwan. With the new headway which the two associations have 
achieved in their liaison and cooperation, cross-Strait business 
consultations will continue. 
  After the talks between Wang Daohan and Gu Zhenfu, the 
Taiwan 
authorities have continued spreading the fallacy that "the talks 
demonstrate the roles of the two sides as equal political 
entities," and their endeavor of "developing international 
space" has also gone astray as indicated by their clamor to 
"return to the United Nations." However, because of the 
opposition of the international community and the Chinese people 
as a whole, their attempts to create "one country, two seats" 
and "two Chinas," were woefully defeated because they disregard 
the one China principle. In November, the official which the 
Taiwan authorities sent to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Conference in Seattle continued to slip on the way to create 
"two Chinas" by proposing the so-called "policy of two Chinas at 
the present stage," and his proposal was strongly criticized by 
media at home and abroad. 
  Taiwan will elect "county and city assemblymen" and 
"township 
and town magistrates" in January next year, and also the "Taiwan 
governor" and "mayors of Taibei and Gaoxiong [Kaohsiung]" at the 
end of the year. The new redistribution of political power in 
Taiwan will certainly give rise to even more fierce fights 
within the KMT and between the KMT and other political parties 
in Taiwan. In 1994, power struggle will still be the theme 
within Taiwan's political arena and the development of 
cross-Strait relations will continue to be the focus of 
attention inside and outside the island.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by staff Reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 </F>
1627): "Lu Ping Talks About Principle of Right of Abode, 
Stressing That Beijing Welcomes Return of Hong Kong Migrants"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--Lu Ping, director of 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said today the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), which adopts a welcoming 
attitude toward the influx of Hong Kong emigrants, is studying a 
flexible method to solve the problem of the permanent resident 
status of non-Chinese residents of Hong Kong. 
  At a friendship tea party today, Lu Ping told reporters that 
the above-mentioned principle had been clearly laid down by the 
relevant panel under the PWC. Although the method has yet to be 
finalized, he said that the panel is working hard to formulate a 
very flexible method which tallys with China's nationality law 
and which will enable most returnees to enjoy permanent right of 
abode in Hong Kong. 
  Lu Ping said: Even now, many Hong Kong residents have not 
been granted an identity card with "three stars" [denoting 
permanent resident status] on it although they have lived in 
Hong Kong for several decades. The Chinese side has repeatedly 
suggested to the British Hong Kong government that Hong Kong's 
existing migration regulations should be amended according to 
the Basic Law. 
  After listing several possible solutions to the problem, Lu 
Ping said: The suggestions raised so far are not well 
considered. For instance, some people suggested solving the 
problem on the basis of the place of residence. According to 
the common law, there are two types of residences. One is the 
original dwelling place, namely, the place where one's father 
lived and is considered one's permanent residence, the status of 
which will never become null and void; and the other is the 
selected place of residence, the status of which will become 
invalid. According to this principle, the status of the 
original place of residence will become null and void if the 
status of the selected place of residence is chosen, while the 
former will be restored if the latter is given up. Such a 
principle can only solve the problem concerning Chinese citizens 
born in Hong Kong as opposed to Chinese citizens who were not 
born in Hong Kong or who have resided in Hong Kong for seven 
years or more, or non-Chinese residents. 
  Lu Ping continued: Other people maintain that since Chinese 
citizens born in Hong Kong and Chinese citizens who have lived 
in Hong Kong for seven years have been given permanent resident 
status, and the Basic Law does not say that these people's 
identity cards will be invalid once they change their 
nationalities, the problem of whether or not these people should 
enjoy right of abode should be given consideration. Non-Chinese 
residents who have lived in Hong Kong for seven years will be 
required to express a desire to regard Hong Kong as their 
permanent place of residence before they are granted right of 
abode, but their right of abode will be forfeited if they leave 
Hong Kong for a long time because this shows that they do not 
treat Hong Kong as their permanent place of residence. The 
Basic Law does not set conditions under which right of abode 
will be forfeited, so the relevant problem must be placed on the 
agenda. He stressed: The foregoing solutions are tentative 
ones and remain immature. The issue is in fact not as serious 
as claimed by the British Hong Kong Government. Our approach is 
to explore a flexible solution which will not contravene China's 
nationality law and which will make the right of abode 
obtainable to most Hong Kong people returning to Hong Kong from 
abroad. When talking about Chinese citizens among Hong Kong 
residents, Lu Ping said: China's nationality law considers dual 
nationality illegal. According to the nationality law and the 
Chinese Government's consistent stand on the Hong Kong issue, 
those Hong Kong Chinese holding BDTC (British Dependent 
Territories Citizen) and BNO [British National Overseas] 
passports and those who have been given right of abode in the 
United Kingdom but do not settle there are all Chinese citizens. 
  Lu Ping also revealed today that the Hong Kong SAR (Special 
Administrative Region) passport is being designed. To make 
travel convenient for Hong Kong people after 1997, Lu Ping 
added, the Chinese side has asked the Hong Kong side to provide 
materials about Chinese citizens among Hong Kong residents so 
that SAR passports will be given to them before 1997. 
  When asked whether he had seen the design of the SAR 
passport, Lu Ping said he had. The design is similar to the PRC 
passport except for a bauhinia [the flower of Hong Kong] design 
on it. We are now designing the SAR passport; as soon as the 
passport is ready we will make representations to relevant 
countries through diplomatic channels over the matter. We will 
try our best to obtain mutual visa exemptions to make things 
convenient for Hong Kong travelers, said Lu Ping. He continued: 
The way to issue SAR passports to Hong Kong people before 1997 
and the technicalities of the SAR government discharging its 
responsibilities related to the passports issue is under 
discussion. For instance, some people have suggested issuing 
SAR passports to Hong Kong people through certain channels. But 
the passport will remain invalid until it is endorsed by the SAR 
government putting its stamp on it in 1997.

  [Text] China will begin seeking visa exemptions for 
Special Administrative Region (SAR) passports after a sample of 
the travel document has been prepared, according to senior 
official Lu Ping. 
  Mr Lu, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau 
Affairs Office said yesterday that China wanted to issue the SAR 
passports before the 1997 change-over. 
  "To achieve this, we need the co-operation of the British 
side in supplying information, and we are prepared to discuss 
this with them," said Mr Lu, shortly after expressing pessimism 
about Sino- British co-operation following the breakdown of 
talks on Hong Kong's political reforms. 
  Although Article 154 of the Basic Law restricts the issuing 
of the SAR passports to after the change-over, Mr Lu said the 
Chinese Government hoped the documents could be handed over to 
people before July 1, 1997. He said SAR residents could still 
use documents such as the Certificate of Identity for travelling 
after 1997, although that did not reflect their nationality. 
"It would not be appropriate if one could not hold a document 
indicating one's nationality in the SAR under the Chinese 
Government," he said. 
  The subject has been discussed by the social and security 
panel of the Preliminary Working Committee and Mr Lu said one 
way to prevent contravening the Basic Law would be for the 
passports to be officially chopped for use only after July 1, 
1997. 
  He refused to go into details of the design, but said the 
passport would have a bauhinia on the cover. 
  The senior official also gave another assurance that Hong 
Kong people with a second passport would be able to retain the 
right of abode in the territory.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Talks About Nationality Issue, </F>
Stressing That Special Cases Must Be Handled in Special Ways"] 
  [Text] In response to a reporter's question about the 
nationality of the members of the Preliminary Work Committee 
[PWC] yesterday, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch, said that while the National People's Congress 
[NPC] Standing Committee had decided to establish the PWC, there 
were no provisions restricting foreign passport holders becoming 
PWC members. The situation in Hong Kong is special. The 
legislature of the future special administrative region [SAR] 
will even include foreign passport holders, who will not exceed 
20 percent of the total number of members. 
  Deputy Director Zhang Junsheng yesterday attended a 
reception 
sponsored by WEN WEI PO for the issue of the album "Record of 
China's Hope Project." A reporter said that there were foreign 
passport holders among PWC members. Yes, Zhang responded, there 
are many foreign passport holders in Hong Kong, which is a 
special phenomenon. There are provisions in the Basic Law 
concerning this issue. In the NPC Standing Committee decision 
on forming the PWC, there were no provisions on what kind of 
passports its members should hold. Actually, foreign nationals 
are not allowed to be in the legislature of any country or 
region. But Hong Kong's situation is special and its future 
legislature may have foreign nationals, who will not exceed 20 
percent of the total number of members. 
  Zhang Junsheng continued: The Basic Law clearly stipulates 
that nationality and permanent residency are not the same thing. 
Foreigners who meet the requirements of the Basic Law may also 
become permanent Hong Kong residents. The provisions of the 
Basic Law should be followed, as they clearly state the rules 
concerning the matter. If there are no provisions in the Basic 
Law concerning concrete matters, they should be handled by 
adopting specific regulations. Prior to the promulgation of 
these regulations, deliberations may be extensively held. The 
question of Hong Kong residents' nationality is complicated, and 
this was considered while drafting the Basic Law, Zhang Junsheng 
stated. As some three and a half years are left until 1 July 
1997, a number of problems may be encountered after the 
establishment of the SAR government. Although some decisions 
will be made prior to this period, we still have time. 
  A reporter asked whether there will be restrictions on 
foreign nationals becoming members of the Preparatory Committee 
of the SAR government. Zhang replied that the committee has not 
been set up yet. You may offer suggestions, which may include 
whether there should be restrictions on foreign nationals.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Whom Should Contemporary Young </F>
Soldiers Worship?"] 
  [Text] A person's youth is the best time of his or her 
life, and is also a period of being full of illusion and eager 
to emulate some examples and worship some good idols. Our Army 
is always a place for the gathering of many young people. Being 
young soldiers determined to dedicate ourselves to national 
defense in modern times, whom should we worship? 
  Historical experience and current needs in reality all tell 
us: We should take the heroic figures who dedicated their whole 
lives to national independence, people's liberation, and social 
progress as our examples, and should let these heroic figures 
firmly occupy the "star position" in our minds. 
  The heroic figures of our party and our Army are outstanding 
representatives of the masses in their hundreds of millions 
emerging in the prolonged practice of revolution and 
construction. Some of them are national heroes who have made 
immortal contributions to national liberation and independence, 
and they include such proletarian revolutionaries of the older 
generation as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and 
Deng Xiaoping; some of them are revolutionary martyrs with iron 
will power, such as Yang Jingyu, Fang Zhimin, Ye Ting, and Jiang 
Zhujun, who were determined to shed their blood for the cause of 
the party and sacrifice their lives to show their loyalty to the 
party; some of them are combat heroes such as Dong Cunrui, Huang 
Jiguang, Yang Zirong, and Yang Yucai, who fought bravely and 
defeated the enemies with a fearless spirit; some of them are 
communist fighters such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, and 
Su Ning, who served the people wholeheartedly in the peaceful 
environment and dedicated themselves to the service of their 
country through diligent work; some of them are pioneers on the 
front of scientific research such as Qian Xuesen, Deng Jiaxian, 
and Qian Shaojun, who created miracles again and again in 
scaling the heights of modern national defense science and 
technology in their hard work over the past decades; some of 
them are physically disabled people who have healthy minds and 
make great contributions to the party's cause, such as Wu 
Yunduo, Shi Guangzhu, and Li Zhijun; and others are innumerous 
unknown heroes who never claim credit for their meritorious 
services, such as "living martyrs" Li Yuan, Jiang Yuduo, and Cao 
Faqing. The mentality, character, and will of these heroic 
figures give expression to the supreme realm of thought that 
communists should attain, and also represent the lofty virtues 
of the revolutionary soldiers. We can say that every hero is a 
banner. To study, live, work, and fight as the heroes did, we 
shall be able to establish the proletarian world outlook as soon 
as possible, realize the value of revolutionary life to the 
maximum, stand all tests in the course of reform, opening, and 
developing the socialist market economy, and always preserve our 
revolutionary youth. 
  Emulating the heroes, creating heroic deeds, and taking the 
path of a hero is always the glorious tradition of this Army. 
In both wartime and peacetime, as soon as millions of young 
people join this Army, they begin to really worship and emulate 
the heroic figures, although some of them have just begun to 
understand the theory of revolution; their mentality also begins 
to rise to a lofty realm, and their behavior also becomes great. 
The course of many heroes' growth in this Army shows that they 
first worship heroes, then emulate heroes and also strive to 
become heroes themselves. Young people are undergoing the 
process of forming their world outlook, and their minds are 
rather malleable. In light of this characteristic of young 
people, we should guide young soldiers to admire heroic figures, 
continuously adjust their life orientation, and take the 
initiative in emulating the examples. This is a necessary 
condition and the most effective way to cultivate more heroes. 
For various reasons, the values cherished by young people are 
now becoming more diverse. In such circumstances, we should 
draw the attention of young officers and servicemen to 
worshiping and emulating heroes, and should encourage them to 
become heroes themselves. This will certainly play a 
significant role in prompting them to become soldiers with a 
lofty ideal of revolution, with lofty morals, good education, 
and a strong sense of discipline as soon as possible. 
  Serving the people wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of 
this 
Army. Our soldiers are required to be ready to shed their blood 
and sacrifice their lives to fulfill their sacred mission, and 
this characteristic of the armed forces also requires us to 
worship heroes. In the years of war, no matter how busy the 
troops were in combat, production, and mass work, they continued 
to carry out the activity of emulating heroes and striving to 
become heroes. This is always an important part of this Army's 
political work. Under the new historical conditions, this Army 
is striving to realize the general goal of revolutionalization, 
modernization, and regularization, and to fulfill the sacred 
mission of providing security guarantees for reform, opening, 
and socialist modernization. We should still vigorously carry 
forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism, continue to carry 
forward the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping and the 64-character pioneering spirit advocated 
by Chairman Jiang. This should become a strong mental pillar 
for promoting this Army's comprehensive development. Therefore, 
admiring and emulating heroic figures and creating heroic deeds 
should become common conduct of contemporary revolutionary 
soldiers. 
  This Army is the candle of innumerous heroes. In order to 
bring about more heroic figures under the new situation, leaders 
and political organs at all levels should fully use various 
effective educational forms, such as reading books, giving 
lectures, holding singing parties, arranging glory rooms, seeing 
good films, and listening to old comrades's talk about the 
tradition, to give wide publicity to the heroic figures in 
various periods and on various fronts so that our cadres and 
soldiers will always live in the atmosphere of revolutionary 
heroism, and more brilliant stars will rise to make the life in 
the barracks more vigorous.

6007 3123)] 
  [Excerpts] Lanzhou, 10 Jan (XINHUA) -- Thanks to the 
painstaking efforts of the residents, an air force guided 
missile testing base in northwest China, which is named "the 
Cradle of Miracle Arrows," has been turned into a 
surface-to-air-missile city, with trees lining the streets, the 
air filled with the aroma of ripening fruits, and complete 
facilities for daily life. 
  The base is located in the Great Badain Jaran Desert. More 
than 60 grass-roots units are scattered along the 22 small 
settlements in the 4,870 square km desert. People call the base 
"the isolated islet" because of its extremely difficult living 
conditions. [passage omitted on efforts to improve the living 
conditions] 
  More than 500 college graduates have been assigned to the 
base in recent years. Some 85 percent of them have become 
professional technical backbone elements, over 90 percent have 
performed meritorious service, and nearly 100 of them have been 
rated as outstanding intellectuals or outstanding scientific and 
technological cadres. In scientific research and experiment, 
the base has set the highest records in the number of guided 
missiles launched on a single day, in a single month, and in a 
single year. It is also the first base in China to successfully 
complete a multi-targeting, minimum-altitude missile launching. 
It accomplished more than 100 scientific research and 
experimental tasks with flying colors. Six of the scientific 
research projects filled in the gaps in China's scientific and 
technological field, and dozens of research results received 
state or military science and technology progress awards.

"Further Enhance the Party's Leadership Over the Armed Forces 
Work"] 
  [Text] Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party 
committee and first secretary of the party committee under the 
provincial military district, delivered a speech at a meeting 
held on 19 December. She held it with the participation of first 
secretaries from the party committee of various military 
subdistricts across the province and responsible persons from 
the armed forces committees at all levels. In his speech Sun 
Weiben stressed: Party committees at all levels, particularly 
the first secretary of military subdistrict party committees, 
should foster, under the new situation, the concept of 
enhancing the party's control over the armed forces and never 
weakening the party's control in this regard. They should also 
concentrate on the concept of achieving harmonious development 
between the construction of national defense reserve forces and 
economic construction. The construction of militia and reserve 
forces should be put on the daily schedule of local party 
committees as well as into the overall construction plan at the 
prefecture-city level and into the system in which the first 
secretary holds responsibility for the construction in this 
regard during his tenure. Party committees at all levels should 
ensure the assignment of various duties of the armed forces work 
to responsible personnel and exercise strong leadership over the 
work. 
  Attending the meeting were leading personnel from the party, 
government, and Army organs, including Shao Qihui, Tian 
Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, Chen Yunlin, Yu Jingchang, and Wang 
Guiqin. 
  Party committees at all levels throughout the province and 
armed forces departments have enhanced the party's leadership 
over the armed forces in the past two years. They have done this 
by closely following the center of economic construction. Thus, 
the province's construction of national defense reserve forces 
has developed overall and the sense of national defense for the 
broad masses of cadres and the personnel of militia and reserve 
forces has been obviously improved. The armed forces units at 
grass-roots levels have remained stable thanks to conducting 
reforms among the systems. The construction of leading bodies 
for the people's armed forces departments and that of cadres' 
contingents have been strengthened. The average age of cadres 
in charge of the armed forces work has shown a four-year 
decrease over the past and their structure of specialized 
knowledge has been greater improved. The organizational 
construction of militia and reserve forces among key localities 
has been further implemented. The quality of military training 
and administrative work undertaken by the militia and reserve 
forces throughout the province has been upgraded. 90 percent of 
counties, county-level cities, and districts have realized their 
training of reserve forces in their neighboring military bases. 
The qualified rate of trainees has reached more than 98 
percent. Meanwhile, various localities have upheld the 
principle of using the armed forces and training armed forces in 
the course of reform and construction and having the personnel 
of militia and reserve forces play an important role in building 
the two civilizations. Since the campaign of "scientific and 
technological winter", one million personnel of militia and 
reserve forces throughout the province have attended the 
training classes on technologies suitable to rural areas. These 
classes have turned out 200,000 graduates, talented personnel 
who have done a lot in developing the commodity economy in rural 
areas. During the campaign of "supporting the poor and helping 
the difficult", 70 percent of poor households under the support 
and assistance of militiamen, and farms run by the people's 
liberation army units stationed in the province, have dealt with 
the problems of dressing warmly and eating their well. 32 
percent of them have gotten on the road to riches. Various 
localities have the militia and reserve forces in the activities 
of combating floods and dealing with emergencies, taming large 
rivers, building water conservancy works, and fulfilling tasks 
for building the state key projects in the province. These 
localities have also pioneered a new road: Integrating the 
development of productive forces with the upgrade of fighting 
capability. While safeguarding social peace, the personnel of 
militia and reserve forces across the province coordinated with 
the public security departments in cracking down on 213 serious 
and appalling criminal cases and capturing 4,365 criminal 
elements this year. 
  In his speech Sun Weiben also emphatically pointed out: 
Efforts should be made to enhance the party's control over the 
armed forces and to have the first secretary assume the 
important responsibility in the work. A good job must be done 
in carrying out political construction among the militia and 
reserve forces and persistently applying the socialist theory of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to arm the minds of these armed forces. 
Efforts should be made to have education on missions, and fine 
tradition among the personnel of militia and reserve forces; to 
maintain the correct work orientation of militia and reserve 
forces; and to ensure that these forces are always under the 
absolute leadership of the party. Meanwhile, party committees 
at all levels, in particular the first secretary, should 
continuously enhance their self study; go deep into reality in 
order to carry out investigation and study; explore the 
characteristics and laws of the armed forces under the new 
situation. Attention should be paid to the role of the armed 
forces departments in being a "staff organ", being good at 
coordinating with departments concerned, to commonly and jointly 
managing, persistently implementing the regulations and systems 
that have been proven effective in enforcement, and 
realistically upgrading the capability and level of leadership 
over the armed forces work. 
  During the meeting Yu Jingchang, member of the provincial 
party standing committee and political commissar of the 
provincial military district, delivered a report entitled "By 
Meeting the New Situation of `Two Changes', We Should Improve 
the Quality of the Province's Work in Building Militia and 
Reserve Forces to a New Level".

  [Text] The social and legal committee of the provincial 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] recently pointed out some problems and put 
forward suggestions after investigating the Tongchuan Mining 
Office, which attracted close attention from Vice Premier Zou 
Jiahua and relevant state ministries and commissions. 
  According to the investigation, since the beginning of this 
year, the Tongchuan Mining Office's coal production has shown a 
significant downward curve and its deficit dramatically 
increased, which has seriously undermined the production of 
coal, circulation of funds, worker livelihood, and the stability 
of the mines. 
  In view of the existing problems, provincial CPPCC committee 
members put forward a six-point suggestion. Vice Premier Zou 
Jiahua, upon reading the investigation report of the Shaanxi 
provincial CPPCC committee, which had been transmitted to him by 
a relevant department on 27 October, commented: These 
suggestions are very good. They should be really looked into. 
I hope the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Railways, 
the Ministry of Labor, and relevant financial and banking units 
will form a work team, to be led by the Ministry of Coal 
Industry, to join hands with the Shanxi government in helping 
Tongchuan solve the problem. The same principle should apply: 
Reducing workers, enhancing efficiency, recognizing clearly who 
the users are, and organizing transportation. 
  According to Comrade Zou Jiahua's comments, the State 
Council 
work team, the provincial economic and trade commission, the

<F P=106> [Article by Wu Yi, MOFTEC Party Group Secretary and </F>
Minister: "Study Mao Zedong Thought and Open Up Future for 
Foreign Economy and Trade Work"] 
  [Text] Today is the centenary of Comrade Mao Zedong's 
birth. As greatly excited as other cadres, staff members, and 
workers throughout the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation [MOFTEC], I cherish the memory of Mao Zedong, the 
great man with outstanding achievements. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist. He was the chief 
founder of our party, Army, and state, and the great leader of 
the Chinese people of all nationalities. He has held an 
everlasting important position in contemporary history as well 
as in the history of the development of Marxism and socialism. 
He creatively combined the fundamental tenets of Marxism with 
concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, pooled the 
experience and wisdom of our party, and formed Mao Zedong 
Thought. His erudite and profound theoretical thinking is a 
spiritual treasure house that is inexhaustible for our study and 
application. The great achievements of Comrade Mao Zedong are 
comprehensive. Through protracted and extreme hardships and 
difficulties, he led the Chinese people in overthrowing the 
three big mountains, founding New China, and subsequently 
engaging in various facets of construction. As a great 
strategist in foreign affairs, he conducted substantial 
pioneering work for, and made tremendous contributions to, the 
establishment of China's foreign strategy and the formulation of 
foreign policies. He also performed immortal deeds in the 
establishment of China's foreign economic and trade system and 
the formulation of the principles and policies of foreign 
economy and trade, which has been part and parcel of the foreign 
work. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong always took the country's undertaking in 
foreign trade and economic cooperation very seriously. As early 
as the time when the CPC was setting up revolutionary bases and 
liberated areas before the founding of the republic, Comrade Mao 
Zedong proposed that decisionmaking power in foreign trade 
should be in the hands of the people, which should be taken as 
an objective of China's new democratic revolution. For this 
purpose, practice in pioneering the cause should be carried out. 
At a preparatory meeting of the new Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference held on the eve of New China's birth, 
Comrade Mao Zedong proclaimed: "The Chinese people are willing 
to have friendly cooperation with the people of various 
countries in the world, and resume and develop business contacts 
with them to facilitate the growth of production and bring about 
a prosperous economy." After the PRC was founded, Comrade Mao 
Zedong took hold of the overall situation and enthusiastically 
showed concern for China's foreign economic and trade 
undertaking, regarding the positive development of foreign 
economic cooperation and trade relations, to be based on 
independence and self-reliance under the principle of equality 
and mutual benefit, as a guiding ideology of economic and trade 
exchange between China and the world. He presided over relevant 
meetings several times to keep abreast of the foreign economic 
and trade work and to examine and approve major steps for the 
establishment and development of New China's socialist cause in 
the area of foreign economy and trade as well as the basic 
principles and policies of relevant work. Also, he repeatedly 
pointed out the necessity of relying mainly on the domestic 
market while making the foreign market subsidiary, but stressing 
the importance of developing the latter. Its significance must 
not be underestimated, nor must the efforts to develop this 
market be slackened. It was his consistent view of doing 
business, both with the socialist and people's democratic 
countries and the capitalist countries. When he met with 
leaders and delegations who came to visit China or when he 
personally visited commodity fairs, he would instruct foreign 
trade workers to conduct wide-ranging exchanges at home and 
abroad, open up the international market, expand exports, and 
ensure product quality, with a view to rapidly developing and 
expanding China's national economy. 
  With a view to furthering friendly relations between China 
and the world, Comrade Mao Zedong, in the spirit of patriotism 
and internationalism, stressed the need to vigorously conduct 
economic cooperation and trade with foreign countries to serve 
China's foreign work and socialist construction. Guided by his 
brilliant thought, foreign economic and trade work has become a 
bridge promoting friendly contacts between the Chinese people 
and the people of various countries, which has given impetus to 
developing China's cooperation with the international community. 
  Thanks to Comrade Mao Zedong's concern, the foreign economic 
and trade system of New China deliberately took shape in a 
relatively short period of time, which has played an important 
role in socialist modernization, and which has held a certain 
position in international economic relations and trade as well. 
Such momentous achievements have opened vast vistas for the 
development of China's foreign economic and trade undertaking. 
  Today, the purpose of reviewing Comrade Mao Zedong's 
immortal feats for China's revolution and construction, his 
tremendous contributions to the liberation of the oppressed 
peoples and the cause of human progress, and his concern for 
foreign economic and trade undertaking lies in cherishing memory 
of Comrade Mao Zedong, in expressing our feeling of respects for 
him and, more importantly, in emulating Comrade Mao Zedong's 
brilliant thought of developing foreign economic and trade 
undertaking under the new historical condition, in a bid to open 
up the future of the foreign economic and trade undertaking 
under the constant guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping has inherited and developed Mao Zedong 
Thought by integrating Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought with 
practice in contemporary China and the characteristics of the 
age. He put forth a complete set of theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is the valuable 
wealth of the CPC and the Chinese people. At present, we should 
develop the style of study of integrating theory with practice, 
conscientiously study Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, systematically master the spirit and essence of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, arm the minds of party members, cadres, 
staff, and workers of our ministry with this theory, and more 
consciously apply the Marxist stand, views, and methods in 
studying and resolving new problems. It is particularly 
necessary to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics as the theoretical base 
and guiding principle for doing our foreign economic and trade 
work, and to seriously study and solve the major practical and 
theoretical problems urgently awaiting a solution in the course 
of the in-depth foreign economic and trade structural reform to 
wrest new victory in the cause of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and in the foreign economic and trade 
undertakings. 
  Today, in recalling Comrade Mao Zedong, we should take the 
great achievements and ideological examples of Comrade Mao 
Zedong and other proletarian revolutionaries of the older 
generation as well as the concern and expectations of Comrade 
Mao Zedong for foreign economic and trade work as an enormous 
spiritual strength that constantly inspires us in our victorious 
advances. Under the leadership of the party's Central Committee 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, let all party members, cadres, staff, and 
workers throughout MOFTEC steadfastly persist in the party's 
basic line, unite as one, forge ahead, and work in a solid 
manner, to prove ourselves to be worthy of the concern shown by 
Comrade Mao Zedong and other proletarian revolutionaries of the 
older generation for our foreign economic and trade work, to 
achieve the magnificent objective of the in-depth foreign 
economic and trade structural reform sketched by the 14th 
National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, and to strive to fulfill various 
missions set forth by the party and state for foreign economic 
and trade work!

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 12 (AFP)--China's top tax official 
took pains Wednesday to reassure foreign investors concerned 
that sweeping fiscal reforms implemented this year will increase 
their tax burden. 
  The most dramatic changes in China's tax system since 1949 
were implemented January 1, and there has been confusion over 
the implications of the reforms, principally aimed at boosting 
central government revenue. 
  Foreign firms are mainly concerned with the fate of the 
preferential corporate-tax rates they have enjoyed as a result 
of China's push to attract foreign investment in recent years. 
  "The preferential treatment already extended to foreign 
investors in terms of their corporate income tax will remain 
unchanged," state administration of taxation director Jin Xin 
told a news conference here. The preferential 15 percent 
income-tax rate is for foreign-funded firms operating in China's 
special economic zones, coastal economic and technological 
development areas and Shanghai's special Pudong industrial zone. 
  The new tax reforms abolish the old unified industrial and 
commercial tax on sales, replacing it with a unified 
corporate-tax rate of 33 percent. A new value-added tax (VAT) 
of 17 percent on most products has also gone into effect. Luxury 
goods, such as tobacco, alcohol and cars, now carry a stiff 45 
percent excise tax in addition to the VAT. 
  While the reforms will inevitably bring some changes to the 
tax bills of foreign-invested enterprises, Jin said, he stressed 
that they primarily involved a restructuring of the taxation 
system rather than a blanket tax hike. "The majority of 
foreign-funded enterprises will have a similar tax burden before 
and after the current reform," he said. 
  Jin also outlined a special policy for refunds to foreign 
firms whose tax payments increased as a result of the changes. 
While the new taxes are still being levied, any resulting 
additional tax burden will be refunded for the duration of those 
firms' existing contracts over a maximum period of five years, 
Jin said. However, within those five years--or until their 
contract expires--"they have to transform their operational 
mechanisms, improve their economic efficiency and create 
conditions so as to compete with domestic enterprises" at the 
same tax rate, Jin said. The special policy will only apply to 
foreign-investment projects approved before January 1. 
  Jin admitted that during the transitional five-year period, 
foreign-funded firms that set up in China before and after 
January 1 would operate on a different tax scale, but added that 
it was normal for a dividing line to be drawn somewhere. 
  Jin also said there were no immediate plans to introduce 
production-related reductions in the amount of VAT paid by 
foreign firms purchasing equipment in China. Some foreign 
companies have expressed concern that the proposed system makes 
no provisions for reducing VAT payments in the long term as 
exist in other countries. However, Jin added that such 
provisions could be introduced at a later stage if they proved 
reasonable and feasible.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Plan Puts the Private Sector on Fast </F>
Track"] 
  [Text] China will actively encourage private business as 
part of the nation's effort to build a comprehensive market this 
year, a senior official said yesterday. 
  Private enterprise needs to be developed faster, especially 
in the service sector, said Liu Minxue, head of the State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), the country's 
top business watchdog. 
  Liu told a national conference in Beijing yesterday that 
governments at all levels should encourage cooperation between 
the private businesses and other economic sectors to create a 
mixed economy. 
  The State had a policy of encouraging private enterprise in 
all kinds of areas -- except key national economic sectors and 
industries like defence, Liu said. 
  A strong private sector is one of the preconditions of fair 
market competition, he said, adding that local governments 
should consider it part of the country's economic structure and 
work hard to develop it as a principal component of an 
integrated socialist market. 
  Encouraging the private sector is part of the State's plan 
to 
develop a sound market system based on the new laws against 
unfair competition and on consumers' rights. 
  SAIC reports say the private sector is becoming more and 
more 
important to local economies in both the better-developed 
coastal regions and some poor inland areas. 
  Twenty-eight provinces, autonomous regions and 
municipalities 
have issued local measures and policies to promote private 
business. 
  As a result, the country had 16 million private businessmen 
and women by the end of September, 11.7 percent more than 12 
months before. There were 210,000 private enterprises, 73 
percent more than the previous year, Liu said. 
  Last year's tax payment from private businesses and 
enterprises was expected to be 25 billion yuan ($2.87 billion), 
according to the State Tax Administration. 
  Meanwhile, Liu said at the conference that China will do 
more 
to ensure fair competition among enterprises. 
  The measures are expected to come out soon following the 
introduction nationwide of a new business registration system, a 
move considered very important to the growth of the market 
economy. 
  The new registration system aims to give enterprises the 
chance to make their own decisions and make them responsible for 
profits and losses, said Liu. 
  He said the reform means less direct government control, 
except in key State enterprises. 
  Most enterprises will now sign on directly at registration 
departments instead of first getting approval from government 
departments as before, he said. 
  Liu also pledged to enlarge the scope of registration to 
include businesses run by universities and research centres. 
  By the end of last September, the number of registered 
businesses in China was 7.113 million, 22 percent more than nine 
months before, Liu said.

"Thoughts on `Zhili' Tragedy"] 
  [Text] A disastrous fire which broke out in Shenzhen Zhili 
Toy Factory on 19 November led to a tragedy: The factory 
suffered heavy casualties, including 83 workers dead. This is 
the highest fire death toll Guangdong Province has ever 
experienced since the beginning of reform and opening up, and 
also a disaster rarely seen in the whole country. 
Investigations have showed clearly that this is a major 
accident due to negligence, and both the foreign investors and 
the managerial staff of the Chinese side have unshirkable 
responsibility for the tragedy. 
  Though there are only a small number of foreign-invested 
factories which, like Zhili, give no thought to the safety of 
workers, yet it has been learned that some foreign-invested 
enterprises, especially those operating on a small-scale, have 
been found to have various problems with labor protection, and 
they often infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of 
workers. For instance, the lack of labor safety devices in 
these enterprises has led to many industrial accidents, and the 
adverse labor environment has done great harm to the workers' 
health. In addition, many enterprises arbitrarily lengthen 
working hours and make most of their workers work extra shifts 
or hours; some arbitrarily reduce or embezzle part of workers' 
wages, and reduce or even cancel insurance and welfare 
allowances which should be extended to workers; while others 
punish and dismiss workers at will, and even exercise physical 
punishment, make body searches, and place their workers in 
confinement. All these will, undoubtedly, result in the 
resentment of workers and staff working in these enterprises, 
and trigger off a number of labor disputes. People in all walks 
of life also find things in these enterprises totally 
intolerable. 
  The whole world has noticed that China is currently carrying 
out the principle of reform and opening up, and will go on with 
the principle for a long period of time to come. China opens 
its door wide to businessmen coming from outside the country. 
We extend warm welcome to foreign businessmen who make 
investments and run enterprises on the mainland, treat them with 
due respect, and try our best to make things convenient for 
them. Their wish to make money is tenable. Yet one thing they 
must bear in mind is that they must abide by Chinese laws, which 
includes rules and regulations on production safety and labor 
protection. China is a socialist country, and workers are 
masters of our country. By the same token, Chinese workers and 
staff working in foreign-invested enterprises are also masters 
of our country, and their political and economic rights and 
interests are protected by the Chinese Constitution and law. It 
is true that a small number of our workers did violate labor 
discipline, and some engaged themselves in little pilfering. 
What should we do with these people? We can cope with them in 
accordance with factory regulations, conduct criticism and 
education, hand down appropriate punishment, and even take their 
names off the books. However, no enterprise can set its 
regulations against Chinese law; and beating and cursing of 
workers at will, body searches, confinement, encroachment on 
personal freedom, and damage to personal dignity are not allowed 
by the law. 
  Some foreign businessmen know very little about Chinese law. 
They believe that since the workers are hired hands, the boss 
and managerial executives of an enterprise can do anything they 
want to the workers. This is an extremely incorrect concept. 
Local governments and trade unions (if they have already been 
set up) of these enterprises should help foreign investors get 
familiar with relevant Chinese legal regulations, supervise 
implementation of these regulations, request amendments to any 
factory regulations that proves contrary to Chinese law, and ask 
for improvements to deficient conditions stipulated in labor 
contracts. While protecting the legitimate operation of foreign 
investors, we also need to safeguard the legitimate rights and 
interests of our workers. On this issue, we should firmly speak 
what we must say, and stand firm on matters of principle. What 
we do will not scare away foreign investors; on the contrary, 
the number of labor disputes and various accidents can only be 
reduced when people stand firm on matters of principle and act 
in accordance with the law. Only by so doing can we base our 
cooperation with foreign businessmen on a solid foundation so 
that the cooperation can grow in a healthy way. 
  Wise foreign businessmen also understand this point. Not 
long ago, two Japanese guests staying in the Shanghai Nikko 
Longbai Hotel suffered loss by theft. Two Chinese female 
workers working in the hotel came under suspicion of the hotel's 
Japanese managerial staff, who instigated others to conduct an 
illegal nude body search on the two female workers. Workers and 
staff of the hotel expressed their strong indignation, and urged 
relevant sources to handle such encroachments on personal rights 
in accordance with the law. In the end, the Japanese side dealt 
with the matter sternly: Among the three managerial staff 
involved, one was recalled back to his country, while the other 
two were punished by serious warnings and a six-month period of 
salary reduction; the general manager of the hotel was also 
given punishment of serious warning and a 10-month period of 
salary reduction. In addition, the hotel made an apology to the 
two victimized Chinese female workers and offered them financial 
compensation. In this way, the labor dispute was settled in a 
fairly satisfying manner. The way Nikko treats the mistakes 
made by their subordinates is worth using for reference by other 
foreign businessmen.

<F P=106> [By Hsu Yun-teng (1776 0061 7506): "People's Bank of China </F>
Specially Permits Continued Circulation of Hong Kong Currency in 
Shenzhen and Zhuhai"] 
  [Text] When interviewed by this reporter by telephone 
yesterday, an authoritative senior official of the People's Bank 
of China [PBOC] pointed out: A compromise has been made between 
the group of officials who advocate banning the circulation of 
Hong Kong currency in Shenzhen and Zhuhai and another group of 
officials who advocate allowing its circulation there. The two 
groups have agreed that "for a period of time to come, the PBOC 
will specially allow Hong Kong currency to circulate and be used 
in the areas of Shenzhen and Zhuhai." 
  As for how many months or years that "period of time to 
come" 
means, he said: There is no specific timetable, which may be a 
very short period, or a very long one. 
  He commented further, saying: The Bank of China Hong Kong 
Branch will soon participate in the issuance of Hong Kong 
currency. After Hong Kong is returned to Mainland China in 
1997, Hong Kong currency will not be treated as foreign 
currency. This does not conflict with the existing prohibition. 
  He anticipated that Hong Kong currency will probably be 
circulated and used in Shenzhen and Zhuhai for a considerably 
long time in order to facilitate the operations of people and 
enterprises there. 
  He said: "In fact, it is unfeasible to ban the circulation 
of Hong Kong currency in Shenzhen and Zhuhai. Such being the 
case, it is unnecessary to insist on banning the currency there." 
  Qin Chijiang, a director of the Financial Research Institute 
of the PBOC, also confirmed the correctness of the above remarks 
and the consensus reached within the PBOC. 
  The news gives evidence to an exclusive report by this 
newspaper, which revealed a few days ago that the Shenzhen 
Branch of the PBOC had insisted that such a ban was unfeasible, 
and that it would "omit" concrete measures for carrying out the 
ban in its report for submission to its Beijing head office. 
  In addition, this newspaper also exclusively disclosed that 
Yin Jieyan, director of the State Administration of Exchange 
Control, had secretly visited Shenzhen a couple of days ago, 
and, after his return to Beijing, tried to persuade policymakers 
at the PBOC not to forcibly ban the circulation of Hong Kong 
currency in the areas of Shenzhen and Zhuhai.

  [Text] Beijing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- China's insurance 
business continued to develop at a high speed in 1993. 
  The People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which holds 
a 
monopoly over 98 percent of the country's insurance business, 
reported an overall income of 49.8 billion yuan, up 36.1 percent 
over the previous year. 
  More than 26.1 billion yuan of the total income was yielded 
from insurance premium income, and the pension fund income was 
23.6 billion yuan, rising by 32.3 and 38.8 percent respectively 
over the previous year. 
  According to Dai Fengju, vice-general manager of PICC, about 
700,000 enterprises applied for enterprise property insurance, 
while 350 million persons have become insured. 
  Moreover, 100 million-plus households have bid for family 
property insurance. A special planting insurance has covered 30 
million hectares. 
  Dai declared that PICC claims and pension payments reached 
27.1 billion yuan last year. Payment from domestic property 
insurance was 16.3 billion yuan, with personal insurance at 8.6 
billion yuan and foreign affairs-related insurances at over 2.1 
billion yuan. 
  PICC also established overseas companies in Hong Kong and 
Britain, namely the China Insurance Hong Kong (Group) Company 
and the China Insurance U.K. Holdings Company. So far PICC has 
opened 115,000 agencies throughout the country. 
  Dai explained that in this year, PICC will mainly contribute 
efforts to developing some major insurance policies. 
  For domestic property insurance, PICC will emphasize 
developing of insurance for enterprise property, cargo 
transportation and product liability. 
  Foreign-related insurance business, such as non-marine 
insurance and aviation personal insurance, will still be a focal 
point of development. 
  Others will include agricultural insurance on some 
commercial, foreign exchange-earning and hi-tech projects, and 
all kinds of pension insurance, health insurance and short-term 
personal insurance. 
  Dai also pledged that aiming to meet the demands of entering 
the international insurance market and developing China's 
commercial insurance, PICC has decided to carry out a trial 
operation of subsidiary companies. 
  A re-insurance system has been set up in PICC which ordered 
branch companies to shift 20 percent of their domestic insurance 
business to the general company. Moreover, branch companies are 
asked to sign excess insurance contracts with the general 
company, which demands that the two conduct domestic non-life 
insurance together. 
  Dai said that besides these measures, PICC will separate 
management on policy-based insurance business, which focuses on 
export-credit insurance and agricultural insurance, from 
commercial insurance items.

During the Transition to a Market Economy"] 
  [Text] The remarks made by Deng Xiaoping during his 
inspection tour of South China in early 1992 marked a turning 
point in China's entry into another historical period of 
accelerated reform, opening up, and economic construction. The 
investment structure, which is the important driving force and 
core of the cause of reform and development, and reform of this 
structure, have again become a matter of great concern to senior 
Chinese leaders and basic-level enterprises alike. On the basis 
of carefully analyzing the course of history and the lessons of 
reform of the investment structure over the past 14 years, we 
should search for a general model for the reform of China's 
investment structure in the light of the overall objective of 
the reform to establish a socialist market economy system, and 
we should work out short-term reform measures for realizing this 
target model. This has become our pressing task in promoting 
reform of the economic system as a whole. 
<H3>  I. A Basic Appraisal of Reform of the Investment Structure 
Over the Past 14 Years </H3>
  In China, the term investment structure generally refers to 
the operating mechanism and management system for activities in 
fixed- assets investment. It mainly covers the activities of 
investment entities, fund-raising methods, the ways in which 
investment is employed, the process by which projects are 
decided upon, the management of construction programs, and the 
macroregulation and control system. China's investment 
structure is basically one which has gradually developed in the 
wake of large-scale economic construction shortly after the 
founding of the People's Republic, and constitutes the integral 
core of the traditional planned economy structure. The 
experimental reform introduced in 1979 to replace government 
allocation by bank loans for investment in capital construction 
heralded the reform of the investment structure. Reforms carried 
out in this connection in the 14 years since then have produced 
a new investment structure: 
  First, the opening of multiple channels of investment in 
diverse economic sectors has put to an end to the singular 
channel of investment under the traditional structure, where 
units owned by the whole people were mainly dependent on state 
financial administrations, and this has greatly aroused the 
enthusiasm of all quarters to invest in construction projects. 
This plays an important role in the extensive and rapid raising 
of nearly 500 million yuan of investment in the past 14 years. 
[figure as published] By the end of 1992, the investment share 
of state-owned units had dropped to 65 percent of the total from 
95 percent in 1978. Of this, the financial investment weighting 
(which forms a part of the state capital construction fund) 
dropped from 80 percent to 11 percent. Investment raised by 
local governments, departments, and enterprises accounted for 41 
percent of the total. Bank loans and foreign investment, which 
account for 22 percent and 11 percent respectively, have become 
a major source of funds for the reproduction of fixed assets and 
laid the foundation for the establishment of a new investment 
and financing structure. 
  Second, a management model where multiple investment 
entities 
coexist and where each level exercises decisionmaking power has 
taken shape. The situation of the central government being the 
sole investment entity has been completely smashed. Local 
governments and departments, particularly state-owned 
enterprises and nonstate collective enterprises, township 
enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, enterprise groups, 
individuals within the country and foreign investors, have 
become important direct investment entities. This has promoted 
changes in the system by which projects are decided upon, 
examined, and approved, and this has prompted the central 
government to raise ceilings for projects submitted for 
examination and approval and to simply examination and approval 
procedures. However, reform in this respect is lagging behind 
the new development of multiple investment entities. 
  Third, the compensated use of state investment, the 
investment responsibility system, and the method of treating 
government investment as a commercial undertaking have been 
experimented with. In a sense, the "replacement of financial 
appropriations by loans," the investment responsibility system 
introduced in the early stages of reform, and the project 
proprietor responsibility system introduced in 1992, are all to 
solve the problem under the traditional structure where everyone 
ate from the "big pot" of government investment and for 
improving returns on government investment. In terms of actual 
results, it is not entirely due to the drawbacks of these reform 
measures that the original intentions of these reforms have not 
been fully realized. Rather, it is mainly because the investment 
responsibility system lacks the necessary foundation and exists 
in name only. This is one of the greatest weaknesses of reform 
of the investment structure over the past 14 years. 
  Fourth, in respect of project decisions and consultations, 
feasibility studies, design, construction, and material supplies 
management, a series of reform measures with the market 
competition mechanism at the core have been introduced to reform 
the assessment, bidding, and contracting of projects and to 
establish a raw materials market. Reforms in these areas have 
probably been the boldest and most effective in the reform of 
the traditional investment structure. Of course, because the 
market system is still not fully developed on the whole and 
enterprises have not completely cut off their ties of 
administrative subordination, it is still very difficult to 
bring market mechanisms into play in place of construction 
investment. 
  Fifth, attempts have been made to improve macroregulation 
and 
control of investment by economic means and indirect management. 
The two major pillars of the traditional investment structure, 
namely the mandatory investment planning system and the 
administrative system for the examination and approval of 
projects, have come under fierce attack during 14 years of 
reform. Some reforms have been introduced, whether actively or 
passively, consciously or unconsciously. These reforms, 
including the narrowing of the scope of mandatory planning, the 
introduction of guidance planning, the implementation of state 
industrial policy, the levying of energy and transport fund 
contributions and construction tax (later replaced by investment 
orientation tax), and the application of differential interest 
rates, "new charges for electricity generated by new plants," 
and other economic levers to regulate the flow of investment, 
have produced some concrete results. However, in spite of these 
efforts, the two major pillars of the traditional investment 
structure still have not been fundamentally removed and a new 
system of macroregulation and control has yet to take shape. 
This is another great weakness in the reform of the investment 
structure over the past 14 years. 
  Looking back at the reform of the investment structure in 
the 
past 14 years, our first conclusion is: As far as the total 
abolition of the traditional model of investment structure and 
the eventual establishment of a new investment structure under 
the conditions of a market economy are concerned, the reforms 
carried out in these 14 years have, in the process by which the 
old system is being destroyed and the new system is being 
established, played a role in exploration, experimentation, and 
laying down a base. Most of the reform measures have actively 
promoted the solution of existing problems and the development 
of the productive forces. On the whole, the reform of the 
investment structure in the past 14 years should be affirmed and 
taken as a point of departure for further studies on ways to 
deepen reform of the investment structure. 
  Looking back at the reform of the investment structure over 
the past 14 years, our second conclusion is: Due to the 
difficulty and complexity of the cause of reform, reform of the 
investment structure is bound to experience mistakes either in 
the planning of the program or in its implementation, thereby 
affecting the progress and effectiveness of reform. If we 
further assess the actual results of reform against the 
principles of a market economy, we can clearly see that the 
existing investment structure still bears the deep imprint of 
the traditional investment structure and has many drawbacks. In 
particular, a number of deep-level contradictions have yet to be 
resolved. We will try to analyze these contradictions from the 
following six angles: 
  1) Investment entities: Although multiple investment 
entities have been developed, in essence, enterprises have not 
totally renounced their role as appendages of government 
departments. In particular, the majority of state-owned 
enterprises still lack the ability to accumulate their own 
capital. They are still subject to administrative control and 
have not become truly independent investment entities. 
  2) Investment decisionmaking: The system of centralized 
decisionmaking by the central government, which has "cage-like" 
indices and unified policies as its distinctive features, is 
still used in forming macroeconomic investment policies. For 
most projects, there is a basic division of decisionmaking power 
between the central and local authorities and among departments. 
The simplification of examination and approval procedures has 
not brought about a complete change in the system of examination 
and approval by administrative departments. 
  3) Investment channels: Although there are now multiple 
channels for investment and fund-raising, the utilization of 
funds is still subject to direct government intervention and 
control to varying degrees. What we have is a disguised form of 
administrative allocation. It goes without saying that fiscal 
funds are thus allocated. However, domestic bank loans and 
funds raised through securities issues and foreign loans are 
either allocated in blocks or handed down to specific projects 
by the government. Investments by units with their own funds 
are also arranged in blocks in accordance with aggregate targets. 
  4) Investment operations: Because there has been no change 
in the administrative jurisdictional structure which poses 
barriers between ministries and regions, the formation and 
development of a long-term funds market has been sluggish and 
investment liquidity continues to be poor. The movement of 
funds between different industries and different regions is 
particularly difficult. With the deployment of resources still 
largely dependent on administrative orders and planning, the 
positive role of the market has still not been fully brought 
into play. 
  5) Investment management: Because the reform of the 
investment planning structure began quite late and the reforms 
have been quite passive, the functions, management means, and 
objectives of various management departments concerned with 
investment are still unclear. Administrative means still play 
the dominant role in investment management, and a new system of 
macroregulation and control has yet to take shape. 
  6) Investment responsibility: A strict system of 
responsibility and legal constraints have not been instituted 
for the whole process from investment decisionmaking to project 
implementation. Effective measures have yet to be developed as 
regards the bearer, scope and bearing of responsibility, and the 
problem of state-owned units all eating from "the same big pot" 
in investment still prevails to varying degrees. 
  Why is it that the distinctive features of the traditional 
investment structure not only have not been thoroughly removed 
from the existing investment structure but have produced 
negative effects in obstructing reform and hindering development 
to a greater or lesser extent? This is definitely not a natural 
outcome of reform itself. Rather, it shows that in reform we 
cannot expect to "get twice the result with half the effort." 
As the saying goes, "a boat sailing against the current must 
forge ahead or it will be driven back." Only by unswervingly 
adhering to a clear direction of reform and by speeding up and 
deepening the reform can we fundamentally eliminate the 
drawbacks of the traditional investment structure. This is the 
only way for China's investment structure to ultimately realize 
the transition from a planned economy to a market economy. 
<H3>  II. In Deepening the Reform It Is Necessary To Update and 
Change Several Concepts </H3>
  The scale of investment in China has seen more rapid growth 
since 1992. This rapid growth has continued in 1993, and is 
widely regarded as the main reason for the tense financial 
situation as a whole, particularly the money supply, and is 
deemed to be a possible cause of high inflation. Meanwhile, as 
localities and enterprises continue their fervent call to 
quicken development, the existing investment structure is seen 
as an obvious stumbling block in more ways than one. Under this 
historical backdrop, the question of investment and investment 
structure has once again become a subject of great concern to 
state leaders and basic-level enterprises alike. They have come 
to the conclusion that while speeding up the transformation of 
government functions, it is necessary to further reform the 
planning, financial, and monetary systems, with the focus on the 
investment structure. Over the past year, all kinds of 
proposals and suggestions have been put forward for the reform 
of the investment structure, but the views remain divided. An 
important reason for this is that people still differ in their 
concept and understanding of major issues in the investment 
realm. Although we are all talking about reform, we are widely 
divergent, even going in opposite directions on the goals, 
targets, and measures of reform. In view of this situation, we 
believe that when studying and putting forward proposals for 
deepening the reform of the investment structure, it is 
necessary to update and change from the high plane of theory 
some of the customary formulations and concepts originated from 
the traditional planned economy and understand afresh several 
major investment issues in accordance with market economy theory. 
  1. The question of controlling the scale of 
investment 
  In a modern market economy, macroregulation and control by 
the government has four target areas, namely, the economic 
growth rate, the employment rate, the inflation rate, and the 
international balance of payments. The scale of investment is 
an important economic variable. Changes in the scale of 
investment are mainly due to the market situation and the 
government's economic policies and are not the direct targets of 
government regulation and control. In other words, under a 
market economy, enterprises are the principal investment 
entities and investment activities are enterprise activities. 
The government cannot, and indeed should not, directly 
determine and control the overall scale of investment. Thus, in 
deepening reform of the investment structure, the state should, 
in a clear-cut way, change the method of directly controlling 
the scale of investment and cease the handing down of so-called 
"cages" or annual plans on the scale of investment. Such plans 
(particularly medium and long-term plans) may still be drawn up, 
but these should only be used by the state as a base for the 
formulation of macroeconomic policies and may be published as 
economic forecasts. Some comrades have suggested replacing 
regulation and control over the annual scale of investment by 
regulation and control of the overall scale of investment for 
projects under construction. In essence, this is still a 
concept of direct regulation and control under a planned 
economy. It not only goes against the principles of a market 
economy but is difficult to implement and is not feasible. 
However, the overall scale of investment for projects under 
construction is still of significance as a leading economic 
index unique to China. 
  Will there be a massive expansion of investment, as many 
fear, if the state changes its direct mandatory controls on the 
scale of investment? The conclusion we have drawn after summing 
up the experience of market economies is quite the contrary. 
Due to government intervention and influence in running the 
economy through the use of macroeconomic policies (including 
fiscal policies and tax policies, interest rates and exchange 
rates), investors are very sensitive to market signals and 
government policies. The fact that they are subject to strict 
constraints of their investment responsibility also contributes 
to the fundamental elimination of the causes of investment 
expansion. Some comrades insist that there should be direct 
controls on the scale of investment on the grounds that market 
economy mechanisms and enterprise constraints have not yet been 
developed. As soon as investment shows excessive growth, they 
advocate a return to the old practice, that is, suppression of 
the scale of investment, consolidation of existing projects, 
control of newly launched projects, and strict mandatory 
planning. This arbitrarily cuts off the natural course of the 
transition from a planned economy to a market economy, 
objectively prevents enterprises from truly becoming investment 
entities, and fetters the development of the productive forces. 
Actually, experience over the past 40 years and more has 
demonstrated time and again that direct government control of 
the scale of investment has never been truly successful in 
keeping the scale of investment under control. Rather, we have 
gone through a course of suppression--expansion-- further 
suppression--further expansion. We can no longer follow this 
course which simply has no future. 
  2. The question of the regulation and control of the 
investment structure 
  The investment structure includes the investment ratio 
between different industries and the investment ratio between 
different regions. In order to ensure the optimum deployment of 
resources between different industries and regions in accordance 
with the principles of a market economy, the flow of investment 
should be toward industries and regions with the best rate of 
return, and this should mainly be achieved through regulation by 
market mechanisms. In the past we have always been advocates of 
the regulation and control of the investment structure through 
the formulation of state industrial policies. However, it is 
not in accord with the principles of a market economy to treat 
industrial policies as mandatory policies. Industrial policies 
themselves are for guidance only and should mainly be 
implemented through various economic and technical policies, but 
state laws formulated in accordance with state industrial 
policies for specific industries and products are mandatory. 
The fixed assets investment orientation regulatory tax 
introduced in 1991 seems to be an economic means for indirect 
regulation and control, but in fact it is not completely cut off 
from the framework of an administrative means which embraces all 
trades and professions and entails direct intervention. This, 
complicated by how the tax revenue is distributed between the 
central and local governments and the overelaborate way of 
calculating how much tax should be levied, has made its actual 
implementation very difficult. This deserves attention. In 
future, the government should adopt necessary measures for the 
indirect control of the investment structure. The following are 
some of the major measures we should adopt: First, we should 
rationally determine the ratio between government investment and 
non-government investment in order to ensure that the government 
will have sufficient funds for public utilities and 
infrastructure construction. Second, we should correctly fix 
charges for infrastructural services in order to ensure that 
their revenues can at least cover operational costs. Third, we 
should adopt a policy of financial equilibrium and support the 
underdeveloped regions in their development of public utilities 
and infrastructure. In this connection, speeding up the pace of 
price reform and seeing to it that market mechanisms play their 
role in providing correct guidance is one of the key steps. Of 
course, the principles of a market economy do not completely 
reject government involvement in the structural readjustment of 
certain industries in the non-government sector through 
macroeconomic policies (such as supporting priority industries, 
supporting key projects, and promoting an export- oriented 
economy). However, such support does not normally take the form 
of direct investment. Rather, it is given through indirect 
means, such as preferential policies, discounts on exchange, or 
subsidized investment. 
  3. The question of preventing duplicate 
construction 
  The concept of duplicate construction is entirely a concept 
of the traditional planned economy. It means engaging in the 
construction of similar projects in addition to those already 
provided for in the state plan. They are generally regarded as 
superfluous and unnecessary. According to theories of the 
planned economy, we should expand the capacity of production in 
proportion to need and launch projects within the limits of 
funds and resources available. Thus, it is necessary to prevent 
"duplicate construction." Under the principles of a market 
economy, however, the prevention of duplicate construction is 
not tenable whether in theory or in practice. The basic laws of 
the market economy are: the law of value, the law of 
competition, and the law of supply and demand. Without some 
"duplication" in construction, supply and demand will be 
perfectly balanced (which is unlikely in real life in any case), 
and there will not be any competition. What this means is that 
market mechanisms will have no place in the optimum deployment 
of resources. More importantly, without competition and the 
elimination of the inferior through competition, it is 
impossible to increase efficiency and promote technological 
progress, and economic and social development as a whole will 
lose vigor and vitality. This was the situation which prevailed 
in many of our industrial enterprises prior to reform. 
  Hence, the concept of duplicate construction in the 
traditional sense can no longer be adhered to. If we find it 
necessary to avoid excessive competition or low-quality 
construction which wastes resources (duplicate construction in a 
given sense) during a period of transition when a mechanism of 
microeconomic constraints has yet to be developed, then rather 
than devising a system for the prevention of duplicate 
construction, we should make the best of the situation and 
create a mechanism and environment that can truly encourage and 
meet the needs of moderate competition between investors. Only 
by truly unfolding market competition and encouraging the 
movement of funds will it be possible to truly eliminate 
low-quality, low-return, and unreasonable duplicate 
construction. If we continue to resort to methods of planning, 
we will only encourage the practice of "vying for more 
investment and more new construction projects" and will have no 
way of prohibiting duplicate construction. This has been the 
situation in China over the past decades. 
  4. The question of the shortage of funds for key 
construction projects of the state 
  In market economies, the scope of government investment is 
usually clearly defined and mainly covers those sectors that are 
monopolistic and are not predominantly profit-oriented, such as 
public utilities and infrastructure. In the past, government 
investment in China covered all areas. After reform, the scope 
of government investment has been somewhat reduced and no longer 
covers all trades and professions, but it still covers a wide 
scope. Seen in terms of the key construction projects approved 
by the state each year and in terms of construction projects 
with state investment in different industries, the number is not 
very high, but the number of industries covered is very 
impressive. Such a state of affairs is not in accord with the 
operational laws of a market economy. One of the problems that 
can be directly attributed to this is the lack of congruence 
between the capacity of the government to invest and its scope 
of investment, and between its financial power and its 
administrative power. This is also the problem of the capital 
shortage for key state projects that we have been talking about 
all these years. 
  One line of thought for the solution of this problem is the 
planned economy approach. What this means is that we should 
concentrate financial resources by all and every means, thereby 
increasing the amount of funds directly controlled by and at the 
disposal of the government. In other words, the government 
should have greater financial power. According to the 
principles of a market economy, however, we should focus our 
efforts on reducing administrative interference and thoroughly 
put an end to the situation where government intervention in 
investment is both excessive and inefficient. In respect of 
those projects which definitely need government investment, 
apart from some public utility investment which will continue to 
need funds allocated by financial administration, other major 
social infrastructure projects should increasingly rely on the 
absorption and mobilization of social capital (such as public 
bidding and the issuance of bonds and shares). We should no 
longer follow the beaten track of centralized funding and direct 
allocation. 
  There are many other questions in the sphere of investment, 
such as how to do things in strict accordance with construction 
programs and overcome over-investment. If we look at 
enterprises as genuine investment entities in accordance with 
the concept of the market economy, we will be able to gain a new 
understanding of and give new meaning to these questions. Only 
when we have come to a consensus on these major theoretical and 
practical issues will there be a solid foundation for the design 
and implementation of investment structure reform. 
<H3>  III. The Target Model and Overall Framework for Reform of 
the Investment Structure in China </H3>
  If we briefly sum up the traditional model of investment 
structure as a direct management model based on mandatory 
investment plans and administrative examination and approval of 
projects, with government investment playing the dominant role, 
then the target model for an investment structure that meets the 
needs of the socialist market economy may be summed up as a 
capital factor distribution mechanism and management system 
based on market-regulated investment activities and decisions 
made at the investors' own risk, with enterprise investment 
playing the dominant role and the government exercising indirect 
regulation and control. 
  The above-mentioned target model for reform of the 
investment 
structure may be described as the realization of the following 
six fundamental changes: 
  1) Investment entities will change from entities with 
government investment or government activities playing the 
dominant role into entities with enterprise investment and 
enterprise activities playing the dominant role. The scope and 
ways of government investment will also be more clearly defined. 
  2) The market rather than the government will decide how 
investment, as long-term capital, is to deployed. The law of 
value and the law of average rate of profits will play a 
fundamental and principal regulatory role in the deployment of 
resources, while the government will only play a supplementary 
role. 
  3) The microeconomic bases of investment activities will 
change from enterprises which are no more than government 
appendages in terms of their administrative jurisdiction and 
which do not have complete investment decisionmaking power and 
responsibility constraints, into true economic entities with 
independent economic interests and clearly defined property 
relations. These entities will work under tough responsibility 
constraints and will make their own policy decisions, assume 
responsibility for their own profits and losses, manage their 
own affairs, and bear their own investment risks and 
responsibilities. 
  4) The mechanism for the deployment of various capital 
factors will change from one which relies on planned 
distribution into one which works on fair competition. The 
pricing of capital factors, such as interest rates, wages, 
rents, and the prices of investment goods, will be determined by 
the market and will be able to correctly reflect the scarcity of 
resources and the relationship between supply and demand. 
Capital factors will be free to circulate and will be naturally 
pooled and centralized in projects with high returns through 
fair competition. 
  5) The investment financing mechanism of enterprises and 
the government will change from one which works on allocation in 
accordance with planned targets into one which favors the 
flexible and diversified use of both direct and indirect 
investment, separates policy financing organs from commercial 
banks, and manages government investment as an entrepreneurial 
undertaking. 
  6) The means with which the government regulates investment 
activities will change from administrative orders by governments 
at various levels into the stimulation and constraint of the 
interests of investment entities. Through its financial 
policies, monetary policies, and various other economic levers, 
the government will make targeted corrections of market signals, 
thereby indirectly influencing (raising or lowering) the 
anticipated rate of return on investments and realizing the 
fixed macroeconomic goals of the government, while guiding 
enterprises to pursue their own economic interests in their 
investments. 
  The most essential characteristic of the target model for 
reform of the investment structure is as follows: Enterprises 
(including state-owned enterprises and other types of 
enterprises) have become the principal investment entities. 
They have a perfect investment and financing mechanism, have 
full power to make autonomous decisions on projects, regulate 
the movement of investment in accordance with the principle of 
maximum profits and market laws, and independently bear 
investment risks and responsibilities. The government's 
function in investment management has completely changed into 
one of macroeconomic management, indirect regulation and 
control, and the provision of policy guidance, information, and 
services. 
  The period between 1993 and 1995 will be a period for the 
implementation of the near-term program for deepening reform of 
the investment structure, while the "Ninth Five-Year Plan" 
period could be a period for the implementation of a long-term 
program. The overall framework for a long-term program could be 
based on the following four tasks: 
  1) Defining property relations and restoring enterprises as 
investment entities. This mainly refers to the introduction of 
the shareholding system to state-owned enterprises, the 
establishment of state-holding limited liability companies and 
limited joint-stock companies with large enterprise groups as 
the main form, and the separation of the economic management 
functions of the government and the ownership management 
functions of state-owned enterprises. 
  2) Improving management and operating systems for government 
investment. This mainly involves the division of capital 
construction funds into social public investment and industrial 
development investment. Social public investment shall be 
managed by the respective departments in accordance with state 
plans, while industrial development investment shall be managed 
by government investment companies. At the same time, a system 
of indirect investment management by the government based on a 
"state investment credit fund" and a "state long-term investment 
bank" shall also be established. 
  3) Making clear the social division of labor between 
different categories of investment entities. This mainly 
involves efforts to clarify the scope of government investment 
and divide investment between the central government and local 
governments in accordance with the principle of regional 
division of labor. There is no need to delimit the scope of 
private investment in various types of enterprises and by 
domestic and foreign investors. 
  4) Establishing an indirect macro-regulatory and control 
system for investment. This is mainly about making full use of 
investment policies, investment information, economic levers, 
legal means, and necessary administrative intervention in the 
indirect guidance and regulation of the activities of investment 
entities. 
<H3>  IV. Proposal on Near-term Measures for Deepening Reform of 
the Investment Structure </H3>
  Since the reform measures put forward in the target model 
and 
the overall framework of the long-term program for the reform of 
the investment structure will take time to gradually be put into 
implementation, the pressing nature of the reform makes it 
imperative for us to seize the following breakthrough points in 
taking substantial steps forward in deepening reform of the 
investment structure. In accordance with the principle of 
dovetailing with the target model and helping solve imminent 
problems in real life, we should concentrate on the following 
three areas in our immediate reforms. 
  1. Standardize and strengthen the constraints 
mechanism on state-owned investment entities 
  State-owned investment entities comprise three major types 
of 
investment entities, namely, the central government, local 
governments, and state-owned enterprises. Restricted by various 
conditions at present, apart from extremely rare cases like the 
Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation, very few state-owned 
enterprises can really be called independent investment 
entities. However, as far as the orientation of reform goes, 
state-owned enterprises will definitely become investment 
entities with a decisive role to play in the development of the 
national economy. The standardization of of investment 
entities' activities mainly involves two aspects, namely 
self-constraint mechanisms within investment entities and 
mechanisms for the state and society to guide and restrain the 
activities of investment entities. 
  1) Promote and improve the system of responsibility for 
construction project proprietors. In our present endeavor to 
invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we 
must concentrate on resolving the problem of "the lack of 
clarity in three respects," that is, the lack of clarity in 
property rights relationships, the lack of clarity between 
ownership and operating rights, and the lack of clarity between 
government and enterprise functions. The fundamental way to 
resolve this problem lies in the enterprises order at their 
root, that is, carrying out reform of the decision making, 
financing, and construction of projects. The establishment of 
the system of responsibility for construction project 
proprietors is an important measure in this reform, and efforts 
must be made to speed up this stage of reform. Seen from the 
trial implementation of this system on construction projects 
over the past year or so, we can see that standardizing the 
process whereby proprietors are generated, ensuring the full 
implementation of the powers of proprietors, establishing a 
mechanism of responsibility constraints and a mechanism of 
interest stimulation for proprietors, as well as improving 
relevant policies, laws and regulations and strengthening the 
service functions of the government, are key links in deepening 
this reform and producing actual results. 
  2) Reorganizing state-owned enterprises and clearly defining 
property rights relationships. 
  Investment and financing rights are rights enjoyed by the 
ownership principals in property rights relationships. In order 
to turn state-owned enterprises into true investment entities, 
it is necessary to grant them investment and financing rights. 
To this end, it is necessary first of all to clarify who has 
proprietary rights over the state-owned assets of enterprises. 
China has a vast number of state-owned enterprises, and there 
is a vast difference between the scale of enterprises and the 
management level and quality of their leaders. If we stipulate 
in general terms that factory directors or managers are 
representatives of the owners of state-owned assets of 
enterprises and give them full power of investment and 
financing, the resultant over-decentralization of investment and 
financing power and a host of poor policy decisions could 
inflict heavy losses on state-owned assets. A desirable 
approach is to reorganize state-owned enterprises by organizing 
(or incorporating) most of state-owned enterprises making up the 
"national team" into large or giant enterprise groups. In other 
words, we should amalgamate or merge state-owned enterprises 
around large or medium-sized enterprises with outstanding 
performance on the basis of voluntary collaboration. 
Medium-sized or small manufacturing enterprises with antiquated 
equipment and poor performance which no enterprise group wants 
may be declared bankrupt or sold to members of the public so 
that the state can redeem their assets. State-owned public 
utilities in localities may continue to be run by local 
governments. 
  3) Establishing a personal responsibility system for 
investment. There should be clearly defined property rights 
relationships in all enterprise groups, with the board of 
directors or management committee of each group exercising the 
powers and functions of the ownership entity on behalf of the 
state. Their responsible persons and principal members should 
be selected and appointed by the state- owned asset management 
department from among entrepreneurs. Enterprise groups are 
primary-level corporate bodies. They are vested with investment 
and financing power, assume responsibility for profits and 
losses in their operations, and hand over a given proportion of 
the profits to state-owned asset management departments. 
Basic-level enterprises within the group are secondary-level 
corporate bodies. They only have operating power and do not 
have ownership rights or investment power. They hand over all 
their profits to their enterprise group, which bears 
responsibility for their profits and losses. Their responsible 
persons only assume personal responsibility for operational 
results. Thus, the principals of these investment entities are 
the board of directors or management committees. Constraints on 
their investment activities are based on contracts that combine 
rights, responsibilities, and interests concluded on the basis 
of the benefits principle. Although the state does not 
interfere in their investment orientation, they must realize the 
annual targets for profit and assets appreciation stipulated in 
the contracts signed at the time of their appointment by the 
state. The contracts should also make clear their personal 
income, and promotion will be pegged to the overall performance 
of their enterprise group. In order to ensure the 
implementation of this system of personal responsibility for 
investment, it is necessary to strengthen the system of 
constraints and supervision on government investment managers by 
making public servants stake their "political life" on their 
investment decisions and management results. 
  4) Establishing an external mechanism of constraints for 
state- owned asset investment entities. Although results 
generated by different orientations of investment may assume 
different forms, whichever way investment goes people expect 
maximum results for the money they put in. Only in this way can 
we make our limited state-owned asset investment yield maximum 
results and fundamentally change the problem of serious wastage 
in state-owned asset investment. Thus, all talk about 
restraining the investment activities of state-owned asset 
investment entities centers around returns. In other words, 
constraints must have the improvement of investment returns as 
their major objective and are intended to make state-owned asset 
investment yield satisfactory results. In order to achieve this 
goal, it is necessary to continuously strengthen the system of 
scientific decisionmaking for investment projects, improve the 
system of investment auditing and supervision, promote the 
system of post-construction appraisal, and put the system of 
investment information and engineering consultation on a sound 
footing. In particular, we must speed up legislation in the 
realm of investment to bring investment activities into an orbit 
whereby investment entities' actions are standardized by law. 
  2. Improve and perfect the investment and financing 
systems of the government and enterprises 
  Under the market economy, government investment and 
enterprise investment differ greatly in target, scope, and form. 
This makes it necessary to have separate investment and 
financing systems for the government and for enterprises. 
  1) Enlarge the investment and financing mechanism in the 
form of government shareholding. In the international arena, 
participation in projects by way of share investment and 
financing is a basic form of government investment and 
financing. At present, expanding key construction funds by 
gradually increasing the shareholding weighting in total 
investment, practicing diverse share investment and financing 
methods, and issuing shares to obtain new investment has become 
an objective inevitability. 
  2) Put existing state-owned asset investment and financing 
mechanisms on a sound footing. The irrational deployment of the 
huge amount of existing assets in China often imposes serious 
restrictions on the optimum organization of limited new 
investment. China has state-owned assets worth nearly 2,000 
billion yuan. Of these, about one-third either lie idle or 
operate inefficiently. The irrational deployment of existing 
assets not only results in the waste of a large amount of new 
investment, but greatly restricts the scale of new investment in 
key construction projects. Thus, it is necessary to do away 
with "insulation" between existing assets and new investment and 
to turn surplus assets into a new flow of investment which 
covers key construction. At the present stage, the conversion 
of existing assets into new investment may be realized through 
the marketization of existing assets. 
  3) Strengthen the self-accumulation mechanism of 
enterprises. In the development of enterprises, the forms and 
channels of investment and financing are multifaceted. Seen in 
terms of raising funds internally and drawing funds in from 
outside, there are two major forms of investment and financing 
by enterprises, namely, their own capital and borrowed 
investment. The experience of developed countries clearly tells 
us that in investment and financing, enterprises should focus on 
the internal accumulation and expansion of funds rather than 
drawing funds from outside. In raising of industrial capital, 
enterprises in developed countries obtain most of their funds, 
or at least half, through internal fund raising. The investment 
and financing structure of Chinese enterprises is extremely 
irrational. This is mainly manifested in imbalances in the 
asset and liability structure of enterprises. When an 
enterprise does not even have 20 percent of the funds needed and 
uses loans to cover the other 80 percent of the funds necessary 
to expand production, they will naturally have difficulty 
expanding their scale of investment and financing. In order to 
increase the ability of enterprises to build up their own 
accumulation and develop, it is necessary to strengthen the 
self- accumulation mechanisms of enterprises. On the one hand, 
it is necessary to strengthen the replacement investment 
mechanism of enterprises on the basis of accelerated 
depreciation. On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen 
the mechanism whereby retained profits are turned into 
additional investment for expanding production. 
  4) Establish a securities investment and financing mechanism 
for enterprises. 
  As the present state of affairs in Chinese enterprises 
shows, 
there are imbalances in the raising and utilization of 
construction funds: too much liability financing and too little 
investment using their own capital, too much short-term 
financing and too little long-term financing. A more salient 
problem is that there is too much indirect financing and too 
little direct financing. There are currently many barriers 
preventing enterprises from entering the securities market. It 
is medium-sized and small enterprises rather than large 
enterprises that have been given permission to raise funds 
through the issuance of bonds and shares. Today, bonds and 
shares account for less than 10 percent of enterprises' 
construction funds. Thus, it is necessary to gradually open 
more channels of securities investment and financing for 
enterprises and enlarge the scale of direct financing. This 
will also be of great help to strengthening the self-restraining 
mechanism of enterprises. 
  3. Establish and improve the macroregulatory and 
control system for government investment 
  First of all, we must make clear the aim, object, means and 
bases of the macroregulation and control of investment: 1) The 
aim of macroregulation and control of investment is to sustain 
rapid and healthy development under existing low levels of 
inflation. The indirect regulation and control of the overall 
scale and structure of investment serves this objective. In 
other words, the aim of regulation and control is to arouse the 
enthusiasm of all quarters for investment and promote economic 
development, not to inhibit enthusiasm for investment. 2) The 
object of the macroregulation and control of investment is to 
promptly regulate and control the parameters of the investment 
market and indirectly influence the investment activities of 
enterprises. It does not seek to directly control the 
activities of investors or to exercise decisionmaking power on 
enterprise investment entities. 3) Means of macroregulation 
and control of investment are indirect. This mainly relies on 
economic means, supplemented by necessary administrative 
intervention. It is of a guiding rather than a mandatory 
nature, and is service rather than command based. 4) The bases 
of the macroregulation and control of investment are threefold: 
First, the establishment of a microeconomic investment 
operational mechanism (mainly for enterprises), especially the 
establishment of a mechanism of self-constraint; second, the 
perfection of market development; and third, the support of 
other institutional reforms, especially reform of the financial, 
monetary, and pricing systems. These are the prerequisites for 
the full implementation of various measures for the 
macroregulation and control of investment. 
  The establishment of an indirect macroregulatory and control 
system for investment involves a wide range of tasks. In the 
near- term, we may focus on the following three areas in our 
reform endeavors: 
  1) Fully activate and strengthen the financial means of 
regulation and control. The financial means here refer to funds 
(money) financing centering around bank credit. The principal 
function of the financial regulatory and control mechanism is to 
regulate and control total demand through the regulation of the 
money supply. The common means include statutory reserve funds, 
open market operations, and rediscount and relending rates. At 
present, we should attach importance to the regulatory and 
control function of the interest rate lever. The reason is that 
in investment, the anticipated rate of return determines whether 
or not an enterprise will invest, and the level of the 
anticipated rate of return has a close bearing on the level of 
interest rates and taxation. Thus, as a market parameter or 
signal, it is obvious what effects interest rates will have on 
investment. However, from the way the government's regulatory 
means and indirect regulatory and control mechanisms exercise 
regulation and control, we can see that the government is 
obviously trying to affect interest rates by using its monetary 
policy to regulate the money supply in the whole society, and 
through this to indirectly regulate and control investment. 
Hence, it is necessary to gradually delegate the power of 
interest rate adjustment to the lower levels and rationally 
structure deposit and lending rates so that the interest rate 
lever can regulate investment activities in a flexible and 
positive way. 
  2) Accelerate the establishment of a system of state 
investment credit funds and organize a long-term state 
investment bank. This state investment credit fund is a 
long-term credit fund pooled by the central government in the 
form of state credits from the public. It offers compensatory 
payments in accordance with the principle of exchange at equal 
value and is spent on fixed asset investments in line with the 
policy objectives of the state. Our aim in establishing an 
international credit fund and organizing a long-term state 
investment bank lies in searching for and creating a flexible 
and effective macroregulatory and control tool that not only 
meets the needs of investment in a market economy but can 
effectively guide the flow of non-governmental investment. 
  3) Replace the existing system of administrative examination 
and approval with a system of project registration. We should, 
in accordance with the principles of a socialist market economy, 
reform the system whereby construction projects are decided. 
Specifically, we should make clear the "three separations." 
  First, we should separate the making of decisions on 
launching of projects from administrative management. How much 
money should go into a project, where the investment should go, 
when to invest, the form of investment, investment returns, and 
so forth are all matters that must be taken into consideration 
in making decisions on projects. In these matters, the decision 
should be made by the investors themselves, and government 
approval should not be required. The effects of projects on 
town planning, land use, the environment, employment, safety, 
and other points of public and state interest come under the 
jurisdiction of administrative management and must be examined 
and approved by government departments concerned in accordance 
with the law. 
  Second, we should separate the investment function of the 
government from the management function of the government in 
investment. In the past, we were often told that government- 
invested projects must be examined and approved by the 
government. This measure was ambiguous and failed to separate 
the two functions. It is also not conducive to making the 
government concentrate its energy on strengthening its 
investment management (particularly macroregulation and control) 
function. Thus, the investment function of the government 
should be handed down to enterprises that handle government 
investment and project decisionmaking should be left to these 
enterprises. The government may set production and profit 
targets and leave construction and operations to the contracted 
enterprises. As regards the small number of government-invested 
projects with a vital bearing on national or regional 
development, a system of review and decisionmaking by local 
councils (people's congresses) may be practiced, as is done in 
foreign countries. 
  Third, we should separate the system of project 
decisionmaking from the system of project registration. 
Following the establishment of a system where construction 
projects are decided upon by investors themselves, it is 
necessary to establish a strict system of project registration. 
This will serve as a crucial foundation for efforts to ensure 
the accuracy of the state's macroeconomic investment policies 
and the effectiveness of its macroregulation and control.

  [Text] Beijing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- China is drawing up 
a seven-year plan for the expansion of its coal industry in a 
bid to raise its coal output to 1.4 billion tons by the year 
2000. 
  The plan, manifesting China's medium- and long-term strategy 
in this sector, will be announced shortly, an official of the 
Ministry of Coal Industry said today. 
  As the most important primary source of energy in China, 
coal 
accounts for more than two-thirds of the country's energy 
consumption. In 1993 alone, China produced 1.14 billion tons of 
coal, an increase of 25 million tons over 1992. 
  The output is expected to top 1.16 billion tons this year, 
the ministry official said. 
  He said 1993 will be the crucial year for the coal industry 
to complete the shift from a planned economy to a market 
economy. The government is scheduled to lift all its control 
over coal prices by the end of this year. 
  In order to be answerable to the market, he said, the major 
state-owned coal mines will continue to maintain production in 
line with demand as well as transportation capacity. 
  One of the principal goals of the industry this year will be 
reducing production costs and improving labor efficiency, he 
said. This necessitates the optimization of the coal mines. 
  Loss-making mines with no hope of making profits will be 
shut 
down, suspended or shifted to other lines of production, while 
those with quality coal, good market access and high efficiency 
will step up technological upgrading to increase their 
production. 
  The product mix and the industrial structure will also be 
streamlined, the official said, adding that efforts will be made 
to pursue diversified operations. 
  The locally-run mines will be screened, with emphasis placed 
on the construction of 100 top-priority coal-producing counties 
and 15 coal-mining areas, the official said. 
  In an effort to speed up the construction of coal mines, the 
ministry wooed other sectors to invest in the area, in light of 
the principle of "He benefits who invests." It has already 
extended a welcome to the industries of electrical power, 
metallurgy, chemicals and transportation. 
  The ministry is also encouraging coastal regions to invest 
in 
coal-rich areas and foreign investors to form joint ventures and 
cooperative coal mines. 
  China will be active in attracting more foreign funds and 
introducing advanced equipment, technology and experts as well 
as management experience from abroad to raise productivity. 
  He said that this year some of the major coal mines will be 
licensed to handle exports, which stood at 18 million tons in 
1993.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "New Prices To Boost Coal Mining"] </F>
  [Text] The coal industry will make ends meet for the first 
time in its history by 1996, said a senior official last week. 
  The prediction, by Vice-Minister of Coal Industry Pu 
Hongjiu, 
comes after coal prices were floated on the open market as the 
central government lifted controls last weekend. 
  With the new prices, the industry expects to reduce its 
losses by 4 billion yuan ($460 million) this year and in 1995. 
  It has run at a loss for decades due to rigid central 
planning, government price controls, and rising costs of 
materials. 
  When coal prices were under State control, they were too low 
for mines to meet production costs, let alone to make profits. 
  But prices of materials, such as steel, wood and cement, had 
been allowed to float on the market years ago. 
  Throughout these years the coal industry received subsidies 
from the central government to maintain operations. 
  Pu Hongjiu said the central government is taking a 
soft-landing policy in the coal pricing system. 
  In 1992, prices of some 300 million tons of coal were freed 
and the prices of another 600 million were floated in 1993. 
  Coal makes up 75 percent of China's energy consumption. 
  And 70 percent of the country's installed electric power 
capacity of 180 million kilowatts, comes from coal-fired 
generators. 
  Pu said coal mines which had been allowed to sell their 
products at market prices had already made profits. 
  Pricing reforms, important to the country's transition from 
central planning to a socialist market economy, were first tried 
with mines in Anhui Province. 
  The industry chose these mines because demand for their 
higher- quality products, was stable. 
  Their clients are concentrated in East China, where the 
economy has developed faster than in other parts of the country. 
  Pu said the mines in Anhui are among the most efficient 
enterprises in the industry. 
  So far, the freeing of coal prices has had positive results. 
  However, reports say some industries are thinking of using 
the reform as an excuse to raise the price of their own products. 
  A Ministry of Coal Industry official said it would take 
months for coal prices to float to the levels that permit coal 
mines to meet production costs and then make profits. 
  There is currently a glut of coal with about 200 million 
tons 
are stored at mines and electric power plants. 
  Analysts say the industry will have to beef up co-ordination 
among coal mines to cut production so that retail prices rise by 
a reasonable margin. 
  Co-ordination will be tough as the ministry has a strong 
influence only on large and medium-sized mines. 
  Many small mines are governed by regional authorities and 
other ministries such as the Ministry of Agriculture. 
  The industry used to employ 7 million people to dig some 1.1 
billion tons of raw coal, but hundreds of thousands of them have 
now been transferred to other jobs. 
  Due to China's backward social welfare system, the industry 
has to provide living means to 800,000 retired workers.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Steel Imports To Tumble"] </F>
  [Text] Demand for steel will remain constant this year but 
imports will plummet, partly because of high domestic stocks, 
said a top manager last week. 
  Excessive imports last year inflated inventories to around 
25 
million tons by the end of last month, which was 7-8 million 
more than normal, estimated Zhen Yongdian, Vice-President of 
China National Metals and Minerals Import &amp; Export 
Corporation 
(Minmetals). 
  "China needs at least three months to clear the stock," Zhen 
said. 
  He predicted a recovery of steel consumption in the second 
half of the year as the country's GDP keeps growing by 8-9 
percent. 
  And he sought to dispel widespread speculation that China's 
steel imports would continue to tumble or even stop, arguing 
that the fall is only a reasonable response to the abnormalities 
of last year. 
  "China imported 25.8 million tons of steel in the first 11 
months of last year, which was an all-time record," he said. 
  He estimated the nation's steel imports for all of 1993 at 
27 
million tons. 
  And he attributed last year's brisk demand to the country's 
rapid economic development fueled by senior leader Deng 
Xiaoping's reform- boosting trip to south China in early 1992. 
  But he pointed to an unsettling factor that had brought 
about 
a glut of steel imports in home markets. 
  "There were too many speculators fiddling with steel imports 
and State controls had failed," he said. 
  Huge amounts of steel were imported through barter and 
border 
trade and overseas=funded ventures, besides licensed companies 
like Minmetals. 
  "These chaotic imports, which cropped up during China's 
transition from a planned economy to a market one, were 
abnormal," Zhen said. 
  The steel imports boom came to a halt last July after the 
central government moved to slow the pace of economic 
development. 
  "But in the longer term, China will remain one of the 
world's 
largest consumers of steel," Zhen said. 
  "Despite a steady growth in domestic production, china will 
still need to import steel in the future," he predicted. For, 
as the economy develops, the growth rate of domestic production 
has to keep up with the growth in the country's gross domestic 
product, he explained. However, it is unlikely to do so for now. 
  "And even if the domestic production and demands are 
balanced, our steel imports would continue, especially in 
certain high-quality categories like tin plate, special plates, 
petroleum pipes and silicon steel," he added. 
  However, he said that although the State had dropped the 
tariffs on certain steel items, the devaluation of the renminbi, 
brought about by a uniform foreign exchange rate, would raise 
the price of steel imports. 
  Minmetals, China's largest steel trader, accounts for more 
than half of the country's import orders, despite growing 
competition from mushrooming domestic rivals. 
  The company has formed world-wide import channels over the 
past decades.

a 58.8-km-long expressway linking the city proper with the 
Badaling Great Wall to the northeast, city officials said today. 
  The six-lane expressway will require an investment of 3.6 
billion yuan, to be jointly provided by the highway 
administration of the municipal government and the Tianhe 
Company from Hong Kong, the officials said. 
  The expressway, starting from the Madian cloverleaf on the 
northeast and ending at the Badaling Great Wall, one of 
Beijing's chief tourist attractions, will also greatly improve 
Beijing's link with Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia, which now 
account for one- fifth of the traffic flow to the capital, the 
officials added.

  [Text] Beijing, January 11 (XINHUA) -- China's electronics 
industry has given priority to improving its production 
structure and developing new products in a bid to improve its 
efficiency. 
  In 1993 the total output value of the industry was 135 
billion yuan (over 18 billion U.S. dollars), 24 percent more 
than that of the previous year. 
  Some 97 percent of its products have been put on the market. 
  Last year the installation of satellite telecommunication 
ground stations increased by 750 percent, production of 
program-controlled telephone exchanges went up by 190 percent, 
and production of micro computers increased by 80 percent. 
  The production of some major electronics items such as large 
integrated circuits, semiconductor separators and kinescopes 
maintained a good momentum. 
  The production value of newly-developed products in 
Shanghai, 
Tianjin, Beijing and Jiangsu Province achieved an average 
increase of over 20 percent. 
  In 1993 Shanghai, the biggest city in China, developed some 
600 new products. 
  Electronics industry exports increased by 20 percent last 
year.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 12 (AFP)--A shortage of water is 
costing the Chinese economy some two billion yuan (230 million 
dollars) a year, water ministry officials were quoted as saying 
Wednesday [12 January]. Top government cadres have admitted that 
a lack of investment was partly responsible for the 
water-shortage crisis that was afflicting two-thirds of Chinese 
cities as of last year, according to official statistics. The 
water ministry officials told the GUANGMING DAILY that the 
resulting economic losses were causing serious concern at all 
government levels and they called on people to save water 
wherever possible. 
  The newspaper also quoted the mayor of the free-wheeling 
southern special economic zone of Shenzhen as saying water 
shortfalls were making it impossible to implement reforms and 
maintain rapid economic development. The lack of attention 
given to the water crisis is the most serious mistake China has 
made in the past 10 years, the mayor said. Shenzhen's daily 
water shortfall is currently estimated at 100,000 cubic metres 
(3.5 million cubic feet). 
  The newspaper also quoted officials in Beijing as saying 
that, by 2000, the capital will have no quality drinking water 
unless steps are taken immediately.

  [Text] Beijing, January 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Government 
issued a circular here today to strictly ban the sales of 
non-iodized salt to the state's vast iodine deficient (IDD) 
areas, so as to help prevent the occurrence of iodine deficiency 
diseases. 
  The circular, co-issued by the State Administration of 
Industry and Commerce (SAIC), the Ministry of Public Health and 
China National Light Industry Council, demands that on no 
account should any non-iodized salt or inferior iodized salt be 
allowed to enter the salt markets in the iodine deficient areas. 
Severe penalties will be assessed to those who transport or 
sell the above-mentioned salt to the endemic regions. 
  To ensure a sound administration of the state's salt 
markets, 
which have shown some disorder in parts of the country, the 
government will issue new permits to the enterprises which are 
qualified for salt production or wholesale transaction of salt 
products. 
  The SAIC has set April 30 as the deadline for the salt 
enterprises to renew their registrations. 
  According to Yin Dakui, vice-minister of public health, 
China 
is one of the countries in the world with severe IDD prevalence. 
  Yin said that the most effective way to eliminate IDD is the 
constant consumption of iodized salt, which is also China's 
long-term strategy to prevent such endemic diseases. 
  According to the vice-minister, the government has set the 
goal to make all salt in China iodized by 1996 and to eliminate 
IDD nationwide by the year 2000. 
  Yin noted that marked progress has already been achieved in 
the prevention and treatment of IDD since the founding of the 
People's Republic of China in 1949. 
  According to him, a total of 385 institutes for IDD control 
have been set up nationwide in the past decades. And with the 
preventive measures and treatment over many years, the original 
35 million patients with endemic goiter in the country have been 
reduced to 7 million and the new occurrence of endemic cretinism 
has been controlled.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yang Shanqing (2799 0810 3237)] </F>
  [Text] Changsha, 25 Dec (XINHUA) -- State Councillor Chen 
Junsheng stressed today that action to bring down grain prices 
and stabilize the market represents one important measure of 
macroeconomic control today. 
  From 21 to 24 December, Chen Junsheng conducted inspections 
of Hunan's grain market and studied problems in the province's 
agriculture and rural economic development. Chen Junsheng said: 
Grain procurement prices were rather low. Therefore, the 
appropriate upward movement of grain prices has a reasonable 
side to it because peasants will be able to get good prices for 
their grain. However, in some localities grain prices have risen 
sharply over a short period of time; this is abnormal. He 
pointed out: Total grain output for 1993 is expected to top 450 
billion kg. The amount of grain procured will be roughly the 
same as last year. As of now, the grain procurement plan is 80 
percent complete, state grain depots are well-stocked, and there 
is more than enough grain to ensure adequate supply. He added: 
Why are grain prices rising sharply in some localities? 
Reports from localities indicate the following reasons: 1) A 
chain reaction to grain price rises in some major grain 
marketing areas. 2) Some peasants are unwilling to sell grain 
in the belief grain prices will increase next year; certainly, 
natural disasters are also a factor. 3) State-owned grain 
departments -- notwithstanding the great deal of work they have 
done in terms of procurement and marketing -- have failed to 
bring into full play their role as the major channel of 
circulation. Chen Junsheng stressed: We must increase 
macroeconomic control; we must ensure market stability and bring 
to a quick end the irrational, runaway increases in grain price 
in some localities so the interests of both producers and 
consumers are protected. 
  Chen Junsheng pointed out: In drafting next year's 
production plans, we must see to it the readjustment of the 
rural production structure and the development of a type of 
farming that provides high yields of fine quality with maximum 
efficiency are carried out under the preconditions of a steady 
increase in grain output. He added: We are in the middle of a 
severe winter. Localities must take advantage of all favorable 
conditions to help people in disaster-ridden areas; in 
particular, they should properly handle the food supply for the 
victims of natural calamities. 
  Accompanying him in the inspection tour were Yang Yongzhe, 
deputy director of the State Council Research Office, and Zhang 
Yanxi, vice minister of agriculture.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Si Liang (1835 5328): "Panic </F>
Grain Purchase in Mainland China Reflects the Masses' Fear of 
Inflation"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 12 January (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since 
late November last year, a wave of grain price hikes appeared 
for a short time in many localities. Fortunately, the local 
governments rapidly put the grain in stock on the markets, and 
quickly brought the grain prices under control, and the wave of 
panic purchases did not spread any further. However, this 
aroused people's serious attention to the price tendency this 
year. 
  This year is of crucial importance for the in-depth 
development of economic structural reform in the mainland, so it 
is called a "reform year." Taxation, banking, company, 
investment, foreign exchange, price, housing, and wage reform 
measures will put into practice. Reform will advance more 
deeply, more broadly, more intensively and with greater 
difficulty than in previous years. The unstable factors that 
existed latently over a long time may become more intense. 
Therefore, the authorities will strive to keep prices stable 
and bring inflation under strict control. This will be a major 
guarantee for reform's success. 
  In fact, the panic grain purchasing appearing late last year 
was an event beyond the expectation of the authorities. Last 
year, grain production decreased in Hebei because of the serious 
drought, and also decreased by nearly 10 percent in Guangdong 
because the construction of factories and the development of 
real estate projects used too much farmland. However, grain 
production in the whole country still increased by over 10 
billion kilograms, and there should be no shortage in the 
markets. According to analysts, the substantial grain price 
increases and the panic grain purchases in Beijing, Guangzhou, 
Fuzhou, and other cities late last year were mainly caused by 
some psychological factors: First, as the central authorities 
decided to increase grain prices in 1994, peasants were not 
willing to sell the grain on hand. Second, the local 
authorities did not take effective measures for regulating and 
controlling the supply of grain after grain transactions became 
free. Third, the masses misunderstood the reform measures put 
into practice in 1993, especially the reform of the taxation 
system, and thought that the new taxation system would certainly 
bring about price increases. So they rushed to buy grain, 
cooking oil, and other foodstuffs in order to preserve the value 
of their income. 
  Although the recent grain price hike was mainly caused by 
psychological and speculative factors, the phenomenon also 
reflected people's fear of price hikes and inflation, and 
indicated that society's ability to endure inflation might have 
been overestimated. Now, the common people have become more 
sensitive to and more fearful of inflation. Therefore, it is 
necessary to carefully consider and decide the timing of 
adopting the new reform measures and to pay close attention to 
price tendencies. Otherwise, when the major reform measures are 
put into practice this year, they may bring some shocks to 
society and became a factor leading to economic and social 
instability. 
  In fact, the retail prices in the mainland increased by 13 
percent last year, and the costs of living in 35 large and 
medium- sized cities increased by 20 percent. The rate of 
inflation has caused a considerable pressure on the livelihood 
of salary earners. According to the decision of the central 
authorities, in 1994 the national economy will maintain 
"sustained, rapid, and healthy" [chi xu kuai su jian kang 6688 
4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development, and GNP will grow by 
about 9 percent over 1993. Although this growth rate will be 
somewhat lower than the 1993 figure of 13 percent, it is 
expected that economic growth, as well as the size of 
investment, in the first few months of this year will remain at 
a high level, and it will be hard to effect the so-called 
economic "soft landing." In addition, as tariff rates for 
imported goods will be lowered, more high-priced imported goods 
will pour into China; the potential credit demand will increase 
after the exchange rate of renminbi was unified; and the prices 
of some energy and farm products will be further increased. All 
this may lead to a sharp increase in the inflation rate. 
  This shows that the task of macro-control that the central 
government is facing this year will still be rather arduous. If 
the intensity of economic regulation and control is appropriate 
and effective in restraining the rise of the general price 
level, then there will be no major market fluctuations. On the 
contrary, however, if prices increase too rapidly, it will be 
hard to prevent a high inflation situation, and a vicious cycle 
may also come into being. Reportedly to prevent too serious an 
unfavorable impact on the market and on the people's daily 
lives, the central authorities have decided to strive to keep 
this year's price increase index at a level below 10 percent and 
to adopt such measures as increasing wages and allowances and 
increasing peasants' income in order to offset this year's grain 
and other price increases to guarantee that the people will 
enjoy solid benefits in the course of reform. 
  Not long ago, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji stressed that 
stabilizing grain prices and restraining inflation will be the 
key to the smooth advances of reform in 1994. This showed that 
the Chinese top leaders were soberly aware of the importance of 
keeping the balance between reform and stability.

"Central Authorities Allocate Huge Funds To Establish Risk Fund 
To Stabilize Grain Prices and Guarantee Peasants' Interests"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--According to an 
authoritative source here, the top leadership has decided to 
allocate as least 2.8 billion yuan to set up a grain risk fund 
in order to stabilize grain prices. In addition, as adjustments 
in the price of grain purchased in line with this particular 
state policy may increase urban residents' cost of living, the 
problem will be solved by increasing urban workers' wages. 
  The source said that the central leadership required central 
and local financial departments to play a leading role in 
establishing a grain risk fund after prices are adjusted in 
light of market forces in order to promote agricultural 
production and guarantee peasants' interests. The central 
authorities will allocate 2.8 billion yuan to various localities 
to set up grain funds. At the same time, local authorities are 
also required to allocate funds from their own financial 
resources to set up grain risk funds. 
  The source said: The recent sharp increases in the prices of 
grain and cooking oil were caused by psychological factors, 
speculation, and temporary factors on the whole. Concretely 
speaking, the price hike occurred first in Guangdong, and then 
spread to other coastal areas. Because the law of marginal 
returns has played its role, the area of land sown with grain 
crops in Guangdong has decreased substantially. Now, as the 
grain market has been opened, if the price of imported grain was 
affordable, people would eat imported grain; as the price of 
imported grain was too high, people competed with each other to 
buy domestic grain. As a result, the price of grain was driven 
up. 
  In fact, our country reaped a good harvest of grain crops in 
1993, and stocks are also adequate. The transportation of grain 
was also in a normal condition. Therefore, it is completely 
possible to overcome the incorrect ideas of some local and 
departmental leaders who regard the price hikes as harmless, 
remove people's misgivings and misunderstandings, and rapidly 
bring grain prices under control and back to a normal condition. 
  The source quoted a central leader as saying that the grain 
price is the basic price in the market so it is necessary to 
bring it under control as it has a bearing on the national 
economy, the people's livelihood, and social stability. This is 
also common practice in all countries practicing the market 
economy, and is the main point in our domestic macroeconomic 
control. Therefore, the central authorities will be thoroughly 
responsible for this. 
  This source also said that the central authorities had 
worked 
out a scheme for raising urban workers' wages in order to offset 
the impact of grain prices on the cost of living. The basic 
monthly wage of 200 yuan will be increased by 30 percent so that 
grain price increases in 1994 will also be offset. 
  The central authorities plan to keep the rate of grain price 
increases in 1994 to below 10 percent.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Correctly Grasp the Signal of </F>
Grain and Edible Oil Prices"] 
  [Text] Given that soaring grain and edible oil prices in 
some parts of southern China have affected the country's grain 
and oil market, the state is taking swift measures to keep grain 
and oil prices down. With various measures gradually put in 
place, grain and oil prices have started to stabilize and will 
drop to the previous level. Agricultural workers and the vast 
numbers of peasants should have a sober understanding of this. 
  The current fluctuation in grain and oil prices is abnormal, 
with some temporary, psychological, and speculative factors 
playing a promoting role. In spite of this, it has also sounded 
the alarm to people: We must not lower our guard on the grain 
issue and on no account should we relax grain production. 
  Taken as a whole, the current price of grain purchased 
according to contract or at a negotiated price is still on the 
low side. To a certain extent this has affected the enthusiasm 
of peasants to grow grain and sell it to the state. If we have 
grain in our hand, we will not be in a commotion. Only when the 
state has ample grain reserves in its grain depots can it 
allocate and transfer grain as necessary and keep grain prices 
at an appropriate level. The grain in state grain depots is 
purchased from the peasants according to contract or at 
negotiated prices. Only when the prices are right will the 
peasants enthusiastically sell grain to the state and only thus 
can the state grain depots be stocked with ample grain. 
Therefore, appropriately raising grain purchasing prices is 
something that should not be overlooked. The state is gradually 
solving this issue. 
  The need to attach great importance to grain production is a 
fundamental issue. Although the psychological factor 
contributes considerably to the rocketing grain and oil prices 
in some parts of southern China, grain is still relatively 
insufficient in specific places. This tells us that grain is a 
special commodity indispensable to all people in their daily 
life. There should be an ample supply of grain at any time, and 
this should be based on a bumper harvest with increased output. 
For this reason, it is necessary to maintain certain grain 
acreage and ensure a stable increase in grain output; increase 
input in grain production, improve grain-growing conditions, and 
raise per-unit yield; and pay attention to adjusting the grain 
products structure and improving grain quality so as to meet 
people's gradually increasing needs in material life. 
  It should be mentioned that some localities have blindly 
opened development zones. In doing so they have used many grain 
fields and caused a reduced grain output this year. As there is 
less grain, prices naturally rise. As a result, they have to 
buy grain in other places and are very worried. This is a 
lesson worth learning. In opening up development zones we must 
make overall plans, take all factors into consideration, and 
ensure that grain acreage will not be reduced. In such a big 
country with a large population like ours, this should be taken 
as a principle. 
  The fluctuation in grain and oil prices is a signal we must 
correctly grasp. Seeing that grain prices are rocketing, some 
peasants become more enthusiastic to grow grain. This is beyond 
reproach. However, we should also stress quality. That is to 
say, we should grow strains that are readily marketable. 
Otherwise, if the products are unmarketable, it will be a 
burden. Seeing that the state is keeping down grain prices, 
some other peasants are less enthusiastic to grow grain. This 
is incorrect. In keeping down grain prices, the state wants to 
keep them at an appropriate level. It is not aimed at keeping 
them as low as possible. Rather, the state wants to keep grain 
prices at a level which enables grain growers to have a 
reasonable income and which the grain-consuming urban residents 
can afford. We should unswervingly attach importance to grain 
production and strive to gain a bumper harvest with increased 
grain output.

  [Text] Beijing, January 11 (XINHUA)-- Chinese rural 
residents put over 126 billion yuan into banks in 1993, which 
brings the total private deposits in the Agricultural Bank of 
China (ABC) and rural credit cooperatives to a record high of 
610 billion yuan. 
  The figure ranks the Agricultural Bank of China first among 
the four state specialized banks in terms of the personal 
savings each bank holds. 
  According to an ABC official, the bank recalled some 5.8 
billion yuan extended to non-financial institutions under the 
name of inter- bank lending by the end of last year, meanwhile 
providing 230 billion yuan in direct loans to agricultural 
production, representing a net increase of 30 billion yuan as 
against the previous year. 
  And thank to the ABC's strict management of funds, there 
were 
much fewer cases of "IOU" reported throughout the country during 
the purchase of grain and other agricultural products last year. 
  To help the growth of township enterprises, the bank made 
loans of over 335 billion yuan to the rural firms and a 
considerable portion of the loans went to the under-developed 
central and western regions. 
  The bank official revealed that the central government has 
decided to increase the amount of loans to the agricultural 
sectors to some 10 percent of total bank lendings this year from 
six percent in 1993. 
  This year, ABC's lending will mainly go to agriculture 
production which either has high economic returns or can earn 
more foreign currency. 
  It will also support the technical renovation of some 
efficient rural industries so as to make their products more 
competitive, said the official.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Peasant Brothers, Do Not Be </F>
Reluctant To Sell Your Grain"] 
  [Text] Recently grain prices have risen sharply in some 
parts of southern China, and this is not a normal phenomenon. 
China's grain harvest this year is larger than that of last 
year, there are sufficient grain reserves, and there is no 
problem with the balance of supply and demand. Due to the 
unusually low grain prices in the past, appropriate rises in 
grain prices under market regulation are inevitable. However, 
the drastic rises we are now seeing are totally propelled by 
certain temporary and psychological factors. 
  What needs to be pointed out is that some of our peasant 
brothers are reluctant to sell grain in the face of abnormally 
sharp price rises. Believing that "it is better to sell when 
prices are going down, not up," they intend to store more grain 
and wait for a better price. Is their belief correct? The 
answer is no. 
  It is no cause for criticism that farmers intend to sell 
their products at higher prices for more profit. Past sales of 
grain at unduly low prices have already been noticed by both the 
central and local governments. After the decontrol of grain 
prices, a considerable rise has been registered in grain prices, 
thus enabling the price to keep up with the value. The decision 
of the central authorities to raise the price of grain next year 
is a measure to equalize grain prices and value. As a special 
commodity with great bearing on the state as a whole and on the 
everyday life of the people, grain is subject to market rules, 
and restricted by the risk-enduring capacity of urban grain 
consumers. When grain prices rise drastically, it is necessary 
for the state to adopt economic control and regulation measures, 
or other measures. That is why the State Council has decided to 
draw upon grain stocks to ease prices. Therefore, we have every 
reason to say that people who intend to store up grain and wait 
for a higher price will fail to attain their hope, and it is 
possible that they will not be able to sell their grain at 
today's prices. 
  Peasants in China have always had a strong sense of the 
state 
and the whole situation. Starting next year, China will take 
major steps in reforming the systems of finance, taxation, 
monetary industry, and investment. This set of positive and 
stable programs follows the common rules of the market economy, 
uses the successful experience of advanced countries for 
reference, gives full consideration to China's national 
conditions and today's realities, and tries to take care of the 
interests of all sides in every possible way. Implementation of 
this set of well-coordinated reform programs will enable China 
to take a big step forward in its cause of reform and opening 
up, and in its economic development. However, to put into 
practice all these major reforms, we need to have a sound 
environment, and a stable market remains an important factor. 
The reluctance of peasant brothers to sell grain is exacerbating 
the abnormally sharp price rises, and as a result, the stability 
of the entire market will be weakened, and this situation is 
unfavorable for the state to start its major reforms next year. 
On the contrary, if peasant brothers continue selling their 
grain as they should, they help soothe grain prices and 
stabilize the market. This will help the state to implement its 
major reform measures next year. 
  Peasant brothers, gain a farther and broader vision, do not 
be reluctant to sell grain, and try to carry out production and 
operation in a normal manner.

<F P=106> [Interview with PRC Vice President Rong Yiren by Hajime </F>
Takano, managing editor of INSIDER, in Beijing, date not given; 
from the "Sunday Project" program -- recorded, Rong speaks in 
Chinese with superimposed translation into Japanese] 
  [Text] [Video shows Rong Yiren sitting on a sofa in an 
office] I have done only a little for China's open policy. 
After China began pursuing the open policy, I met from time to 
time with Mr. Deng Xiaoping at meetings of the central 
government. I also had opportunities to meet with Chairman Mao 
Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Zhu De. I met with CPC 
leaders when they needed an urgent discussion with me about the 
Chinese Government's policies. At the time, Mr. Deng asked us to 
make full use of our experiences to contribute to pushing for 
China's open up policy. In particular, Mr. Deng asked me to 
work to attract foreign capitals. I immediately visited 
Germany, France, Switzerland, Japan and the United States and 
Australia. I briefed people there on China's reform and open up 
policy and they responded to my briefing, saying the policy was 
fresh and splendid. 
  I believe that the underlying strength, that has developed 
the China International Trust and Investment Corporation [CITIC] 
as it is today, is China's reform and open up policy. All 
employees of the CITIC have worked hard and foreign 
entrepreneurs have been convinced that there will be no change 
in China's reform and open up policy. I believe that these have 
contributed to the development of the CITIC. 
  [Hajime Takano] Mr. Vice President, I would like to ask what 
role overseas Chinese have played in developing China's economy? 
  [Rong Yiren] I believe that the issue of overseas Chinese is 
a very complicated one. Some overseas Chinese already hold dual 
citizenship. I hope that they will cooperate with China's 
economic development while abiding by laws of countries where 
they live. If those overseas Chinese hope to carry out economic 
and investment activities for China and countries where they 
live, we will of course welcome their hopes. 
  [Takano] The creation of a grand China economic sphere has 
frequently been reported by newspapers and magazines. I would 
like to ask about the possibility of forging such an sphere. 
  [Rong] Taiwan is part of China, and Hong Kong is set to 
revert to the Chinese rule in 1997. Macao, too, will revert to 
Chinese rule in 1999. These regions hope to build a cooperative 
relationship with China. We intend to discuss with people there 
how to develop the regions and China, while cooperating with 
them. We have never talked of a great China economic sphere. I 
do not think that China supports such a concept.

  [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- As the year 1993 is 
about to end, Li Ruihuan, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National 
Committee, and Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National 
Committee recently visited the central organs of the 
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China 
Democratic League, the China Democratic National Construction 
Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the 
Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Zhi 
Gong Dang, the Jiusan Society, and the Taiwan Democratic 
Self-Government League. 
  When Li Ruihuan visited the offices of the central 
committees 
of these democratic parties' he shook hands with their leaders, 
extended his best regards to them, heard briefings about their 
situations, and solicited their views. Applause and laughter 
could frequently be heard wherever he visited. 
  Li Ruihuan had separate heart-to-heart talks with the 
leaders 
of the eight democratic parties' central committees. Speaking 
in a warm and friendly atmosphere, Fei Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei 
Jieqiong, Lu Jiaxi, Li Peiyao, Cai Zimin, Yang Jike, and Hao 
Yichun expressed important views on many issues. 
  Recalling the history of the united front, Li Ruihuan said: 
This year is the centennial of Comrade Mao Zedong. Concerning 
Comrade Mao Zedong's precious legacy, the thinking and theory 
about the united front are particularly important. Comrade Mao 
Zedong gave equal importance to the united front, armed 
struggle, and party building, describing them as the three magic 
weapons. We should thoroughly study this observation. The 
quintessence of Mao Zedong's united front thinking lies in the 
fact that Chinese Communists must strive to unite with their 
allies, unite all forces that can be united with, and mobilize 
all positive factors to form a mammoth revolutionary and 
construction army, and do everything possible to minimize 
hostile forces and problems so as to achieve the historic 
missions of national liberation and national rejuvenation, and 
push the revolutionary and construction cause forward. This 
shining thinking of Comrade Mao Zedong still has important 
guiding significance during the new historical period. 
  Commenting on building a socialist democracy, Li Ruihuan 
said: While we do not reject democracy, we firmly oppose certain 
foreign forces' interference in our internal affairs under the 
banner of "democracy," and we also oppose any act of 
indiscriminately transplanting or copying other countries' 
democratic systems. We always believe that democracy is an 
important benchmark of social progress and an inevitable trend 
of historical development. China's Constitution, the CPC 
Charter, and the report of the 14th National Party Congress have 
all stated that building a prosperous, democratic, and civilized 
socialist modern country is our objective. We also believe that 
the form of democracy of a country as well as the process by 
which it achieves democracy must be determined by the situation 
of this country. Instead of having genuine democracy, there may 
even be chaos if we simply demand democracy without considering 
the country's situation. Facts have proved that the people's 
congress system and the system of multiparty cooperation and 
political consultations under the CPC leadership are socialist 
democratic systems in line with China's situation. We must make 
genuine, effective, and consistent efforts to expedite China's 
democratic construction. 
  Speaking on the roles played by democratic parties, Li 
Ruihuan said: China's reform, opening up, and modernization 
endeavors have now entered a new stage of development, and the 
14th party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee have put forth the grand and formidable 
mission of building a socialist market economic system. If the 
people in our country do not work hard together, this mission 
cannot possibly be accomplished. Since you democratic parties 
have large numbers of talented people and a great pool of 
intellectual resources, and your connections are extensive, the 
roles you play during this historic change are irreplaceable. 
You should and can mobilize the masses you have ties with to 
contribute their strengths, resources, and efforts to the 
gigantic cause of building a socialist market economic system. 
Party committees and governments at all levels should maintain 
close ties with democratic parties and attach importance to 
giving full scope to democratic parties' roles and listen and 
respect their members' views. 
  During the meetings, some democratic party leaders expressed 
views on expanding their organization, replacing the old leading 
groups, and organizational development. They also frankly 
reflected the practical problems about their working conditions. 
Li Ruihuan said: We have stressed long-term coexistence, 
mutual supervision, multiparty cooperation, and political 
consultations; but these things must be predicated on the other 
side's existence and development. Democratic parties' hard work 
is essential for their development. As the leader in multiparty 
cooperation, the CPC also has the responsibility of helping 
democratic parties do a good job in this respect. Li Ruihuan 
pointed out: Respecting and heeding the interests of democratic 
parties and people of all walks of life and performing good and 
practical services for them are concrete united front projects 
which the CPC must do to demonstrate its readiness to serve the 
people wholeheartedly, which is the objective of the CPC, and 
these projects are also important means to enable the united 
front to become more cohesive and to have greater appeal under 
the new situation. All CPC committees must consider it their 
responsibility to assist democratic parties improve their 
working conditions and solve their practical problems. The 
purpose of our visit is to establish ties with you [ren men 6126 
7024], seek your advice, have heart-to-heart talks with you, and 
serve you. Party leaders at all levels must perform more good 
and practical services for democratic parties by demonstrating 
the communists' broadmindedness and high sense of responsibility.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Xu Zugen (1776 4371 2704) and YUNNAN </F>
RIBAO reporter Luo Jie (5012 2638)] 
  [Text] Kunming, 24 Dec (XINHUA) -- During an inspection 
tour of Yunnan, Hu Jintao, Standing Committee member of the 
Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC 
Central Committee, emphasized that it is imperative to attach 
great importance to strengthening and improving party 
construction, to bring into play the party's role as the core of 
leadership, and to steadfastly build up the party in the process 
of establishing a socialist market economic structure while 
implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress 
and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
concentrating efforts on promoting economic construction and 
ensuring a good job in reform and opening up. 
  From 16 to 24 December, Comrade Hu Jintao, accompanied by Pu 
Chaozhu, secretary of the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee, and 
provincial governor He Zhiqiang, inspected enterprises in 
Dehong, Yuxi, and Kunming; visited the development zones and 
open ports in Ruili and Wanding; and called on farm households, 
veteran party members and cadres in ethnic minority villages and 
urban neighborhoods as well as ethnic minority teachers in Luxi. 
While in Kunming, he listened to briefings by leaders of the 
provincial party committee and provincial government, and spoke 
at a meeting with members of the first study class on Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, which was 
attended by leading cadres at and above the county level in 
Yunnan. 
  Hu Jintao said that from what he had seen and heard over the 
previous few days, he was impressed with Yunnan's great change 
and rapid progress over the past 15 years. He said: The 
province is full of vitality, and enjoys high economic growth, 
social and political stability, greater unity of nationalities, 
and an improved livelihood for its people. All of these prove 
the correctness of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as the party's 
basic line, principles, and policies which have been formulated 
under the guidance of this theory. They also testify that the 
Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial government 
have proceeded from the actual condition in the province in 
resolutely and earnestly implementing a series of policy 
decisions and plans adopted by the party Central Committee, and 
that party organizations in Yunnan are full of fighting spirit. 
He exhorted party organizations at all levels and cadres and 
people at large, to be guided by the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, comprehensively 
implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and 
the Third Plenary Session, to seize the opportunity, deepen 
reform, and accelerate development, thereby pushing Yunnan's 
work in all fields to new heights. 
  During his tour of Yunnan, Hu Jintao studied and 
familiarized 
himself, in particular, with the issue of further strengthening 
and improving party construction in the process of expediting 
the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. In 
this connection, he attended and spoke at a discussion in 
Kunming with directors of the organization departments of the 
provincial party committee and party committees of some 
autonomous prefectures and cities directly under the provincial 
government. 
  He said: The organizational line must be dictated by, and 
must serve the political line. In conducting work related to 
party building, it is necessary to bear in mind the overall 
situation of socialist modernization and carry out work in close 
conjunction of the party's central task. The correct 
orientation and guiding ideology for party building should be to 
constantly strengthen and improve party construction while 
implementing the party's basic line and carrying out the party's 
basic task. In conducting work related to party building, we 
should continue to take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line as our guide. According to the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee and the requirements set by Comrade Jiang 
Zemin in his recent speeches, we should focus our attention on 
the central task of economic construction, and work hard to 
adapt ourselves to the new situation of deepening reform and 
expediting development -- especially the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure -- by further emancipating 
our minds, persisting in seeking truth from facts, and actively 
studying new circumstances and exploring new ways to solve new 
problems. We should conscientiously uphold the party's 
character as the vanguard of the working class and the 
fundamental goal of serving the people wholeheartedly by 
comprehensively improving the party ideologically, 
organizationally, and in its style of work; and by further 
strengthening the rallying power, appeal, and fighting spirit of 
all party organizations to promote reform, development and 
stability, thereby bringing into better play the party's role as 
the core of leadership. 
  Discussing the main tasks of party building, Hu Jintao 
said: We should organize party cadres and members to study 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and 
further arm the entire party membership with the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should 
continue to pay keen attention to improving the competence of 
leading bodies at all levels; make determined efforts to 
strengthen grass-roots party organizations; and carry out the 
anti-corruption drive in a thoroughgoing and sustained manner. 
  He emphasized: Diligently studying and mastering the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to enhance 
the entire party membership's theoretical understanding of 
Marxism is the ideological guarantee for accomplishing the 
party's great historic mission in the new era, as well as the 
most important task in party building. So far, a good beginning 
has been made in studying the theory of socialism with Chinese 
characteristics by all party members. We should continue to pay 
keen attention to the study by leading cadres, and should urge 
them to increase their awareness in study and to further 
integrate theory with practice. The pressing task at the moment 
is, by combining the study of Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping with the party Central Committee's 
decision on establishing a socialist market economy, to further 
encourage emancipation of the mind by cadres, and increase their 
understanding of the pertinence and urgency in initiating a 
brand new economic structure in China, thereby firing their 
enthusiasm for reform and building up their confidence in 
improving work in all fields. 
  Urging all party committees to constantly strengthen their 
leadership over party building, Hu Jintao said: The key to 
accomplishing the various difficult tasks in the nineties and 
advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics lies in an effective party leadership. To 
further improve the party, it is of crucial importance that all 
party committees conduct work in an earnest and responsible 
manner. The principle that "the party administers party 
affairs" must be implemented through, first and foremost, the 
handling of party affairs by all party committees and their top 
leaders.

  [By RENMIN RIBAO correspondent Mao Lei (3029 4320) and 
XINHUA correspondent Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Dec (XINHUA) -- Ren Jianxin, member of 
the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and president of 
the Supreme People's Court, said today the basic tasks for all 
levels of the people's courts in 1994 will be: to continue to 
severely crack down on serious criminal activities, guided by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and by the guidelines set forth at the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to do 
an even better job on trying major and important cases, 
particularly major economic criminal cases; to vigorously 
regulate economic relationships; to protect the legitimate 
rights and interests of citizens, corporations, and other 
organizations in a down-to-earth manner; to strictly enforce the 
law; to raise the level of judicial work; to help maintain 
social stability; to promote a clean administration building; 
and to expedite the establishment of a socialist market economy. 
To put it briefly, courts need to raise their prestige by 
seriously cracking down on crime, to produce results in handling 
major and important cases, and to achieve major progress in 
regulating economic relationships; they also need to raise the 
level of judicial work in a comprehensive manner. 
  Ren Jianxin proposed the above tasks today at the opening of 
the National Conference of the Presidents of the People's Higher 
Courts. Ren Jianxin noted next year will be a critical one for 
achieving all-round progress and for making major breakthroughs 
in reforming the economic system. Deepening reform, expediting 
development, and maintaining stability are the priority and 
important tasks for the entire party and for people throughout 
the nation. 
  Ren Jianxin said social stability is the necessary premise 
and guarantee for developing the economy. As a whole, the 
current situation is good; however, factors for instability 
still remain. The social order is still grim. The increase in 
the number of major vicious criminal cases and the terrible 
social order are "hotpoint" issues which cause great concern 
among the masses. 
  Therefore, Ren Jianxin pointed out the need for local courts 
to continue to persist in their severe crackdown and to severely 
crackdown on those criminal activities which seriously endanger 
the national security, sabotage social stability, and disrupt 
social order. It is necessary to timely launch special 
anti-crime campaigns in areas where criminals run rampant and to 
engage in concentrated crackdowns against criminal activities 
which arouse the people's indignation. We must swiftly hand 
down heavy sentences to criminals and should never be 
soft-hearted towards them. The purpose of the severe crackdown 
is to create momentum, to raise our prestige, to produce marked 
social effects, and to help create a peaceful and satisfactory 
social environment for the masses. 
  While engaging in the severe crackdown, Ren Jianxin also 
called on court presidents to become more involved in the 
comprehensive management of social order, to creatively spread 
the concept of law among the masses, to sum up the court's work, 
and to vigorously explore new ways for the courts to implement 
the party's mass line under the new situation. 
  Ren Jianxin stressed that the government will continue to 
exert great efforts in reform next year. He said a new 
breakthrough is expected to be made in reform next year, 
particularly in establishing a modern enterprise system and 
market structure as well as in the areas of finance, planning, 
investment, and foreign investment. Both the interest pattern 
of the old system as well as the various unreasonable interest 
patterns which developed in the course of system changes are 
expected to undergo great changes. Therefore, new contradictions 
and confusion are bound to rise. 
  To adapt to the changes in and readjustment of the pattern 
of 
the state's economic system, he said the courts should achieve 
fresh breakthroughs in economic trial work next year in addition 
to making new progress in civil and administrative trial work. 
They must make still better use of the law as a means to timely 
regulate economic relationships according to law; to standardize 
the behavior of the market economy; to protect legitimate 
competition and fair trade; to help the market thrive; to 
correctly and properly handle the contradictions among the 
people; to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the 
citizens, corporations, and other organizations according to 
law; to directly provide effective legal services for 
establishing a socialist market economy system; and to help 
create an excellent legal environment for the orderly operation 
of the market economy.

Renzhu (2621 0088 0031) and XINHUA correspondent Li Niangui 
(2621 1628 6311)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 23 Dec (XINHUA) -- At the Second Presidium 
meeting of the 12th Executive Committee of the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions [ACFTU] which ended today, ACFTU 
President Wei Jianxing called on trade unions [TU] at all levels 
to enhance their consciousness of opportunity and their sense of 
the overall situation, and to fulfill the duties of a TU in 
promoting development of the overall situation. 
  Touching on the arrangement for next year's work for the 
ACFTU, Wei Jianxing stressed it is necessary to successfully 
carry out the following five tasks in a down-to-earth manner: 
1) persist in focusing efforts on economic construction and 
treat the promotion of economic development as the central task 
of the TU's; 2) take active part in reform and promote reform 
by laying emphasis on successfully transforming the operating 
mechanisms of state enterprises and establishing a modern 
enterprise system; 3) play an active role in establishing a 
stable labor relationship, in maintaining the legitimate rights 
and interests of staff and workers, and in maintaining social 
and political stability; 4) take more part in legislation and 
policies, and give full play to the role of TU's as a democratic 
channel and in social regulation; and 5) strengthen the building 
of contingents of staff and workers. 
  Wei Jianxing pointed out: In the face of heavy and 
complicated reforms next year, TU's must unite and mobilize the 
broad masses of staff and workers to stand steadfastly in the 
forefront of reform and to vigorously support, participate in, 
and promote reform by laying emphasis on successfully 
transforming the operating mechanisms of state enterprises and 
establishing a modern enterprise system. He said transforming 
the operating mechanisms of state enterprises and establishing a 
modern enterprise system are the basis for the establishment of 
a socialist market economy, the orientation for the reform of 
state enterprises, and the focal point for the next-step assault 
on fortified positions and for our TU work. He believed 
implementation of the fundamental policy -- rely on the working 
class wholeheartedly -- must not change in socialist China. So 
long as the role played by the public ownership of enterprises 
as the principal part remains unchanged, the position of staff 
and workers as the masters of enterprises; their rights to 
exercise democratic management of, democratic participation in, 
and democratic supervision over enterprises through staff and 
workers' congresses and through other forms; and the rights of 
enterprise TU's to represent and maintain the legitimate rights 
and interests of staff and workers, as well as to independently 
conduct work according to laws and according to TU regulations, 
shall remain unchanged no matter how state enterprises' 
operating mechanisms are transformed. 
  Wei Jianxing stated: Stabilizing labor relationships and 
maintaining the legitimate rights and interests of staff and 
workers is an important social responsibility of TU's. There is 
a lot of work to do now. Four points must be stressed: First, 
we must show concern for the livelihood of staff and workers who 
encounter difficulties. Second, we must attach importance to 
production safety. Third, we must maintain the legitimate 
rights and interests of staff and workers of enterprises, and in 
particular, of foreign- invested enterprises and private 
enterprises. Serious infringement on the legitimate rights and 
interests of staff and workers, and even violation of their 
personal rights and insult to their human dignity, have occurred 
from time to time among these enterprises. We must pay close 
attention to such phenomena. Fourth, we must quicken the pace 
of establishing experimental TU's for village and town 
enterprises. He said: TU's represent staff and workers to 
participate in administration of state and social affairs and in 
democratic management and democratic supervision of enterprises 
and institutions. This is a great trust placed by the party in 
TU's, a demand set by staff and workers on them, and a right 
vested by law in them. TU's at all levels must make efforts to 
enhance their law consciousness and must take the initiative to 
successfully fulfill their duties of participation with perfect 
assurance. 
  The presidium meeting opened on 20 December. It was convened 
mainly for the purposes of studying and implementing the 
"Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and determining the ACFTU's major tasks in 1994 in the 
light of the actual conditions of TU work. In addition, it 
heard a report on the investigation of the serious "19 November" 
fire accident at Shenzhen and discussed how to improve TU work 
among foreign-invested enterprises.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (XINHUA) -- Addressing a 
teleconference called by the State Education Commission today to 
discuss educational projects in 1994, Zhu Kaixuan [minister in 
charge of the State Education Commission], pointed out that 1994 
is a year crucial for intensifying educational reform and fully 
implementing the educational "program." Education workers in 
the country, he said, must work hard with higher morale, explore 
with daring, and be brave to do practical work so that 
educational reform and development can reach a higher level. 
  After recalling China's educational development in 1993 in 
his work report, Zhu Kaixuan pointed out: While the situation 
was generally satisfactory, we must realize that the country is 
still confronted with certain educational problems: There is 
insufficient coordination between the reform of the educational 
system on the one hand and economic reform, reform of science 
and technology management, and reform of the political system on 
the other; the shortage of educational budgets has intensified, 
the mechanisms governing educational investment cannot keep pace 
with needs in educational development and needs in various 
social quarters; teachers' pay remains low, and problems 
concerning delinquent salary payments for teachers have not yet 
been fully resolved; in some localities and schools, the ranks 
of teachers are unstable and the rates of school dropouts have 
increased; in some localities and schools of higher education, 
the conditions for educational operations cannot keep pace with 
the rapid increase of students, giving rise to new managerial 
problems; and there is also the problem concerning inadequate 
macroscopic regulation and control for educational reform. We 
must deal with these problems as quickly as possible through 
deepening educational reform. 
  On the 1994 assignments, Zhu Kaixuan pointed out: The 
nation's educational development for the time to come will focus 
on basic education, especially the "two basic projects" -- basic 
universalization of the nine-year compulsory educational system 
and the project of basically wiping out illiteracy among 
growups. We must firmly implement the nine-year compulsory 
educational system as the law requires. On the basis of the 
State Education Commission's principles and objectives that 
there should be regional planning, difference guidance for 
different projects, and plans for step-by- step implementation, 
all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly 
under the central government's jurisdiction must also draw up 
specific nine-year compulsory educational development plans that 
can be implemented by all counties and townships step by step. 
Meanwhile, we must also study and draw up policies and measures 
for popularizing compulsory education for specific numbers of 
years in remote, impoverished regions. Schools of higher 
education must fully implement the general policy that "their 
sizes must be larger, their quality must be better, their 
structures must be more rational, and their efficiency must be 
noticeably higher." The enrollment and growth of schools of 
higher education must be appropriate. They should give priority 
to improving their quality, restructuring their organization, 
improving their efficiency, and improving their operating 
conditions. We should arouse the enthusiasm of schools operated 
by central departments and local authorities to set up schools 
through forming all types of partnership programs so that 
significant headway can be achieved this year in reforming the 
system governing educational operations by government 
departments and the system governing educational investment. 
Provincial, regional, and municipal authorities should be given 
greater power gradually to make overall planning for the 
development of higher education in areas under their 
jurisdiction. Schools of higher education, and specialized 
secondary vocational training schools must energetically 
expedite the process of reforming their systems governing 
enrollment, collection of fees, and graduates' job assignment. 
Priority should be given to replacing the system whereby the 
state is responsible for students' tuitions and post-graduate 
assignment with a system whereby the students have to pay their 
own tuitions and have to find jobs themselves; and to improving 
the systems governing scholarships, student loans, and 
work-study programs. 
  Zhu Kaixuan said: For vocational education, we must 
encourage all trades and professions to work with people in all 
social quarters to set up schools through forming partnerships; 
and enterprises, in particular, must fulfill their obligations 
in this regard. We must have stronger teacher-training projects 
and we must improve the system for hiring teachers on the basis 
of their performance. We should encourage the use of the dual 
credentials system [shuang zheng zhi 7175 6086 0455] and improve 
all services facilitating the development of vocational 
education. We should assign some major vocational training 
colleges to set up professional training classes on an 
experimental basis to promote reform and construction of 
professional universities. We should actively develop all kinds 
of vocational education for students that graduate from junior 
and senior middle schools. Meanwhile, we should continue to 
designate certain counties to experiment with educational reform 
and designate certain townships to demonstrate the "prairie fire 
program;" and then we should pay attention to promoting their 
experiences in other areas to promote "unified planning among 
three forms of education" [san jiao tong chou 0005 2403 4827 
4693] and integration of agricultural production, scientific 
research, and education. We should also continue to make sure 
that cities and enterprises designated to carry out experimental 
comprehensive educational reform will accomplish their 
assignments. For adult education, we should continue to give 
priority to on-the-job training and follow-up education and 
encourage all trades and establishments to set up and improve 
their on-the-job training programs, certification programs, 
qualification test and evaluation programs, and follow-up 
training programs. Townships, towns, and villages must properly 
operate their literacy and technical schools offering technical 
training. They should implement the "green certificate" system 
to intensify the training for workers of township and town 
enterprises. Radio, television, correspondence, and other means 
should be used to provide follow-up post-high school education 
for people in society, especially those in medium and small 
cities and remote areas. 
  Speaking on ensuring educational investment and raising 
teachers' pay, Zhu Kaixuan said: This year, the state has 
allotted a noticeably higher budget for educational institutions 
whose operations fall under the national budget. We should set 
up and gradually increase the special funds for central, 
provincial, county, and township governments for supporting 
compulsory education. Financial and taxation authorities should 
come up with, as quickly as possible, the proportion of 
educational fees to be collected in cities and rural areas after 
tax reform, as well as the measures for collecting those fees. 
Provincial governments and central departments and committees 
should work together to readjust and standardize the amounts of 
tuitions and miscellaneous fees to be collected in all types of 
schools. Based on the principle for unifying administrative and 
financial powers, we should study and come up with views about 
administrative educational departments joining governments of 
corresponding levels in budgeting educational funds. We should 
study ways to improve rural areas' measures for raising 
educational funds, earnestly solve the problems about investment 
in building middle and primary school buildings, set up 
educational trust and investment companies, and make 
preparations for setting up the "China Foundation for 
Educational Development." He said: We must earnestly implement 
the plan for reforming teachers' pay scales, central and local 
authorities must both take effective measures to speed up 
construction of teacher housing. Those areas which still have 
not paid teachers' salaries must be seriously handled lawfully 
according to their situations. Mechanisms for guarding against 
delinquent payment of teachers' salaries must be devised. 
  Zhu Kaixuan said: Leading comrades of central authorities 
have agreed in principle to call a national educational 
conference during the first half of this year to mobilize the 
whole party and the whole society to implement the strategy of 
giving priority to educational development and implement the 
"program" [for educational development]. The conference will 
come up with additional views and measures for China's 
educational reform and development.

  [Text] Beijing, January 11 (XINHUA) -- China is to lift at 
least four million out of illiteracy this year, a top official 
has vowed. 
  Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of the State Education 
Commission, said in a national telephone meeting on education 
here today that, if programs go according to this plan, China 
will be able to give all its grown-ups the ability to read. 
  For several years, China has strictly and firmly rescued 
about four million from illiteracy annually. 
  The illiteracy rate for the total population has dropped 
from 
80 percent in 1949 to 16 percent today, accounting for the young 
and adults. 
  "Elementary education will be the key for all national 
education in the coming years," Zhu said. "We will map out 
measures to help poor regions popularize compulsory education 
and revise the current examination methods on anti-illiteracy 
progress." 
  About 90 percent of Chinese illiterates are rural people, 
with the majority being females living in poverty-stricken areas. 
  Yet, Zhu emphasized other aspects of education, which will 
consolidate anti-illiteracy achievements, such as professional 
education, adult education and higher learning. 
  A new mechanism will be gradually introduced on college 
campuses, which requires more students to pay for tuition and 
choose jobs by themselves, he revealed. 
  And the Education Commission will draft more than 20 laws 
and 
regulations this year to provide more legal protection for the 
sector, including the law of education and the regulation for 
foreigners to run schools in China, the minister added.

  [Text] Beijing, January 11 (XINHUA) -- The State Education 
Commission has submitted a draft plan to the State Council for 
an increase in China's education funding, a top official 
announced. 
  Zhu Kaixuan, minister of the State Education Commission, 
said 
at a national education telephone meeting here today that the 
plan is based on an evaluation of the total financial need in 
education during 1993-2000. 
  He said that his commission has discussed with the Finance 
Ministry about issues of collecting education taxes from social 
services and exempting taxes on school-run factories, which will 
fall in line with finance reform this year. 
  Insufficient education funding, which has dogged China's 
educational progress for years, remains one of the major 
problems. Another problem is low teacher pay. 
  Zhu said that China will set up an education trust and 
investment company as well as an education development fund 
shortly, in an effort to solve these problems. Meanwhile, an 
evaluation system will be established to monitor and prevent 
misappropriation of teaching money. 
  "The proportion of education investment prescribed in the 
state budget must see an obvious increase," he urged, also 
stressing the establishment and increase of a special allocation 
at the central and local financial levels for supporting 
compulsory education. 
  He called on provincial governments and central ministries 
to 
determine suitable standards for school tuition fees, which are 
now too freely set. 
  "We will study the idea to let education departments join 
the 
education budget-making process in the relevant governments, 
improve the policy to collect money for developing rural 
education, and build a mechanism to finance the building of 
classrooms," he said. 
  As to raising teachers' salaries, he noted that a reform 
will 
soon be proposed by the Education Commission and the Personnel 
Ministry. And severe punishments will be imposed on those who 
delay paying teachers' salaries.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Jan (XINHUA) -- A spokesman for the 
State Education Commission recently addressed a news conference, 
saying: New progress has been made recently in solving the 
problem of middle and primary school teachers' wages in arrears, 
a problem which the whole society is concerned about. The total 
amount of the middle and primary school teachers' wages in 
arrears across the country dropped to 309 million yuan at the 
end of 1993 from 1.43 billion yuan in September 1993. The State 
Education Commission has called on all localities to pay more 
attention to solving the problem and pay all the arrears before 
the Spring Festival. 
  According to reports from various localities, teachers' 
wages 
have never been in arrears in Beijing Municipality and Tibet 
Region; 17 provinces municipalities, and autonomous regions -- 
Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, Gansu, Yunnan, Jilin, Sichuan, 
Qinghai, Hainan, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Guangxi, 
Jiangsu, Guizhou, Shandong, and Ningxia -- have paid or 
basically paid the teachers' wages in arrears; and arrears of 
teachers' wages still exist to a varying degree in 10 provinces. 
The arrears exceed 10 million yuan in Henan, Hubei, Anhui, 
Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Hunan, Shaanxi, and Fujian. Henan 
Province owes the most -- 120 million yuan. 
  The spokesman said: The party Central Committee and the 
State Council are deeply concerned about the middle and primary 
school teachers' wages in arrears and attach great importance to 
the problem. At the national rural work conference held in 
October last year, Premier Li Peng pointed out that it is 
impermissible to owe arrears of teachers' wages, and he called 
on all localities to take effective measures to solve the 
problem. Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, has 
successively written the governors or party committee 
secretaries of Hebei, Heilongjiang, Guangxi, Hubei, Henan, 
Hunan, Jiangsu, and Sichuan to speed up the solution to the 
problem. The party committees and people's governments of 
various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have 
made great efforts to pay the arrears of teachers' wages, 
despite financial difficulties. The principal party and 
government leaders of many provinces are personally taking a 
hand in the matter. They have instructed that wherever the 
teachers' wages are in arrears, the wages of government office 
cadres should also be withheld; and that if the arrears of 
teachers' wages are caused by diversion of budget fund to 
building unauthorized projects or buying automobiles, such 
diversion must be resolutely stopped. Henan Province owes more 
than 100 million yuan in arrears of teachers' wages. In 
addition to adopting other measures, the provincial government 
appropriated a special funding of 43 million yuan in late 
December last year. Moreover, the eighth session of the fifth 
provincial party committee has made some arrangements and 
demanded that all necessary measures be taken to open up sources 
of funds so as to pay all the teachers' wages in arrears.

Tzu-ching (7812 5261 0079): "CPC Plans To Set Up `General Staff 
Headquarters' of Party, Government, and Army"] 
  [Text] In the middle of August, the Political Bureau 
discussed the membership composition and work nature of the 
planned "CPC Central Committee Policy Consultation Office." 
This will be the highest "advisory" organ serving the Political 
Bureau, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and 
the State Military Commission when they formulate policies and 
handle important issues at home and abroad; it will be led by 
the Political Bureau and be directly responsible to the 
Political Bureau, the State Council, and the CPC Central 
Military Commission. 
<H3>  Wan Li and Gu Mu Suggest Establishing a "Staff Headquarters" 
of the Party, Government, and Army </H3>
  News from Zhongnanhai: A central-level "staff headquarters" 
of the party, government, and army is imminent. 
  It will be the highest "advisory" organ serving the 
Political 
Bureau, the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, the State 
Council, the CPC Central Military Commission, and the State 
Military Commission when they formulate policies and handle 
important issues at home and abroad. 
  According to information, the idea of establishing such a 
consultative organ was first proposed to Deng Xiaoping by Wan Li 
and Gu Mu after the Eighth National People's Congress. At that 
time, thought was given to inviting some retired party, 
government, and army officials to join the organ. Deng Xiaoping 
thought it was a good idea to establish such an organ but did 
not agree with the idea of inviting retired persons to join it. 
He raised five points: First, the organ should play a role in 
assisting work and proposing strategies; second, it must be led 
by the Political Bureau; third, members should be strong and 
experienced and they must include some comrades from the 
Political Bureau Standing Committee and the Central Military 
Commission; fourth, no old and retired persons should join it 
because it must not have the nature of the Central Advisory 
Commission; and fifth, the work and functions of the organ are 
to be completely internal. 
<H3>  "CPC Central Committee Policy Consultation Office" To 
Consist of One Office and Six Groups </H3>
  In the middle of August, the Political Bureau discussed the 
membership composition and work nature of the planned "CPC 
Central Committee Policy Consultation Office" (another 
suggestion was that it should be called the "Policy Leadership 
Office). It was decided that the office should be located 
within the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and that 80 senior 
and middle-ranking cadres should be transferred from the CPC 
Central Committee; the State Council ministries, commissions, 
and offices; and the CPC Central Military Commission to 
participate in the work. Thereafter, the Political Bureau 
thought that the organ should not be too clumsy and in principle 
they should all hold the posts concurrently and no duties or 
titles will be created for them. It was initially decided that 
the idea should lead to the establishment of one office and six 
groups. 
  One office: The CPC Central Committee Policy Consultation 
Office. 
  Six Groups: First -- party affairs work group; second -- 
economic construction work group; third -- social work group; 
fourth -- national defense work group; fifth -- international 
relations work group; and sixth -- planning work group. 
<H3>  Fifteen Incumbent Senior Party, Government, and Army 
Personnel Will Participate in the Work </H3>
  Since 15 November, active work has been done to prepare for 
this organ. According to information, 15 incumbent senior 
party, government, and army personnel are participating in the 
work, including Qiao Shi, Hu Jintao, Zou Jiahua, Zhang Zhen, Yu 
Yongbo, Wang Ruilin, Tao Siju, Ceng Qinghong, and Qi Huaiyuan. 
Qiao Shi, Hu Jintao, Zou Jiahua, and Zhang Zhen will 
participate in the work of the office. 
  It has been alleged that during the period of the Third 
Plenary Session, Jiang Zemin once disclosed the message that, 
after discussions and studies by the Political Bureau, it has 
been initially decided that a CPC Central Committee Policy 
Consultation Office will be established, led by the Political 
Bureau; the office will be directly responsible to the Political 
Bureau, the State Council, and the CPC Central Military 
Commission. 
  At the senior level, some people think that such a move will 
cause things to overlap and make the already redundant central 
organ even more redundant. Some people express support for the 
establishment of this "general staff headquarters," saying that 
it can play a liaison role between the party, government, and 
army, and offer plans and strategies on the macrofoundation 
incorporating the party, government, and army, to assist the 
central leadership in formulating policies and handling 
important issues at home and abroad.

<F P=106> [By Yu Keping (0205 0668 1627): "Tentative Views on </F>
Declining Authority of Government"] 
  [Text] A mayor once ordered relevant departments to clean, 
within a definite time, a polluted brook in the city proper 
which stank to high heaven. However, the time limit was reached 
and the brook remained as stinking as before. Though a certain 
industrial and commercial inspection department makes great 
efforts in carrying out struggles against illegal hawkers, the 
latter continue to engage in swindling, cheating, and bullying. 
In the face of court decisions that have already taken effect, 
some plaintiffs still refuse to act accordingly. Though a ban 
has been explicitly imposed on businesses run by government 
organs, "renamed companies" still enjoy a flourishing business. 
Many departments follow the practice by which "policies are 
issued at higher levels while countermeasures are adopted at 
lower levels," and that "local policies and private treasuries 
can be found everywhere." All these are, in the terms of 
political science, different expressions of the loss of 
government authority. 
  In today's China, the loss of government authority has posed 
a serious threat to the smooth progress of reform, opening up, 
and modernization drive. To counter such a situation, some 
leading comrades of local governments believe that safeguarding 
government authority, especially the authority of the central 
government, has become an urgent task at the present stage. 
  Generally speaking, the loss of government authority takes 
the following three forms. The first form is refusal to act in 
accordance with the law. Law is a concentrated expression of 
government authority, and violations of the law mean a direct 
disregard of government authority. Punishment handed down to 
lawbreakers is a remedial measure to stop the loss of authority; 
yet if no punishment was given to violators of the law, or if 
the punishment is not heavy enough to prevent the reoccurrence 
of lawbreaking activities, government authority will suffer a 
net loss. The second form is failure to strictly enforce orders 
and prohibitions, which means that government policies cannot be 
carried out in an effective way. Policies of the government are 
an expression of the will of the government. Any deliberate 
delay, evasion, perfunctoriness, conclusion with nothing 
definite, ignorance, and intentional antagonism all mean 
violations and disrespect for government authority. The third 
form is the misrepresentation of government policies during the 
course of implementation. People who are in charge of 
implementation purposely distort the original meaning of 
government policies and make them more favorable to partial or 
individual interests. Under such circumstances, either 
government authority is retained in name but lost in reality, or 
part of government authority is retained while the rest is lost. 
  The loss of government authority is a common political 
disease which is, in essence, refusal to act in accordance with 
the law and failure to strictly enforce orders and prohibitions. 
The consequences of this disease are more disastrous than the 
aftermath of having no policies and rules to follow. This is 
because this disease will dampen the efficiency of the 
administration; intensify contradictions between the government 
and citizens; weaken the ruling foundation of the government and 
the political recognition of the people; and finally lead to 
political splits, integration of the political power, and 
political turbulences in the society. Under such circumstances, 
what should we do to effectively check a huge loss of government 
authority? To answer this question, we should first find out 
the root causes leading to the loss of government authority. 
The source of loss of government authority, in the final 
analysis, can be traced along the following three lines: 
  First, the deterrent force of decision makers. Whether or 
not government policies can be carried out is, to a great 
extent, determined by the deterrent force possessed by 
decisionmaking organs. It is from the following two aspects 
that such a deterrent is generated: The first aspect is the 
legal mandatory means adopted by government organs. This means 
that appropriate punishment should be handed down on those who 
refuse to show proper obedience. If decisionmaking organs fail 
to give appropriate punishment to those who refuse to show 
obedience, its deterrence force will disappear gradually. The 
second aspect is the legality of decision makers or, in other 
words, recognition of decision makers by those who are asked to 
show obedience. If people who are asked to show obedience do 
not consider the decision maker as the right person to represent 
their interest, the former will become rebellious and estranged 
from the latter; and when the right moment comes, they will 
disobey or violate the rules and regulations of the government. 
  Second, the calculation of "cost-interest" by those who are 
asked to show obedience. During the course of implementing the 
policies and rules of the government, those who take political 
action generally have a sense for "cost-interest." If one is 
not punished for his disobedience of rules and regulations, or 
if his interests loss resulted from punishment for his 
disobedience is smaller than the interest he gains from his 
disobedience, he will tend to choose disobedience. On the 
contrary, if his interest loss resulted from punishment for his 
disobedience is bigger than what he gains from his disobedience 
of rules and regulations, he will often choose obedience. 
  Third, the quality of policies. The quality of policies has 
a great bearing on whether or not policies can be implemented 
effectively. Generally speaking, we will find it hard to 
effectively carry out policies, rules, and regulations under the 
following four situations: 1) Incorrect policies. These 
incorrect policies will, beyond any doubt, cause damage to the 
interest of the whole. Therefore, though incorrect policies may 
be forced through, the results will be nothing but temporary. 
2) Different policies drawn up by different decisionmaking 
departments. Facing different policies, rules, and regulations 
put forward by different organs on a same issue, subordinate 
organs will often find it hard to make a choice, for fear that 
they may follow one policy and lose sight of another. 3) The 
unpredictable changes in policies. If decisionmaking 
departments issue an order in the morning and rescind it in the 
evening, its subordinate organs will adopt a wait-and-see 
attitude instead of carrying the order through vigorously and 
speedily. 4) Conflicting policies. When policies, rules, and 
regulations are contradictory or inconsistent, subordinate 
organs will be at a loss as to what to do. 
  A fundamental way of checking the loss of government 
authority is to enhance the legality and deterrent force of 
government departments through political structural reform and 
the building of clean administration, improve the quality of 
policies through democratization and scientification of policy 
decisions, and heighten the political recognition of citizens 
through effective political socialization.

<F P=106> ["Economic Reference Forum" column: "Appropriately Handle </F>
the Relationship Between Reform, Opening Up, and Stability"] 
  [Text] In the process of building a socialist market 
economy, we must always pay attention to properly handling the 
relationship between reform and development on the one hand and 
stability on the other. 
  In implementing the "Decision [of the Third Plenum of the 
14th CPC Central Committee]," we will run into various kinds of 
complicated conditions, various kinds of problems will arise, 
and various kinds of conflicts will take place. 
  Reform has promoted the development of the productive 
forces, 
enabled the economy to develop in a good direction, and improved 
the people's living standards. However, the reform itself will 
inevitably involve a redistribution of interests, or a 
redistribution of powers and interests if you like, and this 
will involve the interests of many people. When enterprises 
cannot disburse wages or borrow money to disburse wages, this is 
a problem of the distribution of interests and will cause 
trouble if it is not properly handled, and it is a real problem. 
  No stability, no nothing. Without a stable social 
environment, nothing can be accomplished. Stability is the 
social foundation for implementing the "Decision." 
  Some cadres lack an adequate understanding of the need for 
stability at this time. We have indeed developed these years, 
but we should prepare for danger in time of peace and have a 
sober understanding of various conditions. 
  In conclusion, without a stable situation there is no point 
in talking about anything. 
  So-called stability mainly refers to emotional stability 
among the masses. The masses are the main body carrying out 
reform, reform is a revolution, and the masses are the driving 
force behind reform. We must listen to the opinions and calls 
of the masses and respect their innovative spirit. Without the 
support of the masses, even a better decision will not work.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "More Investigation and Study, Less </F>
Subjectivism--Second Commentary on New Style in New Year"] 
  [Text] More investigation and study, less subjectivism is 
an important point stressed repeatedly by Comrade Jiang Zemin 
for improving leadership style. 
  Under the new situation of reform and opening up in recent 
years, many leading cadres have taken note of going deep into 
the realities of life, doing investigations and studies, and 
creatively implementing central principles and policies in 
connection with practice, and they have scored gratifying 
achievements. However, there are also some comrades who have 
slackened their efforts to conduct investigation and study. 
According to these people, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics has outlined the 
blueprint, the party's basic line has illuminated the direction, 
and reform and opening up have been practiced for more than a 
decade. Hence, no major problems are likely to crop up. 
Believing that they are proficient and familiar with their 
jobs, they are not willing to go deep into the realities of life 
and maintain contacts with the masses. Instead of doing 
meticulous investigation and study, they are satisfied with 
reading documents and listening to reports. They are used to 
sitting in offices, issuing orders, and willfully making policy 
decisions. Consequently, this gives rise to subjectivism, or 
sticking to old conventions which lag behind the masses and the 
situation, or blindly seeking advanced growth which is beyond 
one's capacity. 
  To prevent the occurrence of these problems, it is necessary 
to conduct investigation and study in a thorough manner and to 
guard against subjectivism. The year 1994 is a very crucial one 
for China's reform, opening up, and modernization program. The 
pace of reform has been accelerated and its endurance is great. 
As the establishment of a socialist market economic system is a 
brand new topic, leading cadres are pupils in this issue. We 
should correctly understand and handle relations between reform, 
development, and stability; correctly understand and handle the 
two different types of contradictions; earnestly study the form 
of expression and development trend of the contradictions among 
the people in the new situation; and particularly take note of 
the new problems arising from the adjustment of the relations 
and structure of interests in the course of deepened reform. 
Hence, it is necessary to go deep into the realities of life, 
conduct investigation and study, apply Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to 
analyze and resolve problems, overcome difficulties, and forge 
ahead. 
  To do a good job of investigation and study, the most 
important thing is to attentively listen to the voice of the 
masses and have a comprehensive understanding of the true 
situation of the grass-roots levels. It will be impossible for 
leaders to have a clear idea of the true situation of the 
grass-roots levels by just scratching the surface, doing things 
perfunctorily, and making cursory observations. Investigation 
and study require a correct guiding ideology and prevention of 
subjectivism. Taking several bags with them before conducting 
investigation and study, some cadres are good at carefully 
watching the situation. They offer whatever the higher 
authorities want and regard whatever their superior say as the 
truth. Therefore, it is necessary to proceed from objective 
reality in conducting investigation. Besides going to the rich 
and advanced regions, they should also go to the poor and 
backward regions. Besides listening to good-sounding words, they 
should also listen to words and advice unpleasant to the ear. 
Instead of going to the grass-roots levels with a predetermined 
conclusion and framework, they should insist on the practice of 
drawing conclusions after conducting investigation and study, 
which should be based on scientific representation. It is 
necessary to seriously analyze and study the new problems and 
experiences occurring in reform and opening up. We should not 
hastily negate the newly emerging things which conform to reform 
and development or speak highly of and laud erroneous behavior 
which goes counter to the socialist market economy. It is 
necessary to seriously analyze the root cause of the negative 
phenomena cropping in the course of reform and to propose ways 
to resolve them. Through investigation, it is necessary to 
study how to integrate the line, principles, and policies of the 
central authorities with the practice of the local departments 
and units and continue to create a new situation. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong had a motto: "No investigation, no right 
to speak." While doing revolution and construction in the past, 
we had benefited a lot from seriously conducting investigation 
and study, and also suffered from subjectivism. We must firmly 
bear in mind both positive and negative experiences. Now the 
enthusiasm of all localities is running high and a number of 
localities have proposed new ideas for implementing the ideas of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. 
This is indeed gratifying. However, we must have grounds for 
all this as well as resolute measures for implementation. As 
the great cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics will encounter numerous tasks and changes with 
each passing day, leading cadres at all levels shoulder heavy 
responsibility. Under such circumstances, it is particularly 
necessary to sincerely take practice as the classroom and the 
masses as teachers, constantly improve work style and methods, 
and remarkably accomplish tasks.

"Maintain Independence and Keep the Initiative in Our Own Hands 
Is Our Standpoint"] 
  [Text] The international and domestic situation today is 
much different from that in the days of Comrade Mao Zedong; 
nevertheless, recalling and reviewing his diplomatic thinking 
and strategy, we find that it remains very significant in 
guiding our work today. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong's diplomatic strategy had a different 
focus in different periods based on the different situations and 
conditions; however, the basics were persistent and the most 
conspicuous point was: "Maintain independence, take the 
initiative in our own hands, and rely on our own efforts." If 
overthrowing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism 
and founding the PRC were Comrade Mao Zedong's immortal 
historical feats, then maintaining state sovereignty and 
territorial integrity in the wake of the PRC's founding, while 
adhering to maintaining independence under whatever 
circumstances, was another of his brilliant accomplishments. 
  When the People's Liberation Army crossed the Chang Jiang, 
he 
resolutely issued an order to fire at a naval vessel flying a 
foreign flag, which had attempted to make trouble. In the early 
days of the PRC founding, the U.S. Army started a war at China's 
gates; at that time, China's economic strength was very weak as 
all tasks which had been neglected were being undertaken. 
However, he vigorously advocated sending volunteers to Korea 
and defeated the aggressors through joint efforts with the 
Korean People's Army, safeguarding our national security. 
Later, with indomitable spirit, he led the Chinese people to 
withstand the imperialist economic blockade for 20 years. 
Because of chauvinism in the international communist movement, 
Comrade Mao Zedong thoroughly resisted any attempt to injure 
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, was before or 
after the PRC's founding. Especially during the three years of 
natural calamities, he was bold enough to refute in stern 
speeches the unreasonable demands of the Soviet leader at that 
time. We cannot help but admire him when we recall things past. 
  Under the new historical conditions, how should we view and 
grasp the principle to "maintain independence, take the 
initiative in our own hands, and rely on our own efforts?" To 
answer this, it is imperative to understand the characteristics 
of the world today. The world is precisely as it is and actually 
exists. However, observed from different angles, people will 
obtain different impressions and draw different conclusions. 
Should we view the world from the angle of North-South 
relations, we can have a clear picture of the attempts and 
momentum of the North manipulating the South. Western developed 
countries always try to transform the world in the shape of 
their own features, while attempting to unify and standardize 
the world population of 5 billion using their own value 
concepts. In recent years, the G-7 Summits have discussed not 
only their own economic relations but have also increasingly 
issued orders, right and left, regarding world affairs. 
Economic sanctions have become a magic wand in their hands, 
which they often use to attack others. This is a new condition 
which has surfaced in the wake of the termination of the bipolar 
pattern. 
  On the issue of sovereignty, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has 
always 
been rock solid saying: "Maintain independence, take the 
initiative in our own hands, and rely on our own efforts has 
always been, and will continue to be, our standpoint." He also 
said: "All foreign countries should stop expecting China to 
become their vassal state and stop expecting China to swallow 
any bitter fruit that injures China's interests." He made these 
remarks 11 years ago and they still remind us of Comrade Mao 
Zedong's boldness of vision. Today, Western countries have not 
stopped their efforts to "change" us, nor have they stopped 
their activities in trying to disintegrate China. A new "theory" 
has surfaced in the West which says that the world has now 
become a global village; some issues, such as human rights and 
the environment, have transcended national boundaries and 
sovereignty. Such argument has failed to gain prominence and 
has been forced to retreat somewhat because of resistance from 
China and other Third World countries. It has been reported 
that Locher [luo shi 5012 0087], U.S. assistant secretary of 
defense, recently stated that the Clinton administration would 
be pleased to see a "powerful, unified, and prosperous" China. 
We would certainly welcome such a statement should they really 
mean it. However, we have always advocated not just hearing 
people's words but also seeing people's actions. Until they 
make a substantial move along this line, we should never relax 
our vigilance. 
  Vigilance and precautions are indispensable; more 
importantly, however, we should develop our productive forces. 
Last summer, the United States unreasonably checked the cargo 
hold of our freighter Yinghe but found nothing; this only 
revealed its true hegemonistic face to the world's people. If 
we had mighty comprehensive national strength, would it have 
dared to conduct the check? Could it have gotten away as it did 
without feeling any shame? Realities in the world have also 
shown us that if a country has not developed, or has been slow 
in developing, its productive forces for a long time, while 
failing to improve its people's material and cultural lives, its 
very advanced weaponry and mighty security and intelligence 
network will not help; it is impossible to maintain its position 
of independence and taking the initiative in its own hand, while 
finding it difficult to maintain its subsistence. That being 
the case, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "Development is the last 
word." [fa zhan cai shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 
6670 3810] 
  As a political power, China's position in the world and its 
role in world affairs are not to be neglected. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping said that we must "accomplish something," by which he 
precisely means to oppose hegemonism and power policies, uphold 
justice, and safeguard world peace. To accomplish something, a 
firm stand is called for and a material base. When China 
develops its productive forces in future, becoming not only a 
political power but also an economic power, we will have a 
greater say in the world arena. 
  China's reform and opening up are developing in depth and 
our 
gate will open still wider; nongovernment ties of various kinds 
with the outside world are increasing. In nongovernment ties, 
we should never forget the principle of "maintaining 
independence, taking the initiative in our own hands, and 
relying on our own efforts," which Chairman Mao Zedong 
persistently advocated and Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always 
adhered to. The speech and behavior characterized by blind 
worship of anything foreign and loss of national character and 
personality in diplomatic exchanges should be rejected. The 
world situation is like the weather; there are stormy days and 
sunny ones. No matter what situation we meet, we shall always 
firmly grasp one point: Maintaining independence, taking the 
initiative in our own hands, and relying on our own efforts has 
been, is, and will always be our standpoint.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 12 (YONHAP) -- North Korean President 
Kim Il-song is likely to visit Beijing soon to discuss with 
Chinese leaders problems on the Korean peninsula following the 
resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, sources said 
Wednesday [12 January]. 
  Kim wants to visit Beijing in the belief that the 
circumstances surrounding the Korean peninsula will change 
rapidly as a result of successful negotiations between his 
country and the United States, said the sources, who are well 
informed on North Korean affairs. 
  "North Korea is secretly sounding out the Chinese Government 
on the possibility of Kim's visit through diplomatic channels," 
one source said. "Beijing is showing agreement in principle for 
the North Korean leader's visit to China after the nuclear 
question is resolved." 
  If the visit takes place, Kim and Chinese leaders will 
discuss such problems as reform and open-door policy in North 
Korea, improvements in North Korea's relations with Japan and 
the United States, an inter-Korean summit and South-North 
relations, he said. 
  In this connection, Hwang Chang-yop, chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly and one of 
Kim's closest aides, will visit Beijing in late January at the 
invitation of the Chinese Government to discuss the visit, the 
source said. 
  "Hwang's Chinese visit has not been made public in detail as 
yet, but judging by recent developments both in North Korea and 
China, Hwang will discuss issues related to the Korean peninsula 
as well as Kim's visit," he said. 
  In addition, Hwang will study China's reform and open 
policy, 
he said. 
  Chinese officials confirmed Hwang's planned visit in 
meetings 
with the South Korean National Assembly speaker when he visited 
China on Jan. 6-11, the source said. 
  Hwang surfaced as a core member of the North Korean power 
hierarchy during the December session of the Supreme People's 
Assembly along with Kim Il-song's brother, Kim Yong-chu. 
  Hwang was appointed chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee 
and named to head a so-called task force for relations with 
China and the United States. As such, he is understood to be 
managing issues related to improving ties with the United States.

Satellite"] 
  [Text] Preparations are in full swing to launch the 
country's first geostationary weather satellite, the China 
Meteorological Administration (CMA) said yesterday. 
  Experts are working on ground station facilities and testing 
equipment and the satellite, called Fengyun-2 (FY-2) will be 
launched sometime this year. 
  FY-2, the third Chinese meteorological satellite since 1988, 
will be located in geostationary orbit 35,800 kilometres above 
105 East Longitude which runs through west-central China, CMA 
officials said. 
  They said the satellite will be able to monitor 
meteorological changes over a third of the globe. 
  Meanwhile, China is to import a supercomputer from the 
United 
States to improve its newly-opened medium-range numerical 
weather prediction (NPW) system, which can forecast changes four 
to 10 days in advance. The U.S. machine will replace the 
domestically-made Yinhe 2, China's most advanced supercomputer. 
CMA officials also said a new continental weather station will 
be set up this year at a place 3,816 metres above sea level in 
West China's Qinghai Plateau.

<F P=106> [By Zhou Guangting (0719 1639 1656), Li Xunzhou (2621 6064 </F>

"Temper an Army of Steel--Chronicle of General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin's Concern for Building Armed Police Force Units"] 
  [Text] The Chinese People's Armed Police Force [PAPF] was 
reestablished in 1983 under the ideological guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of reform and opening up, through 
the necessity to provide a stable social environment for reform 
and construction. Over the past decade, under the leadership of 
the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the CPC 
Central Military Commission and with the concern and support of 
local party committees, governments, and the masses at all 
levels, this unit has matured into an important armed force 
defending the socialist system and maintaining social stability. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin, as Party general secretary, State 
president, and chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission, 
is a very busy man and occupied with a myriad of state affairs 
but he is very much concerned about the building of the PAPF. 
Over the past few years, his footprints have extended across 
PAPF battalions in 28 provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities throughout the country. He has encouraged vast 
numbers of PAPF officers and men to accomplish their mission and 
constantly make contributions to the motherland and the people. 
<H3>  A Good Social Environment Is Essential for Economic 
Construction. General Secretary Jiang Urged: "The PAPF Should 
Stand in the Forefront of Maintaining Public Order and Social 
Stability." </H3>
  Whenever people step into the PAPF headquarters, the 
Triangle 
Building, the first things that come into view are the 16 
glittering characters of: "Strengthening the Building of the 
PAPF, Defending the Socialist System" erected in the hall. This 
was the inscription made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin when 
he inspected the PAPF headquarters on 19 December 1990. Up to 
now, cadres of the PAPF Headquarters retain fresh in their 
memory the scenes of General Secretary Jiang's inspection. At 
1515 on that day, General Secretary Jiang, accompanied by Qiao 
Shi, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee 
member and secretary of the CPC Central Commission of Political 
Science and Law, went to the PAPF headquarters. He met 
cordially with cadres at and above the department level, 
conscientiously listened to work reports presented by leaders of 
the PAPF, and often chipped in with cheerful and humorous 
remarks. 
  General Secretary Jiang analyzed the domestic and 
international situation and expounded on the nature, position, 
and role of the PAPF from the high plane of consolidating the 
socialist system. He said: "Our present socialist system has 
been built at the expense of the bloody sacrifices of tens of 
millions of revolutionary martyrs and we must definitely defend 
it. The PAPF is a component of the armed forces of our Party 
and our country. Its tasks are different from that of the 
People's Liberation Army [PLA], but both the PAPF and the PLA 
serve the people. The PAPF undertakes important tasks in 
defending the socialist system and maintaining social stability 
and we must definitely build it up well." 
  Our hearts were filled with deep feelings and we have to 
shoulder heavy burdens. General Secretary Jiang placed high 
hopes on the PAPF in safeguarding socialist modernization. 
  On the eve of the 1991 Spring Festival, General Secretary 
Jiang went to the headquarters of the Henan PAPF, cordially paid 
homage to officers and men, and said: "The Spring Festival is 
approaching. I am paying an early New Year call on all of you!" 
Then, he pointed out: "Our Party set out the proposal on the 
`Eighth Five-Year Plan' and the `10-Year Program' at the Seventh 
Plenary Session of the 13th Central Party Committee, which was 
recently held. Now, the whole country is studying and 
implementing it. However, there is a very important problem 
which is directly related to your tasks. It is impossible to 
accomplish our economic construction without a stable situation. 
Only under a stable political situation can we really devote 
our energies to promoting our economy. Viewed from the present 
international situation it is, by and large, favorable to us. 
Peace and development are still the two themes of the world but 
we should also watch out for the volatile international 
situation. We must always heighten our vigilance against some 
foreign forces which infiltrate our country and carry out 
subversive activities. We must resolutely nip in the bud every 
symptom which endangers social stability once we discover it. 
This is, in the first place, the duty of the PAPF. I hope that 
all of you always have high morale and exert yourselves in the 
struggle to create and maintain a good social environment for 
our country's economic construction." 
  On 12 October 1992, General Secretary Jiang was delivering 
his report to the 14th CPC National Congress in the Great Hall 
of the People. "The PAPF is an important power in safeguarding 
our socialist modernization." The hearts of all armed police 
delegates to the 14th CPC National Congress were overflowing 
hearing this sonorous voice. Delegates said excitedly in the 
discussions: It is the first time that the PAPF has been 
mentioned in the report to the party congress. General 
Secretary Jiang has further defined the glorious mission of the 
PAPF during the new era of development of the socialist 
undertaking. 
  General Secretary Jiang set forth the ideology of allowing 
the PAPF to stand in the forefront and fight in the van when 
dealing with emergencies and maintaining social stability in 
accordance with the peculiarities of the PAPF in performing its 
missions. 
  On the night of 19 April 1991, General Secretary Jiang went 
to inspect Sichuan Province. After a discussion with the 
Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and the provincial government, 
disregarding his tiredness after a day's work, he asked Lin 
Xianze and Li Kaiyuan, commander and deputy commander of the 
Sichuan Armed Police Corps, about the detailed public security 
situation in Sichuan. On the following morning, in drizzling 
rain, General Secretary Jiang went to the Sichuan Armed Police 
Corps Headquarters for an inspection. On the parade ground, 
while braving the rain, he met cadres from the headquarters and 
earnestly told everybody: "We must implement the basic party 
line unswervingly and devote our energies to accomplishing 
economic construction. However, it is impossible to accomplish 
economic construction without a stable and united social 
environment and there is no exception to this, in modern or 
ancient times in China or elsewhere. No country has ever 
accomplished economic construction under constantly chaotic 
circumstances. Only with social stability and unity can we have 
the preconditions to develop our economy. On what does 
stability and unity rely? It relies on correct policies, strong 
ideological and political work, skillful handling of the two 
different kinds of conflicts and, in the final analysis, it 
relies on economic development. The PAPF must stand in the 
frontline and fight in the van in safeguarding public security. 
Our PAPF must always be prepared for any destabilizing event 
and decisively nip it in the bud, thus ensuring a stable and 
unified situation. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin has expounded on many occasions since 
becoming general secretary, the ideology of allowing the PAPF to 
stand in the front line to maintain social stability. 
  --On 3 July 1989, he talked about the task of further 
safeguarding social stability when meeting all the comrades who 
attended the National Public Security Department (Bureau) Heads 
Conference. He said: "I think under normal circumstances, we 
mainly rely on our public security personnel and our armed 
police." 
  --On 28 September 1990, he emphatically pointed out when 
inspecting the Inner Mongolian Armed Police Corps: "As far as 
the task of maintaining social stability is concerned, those who 
stand in the forefront are the Armed Police." 
  --On 19 September 1993, he further stressed when reviewing 
the PAPF's achievements in military training: "As far as the 
defense of state security and social stability is concerned, the 
ideology of marching to the forefront and fighting in the van 
must be firmly established in the PAPF." 
  The ideology of "standing in the forefront" and "fighting in 
the van" has been kept firmly in the minds of armed police 
officers and men and has become their strong impetus in 
defending modernization. 
<H3>  The PAPF Spreads All Over the Country and Is In Direct 
Contact With Society. General Secretary Jiang Stressed: "It Is 
Very Important To Vigorously Advocate and Carry Forward Our 
Army's Glorious Tradition." </H3>
  The PAPF has to undertake many tasks covering an extensive 
areas. Due to special tasks and the macroscopic social 
environment of reform and opening up, special requirements have 
been set on building the ideology and style in this force. An 
important matter which General Secretary Jiang often pays 
attention to is how to preserve the purity of the PAPF. 
  In the small hours of a certain day in March 1991, General 
Secretary Jiang, who was inspecting Hunan, could not calm 
himself for a long time after reading a letter addressed from 
Mao Anying to his relative in October 1949. 
  The following day, General Secretary Jiang addressed a 
meeting attended by PLA and PAPF cadres, at and above the 
division level, stationed in Changsha City. He said with deep 
feelings: "A relative of Mao Anying wrote him a letter hoping 
that Chairman Mao could assign a government post to another 
relative of Mao Anying. In his letter of reply Mao Anying stated 
his views. The main points were that the fundamental difference 
distinguishing the New China from the old, the Communist Party 
from the Kuomintang, and Mao Zedong from Chiang Kai-shek, lay in 
the virtue of not seeking personal gain. Today, this letter is 
still worthy of our study. If vast numbers of our Party members 
and cadres can serve the interests of the majority and refrain 
from seeking personal gain, just as the revolutionary martyrs 
did, our party style will be improved and our Party will become 
stronger. We must frequently teach vast numbers of cadres and 
soldiers to carry forward the fine tradition, cultivate 
patriotic thinking and communist values and outlook on life, and 
serve the people wholeheartedly." 
  In the autumn of 1991, General Secretary Jiang went to 
Xibaipo to "reflect on the past in light of the present" and all 
sorts of feelings welled up his mind. When addressing the 
police from Hebei Provincial Public Security Department and 
cadres from Hebei Provincial Armed Police Corps, he said: "A 
visit to Xibaipo is a very good education for all of us. 
Xibaipo was once the seat of the Central Party Committee and 
the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee 
was held there. At the party plenary session, Chairman Mao 
urged that we must be modest and prudent and guard against 
arrogance and rashness and that we must keep to the style of 
hard struggle and plain living. In this respect, how well are 
we now? This is the question which all of us should ponder." 
  In January 1992, as No.10 Detachment of the Shanghai Armed 
Police Corps launched activities to mark the 10th anniversary of 
"emulating the Good No. 8 Company on Nanjing Road," General 
Secretary Jiang went there on an inspection. While attentively 
viewing silk banners and certificates of merit in the 
detachment's honorary room he could not help saying: "We must 
be willing to act as orderlies who are untainted with unhealthy 
practices and this is a tradition which we must carry forward!" 
General Secretary Jiang also wrote an inscription for the No. 
10 Detachment: "The new generation under neon lights must 
emulate the Good No. 8 Company on Nanjing Road, to encourage 
officers and men to learn from the `Good No. 8 Company,' to 
carry forward the glorious tradition of never being tainted with 
corrupt practices and constantly make new contributions to 
safeguarding Shanghai's reform, opening up, and modernization. 
  One morning in the early summer of 1993, the West Room in 
the Great Hall of the People was ablaze with lights. General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin, accompanied by Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, 
Ren Jianxin, Luo Gan, and other cadres, listened to reports on 
the PAPF work situation by Commander Ba Zhongtan and Political 
Commissar Zhang Shutian. Afterwards, he emphatically told 
members of the PAPF party committee: "Our PAPF is spread all 
over the country, including Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and other more 
prosperous localities. In strengthening the building of the 
force, particularly in the work of building our ideology and 
style, we are faced with an environment of constantly deepening 
reform and wider opening up. It is very important to take the 
new reality and new tasks into consideration and vigorously 
advocate and carry forward our Army's glorious tradition. The 
PLA's Good No. 8 Company on Nanjing Road always maintained its 
distinctive revolutionary character amidst an atmosphere of 
debauchery, which was very remarkable. There is always the 
question of guarding against degeneration in army building in 
times of peace, and we must never be tainted with corrupt 
practices. The PAPF is the same in this respect. The PAPF is in 
direct contact with society, in particular, some of the units 
live in some prosperous and open cities and are faced with 
scenes of debauchery. Therefore, it is necessary to teach and 
encourage officers and men to stand the test and maintain a high 
morale." 
  These remarks, which were full of deep feelings, inspired 
vast numbers of armed police officers and men to inherit the 
glorious tradition of our Party and Army, carry forward the 
"five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, 
maintain the true qualities of the people's army, and portray a 
good image of people's guards. 
<H3>  The Sacred Mission of Maintaining Social Stability Sets a 
Very High Demand on the PAPF's Building. General Secretary 
Jiang Pointed Out: "The PAPF Must Pay Attention to Its Software 
and Hardware and Constantly Improve the Capability To Perform 
Its Duties and To Handle Emergencies." </H3>
  On 19 September 1993, during the autumn harvest, General 
Secretary Jiang went to the PAPF Special Police Academy in the 
suburbs of Beijing to review PAPF achievements in military 
training. Following a number of brilliant performances and 
bursts of warm applause, he cheerfully stood up to wave 
greetings to officers and men and commended them: "Your reports 
gave expression to your superb and competent military technique, 
your valiant and tenacious fighting style, and the mental 
attitude of staunch guards. The comprehensive building of the 
PAPF is being constantly strengthened and new progress in all 
kinds of work is being constantly achieved, the Central Party 
Committee is satisfied." After fully affirming the building and 
work of the PAPF, General Secretary Jiang set overall demands on 
how to further strengthen the PAPF's building. He made a call to 
armed police officers and men: It is necessary to uphold 
steadfastly our Party's absolute leadership of the Army; 
resolutely comply with the command of the Central Party 
Committee and the Central Military Commission; firmly implement 
instructions issued by the Central Party Committee the State 
Council, and the Central Military Commission; and steadfastly 
implement the basic party line. It is necessary to 
conscientiously study Mao Zedong's military thought and Deng 
Xiaoping's thinking on military building during the new period; 
resolutely implement PLA regulations; and uphold the principle 
of improving the quality of army building. It is necessary to 
place education in a strategic position and integrate it with 
the reality of the PAPF to go in for rigorous training, set 
stricter demands, and enforce stricter controls. It is 
necessary to improve weaponry; enhance military and political 
quality; and improve the capability to perform our duties and 
handle emergencies under modern conditions. It is necessary to 
inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of our Party 
and Army; strive to develop the PAPF into a dauntless unit which 
is "qualified politically and competent militarily" and which 
"has a fine style of work, adheres to strict discipline, and is 
ensured of adequate maintenance and supplies"; and 
conscientiously perform the sacred mission of maintaining state 
security and social stability! 
  General Secretary Jiang not only portrayed the magnificent 
blueprint of the PAPF's building but also set concrete demands 
on it. He used engineering terminology, in light of the new 
domestic and international situation and the PAPF's 
characteristics, to liken the PAPF's equipment to "hardware" and 
to equate the military and political quality of officers and men 
to "software." He stated unequivocally: "The PAPF must pay 
attention to both the software and hardware and constantly 
improve the capability to perform your duties and to handle 
emergencies." 
  On the afternoon of 2 August 1989, a meeting was called 
commending public security personnel and the Shanghai PAPF. 
General Secretary Jiang specially canceled his schedule and 
cheerfully attended the meeting to extend his greetings. He 
also gave important instructions on the building of public 
security and the PAPF. He pointed out: "As an instrument of 
the people's democratic dictatorship, public security and the 
PAPF must be armed with goods and materials as well as vigor. 
The latter means that we must be armed with 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, always maintain political 
alertness, and have a high degree of consciousness." 
  In the early summer of 1993, the new situation in the 
development of the socialist market economy brought new vitality 
to the PAPF and also posed new problems, one after another, to 
the building of the force. In order to enable officers and men 
to adapt to the new situation, General Secretary Jiang promptly 
issued a call to the force to study more. He stressed when 
meeting members of the PAPF party committee at the Great Hall of 
the People that, in the process of developing a socialist market 
economy, we must constantly learn new knowledge and that his was 
also very important to strengthening the building of the force. 
He said: "Under the new situation, our leaders at all levels 
must strive to learn new knowledge and new things. We are now 
engaging in a socialist market economy but what exactly is the 
market, the market mechanism, and the socialist market economy? 
Many comrades do not have, or are short of, basic knowledge in 
this field. Hence, we must study it well and should study it 
repeatedly. We must study scientific and technological 
knowledge through various channels to advance our cultural 
quality to a new stage. Our cultural quality covers every 
aspect, including the quality of economic knowledge, of 
scientific and technological knowledge, and of military 
knowledge. The PAPF must attach importance to improving its 
military, scientific, and technological quality. In the first 
place, it must improve the military and scientific and 
technological quality of leading armed police cadres at all 
levels, particularly that of senior cadres. Only when this has 
been done can the force become really combat- ready." 
  In order to help fully improve the PAPF military and 
political quality and make its "software" and "hardware" 
competent, General Secretary Jiang personally inspected the PAPF 
Training Ground despite many claims on his time. 
  On the morning of 30 July 1991, it was scorching hot in 
Tianjin Municipality. General Secretary Jiang, who was there on 
an inspection, went to the Tianjin Armed Police Corps No. 6 
Detachment Training Ground and braved the intense heat of summer 
to watch in the open the report-back performance of military 
training. After watching such brilliant performances as 
emergency dispatch, tactics of using batons and shields, and the 
formation of anti-riot squads, he said cheerfully: "This kind 
of competency is what we should have, especially in large 
cities. In case emergencies arise, we can immediately dispatch 
the armed police to nip them in the bud." 
  On 4 May 1992, a get-together was held at the Great Hall of 
the People to mark the 70th anniversary of the Communist Youth 
League's founding and General Secretary Jiang, who attended, was 
impressed by the unique skills demonstrateded by the armed 
policemen. Full of zest, he talked to the performers from the 
Special Police Academy and repeatedly praised them on their 
extraordinary skills. 
  It has never been easy to strengthen the building of PAPF 
"hardware" and party and government leaders and the departments 
of politics and law at all levels must support and attach 
importance to it. Hence, on many occasions, General Secretary 
Jiang has told leading comrades in provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities that we must attach importance to 
building the PAPF "hardware." We should spare no expense in 
properly arming the armed police. In compliance with General 
Secretary Jiang's instructions, party committees and governments 
in various localities have: Paid great attention to building 
the PAPF; given strong support to them in terms of finance and 
goods and materials; set up a number of regular barracks; and 
have installed groups of excellent cavalry. 
  Living up to our Party's and the people's concern and 
expectations, the PAPF have made arduous efforts to strengthen 
the building of "software" and "hardware" and constantly improve 
its combat strength. As a result, a number of heroic 
collectives which are ready to assemble at the first call and 
capable of fighting and winning, such as the "special police of 
Lingnan," the "iron fist of Nankai," and the "keen sword of 
Cangshan," have emerged. 
<H3>  Soldiers Are the Basis of the Force. General Secretary 
Jiang Hoped That the "Relationship Between Officers and Men and 
Between Comrades Should be Even Closer Than the Relationship 
Between Family Members." </H3>
  The Shanghai Armed Police Corps No. 10 Detachment will never 
forget 18 January 1992. On that day, General Secretary Jiang 
visited them and went straight to the dormitory of the Class No. 
2. He touched the soldiers' quilts and asked: "Are you feeling 
cold?" 
  On learning that every soldier was given a quilt, a woolen 
blanket, and an overcoat, he smiled and said to the soldiers: 
"You have three layers of warmth." Everybody present laughed. 
  General Secretary Jiang asked about soldiers' cultural and 
recreational activities. He told leaders of the corps by his 
side: "Soldiers' cultural and recreational activities must be 
organized well." 
  General Secretary Jiang also inspected the kitchen and asked 
in detail about the varieties and nutritious value of the meals. 
  General Secretary Jiang urged leaders of the PAPF at all 
levels to inherit and carry forward the fine tradition initiated 
by Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and revolutionaries of the older 
generation and pay great attention to the building of the force 
by maintaining close ties between officers and men. 
  On 17 May 1990, General Secretary Jiang met cadres from the 
Hainan Armed Police Corps and PLA stationed in Hainan at and 
above the division level. He urged all of them to fully 
understand the importance of unity between officers and men from 
the high plane of the nature of the People's Army. He said 
sincerely: "Our Army is a proletarian force and the people's 
own army. Unity between officers and men and support given to 
soldiers has always been the fine tradition of our Army. Why do 
the broad masses support the revolution and the Army and send 
their children to the Army? It is precisely because our Army 
fights and works for the people's interests and, for this same 
reason, the relationship between officers and men and between 
comrades is even closer than the relationship between family 
members." 
  To counter some of the relationship problems between 
officers and men in a small number of units, General Secretary 
Jiang twice urged party committees and leaders at all levels to 
pay attention to solving these problems in grass-roots units. 
He said: "The fact that some problems have arisen in the 
relationship between officers and men shows that we have not 
been painstaking enough in doing our ideological work and we do 
not have adequate understanding of soldiers' ideological trends. 
Something happens but we often do not know the reason why and 
muddle through. How can we act like this? In the past, company 
commanders and political instructors would watch every night 
which soldiers tossed about in bed or which soldiers suddenly 
ate less than they normally did. In these cases, company 
commanders and political instructors would try to understand 
whether or not the soldiers had ideological problems or whether 
or not their families had any problems. Such a fine tradition 
of doing painstaking ideological work can never be cast away! 
It is very important to be solicitous about soldiers' health, 
understand their mental state, be concerned about their weal and 
woe, and solve their problems." 
  As general secretary of our Party, state president, and 
chairman of the Central Military Commission, Comrade Jiang Zemin 
is extremely busy but he is always concerned about the PAPF 
building and spares time to visit armed police officers and men 
to talk to them meticulously. His conduct sets an example to 
leaders at all levels. 
  On 13 October 1989, General Secretary Jiang inspected work 
in 
Jiangxi. Around noon on that day, after finishing his work, he 
had photos taken with leading comrades of the provincial party 
committee and working personnel. At 0900 the following day, 
after learning that six soldier guards who had been on duty and 
had not had their photos taken with him, General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin joyfully agreed to have one more photo taken. When he saw 
that the six soldier guards stood behind him in a reserved 
manner, he moved a step backward and cordially said: "It is 
better to stand alongside to take a photo." Then, the general 
secretary stood in the midst of the soldiers and the photo was 
taken. 
  On the morning of 13 November 1991, in the cold wind of the 
early winter, General Secretary Jiang and other leading comrades 
from the Central Party Committee went to a construction site at 
Liangshuihe, Beijing, to participate in the work. Red flags 
fluttered over the construction site, which was seething with 
excitement. At 0955, General Secretary Jiang went to an armed 
police construction site and extended cordial greetings to the 
officers and men. After learning from leaders of Beijing 
Municipality that due to inadequate machinery, the officers and 
men had borne many hardships and made great contributions to 
flood control projects, he repeatedly praised them saying: 
"Great, great!" The general secretary's commendation was like 
a warm current which boosted the strength of thousands of armed 
police officers and men to surmount difficulties and which 
inspired everybody to fulfill his task while ensuring quality. 
  Cordial care is a tremendous driving force. Living up to the 
expectations of General Secretary Jiang and the Central Party 
Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military 
Commission, armed police officers and men have: Satisfactorily 
completed the task of guarding against and dealing with 
emergencies; guaranteed the safety of fixed targets and targets 
of temporary service; achieved remarkable results in rushing to 
deal with emergencies and in providing disaster relief; and the 
have played an important role in the comprehensive management of 
public security, thus making contributions to safeguarding 
socialist modernization.

and Tang Weibin (0781 5898 1755): "The Great Undertaking of the 
Three Gorges Project Will Shine a Thousand Years To Come -- A 
Report on Premier Li Peng's Inspection of the Three Gorges 
Project"] 
  [Text] Yichang, 23 Dec (XINHUA) -- Standing on the central 
axis line at the future worksite of the Great Three Gorges Dam 
with a pair of binoculars, Premier Li Peng commanded a full view 
of the water near him and a mountain in the distance. 
  The Tanzi Mountain is on the left bank and the Baiyanjian 
Mountain is on the right bank; a bustling worksite and the 
rushing Changjiang are also in view. 
  On 20 December 1993, accompanied by Chen Jinhua, minister of 
the State Planning Commission; Guo Shuyan and Li Boning, deputy 
directors of the State Council Three Gorges Project Construction 
Committee; and Jia Zhijie, governor of Hubei, Premier Li Peng 
arrived in Sandouping to inspect the preparatory work for the 
Three Gorges Project. 
  Sandouping, 40 kilometers away from Hubei Province's Yichang 
City, is the dam site for the Changjiang Three Gorges Key Water 
Control Project, a project that has attracted worldwide 
attention. The Three Gorges Project officially entered the 
preparatory stage on 26 July this year. The earth-and-stone 
work on the building of the cofferdam, the first stage of the 
project, began on 24 October on the right side of the river bed. 
The roaring sound of the motor shook and awoke the sleepy 
valley. 
  Ascending the platform of the Zhongbaodao cofferdam, Li Peng 
gazed in the distance. Great changes have taken place here 
during the past year. Zhongbaodao was quiet when Li Peng 
inspected the Three Gorges on 25 November 1992. But now the 
first stage earth- and-stone-work of the cofferdam task has 
begun. The experimental section of the 750-meter cofferdam, 
which was completed at the end of June, has stood the test of 
the peak of the flood season. 
  Standing in front of the "Map of the Changjiang Three Gorges 
Key Water Control Project," General Manager Lu Youmei and Deputy 
General Manager He Gong of the China Changjiang Three Gorges 
Project Development Corporation briefed Li Peng and others on 
preparations for the project, pointing out that the major 
objectives of this year's preparatory work have been basically 
realized following five months' efforts. 
  Li Peng said: "The project's preparatory work involves a 
heavy workload. We must do a good job. As we are building here 
the most modern and first-rate project in the world, we must set 
first-rate engineering standards." 
  A white central axis line was painted on the center of the 
platform of the cofferdam. Li Peng looked at the Baiyanjian 
Mountain in the right bank with his binoculars. He asked: "What 
is the height of this mountain peak?" Wei Yanzheng, deputy 
director of the State Council's General Office for the Three 
Gorges Project, replied: "240 meters above sea level." Li Peng 
continued: "After completion of the Three Gorges Project, the 
distance between that mountain peak and the 185-meter dam will 
only be 50-60 meters. You should build a forest park there to 
preserve the beautiful scenery and excellent ecological system 
in the dam zone. Turning around, Li Peng looked at the Tanzi 
Mountain in the distance on the left side of the bank and asked: 
"What about this peak?" "It is also about 200 meters above sea 
level," came the reply. 
  Li Peng walked up to the north side of the cofferdam's 
platform amid the din of the machine. Some 30 dump trucks were 
seen travelling back and forth to dump the full load of sand and 
stone into the river. Li Peng turned to Qiao Shengxiang, chief 
of the Gezhou Dam Engineering Bureau, who is responsible for 
building the cofferdam, and said: "Cofferdam building has a 
direct bearing on the formal beginning of the Three Gorges 
Project. You bear a great responsibility." Li Peng turned 
again to Lu Youmei: "The building of the Three Gorges Project 
must be mechanized. First-rate builders must be mobilized for 
this project." 
  Seeing Li Peng walking toward them on the cofferdam's 
platform, workers there greeted the arrival of the premier with 
warm applause, and Li Peng waved at them. Li Peng spoke to Chen 
Jinhua, Guo Shuyan, Jia Zhijie, Lu Youmei, and other comrades 
while walking on the platform: "We should introduce a 
competitive mechanism into the Three Gorges Project and adopt a 
bidding system so as to attract the most outstanding 
construction teams to the Three Gorges Project. Competition 
raises efficiency. A competitive mentality is needed in our 
effort to build a socialist market economy." 
  Li Peng showed concern for the Three Gorges Project, for the 
preparation of the project, and for millions of settlers. Prior 
to inspecting the project's preparatory site, he made a special 
trip to visit the people who were resettled at the Zhujiawan 
resettlement zone located at the lower reaches of the dam site. 
  The Three Gorges Project, being an extra-large and key 
water-control project, is confronted with a tough task of 
resettling the people. Premier Li Peng has repeatedly 
emphasized: "The success or failure of the Three Gorges Project 
depends on resettling the people." Following many years of 
experiments, the dam zone has gained many useful experiences in 
the work of resettling the people. The masses generally welcome 
the experiment, since then have experienced marked economic, 
social, and environmental benefits in various resettlement sites. 
  Walking on a gravel road, Li Peng headed toward a temporary 
resettlement area. Yichang County Head Chen Hua pointed at a 
residential building in the distance which is undergoing 
construction and told the premier: "That building is for the 
settlers. It can accommodate 162 settlers. A total of 92 
people from 26 households will move into their new houses before 
the Spring Festival. 
  With much interest, Li Peng inquired into the details of the 
new houses for settlers. In a makeshift house, Li Peng was 
found sitting together and chatting with the family of settler 
Zhou Bin. Li Peng asked: "How many rooms did you have in your 
former house?" "Two," came the reply. "What is the size of the 
new house?" "160 square meters." Li Peng smilingly said: "It 
is bigger than your former house." Zhou Bin said: "That is 
because of the meticulous arrangements made by the party and 
government." 
  Li Peng asked Zhou Bin again: "What was your original 
occupation? "I was a carpenter." "What have you done after 
moving?" "After moving here, I was recruited into the village's 
construction team." 
  Li Peng said: "Carpenters play a big role in house building; 
they make windows and furniture." Zhou Bin spoke with pride: 
"I make those things." Li Peng spoke in a tone of praise: "As 
you have skills, you will surely lead a comfortable life!" At 
this, Zhou Bin smiled. 
  Li Peng looked inside and outside the house of Zhou Bin. He 
said: "Your housing condition is much better than that of the 
house I was provided in Tangshan when I took part in post-quake 
relief work. I stayed in Tangshan for over three months. 
  After bidding farewell to the Zhous, Li Peng visited another 
makeshift house. Viewing the surroundings, Li Peng asked Yang 
Guanghua, master of the household, about the number of family 
members and the size of the house. The old man told him that he 
had 12 members in his family and that they lived in three big 
rooms. Li Peng said: "You surely have a big family with four 
generations living under one roof. Your housing condition will 
improve after moving into a new house." 
  During their chat, a woman holding a little girl walked into 
the house. The little girl said: "How are you, uncle?" Li Peng 
asked "What is your name?" "I am Yang Qin." The innocent look 
of the little girl made all at the scene laugh. 
  Li Peng moved around the neighborhood at the temporary 
settlement site. At one time, he was seen talking with the 
people, and at another, he was seen discussing the resettlement 
plan with provincial, city, and county level cadres. He said: 
"The Three Gorges Project will benefit future generations. A 
great number of settlers have made great sacrifices for the 
construction of the project. As the resettlement work affects 
many people, we must stick to the development-type resettlement 
policy and properly resettle them." 
  Li Peng spoke to comrades who are involved in the 
resettlement work: "Resettlement work requires comprehensive 
planning and must proceed in strict compliance with the 
"Changjiang Three Gorges Construction Project's Resettlement 
Regulations" promulgated by the State Council. It is necessary 
to determine short-term as well as long-term priorities in the 
resettlement work according to the progress of the project and 
to expedite the resettlement work on the premise of fund 
availability. The current priority should be given to 
resettling people who live near the proposed dam site." 
  "I greatly appreciate the slogan, `Serve the Great Three 
Gorges and Build a New Yinchang' advanced by Yichang City." Li 
Peng added: "The building of the Gezhou Dam has invigorated 
Yichang. The Three Gorges Project will paint an even more 
beautiful picture for Yichang's development prospects. Comrades 
in Yichang should foster the thinking of serving the Three 
Gorges Project and make positive contributions to the project." 
  When leaving Zhujiawan, Li Peng waved and bid goodbye to the 
people there. He wished them all a happy Spring Festival and 
hoped that they would enjoy their new houses. 
  Following the inspection of the Three Gorges Dam Zone, 
Premier Li Peng rushed to Yichang City by transiting through the 
Sandouping building site again. The roar of the drilling 
machines and the sound of the motor vehicles, like part of a 
majestic symphony, reverberated along the great rushing river.

Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter Zheng Qingdong 
(6774 1987 2639)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Dec (XINHUA) -- The Three Gorges 
Project Construction Committee under the State Council held its 
third meeting in Zhongnanhai this afternoon. Those at the 
meeting heard briefings on construction preparations and on the 
resettlement of residents in the affected areas, and discussed 
matters concerning the project. 
  Premier Li Peng, who had just returned to Beijing from an 
inspection tour of the Three Gorges project, presided over the 
meeting. 
  Lu Youmei, general manager of the China Changjiang Three 
Gorges Project Development Corporation, briefed the attendees on 
the progress of preparations made for the construction of the 
project. According to the briefing, since the Three Gorges 
Project Construction Committee under the State Council approved 
the initial design of the project last July, preparations have 
been made for the construction of the project rather smoothly. 
Several objectives set at the beginning of the year were 
basically achieved. The year 1994 will be a year during which 
preparatory work for the construction of the projects will be 
done in an all-round way although the tasks will be very 
arduous. For this reason, all relevant departments should make 
concerted efforts to fulfill the annual plans in order to make 
full preparations for the construction of the project. 
  With the approval of the State Council, the Three Gorges 
Project Construction Committee will call a meeting on the 
resettlement of residents in the affected areas within the next 
few days to solve major problems in this regard. The meeting 
will also be aimed at mobilizing people's governments at various 
levels and large numbers of cadres and people in the areas along 
the planned reservoir to carry forward the spirit of 
self-reliance and hard struggle, and at mobilizing people in 
various parts of the country and departments of the State 
Council to support the resettlement of residents in the areas 
affected by the Three Gorges project, and to promote economic 
development in the areas along the Three Gorges. Tang Zhangjin, 
director of the Resettlement and Development Bureau of the Three 
Gorges Project Construction Committee under the State Council, 
gave a special briefing on preparations made for the forthcoming 
meeting. 
  While speaking at the meeting, leading comrades from Hubei 
and Sichuan provinces and from relevant departments of the State 
Council said that efforts should be made to do a good job in 
resettling residents of the affected areas and to support the 
construction of the Three Gorges project. 
  After hearing speeches by attendees, Premier Li Peng said: 
Organized by the Changjiang Three Gorges Project Development 
Corporation and through the concerted efforts of workers, 
tremendous progress has been made over the past year in 
preparing for the construction of the Three Gorges project. He 
once again stressed: The Three Gorges project will be a 
trans-century project, and its construction will have great 
significance for our country's economy -- it will benefit people 
not only of the present age but of centuries from now. Relevant 
localities and departments must work together, support one 
another, and, with a strong sense of responsibility to the 
people, successfully carry out this great project which will 
benefit future generations. 
  In his speech, Li Peng also emphasized that ministries and 
commissions of the State Council should set an example in 
supporting the project and take practical action in supporting 
construction in the areas along the Three Gorges. 
  On the resettlement of residents of the affected areas, Li 
Peng pointed out: The success or failure of the Three Gorges 
project depends on the resettlement of residents of the affected 
areas, and the key to doing a good job in this regard lies in 
leaders at various levels. It is imperative to uphold the 
principle of resettlement and development. Residents in the 
affected areas should be resettled according to the "Regulations 
Governing the Resettlement of People Due to the Construction of 
the Three Gorges Projects on Chang Jiang" and the special 
characteristics of the resettlement areas. In the excellent 
situation of reform and opening up, and with the support of 
people across the country, we must do a good job in resettling 
those people. 
  Other speakers at the meeting included Zou Jiahua, vice 
premier of the State Council, and Qian Zhengying, vice chairman 
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference and adviser to the State Council's Three 
Gorges Project Construction Committee, who expressed their views 
on matters concerning the construction of the project.

  [Text] Factional strife within the Chinese Communist Party 
has flared after patriarch Deng Xiaoping expressed anger over 
the way celebrations of the centenary of Chairman Mao's birthday 
had been "overplayed". 
  The 89-year-old senior leader also indirectly criticised the 
Politburo for failing to stop the partial revival of Maoism that 
went along with the festivities. 
  According to Chinese sources, Mr Deng earlier this month 
gave 
vent to his dissatisfaction over the Mao celebrations while he 
was on holiday in Shanghai. 
  "Who is behind the festivities?" he asked city officials, 
referring to the hundreds of Mao-related events held throughout 
the country in the run-up to Mao's birthday on December 26. 
  The sources said Mr Deng made an indirect reference to 
"underground general secretary" Deng Liqun, the conservative 
elder and former propaganda chief who had orchestrated the 
celebrations. The patriarch also expressed dismay at how his 
ideological foes had been given almost free rein. 
  It is understood Mr Deng was aware that the leftists had 
used 
the commemorative activities to reinstate Maoism and disparage 
the past 15 years of reform. Knowing that it would be against 
party decorum for him to lay down restrictions on Mao 
celebrations Mr Deng left Beijing about December 6 without 
issuing instructions on the subject. The only thing he did was 
to acquiesce in the suggestion of a member of his personal 
office that Deng Liqun, dubbed Little Deng by Western diplomats, 
should be told not to make any speeches or to write articles for 
the centenary. 
  An informed source said, however, that the patriarch was 
nonetheless shocked by the number and pervasive influence of the 
festivities. The source said while Mr Deng's anger was 
primarily aimed at Little Deng and his fellow ideologues, he was 
unhappy with how the Politburo, including President Jiang Zemin, 
had handled the issue. 
  "Members of the Politburo Standing Committee including Jiang 
Zemin, had in early December asked the patriarch at least three 
times how they should conduct the celebrations," the source 
said. "But Deng refused to say anything." While talking to 
local cadres in Shanghai, however, Mr Deng continued to express 
his confidence in the "third-generation leadership with comrade 
Jiang Zemin as its core". "They have done a good job with the 
economy," Mr Deng reportedly said. 
  Sources in Shanghai said Mr Deng would likely stay in the 
area until the Lunar New Year.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 10 (CNA) -- Taiwan has no set policy 
regarding the cooperative development of mainland Chinese-held 
Hainan Island, chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development said Monday [10 January]. 
  "A plan to develop the island is just in its initial stages 
and the government will not make a final decision until prudent 
evaluation and planning can be done," Hsiao said during a joint 
meeting of the Legislative Yuan's overseas Chinese affairs, 
interior and economic affairs committees Monday morning. 
  During a private visit to Singapore last week, Premier Lien 
Chan proposed that Taiwan and Singapore join hands to develop 
the island, which is open to foreign investment as a special 
economic zone. 
  Lien noted that Taiwan investments in the mainland will be 
better protected if they are under the name of 
Singapore-registered enterprises because Singapore has signed 
investment guarantee pacts with both Taiwan and the mainland. 
  Vice Chairman Kao Kung-lien of the Mainland Affairs Council 
said at the same meeting that the government will not engage in 
direct economic and trade cooperation with Mainland China for 
the time being. 
  He said that in accordance with the guidelines for national 
unification, local businessmen would be able to invest in Hainan 
Island through a third party and after approval from the 
government. 
  Hainan Island boasts rich natural resources, cheap, abundant 
labor, and holds the right to enact investment laws, Kao added. 
  Hainan however, is also facing problems resulting from poor 
infrastructure, insufficient financial support and a serious 
brain drain. 
  Kao said any plan for developing Hainan Island should take 
place after both sides of the Taiwan Strait sign agreements on 
joint exploitation of energy and natural resources. 
  In related news, Hainan authorities will establish a Hainan- 
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao economic promotion association soon 
to promote Hainan's exchanges and cooperative ties with those 
regions.

  [Text] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has finalized a 
timetable for the privatization of 10 state-run enterprises, 
with three of them to go private by the end of June, according 
to the Commission of National Corporations under the ministry. 
  Yeh Men-sheng, vice chairman and executive director of the 
Commission of National Corporations, said the Legislature in 
mid- December approved a proposal to privatize the Taiwan 
Machinery Manufacturing Corp. (TMMC), BES [expansion unknown] 
Engineering Corp., and China Petrochemical Development Corp. 
(CPDC) before fiscal 1994 ends on June 30. 
  Of these, the TMMC will be sold to the private sector 
directly through an open tender, while the BES and the CPDC will 
undergo public underwriting prior to open tender. Yeh said his 
commission is stepping up related preparations for the 
privatization of these three enterprises. 
  He continued that the BES and the CPDC will release 170 
million shares and 330 million shares, respectively, for public 
sales before the end of June. 
  Meanwhile, the state-run China Steel Corp., which will be 
fully turned to private hands before fiscal 1995 ends on June 
30, 1995, will release as many as 1.535 billion shares, some 22 
percent of its total shareholdings, before the end of June 1994. 
  Accordingly, there are more than 2 billion shares to be made 
available for public sales in the coming six months. In order 
not to affect the performance of local stock market, the release 
will be enforced in several stages of time before June 30, Yeh 
said. 
  He added that Taiwan Fertilizer Corp. will go private in 
fiscal 1995, and China Shipbuilding Corp. in fiscal 1997. And 
the remaining six enterprises under the jurisdiction of the 
Ministry of Economic Affairs, such as Taiwan Power Company, 
Chinese Petroleum Corp., Taiwan Sugar Corp., and Taiwan Salt 
Works will be privatized before fiscal 2001. 
  Statistics showed that in the third quarter of last year, 
the 
10 state-owned enterprises recorded total earnings of NT$ [New 
Taiwan dollars] 37.6 billion, some NT$7.4 billion higher than 
the firms' projected earnings. 
  The reasons cited for the higher-than-predicted earnings 
included reduced costs for power generation at Taiwan Power 
Company, cheaper crude oil prices which cut costs for the 
Chinese Petroleum Corp., a stabilization of the market for a 
variety of products manufactured by state-owned companies, and 
improved efficiency at the firms. 
  Nevertheless, the investment growth rate of the state-run 
firms was estimated to slide to only 1.6 percent in 1993 to hit 
a five- year low, compared with 9.59 percent in 1991. 
  The sluggishness of investment activities by government 
enterprises was attributed to the established policy of 
privatization, slowdown of economic recovery and in increase in 
environment-related protests.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 10 (CNA) -- A depot-level F-16 
maintenance shop is expected to be built in Taiwan as part of 
the United States' plan to sell 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan, a 
Ministry of Economic Affairs official said Monday [10 January]. 
  Lockheed Corp., which signed a contract with the Republic of 
China [ROC] Air Force in December 1992 for the sale of 150 F-16s 
and equipment worth U.S.$5.8 billion over the next six years, 
has decided to call a meeting of more than 10 U.S. companies in 
March for discussions on technology transfers and other 
cooperation with Taiwan in building the F-16 maintenance shop. 
  According to David Chu, director of the Committee for 
Aviation &amp; Space Industry Development under the economics 
ministry, the projected depot-level F-16 maintenance shop will 
be the first such shop outside the United States. 
  Chu said a project assessment is expected to be complete 
this 
year. 
  If the maintenance shop is built in Taiwan, Chu said, the 
shop will not only be used by Taiwan's 150 F-16s, it could also 
serve similar types of F-16s owned by South Korea, Singapore, 
Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia. 
  Vice Economics Minister Yang Shih-chien estimated that the 
maintenance shop will create an annual U.S.$1 billion worth of 
contracts for domestic industry by 2000. 
  Domestic spare parts makers will reap an additional U.S.$500 
million in annual spare parts supply contracts, Yang predicted.

  [Text] Senior commanders in the Army are reportedly split 
on a decision to purchase over 200 used M60-A3 tanks from the 
United States in a deal worth NT$5 [new Taiwan dollars] billion, 
local press reported yesterday. 
  The M60-A3 tanks that some Army leaders want to purchase are 
currently serving the U.S. detachment in South Korea. They will 
be retired soon and Washington has offered them for sale to 
Taiwan, according to the UNITED EVENING NEWS. 
  The M60-A3 offers no significant advantages over Taiwan's 
existing M48-series in terms of fire power. Both the M60-A3 and 
M48-A5 have a 105 mm main gun. 
  But with a 51,500 kg combat weight, an M60-A3 is more than 
2,500 kg heavier than an M48-A5, the heaviest main battle tank 
currently serving the ROC's armed forces. 
  The heavier weight will reduce the M60-A3's maneuverability 
in Taiwan, which is already a difficult operating ground because 
most of the island is covered by steep slopes and river deltas 
inaccessible to tanks, according to the tank's critics. 
  However, those who want to purchase the tank argued the 
M60-A3s can effectively serve as mobile land batteries against 
an invading force from mainland China. And at NT$20 million a 
piece, they asserted they were a great bargain for the army. 
  But those who oppose the purchase stated that the used tanks 
will be sitting ducks for the enemy's air force during an 
invasion because by the time troops begin an amphibious assault, 
the island's air force will have already been depleted and the 
tanks will be left without air cover -- leading to a disaster 
similar to those faced by the Egyptians in the Six-Day War, and 
more recently by the Iraqis in the Gulf War. 
  In addition, the list price does not include maintenance 
costs, which for tanks can be very expensive, and in any case 
the Army would have difficulty finding qualified technicians to 
maintain them due to a shortage of qualified personnel, the 
dissenters added. 
  Military officers opposed to the deal pointed out that the 
Army had already considered purchasing the tanks three years 
ago, but opted to buy AH-lW Cobra gunships instead because the 
military had decided that the M60s did not fulfill combat needs. 
They added the M60s are still unsuitable today. 
  Despite opposition from within the military, armed forces 
observers said the purchase will probably go through for 
political considerations. 
  The project would please both Washington and ROC [Republic 
of 
China] President Li Teng-hui. Li has taken a personal interest 
in armored units after a group of Army commanders complained of 
bad equipment when he visited an Army base in August last year, 
according to local press. 
  The M60-A3 tank, measuring 9.4 meters with its gun and 6.9 
meters without the gun, is manned by four crews. It is 3.63 
meters wide and 3.27 meters tall. 
  The tank can reach 48 kph on roads and has a maximum range 
of 
480 km. It is capable of breaching a vertical obstacle of 0.914 
meters and can cross a trench 2.59 meters wide. 
  The M60-A3 is powered by a 750 horsepower 12-cylinder 
air-cooled engine. Sixty-three shells are stored in the tank 
for the tank's main 105 mm gun. A well-trained crew can fire 
between six to eight rounds per minute. Certain shells have an 
effective range in excess of 9,000 meters.

  [Text] Taiwan's total foreign trade for 1994 is expected 
to grow 7.5 percent from a year earlier to a record high of 
US$175.6 billion, but its trade surplus may shrink to a 10-year 
low of US$7.1 billion, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) 
forecast yesterday. 
  Based on the BOFT predictions, the island's exports would 
increase 6.9 percent from 1993 to US$91.3 billion this year, 
while its imports would rise 8.23 percent to reach US$84.2 
billion, due to increased market liberalization here. 
  The same forecast indicated that exports to mainland via 
Hong 
Kong would maintain a robust annual growth of 21 percent to 
reach US$22.95 billion this year. The major reason cited is the 
strong market demand in the mainland triggered by increased 
Taiwan investment there. 
  Imports from Hong Kong, however, would post a marginal 
expansion of 1.5 percent to reach US$1.75 billion, as 
manufacturing industries in the British colony are gradually 
hollowing out. 
  The resultant trade surplus in favor of Taiwan would hit a 
record high of US$21.2 billion, the BOFR predicted. 
  Meanwhile, exports to the United States are expected to 
witness only a negligible expansion rate of 0.77 percent in 1994 
to reach US$23.6 billion. However, the United States would 
remain the largest export outlet for Taiwan-made products. 
  Imports from the United States are predicted to enjoy a much 
higher growth of 10.67 percent to reach US$19.5 billion this 
year. 
  As a result, the island's trade surplus with the United 
States would drop to a 10-year low of US$4 billion, compared 
with a high of US$16 billion to US$17 billion seen some six 
years ago. 
  By contrast, Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan is projected 
to reach a new high of US$15.8 billion in the new year. Imports 
from Japan would increase 6.9 percent to US$25 billion, and 
exports to that country would grow only 2.2 percent to US$9.1 
billion.

  [Text] Budapest, Jan. 8 (CNA) -- Trade relations between 
Hungary and Taiwan are expected to improve in the coming year, 
fueled by plans to open a Hungarian trade office in Taipei. 
  "That office could be opened in the spring," Bela Csepe, 
leader of the parliamentary faction of the Christian Democratic 
People's Party (CDPP), told a CNA reporter in Budapest. 
  Csepe and a CDPP Vice President Miklos Hasznos will travel 
to 
Taiwan Monday [10 January] for a week-long visit to promote the 
trade office. During their stay, the two will also meet with 
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Hsiu- jih and Vice 
President of the China External Trade Development Council K.H. 
Wu. 
  "Our main goal is to promote the opening of the hungarian 
trade office in Taipei," Csepe said, adding that further delay 
in opening the Taipei office will hold back development of 
bilateral economic cooperation. 
  Taipei opened a trade representative office in Budapest in 
1990, marking a new era of cooperation between the two countries 
which maintain no diplomatic relations. 
  In a recent interview with UJ MAGYARORSZAG, a daily with 
close ties to the government, Gabriella Farkas, vice president 
of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (HDF), said she realizes that 
a Hungarian trade office in Taipei would help Hungary sell 
foodstuffs and beverages to Taiwan. 
  The HDF is the leading force of a three-party coalition 
government in Hungary, which also includes the CDPP. 
  Budapest has, however, been very cautious about the opening 
of the Taipei office. 
  Farkas, who recently visited Taiwan, agreed that the office 
would give an impetus to the development of bilateral economic 
ties but stressed that it should not jeopardize national foreign 
policy. 
  She said diplomatic links with Taiwan are not likely at the 
moment as Budapest recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate 
Government of China, and Taiwan is considered a Chinese province.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 12 (CNA) -- India is considering 
establishing a trade office in Taipei with a view to 
strengthening cooperative ties with Taiwan, an Indian official 
said here Wednesday [12 January]. 
  Ashok Jha, director of the Asia-Pacific Department under 
India's Ministry of Commerce, noted that his country is also 
working to simplify visa procedures for Taiwan businessmen in 
order to facilitate the exchange of visits between the two sides. 
  Jha, leading an eight-member Indian trade mission here, 
arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a three-day visit. 
  India has relaxed a number of trade and investment 
regulations since July 1991 under a government strategy to 
promote market liberalization and internationalization, which 
aims to court more foreign investors, he pointed out. 
  For example, he added, the tariff ceiling was lowered from 
250 percent to the current 93 percent. 
  India has attracted more than US$4.1 billion in foreign 
investment during the past two and a half years, he said, adding 
the investors mainly came from the United States, Japan, 
Britain, and Switzerland. 
  With a population of 886 million, which provides a high 
purchasing power and low-cost labor force, India boasts great 
potential for development, he stressed. 
  Moreover, he elaborated, Taiwan and India could enter into a 
complementary relationship as foreign trade plays a leading role 
in Taiwan's economic development and India's foreign trade 
currently accounts for only 15 percent of its gross national 
product. 
  Taiwan manufacturers are welcome to forge joint ventures 
with 
their Indian counterparts or make investments in India in such 
industries as consumer products, auto parts, electronic 
components, and food processing, he said. 
  To explore more trade opportunities here, Jha and his 
mission 
will meet with Taiwan manufacturers at the China External Trade 
Development Council (Cetra) in the afternoon. 
  The Indian mission met with officials at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, the Board of Foreign Trade, and the Indian 
Chamber of Commerce in Taipei in the morning. 
  Trade ties between Taipei and New Delhi have been growing. 
Cetra, a semi-official foreign trade promotion organization in 
Taiwan, opened an office in New Delhi last November. Two-way 
trade totaled roughly US$500 million last year.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "An Unwise Move"] </F>
  [Text] On 6 Jan, disregarding the fact that Sino-U.S. 
textile talks had not yet been concluded, the U.S. government 
unilaterally announced that as of 17 Jan, the textile import 
quota for China in 1994 would be cut by 25 to 35 percent from 
that of 1993. Such a move would seriously damage normal 
Sino-U.S. trade and naturally has prompted vigorous protests 
from Chinese officials. It has also infuriated Chinese 
industrial and commercial sectors, apart from causing 
dissatisfaction among American importers and consumers. 
  The U.S. government cited the so-called "illegal transit" of 
China-made textile products, through third-world countries, 
into the United States, as reason for its move, which is 
untenable. 
  The textile product quota system is a means of regulation 
for 
normal textile trade. It was arrived at through negotiations on 
equal footing between the Chinese and U.S. governments and, as 
such, is totally unrelated to illegal textile transit. The 
Chinese government always opposes the illegal transit of textile 
products and deals with such practices sternly, when there is 
solid evidence. In fact, last year, China's MOFTEC publicly 
punished nine enterprises for such illegal practices, and called 
two special national conferences in connection with cracking 
down on illegal textile transit. The United States was well 
aware of the efforts China has made and their effects in this 
regard. But the U.S. government ignored these facts and 
arbitrarily extended the accusation to normal textile trade. 
This is completely wrong. 
  Trade disputes can only be solved through talks based on the 
principle of equality and mutual benefits. The U.S. 
government's latest move runs directly against this principle 
and has violated the GATT free trade rule and regulations of the 
International Multi- Fibre Agreement. 
  The United States should not imagine that its action can 
force China to yield. It will not achieve this. The Chinese 
people have never bowed to any external pressure. The U.S. 
unilateral cut in China's textile quota assuredly will hurt 
Chinese textile production and exporting firms. But ultimately 
it is its American textile importers and consumers who are going 
to be hurt. American firms engaged in joint-venture textile 
production and technological cooperation in China will also be 
hit hard. The serious consequences of such a move will also 
affect other American industries. 
  China's MOFTEC has solemnly declared that China will 
continue 
talks as originally planned in order to solve the problems 
through consultations. If the United States clings obstinately 
to its course, it will force China into a position where it has 
to adopt corresponding retaliatory actions. We hope the U.S. 
government will change its course, immediately correct the wrong 
action, and return to the path of consultation on equal footing 
in order to safeguard the normal development of Sino-U.S. trade 
and overall Sino-U.S. relations.

  [Text] Beijing, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Sino-U.S. relations 
should grow on the basis of mutual respect and seeking common 
ground while preserving differences, China's Vice-President Rong 
Yiren said here this morning. 
  When meeting with visiting U.S. Senator John F. Kerry, who 
is 
also a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Rong 
noted that China and the United States have no conflicts of 
fundamental interests. 
  Instead, he added, the improvement of bilateral relations is 
not only in the fundamental interests of the two peoples but is 
beneficial to world peace and development. 
  More U.S. statesmen and entrepreneurs are welcome to visit 
China and make joint efforts with their Chinese counterparts to 
enhance mutual understanding and prompt exchanges and 
cooperation in the fields of trade and economy, science and 
technology, Rong told Kerry. 
  "Given the different cultural and historical backgrounds as 
well as social traditions, it is normal that China and the 
United States hold different views on some issues," Rong said. 
  "The differences should be resolved through equal 
consultations in the spirit of mutual respect and seeking common 
ground while preserving differences." 
  Kerry said that during his current visit, he has witnessed 
the major progress China has made in many fields. 
  Rong and Kerry exchanged views frankly on the renewal of 
China`s most-favoured-nation trading status. 
  Zhu Liang, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
Chinese National People`s Congress, was among those who 
participated in the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- A celebration was 
held here this evening to mark the 10th anniversary of effective 
cooperation between the Chinese State Bureau of Foreign Experts 
(SBFE) and U.S. Educational Services Exchange with China (ESEC). 
  Lei Jieqiong, vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee of 
the Chinese National People's Congress [NPC], and Danny Yu, 
president of ESEC, were present on the occasion. 
  Ma Junru, director-general of SBFE, said at the celebration 
that the cooperation between SBFE and ESEC "has been fruitful" 
since the two established ties in 1983. 
  Over the past 10 years, ESEC has sent more than 700 English 
teachers to Chinese universities and held 510 sessions of 
English training classes in China, Ma said. 
  It has also hosted 85 sessions of international trade 
classes 
which trained over 3,400 Chinese students in international 
trade, Ma added. 
  ESEC has also set up relationships with some Chinese 
universities and educational study institutes as well. It has 
successfully held three evaluation symposiums on China's higher 
education with related Chinese universities and institutes.

<F P=106> [By Shang Jie (1424 2638): "U.S. Military Strategic </F>
Adjustment Revolves Around `Economic Security'"] 
  [Text] Since he became President of the United States, 
Clinton has adjusted and supplemented the Bush Administration's 
"regional defense strategy" according to the international 
situation, the strategic pattern in the post Cold war era, and 
U.S. economic demands. Now a new U.S. military strategy is 
beginning to take shape. Specifically, its contents are: Full 
attention to "economic security," maintaining reasonable 
military superiority, and strengthening the power to intervene 
in regional conflicts. 
  What confronted Clinton when he entered the White House was 
a 
combination of weakening American economic power and a further 
destabilized situation in international security. He holds that 
the United States should stop approaching national security in 
the narrow, Cold War-style military terms. National security is 
above all economic security, and economic revitalization should 
be an overwhelming priority. The United States could not speak 
of itself "as a world leader" if it did not do that. 
  To realize the strategic goal that "national security means 
primarily economic security," the Clinton Administration decided 
to conduct an overhaul of U.S. military structure. The military 
structure of the Cold War era will be replaced by a smaller but 
more flexible military force. The first step is to effect a 
reasonable cut in military force. By 1997, total troops on 
active service will have been cut to 1.4 million. Second, scale 
down the procurement of strategic nuclear weapons and high-tech 
conventional weapons, stop the enormously costly Strategic 
Defense Initiative project, and propose to reduce national 
defense expenditures by one third. Third, implement the 
"military-to-civilian conversion" plan to trim the national 
defense work force. Fourth, reduce the size of U.S. forces 
stationed in Europe and Asia, including slashing overseas 
military bases, installations, and troop strength. Fifth, 
heighten military attention to areas of concern to U.S. economic 
interests. But, in sharp contrast to U.S. overall troop cuts, 
troops stationed in the Middle East have been increased from the 
original 5,000 to 30,000 at present, indicating U.S. seriousness 
about safeguarding its lifeline -- oil. 
  To ensure that the economic security strategy achieves its 
objectives, Clinton has vigorously tried to maintain the United 
States' status as the world's only superpower by calling for 
adjustment in four areas of its military force. One, while 
reducing the nuclear arsenal, the military will maintain a vital 
deterrent nuclear force. In line with its nuclear force 
deployment principles, this may reduce the targets for nuclear 
attack plans but will include Third-World countries possessing 
or possibly possessing nuclear weapons as targets for strategic 
nuclear weapons. Regarding policies for nuclear force 
development, the goal is guaranteed quality, reasonable 
curtailment, maintaining research and development, halting 
production, scrapping the Strategic Defense Initiative project, 
and implementing the "anti-missile defense" plan. Two, changing 
the conventional force into a rapid-deployment force ready to 
move into areas where U.S. interests are under threat, this will 
enable the U.S. to intervene in regional crisis and conflicts 
anywhere around the world. Three, maintaining the superior 
military quality of the U.S. Army and its advanced weapons. 
Funding for developing new weapons technology will continue 
even during ongoing military expenditure cuts, the focus being 
weapon systems dealing with regional conflicts. Four, building 
an intelligence system capable of providing prompt, accurate 
analysis of the military, political, economic, and cultural 
conditions of an area of potential conflicts. 
  One notable feature of the Clinton Administration's military 
strategy is the increase in the strength of intervention in 
regional affairs. This forestalls any change in the 
international security structure that may be inimical to the 
United States. The Bush Administration's approach to regional 
conflicts was premised on the international balance of power and 
its use of force was often reactive. Whereas Clinton believes 
in limited state sovereignty,favors preemptive measures, and 
advocates the legitimacy and efficacy of supra-national military 
intervention. To prevent a global proliferation of ballistic 
missile technology and weapons of massive destruction, the 
United States will exert pressure on, and even "punish," 
companies and countries it believes are selling such technology. 
The United States is also stepping up negotiations with all 
concerned countries for a strict mandatory international 
nonproliferation treaty. 
  Apart from continuing to stress the role of allies, the 
Clinton Administration has repeatedly stressed: Launching peace 
diplomacy, its readiness to act alone if necessary, reserving 
the right to "selective intervention"--with a majority of 
military interventions carrying a distinctivly economic color. 
In handling relations with allies, the United States favors 
equal emphasis on cooperation and competition; that is, full 
cooperation in solving regional conflicts and expenditure and 
risk sharing among allies; but competition in economic fields to 
force allies to open up their markets. The United States also 
stresses the goal of controlling regional conflicts through the 
United Nations; different arrangements for security in different 
regions; and, above all, maintaining a powerful military 
presence in key conflict areas, such as the Middle East, viewed 
as a potential model for a regional security pattern.

<F P=106> [By reporters Sun Zhanlin (1327 0594 2651) and Hu Xiaoguang </F>
(5170 2556 0342)] 
  [Text] Almaty, 10 Jan (XINHUA) -- In an interview with a 
XINHUA NEWS AGENCY reporter on 10 Jan, General Nurmagambetov, 
Kazakh Minister of Defense, announced he will lead a Kazakh 
military delegation to pay a four-day official goodwill visit to 
China on 11 Jan. He stressed that the purposes of the visit 
were to get acquainted with Chinese military leaders and help 
"establish fraternal relations" between the armed forces of the 
two countries. 
  Nurmagambetov pointed out: China is a great neighbour of 
Kazakhstan. In his first visit to China as minister of defense, 
he will meet with his Chinese counterpart in order to establish 
dependable relations and deepen mutual understanding between the 
armed forces of the two countries. He hopes that the armed 
forces of Kazakhstan and China can learn from each other, share 
experiences, and watch each other's military exercises. 
  Speaking on Kazakhstan's army building, General 
Nurmagambetov 
said: The structure of Kazakhstan's armed forces is based on 
that of the former Soviet's forces in Kazakhstan. The military 
is not large-scale; however, it will be a well-equipped army 
with combat effectiveness. 
  General Nurmagambetov was born into a Kazakh family in 1924. 
Joining the army in 1942, he participated in the Great Patriotic 
War and was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. As a 
member of a delegation of former Soviet veterans, he visited 
China in 1991. He was appointed Kazakhstan's first minister of 
defense in May 1992.

and development in the world cannot be truly achieved. 
  Qian said China has always been attaching an importance to 
strengthening its relations with african countries. 
  "China is a developing country with a limited strength, but 
we always cherish a stand on Africa. That is not to neglect the 
problems appearing in Africa and at the same time respect the 
will of the African people," he added. 
  The two leaders also discussed the way of further 
strengthening and developing bilateral relations, with Meles 
saying Ethiopia welcomes Chinese businessmen to invest and 
create enterprises in Ethiopia.

their Ethiopian counterparts.

  [Text] Beijing, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese 
Vice-President Rong Yiren said here today that the Chinese 
Government would take into full consideration the nation's 
capability to endure reforms, and would handle properly the 
relationships between reforms, development and stability. 
  Rong made the remarks here today when meeting this morning 
with a Romanian Government delegation headed by Mircea Cosea, 
Romanian minister of state and president of the Council for 
Co-ordination, Strategy and Economic Reform. 
  On China's reform and opening-up, Rong said the past decade 
had witnessed tremendous changes in the country's economic 
system, the rapid growth of its economy and the significant 
lifting of its people's living standards. 
  Planning and the market were both means which should be 
fully 
tapped to boost the development of the country, Rong stressed. 
  "What we mean by building a socialist market economy is to 
incorporate the socialist system into the market economy, allow 
market mechanisms to play a fundamental role in allocating 
resources under the government's effective macro-control, and to 
achieve both efficiency and fairness in our development," Rong 
said. 
  On future reforms, Rong noted that China would, as before, 
take the step-by-step manner in adopting further reform measures. 
  Welcoming the delegation, Rong said the two governments and 
the two peoples had enjoyed traditional friendship and long-time 
cooperation. 
  He expressed the belief that the visit would deepen the 
mutual understanding and friendship between the two governments 
and the two peoples, and help to promote the exchanges and 
cooperation in the reforms of their economic systems. 
  Cosea said Romania is very interested in China's economic 
reform and achievements. 
  The Romanian Government hopes that the traditional 
friendship 
between the two peoples would be further developed and the 
cooperative ties in economic reform and trade be further 
enhanced, he said. 
  The Romanian visitors came here on Monday [10 January] at 
the 
invitation of the State Commission for Restructuring Economic 
Systems. Wu Jie, vice-minister of the commission, took part in 
the meeting.

  [Text] Belgrade, December 29 (XINHUA) -- Momcilo Perisic 
[name as received], chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav 
Armed Forces, today blamed foreign powers for the outbreak of 
the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In an interview with the Yugoslav TANJUG News Agency and the 
Army newspaper, VOJSKA, Perisic accused foreign powers of 
pursuing a policy of instigation of war in Bosnia, which was to 
a large extent successful in spreading the war. 
  Most of the European countries had supported the separatist 
forces in the former Yugoslavia and provided them with military 
assistance, the chief of the general staff said, adding that the 
world's biggest firearm salesmen and war Mafia had a hand in the 
Balkan war. 
  Perisic stressed that the superpowers, in seeking their 
strategic interests in the Balkans, had used their trump card of 
military force. Even the U.N. force had become a tool in their 
pursuit of these interests, he added. 
  The Yugoslav military chief warned that the civil war in 
Bosnia, once spreading to the whole region, would run beyond 
control and threaten the security of those countries which had 
helped splitting the former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Paris, January 13 (XINHUA) -- The restoration of 
Sino- French relations has been welcomed by President of the 
France-China Committee Francois de Villepin. 
  He told XINHUA today that the joint communique between the 
governments of China and France signaled that their relationship 
was over the worst and ushered in a new era. 
  In an interview with the official Chinese news agency, de 
Villepin said that Sino-French friendship, on the basis of the 
traditional principles on which the two countries established 
diplomatic relations, would provide for fresh advantages 
politically for bilateral trade and economic cooperation. 
  Reviewing the bilateral relationship, he said that China's 
pursuit of the reform and opening policy constructed by senior 
leader Deng Xiaoping had been a major event of the past 30 
years, ever since the two countries had forged diplomatic ties. 
  From the late 1970s, China has speeded up its international 
cooperation in trade and economy and secured one of the fastest 
economic growths in the world, the chairman said. 
  He added that increased bilateral cooperation could now be 
enjoyed in the future, alluding to low trade activities in the 
past. 
  During the first nine months of 1993, he told XINHUA, 
China's 
trade volume with France registered only a 33 percent increase, 
much lower than the 90 percent with Germany, 83 percent with 
Italy and 154 percent with Denmark. 
  During that period, France had lost potential trade with 
China worth a total of 6 billion francs (35.6 billion U.S. 
dollars), the France-China committee estimated. 
  De Villepin stressed that it is now in the two peoples' 
interest to improve their relationship and develop economic 
cooperation. 
  As permanent members of the United Nations, France and China 
should make efforts to help build a new world order and advance 
world peace and progress, de Villepin added.

  [Text] During an interview with a reporter of HSIANG KANG 
SHANG PAO [COMMERCIAL NEWSPAPER OF HONG KONG] on 12 January, 
Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
said: In 1993 Shandong Province realized sustained, 
accelerated, and healthy development in its economic 
construction thanks to the common efforts made by the people 
throughout the province. This year will be the year of reform, 
in which the province will enjoy many good opportunities and 
favorable conditions. The province's economy is estimated to 
remain at the accelerated rate of development. 
  The five-member group headed by (Ma Li), chief editor of 
HSIANG KANG SHANG PAO, and (Wu Xiyuan), executive deputy general 
manager and deputy chief editor of the Hong Kong newspaper, came 
to Jinan to attend the celebration sponsored by the office of 
DAZHONG RIBAO to mark the first anniversary of establishing a 
special column for the province in the Hong Kong newspaper. 
Over the past year, the Hong Kong newspaper has carried the 
special column on 54 pages of 25 issues in which the column has 
vividly introduced the fruitful achievements scored by our 
province in reform, opening up, and economic construction and 
played the role of a bridge or acted as a link in attracting 
outside business and investments. Reports in the special column 
have drawn attention and praise from the broad masses of 
overseas readers. 
  Accepting with pleasure the interviews with the reporters of 
the Hong Kong newspaper respectively on the morning and 
afternoon of 12 January were Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the 
provincial party committee; Li Chunting, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee and vice governor of the province; 
and Dong Fengji, member of the provincial party standing 
committee and director of the provincial propaganda department. 
  During the interview, Jiang Chunyun briefed the reporter on 
the province's situation in reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. He said: Over the past year the people 
throughout the province have closely integrated the spirit of 
central directives with the province's reality under the 
guidance of the socialist theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with 
regard to building socialism with Chinese characteristics. They 
have also seized the opportunity, deepened the reform, and 
correctly grasped or handled the contradictions cropping up in 
the economic operation, bringing about the sustained, 
accelerated, and healthy development of the province's economy. 
Undertakings in various fields have achieved new progress. 
Jiang Chunyun pointed out: In the course of establishing the 
systems of socialist market economy, it has been inevitable to 
encounter some problems and contradictions and we have discerned 
that in order to deal with the deep-rooted problems cropping up 
in the economic operation, it is imperative to rely on reform 
and to reinforce the strength in reform. Jiang Chunyun said: 
This year is the year of reforms, in which the state will 
concentrate on issuing a series of important measures for 
reforms that will deal with a wide range of things and whose 
tasks are arduous. He said: The current situation as a whole 
in the province is very fine. With the correct leadership of 
the CPC Central Committee, the foundation and experience gained 
in reform and opening up over the past 15 years, and the efforts 
made by the people throughout the province in positively and 
vigorously making progress, Shandong Province will certainly be 
able to improve its economy and various undertakings to a new 
level in the new year by further emancipating minds, truly 
grasping the reform, and doing practical deeds.

  [Excerpt] In 1993 the province's post and 
telecommunications departments upheld the principle of carrying 
out standardized construction on the one hand, and doing a good 
job in rendering post and telecommunications services in line 
with the local economic development on the other hand. Thus, an 
unprecedented and good situation has prevailed in the province's 
post and telecommunications business. By the end of 1993, the 
post and telecommunications departments throughout the province 
realized 2.75 billion yuan of business volume, which showed a 
76 percent increase over 1992. The increased scale has 
surpassed the national average level in this regard by 17.3 
percent. The development speed has also enabled the province to 
enter the forefront of the nation in this regard. Our province 
has, to date, improved its actual economic strength as a whole, 
its comprehensive economic strength, and brought the service 
standard on its post and telecommunications front to a new level. 
  Attending the provincial work conference held in Jinan on 11 
January on the affairs of post and telecommunication were Jiang 
Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee; Zhao 
Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and 
governor of the province; and Chen Jianguo, member of the 
provincial party standing committee and vice governor of the 
province. At the work conference, they extended congratulations 
on the tremendous achievements scored by the post and 
telecommunications departments across the province and expressed 
their thanks for the tremendous contributions made to developing 
the economy in the province by the staff members and workers on 
the post and telecommunications front. 
  In his speech Jiang Chunyun said: Since orienting its post 
and telecommunications business onto the high-speed track of 
development in 1988, our province has scored marked achievements 
in the development that has made great contributions in 
accelerating the economic development in the province, 
broadening the opening up, and making things convenient for the 
people's production and livelihood. Current tasks for building 
socialism have entered a new historic period that has set forth 
new demands for the post and telecommunications front. In order 
to boost the economy, communications on the post and 
telecommunications front should go ahead of others. If we 
should do a lot in economic construction, we should first do a 
lot in the post and telecommunications aspect. He urged cadres, 
staff members, and workers on the province's post and 
telecommunications front to carry forward their achievements, to 
advance on the crest of success, and to meet the needs of 
economic construction and the people's livelihood. 
  During the work conference, Governor Zhao Zhihao and Vice 
Governor Chen Jianguo also delivered a speech. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jinan, January 13 (XINHUA) -- East China's Shandong 
Province has made remarkable progress in the development of 
posts and telecommunications over the past year. 
  According to official statistics, a total of some 2.48 
billion yuan (about 285 million U.S. dollars) was earned by 
postal and telecommunication service last year, 73 percent more 
than in 1992. 
  Over the past year, the province has expanded its microwave 
and optical fibre cable lines by 1,837 kilometers and 946 
kilometers, respectively. 
  In addition, international satellite communication has been

Korea. 
  Some 15,000 long-distance telephone lines have been opened, 
increasing the number of such lines in the province to 33,000, 
81 percent of which are automatically controlled. 
  All cities and 67 counties in the province have established 
program-controlled telephone systems, and program-controlled 
switchboards with 395,000 lines were opened last year. 
  Consequently, the number of telephone users in the province

million U.S. dollars) last year, ranking second in China's 
postal service. 
  Officials said that more than 3.1 billion yuan (about 356 
million U.S. dollars) have been invested in the construction of 
postal services over the past year, four times the 1992 sum.

<F P=106> [Work report of the Shandong Provincial CPC Discipline </F>
Inspection Commission given to the Sixth Shandong Provincial CPC 
Congress on 23 November] 
  [Excerpts] The following report on the work of the Shandong 
Provincial CPC Discipline Inspection Commission carried out in 
the past five years is now given to the sixth provincial party 
congress for its discussion. 
<H5>  Major Work in the Past Five Years </H5>
  Under the correct leadership of the provincial party 
committee and the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the 
provincial discipline inspection commission and discipline 
inspection commissions at all levels took Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th party congress as 
guidance, comprehensively implemented the party's basic line, 
persistently regarded economic construction as the central task, 
continued the explorations on new ways of doing discipline 
inspection work to meet the needs of the new situation of reform 
and opening up, strived to fulfill the tasks entrusted by the 
party Constitution, conscientiously performed discipline 
inspection functions, completed a great amount of work for 
safeguarding party discipline, punishing corruption, improving 
party style, and building a clean government, and made positive 
contributions to the smooth progress of Shandong's economic 
construction, reform, and opening up. 
  1. We made unremitting efforts in improving party style and 
building a clean government and remain resolute in serving the 
basic line. 
  It has always been the guiding thought for discipline 
inspection organs to improve party style, build a clean 
government, and ensure implementation of the party's basic line 
with the focus firmly placed on economic construction, the 
central task. In the past few years, discipline inspection 
commissions at all levels persistently emancipated the mind, 
sought truth from facts, and coordinated discipline inspection 
work closely with reform, opening up, economic development, and 
the endeavor of safeguarding stability and unity in line with 
the requirements of the provincial party committee and the 
Central Discipline Inspection Commission. To counter the 
conspicuous contradictions in inner-party life and economic 
activities, we studied and adopted preventive measures from the 
perspective of safeguarding party regulations and party laws and 
improving party style, conscientiously solved budding problems 
and tendencies, strived to ensure social and political 
stability, and provided a good environment for developing the 
economy and establishing the socialist market economy system. 
  Proceeding from maintaining close party-populace ties and 
boosting the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for reform and 
construction, we made efforts to promote party style and build a 
clean government. While concentrating efforts on economic 
construction, the fifth provincial party committee regarded the 
endeavor to punish corruption and advocate honesty as a major 
task. In early 1989, it held an on-the-spot meeting in Changle 
on "persisting in the party's purpose and maintaining honesty in 
administration," which was participated in by city, prefectural, 
and county major responsible persons. The meeting summarized 
and disseminated the experiences in making administrative work 
public and promoting honesty in party and government organs and 
put forward new requirements for the province on improving party 
style and building a clean government. Discipline inspection 
commissions at all levels made active efforts to help party 
committees in promoting honesty and diligence in administration, 
establishing systems for maintaining honesty, and strengthening 
the supervision by the masses. They popularized such systems as 
"making work procedures and work results public for the scrutiny 
of the masses" and "appraising governments' functional 
departments," thus gradually systematizing the endeavors to 
improve party style and build a clean government. 
  We strictly enforced the party's political discipline to 
safeguard social stability. In 1989 when there was a political 
storm in the country and the international situation was 
abruptly changing, discipline inspection commissions at all 
levels and the vast number of discipline inspection cadres took 
a firm and clear-cut stand and resolutely implemented the 
instructions of the central authorities and the provincial party 
committee, displaying their firm party spirit and organizational 
discipline. The provincial discipline inspection commission 
issued a timely circular to state party discipline. Discipline 
inspection commissions at all levels also put forward demands 
and coordinated with pertinent departments to conduct 
examinations. They played an important role in defending party 
discipline, consolidating, and developing the stable and united 
political situation, and ensuring unity of party organizations 
and party-member cadres with the party Central Committee. 
[passage omitted] 
  2. We made particular efforts to investigate and handle 
discipline breaches and strictly enforced party discipline. 
  Adhering to the principle of managing the party strictly, 
discipline inspection commissions at all levels "made particular 
efforts to investigate and handle discipline breaches within the 
party and comprehensively perform the discipline inspection 
function." Starting with discipline enforcement and handling of 
cases to achieve breakthroughs in opposing corruption, we 
particularly investigated and handled serious violation of 
political discipline, such economic cases as embezzlement and 
bribery, abuse of power for selfish gains, bureaucracy, cases on 
dereliction of duty, smuggling, sale of smuggled goods, and 
violation of socialist morality and eliminated a number of 
corrupt elements. In the past five years, we investigated and 
handled 92,105 discipline breaches within the party and punished 
77,112 party members, of whom 12,891 were expelled from the 
party, 21,453 were placed on probation, and 2.156 were dismissed 
from party posts. Among the punished party members, 445 were 
cadres at the county and section level, and 24 were cadres at 
the departmental and bureau level. By investigating and 
handling these cases, we strictly enforced party discipline, 
educated party-member cadres, and purified party organizations. 
[passage omitted] 
  3. We launched special improvement endeavor to correct 
unhealthy trends. 
  Based on reality and by doing practical work, we followed 
party leadership and coordinated with pertinent departments to 
tackle and correct the unhealthy trends that seriously affected 
economic construction, reform, and opening up that interfered 
with the implementation of party principles and policies and of 
which the masses were most dissatisfied with. We carried out 
this work by concentrating efforts on tackling one or two 
unhealthy trends at a time. In the past five years, we dealt 
with the party and government cadres who violated laws and 
discipline in housing construction, recovered more than 20 
million illicit funds, meted out economic sanctions on 13,000 
persons, and punished 258 persons according to disciplinary 
actions. We made conscientious efforts to correct the unhealthy 
trends in some trades. Focusing on 11 trades, such as public 
security, industry and commerce, and public health, we conducted 
education to straighten out problems. We investigated and 
handled 2,050 cases on abuse of power for selfish gains; put an 
end to some unwarranted pooling of funds, wanton requisition of 
donations, and exaction of fees to reduce the financial burden 
totaling 780 million yuan on enterprises and peasants; 
straightened out rural chaotic financial management, clarified 
360 million yuan of debts receivable and debts payable, and 
returned 130 million yuan; examined and collected 169 million 
yuan of public funds owed by 115,000 staff members and workers; 
and corrected the mistake of 46 departments that violated 
regulations to provide clothes to their staff members and 
workers. We also examined and straightened out the use of 
personnel, financial, and material resources of enterprises 
without compensation, use of public funds for the education of 
one's children, and lavish wining and dining with public 
expenses. Based on their own characteristics, discipline 
inspection commissions at all levels also persistently 
coordinated the effort to check unhealthy trends with that to 
straighten out discipline and coordinated ideological education 
with improvement of systems to continuously consolidate and 
expand the achievements in checking unhealthy trends. 
  4. We strengthened supervision and inspection to ensure the 
smooth implementation of government orders. 
  Focusing on ensuring reform and opening up and facilitating 
the establishment of the socialist market economy system, 
discipline inspection commissions at all levels strengthened 
supervision and inspection of the implementation of the party's 
line, principles, and policies, state laws and regulations, and 
major reform measures, and strived to solve the problems that 
"orders and prohibitions were not carried out." [passage 
omitted] 
  In view of the problems discovered during the supervision 
and 
inspection, we held several theoretical symposiums to formulate 
policy standards to meet actual needs. In the past few years, 
the provincial discipline inspection commission formulated 10 
policies to support and protect reform, five requirements to 
improve party style and build a clean government, 14 opinions to 
promote enforcement of the "regulations," and 10 regulations to 
maintain the honesty of party and government organs. All of 
them were approved and transmitted by the provincial party 
committee and government in a timely manner, which not only 
helped standardize the activities of party-member cadres but 
also provided a policy base for the supervision and inspection 
and for strict enforcement of discipline. 
  5. We successfully conducted education on party style and 
party discipline based on reality. 
  In line with the requirement put forward by the provincial 
discipline inspection commission for "paying attention to both 
handling of cases and education," discipline inspection 
commissions at all levels conscientiously implemented the 
principle of "putting education and prevention first" and 
adopted effective measures to intensify the education on party 
style and party discipline to address the problems in party 
member's thinking about reform, opening up, and development of 
the socialist market economy. They coordinated with pertinent 
departments to launch one large education activity every year. 
They conducted the education for party members throughout the 
province to "study party Constitution and correct party style," 
"study party regulations and laws," "oppose corruption and 
prevent degeneration," and "study party Constitution, stress 
dedication, and be qualified party members." More than 90 of 
the party members received the education. [passage omitted] 
  6. We improved the contingent of discipline inspection 
workers with the spirit of reform. 
  Party committees and discipline inspection commissions at 
all 
levels attached great importance to improving the contingent of 
discipline inspection workers. They organized the vast number 
of discipline inspection cadres to conscientiously study Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, the market economy, and modern scientific and 
technological knowledge. On-the-job study and special training 
enabled the cadres to continuously improve their political 
quality and professional competence. Meanwhile, in line with 
the "four requirements" on cadres, we selected a number of 
cadres in the prime of life who have both political integrity 
and ability to replenish the leading bodies of discipline 
inspection commissions. In line with the requirements of the 
party Central Committee and the provincial party committee, we 
changed the sections of discipline inspection organs into 
offices and provided cadres according to regulations. We 
conducted exchange of discipline inspection cadres in a planned 
manner to invigorate the contingent. We established and 
improved the discipline inspection organizations in enterprises, 
institutions, towns, and townships. We launched provincewide 
activities to "learn from, emulate, and surpass the advanced and 
vie to be loyal guards of the party" to promote the 
self-improvement of the discipline inspection contingent. The 
vast number of discipline inspection cadres adhered to 
principles, advanced despite difficulties, remained honest in 
performing duties, worked hard, displayed good morality and 
brand-new mental outlook, and created a large number of advanced 
examples. Fifteen persons of the province were named as 
national outstanding discipline inspection cadres, and two 
discipline inspection commissions (group) were named as national 
advanced discipline inspection organizations. The provincial 
discipline inspection commission commended 48 advanced 
discipline inspection organizations and 250 outstanding 
discipline inspection cadres. 
  In line with the decision of the party Central Committee and 
the State Council on merging the offices of discipline 
inspection and supervision organs, the provincial discipline 
inspection and supervision organs began to do so in March this 
year and completed this work in three months. This work 
represented a major reform of the supervision system of the 
party and government. It helped strengthen the discipline 
inspection and supervision functions under unified party 
leadership, helped the government strengthen leadership over 
supervision work, helped avoid overlapping of work, and helped 
streamline organs and personnel. All discipline inspection 
organs carried out this work in a steady and discreet manner, 
thus achieving unity and pooling efforts. Working in the same 
office, discipline inspection organs and supervision organs 
became one organ which performed two functions. In this way, 
they raised work quality and efficiency and strengthened both 
the discipline inspection and the supervision functions. 
  Thanks to the concerted efforts of party organizations at 
all 
levels and the vast number of party members in the province, 
notable results were achieved in the party's discipline 
inspection work and in improving party style and building a 
clean government in the past five years. Most party members and 
cadres were honest in performing duties, and the main aspects of 
party style were good. However, we should also remain 
clear-headed to note the large number of negative and corrupt 
phenomena and the very arduous tasks to oppose corruption. Some 
party organizations and leading cadres with party membership 
lacked an understanding of the necessity and urgency of the 
anticorruption struggle and failed to properly handle the 
relationship between the endeavor of opposing corruption and 
advocating honesty and the endeavor of economic development, 
reform, and opening up. Discipline enforcement was not strict 
enough in some areas. Some leading cadres with party membership 
had a weak sense of organization and discipline and failed to 
act as an example. On the part of the provincial discipline 
inspection commission, its concepts, work methods, and 
leadership style were incompatible with the needs of the new 
situation and new tasks; and it failed to work in a creative 
manner and provide effective guidance and assistance to 
lower-level discipline inspection commissions. We should solve 
these problems when carrying out in the future. [passage

  [Text] Shanghai, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The establishment 
of major markets in China's largest economic center has proved 
successful, according to municipal officials. 
  "The ten newly-opened exchanges are becoming a mainstay of 
Shanghai's economic development," a municipal official said. 
  The exchanges involved the fields of securities, metals, 
coal, farm production materials and equipment, chemicals, grain 
and edible oil, motor vehicles, building materials and 
technology. 
  Opened since 1990, the markets expanded their operations 
quickly to other parts of the country, with the total 
transactions reaching 1,000 billion yuan-worth in 1993. 
  A survey shows that Shanghai's gross domestic product last 
year went up by 14 percent. More than 90 percent of the 60 
million tons of important materials including metals, fuel oil 
and coal, which it consumed last year, were supplied by the new 
markets. 
  Through the local securities market, 92 enterprises in the 
city have issued stocks to the public. 
  Linking itself with the international and domestic markets, 
the Shanghai metals exchange succeeded in reining in price hikes 
last year. 
  According to the official, as most prices on the ten 
exchanges are constant, these markets are playing an influential 
role in regulating production and operation of many enterprises 
in the country and leading them toward the international market. 
  The official disclosed that Shanghai is preparing to open 
nationwide exchanges for foreign currency and gold. 
  With these markets playing a greater role in the allocation 
of resources and hooking up with the international market, 
economists here agree, Shanghai's economy will continue to 
develop at a rapid and healthy pace.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 13 (XINHUA) -- The year 1994 will 
turn out to be a good year of development for the Pudong New 
Area, according to Shanghai's Deputy Mayor Zhao Qizheng. 
  Zhao, also chairman of Pudong's Administrative Committee, 
told a press conference that 2.5 billion yuan will be invested 
in ten key infrastructure projects in the area, including a 
1.5-sq-km park, the expansion of schools, and a boulevard in the 
Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone. 
  Unmarked on a sizable map only three years ago, the Pudong 
area, covering 518 sq km on the east bank of the Huangpu River, 
has become a symbol of and a bridgehead for Shanghai's comeback 
as an economic and financial center for the Asia and Pacific 
region. 
  Therefore, construction of its infrastructure has to be 
top-flight from the very beginning, Zhao said. 
  Statistics show that in 1993 the area recorded an output 
value of 16.4 billion yuan, double that for 1990. The figure is 
also up 30.2 percent over 1992, and 15.3 percentage points 
higher than the growth rate for the area on the river's west 
bank. 
  Last year Pudong had 16 billion yuan-worth of fixed assets, 
far surpassing the 7.5 billion yuan for 1992. Its revenue 
growth was 60 percent, and 924 foreign-funded projects were 
approved by the local government in the same year. 
  So far, with a total investment of 15 billion yuan, the 
first 
ten projects, involving transportation, energy and 
telecommunications, have been completed, two years ahead of 
schedule. 
  Thanks to this, the skeleton of a modern metropolis has 
taken 
shape, especially on the 50 sq km of developed land which 
embraces the Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone, Waigaoqiao 
Free-Trade Zone, Jinqiao Export-Processing Zone and Zhangjiang 
Hi-Tech Zone. 
  In 1.7-sq-km Lujiazui, which aims to become the largest 
business center in China, construction of 50 financial and 
commercial office buildings has begun, with a total floor space 
of over two million sq m, and work on another 30 buildings 
designed to be up to the world advanced level will start within 
this year. 
  According to the blueprint, by the end of this century 150 
large buildings will come into existence in Lujiazui. 
  So far, 20 out of the top 100 world conglomerates have set 
up 
branches in Pudong. In the Jinqiao District there are 202 
foreign-invested projects, financed to the tune of an average of 
some 13 million U.S. dollars each. 
  Zhao said that by the year 2000 Pudong will expand its 
development area by another 60 sq km, with the urbanized area 
reaching more than 100 sq km.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liang Jun: "Shanghai Receives Top-Notch </F>
Mobile Phone System"] 
  [Text] The world's most advanced mobile phone system has 
just been introduced to Shanghai. 
  Motorola's high-capacity electronic mobile switching system 
has been working well since Shanghai Posts and 
Telecommunications Administration began trial operations last 
month. 
  Shanghai is the first city in China to introduce such a 
sophisticated mobile phone system. Beijing officials also 
signed an agreement last year with Motorola to buy the system, 
called EMX 2500. 
  Motorola, an American company has sold the cutting-edge 
system to many countries. 
  More than 120 Chinese cities currently use cellular phone 
switch systems made by Motorola. 
  The introduction of the larger-capacity system to Shanghai 
will triple the possible number of mobile phone users in the 
city. 
  Pertti Johanson, Vice President and General Manager of 
Motorola's International Cellular Infrastructure Division, said 
that the software of the EMX 2500 in operation in Shanghai has 
been modified to better meet the requirements of China's 
telecommunications networks. 
  He added the introduction of the large-capacity switch 
system 
in Shanghai will not only enhance call processing speed, but 
also lay a solid foundation for the network and capacity to 
expand. 
  According to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, 
China had about 638,000 mobile phone subscribers at the end of 
last year, with many applicants waiting for phones. 
  The ministry plans to increase the total number of mobile 
phone users to between 900,000 and 1 million by the end of this 
year. 
  In another development, Motorola China Inc has decided to 
invest nearly $200 million this year in the Tianjin Economic and 
Technological Development Area (TEDA). 
  See Peng Hong, chief representative of Motorola China Inc, 
said in Tianjin that he had full confidence in the areas 
investment environment and China's economic reforms. 
  The company has now set up two factories in the Tianjin area 
since March 1992. The first factory assembles pagers, making 
about 40 percent of Motorola's digital radio pagers on the 
Chinese market.
