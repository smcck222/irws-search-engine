  [Text] The provincial economic work conference was held in 
Shenyang on 18 January. Governor Yue Qifeng made a speech 
entitled "Clearly Understand the New Situation and Seize the New 
Opportunity to Win New Victory in the Second Pioneering 
Program." In his speech, he set forth general demanda for this 
year's economic work, that is, to deepen reform, expand opening 
up, and improve the quality of economic operations by 
accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economy 
in order to ensure that the national economic plan is fulfilled 
and new victory in the second pioneering program is won this 
year. 
  Yue Qifeng said: The most conspicuous characteristics of 
this year's economic situation are: The province is about to 
make a big step in reform; in macroeconomy, the state is about 
to carry out reforms in finance and tax, banking, foreign trade, 
investment, and management of state-owned assets; and in 
microeconomy, the province is about to make a substantive step 
in changing the mechanisms of enterprises with the purpose of 
establishing a modern enterprise system. This year, we will not 
only face the old problems of conspicuous structural 
contradictions, stagnated technological transformation, heavy 
historical burdens, low economic efficiency, and extensive 
management but will also meet new problems in carrying out new 
major reform measures. The mix of new and old contradictions 
will impose a rigorous test on the province's economic 
development. 
  Yue Qifeng said: Whether we can achieve new and even greater 
progress in the economy this year depends primarily on whether 
we can make a big breakthrough in reform. Therefore, in 
conducting economic work in 1994, we should not only give 
prominence to reform by regarding it as the major line running 
through the whole process, but also persist in the idea that 
only development constitutes the essential criterion, seize the 
new opportunity, face up to new challenges, and achieve new 
progress. We should not only give prominence to grasping the 
focal and difficult points of economic work and continue to run 
large and medium-sized enterprises well but also energetically 
cultivate and develop new economic growth points. 
  Yue Qifeng said: The tasks on reform, opening up, and 
economic construction we face this year will be very arduous, 
and the reform measures to be set forth this year will be more 
numerous, extensive, profound, and difficult than those set 
forth in any of the past dozen of years. This has set on us a 
demand higher than those set on us in the past. To adapt 
ourselves to the new situation, leaders at all levels must 
conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping and must further emancipate the mind, enhance 
spirit, change the style of work, and truly attend to work. So 
long as our minds are emancipated, our road of development is 
set correctly, and our work is practical, we will certainly 
realize sustained, rapid, and sound development in the national 
economy and win new victory in the second pioneering program. 
  The conference was presided over by Xiao Zuofu, vice 
governor 
of the province. Vice Governor Wen Shizhen relayed the 
guidelines of the national economic work conference. Attending 
the conference were provincial leaders Gu Jinchi, Wang Huaiyuan, 
Shang Wen, Li Guozhong, Yu Junbo, Cong Zhenglong, Gao Guozhu, 
and Xu De.

  [Text] As learned by this reporter from the provincial 
economic work conference held on 18 January, rapid growth was 
effected in the province's economy last year, new changes took 
place in old economic patterns, and new gratifying results were 
achieved in the second pioneering program, so that last year 
showed the best economic development results since the beginning 
of the 1990's. Last year, the province's GNP was estimated at 
179 billion yuan, an increase of 13.5 percent over the previous 
year; a bumper harvest was reaped in all crops with a total 
grain output of 16.96 billion kg, a record high; and the total 
industrial output value was estimated at 279.4 billion yuan, an 
increase of 28.2 percent over the previous year if calculated in 
terms of comparable prices. A new leap was effected in the new 
economic growing point, with township and town enterprises as 
the mainstay. Such enterprises fulfilled the targets set by the 
Eighth Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule. The scale of 
opening up was expanded further. There were 7,895 foreign-funded 
enterprises of the three types in the province. The building of 
infrastructure and technological transformation was sped up. 
  Last year, new changes took place in the province's old 
economic patterns. First, new changes took place in the pattern 
of urban and rural economies. The proportion of the total 
product of the rural society in the province's total product of 
society rose from 29.8 percent in 1989 to 42.4 percent in 1993. 
Second, new changes took place in the pattern of large and 
small industries. The proportion of total output value of the 
industry at or below the county level in the province's total 
industrial output value rose from 37.6 percent in 1989 to 47.5 
percent. The ratio between output value of large enterprises 
and small enterprises changed from 53:47 to 45:55. Third, new 
changes took place in the public and private sector's pattern. 
Output value of the province's non-state-owned industry was 
143.7 billion yuan, accounting for 51.4 percent of the total 
industrial output value of the province. This is a first in 
Liaoning history. Fourth, new changes took place in the pattern 
of financial revenue. Last year, about 70 percent of the 
increase in the province's revenues were from township and town 
enterprises, newly rising economy, the tertiary industry, 
individual and private sectors of the economy, and the three 
types of foreign-funded enterprises.

  [Text] The provincial economic work conference held its 
second meeting on the afternoon of 19 January. Vice Governor 
Wen Shizhen presided over the meeting. Gu Jinchi, secretary of 
the provincial party committee, made an important speech, 
entitled "Emancipate the Mind, Strengthen Leadership, and Strive 
To Effect Sustained, Rapid, and Sound Development in Liaoning's 
Economy." 
  Gu Jinchi pointed out: At present, the province is 
confronted with the following opportunities at least in 
accelerating reform and development. First, although the 
commencement of the series of state reform measures in finance 
and tax, banking, investment, and foreign trade will inevitably 
bring us some difficulties and clashes, these measures, when 
viewed from the point of view of overall interest, will be 
favorable to the province's development, and, in particular, 
will bring us an extremely good opportunity to invigorate large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, to renovate old 
industrial bases, to readjust the structures of industries and 
products, and to develop foreign economic relations and trade. 
Second, at present the investment made in China by foreign 
firms, in particular by some large foreign enterprises and 
financial groups that enjoy high popularity and have solid 
strength, is gradually moving northwards, the state strategy for 
developing the Bohai Economic Circle area has been carried out 
further, and the economic exchanges and cooperation among 
various countries in Northeast Asia have become closer and 
closer. All these have provided the province with an extremely 
favorable opportunity to further expand the scale of opening up 
and to energetically develop an export-oriented economy. Third, 
although the new economic growing points defined by the province 
have witnessed relatively good progress over the past few years, 
there is still tremendous potential. And, these new growth 
points may enter the market rapidly, thus constituting an 
extremely good opportunity to develop the province freely. 
Fourth, the market network that has already been shaped 
throughout the province's urban and rural areas, and, in 
particular, the market of means of subsistence, which ranks 
among the country's best in business volume and popularity, have 
provided extensive and very convenient market conditions for the 
province's textile, light industry, and foodstuff trades, which 
are in dire straits. 
  Gu Jinchi said: It is not our purpose to understand 
opportunity. What is important is to seize the opportunity to 
develop ourselves. This is the only way for us to gain even 
greater initiative amid the waves of the new round of reform and 
opening up. This year, we should emphatically achieve marked 
results in the following three aspects: 1) Enterprise reform, 
the reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in 
particular; 2) rural reform; and 3) the building of market 
system. We should correctly handle the relations between reform 
and development, between speed and efficiency, between key 
projects and non-key projects, and between economic work and 
political work and should strengthen and improve leadership over 
economic work in order to provide a powerful and effective 
political guarantee for accelerating the province's economic 
development. 
  Gu Jinchi stressed: To effect a rapid progress in Liaoning's 
economy, we should pay attention to the following issues: 
First, we should firmly embrace the idea that development is 
the only essential criterion. Second, we should firmly embrace 
the new ideas and new concepts that are suitable for the 
socialist market economy and should be brave in and good at 
obtaining and creating even more favorable conditions for 
economic development. Third, we should firmly embrace hardwork 
and the pioneering spirit of making unremitting efforts to 
improve ourselves and should combine the spirit of being daring 
to try and go ahead with the scientific spirit of seeking truth 
and doing concrete work. Fourth, all professions and trades 
should consciously submit and orient themselves to the central 
task of economic construction and give rise to a joint force to 
grasp economic construction in order to promote the rapid 
development of the province's economy. 
  Attending the meeting were leaders of the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government, including Yue Qifeng, 
Wang Huaiyuan, Zhang Guoguang, Shang Wen, Li Guozhong, Yu Junbo, 
Xu Wencai, Xiao Zuofu, Cong Zhenglong, and Gao Guozhu.

  [Text] It was learned from the provincial economic 
structural reform work conference held today that in 1993 our 
province achieved breakthrough progress in reform of the 
enterprise property right system and the pricing system and in 
organizational reform and reform of the housing system. Rural 
reform, market construction and reform of the social security 
system as well as macroeconomic regulation and control were 
unceasingly developed and improved. 
  In 1993, our province comprehensively implemented the 
regulations on enterprise law, accelerated the change of 
operational mechanism of enterprises and took active and 
reliable steps to promote the experiment of shareholding system 
in some selected units. By the end of the year, 814 enterprises 
had experimented with the shareholding system. In addition, 
such reform measures as the overall contract of input and 
output, the introduction of mechanism of the three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises and grafting and transformation of 
old enterprises had been gradually carried out in the whole 
province, enabling a great number of enterprises to strengthen 
economic vitality. While successfully running state- owned 
enterprises, the whole province actively developed the 
collective economy, township enterprises, three types of 
foreign- funded enterprises, and the private and individual 
economies, enabling our province's economic structure to witness 
a historical change. Of the whole province's total industrial 
output value, of which, 40 percent came from the non-state 
economic sector. 
  Last year our province unceasingly improved its market 
system. A pluralistic and multilayered pattern of markets for 
daily industrial products and farm and sideline products with 
large-scale markets as the center, medium-sized and small 
comprehensive wholesale and integrated wholesale and retail 
markets as the support and all sorts of urban and rural 
commodity markets as a network had been basically formed. 
  In 1993, reform of the insurance system with old-age, 
unemployment, and medical insurances as the main body had been 
gradually expanded to cover many social sectors, and the degree 
of socialization was enhanced. The pace in housing reform was 
accelerated. The housing reform plans of 14 cities across the 
province had all been approved, and most of them had been put 
into practice. In changing government functions and improving 
the macroeconomic regulation and control system, the whole 
province also implemented a series reform measures. The 
provincial government and its subordinate departments delegated 
a total of more than 400 economic management powers regarding 
the investment in fixed assets, foreign economic relation and 
trade, banking and commodity prices to the lower levels in an 
effort to strengthen and improve the macroeconomic regulation 
and control and social service functions.

  [Text] At the provincial economic work conference held on 
20 January, Cao Guixing, chairman of the provincial Economic 
Commission, proposed that our province should particularly grasp 
well the following few tasks in this year's economic work: 
  First, we should deepen enterprise reform, clearly define 
the 
property right relations, further change the enterprise 
operational mechanism, improve and promote five types of asset 
operational forms with an emphasis in grasping the shareholding 
system, grafting and transformation, and the work of improving 
and developing enterprise groups, and reorganize some 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises by introducing 
the company system to them in a planned manner. Second, we 
should work painstaking to improve the internal situation, 
strengthen management, accelerate the pace of linking 
enterprises with the market economic system, give prominence to 
basic management, run the plants in line with law, do a good job 
in coordinating the contracting system and the new tax system, 
and train and cultivate a number of enterprises which are good 
in mechanism, management and efficiency across the province. 
Third, we should readjust the product mix and accelerate the 
pace of technological progress in enterprises. This year the 
whole province should pay attention to the guidance of 
information policies and market funds, give prominence to major 
products and key enterprises, persist in systematically 
transforming the supporting high and new technology products, 
create the best economic efficiency, cultivate a new image of 
Liaoning's industry and form new industrial advantages in

oriented products, and technical upgrading of old industrial 
enterprises. 
  As the political, cultural and international exchange center 
of the country, Beijing made marked progress in industrial 
output value, house construction and profits made by the service 
sector last year. 
  The city is also the country's biggest hub of 
communications. 
It has 19 railway lines with a total annual handling capacity 
of over 45 million tons, and 2,037 highways with a total length

  [Text] Beijing, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will quicken 
its personnel management system reform this year to keep up with 
the socialist market economy being established in the country, 
according to an official of the municipal government. 
  Addressing a meeting Thursday [20 January], Zhang Baifa, an 
executive deputy mayor of Beijing, said that the reform of 
personnel management is one of the most crucial measures to be 
taken this year to promote economic development and bring the 
potential of civil servants in the municipal organizations into 
full play. 
  The capital's personnel management system reform aims at 
restructuring government organizations, putting the civil 
service system into practice and speeding up the wage system 
reform in government organizations, the deputy mayor said. 
  The municipal government will work hard to achieve a healthy 
development of the city's center where talented people can seek 
new and suitable jobs. 
  The capital will also speed up the social insurance system 
reform in municipal government organizations so as to maintain 
social stability and guarantee personnel management reform. 
  In addition, effective measures will be taken to enable 
large 
and medium-sized state-run enterprises and the rural areas of 
the capital to stem the brain drain, Zhang said.

  [Text] Judging by the entire situation, the province has 
not fundamentally cast away the personnel affairs pattern 
formulated under the old economic system, though the party and 
government organs at all levels throughout the province have 
been readjusted over the past few years and work has been done 
to control the growth of organs and staff size. The problems of 
overstaffed organizations, duplication of functions, uneven 
relations, and low efficiency still exist in the province. It 
is time for us to conduct reform and to deal with these problems 
fundamentally. 
  According to the station reporter's dispatch from the 
provincial personnel affairs work conference that concluded on 
15 January, the major tasks the province adopted to cope with 
the aforementioned problems are to push forward in an overall 
way reform of organs; to establish gradually or enforce the 
system of public servants; to conduct vigorous reform of the 
wages systems of organs, establishments, and units and to orient 
the wages systems to an enforcement track; to promote reform of 
the system of social insurance in organs, establishments, and 
units; to deepen reform of personnel affairs systems of 
enterprises and establishments; to actively establish or improve 
the managerial and service systems for talented personnel; and 
to enhance the management over the affairs of specialized and 
technical cadres. In successfully conducting reform of organs 
and enforcing the system of public servants, emphasis should be 
placed on successfully grasping the connection between the 
reform of organs and the enforcement of public servant systems. 
First, we should do a good job in conducting definition in the 
following three fields: 1) The definition of organs functions; 
2) The definition of organs names; and 3) The definition of 
staff size. We should be determined to deal with the 
long-standing problems of disputes over trifles that exist among 
economic departments and between the comprehensive economic 
departments and the specialized economic departments. Second, we 
should carry out personnel transfers and do a good job in 
shifting the function of departments. A central task in this 
regard is to establish a demarcation line, under the socialist 
market economy system, between things that must be controlled by 
the state and those that should not be controlled, and to deal 
correctly with the relationship between them. Streamlining the 
staff size of organs and transferring personnel constitute a 
difficult point in reforming organs and is a premise of 
enforcing the system of public servants. In line with the 
demands of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and 
the province's situation, the party and government organs at or 
above the county level across the province should carry out a 
personnel cut of 35,000. This is a quite arduous task and 
requires us to do a good job in deeply and carefully conducting 
ideological and political work among personnel and to enable the 
broad masses of cadres, staff members, and workers to adopt a 
correct attitude toward the new appointments and dismissals by 
realizing it is necessary in order to build Hebei into a strong 
economic province. We should try to have the reappointees be 
relaxed and greeted with pleasure by the outgoing personnel. 
  The provincial party committee and the provincial people's 
government have decided that the province will basically 
complete the reform of organs by the end of 1995 and the work of 
enforcing the systems of public servants by the end of 1996. 
Tasks for the two reform projects are very arduous. Meanwhile, 
they have also made specific arrangements for the reform of the 
wage systems.

<F P=106> [By Wang Dongmei (3769 0392 2734): "The Autonomous Region </F>
Holds Conference on Judicial and State Security Work"] 
  [Text] On 29 December, the autonomous regional party 
committee held a regional conference on judicial and state 
security work. 
  Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee, 
presided 
over the conference and gave a speech. Wu Liji, deputy 
secretary of the regional party committee and chairman of the 
region, made a speech on doing a good job in the region's 
judicial and state security work in line with the region's 
realities. Wang Zhan, deputy secretary of the regional party 
committee, relayed the guidelines of the national conference on 
judicial and public security work. 
  Qian Fenyong, Geriletu, and Wuyunqimuge attended the 
conference. 
  In his speech, Wang Qun pointed out: Development is our 
purpose, reform is the motivation for development, and unity and 
stability are the essential prerequisites for reform and 
development. Regarding stability as an overriding task is 
precisely to ensure development. Reform, development, and 
stability are mutually conditional. The region's political, 
cadre, and work foundations are good and are based on the good 
tradition of national unity. The current overall situation is 
also very good and are favorable to reform and development. 
However, leaders at all levels should remain sober-minded and 
should understand that some factors affecting social stability 
also exist. Therefore, we should strengthen party leadership 
and strengthen ideological education for cadres and the masses. 
Leaders of party committees and governments at all levels 
should all persist in the fundamental principle of taking a 
two-handed approach and being tough with both hands," that is, 
they should not only pay attention to economic construction, but 
also to building spiritual civilization. We should unite the 
ideas of the whole party and the whole society with the 
guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. We should strengthen 
unity in all fields and mobilize the initiative of all fields to 
positively greet the critical year of 1994 and to create a new 
situation in the socialist market economic system. 
  In his speech, Wu Liji pointed out: Persisting in the 
fundamental principle of grasping both economic construction and 
spiritual civilization to create long-term and stable social and 
political environment for reform, opening up, and modernization 
drive constitutes an important content of the theory of building 
the socialism with Chinese characteristics. Next year is 
critical to deepening reform. All localities should 
conscientiously implement the "decision" of the third plenary 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the guidelines of 
the eighth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional 
party committee. All localities should not only persist in 
development without the slightest degree of deviation, increase 
the dynamics of reform, and accelerate the pace of building the 
socialist market economic system, but also steadfastly put 
stability in an important position, implement the principle of 
"regarding stability as an overriding task," truly regard 
economic construction as the central task, and make reform, 
opening up, economic development, and social stability promote 
one another. Party and government leaders at all levels should 
actually shoulder the duty of safeguarding political stability, 
should conscientiously persist in the principle of taking a 
two-handed approach and being tough with both hands" not only in 
holding meetings and issuing documents but also in actions, and 
should pay attention to the work of safeguarding social and 
political stability in the course of paying attention to reform 
and development. 
  He said: In our Inner Mongolia, national unity constitutes 
the foundation of social stability. The unity of the party, the 
unity among all levels of leading bodies in particular, 
constitutes the guarantee for maintaining unity among all 
nationalities. We should firmly and unremittingly educate the 
cadres and the masses of all nationalities with the Marxist 
viewpoint on nationalities and with the party's policies towards 
nationalities. We should always hold high the banner of 
developing the economy and promoting national unity. In 
promoting the cause of national unity and progress, we should 
correctly approach and handle the issue of nationalities in line 
with state laws and pertinent policies. 
  He stressed: Under the new situation, the most fundamental 
and effective way to make judicial, procuratorial, and state 
security organs persist in the party's basic line and facilitate 
economic construction, is to fully exploit the function of the 
people's democratic dictatorship entrusted on these organs by 
the state in order to create a good and stable social 
environment for accelerating economic development and 
establishing new systems. We should effectively exploit the 
functions of state security organs, actually strengthen the 
struggle against covered fronts, and frustrate subversion, 
infiltration, and sabotage of the hostile forces outside the 
territory. We should further organize cadres and the masses in 
the region to study and propagate the "state security law" to 
enhance their patriotic spirit and their sense of state 
security. At the same time, we should continue to deal severe 
blows to criminal cases, concentrate on investigating and 
handling major and appalling economic cases, such as corruption 
and embezzlement cases, punish serious criminal cases as 
severely and promptly as possible, and actually overcome and 
correct the phenomena of failing to enforce laws strictly and 
failing to deal severe blows to crimes. We should strengthen 
supervision over law enforcement of judicial, procuratorial, and 
state security organs in order to successful build these organs 
and successfully build the ranks of judicial, procuratorial, and 
security workers. 
  He also set forth specific demands on further strengthening 
leadership over judicial and state security work, on trying the 
best to solve conspicuous problems and difficulties, and in 
strengthening state security work. 
  A responsible person of the regional security department 
relayed the guidelines of the national security work conference. 
Attending the conference were the comrades who were attending 
the eighth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional 
party committee, responsible persons of the regional judicial 
and state security departments, and responsible comrades of 
judicial and procuratorial, public security, and security 
departments of various leagues and cities.

  [Text] The regional conference on the work of league and 
city chief procurators opened this morning. In his speech given 
at the opening of the conference, Zhang Hesong, chief procurator 
of the autonomous regional people's procuratorate, pointed out: 
The major tasks of the region's procuratorial work for this 
year are to strengthen the function of legal supervision; to 
strictly enforce laws; to give great attention to handling of 
cases; to concentrate efforts on investigating and handling 
major and serious cases, especially the cases committed by 
leading cadres, law violation resulting from perfunctory law 
enforcement, and the cases committed by legal persons; to crack 
down on various criminal activities to protect the legal rights 
and interests of citizens; and to safeguard political and social 
stability. 
  In his speech, Zhang Hesong first reviewed and summarized 
the 
region's 1993 procuratorial work and spoke on his understanding 
of the past year's work. Zhang Hesong pointed out: This year 
is the crucial year for comprehensive implementation of the 
guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party 
Central Committee. In the new situation, important historical 
missions are entrusted to procuratorial work. Attaching 
importance to the interests of the party, the state, and the 
people, we should enhance our sense of missions and 
responsibilities, conscientiously perform the function of legal 
supervision entrusted by the Constitution, and fulfill all tasks 
in an outstanding way. We should continue concentrating efforts 
on investigating and handling major and serious cases to 
maintain the sustained, in-depth, and healthy developmental 
trend in the anticorruption struggle. We should further 
intensify the work of investigation, reinforce and improve the 
work to report crimes, and strengthen judicial work. We should 
strengthen our coordination with discipline inspection, 
supervision, public security, state security, and court 
departments and provide information to and support each other. 
Procuratorial organs across the region must fully perform their 
functions as the tools of the people's democratic dictatorship 
and continue strict and prompt crackdown on serious criminal 
offenses according to law, with the focus on violent and gang 
crimes on murder, robbery, rape, violence, and robbery with a 
weapon. They should continue to participate in the unified 
action to crack major cases, deal blows to criminal rings, and 
pursue escaped criminals; the special struggles to eliminate 
theft, bus and train marauding and waylaying, abduction and 
trafficking of women and children, corruption, pornography, and 
six vices; and particular public security improvement activities 
in the localities and road sections where public security is 
chaotic and problems are many, thus combining special efforts in 
crackdown on crimes with the efforts to tackle chaos. We should 
continue strengthening supervision over law enforcement and 
resolutely correct perfunctory law enforcement to ensure unified 
and correct enforcement of state laws. We should have the 
courage to exercise supervision, emphasize work methods, focus 
on areas where supervision should be strengthened, and, by 
handling cases, continuously strengthen and improve supervision 
over law enforcement and raise the legal supervision level. 
  In his speech, Zhang Hesong also gave opinions on stepping 
up 
efforts to improve the contingents to upgrade their overall 
quality and enhance their combat strength.

<F P=106> [By reporter Gao Ping (7559 1627): "The Regional United </F>
Front Work Conference Is Held in Hohhot"] 
  [Text] On 28 December, the regional united front work 
conference was held in Hohhot. The conference called on the 
people of various nationalities and all circles across the 
region to work with one heart and one mind, to pool the efforts 
of all and to strive to realize our region's two expected goals 
by the end of this century and to realize the grand objective of 
"marching towards the front rank." 
  The conference was presided over by Wang Qun. Qian Fenyong 
gave an important speech. Bai Enpei, Wang Zhao, Geriletu and 
Wuyunwimuge attended the conference. 
  In his speech, Qian Fenyong first relayed the guidelines of 
the national united front work conference. He said: The 
national united front work conference was held at the time when 
our country's reform, opening up and modernization have entered 
a new historical stage. The conference used Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as a guidance, conscientiously studied and 
clearly defined the new situation and new tasks facing the 
current united front work. Qian Fenyong said: Inner Mongolia is 
a border minority area and the first region of our country where 
the regional national autonomy is implemented. The 
characteristics of having minority nationalities to live in 
compact communities and various religions have enabled our 
regional united front work to occupy an important position and 
to play an important role. To accelerate the pace of reform, 
opening up and economic development, Inner Mongolia must 
mobilize the strength of all sectors to participate in reform 
and construction and safeguard national unity, the reunification 
of the motherland and stability in the border areas. Along with 
the establishment of the socialist market economic system, the 
new pattern of establishing a structure of ownership with 
socialist public ownership as the main body and the joint 
development of multiple economic sectors is taking shape in our 
region and the rank of workers of the non-public sector is being 
expanded unceasingly. Under such circumstances, our region's 
united front has become greater in scope with more objects and 
heavy tasks. Party committees and governments at all levels, in 
particular, the party's leading cadres at all levels, should 
fully understand the important significance of our region's 
united front work from the strategic perspective of promoting 
the building of two civilizations, democracy and the legal 
system, safeguarding stability in the border areas and realizing 
a long period of order and stability, adopt practical and 
effective measures, strive to form a new atmosphere in our 
region's united front work and create a new situation. 
  Qian Fenyong said: To comprehensively promote our region's 
united front work, we must particularly grasp well four current 
tasks. First, we should conscientiously do nationalities work 
well. To successfully carry out nationalities work, the most 
crucial and core issue is to accelerate our region's economic 
development. At present, we should conscientiously implement 
the guidelines of the eighth enlarged plenary session of the 
fifth regional party committee under the guidance of the spirit 
of the decision of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC 
central Committee, regard the establishment of the socialist 
market economic system as the objective and carry out our work 
in close connection with the main theme of reform, opening up 
and development. We should continue to consolidate and develop 
a socialist national relation of equality, mutual help, unity 
and cooperation among the people of various nationalities and 
strengthen the great unity among people of various 
nationalities; second, we should strengthen management over 
religious affairs in line with law. We should comprehensively 
and correctly implement the party's policy on reform of 
religious beliefs, consolidate and develop the patriotic united 
front between the party and the religious circles and 
concentrate the will and strength of all religious believers on 
the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Meanwhile, we should ban and deal strict blows to illegal and 
law-breaking activities in line with law and channel religious 
activities to the path of policies and law; third, we should 
further strengthen the democratic party work. It is necessary 
to continuously uphold and improve the system of multi-party 
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of 
the CPC and give full play to the role of democratic parties and 
nonparty personages in joining the discussion of political 
affairs and democratic supervision. Party committees, people's 
congresses, governments, and the committees of Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference at all levels should 
realistically issue specific policies in an effort to 
institutionalize, standardize and regularize political 
consultation and democratic supervision. Party committees at all 
levels should strengthen the selection and training of nonparty 
cadres and unceasingly improve their quality; fourth, we should 
do a better job in united front work in various spheres and 
boost the enthusiasm of all sectors. It is necessary to further 
strengthen the work on intellectuals outside the party, unite 
with and mobilize the nonparty intellectuals to actively offer 
plans and measures and give full play to the role of the united 
front as a "tank of personnel." We should strengthen overseas 
united front work, give play to the role of overseas friendship 
associations, make friends extensively, and attract more 
compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and Overseas 
Chinese compatriots to come to our region on tour and 
observation and for making investments and engaging in economic 
and trade activities. 
  Wang Qun gave a speech at the end of the conference. He 
pointed out: The united front is an important magic weapon for 
our country to win a victory in revolution and construction. 
During the new historical period, the united front has a more 
extensive and profound historical significance. Party and 
government departments at all levels across the region, in 
particular, the principal leaders, should fully understand the 
important meaning of our region's united front work and 
conscientiously study and deeply understand the spirit of the 
national and regional united front work conferences. In 
implementing the party's united front policy, the task of prime 
importance is to grasp nationalities work. We should continue to 
consolidate and develop socialist national relations; uphold and 
improve the regional national autonomy system; and strive to 
accelerate economic development and social progress in minority 
areas. Wang Qun stressed: We should unite with all the forces 
that can be united, mobilize and educate people of various 
nationalities and various circles across the region to work with 
one heart and one mind, pool the efforts of all to overcome 
difficulties, and struggle to win a comprehensive victory of 
reform, opening up, development, unity and progress in our 
region.

  [Text] Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, inspected the work of Tianjin international airport 
yesterday morning. On behalf of the municipal party committee 
and the municipal government, he extended cordial regards to 
airport cadres, staff, and workers, and greetings and thanks to 
the broad masses of workers of the communications outlets and 
departments as well as units serving as a showcase for 
foreigners, who kept to production and to their work posts 
during the festive period. He stressed: During this year, to 
accelerate development, Tianjin must further expand opening up 
internationally and externally, welcome guests and friends from 
all directions and all over the world, and use foreign capital 
on a greater scale. Therefore, we must exert strenuous efforts 
to improve the municipal investment environment. All units 
across the municipality should devote efforts to improving the 
investment environment, and all people should do credit and 
contribute to fostering a good image of Tianjin in opening to 
the outside world. 
  Gao Dezhan and his entourage inspected the airport waiting 
hall and the cargo transport center, visited the on-duty 
personnel in the fields of security inspection, commercial 
service, customs, border inspection and fire prevention, and 
held cordial talks with them. While holding talks with 
responsible comrades of the Tianjin Civil Aviation Bureau, the 
Tianjin Branch of Air China and relevant departments at the 
airport, Gao Dezhan said: Beijing a showcase of Tianjin in 
opening to the outside world, Tianjin International Airport has 
achieved great achievements over the past few years and made 
positive contributions to Tianjin's economic development. The 
airport has good conditions in various aspects, with strong 
technological strength and great development potential. During 
this year, we should develop new ideas, take big move, work 
with one heart and one mind to seek greater achievements, and 
make new contributions to Tianjin's economic development. The 
municipal party committee and the municipal government have 
pinned great hopes on you. 
  Gao Dezhan said: This year, if Tianjin wants to seize the 
opportunity, accelerate the pace of reform, opening up, and 
modernization, and realize big development, the most fundamental 
things it should do is to further expand the degree of opening 
up, develop comprehensively towards all directions and in high 
layers and wider spheres, and regard using foreign capital on a 
broader scale as a prominent task. In this connection, we must 
further improve Tianjin's investment environment, enhance its 
attraction, and induce more people, materials and investments to 
flow to Tianjin. Improving investment environment is a 
comprehensive project involving the whole society, which can be 
achieved only by relying on the common efforts of all sectors. 
The airport, seaports, communication outlets, guesthouses, 
restaurants, emporiums and all "showcase" units should proceed 
from the reality, do our work well, and make more contributions 
to improving Tianjin's investment environment with a high sense 
of responsibility. All relevant departments should do a good 
job in holding talks on items concerning the use of more foreign 
capital; all management departments should render good service; 
all "showcase" units should create first-grade work, and at the 
same time, further strengthen the building of infrastructure 
facilities. We should build Tianjin into a city with beautiful 
environment, good order and quality service and one of the 
places with the best investment environment in the country 
through our common efforts. It is the duty of all people to 
improve the investment environment. The broad masses of people 
across the municipality should take action actively, and add 
credit to displaying the mental attitude of Tianjin people and 
cultivating a good image of Tianjin. 
  Gao Dezhan said: The more we accelerate development and 
deepen reform, the more we should mobilize the enthusiasm of the 
broad masses of people. Leading cadres at all levels should 
show greater concern for the living of the masses, try their 
best to seek benefits for them, care for their well-being, and 
do practical things for them. It is necessary to unceasingly 
increase the income of workers and enhance the level of living 
of retired people through developing production and raising 
efficiency. The Spring Festival will come soon. Leading cadres 
at all levels should go deeply to the masses, realistically make 
good arrangements for the living of the masses, pay special 
attention to helping workers and staff members with difficulties 
to solve practical problems, and conduct activities on caring 
for the well-being of the people in a down-to- earth manner. 
  Zheng Zhiying, member of the standing committee of the 
municipal party committee and secretary general, and responsible 
comrades of relevant departments participated in the inspection 
and visiting activities.

  [Text] Tianjin, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Foreign investments 
are coming in surges to this largest port city of north China in 
the opening days of the new year, usually a slack season for 
business activities. 
  Since the beginning of 1994, more than 150 business people 
from Hong Kong, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Italy, Malaysia 
and Taiwan have come to Tianjin for business inspections and 
trade talks. 
  Ninety-five contracts were signed in the first ten days of 
January, involving a negotiated investment volume of up to 168 
million U.S. dollars in the aggregate. Meanwhile, billions of 
yuan worth of agreements and letters of intent have been reached 
between the city and overseas companies. Both contracts and 
funds involved are equal to those for the whole year of 1991. 
  Mayor of the municipality Zhang Lichang described the inflow 
of overseas funds as a result of the city's bold reform measures 
designated for a market economy. 
  He said his city is attractive to overseas investors because 
of its ideal geographical location, advanced transportation, 
rich natural resources, high-grade technologies, and 
well-trained personnel. 
  Following the northward movement of foreign investments 
coming to China, the mayor said, Tianjin has become a new 
favorite for investors across the world. 
  General manager of the Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation 
Kawamura Hiroshi, regretful for his company's belated arrival to 
invest in Tianjin, said he was convinced that much of China's 
development potential lies in the north, with Tianjin the most 
hopeful contender to lead the northern economic take-off. 
  While facing competition from other provinces in the drive 
for overseas funds, Tianjin's success, starting from the sound 
foundation laid down over the past few years, will hinge on the 
established policies of accelerating development through more 
foreign investments, the mayor said. 
  As part of the efforts to expand business overseas, Mayor 
Zhang led a trade delegation to the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, 
and Hong Kong. During the tour, he had talks with chiefs of 
more than 40 financial groups about conducting business 
cooperations. 
  As a result, agreements were reached on more than 20 
cooperative projects, which involved more than four billion yuan 
in overseas investments. 
  Thanks to these efforts, Tianjin has become better known 
worldwide, which in turn benefits the city economically. 
  According to a recent meeting on foreign trade and economic 
relations, the city's target for 1994 is five billion U.S. 
dollars of contracted overseas investment. 
  Meeting participants were told that the bulk of the funds 
will go to the construction of infrastructures, capital 
industrial projects, the upgrading and renovation of old 
enterprises, the development of real estate, and the service 
industry. 
  As mapped out in the city's development strategy, Tianjin 
will complete the renovation of more than seven million old and 
unsafe houses within seven years. And eight years is the 
maximum period in which to finish upgrading of old enterprises. 
  The city also envisages setting up a new development zone in 
its coastal areas along the Bohai Sea.

  [Text] Tianjin, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin 
municipality, one of the biggest industrial cities in north 
China, will restructure all of its state-owned firms in the 
following eight years. 
  The plan was drawn up at a recent annual municipal economic 
work conference for 1994. 
  Zhang Lichang, mayor of the municipality, pointed out at the 
conference that state-owned firms could only become more 
competitive in both international and domestic markets after 
being restructured. 
  According to sources from the conference, most of the 
well-run large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in the 
city will be transformed into companies with limited liability 
or limited liability stock companies. 
  Meanwhile, systems of shareholding, joint stock, contracting 
and leasing will be expanded in small-sized enterprises. 
  Zhang is also encouraging well-run firms to form groups by 
means of merging and integration and said that in place of the 
single- product and single-sector operation, a diversified 
economy should be adopted and spread in state-owned enterprises, 
especially loss- making ones. 
  According to official statistics, there are now nearly 600 
large and medium-sized enterprises in Tianjin, which involve the 
industries of textiles, machinery, automobiles, metallurgy, 
electronics and automobiles.

<F P=106> [By Gilles Campion] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, Jan 20 (AFP)--The International Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Thursday [20 January] it had 
completed a first round of "positive" talks with the Chinese 
Government on making possible visits to political prisoners. 
  A four-member Red Cross delegation, led by the general 
delegate for Asia and the Pacific, Jean-Michel Monod, held 
meetings with officials from the foreign affairs and justice 
ministries from Sunday to Thursday. 
  "This first structured meeting should allow us to go farther 
with the talks," Monod told AFP, adding: "The contact in itself 
was positive, and it's a good first step. We have begun to 
identify the points where we agree and where we differ." 
  The talks come as Washington hikes pressure on China for 
progress on human rights, raised by U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen during his visit to Beijing, observers said. 
  Monod refused to link his negotiations to the dispute 
between 
Beijing and President Bill Clinton, who has threatened to scrap 
the lucrative "most-favoured-nation" customs access for Chinese 
imports if China fails to improve its record on human rights. 
  "It is unlikely that an agreement between the Chinese 
government and the ICRC would be signed before June," Monod 
added. "To negotiate such a document is a long-term job, and 
the talks could go on for several years if there is no consensus 
within the government." 
  In November, just before the summit meeting between Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin and Clinton in Seattle, Chinese Foreign 
Affairs Minister Qian Qichen said: "If the Red Cross asks to 
have such talks (on the visit to Chinese prisons), we will 
consider this request in a positive manner." 
  Another contact was made in November, at the ICRC's 
headquarters in Geneva, to focus on the details of the first 
round of talks. 
  "The Chinese asked good questions during this meeting (in 
Beijing) and in view of the quality of these questions, there 
is an interest in learning," Monod said. The negotiations, he 
said, would take "at least several months...we have no interest 
in pushing them. The decision will come when they have all the 
necessary facts." The ICRC has been asking unsuccessfully "at 
least since 1985" to visit Chinese prisons, Monod said. 
  "We have decided to completely explain the ICRC's work in 
order to avoid a lack of understanding and disagreements," Monod 
said. "It's necessary that we begin to agree on the type of 
detainees of we are talking about. These are not common 
criminals, but individuals detained because of their activities 
or events," he said. "We are going to see what the difficulties 
are for the Chinese, and we will consult our experts to try to 
iron out these difficulties," he said, adding that a second 
meeting would be set up "in a few weeks," in Geneva or Beijing. 
  The delegation, which left Beijing Thursday, included Angelo 
Graedinger, chief of the Geneva-based ICRC's prison division, 
Christophe Swinarski, regional delegate for East Asia and Daniel 
Glinz, delegate for East Asia. 
  The ICRC is concerned with humanitarian needs, not human 
rights, and holds to a rule of confidentiality, which prohibits 
it from publishing its reports and allows the organization to 
mention the reports only to the authorities of the visited 
country. Analysts said that the confidentiality probably 
appeals to the Chinese government. Organizations which defend 
human rights in China, of which there are many financed by the 
United States, irritate Beijing with their publicized actions. 
According to the Chinese ministry of justice, China has 1.2 
million prisoners, of whom 3,600 are described as 
"counter-revolutionaries."

  [Text] Bonn, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Both top Chinese and 
German parliamentary leaders tonight agreed to furthering the 
existing good ties of the two parliaments. 
  Rita Suessmuth, president of Germany's Federal Assembly, 
gave 
a banquet here in honor of Qiao Shi, chairman of China's 
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, who is 
paying an official goodwill visit to Germany as Suessmuth's 
guest. 
  In her speech, Suessmuth praised China's policy of reform 
and 
opening up, and the highly speeded growth of economies in Asian 
countries including China as well as the improvement of people's 
living standard. 
  She said Germany and China should boost ties not only in 
economy, but also in culture, science and technology. 
  Qiao said the growth of friendly relations between the two 
nations demonstrates again that countries differing in social 
systems and ideologies are able to develop their long-term and 
stable relations and cooperation so long as they strictly abide 
by the principles of mutual respect, seeking common grounds 
while reserving differences, non-interference in each other's 
internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit 
  Qiao said since the Cold War and bipolar structure came to 
an 
end, some positive changes have taken place in international 
relations. But the world is far from tranquility and the world 
people are still facing the issues of peace and development. 
  He said China and Germany, as two important and influential 
countries in the world, are respectively at an important period 
of historical development. 
  Strengthening dialogues and expanding cooperation between 
the 
two countries will not only conform to the interests of the two 
peoples, but also benefit the world peace, stability and 
development, he said. 
  "I am deeply convinced that there exists a grand prospect 
for 
the development of Sino-German relations which are facing toward 
the 21st century," Qiao added.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 20 (CNA) -- The upcoming high-level 
meeting between the two intermediary organizations on both sides 
of the Taiwan Strait aims to forge mutual trust and promote 
bilateral cooperation, chairman Huang Kun-hui of the Mainland 
Affairs Council said Thursday [20 January]. 
  "We hope the meeting between the deputy heads of Taipei's 
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) scheduled to start 
late this month can find ways to resolve some practical issues 
arising from increasing bilateral contacts in recent years," 
Huang told the press prior to his departure for Manila to 
explain Taipei's policy toward Beijing to Philippine and 
overseas Chinese business leaders. 
  Huang also urged mainland authorities to face the reality 
that China is now divided and ruled by two different 
governments. "The two sides should respect each other and work 
together to pave the way for eventual national unification," he 
stressed. 
  SEF vice chairman and secretary-general Chiao Jen-ho will 
leave for Mainland China January 31 to meet with his ARATS 
counterpart Tang Shubei on how to strengthen cooperation between 
the two organizations and to resolve thorny cross-strait issues, 
such as repatriation of mainland hijackers and illegal 
immigrants, fishing disputes and protection of Taiwan investors. 
  This will be Chiao's first trip to the mainland since he 
assumed his current post late November. Chiao was previously a 
vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and a close 
aide to president Li Teng-hui. 
  The forthcoming Chiao-Tang meeting will be the first 
high-level contact between the two intermediary bodies since the 
ground- breaking talks between SEF chairman C.F. Ku and ARATS 
president Wang Daohan in Singapore last April. 
  The cabinet-level MAC originally planned to postpone the 
Chiao- Tang talks to protest Beijing's recent unfriendly moves, 
including forcing France to stop arms sales and Lesotho to sever 
diplomatic ties with Taiwan. 
  The council, however, announced late Wednesday that it 
finally decided to allow Chiao to visit the mainland as 
scheduled with a view to promoting constructive interaction 
between the two sides. 
  Chiao will be accompanied by several other SEF officials, 
including deputy secretaries-general Shih Chi-ping and Hsu 
Hui-you, legal service department director Lin Kui-mei and 
economic affairs department director Chang Chung-lin, on his 
mainland visit. 
  SEF and ARATS officials held three rounds of working-level 
talks in the second half of last year, including one in Taipei, 
but failed to reach any agreements mainly because of Beijing's 
reluctance to recognize Taipei's jurisdiction over territories 
now under its control. 
  SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations founded by 
their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in 
the absence of official contacts.

  [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- As part of the 
country's new year's resolution, the auditing administration at 
all levels will expend more effort this year in checking and 
supervising state financial revenue and expenditure, taxation 
and banking systems, as well as operation of state-owned assets. 
  Lu Peijian, auditor-general of the State Auditing 
Administration, said here today at a national auditing 
conference that one of the main tasks of this year's work is to 
check for the existence of illegal transmissions of capital 
funds in financial departments. 
  He explained that from this year on, about one-third of the 
major state projects currently under construction will have to 
be audited every year. Those already completed will certainly 
be included. 
  The auditing administrations will mainly check whether 
investment in these projects has been directly and rationally 
applied to its designated uses. 
  So far as overseas-funded construction projects are 
concerned, Lu said, standard audit reports will be submitted to 
overseas investors, so as to be in line with international 
practice. 
  China has yielded good results in auditing during the last 
ten years since it set up formal auditing administrations. 
  In the period, over 22.8 billion yuan which should have been 
raised for state financial departments but had been pocketed 
illegally has been uncovered by auditing administrations. 
  As a result, they have helped cut down state expenses by 
more 
than 40 billion yuan.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 22 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
Treasury Lloyd Bentsen and his party concluded their four-day 
China trip and left here by air this afternoon. 
  Before his departure, Bentsen said that China is a country 
which has the fastest growing economy in Asia and its prosperity 
and stability will benefit both the U.S. and the world as a 
whole. 
  The U.S. visitors this morning made a tour of a local diesel 
engine company, which has bought a total of eight million U.S. 
dollars of U.S. equipment over the last decade. During the 
tour, Bentsen expressed the hope that the American and Chinese 
entrepreneurs would strengthen their cooperation. 
  At noon, Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju met with Bentsen and his 
party and gave a banquet in their honor. 
  Bentsen arrived in Beijing Wednesday at the invitation of 
his 
Chinese counterpart Liu Zhongli. 
  The U.S. secretary arrived in Shanghai yesterday, after 
attending the reactivated Eighth Session of the Sino-U.S. Joint 
Economic Committee in Beijing.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Firmly Supports China's </F>
Return to GATT"] 
  [Text] U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen's China 
visit has made inspiring achievements and vigorously promoted 
bilateral trade and economic cooperation. With the issuance of 
a joint statement by the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee 
yesterday, a new framework for closer trade and economic 
contacts between the two countries was set up. This was a 
successful attempt to handle matters concerning the economic 
interests of both countries in the spirit of "seeking common 
ground while reserving differences." 
  The joint statement pointed out: The financial ministers of 
both countries agree that the Sino-U.S. Joint Economic Committee 
will meet every year in the two countries by rotation. Meetings 
of the committee have been suspended for seven years. Now with 
the establishment of a new cooperative mechanism under which the 
committee will meet once a year, cooperation between the two 
countries in the industrial, agricultural, scientific and 
technological, financial, and trade fields will surely be 
vigorously promoted. China is now going all out to promote 
market-oriented economic reform and trying to dovetail its 
economy into the world economy. This is not only a good thing 
for China but also a good thing for the world. The United 
States clearly expressed its stand of "firmly supporting China 
to restore its position as a signatory state to GATT." 
  If China's position as a signatory state to GATT is 
restored, 
all countries will be able to open up commodity, financial, and 
service markets in China, and Western countries, which are 
striving hard for economic prosperity, will be greatly 
benefited. That is why the United States is firmly supporting 
restoration of China's position as a signatory state to GATT. 
More than that, Lloyd Bentsen gave the following message to 
China on behalf of President Clinton: "The United States 
supports a stable, prosperous, and modernized China." The United 
States has not only spoken favorably of China's policy decisions 
on reform of its monetary and financial, tax, and foreign 
exchange systems, but also expressed willingness to provide 
technological aid for these reforms. To help China carry out 
reform of its monetary system, the United States is willing to 
provide China with professional knowledge and practical 
experience. For this reason, Chairman Greenspan of the U.S. 
Federal Reserve Board will also visit China later this year. 
The United States always carries out macroeconomic regulation 
and control, regulates the exchange rates of the dollar, and 
readjusts relations between the issuance of banknotes and its 
internal and external economic and trade activities by means of 
the interest rate and other means such as issuing bonds and 
bills and directly interfering in the exchange market. 
Undoubtedly, these are all experiences for China to study. 
  Of course, the United States has its own interests. The more 
mature China's market system is, the more opportunities there 
will be for U.S. investment in China. Moreover, establishment 
of close, friendly, and cooperative relations with China is also 
good for the United States in opening up and occupying the 
Chinese market. That is why the chairman of the U.S. Federal 
Reserve Board will follow the treasury secretary and come to 
visit China. Apart from cabinet members, some sub-cabinet work 
groups will also be engaged in handling three major items, 
namely, "currency and banks," exchange rates, and investment and 
economic cooperation. The three subministerial work groups will 
meet once every six months. Between the meetings, there will be 
some special technological officials to take charge of 
coordination matters and provide aid so that the work groups can 
make achievements as soon as possible. 
  The third item, "investment and economic cooperation," is 
particularly eye-catching. In the next five years, China will 
import $700 billion worth of equipment. All countries are vying 
with one another for these contracts, which will be carried over 
to the next century. By establishing a work-group-level 
permanent channel and promoting economic cooperation with China, 
the United States has taken an early step into the Chinese 
market and gained an advantage of being in a favored position. 
Following the United States, there will be another "China 
craze" in the Western countries. Japan and west European 
countries will come one after another to take "China--an 
economic express train." This is because if one does not get a 
seat at the crucial moment and lets the market be occupied by 
others, one will find it very difficult to enter the market in 
the future and will always be at a disadvantage in competition. 
  Trade between China and the United States is still being 
obstructed by some outdated laws. The United States should 
relax restrictions on exports of certain scientific and 
technological products to China and on China trade. The dispute 
over China's MFN status every year also seriously hinders 
development of Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations. 
Therefore, at a press conference, Lloyd Bentsen pointed out 
that China and the United States should first resolve the MFN 
issue. This is a change in policy for looking ahead. Provided 
China and the United States observe guidelines of the communique 
on establishing diplomatic relations and do not interfere in 
each other's internal affairs, all issues can be resolved 
through consultations. China is now adopting an open and 
pragmatic attitude. It is hoped that the U.S. side will also do 
more solid work and break away from quibbling over certain 
issues to vigorously make a new step forward.

the joint economic committee after a suspension of six years. 
  The two events mark a major step toward a new stage of trade 
and economic cooperation between the two countries, observers 
here said. 
  Despite frequent frictions in Sino-U.S. trade and economic 
ties, their cooperation in the field has been developing at a 
encouraging pace in recent years. 
  China's customs statistics show that the trade volume 
between 
the two countries reached 27.65 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, 
registering an increase of more than 10 billion U.S. dollars 
over the previous year. 
  Last year, both countries saw a great increase in their 
exports to each other. The U.S. export of machinery and 
electronic products, airplanes, and complete sets of equipment 
to China rose more rapidly. 
  The United States has maintained its status of China's third 
largest trade partner and China has also become a major trade 
partner of the United States. 
  China is the purchaser of one fifth of the U.S. total export 
of wheat and one sixth of its exported phosphate fertilizer. 
  Besides, as a major buyer of the U.S. airplanes, China has 
bought more than 200 Boeing airplanes with a total value of over 
10 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Meanwhile, China has approved about 8,000 U.S.-funded 
projects with a total contractual investment of 10.8 billion 
U.S. dollars, and the United States has become one of the 
largest foreign investors in China. 
  An outstanding feature for last year's U.S. investment in 
China is that more and more transnational corporations have 
showed great enthusiasm in investing in China. Up to now, many 
of the 500 U.S. leading firms have launched large-sized joint 
ventures with China. 
  The Clinton administration has made the revitalization of 
the 
economy and the enhancement of the competitiveness of the U.S. 
products as one of its major tasks, while China, with a 
sustained high-growth of economy, is formulating and 
implementing its overall economic development program. 
  Therefore, trade between China and the U.S. are strongly 
complementary in many ways and the two may enjoy each other's 
huge potential markets, thus increasing the competitiveness of 
their products through cooperation. 
  Moreover, China imports a large number of products from the 
U.S. every year, such as wheat, aircraft, fertilizer, paper, 
machines and electronics. 
  With the development of China's national economy, the demand 
of its domestic market will be further enhanced. Its targeted 
import volume between 1991-1995 is estimated to be more than 400 
billion U.S. dollars, which involves the construction of 
airports, power stations, energy and telecommunication projects. 
And the power station projects only will cost over 10 billion 
U.S. dollars, which will surely intrigue foreign enterprises, 
including the U.S. ones. 
  Despite of the sound grounds for the further development of 
the Sino-U.S. trade and economic ties, the annual discussion on 
China's most favored nation (MFN) status in the U.S. has been 
casting a shadow on them. Chinese trade officials said that a 
smooth development of bilateral trade and economic ties needs a 
permanent solution of the MFN issue. 
  Trade deficit is another factor that has affected bilateral 
trade relations. The reason lies in different methods of 
statistics and some U.S. export limitations to China. 
  According to sources, China and the U.S. have agreed to set 
up a working group to solve the difference in counting between 
the two sides. 
  People here believed that if the U.S. rescinds its 
limitations in export to China, China's import from the U.S. 
will surely see a remarkable increase. 
  They said that as long as the foresighted politicians and 
entrepreneurs of both sides can grasp the opportunity, face the 
challenge together and continue their fruitful cooperation, the 
spring of a new era for the Sino-U.S. trade and economic 
relations will come soon.

<F P=106> [From the "Beijing political situation" column by Jen </F>
Hui-wen (0117 1979 2429): "China Appreciates Sino-U.S. 
Relations in the Nixon Era"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (HSIN PAO) -- China and the United 
States hold the balance in international affairs, hence 
Sino-U.S. relations are always the focus of the world. 
Sino-U.S. relations were at a low ebb after the 4 June Incident 
in Beijing. In November 1993, PRC President Jiang Zemin met 
U.S. President Clinton in Seattle at the latter's invitation. 
Since this was the first official meeting between the heads of 
state of the two countries in more than four years due to a 
break in high-level dialogues, it was considered a new beginning 
in the improvement of Sino-U.S. relations. However, to 
everyone's surprise, and at a time when a thawing of Sino-U.S. 
relations was expected, the United States unilaterally announced 
on 6 January that China's textile import quotas would be reduced 
by 25 to 35 percent starting 17 January. Although China has 
already agreed to settle this issue through talks by 17 January, 
it was, after all, the United States which stirred up the 
Sino-U.S. trade war. In viewed of this, people cannot but ask: 
How will Sino-U.S. relations develop? In order to answer this 
question, we must first understand how the Clinton 
administration has revised its policy towards China and how the 
Chinese Government is reacting to the United States. 
<H5>  Clinton Revises His Tactics Towards China </H5>
  According to a source in Beijing, after studying U.S. 
foreign 
policies since Clinton came to power, Chinese experts in U.S. 
affairs judged that the United States had decided to revise its 
policy towards China before Clinton invited Jiang Zemin to 
Seattle. The United States did not give up its strategy of 
facilitating changes in China through peaceful evolution, but 
due to the consideration of revitalizing the domestic economy 
(the United States has elevated economic issues to the high 
plane of national security), it decided to change its tactics 
towards China and establish multilateral relations through 
dialogue with various Chinese ministries. On 7 September 1993, 
the Clinton administration pointed out in the "Evaluation Report 
on U.S. Policies Towards China in Recent Years," of which the 
Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of 
Representatives were informed by memorandum (the report was 
passed later): It is necessary to treat U.S. national 
interests, rather than human rights in China, as a top priority. 
It showed that Clinton wanted to change the past practice of 
dealing with foreign relations which treated human rights in 
China as the top priority and which neglected economic issues 
related to U.S. national interests and national security. 
  U.S. political circles described the revised policy towards 
China as a "policy of contacts," which implies: On the one 
hand, with the Clinton-Jiang Summit as the beginning, the United 
States will have more and more contacts with China. In 
particular, the two "forbidden zones" of mutual visits between 
senior leaders and of military contacts set up by the United 
States have been abolished, thus implying that the atmosphere of 
Sino-U.S. relations will be improved. On the other hand, if the 
United States mainly resorted to the practice of "facilitating 
changes by exerting pressure" on China in the past several 
years, it will, more often than not in the future, try to 
influence China and ask China to change its existing systems and 
policies through contacts and cooperation. 
  However, Chinese experts in U.S. affairs pointed out: It is 
true that the Clinton administration treats the reinvigoration 
of the domestic economy as the top priority and the 
consideration of economic interests has a greater share in its 
foreign policy, but U.S. diplomacy in the post-Cold War era 
still considers the pursuit of economic interests, defense of 
national security, and promotion of "democracy and human rights" 
as three interrelated and complementary goals. Compared with 
other powers, U.S. diplomacy has strong ideological colors. The 
House of Representatives sticks to the principle that human 
rights diplomacy can never be abolished, otherwise the United 
States will lose its spiritual leadership in the world and 
friction will arise in economic cooperation. Hence, although a 
thawing of Sino-U.S. relations after the Seattle Summit is 
expected, substantive issues have not yet been resolved and 
China should make a sober estimate of the difficulties in 
Sino-U.S. relations. 
  The source said: Chinese experts on U.S. affairs and Chinese 
leaders hold that senior U.S. Government officials (for example, 
President Clinton and Secretary of State Christopher) are not as 
farsighted as former U.S. President Richard Nixon and former 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The unremitting efforts and 
courageous policy decisions made by Nixon and Kissinger for the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States 
and China are still a much-told tale. For this reason, they 
established friendship with China and become friends of the 
Chinese people. Not long ago, DACANKAO [LARGE REFERENCE 1129 
0639 5072], a CPC journal published internally for senior 
cadres' perusal, compared the three letters separately sent by 
Kissinger and James Lilley (former U.S. ambassador to China) to 
the U.S. presidents and its intention was obviously to praise 
Kissinger and censure Lilley, which shows that the Chinese 
authorities very much appreciate Sino-U.S. relations in the 
Nixon-Kissinger era. 
<H5>  Beijing Appreciates Nixon and Kissinger </H5>
  DACANKAO said: In order to normalize American-Chinese 
relations, Kissinger wrote two letters to President Nixon and 
one to President Reagan. He volunteered to pave the way for 
Nixon's visit to China and later helped bring about 
U.S.-Vietnamese peace talks. Consequently, he and Vietnam's Le 
Dec Tho were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Late PRC 
Premier Zhou Enlai said when congratulating him, "Dec Tho will 
get longevity and you will get valuables." The non-isolation 
policy pursued by Reagan was also facilitated by Kissinger. The 
Chinese people will never forget Kissinger's contributions to 
the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the 
United States. 
  DACANKAO went on to say: Lilley also wrote three letters to 
the U.S. president (Bush). His second letter, which is still 
sensible, suggested that it was inadvisable for the United 
States to link human rights with trade in formulating its policy 
towards China. However, his first letter (which was written 
after the disintegration of the Soviet Union) maintained that 
the United States should fully support Taiwan independence, and 
his third letter maintained that the United States should 
vigorously and unequivocally support Hong Kong Governor Patten's 
political reform package. Obviously, these two letters were 
antagonistic towards China. In particular, his advocacy of 
Taiwan independence helps China see clearly that there are two 
persons surnamed "Li" working for Taiwan independence, the first 
one is Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan and the other is James Lilley of 
the United States, which may be called a "two-man comic show, 
with one singing while the other acts." It is impudent enough 
for people like Lilley to try to play Kissinger's role in the 
present time, but are they qualified? 
  Chinese experts in U.S. affairs said: By praising Kissinger 
and censuring Lilley, DACANKAO hoped that in dealing with 
Sino-U.S. relations, the Clinton administration can, just as 
Nixon and Kissinger did, bear its own long-term strategic 
interests in mind and, at the same time, respect China's 
interests according to the principles of mutual respect and 
equality without haggling over differences in social systems and 
ideologies, thus properly resolving the issues between China and 
the United States. 
  The source also said: The Chinese Government is fully aware 
that Clinton has revised his policy towards China and is willing 
to have dialogue with China, but so far he has not had the same 
strategic courage as Nixon and Kissinger had. He will still 
couple threats with promises and frequently stir up troubles in 
the process of making contacts with China. Moreover, China 
cannot but notice that recently the Clinton administration aims 
at China and has taken some abnormal moves on the issues of the 
DPRK, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. 
<H3>  China Pays Attention to Abnormal Moves Taken by the United 
States </H3>
  As far as the DPRK issue is concerned, the United States 
once 
held that with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, China's 
strategic position declined. But with the emergence of the DPRK 
nuclear issue, the United States affirms the importance of 
China's strategic position and wants to win over China to 
jointly deal with DPRK. 
  As far as the Vietnam issue is concerned, the United States 
wants to win over Vietnam so as to make it become another China 
in the Cold War period, whereas China is regarded as the 
then-Soviet Union. Hence, on the one hand, the United States 
announced the decision to relax the 18-year-long trade ban 
against Vietnam to reciprocate Vietnam's assistance to the 
United States in searching for MIA's from the Vietnam War, and 
on the other hand secret talks have been held in Paris and 
Vietnam, which will be elevated to the ambassadorial level or 
even the level of special envoy. Clinton described the U.S. 
envoy taking part in the talks as a modern Kissinger. 
  As far as the Hong Kong issue is concerned, members of the 
U.S. House of Representatives and the person in charge of the 
Republican Party's Human Rights Committee have already promised 
leaders of Hong Kong's radical democrats that they will put 
forward a motion at regular Congressional sessions in the near 
future: First, to amend the "Law of Hong Kong Relations" and 
ask the State Council to submit a report on Hong Kong issues to 
Congress once a year instead of twice a year; second, to urge 
Patten to table his original political reform package to the 
Hong Kong Legislative Council for discussion; and third, to ask 
Congress to open a hearing on the issue of democratization in 
Hong Kong. 
  As indicated by various signs, there is a thawing of 
Sino-U.S. relations, but the path is still not easy. As 
compelled by reality, the Chinese authorities must 
conscientiously study tactics to deal with the United States. 
Hence, the development of Sino-U.S. relations in the future 
will still be the special concern of the world.

  [Text] Beijing, January 17 (XINHUA) -- A seminar opened 
here today to discuss the access of Chinese enterprises to the 
capital market of the United States. 
  Some 150 Chinese and American securities experts, 
accountants 
and lawyers attended the one-day seminar, which was jointly 
sponsored by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the 
Bank of New York of the United States. 
  Fu Fengxiang, vice-chairman of the China Securities 
Regulatory Commission, said at the seminar that China's 
securities market has experienced fast development since the 
country started reform and opening 15 years ago. 
  He said that a good environment for securities business in 
China has taken shape. 
  Fu told the participants that China adopted nearly 20 laws 
and regulations concerning securities last year. And it is 
going to promulgate a securities law in the near future to 
provide better legal protection for the management of securities. 
  He noted that Sino-foreign cooperation in the economic field 
has expanded from joint ventures to capital investment. 
  China recently issued depository receipts in the United 
States which have shown positive results, Fu said. 
  Fu expressed his belief that the seminar will effectively 
encourage Chinese enterprises and their securities to enter the 
world market, especially the U.S. capital market. 
  Joseph M. Velli, executive vice-president of the Bank of New 
York, briefed the participants on the U.S. capital market, 
saying that according to an estimation of his bank, China will 
become the most important new depository receipts-issuing 
country. 
  He added that many international companies and individual 
buyers are "very interested" in China's stocks issued in the 
United States. 
  J. Carter Beese, commissioner of the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Edmund Lukas, vice-president of the New 
York Stock Exchange, and Thomas D. Sanford, vice-president of 
the Bank of New York, answered questions raised by participants.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 20 (XINHUA) -- There will be more 
exchanges between the capital markets of China and the United 
States, with the Shanghai-based Petrochemical Shareholding 
Company Ltd entering the U.S. capital market in the form of 
American Depositary Receipts (ADR). 
  U.S. investment in China will benefit both sides, J. Carter 
Beese, director of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 
said here yesterday at a symposium on how to enter the capital 
market of the United States. 
  The symposium was jointly sponsored by the Shanghai 
Municipal 
Government and the Bank of New York. 
  Carter Beese said that he was happy about China's plan to 
issue one billion U.S. dollars-worth of global bonds in the 
United States. It will be the first time for China to enter the 
capital market of the United States. 
  Shanghai Vice-Mayor Wu Kuangdi agreed to Carter Beese's 
view. 
  Now three Shanghai-based companies have entered the capital 
market of the United States in the ADR form. Xu thought that 
they would help establish a good image for Chinese enterprises 
in the United States. 
  Edmund Lukas, vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange, 
estimated that the trading volume of ADR in the United States 
will grow from 20 billion U.S. dollars last year to some 25 
billion U.S. dollars this year, which will probably involve new 
enterprises from China. 
  Joseph M. Velli, vice-president of the Bank of New York, 
also 
lectured at the symposium, telling some 200 Chinese stock 
exchange officials how to enter the capital market of the United 
States in the form of ADR.

conduct initial cooperation in automobile parts, building 
materials, electric power and expressways. 
  Vice-Mayor Lu Yucheng said that Beijing would try to attract 
more international companies and consortiums to invest in its 
basic construction, including automobiles, building materials 
and energy. 
  By the end of last year, Beijing had approved 7,512 foreign- 
funded enterprises, involving more than 10.24 billion U.S. 
dollars in foreign funds. More than 1,600 of the enterprises 
have started production and reported a sales volume of 20.5 
billion yuan last year. 
  There are now 1,129 U.S.-funded enterprises in Beijing, with 
a U.S. investment of more than 1.26 billion U.S. dollars, 
ranking second after Hong Kong.

  [Text] New York, January 14 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. giant 
medicine manufacturer Merck &amp; Co. has formulated a strategy 
for 
entering the Chinese market, with the help from Hong Kong. 
  Using Hong Kong as a base, the company is looking to sell 
many of its more than 150 prescription medicines in China, 
according to the Hong Kong Trade Development Council's New York 
office here today. 
  P. Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive office of Merck 
said, after a recent trip to China's Shenzhen, his company has 
made some important decisions about China and their strategy was 
well advanced and about to crystallize. 
  The visit by a five-member Merck delegation to Shenzhen was 
organized by the Hong Kong Council. Since 1953 Merck has 
established its Far East Regional Office in Hong Kong and in the 
past months representative offices were also set up in Beijing, 
Shanghai and Guangzhou. 
  As the chairman noted, the company has now reached the point 
to become a joint venture partner in selling directly to China's 
domestic market and producing some of the products on the 
mainland. 
  A technology transfer project from Merck prompted China's 
national vaccine and serum institute to launch a factory in 
Beijing last October that produced vaccine against hepatitis B 
and now a similar factory is now under construction in Shenzhen.

<F P=106> [Article by Xiao Yong (2556 0737): "U.S. Intelligence Work </F>
Focuses on Protecting Economic and Practical Interests"] 
  [Text] Following the end of the Cold War and the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, major changes have taken 
place in the global security strategy of the United States. In 
order to deal with the Soviet threat during the Cold War, the 
United States had to throw large amount of human and material 
resources into security and defense, of which the essential 
point was to collect intelligence related to the Soviet 
political, military, diplomatic, economic, scientific, and 
technological fields. Like the country's strategy as a whole, 
the CIA is undergoing a period of major readjustment. 
  However, it is no easy job to reform an intelligence system 
which has taken shape over the past 50 years. The question was 
raised as early as 1990, when David Boren, then chairman of the 
Senate's Intelligence Committee, proposed that the United States 
must have a new intelligence strategy to meet the changes in the 
world situation. In view of the relaxation in tense U.S.-Soviet 
ties, the Soviet Union had not yet disintegrated, and there were 
no indication of any relaxation of regional conflicts, Boren 
proposed that U.S. intelligence agencies must have the capacity 
to verify new and complicated agreements on arms control while 
continuously keeping watch on Soviet military deployments and 
the activities of the Soviet leadership. At the same time, 
Boren insisted on information supplied by human beings, 
infiltrating terrorist and drug organizations, and following 
trends in weapons proliferation; paying attention to economic 
information; and having comprehensive and early forecasts of 
"enemy" intentions. In a word, the shift in U.S. intelligence 
must start as quickly as possible. 
  From then on, there were numerous analyses and debates on 
intelligence reform in the United States. The basic orientation 
was to adapt to the post-Cold War changes; reduce surveillance 
of Soviet military activities; collect more economic 
information, strategic trade information, and trends in 
financial markets; and offer services which could help maintain 
global U.S. economic superiority. 
  After deliberations by relevant quarters for around two 
years, CIA Director Gates officially submitted to President Bush 
a plan for CIA reform in April 1992. The plan has yet to be 
made public. Viewed from information disclosed by various 
quarters, a number of readjustments were quietly made in U.S. 
intelligence work. 
  The readjustments were mainly changes in the focus of 
intelligence work. First, viewed from the angle of states, the 
United States still regarded the CIS as its "main" target for 
intelligence collection, particularly the political and economic 
situation in the CIS and the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. Second, collection of intelligence on arms 
proliferation, and international drugs and terrorist 
organizations in other countries. Moreover, the United States 
also attached great importance to international financial, 
trade, and technological information and paid close attention to 
intelligence on environmental protection, natural resources, and 
public health. 
  U.S. intelligence collection relies heavily on the economic 
field. To prepare the current reform plan, it is said that the 
White House asked more than 20 government departments to submit 
the foci of their intelligence work to the year 2005. The 
results indicated that around half of the reports were focused 
on economic areas. Most U.S. officials believe that by the end 
of the century, the most serious challenge to the country would 
come from the international economic field. After analyses, 
selection, and summaries of these reports, a new scheme proposed 
three major tasks for U.S. intelligence agencies to collect 
international economic information: First, keep abreast of 
global economic trends and opportunities, take note of their 
influence on a stable international situation which includes the 
economies of "allies" and "potential enemies," and track 
economic activities and unusual financial relations and 
commercial transactions. Second, track trends in international 
science and technology, particularly advanced technological 
trends, such as the development and application of 
supercomputers and the development of semiconductors and 
information technology, and judge the impact these developments 
could have on U.S. security. Third, strengthen economic 
monitoring work. In the intelligence sphere, the United States 
discovered that many countries, including its allies, had 
shifted the focus of their attention from politics to the 
economy, taken North America as their target, and had vigorously 
collected U.S. economic and commercial information. 
  According to the U.S. media, the CIA holds that the country 
must guard against more than 20 countries which are involved in 
gathering "industrial information" from U.S. companies. More 
attention was given to this matter after Clinton assumed office. 
At his approval by Congress earlier this year, CIA Director R. 
James Woolsey said that the gathering of economic information is 
"the hottest topic in current intelligence policy" and that the 
Clinton administration will carry out "comprehensive research" 
on the matter. In the coming year, the Clinton administration 
will adopt a series of measures to ensure the gathering of 
economic information and anti-espionage work. Statistics show 
that the proportion of spending on gathering information in the 
former Soviet Union dropped from 58 percent in the 1980's to 
under 20 percent, while spending on the economic and other 
fields continues to rise, amounting to two- thirds. By the end 
of 1993, Woolsey stressed that the CIA had already played an 
"essential role" in hitting at foreign intelligence agencies, 
which were trying to gather industrial information in U.S. 
companies through bribery. He also disclosed that the CIA's 
anti-espionage work saved the country billions of dollars in 
losses each year. 
  In order to adapt to the above changes, the U.S. 
administration also correspondingly readjusted its management 
and coordination of all kinds of intelligence work, as well as 
the intelligence analysis mechanism. For example, the Defense 
Department assigned special personnel to help exercise 
management over planning and budgets for the nation's 
intelligence agencies in order to eliminate malpractices by 
different departments in formulating variant policies for 
intelligence work and outlays during the Cold War. The 
administration also made the CIA's "National Intelligence 
Committee," which is responsible for evaluating information, 
independent, allowing it to merge the "Joint Intelligence 
Committee on Atomic Energy"; the "Intelligence Committee on 
Science and Technology"; and the "Intelligence Committee on 
Space Systems and Weapons"; attached importance to a series of 
existing special intelligence organs; and strengthened unified 
management. At the same time, the United States stressed the 
role of agents and changed the Cold War trend, which relied 
excessively on satellites, aerial reconnaissance, and other 
technical means. On one hand, some people say that this was a 
lesson learned from the Gulf war. Prior to Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait, the United States took satellite photographs of Iraq's 
military deployments. However, there was a lack of verification 
by agents on the ground and in sounding out Iraq's intentions. 
For this reason, the United States has emphasized the necessity 
of better training for its agents, particularly those proficient 
in the languages and cultures of Third World nations, who should 
appear more in the capacity of nongovernmental officials to 
reduce dependence on satellite information. On the other hand, 
as most regional and limited conflicts have taken place in Third 
World nations, and the United States has a shortage of relevant 
experts and agents, the United States has shifted its security 
attention to these regions. Because of the large amount of 
economic information "software" and the fact that a lot of 
"information" is in the media or even inside people's minds, 
which does not appear like weapons and other hardware as in the 
security and defense fields, the problem can only be solved by 
relying on large numbers of people. Despite the major 
readjustments in U.S. intelligence work, it is noteworthy that 
spending has not decreased. Since the Cold War has ended, some 
congressmen proposed that the intelligence budget should be cut 
by 7 percent each year, just like the defense budget. However, 
actual spending in 1993 could still reach $30 billion, the same 
as prior to the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Some U.S. 
administration officials hold that intelligence is the first 
line of defense for U.S. security, which should be strengthened 
rather than weakened. 
  Reform of the U.S. intelligence system is still under way 
and 
the difficult problems cannot be easily resolved overnight. 
Outstanding problems include: Economic activities are mainly 
regulated by market factors. If the government interferes in 
economic activities, it will be a difficult question to allow 
economic circles to share the information, manifest the 
principles of the market, and avoid agents from getting involved 
in economic activities, which could result in corruption. For 
this reason, it is said that U.S. economic information work is 
focused on combating espionage, rather than taking the 
initiative to launch offensive operations. Moreover, targets 
for the collection of economic information are mainly developed 
nations, many of whom are U.S. allies. Because of the 
intelligence wars arising from this, it has become even more 
difficult to coordinate relations among the western countries, 
which are full of frictions and which have further aggravated 
the lack of trust between them. Shortages of funds have also 
become increasingly prominent. As for its national security 
strategy as a whole, the U.S. intelligence system is still in a 
transitional period and is undergoing major readjustments, which 
will focus on safeguarding the United States' economic and 
practical interests.

  [Text] Moscow, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin stressed on Thursday [20 January] 
the need to curb the inflation, the "biggest problem" for the 
country. 
  Speaking at a news conference held here on Thursday 
afternoon, Chernomyrdin said his government expects inflation to 
run at 15-18 percent a month for the first half of 1994, and 
12-14 percent for the second half of the year, falling to 
perhaps 8-9 percent monthly by the end of the year. 
  "Inflation is and remains the biggest problem" in Russia, he 
pointed out, noting: "Everything else depends on curbing the 
biggest problem." 
  The inflation rate has wavered up or down 20 percent in the 
country in the past months. 
  The government head stressed: "Inflation in Russia no longer 
depends on the activity of one or another government official." 
It is "now fluctuating on its own inertia," he added. 
  Chernomyrdin said attempts at financial stabilization were 
being undermined by two things: on the one hand, the structure 
of the economy and structural problems which have led to 
stagnant investment rates and a decline in production, and on 
the other hand, federal organs of power which sometimes make 
promises which are impossible to fulfil. 
  He told reporters that the newly-formed cabinet proposed to 
"correct the course of reforms." According to him, the essence 
of the correction in the fight against inflation will be that -- 
"we will move from primarily monetaristic tactics to 
non-monetaristic ones, which have been used in many European 
countries." 
  The head of the Russian Government specified that this means 
the foundation of a real competitive market in the Russian 
economy. "That is, in fact, a step towards an increasingly open 
Russian market. All artificial barriers to the entry of foreign 
investments and goods into Russia will be removed." 
  He also stressed that the "president's course of deep and 
democratic reforms in the Russian society has been, is, and will 
be consistently pursued." 
  At the news conference, the prime minister read out the list 
of the new Russian Government signed by President Boris Yeltsin. 
  In the new line-up, Chernomyrdin has one first deputy -- 
Oleg 
Soskovets, and three deputies -- Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Anatoliy 
Chubays, and Yuriy Yarov. 
  He also listed names of ministers. But the final government 
reshuffle has not finished completely, well-informed sources 
here said. 
  In order to raise the government's effectiveness, the number 
of its members was reduced from 93 to 29, the sources confirmed.

  [Text] Moscow, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Russia's jobless 
will hit a record seven million in 1994 compared to last year's 
four million according to official predictions made by the 
government. 
  The huge rise is blamed on further declining production and 
continued changes affecting the business world. 
  In an economic report released recently, the government also 
said that the number of people entitled to unemployment benefits 
this year will reach three million, up dramatically from last 
year's figure of less than 50,000. 
  The report said that the government's major task this year 
is 
to stick to relatively tough financial and monetary policies so 
as to lower the budget deficit and reduce the inflation rate to 
between five and seven percent by the end of 1994. 
  In 1993, the budget deficit consumed about seven percent of 
Russia's general domestic product (GDP), which fell by 12 
percent from the 1992 level due to continued economic recession. 
  Employees are expected to be paid three times more than last 
year's level in terms of face value of their wages, with average 
monthly income hitting 240,000 rubles (about 200 U.S. dollars 
according to the current exchange rate). 
  Meanwhile, commodity wholesale prices will rise by 2.6 
times, 
the report forecast. 
  Reviewing last year's economic situation, the report 
commented that reform efforts toward establishing a market 
economy had led to an increase in the private sector, which 
utilized about 40 percent of the country's labor force. 
  It said as much as 70 percent of Russia's commercial 
businesses, food industry and service trade had been privatized 
by the end of 1993. 
  And the service trade alone produced 42 percent of last 
year's GDP, representing a nine percent increase from that in 
1992, it added. 
  According to the report, about 2,000 commercial banks were 
set up during 1993, while a unified grain market also came into 
shape.

  [Text] Minsk, January 12 (XINHUA) -- Belarus will speed up 
its reforms for a market economy this year despite current 
economic woes caused by hikes of prices for imported raw 
materials from former Soviet republics. 
  In an interview with XINHUA Tuesday [11 January], vice 
chairman of Belarus' Council of Ministers Sergey Stepanovich 
Ling said that the country's ongoing economic reforms are 
irreversible. 
  Moreover, he emphasized, Belarus has laid a "primary 
legislative foundation" to guarantee the continuation of its 
reforms. 
  Twenty bills related to reforms in the economic structure 
and 
the ownership system, including laws on privatization and land 
ownership, were adopted last year. 
  In 1994, the government will take a series of measures, 
including the issuance of privatization bonds three months ahead 
of schedule, to push the reforms forward. 
  But he ruled out the possibility of adopting such radical 
reform policies as "shock therapy." The state "will control the 
pace of reforms" "to ensure their effective continuation," he 
stressed. 
  The vice chairman pointed out that Belarus will pursue a 
"gradual and cautious" reform policy. The former Soviet 
republic will study China's excellent experiences in its reform 
to avoid making mistakes in its own reform, he added. 
  Belarus' advanced industrial equipment and technology and 
the 
good qualifications of its workers will help lead the country 
out of the current economic plight, he said. 
  Belarus, which has to import over 90 percent of the energy 
and raw materials it needs, has met with great difficulty since 
Russia and other former Soviet republics raised prices for 
energy and raw material exports. 
  Belarus witnessed a monthly inflation rate of up to 30 
percent and an unemployment rate of 1.2 percent last year. Many 
factories have stopped production. 
  During the privatization drive, more than 200 state-owned 
enterprises have been privatized so far and reforms have begun 
in finance, commerce and agriculture.

"The Delegation of the Royal Government of Cambodia Has Scored 
Fine Results During its First Visit to China" -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] A delegation of the Royal Government of Cambodia 
[RGC] led by Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime 
minister, and Hun Sen, second prime minister, paid an official 
five-day visit to China from 17 to 21 January at the invitation 
of Chinese Premier Li Peng. 
  After the RGC delegation's arival in Beijing, Prime Minister 
Li Peng hosted a solemn reception on 17 January to welcome the 
Cambodian guests of honor. This is the first visit to China by 
the two prime ministers after peace returned to Cambodia and 
after the establishment of the new royal government of Cambodia. 
The aim of this visit is to promote mutual understanding 
between the two countries' leaders and to increase economic 
cooperation between the two countries. This is a major event in 
the history of Sino- Cambodian relations. 
  The visit to China by the delegation jointly led by the two 
prime ministers, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, 
shows that the RGC pays attention to expanding friendly 
relations and cooperation between China and Cambodia. The 
traditional friendship between China and Cambodia has a long 
history. The visit to China by the RGC delegation is of great 
significance in the new situation. 
  During the visit to Beijing, the RGC delegation exchanged 
views with Chinese leaders, namely President Jiang Zemin and 
Prime Minister Li Peng, on regional and international issues of 
interest to both sides. President Jiang Zemin said that the 
situation in Cambodia underwent great and historic changes in 
1993. He spoke during a meeting with Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, first prime minister, and Hun Sen, second prime 
minister. Cambodia, which has been a victim of war for over 20 
years, has entered a new phase with peace and reconstruction. 
The Chinese Government sincerely hopes that the RGC will take 
care of the this arduously-acquired peaceful situation, further 
promote the national reconciliation process, and finally achieve 
full national reconciliation and work together to rebuild 
Cambodia. Jiang Zemin said that China will continue to provide 
assistance according to its means to the rehabilitation and 
reconstruction process in Cambodia. 
  Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh said that the RGC pays 
attention to expanding friendly relations and cooperation with 
China. On behalf of the RGC and the Cambodian people, he 
thanked China for providing assistance during the transitional 
period and to the process to rebuild Cambodia. 
  Prime Minister Li Peng said that Cambodia has entered a new 
and historic phase in which peace will be restored. The Chinese 
Government and people sincerely hope that Cambodia will become a 
neutral and nonaligned country and that the RGC, under the 
leadership of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, and will 
resolve its internal problems well in accordance with the spirit 
of national reconciliation to maintain Cambodia's peace and 
stability and to rally all forces to rebuild the country. 
  Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh said that the RGC, 
through 
this visit, hopes to further expand the friendly relations and 
cooperation in every field between the two countries on the 
basis of equality and mutual interest. He expressed the 
conviction that the RGC and the Cambodian people will be able to 
gradually restore and expand the economy with the assistance of 
the international community. The Chinese Government and the RGC 
also signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement in 
Beijing. 
  The RGC ended its visit in Beijing and left for Hainan and 
Guangdong Provinces in southern China on 19 January. Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen visited centers of 
industrial and technical development and Chinese-foreign joint 
enterprises in these two provinces. Apart from this, the 
delegation also held separate talks with the governors of these 
two provinces. 
  The two Cambodian prime ministers praised the achievements 
of 
these two provinces in building their economies. Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh said the Kingdom of Cambodia's 
economy is going through a period of rebuilding. Experiences 
from the reforms in Hainan and Guangdong Provinces are worth 
learning from. He welcomed investment by and cooperation with 
Chinese enterprises in Cambodia. 
  The RGC delegation ended its friendly visit to China and 
left 
Guangzhou for home on 21 January. This is a visit that has 
increased cooperation and friendship. This visit has scored 
fine results.

  [Text] Antananaivo, 19 Jan (XINHUA) -- Malagasy President 
Albert Zafy received Qian Qichen, China's State Council vice 
premier and foreign minister, here this afternoon. 
  President Zafy warmly welcomed Qian Qichen. He said: The 
current visit will surely further enhance the development of 
friendly and cooperative ties between the two countries. 
  Qian Qichen said: Sino-Malagasy relations have a sound 
foundation. The Chinese and Malagasy Governments will make 
joint efforts to continuously consolidate and develop the 
friendship between the peoples of the two countries and push 
forward the development of bilateral economic and technological 
cooperation. 
  Qian Qichen conveyed President Jiang Zemin's cordial regards 
and good wishes to President Zafy. He said: President Jiang 
looks forward to President Zafy's visit to China this year. 
  President Zafy pointed out: Madagascar and China have many 
points in common. The Malagasy Government highly treasures our 
friendly ties with China. 
  Touching on the situation in Africa, Qian Qichen said: The 
process of decolonization in Africa has taken nearly half a 
century. Currently, the African nations are still in a stage of 
exploring how to develop their own economies. He stressed: The 
practice of China's construction has proven that one cannot gain 
success by indiscriminately copying and imitating the 
experiences of other countries. The important thing is to 
proceed from the realities of your own country, combine them 
with and draw from the experiences of other countries, while 
seeking your own path of development. 
  President Zafy endorsed Qian Qichen's views. He said: The 
African people are increasingly aware of the importance of 
acting independently and having the initiative in their own 
hands, and of relying on themselves to develop their countries. 
Notwithstanding that presently Africa has encountered 
difficulties, it has its own superiorities. 
  Earlier on, Malagasy speaker Andriamahazo met with Qian 
Qichen, and both sides exchanged views on how to further 
strengthen contacts between the national assemblies of the two 
countries. 
  Qian Qichen and his party left Madagascar this afternoon for 
a visit to Mauritius.

  [Text] Port Louis, 20 Jan (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, the 
visiting Chinese vice premier and foreign minister, met with 
Mauritian Foreign Minister Kasenally this afternoon. 
  At the meeting, Qian Qichen pointed out: Since the 
establishment of Sino-Mauritian diplomatic relations, exchange 
and cooperation between the two countries in the political, 
economic, and cultural areas have expanded continually. The 
Chinese Government has always cherished friendship with 
Mauritius and is ready to work together with the Mauritian 
Government in exploring new ways for mutually beneficial 
cooperation. 
  Kasenally believed that Qian Qichen's visit would certainly 
result in the deepening of mutual understanding and expansion of 
cooperation, especially in the economic and trade fields, 
between the two countries. 
  The two foreign ministers briefed each other on their 
respective country's stance on the conflict in Somalia, problems 
in South Africa, reform of the Security Council, and the 
establishment of a new international political and economic 
order. 
  Qian Qichen said: Under the new international situation, 
many African countries are facing aggravating difficulties and 
widening their gap with the developed countries. To reform the 
irrational economic order and help African countries shake off 
poverty is a pressing task facing the international community. 
Only when the economy of the African countries shows 
improvement can the global economy grow healthily. Africa's 
development needs the support of the world, and Africa's 
participation is also essential for the development of the world. 
  Kasenally pointed out: The solution to problems in Somalia 
and other African nations will depend primarily on their 
peoples. He said: It is necessary to bring into play the OAU's 
role instead of relying on solutions imposed externally. The 
establishment of an international order must be participated by 
all small and big nations on an equal footing and must not be 
manipulated by one or two blocs again. 
  Prior to the meeting, the two foreign ministers attended a 
ceremony to sign an agreement on the Chinese Government's 
donation of general goods to Mauritius, and signed the agreement 
for their respective governments. 
  Qian Qichen and his party arrived in Mauritius on the 
evening 
of 19 January for a two-day goodwill visit to the island country 
in the Indian Ocean.

  [Text] Port Louis, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, Chinese 
vice premier and foreign minister, departed here for Paris early 
this evening after successfully concluding a visit to six 
African nations -- Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Kenya, Madagascar, 
and Mauritius. On the eve of his departure from Port Louis, 
Qian Qichan discussed the situation in Africa and China's 
African policy in an interview with XINHUA reporters. 
  Qian Qichen said: During the current African tour, he has 
been deeply impressed by the African people's new sense of 
awakening sparked by drastic changes in the international 
situation. Many African countries, while seeking economic 
development, have focused their attention on safeguarding 
national stability and at the same time, strengthened regional 
cooperation. Noting the establishment of security mechanisms by 
OAU and the breakthrough achieved in peace in South Africa, he 
pointed out that the struggle against foreign intervention and 
for national independence and sovereignty is making headway. In 
short, Africa is facing challenges as well as historic 
opportunities and is not without hopes, he added. 
  He said: Under the new situation brought about by the end of 
the Cold War, regions are interrelated in their endeavor for 
peace and various countries have become more and more 
interdependent on each other in economy. World peace is 
inseparable from Africa's stability; and an underdeveloped 
African economy is not conducive to the global economic 
prosperity. For this reason, the international community should 
show concern for Africa, and the developed nations are 
duty-bound to help the African countries. Africa needs 
attention, not indifference; it needs help, not intervention. 
  Discussing China's African policy, Qian Qichen emphasized: 
To strengthen unity and cooperation with the African and other 
developing countries is the basis of China's foreign policy. 
China shares much common ground with the African countries as 
far as the international and regional situations are concerned. 
China wholly respects the social system and development mode 
chosen by the African countries in light of their national 
conditions, and firmly supports the African countries' struggle 
to safeguard national independence and sovereignty. We support 
the African countries' efforts to ensure internal unity, to 
develop economy, and to improve the people's livelihood; and we 
also support the series of rational proposals by African 
countries for reducing and exempting debts, protecting economic 
interests, and strengthening South-South cooperation and 
South-North dialogue. 
  On China's economic and trade relations with African, Qian 
Qichen said: China's economic cooperation with the African 
countries symbolizes the spirit of mutual benefit and assistance 
and common development. He added that although China's 
assistance to African countries is limited, it is sincere and 
without any political strings attached. 
  He pointed out: Amidst constant changes in the international 
and African scenes, the friendship between China and Africa has 
withstood tests of history and become more solid. China will 
never forget Africa's profound sentiments of friendship in times 
of needs. He reiterated that regardless of changes in the 
international and African situations, China will never alter its 
principle of developing unity and cooperation with the African 
countries. We deeply believe that our friendship with Africa 
will definitely continue to grow and strengthen in the days and 
years to come; and the lasting, stable, and mutually 
beneficially friendship and cooperation between China and Africa 
will further solidify and develop.

<F P=106> [By reporter Gao Jian (7559 1017)] </F>
  [Text] United Nations, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- A Chinese 
representative said here today that only by making a definite 
commitment to the complete prohibition and thorough destruction 
of nuclear weapons and by adopting appropriate and resolute 
steps to that end will the measures of nuclear states to prevent 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons have a genuine significance. 
  The second session of the preparatory committee for the 1995 
conference of parties to the Treaty on Nonproliferation of 
Nuclear Weapons was convened this week at the United Nations 
Headquarters in New York. Sha Zukang, head of the Chinese 
delegation to the session expounded China's views on how to 
effectively prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
  Sha Zukang said China recognizes the importance of the 
prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons as well as 
the maintenance of an effective international legal mechanism 
for that purpose. At the same time, China also believes that 
nonproliferation by itself is not the ultimate goal that the 
mankind should pursue, and that the real objective should be 
complete prohibition, thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, 
and realization of a nuclear-free world. 
  Sha Zukang believes that only by making a definite 
commitment 
and by adopting appropriate and resolute steps to that end will 
the measures of nuclear states to prevent the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons have a genuine significance. He said failure to 
do that will perpetuate the defect of the existing imbalance in 
the treaty in the rights and obligations between the nuclear and 
nonnuclear states. To realize quickly the objective of the 
total prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, a 
large number of nonnuclear countries have given up the option of 
acquiring and developing nuclear weapons; however, their demand 
for security guarantees has not been fundamentally satisfied. 
  Sha Zukang said the Chinese Government believes that 
conditions are ripe for all nuclear states to make the 
commitment of not being the first to use nuclear weapons and not 
to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear 
states and nuclear free zones. 
  Sha Zukang criticized some big nuclear powers for a lack of 
sincerity for peace in this respect. He said if nuclear 
states, particularly the big nuclear powers with global nuclear 
attack capability, are unable to take even the limited step of 
guaranteeing that they will not be the first to use nuclear 
weapons and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons 
against nonnuclear states and nuclear free zones, how can they 
expect the large number of nonnuclear states to trust their 
sincerity for peace. 
  He pointed out that it will be difficult to ensure 
universality and enduring effectiveness for the international 
nuclear nonproliferation mechanism if nuclear states only make 
one-sided emphasis on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons 
and if they only emphasize their own absolute security to the 
neglect of the nonnuclear states' legitimate security concerns.

"A Few Remarks on the Fruit of Clinton's Trip to Europe"] 
  [Text] After concluding his nine-day visit to Europe, U.S. 
President Clinton returned to Washington travel weary on 17 
January. Clinton had had quite a fruitful trip, yet naturally it 
was not without unaccomplished tasks. 
  The further establishment of the loose relations between the 
United States and its West European allies was the U.S. 
President's first achievement. Since the cold war ended, with 
the disbandment of the Warsaw Pact, the disintegration of the 
the Soviet Union, and the changes in the balance of strength on 
the European continent, West European nations' wish to run their 
own business independently has been rising with each passing 
day. At the NATO summit in Brussels on 10-11 January, the 
United States "delegated power" and the summit approved that the 
West European Union may, when necessary, use NATO's armaments to 
execute actions without participation of the United States. 
This decision suits the reality of West Europe today, so all 
the member nations were very happy about it. To the United 
States, this decision stabilizes relations across the Atlantic 
Ocean and also safeguards U.S. interests. 
  The second achievement was the signing with Russia and 
Ukraine a treaty on the destruction of all nuclear weapons in 
Ukrainian territory. According to the treaty, Ukraine is to 
destroy 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 1,500 
nuclear heads deployed in its territory. Clinton felt relieved. 
One should know that this was a thorn in the side of the United 
States that it had always wanted to remove. Now they have done 
it, at last. 
  The third achievement was the meeting with Syrian President 
al- Asad in Geneva, Switzerland, in which he urged Syria to 
reach an agreement with Israel on the Golan Heights. This 
gesture was meant to show the world that the United States has 
played a role in the peace process in the Middle East. Clinton 
scored on diplomacy. 
  Of all the unaccomplished tasks, the most conspicuous one 
was 
how the "peaceful partnership" plan could be implemented. This 
plan was put forward by the United States and approved at the 
NATO summit. It was designed to slow down the pace of four 
Central European nations, namely, Poland, Hungary, Czech, and 
Slovakia, joining NATO and not to cause Russia to feel insecure 
about the NATO's eastward expansion. The four Central European 
nations thought the United States was not friendly enough and 
was quite unhappy about it, though there was hardly anything 
they could do. But ironically, there have been criticisms on 
this plan from among NATO member states. German Chancellor Kohl 
hinted that the future European Union may consider accepting 
Central European countries first. French President Mitterrand 
put it point-blank by emphasizing that the "peaceful 
partnership" plan had not been put forward by France and France 
rementioned the concept of a "Federation of European States," 
which is to include Central and East Europe nations. That this 
plan has already caused such controversy since it was set forth 
just a few days ago seems to indicate that greater fun is yet to 
come!

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 16 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) expected to see improvement in 
the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks. 
  The official newspaper "NODONG SINMUN" said in a commentary 
that the United States and DPRK should hold their talks on the 
basis of mutual understanding and cooperation. 
  It added that threats and pressure would only lead to a 
worse 
situation. 
  The commentary stressed that only dialogue and negotiation 
could solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in a just 
way. 
  It also appealed to South Korea not to hamper the U.S-DPRK 
talks which "would seek interests for all Koreans." 
  After two rounds of high-level talks and several contacts 
since last year, the two countries have reached agreements on 
some issues. On December 30, 1993, the United States declared 
that it would stop the annual "Team Spirit" joint military 
exercises with South Korea while DPRK agreed to accept necessary 
international inspections of its suspected nuclear facilities to 
guarantee their security. 
  Meanwhile, the two sides agreed to hold a third round of 
talks on a package of plans to solve the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Canberra, January 20 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea [DPRK] has contacted Australia on the 
possibility to restore diplomatic ties between the two 
countries, a spokesman of the Australian Foreign Affairs 
Department told XINHUA this morning. 
  Officials of Korea have recently held secret talks with 
Australian diplomats in Jakarta and Bangkok on the reopening of 
diplomatic dialogue between the two governments, the spokesman 
said. 
  The move came 19 years after diplomatic ties between the two 
countries broke down in 1975 when Australia backed South Korea 
in the United Nations. 
  The Australian Government is considering the proposal by the 
DPRK, but "no decisions have been made at present", the 
spokesman stressed. 
  However, it will be "an option" for Australia to invite a 
North Korean official at junior minister level to visit Canberra 
later this year to discuss the issue, he said. 
  It is understood that Australia has made it clear that some 
conditions will have to be met by Pyongyang before the ties 
between the two countries can be renewed. 
  The conditions include North Korea allowing international 
inspectors into the country to examine its nuclear facilities 
and resumption of high-level talks between North Korea, South 
Korea and the United States. 
  If Australia restores diplomatic links with the DPRK, it 
will 
be the first English-speaking western country to do so. 
  The Australian Government has informed the U.S., Japan and 
South Korea of the approach by the DPRK, the spokesman said.

(7458 4423 5468)] 
  [Text] Bonn, 20 Jan (XINHUA) -- German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl met with Qiao Shi, visiting chairman of China's National 
People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, at the chancellor's 
office here on 20 January. Chancellor Kohl and Chairman Qiao 
held a conversation which lasted about an hour in a cordial, 
friendly, and warm atmosphere. 
  Kohl first expressed his warm welcome to Qiao Shi's visit 
and 
recalled his own visit to China last November. The two also met 
during the chancellor's visit to China. 
  Qiao Shi conveyed greetings to Kohl from President Jiang 
Zemin and Premier Li Peng. Kohl also asked Qiao Shi to convey 
his greetings to them. 
  Qiao Shi expressed great pleasures at visiting Germany in 
the 
wake of Chancellor Kohl's successful visit to China. He said 
that he has gained a better understanding of Germany and has 
learned many things through extensive contacts during the trip. 
He said he believed that Sino-German cooperation has produced 
good results and that the series of agreements signed in Beijing 
between the two countries during Kohl's visit to China last 
November will be fully implemented. 
  Qiao Shi stressed: In developing its relations with Germany, 
China focuses not only on this century but also on the 21st 
century. China approaches its relations with Germany from a 
strategic point of view. 
  He expressed the hope that China and Germany will develop 
long- term and stable friendship and cooperation over the next 
century based on the principles of seeking common ground while 
reserving differences; mutual trust, equality, and mutual 
benefit. 
  In pointing out the series of important agreements signed in 
Beijing last November, Kohl pledged to abide by the things that 
he promised. He said he believed that Germany and China share 
special ties and that the two countries should closely cooperate 
not only in the economic field but also in other areas, such as 
science and technology and culture. He indicated that he will 
work hard for this. 
  He pointed out: China has always supported Germany's 
reunification, and Germany will continue to support China's 
reunification as it has done in the past. 
  During the meeting, Qiao briefed Kohl in detail on China's 
reform, opening up, and economic construction, as well as on the 
policies and measures adopted by the Chinese Government. 
  Qiao Shi's wife, Yu Wen, and Cao Zhi, NPC Standing Committee 
secretary general, were present at the meeting.

21 January transmits a service message canceling the following 
item and asking it be replaced with another version; differences 
between the two items noted below; feature by reporter Hu Xudong 
(5170 2485 2639): "Chairman Qiao Shi at `Benz'; variant version 
reads: "Chairman Qiao Shi Visits Benz Company," replacing "at 
`Benz'" with "Visits Benz Company"] 
  [Text] Stuttgart, 20 January -- "5, 4, 3, 2...." Before 
"1" was announced in the countdown, a Benz car slammed into an 
obstacle with a loud "bang" and, meanwhile, a safety air cushion 
was instantly ejected out of the steering wheel inside the car 
while the "driver" remained safe and sound [variant version 
reads: ...in the countdown, a safety air cushion was instantly 
ejected out of the steering wheel, sending up a light smoke. 
This was a scene simulating a car collision in the Benz auto 
company....]. 
  The Chinese subtitles reading "Welcome Your Visit to the 
Benz 
Company Safety Research Division" were shown on the wall in the 
hall for the collision simulation test. The visit by Qiao Shi, 
chairman of the PRC National People's Congress Standing 
Committee, and his entourage to the Benz auto company, one of 
Germany's most famous enterprises, reached a climax here 
[variant version reads: ...National People's Congress, to the 
Benz auto company reached a climax here... deleting "and his 
entourage" and "one of Germany's most famous enterprises"]. 
  Safety in driving a car has become the crucial point of auto 
research and development [variant version reads: ...research and 
development now... adding "now"]. It is learned that the Benz 
auto company is one of the earliest auto manufacturers to use 
safety air bags in their products. 
  Qiao Shi and his party arrived at Sindelfingen city near 
Stuttgart for a visit to the Benz headquarters at 1630 today. 
Accompanied by President (Lloyd) of the Benz group, Qiao Shi 
visited the Benz company's new car exhibition hall first. 
Various new Benz cars were on display in this round hall which 
occupies several hundred square meters. Qiao Shi listened with 
keen interest to a company briefing on various new models of 
Benz cars, and raised questions from time to time. 
  "Does this car have automatic gear shifting? Is it 
electronically controlled?" 
  "Yes." 
  "How many cylinders does it have?" 
  "There are four, six, and eight cylinders." 
  "What kind of gas does it use?" 
  "Super unleaded." 
  "How much gas does it consume per 100 km?" 
  "Ten to 20 liters per 100 km, depending on the number of 
cylinders and capacity." 
  Pointing at the star-shaped emblem in the front of a car, 
(Lloyd) said: "This is an article most liable to theft. We 
must produce a large number of emblems as spares every year." 
Qiao Shi and other visitors burst out laughing. 
  Standing in front of a beautiful convertible, Qiao Shi said 
humorously: "This is very suitable for youngsters. They like 
to go for a drive." 
  When Qiao Shi and his party came to the place where a heavy 
truck was on display, their host said that the Benz company had 
signed an agreement with China to produce this kind of truck in 
China. Qiao Shi enquired with concern: "What is its loading 
capacity?" Their host replied: "Eighteen tonnes. Plus the 
weight of the truck itself, it has a total capacity of 40 
tonnes. However, the weight of the truck China is to produce is 
altered to 36 tonnes." At this point, (Lloyd) pointed at a 
colleague standing beside him and said jokingly: "He drives 
this kind of truck like a racing car, speeding at 280 km per 
hour on the freeway." Another burst of laughter. 
  Then, Qiao Shi visited an assembling shop. At last, he came 
to the safety research division hall for car collision 
simulation tests. On display in the hall were cars damaged by 
collisions at different angles. The responsible person for the 
safety research division demonstrated a simulated car collision 
controlled by computer. Qiao Shi was very interested. More 
than once, he walked close to a damaged part to take a careful 
look while he was listening to a briefing. The responsible 
person of the safety research division said: "Indeed, Benz auto 
technology and safety are the best, but their prices are a 
little too high." Chairman Qiao Shi said: "So long as you pay 
further attention to technology, you can gain an upper hand in 
the competition all the same."

  [Text] Munich, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Top Chinese 
legislator Qiao Shi said here today that he has full confidence 
in China's reform. 
  Qiao, chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) 
Standing Committee, made the statement in talks with Wilhelm 
Vorndran, president of Bavaria state's parliament. 
  Qiao noted that 1994 is an important year for China's 
deepening reform, during which many important measures will be 
taken. 
  Qiao stressed, "The aim of our reform is to accelerate the 
building of the country's market economic system and quicken the 
pace for economic construction." 
  "We also need to strengthen cooperation with the 
international community, and in adopting measures for the reform 
we are seeking conformity with the international community," he 
added. 
  He said that tariffs readjustment will help restore China's 
status as a signatory party to the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT). 
  Qiao told Vorndran, "We are still facing an arduous task of 
drawing up laws and we will initially set up a frame structure 
for the legal system to meet the requirements of the market 
economy within the five-year term of the Eighth National 
People's Congress." 
  In this regard, China should draw on the experiences of 
foreign countries, he added. 
  Qiao said he is very pleased to see the sound growth of 
bilateral ties, including the relationship between China and the 
state of Bavaria. 
  He expressed the hope that such relationship will not only 
involve economic cooperation, but also cooperation in culture, 
education, science and technology. 
  Prior to the talks, Vorndran hosted a welcoming ceremony for 
Qiao and his party. 
  Bavaria state and China have enjoyed very good ties, 
Vorndran 
said, adding that Qiao's visit will give a new impetus to such 
ties. 
  He said he is glad that China will set up a 
consulate-general 
in Munich which, he said, is an indication of the developing 
relations between Bavaria state and China. 
  Qiao noted that as early as the 1980s, Bavaria state 
established a partnership with Shandong Province in east China, 
and its cooperation with other parts of China has also been 
fruitful. 
  "It is certain that my visit to Bavaria will produce 
abundant 
results," he added. 
  Earlier today, Qiao and his party visited BMW Limited 
Company, the 11th largest industrial enterprise in Germany.

  [Text] Munich, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met 
here today with Edmund Stoiber, governor of Germany's Bavaria 
state. 
  Official sources said that during the meeting they exchanged 
views on issues of common concern in a sincere and candid way 
and the meeting proceeded in a friendly atmosphere. 
  Stoiber said, China is playing a more and more important 
role 
in the world economy and the state of Bavaria intends to enhance 
its relations with the nation. 
  He told Qiao that he was deeply impressed by China's rapid 
economic growth and is expected to visit China within this year. 
  China has a huge market, which is of great significance to 
Germany, and especially to the economic development in Asia and 
the rest of the world in the next century, he said. 
  The governor also appreciated China's unremitting efforts in 
seeking peace in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Later this afternoon, Qiao met with Dr. Heinrich von Pierer, 
chairman of the Siemens company. The company now has more than 
20 joint or invested enterprises in China. 
  During German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to China last 
November, the two countries signed a protocol on the joint 
construction of the Guangzhou sub-way project and a loan 
agreement. 
  Qiao said Siemens is a very good cooperative partner of 
China. The future for cooperation between the two sides is 
bright. 
  Pierer said Siemens is looking attentively at China's 
economic reform. 
  "We are full of confidence in China's future," he added.

deep and wonderful impression. 
  He said his talks with Suessmuth and meetings with other 
German leaders were added proof that China and Germany have 
extensive shared interests in the current complex and changing 
world situation. 
  To further develop bilateral cooperation of friendship is 
not

ties," he added. 
  Germany was Qiao's first leg of a three-nation West European 
tour which also takes him to Switzerland and Austria.

  [Text] Bonn, January 23 (XINHUA) -- China's top lawmaker 
Qiao Shi ended a successful eight-day official visit to Germany 
today, which is expected to give impetus to the development of 
friendly relations between the two countries. 
  Qiao's was the first visit to Germany by chairman of China's 
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, marking a 
major event in the history of Sino-German relations. 
  During his visit, Qiao held separate talks with German 
President Richard Von Weizsacker, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and 
Federal Assembly (parliament) President Rita Suessmuth. 
  He told German leaders that both China and Germany are 
major, 
influential nations which have no conflict of interests between 
them and share common or similar views on international issues. 
  The economies of the two countries can be mutually 
complementary, and there are broad vistas for the development of 
friendly relations, he said. 
  Over the past three years relations between the two 
countries 
have developed smoothly, with an exchange of visits by foreign 
ministers and other senior officials. 
  Bilateral relations have entered a new phase of overall 
development since Chancellor Kohl visited China last November 
and signed a series of agreements on promotion of bilateral 
relations and cooperation. 
  During Kohl's stay in China, Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
stressed that the two countries should handle bilateral 
relations from a long-term point of view, not only looking to 
this century, but the next as well. 
  In Bonn, Qiao echoed Jiang's call by saying that the two 
sides should view and handle bilateral relations from strategic 
point of views. 
  Such positive remarks indicate that the development of Sino- 
German relations will gain new momentum. 
  Bonn was Qiao's first leg on a three-nation European tour, 
which will also take him to Switzerland and Austria.

  [Text] Munich, January 23 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman 
of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, 
today ended his eight-day official goodwill visit to Germany 
with fruitful results. 
  Qiao's first trip to Germany is regarded as a major event in 
the history of Sino-German ties. 
  Sources from the NPC described the tour as "successful" and 
said that "anticipated results have been achieved during the 
visit." 
  The visit has promoted mutual understanding and friendship, 
and expanded bilateral cooperation, exchanges between the two 
parliaments in particular, the sources said. 
  The visit shows that the two sides attach great importance 
to 
further enhancing bilateral ties and have made earnest efforts 
to this end. 
  The economies of the two countries are mutually 
complementary. So there exists a sound basis for developing 
bilateral cooperation. 
  The situation over the past three years has demonstrated 
that 
the evaluation of bilateral ties that Qiao has made is 
completely correct. 
  Qiao said during the visit that the two sides should treat 
and handle their mutual relations from a strategic viewpoint. 
  Meanwhile, Qiao met with many German entrepreneurs, spent 
hours touring the Mercedes-Benz bodyshell and assembly plant in 
Sindelfingen, and discussed with the leaders of the Siemens 
Company future cooperation between the two sides. 
  While visiting the Sindelfingen plant, Qiao was informed 
about the passenger car and commercial vehicle ranges as well as 
the Daimler-Benz group's current projects in China. 
  Edzard Reuter, chairman of the Daimler-Benz AG, was 
confident 
in Sindelfingen's economic cooperation with China. "We are 
determined to reinforce our activity in this region and to 
continuously maintain and extend our relations with our 
partners," he noted. 
  Reuter said that more contracts will be concluded with China 
and more investments made in that country in addition to the 
current and planned major projects such as the production of 
buses, equipping the metro systems in Shanghai and Guangzhou, 
delivering 23 Airbus planes as well as developing and producing 
telecommunication satellites. 
  Qiao said he has full confidence in such cooperation.

<F P=106> [By Political Editor Mary Binks] </F>
  [Text] Governor Chris Patten left Hong Kong last night for 
London, taking a parting swipe at China's conduct in the row 
over the territory's political and economic future. Intending 
to conduct strategy talks in London with British Prime Minister 
John Major and senior cabinet ministers, Mr Patten reiterated a 
stern warning to China not to mix politics and economics. 
  He intimated China might have more to lose than Britain if 
it 
did so. "China has pretty well a two-to-one trade surplus with 
the United Kingdom," Mr Patten said. "China has attempted to 
join the Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), an 
application which has the United Kingdom's and, of course, the 
Hong Kong Government's enthusiastic support. And countries 
which join Gatt don't behave in the sort of way that has been 
suggested by one or two Chinese officials." 
  Since the Sino-British negotiations broke down, Mr Patten's 
relations with Beijing have been strained and acrimonious. 
  Britain has now embarked on unilateral constitutional reform 
in Hong Kong, but he stressed that the door to negotiations on 
the contentious issues surrounding the final elections under 
British rule was still open. With the first part of his 
constitutional reform package now before the legislature Mr 
Patten has made it clear the remainder will not be introduced 
until after that bill is approved. The bill needs to be 
approved by the end of the month, leaving the way clear for the 
remainder of the constitutional reform package to be introduced 
in March. 
  Mr Patten will seek cabinet backing to take this course of 
action when he meets senior ministers in London on Monday. "I 
don't think you should expect any dramatic announcements," he 
said. "The position is one I think the community well 
understands. We want to go on talking to Chinese officials 
about the three outstanding contentious issues (surrounding the 
1995 Legislative Council elections). "We're happy to go on 
talking until that moment when we have to begin legislating on 
the remaining matters which have to be resolved for the 1995 
elections. We hope that the talks can be resumed, and if that's 
not the case we will have to try with the Legislative Council to 
put in place arrangements which are acceptable to Hong Kong," Mr 
Patten said. 
  Today, he will begin his strategy talks with the British 
Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren, and the minister 
responsible for Hong Kong, Alastair Goodlad.

<F P=106> [By David Wallen in London] </F>
  [Text] Governor Chris Patten last night spelled out for 
the first time that if the Legislative Council refuses to pass 
his democracy blueprint for the 1995 polls he might either 
revert to the 1991 formula or put forward entirely new 
legislation. 
  Mr. Patten was at his most forthright yet in a marathon 
two-hour 20-minute grilling before the Commons Foreign Affairs 
Select Committee -- ruling out a referendum, insisting 
legislators voted in in 1995 would not be a "Trojan horse" for 
Britain and fiercely, while succinctly attacking both China and 
his British adversary Sir Percy Cradock. In a sometimes emotive 
performance he praised the people of Hong Kong. 
  "I do get angry sometimes at the contempt shown for the 
people in Hong Kong who have created one of the most successful 
economies in the world and who have shown remarkable 
sophistication in every aspect of life and who are expected to 
continue to create one of the most successful economies in the 
world in a political vacuum. 
  "They say of the people of the 10th most successful economy 
in the world that it contains a population who aren't capable of 
deciding who should collect their dustbins." 
  Mr. Patten told the all-party committee investigating 
relations between Britain and China that it was his "firm, 
sincere hope" that discussions could be resumed although time 
was very short. "I still hope that the negotiations can be 
resumed at any time and when the Chinese side give us the nod 
our officials will be on the plane to Beijing." 
  He explained that if Legco refused to pass either of two 
tranches of his democracy package then he would face 
difficulties constitutionally. "You can't legislate on very 
close terrain to that on which you have lost the battle. 
  "The options would be either to try a different approach and 
put forward different legislation or to decide that we have to 
settle for existing arrangements in a re-run in 1995." 
  Asked by Tory MP David Sumberg whether or not a referendum 
was viable, Mr. Patten insisted that opinion polls over and over 
again had shown support for his package. A referendum would not 
resolve the issue because Legco would still have to pass 
legislation. 
  He added sternly: "It is an issue completely neuralgic to 
the Chinese side and I am not in the business of trying to tweak 
Chinese tails. China regards it as the ultimate sin and I don't 
think it is very sensible to take on more arguments in a day 
than is absolutely necessary." 
  The MPs questioned Mr. Patten in detail over the whole gamut 
of Hong Kong issues. The Governor revealed that soon he would 
have to go ahead with the localisation of laws unilaterally 
because of the lack of progress in the JLG. He insisted he 
would continue to press "with great vigour" for UK passports for 
both the 52 war widows and the 7,000-strong ethnic community. 
The Governor meets Home Secretary Michael Howard today to take 
up these issues. 
  He also disclosed that before he goes ahead and tables the 
second set of democracy legislation he will publish the full 
details of how the talks progressed and finally broke down. "I 
think it would be very difficult to justify further legislation 
without filling in that background," he said. 
  The Commons committee room was crammed with more than 70 
diplomats press and members of the public, including four 
officials from the Chinese Embassy for the hearing: Those who 
could not fit in heard Mr. Patten give evidence through a sound 
system to an overflow room. 
  The Governor admitted as he began his evidence that his was 
"a difficult job all round and no one should be too surprised or 
too censorious that it is occasionally a more bracing or 
bruising experience than any of us would like". Even before he 
arrived the relationship with China had not been blessed with as 
much co- operation as Britain would have liked. 
  "We have not been arguing with China about increasing the 
pace at which the legislature is democratised, though some think 
we should have been. 
  "What is at issue is whether those arrangements are fair or 
unfair. That is the nub of the argument. 
  "Should it not be possible to reach agreement with China on 
this issue then we will have to proceed with legislation. 
  "We will work with and through the legislature, not going 
further than the community wishes, but not going less far 
either." 
  Mr. Patten pulled few punches in his description of the 
Chinese approach. "I think it has been pretty irrational, 
largely rhetorical and usually devoid of argument," he said. 
  He detailed to the MPs the talks with Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen in New York, prior to his first 
announcement of the democracy package and how this was passed on 
to the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office by the British Embassy 
in Beijing. 
  Mr. Patten said Sir Percy Cradock's suggestion that Britain 
had refused consultations at that stage was "completely untrue". 
  He accused the Chinese of using traditional tactics in 
trying 
to personalise their attacks on him and isolating individuals 
they did not agree with. 
  It was "ludicrous" to suppose that any governor could 
conduct 
policy which produced this degree of controversy off his own 
back. He was a politician and very sensitive to public 
accountability-- more so than others might have been. 
  Tory MP Sir John Stanley asked why he had gone for a policy 
of defiance, as it was described by Sir Percy. But Mr. Patten 
accused the former ambassador to Beijing of not saying what he 
would settle for. Mr. Patten said the 17 rounds of talks had 
"reached the end of the elastic" when they were called off. 
  Asked why he had not gone to Beijing prior to announcing his 
package, he said that if he had that would make "lame ducks look 
pretty agile".

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Person Who Undermines Cooperation Must </F>
Bear Blame"] 
  [Text] Chris Patten's mood may be worse during his current 
trip to Britain for consultations, because the situation has 
changed, the international environment has become unfavorable to 
him, and so has the domestic situation in Britain. British 
business circles are no longer concerned about whether his 
constitutional reform package will be passed by the Legislative 
Council, and they have noted that his unilateral legislation was 
an erroneous action. His countrymen asked him to make it plain 
how the trade interests of British business would be harmed and 
whether British-Chinese relations would turn for the better 
after the talks on the Hong Kong issue broke down. 
  Therefore, this time, Patten was in no mood to put on 
"political shows" by appearing on British television or 
arranging interviews with British newspapers; instead, he 
hastily consulted some "China hands" about countermeasures, and 
tried to cope with the huge pressures from the British business 
community. He discussed ways to deal with the Chinese with 
former foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe, and discussed how to 
handle the deadlocked situation after the breakdown of talks 
with Ambassador McLaren and Foreign Minister Goodlad. 
  When he was appointed Hong Kong governor and was on his way 
to take office in Hong Kong, he vowed to maintain good relations 
with China in front of some British businessmen who supported 
his appointment. He said that he would build up trust with his 
Chinese counterparts and would be able to solve many issues by 
just dialing the phone. He meant that as Britain had appointed 
such an able Hong Kong governor, British businessmen would gain 
favor everywhere in their China trade. 
  However, all people have seen that he behaved in an 
extremely 
irresponsible way by challenging the established agreements 
between China and Britain, refusing to make things converge with 
the Basic Law, and recklessly bringing part of the controversial 
constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council before 
an agreement had been reached, and all this was unnecessary. 
Patten ruined all of the progress that had been made in the 
past and caused the breakdown of the talks without regard to the 
interests of the residents of Hong Kong and the interests of 
British businessmen. He simply made a mess of the situation and 
broke the promises he made when he took office. 
  Therefore, at a hearing in the British Parliament, David 
Howell and other Conservative MP's questioned him about whether 
he had expected the strong reaction of the Chinese side, what 
had caused the current deadlock in Sino-British relations, and 
whether Patten formulated China policy and had forced the 
British Government to adopt it, or, would he, as Hong Kong 
governor, obey the British Government. Patten still stubbornly 
fought with his back to the wall. He did not dare to speak 
clearly, and just said that "the British Government supports my 
constitutional reform package." It seems that his superiors are 
only able to support a subordinate and do not have the power to 
correct what the subordinate has done. Such an arrogant attitude 
will only arouse strong criticism from the British business 
community. 
  At the hearing, Patten still tried to conceal faults and 
gloss over wrongs and to deceive the British public. He said 
that he did not know about any agreement between China and 
Britain in 1990 at all, because when he consulted Percy Craddock 
about constitutional reforms, Craddock did not tell him that an 
agreement had been reached on electoral arrangements, so he did 
not have to worry about that. All people in Hong Kong have long 
known about the seven letters exchanged between the Chinese and 
British foreign ministers, and Chinese officials also told him 
that the seven letters represented an agreement, but he still 
declared in a session of the Legislation Council's that he 
"would not recognize any secret agreements" and "would not 
create any more secret agreements." The deadlocked situation 
was created by him deliberately, and he is trying to shirk all 
his responsibilities. 
  Now, Western countries, including the United States, Japan, 
Germany, and France, are all vying with each other to march into 
the Chinese market. Will Britain still allow Patten to continue 
his blunders and harm British-Chinese relations? 
  Even the Labor Party's Allan Rogers also said that the 
Conservative cabinet should bear the responsibility for the 
worsening of British-Chinese relations. 
  The parliamentary hearing enabled British voters to clearly 
see who has caused the worsening of British-Chinese relations. 
It is Chris Patten who should bear responsibility for the 
current situation. John Major is now bogged down in a 
predicament, and does not want to be blamed for the worsening of 
British-Chinese relations. Therefore, on the one hand, the 
Conservative Party summoned Patten to give a testimony; on the 
other hand, it has again dispatched McLaren back to Beijing to 
deal the deadlocked situation left to him by Christopher Hum and 
to sound out China's reaction. 
  Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Wu Jianmin explicitly 
replied to the British side: The Chinese side hopes that the 
British side will withdraw the partial constitutional reform 
package that has been submitted to the Hong Kong Legislative 
Council for deliberation and returns to the negotiating table. 
"If the British side refuses to withdraw it and brings the 
second part of the constitutional reform package to the 
Legislative Council for deliberation, then this will further 
show that the British side is determined not to return to the 
negotiating table, and that the British side will thus have to 
bear responsibility for all consequences." "The Chinese side 
will not accept any legislative decision on the 1994-95 
elections made by the Legislative Council, and all institutions 
formed according to such decisions will only be able to function 
up until 30 June 1997." 
  The position of the Chinese side is firm, and the British 
side should carefully weigh up the consequent gains and losses, 
restrain Patten's confrontational policy, and remove obstacles 
to Sino- British cooperation.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`Fairness' Is Being Profaned in London"] </F>
  [Text] Percy Cradock came under heavy fire from Chris 
Patten and his ilk not long ago simply because he said a few 
impartial words on the Hong Kong issue, taking a fair position. 
This has given us much food for thought. 
  The man who launched the attack said: Should Cradock's 
suggestion be adopted, should the British side always act upon 
whatever the Chinese side says, the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration would lose its meaning. 
  Did Cradock ever suggest "acting upon whatever the Chinese 
say?" What "words" and "advice" of the Chinese side did Cradock 
follow? That was Chris Patten's pure fabrication. On the Hong 
Kong constitutional issue, both the Chinese and the British side 
should "follow" the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 
agreements and understanding reached between the Chinese and 
British governments, the plan stipulated in the Sino-British 
Joint Declaration, and the plan settled through negotiations 
between the two sides. That is China's consistent position. 
Should that be "acting upon whatever the other says," that is 
precisely a demonstration of safeguarding the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration as well as Hong Kong's basic interests. 
Nevertheless, Chris Patten has been running in the opposite 
direction, stubbornly pushing his "three-violation" package; he 
just would not listen to the "common understanding" reached 
between the Chinese and British governments, and would not 
follow the "plan" for insuring Hong Hong's prosperity and 
stability and stable transition, which the two sides had agreed 
to. Has not such practice made the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration lose its meaning? 
  The man who launched the attack said: It was entirely wrong 
for Cradock to criticize Chris Patten for refusing to seek the 
Chinese side's advice on the constitutional reform issue; 
although some Chinese officials believed that Chris Patten 
should obtain consent from the Chinese side before presenting 
his constitutional reform package, it did not mean to say that 
the Chinese side had the right to veto any proposal set forth by 
the British side. 
  On the constitutional reform issue, Chris Patten has always 
been unwilling to hear the Chinese side's opinions; upon his 
arrival in Hong Kong, he hastily dished up his "three-violation 
proposal." Would the Chinese side have aired its views and even 
criticized the British side, had Chris Patten not stood in Hong 
Kong, this piece of land that belongs to China, had he made some 
suggestions about British internal affairs instead of some 
principled issue that involves China's sovereignty? It was 
precisely because Chris Patten's proposals have impeded the 
stable transition and injured the basic interest of Hong Kong, 
while harming China's principle of sovereignty, that the Chinese 
have made severe criticism and adopted an attitude of negation. 
Could there be anything wrong in doing this? Would it be right 
to let Chris Patten unscrupulously negate the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration, the principle of converging with the Basic Law, and 
the agreements and understanding already reached between the two 
sides alone, while forbidding others to negate his erroneous 
policies, speeches, and actions that have endangered Hong Kong? 
How could there be such impudent logic in the world? We never 
expected that Chris Patten, who had harped on the same tune on 
resuming talks with the Chinese side, should have constantly 
thumped the table, and ferociously shouted in an occasion of a 
public hearing that "we should never concede to a scoundrel-like 
opponent" in the talks with the Chinese side over constitutional 
reform issues! What a feature of a "gambler" that has gone 
berserk in the game! What an act that showed him up completely! 
  The man who launched the attack said: With what electoral 
arrangements would Cradock reach an agreement? If the Chinese 
side had insisted on implementing a set of electoral 
institutions to reduce the opportunity of democrats being 
elected, should he have kowtowed under such circumstance? 
  That gave away his secrets: The agreement on electoral 
arrangements in Chris Patten's mind aimed to insure the 
"democrats" of his choice to be elected, but not to "reduce the 
opportunity for those democrats being elected." Here, Chris 
Patten misquoted former chief secretary Sir David Akers-Jones as 
saying: "The Chinese style is not to rig elections. But they 
do like to know the result before they're held." Sir David hit 
back at Patten, saying "It was rather a cheap joke." In fact, 
it was none other than Chris Patten himself who attempted to 
"control the elections" and "likes to know the result before the 
elections are held." Actually, he wanted more than knowing the 
result before the elections are held, but was "making 
arrangements beforehand," while masterminding schemes for the 
predetermined body and making helpful arrangements for those 
"democrats" to be elected. The word "kowtow" has been heard 
more often than not; however, its was not Chris Patten's 
invention, but passed on to him by Martin Lee Chu-ming. It is 
not true that Martin Lee Chu-ming has often told Chris Patten 
not to "kowtow" to Beijing? Chris Patten readily took the hint, 
and "followed his advice," in addition, he was lecturing others 
on that point. 
  The man who launched the attack said: Percy Cradock was not 
a Hong Kong resident, and stayed in Hong Kong for a 
comparatively short while; however, he should not have commented 
on what would be good to Hong Kong residents and what not; 
people could not help feeling strange about it. 
  Here, we could pose a string of questions, which we have no 
idea whether or not the man who launched the attack could 
answer. Chris Patten is not a Hong Kong resident; he had never 
stayed very long in Hong Kong before; however, when he first 
came to Hong Kong in 1992, he started criticizing this and 
condemning that, issuing orders right and left; was it not a 
strange thing for him to have done that? In early November last 
year, none of the three lawyers who talked volubly at a 
parliamentary witness hearing early last November were Hong Kong 
residents; probably, they had never been to Hong Kong, or at 
least, had rarely been to Hong Kong; nevertheless, they made 
irresponsible remarks about Hong Kong's constitutional system, 
and were certain that Chris Patten's "constitutional reform 
package" was not a "three-violation" one; whereas Chris Patten 
claimed such remarks to be authoritative; was not that a strange 
thing? We can draw a conclusion without any further questions: 
In the views of Chris Patten and his ilk, whether or not 
something is strange is totally determined by Chris Patten. 
  It's better to say such practice is profanity to "fairness" 
than the attack of Chris Patten and his ilk on Percy Cradock. 
Is it not tragic that such a thing should have happened in a 
self-claimed "democratic" country, and by Chris Patten, who 
personally claimed that he wanted to bestow "fairness" to 
others?! Nevertheless, there are quite a number of parliament 
members in Britain who have challenged Chris Patten by quoting 
Cradock.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Chang Shao-wei (1728 </F>
1421 1218): "Lu Ping Warns That if Chris Patten Tables Second 
Part of Constitutional Reform Package, Sino-British Talks Will 
Break Down Completely"] 
  [Text] Today, Lu Ping, director of the State Council's 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, has said that if Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten brings the second part of his 
constitutional reform package to the Legislative Council, this 
will cause the Sino-British talks to break down completely. 
  He also blamed Patten for violating the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the airport project and delaying the airport's 
construction. 
  Lu Ping arrived in Shenzhen today and joined members of the 
economic group of the Preliminary Working Committee in 
inspecting traffic conditions at the border point in Shenzhen. 
When answering reporters' questions, Lu Ping said that if Hong 
Kong Governor Chris Patten discusses with the British Government 
when to bring the second part of the constitutional reform 
package to the Legislative Council, this would cause talks to 
break down completely and the talks would never be reopened. 
  On the airport issue, he said that Patten had blamed the 
Chinese side for delaying the settlement of the airport issue; 
in fact, the British side should bear all the blame for such a 
delay. As long as the British side returns to the path of the 
Memorandum of Understanding at an early date, the airport issue 
will be solved instantly. Now, the problem is that Patten has 
completely violated the Memorandum of Understanding on the 
airport project, so the blame for the delay can only be put on 
the British side.

on Press Freedom, Stressing That He Actually Puts Pressure on 
Media"] 
  [Text] Responding to Hong Kong Governor Patten's recent 
remarks on freedom of the press in Hong Kong, XINHUA Deputy 
Director Zhang Junsheng said yesterday: "I do not know why 
Patten has been particularly interested in this issue recently. 
You had better ask Patten himself. But, I feel that he himself 
is putting pressure on Hong Kong's media by making such remarks 
now, and I hope he himself will show respect for the freedom of 
the press. Judging from his actual performance, he has put 
pressure on Hong Kong's press circles in various ways." 
  Zhang's remarks were made in answer to a reporter's question 
before he attended the opening ceremony of the "Exhibition of 
Exquisite Chinese Works of Art," which is being co-sponsored by 
Hong Kong's Tsi Ku Chai Company Limited and the Hong Kong and 
Shenzhen Boya Art Company and is being held in the China 
Cultural Relics Gallery yesterday. 
  Zhang Junsheng said: "Some people are now shouting loudly 
for democracy with all their might. In fact, what democracy can 
be obtained here under colonial rule? Actually, there is no 
democracy here, so why do they shout loudly for democracy? Hong 
Kong can only enjoy real and substantive democracy after 1997."

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Chen Zuoer Warns That if British Hong </F>
Kong Authorities Continue To Act Arbitrarily, Consequences Will 
Be Very Serious"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 19 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--Chen Zuoer, director 
of the First Department of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, indicated today that the present messy state of 
the construction of Hong Kong's airport is really worrying. He 
warned that the consequences will be grave if the Hong Kong 
Government continues to act in violation of the principle of 
consultation set out in the Memorandum of Understanding on Hong 
Kong's airport and acts arbitrarily on relevant issues. 
  At a ceremony with the principal executives of the Hong Kong 
airline, Dragonair, who are stationed in Beijing, Chen Zuoer 
responded to the Hong Kong Government's request to the 
Legislative Council to allocate a total HK$1.67 billion [Hong 
Kong dollars] to the Provisional Airport Authority, noting that 
the issue of Hong Kong's new airport should be dealt with in 
accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Hong Kong's 
airport. The construction of Hong Kong's airport could have 
started smoothly following the signing of Memorandum of 
Understanding by the two heads of governments in September 1991. 
"It really makes people worry now that the issue has gotten 
into such a mess. This is the last thing we wish to see." He 
also pointed out that a very important principle had been set 
out in the Memorandum of Understanding that all issues which 
straddle 1997 and which require the government of the future 
special administrative region to acknowledge and shoulder 
responsibility for should be solved through consultations 
between China and Britain. He warned the British Hong Kong 
Government that "its continued arbitrary acts in violation of 
the Memorandum of Understanding will have very grave 
consequences."

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Talks About Airport Issue, Urging </F>
British Side To Go About Things According to Memorandum of 
Understanding"] 
  [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of XINHUA Hong Kong 
Branch, said yesterday that the British side should deal with 
the airport issues in line with the Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU). Otherwise, he added, their is no use in holding a meeting 
of the Airport Committee. 
  After attending a ceremony to raise donations toward a 
school 
building fund under Project Hope, which was held by the Shatin 
Rotary Club yesterday, Zhang was asked to express his view on 
the Hong Kong Government application to the Legislative Council 
(Legco) Finance Committee for the amount of HK$1.6 billion [Hong 
Kong dollars]. In reply, Zhang said the British side is always 
raising obstacles and expressed the hope that the British side 
would act according to the MOU. 
  When commenting on Chris Patten's accusation that the 
Chinese 
side is refusing to hold a meeting, Zhang Junsheng said: The 
British side's programs have always failed to comply with the 
MOU. In that case, what is the use in holding a meeting. The 
British side, as well as Mr. Patten, has repeatedly stressed the 
need to value the interests of Hong Kong people above everything 
else, but they have stirred up so many political disputes and 
now they have refused to tackle the airport issue according to 
the MOU. I believe Hong Kong citizens will judge for themselves 
whether the British side and Mr. Patten have acted in their own 
interests or in the Hong Kong people's interests. 
  When asked whether the two sides had explored the 
possibility 
of resuming talks through diplomatic channels, Zhang responded: 
If the British side should withdraw the partial electoral bill 
submitted to Legco by the Hong Kong governor, it would be 
possible to discuss through diplomatic channels the likelihood 
of resuming talks. But the British side has closed the door 
tight. 
  When asked to comment on the Hong Kong Government's 
allegation that the tabling of the first phase of the 
constitutional reform package in Legco was to prepare for the 
1994/95 elections, Zhang said: That is just an excuse. If the 
British side had sincerity and had not created side issues, the 
two sides would have reached agreement on the district board 
elections in the 17th round of talks. If the British side had 
not insisted on lumping the single- vote, single-seat system for 
Legco elections with the district board elections, an agreement 
would have been reached. The relevant legislation would have 
been easy and there would have been no time problem. So it is 
meaningless for Chris Patten to keep talking nonsense. He 
added: Since the Sino-British talks over the 1994/95 elections 
have broken down, there will be no through train, and the 
three-tier councils will be disbanded after 1997, because 
British rule over Hong Kong will expire on 30 June 1997. The 
British foreign secretary and Chris Patten have said on several 
occasions that it is impossible for China to reorganize the 
councils. That is their illusion. The Preliminary Working 
Committee is now discussing ways to reorganize the councils and 
will present a proposal to the Preparatory Committee of the 
Special Administrative Region for a decision.

<F P=106> [By M.Y. Sung and Rain Ren] </F>
  [Text] The fate of Hong Kong's new airport hangs in the 
balance, with China virtually calling off further talks on the 
project following the government's decision to inject additional 
funds without Beijing's blessing. Xinhua News Agency local 
branch deputy director Zhang Junsheng warned yesterday there was 
little hope of resuming talks on airport financing, because 
Britain had breached Sino-British agreements on financing the 
project. 
  The government will ask legislators tomorrow to approve a 
$1.6 billion cash injection which will give the go-ahead for 
urgent airport contracts, and allow the project to be completed 
by its mid- 1997 target date. China has labelled the move as a 
violation of the Sino-British Memorandum of Understanding on the 
New Airport (MOU), and accused the Hong Kong government of 
taking unilateral action on financing. 
  Mr. Zhang hinted that the Airport Committee (AC) under the 
Sino- British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) was unlikely to resume 
talks on airport financing. 
  "We wish the British side would handle the matter by 
strictly 
abiding by the principles of MOU," Mr. Zhang said. "However, 
the British always play tricks and give trouble in everything." 
  Governor Chris Patten said last week China had not responded 
to calls for further talks through the JLG. But in a 
contradictory statement, a senior Chinese official said China 
had never refused Britain's requests to hold Airport Committee 
talks. "We may not agree to their funding proposal, but we have 
never refused to have meetings," the official said. 
  In her first day as Acting Governor, Anson Chan said the 
government still held out hope that the Airport Committee would 
resume talks. "We hope to continue to have a dialogue with the 
Chinese, to come to an early agreement on the financing so that 
we can get ahead and build this airport that everybody says we 
need," she said. 
  The JLG Airport Committee has not had a meeting since last 
August.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Gan Cheng (3927 2110): "Why </F>
Financing Arrangement for Hong Kong's New Airport Has Become a 
Knotty Issue"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 20 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Hong Kong 
needs a large, modern international airport, and such an airport 
will be conducive to maintaining Hong Kong's position as an 
international financial, economic, trade, communications, and 
transportation center for a long time to come and to make Hong 
Kong, the "Pearl of the East," even more dazzling, stable, and 
prosperous. 
  However, the construction of Hong Kong's new airport has not 
been able to unfold in a comprehensive manner, and the cause is 
that the Chinese and British sides have not been able to reach 
an agreement on the financing arrangements for the airport. 
  The British side did not negotiate with the Chinese side 
from 
the very beginning, but the Chinese side, proceeding from the 
interests of the residents of Hong Kong, has still taken the 
positive attitude of being willing to give support. The heads 
of the Chinese and British governments signed the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the New Airport in Beijing in 1991. The 
memorandum states that the airport project should meet the 
requirement of cost effectiveness, and that the project should 
not become a financial burden for the special administrative 
region [SAR] government after 30 June 1997. It also states that 
on handing over the sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, the 
British side should only leave HK$25 billion [Hong Kong dollars] 
to the government of the Hong Kong SAR and debt incurred should 
not exceed HK$5 billion. If the British side had acted in 
accordance with the Memorandum, the financing arrangement for 
the new airport would not have become a knotty issue. The 
question at present is that the airport financing arrangement 
proposed by the British side greatly exceeds the amount stated 
in the memorandum. The plan involves high costs and low 
effectiveness, and the future Special Administrative Region 
Government is bound to incur much greater debts than HK$5 
billion. This may even exceed the financial reserves of HK$25 
billion. The British side has also insisted on setting no upper 
limit on "contingent liabilities." However, the construction 
costs of the new airport put forward by the Hong Kong Government 
have soared at a shocking speed. In November 1991, the cost of 
construction put forward by the Hong Kong Government was HK$98 
billion, but it was readjusted to HK$112 billion in March 1992. 
Now, some people are saying that the cost of construction has 
been readjusted to HK$150 billion, or even HK$175 billion. How 
can the Chinese side jump lightly into a trap which will 
inevitably cause the SAR government to incur enormous debts! 
  However, the Chinese and British sides have not been able to 
reach an agreement on the financing arrangements, but the Hong 
Kong Government has already started a series of construction 
projects for the new airport. Moreover, the British side has, 
without the agreement of the Chinese side, unilaterally applied 
for funds to be allocated for the airport in the Legislative 
Council on many occasions, and by the end of 1992, an 
accumulated total of over HK$14 billion had been allocated. 
During rigorous inquiries by members of the Legislative 
Council, the Hong Kong Government promised that it would not 
apply for further allocations of funds before reaching an 
agreement on the financing arrangement between the Chinese and 
British sides. However, as those words still rang in the ears, 
the Hong Kong Government recently made an application for the 
allocation of HK$1.67 billion in the Legislative Council again. 
This has increased the total allocated funds to HK$16.26 
billion, which is less than a HK$400-million difference from the 
total amount of HK$16.6 billion promised by the Legislative 
Council to the Provisional Airport Authority in advance. 
Secretary of the Treasury Donald Tsang even stated that the 
possibility of future applications for funds had not been ruled 
out. 
  Evidently, the Hong Kong Government has always been 
enthusiastic about separating the construction of airport 
projects and "putting uncooked rice into the pot first" in an 
attempt to compel the Chinese side to meet the demands of the 
British side on the general financing arrangements for the new 
airport and to swallow the bitter fruit of high costs, low 
effectiveness, and unlimited "contingent liabilities." However, 
the Chinese side has repeatedly reiterated that the issue of the 
financing arrangements for the construction of the airport 
should be settled by the Chinese and British sides through 
negotiations in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding 
on the airport. Before an agreement is reached between the two 
sides, unilateral actions will not be conducive to a solution on 
the financing arrangements for the new airport.

  [Text] An attempt by China to block legislators' approval 
of another $1.67 billion for airport projects appeared to have 
failed last night, with councillors still pledging support for 
construction to proceed full speed without China's blessing. 
The crucial vote will be taken at today's Legislative Council 
Finance Committee meeting. 
  Forty legislators last night vowed to vote for the 
Government's request for cash to cover the Provisional Airport 
Authority's running costs and three urgent airport-related 
contracts to keep up the momentum of construction. The 
legislators include 13 from the United Democrats, 15 from 
Liberal Party, four from the Meeting Point and eight 
independents. 
  They met separately to decide their position last night, 
while China was launching a fresh bout of criticism at Britain's 
handling of the projects in an effort to undermine the 
Government's case for pressing ahead with an attempt to meet the 
completion date of mid- 1997. Director of the Chinese State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, said 
Governor Chris Patten was solely to blame for the delay of the 
airport projects. Mr. Lu and Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu 
Jianmin, insisted that the British Hong Kong administration 
should observe the Memorandum of Understanding on the new 
airport projects. 
  And a lengthy commentary issued by the Hong Kong China News 
Agency last night warned that before any financial accord was 
reached between the two sides, any unilateral action by the 
British side would not be conducive to finding a solution to the 
financing problems. 
  In response, a Government spokesman said: "We are surprised 
to see suggestions that we are breaching the memorandum and 
taking unilateral action." The spokesman stressed that what the 
Government was doing was totally in line with the airport 
memorandum to complete the projects to the maximum extent 
possible by 1997. 
  But in Shenzhen, Mr. Lu blasted the Governor, rejecting Mr. 
Patten's remarks that China was held responsible for the delay 
of the airport plan. "Mr. Patten said that the responsibility 
rested with the Chinese side, it was the Chinese side who 
delayed the projects. Would you please go and tell him that 
Britain is solely responsible for the delay," he said. "The 
airport problem can be resolved immediately, by Britain 
returning to the track of the memorandum as soon as possible. 
The problem now is with Mr. Patten. He is completely violating 
the memorandum. Therefore the responsibility should lie with 
the British side. Please tell him that." 
  In Beijing, Mr. Wu said in compliance with the airport 
memorandum, China had already put forward a whole set of 
proposals for settling the debt burden of the future Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region (SAR), increasing the 
cost-effectiveness of the airport project and intensifying 
necessary supervisory mechanism. Mr. Wu added that China now 
hoped to see a favourable response from the British side.

<F P=106> [Report: "Rising Status of Chinese Capital on Hong Kong </F>
Stock Market"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 17 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION)-- 
Chinese capital is expanding on the Hong Kong stock market. 
Statistics show that by the end of November 1993, the total 
market capitalization of Chinese capital had reached HK$156 
billion [Hong Kong dollars], about 6.02 percent of the total 
market capitalization of HK$2,300 billion. [all figures as 
published] With more and more mainland state-owned enterprises 
listing on the Hong Kong market and the continuous expansion of 
Hong Kong-based Chinese-funded listed companies, the total 
market value of Chinese- funded companies is estimated to 
account for 10 to 15 percent of the Hong Kong stock market's 
total value this year. The situation is heartening. 
  Hong Kong-based Chinese-funded companies with a solid power 
base in the early 1980's were mainly the China Resources Group, 
China Merchant's Steamboat Navigation Company, China Travel 
Service, and the Bank of China Group. In the mid-1980's, the 
Yuehai Group and Huamin Group, under the direct authority of the 
Guangdong and Fujian provincial governments, started trading in 
property, finance, and tourism in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, CITIC 
[China International Trust and Investment Company] and Beijing's 
Everbright Group were also building up business in Hong Kong. 
After years of development in Hong Kong, from the latter half 
of 1992 onward, these big corporations began floating their Hong 
Kong-based subsidiaries to raise more funds for business 
expansion and to enlarge their scale of operation. CITIC 
Pacific was prominent among these companies, becoming a 
composite share of Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index in August 1992. 
  Authoritative figures in Hong Kong economic circles hold 
that 
given the strong force behind Chinese-funded stocks, the growth 
potential for these stocks is enormous and their development 
prospects are considerable.

  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 21 (AFP)--China urged foreign 
reporters in Hong Kong on Friday [21 January] not to show a 
controversial British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC) documentary about 
the life of Chairman Mao Zedong at their club on Monday. But 
the board of governors of the Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC) 
said they would go ahead with Monday's screening of "Mao Zedong: 
The Last Emperor" -- and also ignore an unusual Hong Kong 
government request that they secure a permit for the 
members-only event. 
  FCC Vice President Carl Goldstein said China's demand was 
presented to the board by two officials of the foreign affairs 
department of the Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, 
Beijing's de facto consulate in the British colony. "We have 
come to express our hope -- that is, to make a request that the 
FCC takes measures to stop the showing of this film," Goldstein 
quoted one of the officials as saying. "It villifies and 
slanders our late chairman and hurts the feelings of the Chinese 
people." 
  FCC President Philip Bowring responded that the club's 
decision to organize the screening was not a judgement of the 
documentary's accuracy. Goldstein added that XINHUA was welcome 
to send a representative to the screening to give China's 
opinion. The officials took note of the offer but were 
otherwise non-committal, he said. 
  On Wednesday, the Hong Kong Government's Television and 
Entertainment Licensing Authority got involved, telling the FCC 
by fax that it must get a permit before the showing. It has 
never before made such a demand for FCC film or video 
screenings, and Goldstein said the club would send a letter back 
saying the requirement would be ignored. 
  Ironically, the authority's demand came the same week 
Governor Chris Patten told a US press rights group, the Freedom 
Forum, that his administration would fight "uphill and down 
dale" for press freedoms ahead of Hong Kong's return to China in 
1997. 
  Last month Beijing unsuccessfully put diplomatic pressure on 
London to block the original British telecast of the 
documentary, produced on the centenary of his birth, which 
alleged that in his later years he consorted with young women. 
Sino-British relations are already at a low point over Patten's 
decision to press ahead with electoral reforms aimed at 
extending local democracy ahead of 1997. 
  Hong Kong's biggest television station, Television 
Broadcasts 
Ltd., has acquired rights to the documentary, but has yet to say 
when it will air it. The video was already shown to about 50 
local democracy activists at a private screening last weekend, 
with permission from the television authority.

<F P=106> [By reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 7160)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- In light 
of China's national conditions and the basic requirements of the 
socialist market economic system, Vice President Rong Yiren said 
today that China will continue to adopt the method of advancing 
step by step and gradual transition for the next stage of 
reform. While introducing any reform measure, we will fully 
take into account the bearing capacity of the state and the 
people and ensure that economic development and social stability 
will be promoted through reform. 
  Rong Yiren gave an account of China's reform and opening up 
while meeting today with a Romanian Government delegation led by 
Mircea Cosea, minister of state and chairman of the Council for 
Economy, Coordination, Strategy, and Reforms of Romania. Rong 
stated that development is the target while reform is the motive 
force and political and social stability serve as the guarantee. 
We hope to seek development through reform. When the economy 
has developed, the people's living standards will improve and 
political and social stability will be maintained, which in turn 
will promote reform. This is the experience China has gained 
through reform over the past decade or so. 
  Another important factor of China's economic development 
over 
the past decade is opening up, Rong explained. In a large 
country like China, we must rely on our own efforts. We cannot 
rely on foreign countries for food and clothing. Nevertheless, 
we must implement an open policy and develop economic exchanges 
with other countries, which will be conducive to China's 
economic development. 
  Sharing the same objective of China's, Cosea said, Romania 
is 
also undergoing economic development. Romania wants to develop 
economic exchanges and cooperation with China and hopes that 
China will offer assistance and support for its reform. 
  Cosea and his entourage came to China at the invitation of 
China's State Commission for Restructuring the Economy. They 
will leave for Guangdong, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai tomorrow to 
observe and explore the achievements and experience of China's 
reform and opening up.

  [Text] Bucharest, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Romanian State 
Minister and Economic Reform and Strategy Co-operation Council 
Chairman Mircea Cosea said here today that his two-week visit to 
China was very successful and was of great benefit and 
importance to bilateral relations in the future. 
  Cosea made the remarks to reporters at the Bucharest airport 
upon his return from China. 
  During the visit, he said, his delegation witnessed the 
enormous economic achievements in China and toured the 
fabulously flourishing special economic zones in its part. 
  His delegation exchanged opinions on economic reforms with 
Chinese Government leaders at central and lower levels, Cosea 
said. 
  Besides mutual cooperation in the domain of economic 
reforms, 
his delegation agreed with Chinese officials that Romania and 
China should further advance their economic and trade relations, 
he said. 
  The Romanian Government took interest in developing economic 
relations with China in that China is not only an extremely 
important and stable partner of Romania, but also a huge market 
to exploit, he said. 
  Expressing "double satisfaction" at the outcome of his visit 
to China, he stressed that the new international environment and 
the economic reforms underway in the two countries was in no way 
limiting the development of their relations, but only altered 
the framework for cooperation. 
  Romania should make extensive efforts in search of means of 
furthering Sino-Romanian relations, he said. 
  He added that his delegation returned home very well 
prepared 
on certain questions and that discussions would be held with the 
Ministries of Trade, Industries and Finance so that specific 
ways could be worked out to foster closer economic and trade 
ties with China.

  [Text] The government won't rule out taking the initiative 
to cut its import duty rates before conducting tariff talks with 
member states of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), a top economics official said yesterday. 
  The initiative is expected to put the ROC [Republic of 
China] 
in a better position to negotiate and avoid having -several 
layers of skin peeled off," said Economics Minister Chiang 
Pinkung. 
  Chiang made the remarks before a 17-member Taipei delegation 
left for Washington to discuss temporary tariff cuts on 699 
agricultural and industrial products with U.S. officials. 
  Washington has rejected Taipei's proposal to incorporate the 
talks concerning tariff cuts on 699 items into trade and tariff 
negotiations related to Taipei's bid to rejoin GATT. 
  Accordingly, the tariff cuts on 699 items will be a series 
of 
"unilateral" trade demands by the United States. 
  "It will be like having several layers of our skin peeled 
off," Chiang said. 
  To avoid the unfavorable situation, Chiang said the 
government would time tariff cuts to minimize their impact on 
local industries. 
  During the upcoming tariff talks with Washington, slated for 
Jan. 19-21, the Taipei delegation will relay the government's 
hopes of conducting the annual "bilateral tariff concessions 
talks" as soon as possible, Chiang said. 
  Chiang noted that the government here is unable to fully 
comply with the U.S. request to reduce tariff rates on 514 
industrial products and 185 agricultural items by 50 percent. 
  He said less than 50 industrial items, including cars and 
electrical appliances, will see their tariffs reduced, while 
tariffs on 185 agricultural items would remain unchanged. 
  The Taipei delegation will detail the reasons behind the 
ROC's position to the U.S. negotiators. 
  Heading the delegation is Huang Yenchao, director general of 
the Board of Foreign Trade. His U.S. counterpart is Robert 
Cassidy, an assistant U.S. trade representative. 
  While in Washington, the Taipei delegation is expected to 
face strong U.S. pressure to reduce tariffs on 699 items, as 
relevant U.S. manufacturers and congressmen are urging that the 
U.S. government use its Super 301 provision to force Taipei to 
cut the tariffs. 
  Should Taipei reject the U.S. request, its bid to rejoin 
GATT 
could be affected. Washington officials earlier said the 
progress of Taipei's bid to rejoin the world trade body would 
hinge on Taiwans efforts to reduce tariffs. 
  The government here applies to enter the GATT on Jan. 1, 
1990 
under the title of "Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, 
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu." The application will have to be 
endorsed by at least two thirds of the GATT members, now 
totaling around 110, to be officially accepted. 
  As part of the government's efforts to enter GATT, it has 
decided to cut its weighted average tariff to around 3.5 percent 
from the current level of 4.2 percent.

  [Text] Yesterday, the talks on variable tariff reductions 
between the Republic of China [ROC] and the United States 
completed the agenda for the first day; however, apparently both 
sides have not reached an accord. Our side had proposed to the 
U.S. to try to achieve the objectives through bilateral 
negotiations on tariff cuts related to the ROC's bid to rejoin 
GATT as soon as possible, but the U.S. still prefers to assess 
the situation after the current talks have been completed. 
Please listen to a report by Huang Mei-ping. 
  [Begin recording] [Huang] According to information received 
by the Economic Affairs Ministry from our delegation, 
representatives from both sides to the Sino-U.S. talks had fully 
exchanged their views on tariff reductions in the first day. 
U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Cassidy said: Tariff 
reductions are extremely important to the ROC's accession to 
GATT. At the same time, the ROC has not attained the targets 
set under the four-year tariff reduction plan. This time it has 
proposed taking measures for possible tariff cuts on only 40-odd 
industrial products, but this is still a far cry from U.S. 
demands. 
  Huang Yen-chao, director general of the Board of Foreign 
Trade, stressed to the U.S.: Our side was psychologically 
prepared for tariff concessions; however, variable tariff 
reductions should conform with legal procedures. There are only 
40-50 items that our side can offer for tariff cuts, and it is 
hoped that the other items would be incorporated into ROC-U.S. 
tariff reduction talks relating to the ROC's entry to GATT as 
soon as possible, and that tariff reductions should be effected 
by amending relevant tax regulations through legislation so as 
to be in line with the interests and demands of both sides. The 
U.S. has not specifically responded in this regard, apart from 
saying that it would assess the outcome of the present talks to 
determine whether it would formally enter into GATT talks with 
the ROC. 
  An Economic Affairs Ministry official said that judging from 
the talks on the first day, although nothing specific was 
concluded, representatives from both sides are still working 
hard for an accord. Meanwhile, our delegation is aware of the 
possible formation of the World Trade Organization at an earlier 
date; however, authorities in Taipei have not given any 
instructions to the delegates to negotiate with the U.S. in 
light of this development. 
  This has been a report by China Broadcasting Corporation 
reporter Huang Mei-ping from the Economic Affairs Ministry. [end

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 21 (CNA) -- Tariff consultations 
between the United States and Taiwan ended successfully Friday 
[21 January] despite no concrete agreements being reached, 
according to chief Taiwan negotiator Haung Yen-chao, the 
director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade. 
  Huang said that during the two days of meetings, the U.S. 
negotiators did not press Taiwan to immediately cut tariffs on 
699 farm and industrial products by 50 percent, as they have 
previously requested. 
  The United States may even consider sending officials to 
Taiwan next month for another round of talks on issues related 
to Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT), he noted. 
  The U.S. originally said that it would not talk with Taiwan 
about GATT issues until its tariff-cut request was met. 
  Despite no timetable being set for the tariff reductions, 
Huang insisted the talks were "useful," and said Taiwan "must 
pay some price" sooner or later in order to gain admission to 
GATT. 
  He added that relevant Taiwan government agencies would soon 
start studying the U.S. request. 
  According to customs officials, however, Taiwan is likely to 
cut tariff rates for only part of the industrial imports. As 
for slashing tariffs on the 185 agricultural goods, "that 
possibility has been totally ruled out," the officials said.

  [Text] Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Executive Yuan 
Council for Economic Planning and Development, said on 20 
January that because the time for joining GATT is rather 
pressing, the council will strive to obtain authorization and 
approval from the Legislative Yuan to do so. 
  He also said that to save time, it is hoped that the 
Legislative Yuan will agree to adopt a package of laws when 
enacting laws. 
  He stated that our side has already studied the issue of 
holding negotiations with Communist China over investment and 
direct cross- strait shipping and air ties under GATT. He 
added, however, that there is no need at present to show our 
cards. Hsiao Wan-chang said that administrative departments 
will first have to coordinate with and seek the legislative 
departments' approval to negotiate. However, because the time 
for joining GATT is rather pressing, we cannot expect to 
maintain the pace needed to join GATT if we do not adopt a 
package deal in enacting laws. 
  Administrative departments will also strive to win approval 
from the legislative departments. Hsiao Wan-chang said that 
because the government has already studied ways to deal with the 
issue of holding negotiations on investment and direct 
cross-strait shipping and air ties with Communist China after 
joining GATT, there is no need to wrestle with these problems at 
this point because they will be dealt with after we join GATT.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Ming-yang (2621 0682 2254): "The Fuzzy </F>
Nature of the CPC's Taiwan Policy as Viewed From Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"] 
  [Text] Following the conclusion of the 14th CPC National 
Congress, a leading Hong Kong businessman who is also a member 
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, published a full-page advertisement in 
the party's organ, lauding Deng Xiaoping and describing him as a 
"founder of the `Manifesto of the Communist Party' leading to 
the 21st century" and a "great master of communism who carries 
forward the cause and forges ahead into the future." After 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping was 
published last October, a RENMIN RIBAO editorial said that "the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
founded by Deng Xiaoping is a powerful ideological weapon which 
guides China to become prosperous and strong and is the 
embodiment of Marxism in contemporary China." At the meeting to 
mark the centennial of Mao Zedong's birth, Jiang Zemin pointed 
out that Deng Xiaoping's theory is the "spiritual pillar and 
scientific guide for us to advance triumphantly." All this 
shows that the CPC's worship of Deng Xiaoping today has far 
exceeded its worship of Mao Zedong in the 1960's. 
  As Deng Xiaoping's thought is the pillar and guide for all 
trades, the CPC's approach to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao 
affairs is no exception. In Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, six essays are related to Taiwan. 
1) The main points of Deng's talk with Professor Winston Yang 
of Seton Hall University of New Jersey on 26 June 1983, entitled 
"Ideas About Peaceful Reunification Between the Chinese Mainland 
and Taiwan;" 2) Deng's speech at the third plenary session of 
the CPC Central Advisory Commission on 22 October 1984; 3) the 
main points of Deng's talk with Burmese President U Shan Yu on 
31 October 1984, entitled "The Principle of Peaceful Coexistence 
Has Strong Vitality;" 4) Deng's talk while being interviewed by 
CBS reporter Michael Wallace for the news program "60 Minutes 
Plus" on 2 September 1986; 5) part of Deng's talk with 
Gorbachev, general secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, on 
16 May 1989, entitled "Terminating the Past, Opening Up the 
Future;" and 6) part of Deng's talk with Gwok Hok-nin, a rich 
Chinese businessman from Malaysia, on 15 September 1990, and 
this item is entitled "Making Joint Efforts To Realize the 
Reunification of the Motherland." 
  Deng Xiaoping's instructions on the Taiwan work include 
secret and open instructions. If the instructions are put in 
chronological order people may find that the CPC's Taiwan policy 
was rather inconsistent and elusive, and this showed the 
character of rule of man. 
  On 1 September 1982, Deng Xiaoping pointed out in the 
opening 
speech to the 12th CPC National Congress: "Intensively working 
for socialist modernization, striving for the reunification of 
the whole country, including Taiwan, and opposing hegemonism and 
safeguarding world peace are the three major task for the 
Chinese people in the 1980's." (Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 3) In mid- January 1991, when 
listening to reports by Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, Wang 
Zhaoguo, and Ding Guangan about Taiwan affairs, Deng gave the 
following instruction: "In the period of the Eighth Five- Year 
Plan (between 1991 and 1995), we should consistently carry out 
the three major tasks. The first is to develop the economy; the 
second is to persistently maintain stability; and the third is 
to solve the Taiwan issue. Although these three items were not 
explicitly and completely spelled out in the communique, we 
should keep them in mind. None of the three is dispensable." A 
casual remark uttered by Deng determined that the major tasks of 
the 1980's were extended to the 1990's. 
  Readers who take notice of current affairs may still 
remember 
that, when Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, then-Singapore Prime 
Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who rushed to mourn the death of Chiang, 
predicted that the Republic of China would last for another five 
years only, but three five-year spans have passed, and the 
Republic of China is still standing firm and has the world's 
second largest foreign exchange reserves. 
  When foreign politicians or political commentators commented 
on China's political situation, they often failed to hit home. 
In fact, their erroneous remarks did not matter very much. 
However, being the general architect of mainland China's 
reform, opening, and modernization, the time validity of Deng 
Xiaoping's remarks on resolving the Taiwan issue had to be 
changed quite often, and this seemed rather haphazard. 
  The key to the CPC's Taiwan policy lies in its time 
validity. 
Not only will the 20 million troops and civilians in Taiwan, 
Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu have to worry about this, but the 
American, West European, and Japanese corporations will also 
have to take it seriously. On 16 May 1989, Deng Xiaoping told 
Soviet party and government leader Gorbachev: "In my life, only 
one thing has not been solved. That is the Taiwan issue. It 
seems that I will not be able to see its settlement." Deng was 
85 years that year, and he revealed a sense of helplessness with 
his remarks. These might have been words coming from the bottom 
of his heart. Being a great man, he should be able to know his 
own limitations. 
  However, six months after that, shortly before Deng 
resigned from the chairmanship of the Central Military 
Commission, he told the members of the Political Bureau Standing 
Committee and the principal responsible officials of the Taiwan 
Affairs Office and the United Front Work Department: "The 
settlement of the Taiwan issue cannot be delayed indefinitely. 
The longer this is delayed, the heavier the burdens will 
become! It seems that the Taiwan authorities will never calmly 
sit down to talk. We should make dual preparations. 
Preparations cannot be made only in one aspect! You should 
work out some methods and resolve this issue within five years. 
You should not be able to sleep if this issue is not resolved!" 
He set forth a five-year time limit, and this was related to 
his desire to "live a number of years longer" and to see 
reunification with Taiwan. 
  After the 4 June incident, the CPC maintained that Taiwan 
remained the largest anticommunist base and even condemned the 
Kuomintang for having its hand in creating "turmoil" in the 
mainland. Therefore, the CPC leaders would not be able to set 
their minds at rest as long as the Taiwan issue remained 
unsettled. They had differences over economic issues, but Deng 
Xiaoping, Chen Yun, and Yang Shangkun shared the same opinion on 
Taiwan work. They all considered Li Teng-hui the largest 
champion of Taiwan independence and maintained that the 
separatist forces in Taiwan must not be allowed to succeed and 
that preparations should also be made for using force to solve 
the problem within three to five years. In Beijing alone, the 
cadres engaged in Taiwan work number over 1,000. 
  The anxiousness to realize reunification also found 
expression in Deng Xiaoping's unusual talk with Deng Wen-yi, his 
schoolmate of the same age, on 19 May 1990 (after the 4 June 
incident, he even refused to meet with Japanese Deputy Prime 
Minister Shin Kanemaru and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan 
Yew). Deng Wen-yi was the director of the Political Work 
Department of the National Defense Ministry of the Nanjing 
Government in 1949 when the Communist troops fought across the 
Chang Jiang, and he was also a senior intelligence officer in 
the Kuomintang regime. He lost power in his later years, but he 
was not willing to live in silence. At the invitation of Hou 
Jingru, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, he returned to the mainland to visit 
his old friends and relatives. In Taiwan, he was denounced by 
the Democratic Progressive Party as an "old thief." In the 
mainland, he was treated as an honorable guest of the 
government. The purpose of his mainland visit was to recover 
two houses in Nanjing. Deng Xiaoping took this opportunity to 
brainwash him and said: "Both of us share the same surname, and 
we are also old friends. We can discuss anything except Taiwan 
independence. The CPC and the Kuomintang cooperated very well 
on two occasions in the past, and we can carry out the third 
round of cooperation. In the future, Taiwan and the mainland 
must be reunified. This may take another two or three years. 
At most, reunification will be effected within three years." 
  Deng Xiaoping also told Deng Wen-yi: "We are all people from 
the same family. There should be no war between us, as war is 
unfavorable to both sides. We may discuss this more seriously." 
However, on 10 October of the same year, after watching the 
video tape about Taipei's celebrations of the "Double 10 
Festival," Deng Xiaoping told Yang Shangkun and Ding Guangen: 
"They are still putting on grand airs! Li Teng-hui's words are 
unreliable. They use three hands to deal with us overtly and 
covertly. On one hand, they talk big and utter high-sounding 
words; on the other, they secretly support the Democratic 
Progress Party which seeks Taiwan independence and continue to 
carry out subversive activities against the mainland. Although 
we have already talked too much, they still refuse to accept any 
of our proposals and advice and even regard us as being weak and 
timid!" Then there was the airborne troops' 12 October combat 
exercise on an island with jungles, beaches, and marshlands. 
This was a rehearsal for the attack on Taiwan. 
  On 1 July 1991, Deng Xiaoping told Jiang Zemin and other 
leaders that the Doctors had told him that he would continue to 
be healthy for another eight to 10 years, so it was not as 
urgent to use force against Taiwan. He said: "In the 1980's, 
we planned the first step for realizing reunification. Young 
Chiang died too early, so we did not act in time. Can we now 
make a breakthrough in a period of more than eight years?" He 
added: "If China is not reunified, the people of our generation 
will not be able to close their eyes when they die, and they 
have no face when they see Marx. We hope to use peaceful means 
and solve the issue through negotiations, but we should also 
consider other methods at the same time!" 
  In August of the same year, Deng Xiaoping circled his name 
to 
endorse the Taiwan work program drafted by the State Council's 
Taiwan Affairs Office for the remaining years of this century. 
The program fixed the deadline for settling the Taiwan issue 
around the turn of century. 
  In January 1991, Deng Xiaoping said: "Li Teng-hui is a 
person full of ideas. You should first study him in order to 
discover the right method for dealing with him." Deng Xiaoping 
maintained that Li Teng-hui's statements about one China were 
unreliable. In actual practice, however, the CPC never took Li 
Teng-hui lightly. For example, Wang Daohang, chairman of the 
mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, 
told Huang Chao-sung, editor- in-chief of Taiwan's LIEN HO PAO 
on 14 December 1993: "When formulating the Taiwan policy and 
handling the work related to Taiwan, we took Mr Li Teng-hui as 
our principal counterpart, because he represents Taiwan's ruling 
authorities." 
  To sum up, people may find that the CPC's Taiwan policy has 
always been characterized by the "rule of man" -- it changes 
according to the mood and health of an old man of 90 years. In 
mainland China, where the one-party dictatorship is still in 
force, policies outweigh laws. Policies are the administrative 
guidelines for the state and the party. If the policies are 
inconsistent and elusive, however, they will not be effective. 
The cadres responsible for Taiwan affairs at all levels will 
not know what course to take, nor will the enemies on the other 
side of the straits fear various bluffs and blusters.

<F P=106> [By Lawrence Chung] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, Jan 24 (AFP) -- A pro-democracy Chinese 
dissident who fled China after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, now 
facing repatriation to the mainland, called on Beijing Monday to 
stop persecuting his relatives and friends. 
  "Because of my involvement in the pro-democracy campaign 
almost five years ago, I was branded a rebel, and my relatives 
and friends were spied on and purged," Yin Chin, a former 
journalist, said. "I sincerely hope that China can spare my old 
mother, my wife, my daughter and my friends," he added. 
  Yin, 36, previously a reporter for the Taiyuan Daily News in 
China's Shanxi province, and bureau chief of the Shanxi Economic 
Daily, sneaked into Taiwan in July 1993. He was put into a 
detention home for five months before being transferred to a 
small hostel run by the Free China Relief Association, a group 
dealing with asylum-seekers from China, and is now waiting for a 
foreign government to give him political asylum. The dissident 
could be repatriated if no foreign government agrees to take him 
before the end of this year. 
  Yin told AFP he had been persecuted since June 4, 1989, when 
hundreds of Chinese dissidents were violently crushed by the 
Chinese military in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. "I was 
arrested shortly after the incident and put behind bars for 
three years. After I was released, nobody dared to hire me for 
work. In the end I became a street vendor," Yin said. 
  Yin was arrested in September, 1989 for making speeches 
critical of the Chinese government, including attacking the lack 
of press freedom and democracy in China, and joining public 
protests. He was released in 1992. "I couldn't find any job. 
I was seriously beaten in jail by the wardens and my (right) 
leg was broken," he said, adding that friends later helped him 
escape to Hong Kong in late 1992 to apply for political asylum. 
But the Hong Kong government refused to give him amnesty, and 
sent him back to China, he said, calling the action "inhuman." 
  He said his experience was a typical of hundreds of smaller 
figures in the short-lived pro-democracy movement in China. 
"Many of these people had been turned down by foreign 
governments when they asked for political asylum. A number of 
them hid in the border area of Burma and Thailand, fleeing 
communist pursuit and avoiding arrest by Thai or Burmese 
police," he said. 
  "The Taiwan government does not want to take me either. I 
sneaked into Taiwan last year along with a group of stowaways, 
but was immediately arrested by the coast guard," Yin said. 
"They did not believe I was one of the pro-democracy figures, 
calling me a liar, a beggar....I was beaten and my leg was 
broken again," he said. He said Taiwan's Mainland Affairs 
Council (MAC) later learned of his case and arranged for him to 
stay at the hostel where he was given better treatment. 
  Jackson Chen, an MAC section chief in charge of 
international 
affairs, told AFP the hostel now housed five Chinese dissidents, 
including Yin. "They are applying through local and 
international human rights groups for foreign shelters," he 
said, but added if no foreign governments took them within a 
year, they would be repatriated back to China. 
  He said under Taiwan law, any mainland Chinese sneaking into 
Taiwan was subject to repatriation. "The government here has 
made special consideration for their cases and allows them to 
stay here for one year before repatriation," he said. 
  Hsu Pei-tzu, secretary-general of the Taipei-based Chinese 
Association for Human Rights, said his group was doing all it 
could to help Yin and other dissidents find foreign shelters.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 24 (AFP) -- China this year will 
tighten political and financial controls on movie production, 
China Culture News said in its latest edition received here 
Monday. The government will cut back the number of 
co-productions with foreign firms, ban the creation of joint 
ventures as well as independent Chinese productions, the 
official publication of the Ministry of Culture said. 
  The Chinese press on Monday had still failed to report a 
breakthrough by a Chinese film in the United States -- the 
winning of a Golden Globe Award in Los Angeles on Saturday by 
"Farewell My Concubine," by director Chen Kaige. 
  The film, partly financed by Taiwanese capital, received the 
Golden Palm award at last year's Cannes festival. But, under 
China's censorship laws, it was only screened rarely in China 
and often in a truncated version. 
  "Last year, certain Chinese films were produced with (the 
participation of) Hong Kong and Taiwanese firms which did not 
respect the rules," China Culture News reported. "These films 
do not allow the Chinese cinema to occupy the place it deserves 
on the national market," it said. 
  "This year, we will reduce cooperation abroad and limit the 
number of co-produced films to 26. And we shall ban the 
creation of joint ventures for the production and distribution 
of films." 
  The move comes after two years of relative independence for 
Chinese studios, whose management has gained some financial 
autonomy. The liberalisation has fuelled co-productions with 
foreign companies and also weakened the government's scrutiny 
over content. These developments have helped young, ambitious 
directors to bring their works to the screen but have also drawn 
the wrath of the authorities, who have reacted by censoring the 
movie or hampering its distribution or filming. 
  The government has set a production quota this year of 150 
films for Chinese studios, of which 60 percent must be works of 
contemporary fiction. "The conditions for lifting the 
restraints are not yet right," the ministry of film and 
radio-television, quoted by the China Culture News, said. 
  "The ministry will give production authorisation to 16 state 
studios, no others," it said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 1696 1627): "Jiang </F>
Zemin Will Address National Propaganda Meeting"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 23 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--The national 
propaganda work conference will open tomorrow in Beijing and 
will last for five days. According to the decision of the top 
CPC leadership, the meeting will mainly consider and arrange the 
work of the mass media, including newspapers and journals, 
cultural work, broadcast and television affairs, publishing 
affairs, and overseas propaganda, through further emancipating 
the minds in the course of establishing the socialist market 
economy. 
  According to sources, this will be the second propaganda 
work 
conference that has been undertaken on such a grand scale and at 
such a high level since the founding of the PRC. The previous 
national propaganda work conference was held in 1957. CPC 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin will give a speech at the meeting. 
During the national propaganda work conference, the XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY, journalist and publishing institutions, radio and 
television system, institutions in charge of cultural affairs, 
and the overseas propaganda department will also separately hold 
their own meetings at the same time. 
  The central leadership fully affirmed the orientation of 
opinion in the recent period and said that it was necessary to 
continue to carry out the principle of unity, stability, and 
encouragement, to maintain continuity in propaganda work, and to 
stress the key points in various periods under the new situation 
of building the socialist market economy. This so-called 
continuity refers to the point that the propaganda work as a 
whole should be conducted around the main theme of Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. At the same time, an emphasis should be placed 
on specific key points in various periods.

  [Text] Patriotism is a cornerstone of China's nation 
building, and it also means complete devotion to the Communist 
Party, said patriarch Deng Xiaoping. The remarks by the 
89-year-old senior leader were published in a commentary by the 
People's Daily under the headline of "Three Major Questions 
Concerning the Building of Spiritual Civilisation in a Market 
Economy". The leader said that China's goal of "common 
prosperity" would be doomed to failure if the ruling party 
failed in maintaining the "spiritual purity" of its people and 
combatting negative influence from the capitalist world. 
  The article says that according to the senior leader 
ideological and cultural progress is designed to train a new 
generation of people to have lofty ideals, moral integrity, a 
good education and a high sense of discipline. 
  The newspaper also maintained that a patriot must be loyal 
to 
the Chinese Government led by the Communist Party. "Some people 
say that patriotism does not mean love for the Communist Party," 
the article says. "But Comrade Xiaoping rejected that and asked 
if motherland was an abstract concept. If a person does not 
love the socialist New China under the leadership of the Chinese 
Communist Party, what else can he love?" Mr Deng was quoted as 
asking. 
  In his view, the promotion of patriotism is essential to 
enhancing national self-esteem and self-confidence in the 
current reform and opening of the country to the rest of the 
world. 
  The article quoted the senior leader as attacking artists 
who 
have become increasingly "commercialised" and lost in the 
pursuit of personal wealth. "Ideological and cultural 
departments must produce more spiritual fruits for the people 
and resolutely stop the production, import and circulation of 
poor quality products," Mr Deng said. 
  Although the patriarch retired from all official posts in 
1991. Mr Deng is still regarded as the final decision maker in 
national politics.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 23 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, Standing 
Committee member of the Political Bureau and member of the 
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, gave an important 
speech at the National Conference on Education of Party Members 
this morning. He pointed out: The new situation and tasks 
urgently ask us to further strengthen and improve education of 
party members and raise the standards of the ranks in an 
all-around way. Arming the vast numbers of party members with 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
constitutes the most important improvement in party members' 
education in the new period. Successfully carrying out this task 
will most effectively strengthen party member's education, push 
forward party building in the ideological sphere and in all 
other areas, and provide a stronger guarantee to the success of 
our socialist modernization. 
  Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and Secretariat and secretary of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission, attended the conference. 
  Hu Jintao said: In the course of leading us to blaze the 
path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
begin a new undertaking, particularly in critical junctures, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping has time and again stressed the need to 
build our party well. His thought on building the party in 
power in the new period has greatly enriched and developed 
theories on party building in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong 
Thought. We must earnestly learn and grasp his series of new 
viewpoints, theses, and inventions to guide party building in 
practice. After enumerating Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions 
on strengthening the party's ideological building, improving 
party members' education, and raising their standards, Hu Jintao 
urged comrades involved in party building and party members' 
education to systematically study Comrade Xiaoping's related 
thoughts in his works, profoundly grasp their essence, integrate 
them with the practice of conducting party education in previous 
years, earnestly summarize the experience and lessons, further 
raise their work standards, and more successfully carry out 
their tasks in the future. 
  Hu Jintao stressed: In conducting party members' education, 
we must regard arming the entire party with Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as a fundamental task and use it to help 
accomplish other education tasks. He pointed out: Arming the 
entire party with the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is a fundamental way to strengthen and improve 
party building and raise party members' standards in an 
all-around way. It has a bearing on whether the party's basic 
theory and line will remain unchanged for 100 years and on the 
future and destiny of our party, state, and nation. Party 
organizations at all levels must work hard to carry out this 
great ideological construction project vital to our fundamental 
interests. At present, we must organize party members and 
cadres to study the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" in conjunction with the study and implementation of 
the decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee and direct them to use the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics to guide the practice of 
reform -- accelerating the building of a socialist market 
economy -- and seek tangible results on three issues: 1) 
strengthen the determination and consciousness in building a 
socialist market economic structure and developing a socialist 
market economy, further unify our minds based on the guidelines 
of the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and firmly implement 
the various policy decisions made by the central authorities to 
promote reform; 2) work hard to acquire knowledge about 
developing a socialist market economy, constantly seek to 
improve the ability to operate a socialist market economy, and 
approach problems with new ideas compatible with the 
requirements of building the new economic structure, and try to 
adapt as soon as possible our work methods to the process and 
measures for in-depth reform; 3) consciously step up tempering 
our party spirit in the course of developing a socialist market 
economy, study and work hard to build the new economic 
structure, correctly approach the adjustment of certain 
interests necessary to deepening reform, correctly handle the 
relationship between the overall and partial interests and 
between the collective and the individual, uphold the party's 
ideals and faith, and maintain correct values, integrity, and 
self-discipline to stand the new test in the new period. 
  Hu Jintao said: Over the past several decades, our party 
has accumulated a wealth of experience and developed a number of 
good forms and methods in the education of party members, which 
we undoubtedly should uphold. Meanwhile, we should also note 
that with the in-depth development of reform and opening up, the 
environment and conditions in which party members are today are 
quite different from those in which they used to be. In such 
circumstances, it is not inadequate to only use the past methods 
to educate party members; we must improve such methods and 
concentrate our efforts on the education of party members to 
achieve actual results. He pointed out: First, we should link 
the education of party members closely to the implementation of 
the party's basic line and resolutely make it serve the purposes 
of reform, development, and stability; second, we should 
effectively use the theoretical weapon, have a definite object 
in mind, enhance the purposefulness, persuasion, and appealing 
of education for party members; third, we should link 
strengthening education and settling ideological questions with 
showing concern for party members and solving practical problems 
for them; fourth, we should combine strengthening the education 
of party members with the improvement of management and the 
enforcement of party discipline; and fifth, we should strengthen 
the building of primary party organizations while stepping up 
the education and management of party members. 
  Hu Jintao said in his speech: Party organizations at all 
levels are required to pay close attention to recruiting party 
members from among people, especially from among young people, 
working at the frontlines in production, scientific research, 
and other work. He pointed out: The cause of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics is a cause led by our party with 
the ultimate lofty aim of realization of communism, a cause of 
never ceasing to break new ground in our march into the future. 
This requires unremitting efforts by generation after 
generation of Chinese communists, and it is also necessary for 
us to continuously inject new blood into the body of the party. 
The replacement of new party members for old ones, like the 
replacement of new cadres for old ones, is an organizational 
guarantee for unswervingly upholding the party's basic line for 
a hundred years and a prerequisite for ensuring that there is no 
lack of successors to carry on the party's cause and that the 
party's cause will thrive. Proceeding from reality, party 
organizations at various levels should analyze new conditions 
for recruiting party members and seek ways and methods to solve 
new problems. In recruiting party members, it is essential to 
uphold the criteria for party members as stipulated in the party 
constitution and to ensure that new party members are qualified. 
  Hu Jintao hoped that party committees at various levels 
would 
take the lead in implementing the principle of "the party 
handling party affairs" and strengthen and improve their 
leadership over the education of party members. They should 
improve their leadership methods, change their work styles, and 
strengthen their marco- guidance and specific supervision and 
inspection; they should step up investigation and study and 
conscientiously analyze the new changes brought about through 
the establishment of a socialist market economy in the values, 
thinking, feelings, and mentality of party members; they should 
often sum up and popularize effective methods developed by 
basic-level party organizations in the education of party 
members; and they should accumulate experiences in practice and 
gradually grasp the laws of educating party members in the new 
situation to perform this work efficiently. 
  Lu Feng, director of the party Central Committee 
Organization 
Department, chaired today's meeting. Leaders of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission and relevant departments under 
the party Central Committee attended the meeting, including Hou 
Zongbin, Song Defu, Zhao Zongnai, Xu Weicheng, Wang Jialiu, and 
Chen Fujin. Also present at today's meeting were party committee 
secretaries of various departments under the party Central 
Committee and the State Council.

  [Text] Beijing, January 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese leader Li 
Ruihuan said here today it is necessary to integrate theory with 
practice, pay attention to investigating into new problems and 
sum up new experience in studying the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Li, who is a member of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of China (CPC) and chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made these 
remarks at a ceremony this afternoon to mark the completion of a 
theoretical course attended by leading members of some 
non-communist parties and All- China Federation of Industry and 
Commerce as well as some personages without any party 
affiliation. 
  Noting that building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
has become the most important common ground of the Chinese 
people, Li said that only by recognizing and adhering to the 
common ground can the united front have its soul and keep 
consolidating and expanding. 
  He acknowledged that Deng Xiaoping's exposition on the 
united 
front during the new period is an important component part of 
the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
and it is significance to guiding the Communist Party to do 
still better the work concerning the united front in the new 
period. 
  Li stressed that to study the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics is aimed at grasping the powerful 
weapon to solve the real problems that crop up in reform, 
opening up and modernization drive. 
  He said that to study the new situation and sum up new 
experience under the guidance of the theory is needed by the 
present work and also constitutes an important way of applying 
the theory to reality. 
  At present, Li said, the Chinese people is working hard to 
establish a socialist market economy, which is a big system 
engineering project. During the process, he added, it is 
essential to delve into the emerging problems and promptly sum 
up the experience under the guidance of the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  The ceremony was presided over by Hu Jintao, a member of the 
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee and president of the Central Party School. Leading 
members of the country's non-communist parties and some 
personages without party affiliation were present at the 
ceremony.

<F P=106> [By Xing Zhimin (1630 2535 2404): "Comrade Yang Shangkun </F>
Inspects Shenzhen"] 
  [Text] Former state president Yang Shangkun recently 
inspected Shenzhen. 
  On the afternoon of 20 January, when strong icy winds were 
blowing on a very cold day, Comrade Yang Shangkun came to the 
city government building. He wore a gray overcoat and walked 
with firm steps. He smiled and shook hands with people in the 
welcome crowd one by one and then talked cordially with the 
Shenzhen City leaders. 
  Comrade Yang Shangkun said: I have special feelings toward 
Shenzhen. When Comrade Xi Zhongxun and I worked in the 
Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, the central authorities 
decided to adopt special policies in Guangdong. In particular, 
after the establishment of the special economic zones, they 
played a great role in leading and promoting reform and opening 
up. I have visited the special zones often since then. In 
general, I found that there were changes every year in Shenzhen. 
Last year, from the Shenzhen Airport to Zhuhai via Shekou, I 
saw large stretches of empty land along the roadside, but, this 
year, new buildings have cropped up there, and the road has also 
been improved. I am really glad to see all this. 
  Making a gesture, he said: The city party committee has just 
held a meeting to decide the principles and policies for future 
development, and this is very good. Yesterday, I read an 
interview with Comrade Liu Tianfu in SHENZHEN TEQU BAO. He 
hoped that Shenzhen would make further progress. This is also 
the common hope of all of us old comrades. This year, the state 
will adopt many major reform measures and the pace of reform 
will be quickened, meaning that the tasks will be pressing and 
will cover a broad scope. Efforts should be made to deal with 
new issues and overcome new difficulties. New experience should 
be summed up. Reform, opening, and economic construction in the 
special economic zones should be carried out positively and 
prudently. Last year, Shenzhen experienced fires and floods, 
but you nevertheless have made great achievements in your work. 
Comrades, you should make greater efforts this year, continue 
to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and do a better 
job than last year. 
  Comrade Yang Shangkun particularly appreciated the 
appearance 
of a large number of competent young cadres in Shenzhen. He 
said that he had come into contact with some cadres in Shenzhen, 
including some entrepreneurs. They are all quite young -- some 
are just in their thirties. This shows that our cause has no 
lack of successors and is full of bright hopes. 
  Li Youwei said: Two years ago today, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
was inspecting Shenzhen and made some important speeches. At 
that time, Comrade Yang Shangkun was also in Shenzhen to help 
promote our country's further reform and opening. Today, after 
an interval of two years, Comrade Yang Shangkun has once again 
inspected Shenzhen. This gave great encouragement and support 
to the special economic zone. He said that the people in 
Shenzhen would never let down the proletarian revolutionaries of 
the old generation and would certainly build the special 
economic zone into a more beautiful place. 
  Li Youwei extended a new year greeting to Comrade Yang 
Shangkun on behalf of the entire people in Shenzhen and wished 
him good health. 
  On the morning of 21 January, Wang Zhongfu and other 
principal city leaders once again reported their work to Comrade 
Yang Shangkun. 
  Comrade Yang Shangkun arrived in Shenzhen by special plane 
from Beijing on the morning of 8 January. Huang Huahua, Fu Rui, 
and Li Youwei met him at the airport. 
  On the morning of 12 January, accompanied by Wang Zhongfu, 
Comrade Yang Shangkun, full of zest, visited the wild animal zoo 
in Shenzhen. That afternoon, Xie Fei, secretary of the 
Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, particularly came to see 
Comrade Yang Shangkun. On the morning of 16 January, 
accompanied by Yuan Geng, Comrade Yang Shangkun inspected 
Shekou. On the morning of 17 January, accompanied by Li Youwei 
and Li Po, Comrade Yang Shangkun, full of zest, visited 
Shenzhen's Golf Club. 
  In Shenzhen, Comrade Yang Shangkun also paid special 
attention to the development of the high-tech industries. On 
the morning of 19 January, accompanied by Huang Liman, he 
inspected two high-tech companies, Anke and Huawei, and 
expressed satisfaction with the remarkable achievements and 
technological breakthroughs made by these two companies in the 
fields of sophisticated medical equipment and programmable 
digital telephone exchanges. In Anke, Comrade Yang Shangkun 
wrote: "Developing high technology, promoting the new 
development of the national economy." On the morning of 20 
January, being accompanied by Yang Guanghui, he inspected the 
Kaifa Science and Technology Company. There, he inquired about 
the details of the production process and encouraged the company 
to make new progress in the new year. 
  Yesterday, Comrade Yang Shangkun finished his inspection and 
left Shenzhen.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" from Shenzhen: "Yang Shangkun Ends His </F>
Inspection Tour in Shenzhen and Urges the Active and Prudent 
Promotion of Reform"] 
  [Text] Shenzhen, 23 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--Former State 
President Yang Shangkun arrived in Shenzhen from Beijing by 
special plane on the morning of 8 January. He left Shenzhen 
yesterday, 22 January, after a half-month inspection tour here. 
  Two years ago, from 20 to 22 January, Yang Shangkun, then 
state president, made an inspection tour in the same city. 
During that visit, he toured Xianhu Botanical Garden on the 
western slope of the Wutong Shan in the northeastern outskirts 
of Shenzhen on 22 January with Deng Xiaoping, who at that time 
happened to be in Shenzhen on his south China tour. The two 
visitors planted two banyans at the botanical garden before they 
left. At that time, many Hong Kong reporters came to Shenzhen 
from the other side of the border to cover their inspection tour 
here. Deng Xiaoping made some remarks in Shenzhen during that 
visit. He said that "it is necessary to blaze new trails" and 
"to speed up the pace a little bit," and that "China will have 
no way out but to carry on with reform." Later on, these 
remarks initiated a great tide of deepening reform and expanding 
opening-up nationwide. The two banyans that Deng Xiaoping and 
Yang Shangkun planted at the Xianhu Botanical Garden have 
attracted more than 1.3 million visitors over the past two 
years, many of whom have pictures taken beside the trees. 
  The timing of Yang Shangkun's revisit to Shenzhen has 
aroused 
much speculation that Deng Xiaoping may do the same. 
Furthermore, at this moment the mass media in Shenzhen by and 
large are publishing pictures and reminiscences of Deng 
Xiaoping's last visit to Shenzhen. The huge painting of Deng 
Xiaoping erected at Lizhi Park is now being repainted, and this 
has drawn even more concern from the public. 
  Yang Shangkun's arrival in Shenzhen on 8 January was not 
covered by the local press. The mass media have not reported on 
Yang Shangkun's activities in the city until today: On the 
morning of 12 January, he toured the Shenzhen Wildlife Zoo in 
the company of Wang Zhongfu and then met with Guangdong 
Provincial Party Committee Secretary Xie Fei that afternoon. On 
the morning of 16 January, he had an inspection tour of Shekou 
in the company of Yuan Geng, and on the morning of 17 January, 
he visited the Shenzhen Golf Club in the company of Li Youwei 
and Li Hao. On the morning of 19 January, he visited two 
high-tech companies -- Anke and Huawei -- in the company of 
Huang Liman and, on the morning of 20 January, he visited the 
Kaifa Science and Technology Company accompanied by Yang 
Guanghui. On the afternoon of 20 January, he joined the 
officials in charge of Shenzhen city in a forum held at the 
Shenzhen City Government Complex. On the morning of 21 January, 
he heard another briefing on government work by Wang Zhongfu, 
the principal official in charge of Shenzhen city, and then 
wound up his inspection tour and left Shenzhen on 22 January. 
  This time, Yang Shangkun had a fairly long stay in Shenzhen 
and visited quite a few places. He told Shenzhen's leading 
officials that he had special feelings for the city. At the 
time when the central authorities decided to introduce a special 
policy into Guangdong, he was working with the Guangdong 
Provincial Party Committee. From that time on, he visited the 
special economic zone [SEZ] from time to time. His general 
impression is that Shenzhen has changed every year, and the city 
has undergone still greater changes this year. He hoped that 
Shenzhen will make more progress. This year, the state has 
introduced many major reform measures which call for rapid 
progress to be achieved within a short time and which cover a 
wide range of fields. One will need to study new issues, 
overcome new difficulties, sum up new experiences, and actively 
and prudently push ahead reform, opening up, and economic 
construction in the SEZ. 
  Shenzhen City Mayor Li Youwei thanked Yang Shangkun for his 
concern and support for the Shenzhen SEZ. Li said that the 
Shenzhen people will live up to the high hopes of the 
revolutionaries of the older generation and build the Shenzhen 
SEZ into a still better city.

  [Text] Beijing, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing said recently that industrialization of new and high 
technology will not only produce better economic results and 
social efficiency at present, but also lay a solid foundation 
for economic development in the future. 
  In his recent visit to the Beijing New Technology 
Development 
and Experiment Zone, he said that the zone is a far-sighted 
project. He added that, in the initial stage of its 
development, the zone has made remarkable progress. 
  He said that in the past four decades, a great number of 
technological achievements turned out in the educational and 
scientific fields have failed to find practical application. 
  He said that the industrialization of high technology is one 
of the effective ways for turning technology into production 
force. 
  He said that the experiment zone should enhance the training 
of personnel in the sectors of international trade, finance, law 
and accounting. 
  He noted that the talents in the above sectors are now badly 
needed for the establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure in the country. 
  He urged the Chinese inventors to timely apply for patent 
rights at home and abroad so as to strengthen their competitive 
strength in making use of scientific and technological 
achievements. 
  Located in the Zhongguancun district, the experiment zone 
was 
China's first new and high technology development park. 
  Over the past five years, 112 high-technology enterprises in 
the zone have achieved an annual income exceeding 10 million 
yuan each. 
  Last year, the total income of the zone exceeded more than 
10 
billion yuan.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice- 
Premier Zou Jiahua has urged provinces and municipalities in the 
coastal area of the Bohai Sea in north China, and relevant 
departments, to liaise with one another to promote the economic 
development of the area. 
  Zou made the remarks at a symposium on economic planning of 
the coastal area of the Bohai Sea, which was held in Tangshan 
city of Hebei Province from January 17 to 19. 
  This was the country's fourth symposium on regional economic 
planning. In 1992 and 1993, symposiums on economic planning of 
the region covering southwest China and part of south China, the 
Chang Jiang river delta and the riparian region and the 
northwest-China region were held. 
  Vice-Premier Zou pointed out that as a focal point of the 
northeast Asian economic sphere and an outlet of north China, 
northeast China and northwest China towards the Pacific Ocean, 
the region around the Bohai Sea has many advantages. 
  He said that the region ranks first in research forces. The 
number of higher education establishments and research and 
technical personnel in the region accounts for one third of the 
national total. 
  Besides, the output of coal, crude oil and iron and steel of 
the region all account for 40 percent of the national total 
respectively. The region is both China's political and economic 
center. To accelerate the economic development of the region 
has a strategic significance for the development of the national 
economy. 
  Zou listed the following focal points of the program for the 
development of the region: 
  -- To build a network of telecommunications covering all 
parts of China, with Beijing as the center, and a network of 
communications concentrating on transport of coal and 
commodities for export; 
  -- To cooperate to open up more natural resources in the 
region and develop the industry of raw materials; 
  -- To establish a unified regional and open market to make 
better use of natural resources; 
  -- To make efforts to solve the problem of water shortages 
in 
the region through quickening construction of the projects aimed 
at diverting water from the southern part of the country to the

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice- 
Premier Zou Jiahua urged industrial enterprises to keep up with 
the development of new technologies at home and abroad and 
improve their technical standards. 
  Zou made the remark during an investigation tour of Tangshan 
City in north China's Hebei Province from January 16 to 20. 
  Accompanied by local leaders, Zou visited Jingtang Harbor, 
the harbor development zone, the Tangshan Iron and Steel 
Company, the Douhe power plant and the Jidong cement plant. 
  While visiting the expansion project of the Tangshan Iron 
and 
Steel Company, Zou said the development of an enterprise must be 
based on technical progress. 
  "Technical upgrading should be carried out every year, 
especially from the aspect of using new technologies and 
developing new products," Zou said. 
  He pointed out that the worth of an enterprise should be 
decided not by its output merely, but by its efficiency and 
technical level.

<F P=106> ["Dispatch" by reporter Yu Qingchu (0151 3237 5710): "Over </F>
1,900 Party Members and Cadres in Jiangxi Have Been Punished for 
Corruption"] 
  [Text] Jiangxi Province has made breakthroughs in 
promoting the building of a clean and honest administration and 
its economic construction through the handling of major and 
important cases of corruption by relying on the broad ranks of 
cadres and the broad masses. So far, the discipline inspection, 
supervision, and procuratorial organs throughout the province 
have filed 2,648 cases, have punished 1,962 party members and 
cadres, and have handled a whole series of major and important 
cases. Direct financial losses to the state of over 20 million 
yuan were prevented. 
  Since last August, the authorities in Jiangxi Province have 
continuously strengthened the anticorruption operation; have 
reinforced the organization and system for enforcing discipline, 
enforcing the law, and handling cases; have reannounced a batch 
of complaint hotlines; and have set up complaint boxes in 
downtown areas and at major communication hubs. These measures 
have aroused the masses' enthusiasm for reporting offenses. The 
provincial discipline inspection, supervision, and procuratorial 
organs alone have received approximately 10,000 petition letters 
and verbal complaints. 
  The authorities in Jiangxi Province have consistently 
conducted the anticorruption campaign by focusing on the conduct 
of leading cadres first and giving priority to precautionary 
education and prevention. A group of party members and cadres 
have been educated and redeemed through self-examination and 
self-correction. The phenomenon of leaders attending to the 
anticorruption operation in person, leaders becoming the object 
of the anticorruption operation, and leaders taking the lead in 
self-examination, self-correction, and showing self-discipline 
and honesty in performing official duties prevailed throughout 
the province. Leading cadres ranking at and above the level of 
county head or provincial department head all checked their own 
conduct and strictly disciplined themselves by attending 
criticism and self-criticism meetings and filling out checklists 
in accordance with the five stipulations laid down by the 
Central Committee and the seven requirements raised by the 
provincial party committee. So far, 1,223 cadres have returned 
or handed in gift money and valuable securities which they 
received through official activities and 534 have resigned from 
their part- time positions in various kinds of economic entities. 
  Seeking breakthroughs in promoting the building of a clean 
and honest administration by handling major and important cases 
of corruption is a distinctive hallmark of Jiangxi's 
anticorruption operation. The provincial discipline inspection 
and supervision organs have handled 17 cadres ranking at and 
above the level of county head, and the provincial procuratorial 
organs have handled 488 major cases and 42 important ones.

  [Excerpts] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- The CPC Central 
Committee Discipline Inspection Commission issued a circular on 
30 December 1993 transmitting a notice from the Hebei Provincial 
CPC Committee Discipline Inspection Commission concerning 
mistakes made by Liu Qingfang, former secretary of the Lingshou 
County party committee. The circular urges all localities and 
departments, in conjunction with the current anticorruption 
drive, to use the case of Liu Qingfang's expulsion from the 
party on account of his mistakes in accepting gift money and 
using it for his mother's ostentatious funeral, to conduct 
education in party style and discipline among the large numbers 
of party members and cadres, and to enhance their party spirit 
and awareness, and their sense of organizational discipline, 
integrity, and self-discipline. 
  The circular says: The expulsion of Liu Qingfang, a leading 
county cadre, from the party for serious violation of 
discipline, has once again admonished us that: 1) Communist 
party members, and leading cadres at all levels in particular, 
must constantly temper their party spirit, adhere to the 
proletarian outlook on life and sense of value, constantly bear 
in mind the party's objective of serving the people 
wholeheartedly, be strict with themselves, and honestly perform 
their duties. Only by doing so can they stand the tests of 
governing, reform, and opening up; and forever retain political 
integrity. 2) The party's leading cadres at all levels must set 
an example in maintaining integrity and self-discipline. The 
case of Liu Qingfang and other cases of violation of law and 
discipline show that failure in self-discipline often leads to 
corruption. Corruption, if unchecked, not only harms the 
culprits themselves but also corrupts the party and blemishes 
its image. It will also bring calamity to the country and the 
people, and sow the seeds of trouble in the future if it is 
allowed to spread. Therefore, leading cadres must take the lead 
in maintaining integrity and self-discipline and guard against 
becoming greedy, abusing power, trading power for money, and 
using their position for personal gain. This is an essential 
requirement and important safeguard in consolidating the party's 
ruling status, developing the economy, promoting reform, and 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party 
organizations and leading cadres at all levels must be clearly 
aware of this. 3) Leading cadres must earnestly practice what 
they advocate, and they must promote new social ethics. Our 
party has time and again stressed that socialism with Chinese 
characteristics incorporates both material and spiritual 
civilizations. An important responsibility of all leading 
cadres is to work hard to build socialist spiritual 
civilization; foster new social ethics; break away from corrupt 
customs; and firmly resist the inroads of capitalist and 
feudalist ideas in the course of promoting economic 
construction. In the new situation of reform and opening up and 
vigorous development of a socialist market economy, the vast 
numbers of party members and cadres should not only maintain 
integrity and self-discipline but should also take the lead in 
promoting healthy practices and eliminating evil practices. They 
should correctly guide and lead the broad masses in fostering 
new social ethics and improving local atmosphere to create a 
favorable social environment for reform, opening, and economic 
construction. 
  The CPC Central Committee Discipline Inspection Commission 
transmitted the notice issued by the Hebei provincial party 
committee Discipline Inspection Commission on the mistakes made 
by the former Lingshou County secretary, Liu Qingfang. [passage 
omitted] 
  The notice issued by the Hebei provincial party committee 
discipline inspection commission points out: As a leading party 
cadre, Liu Qingfang should have observed party discipline and 
maintained integrity in an exemplary way. Instead, to hold a 
funeral ceremony for his mother in an extravagant way, he 
accepted gifts of large amounts of money, used his position to 
take bribes, and infringed on the economic interests of the 
state and collective. His acts seriously violated party 
discipline and created a very bad influence among the masses. 
In light of this, the Hebei provincial party committee has 
decided to expel him from the party.

  [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Zhang 
Siqing, procurator general of the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, recently revealed that in mainland China most of 
the criminal offenders involved in corruption cases are those 
who are in charge of affairs related to money, while most who 
receive bribes are those who hold the power of disposing human, 
financial, and material resources, in particular those who have 
direct access to certain specific powers. 
  Zhang Siqing said criminal cases nowadays involve 
increasingly large amounts of money, and the number of major and 
extraordinarily serious cases are multiplying. From January to 
September 1993, cases involving more than 10,000 yuan each that 
procuratorial organs placed on file for investigations accounted 
for 60 percent of all cases placed on file during that period; 
and 77 cases of corruption and bribery involved over 500,000 
yuan. Hence the numbers of these two categories of cases are 
double and triple the figures for the same period of 1992 
respectively. 
  In terms of sectors of origin, more cases took place in 
monopolized sectors, such as the sectors of banking, railway 
transport, capital construction, and land project examination 
and approval. Hot-spot economic construction sectors, including 
the negotiable securities, stock, and real estate markets, have 
seen some new forms of criminal offense. The number of 
collective crimes has increased, with a remarkable increase in 
the number of cases involving collaboration between both those 
from within and without an organization, between people from 
different trades, and from different areas. 
  Cases of graft and bribery occur frequently in localities 
and 
departments seriously suffering from evil trends and, very 
often, a single case taken up by a procuratorial organ may 
expose a series of new cases. The nature of cases can be a 
mixture of graft and bribery, smuggling, tax evasion, favoritism 
and cheating, dereliction of duty, harboring of evildoers and 
covering up of evil deeds, forgery of documents, and so on, and 
it is pretty common that a single case involves several crimes 
and many persons, or a single crime involves many offenders.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ma Chenguang: "Public Tips Help Bring </F>
the Corrupt to Court"] 
  [Text] More than 60,000 people were charged with 
corruption last year, a senior official said yesterday. 
  And 80 percent were turned in by the public. 
  Fifty-four percent of the cases involved bribery and 24 
percent involved embezzlement, said Yang Shen of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission (CDIC). 
  Nationwide, procuratorial organs handled 525,570 cases 
during 
the first 11 months of last year involving 60,163 offenders, 
said Yang, who is director of the CDIC's Letters-and-Visits 
Reception Office. 
  Phone calls, letters and visits from the public helped the 
government uncover more than 80 percent of the corruption cases. 
  So far, more than 10,000 offenders have been brought to 
trial 
or face trials, Yang said. 
  Last August, the country tightened its rein on corrupt 
activities, which run from taking bribes and gifts to embezzling 
public funds for private purposes. 
  During the past year, the crime-reporting centre under the 
Supreme People's Procuratorate received more than 270,000 
reports about illegal activities, 58 of which involved bribery 
and embezzlement. 
  The CDIC and the Ministry of Supervision, the country's two 
main supervisory organs, received 100,678 tips from people 
nationwide through calls, letters and visits. 
  Only 2 percent of the reports were fabricated. 
  To date, 194 big cases have been filed, with all offenders 
either having been tried or waiting for trial. 
  The complaint centre at the Ministry of Public Security also 
received 2,595 tips from the public. 
  According to Yang, among the reported cases at his CDIC 
office last year, more than 20 per cent were concerned with 
embezzlement and financial infractions. 
  Most offenders held bureau-director level positions and were 
from developing regions such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Guizhou 
and Yunnan provinces. 
  Yang said this was because policies and administrative 
mechanisms in these areas still have loopholes as the country 
becomes a socialist market economy. 
  He said the Party and the State have strongly encouraged 
people to report graft during the nation's anti-corruption drive. 
  Nationwide supervisory organs have set up 
"letters-and-visits" offices, hotlines and complaint boxes to 
make it easier for people to report corruption. 
  And to encourage people to do so, Yang said, special 
campaigns have also been conducted to make it easier to report 
crime. Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has run 
campaigns to stop corruption against farmers, end 
government-financed trips abroad and ban extravagant marriage 
and burial ceremonies.

<F P=106> [By special reporter Leng Mou (0397 4188)] </F>
  [Text] China's comprehensive reform will mainly be carried 
out in cities and towns this year. The ability of the large 
numbers of workers in cities and towns, especially low-income 
and retired workers, to withstand the effects of reform will 
have direct influence on the outcome of this carefully designed 
plan. Associate Professor Feng Tongqing of the China Worker 
Movement Institute in Beijing, who has long been engaged in the 
study of workers' mentality, pointed out that when carrying out 
reform, one must taken into account economic compensation and 
welfare assurance for workers in the lower income bracket, and 
one should never overestimate the workers' capacity to withstand 
the effects of reform. 
  In recent years, poor coordination between a series of 
reform 
projects launched in mainland China has resulted in an increase 
in the living expenses of worker households and relatively 
insufficient compensation in terms of actual income. Feng 
Tongqing believes that a reform plan which keeps the workers' 
"net burden" at the level of about 5 percent of their income 
will, generally speaking, be more readily acceptable to most 
workers. But, while raising pay, it is still necessary to 
introduce a full range of reforms regarding the insurance, 
housing, price, and welfare systems, so as to keep a basic 
balance between pay rises and the due price for introducing the 
reforms in the areas of insurance, housing, price, and welfare. 
  Anyway, the reform package will possibly cause a chain 
reaction in commodity prices, as excessive price hikes will 
possibly be intolerable to the workers. What is more, price 
increases caused by an increase in labor costs usually ends up 
the cost transfer process with enterprises paying the price in 
the form of losses. Also, as reform may advance faster, thus 
imposing heavier a burden on workers during a certain period, 
the pressure on some low-income worker households may exceed the 
limit they can withstand. Feng noted that the limit of "net 
burden" that the workers can withstand should be scientifically 
estimated so that it can be kept within a certain range without 
causing any fluctuation in the workers' daily economic life. 
  Associate Professor Feng Tongqing participated in the 
discussions, forecasts, and analysis that resulted in the blue 
paper: "An Analysis and Forecast of Social Conditions in China 
(1993-1994)." He emphasized that relative grievances among low- 
income workers, fluctuation in the workers' daily economic life, 
and the intensifying conflicts between workers and management 
may all contribute to more frequent occurrences of 
"eventualities." The so- called "eventualities," he explained, 
are collective actions taken by a certain number of workers 
(more than 10 people), in the form of strikes, collective 
slowdowns, collective visits to government departments to lodge 
complaints, assemblies, sit-ins, and so on. 
  Statistics by the letter and visit bureaus of the CPC 
Central 
Committee General Office and of the State Council show that the 
number of visiting groups and individual visitors received by 
the two bureaus from January to May last year increased by 31 
and 29.8 percent over the corresponding period in 1992. Of the 
cases raised during these visits, 28 percent were to complain 
about some issues related to daily economic life. Meanwhile, as 
shown by incomplete statistics made among enterprises in 10 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under 
the central government, the number of eventualities that took 
place in the second quarter of 1993 was 83.9 percent higher than 
the figure in the corresponding period in 1992. 
  Feng Tongqing said: Intensifying conflicts between 
management and workers is a basic cause for eventualities. The 
workers have grievances against reforms within their 
enterprises, especially against some enterprises' practice of 
"three changes and three no- changes" regarding the redundant 
manpower layoff operation; specifically, the practice of 
changing workers but not changing cadres; changing first-line 
employees (that is, producers) but not changing second- and 
third-line staff (that is, administrators); and change on 
general issues but no change on deep-rooted issues. Feng 
Tongqing held that it is necessary to quickly establish a 
tripartite mechanism which enables the trade unions and 
enterprises to open talks, with the government as a mediator, so 
that the labor disputes can be put on a normal basis. Only in 
this way will it be possible to substantially reduce 
eventualities. 
  The knotty problem of personnel reemployment has long been 
disturbing enterprises. This problem has not only dampened 
workers' initiative, but it is also the basic reason why the 
standing of workers in state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises has been further downgraded. An estimate shows that 
at the moment enterprises in mainland China have some 17 million 
redundant personnel, of whom about 10 million are working with 
state-owned enterprises. Statistics released by the labor 
department indicate that some 200,000 of the 1 million personnel 
laid off from enterprises still remain jobless. According to 
the plan by the government department concerned, the 
re-employment of redundant personnel of enterprises will not be 
properly solved until 2000. 
  Therefore, Feng Tongqing said the standing of workers of 
state- owned enterprises is expected to be further downgraded in 
1994.

  [Text] A provincial rural work conference wound up in 
Lanzhou yesterday. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang delivered 
at 
the conference an important speech in which he stated: As we 
are to make a bigger stride forward in respect of reform in 
1994, Gansu is expected to confront a rigorous challenge in 
building a market economy. In view of this situation, party 
committees at all levels in Gansu should make a correct analysis 
and acquire a clear understanding of the province's rural 
situation, unswervingly give top priority to agriculture in the 
province's overall economic work, mobilize and protect the 
enthusiasm of peasants, push ahead with in- depth rural reform, 
implement rural policies to the letter, be good at guiding and 
developing specialized rural commodity production, build a sound 
market system and a new economic structure characterized by a 
big circulation and a big market, and create favorable 
conditions under which peasants and enterprises will be able to 
comprehensively enter the market. 
  Comrade Yan Haiwang emphatically called in his speech for 
more energy to be devoted to increasing peasants' income, 
formulating measures suited to actual rural conditions, 
readjusting rural industrial structure, and expediting the pace 
of eradicating poverty, achieving prosperity, and bringing about 
a comparatively well-off livelihood. While readjusting the 
rural industrial structure, Yan Haiwang said, it is imperative 
to make continued and persistent efforts to stabilize and 
develop grain production and increase peasants' income. 
  Yan Haiwang maintained: It is imperative to go all out to 
develop products and industries with higher extra value, higher 
commodity rates, and higher foreign exchange earning rates and 
to implement a joint-stock cooperative system to improve the 
quality and vitality of township and town enterprises. In a 
word, we should strive to transform a rural economy into a 
market economy in an orderly way by carrying out effective 
macroeconomic regulation and control, enforcing laws and 
regulations aimed at protecting agriculture and peasants' 
interests, and comprehensively applying all sorts of economic 
measures and necessary administrative measures.

  [Excerpt] In 1993, our province's economic construction 
and various social undertakings gained further development. 
Looking back and ahead, how, facing the new circumstances and 
new tasks, shall we accomplish the province's economic targets 
for 1994 in a better way? With this question in mind, our staff 
reporter Guan Qizhi interviewed acting Governor Zhang Wule on 
New Year's eve. 
  Acting Governor Zhang Wule gave a systematic explanation of 
the economic approach and measures mapped out for 1994 in this 
province. Today, we bring you the first of the three parts of 
the recorded interview. 
  [Begin recording] [Guan] Governor Zhang, the year 1993 has 
now passed. What is your comment on our province's economic 
work in the past year? 
  [Zhang Wule] In 1993, the economic operation in our province 
has been basically normal. It has maintained a steady and 
healthy development momentum. If measured by the major economic 
growth indexes, the provincial GNP was 39.42 billion yuan, the 
growth rate being 10 percent; the second major index, the 
provincial income, was 28.44 billion yuan, the growth rate being 
10.5 percent; and the prescribed target for total industrial and 
agricultural output value was fulfilled. In particular, our 
economic efficiency has been improved to some extent this past 
year: The production-marketing rate of industry reached 94 
percent; the speed of funds circulation also accelerated; and 
the growth of sales income and deliverable profits and taxes 
obtained was faster than that of output value. In agriculture, 
the whole province attached great importance to grain output, 
which registered 14.8 billion jin this year. The past year has 
also witnessed the fastest growth of township and town 
enterprises in recent years, as their total output value reached 
16.8 billion yuan, the growth rate being over 50 percent. The 
net income of peasants was 550 yuan per capita. The actual 
financial revenue of the province, after all the above-mentioned 
data are factored in, is estimated at 4.58 billion yuan, the 
original target being 4.32 billion yuan. This represents a 14.6 
percent increase over last year. Using these major indexes, one 
should say that our economy has maintained a sustained and 
healthy development momentum. 
  But, in my opinion, we should recognize that there are 
problems in our economic development. Where are the major 
problems? I think I can sum them up with one point, that is, 
comparing our province's current level of economic development 
with the macroenvironment of the whole country, we can see that 
our main problem is the slowness in economic development, which 
calls for efforts to change through deepening the reform by 
various means. 
  [Guan] Governor Zhang, the year 1994 will be the first year 
for our province to achieve our next five-year objectives. It 
will also be a year when the largest number of reform measures 
will be promulgated. One can call it a year for solving key 
problems in the reform. Faced with this situation, what 
measures will our province adopt to boost its economy? 
  [Zhang] You are quite right to call next year a year for 
solving key problems in the reform. On a nationwide scale, the 
depth and breadth of the reform policies and measures to be 
promulgated next year will be unprecedented since 15 years ago 
when the reform and opening up began. Therefore, I feel we 
should pay attention to the following points when carrying out 
economic work in the coming year. First, we should 
conscientiously analyze the situation facing our province in 
terms of economic development. Second, we should find out the 
impact of the reform measures to be promulgated by the state on 
our province and work out matching policies and measures that we 
should adopt. Third, in light of such overall circumstances, we 
should establish and improve the basic strategies of our 
economic development. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] In 1993, our province's economic construction 
and various social undertakings gained further development. 
Looking back and ahead, how, facing the new circumstances and 
new tasks, shall we accomplish the province's economic targets 
for 1994 in a better way? With this question in mind, our staff 
reporter Guan Qizhi interviewed acting Governor Zhang Wule on 
New Year's eve. 
  Acting Governor Zhang Wule gave a systematic explanation of 
the economic approach and measures mapped out for 1994 in this 
province. Today, we bring you the second part of this interview. 
  [Begin recording] [Zhang] As to the reform measures to be 
promulgated by the central authorities next year, the provincial 
party committee and government, through conscientious study and 
discussion, are fully supportive of them, because they are 
measures that must be taken for the establishment of a market 
economy. Meanwhile, the local governments [words indistinct] on 
matters of importance, matters of principle. The reform of the 
financial and tax system is mainly aimed at introducing the 
system of tax sharing, or in other words, redividing all the tax 
categories of the state into central and local taxes. 
Therefore, this reform has the greatest impact on all 
localities. The reform of the monetary and investment system is 
mainly aimed at [words indistinct] technical transformation and 
the construction of infrastructure and differential policies 
will be adopted. For instance, in the sector of general 
industry and communications, there is strong competition which 
calls for complete adoption of the mechanism of market 
competition. Banks should be operated the way commercial banks 
work. Therefore, these projects are required to show relatively 
high efficiency and competitiveness. 
  The second category of projects are ones that have good 
social benefits, and especially transregional ones. They are 
key construction projects of the state. This is the second 
category. 
  The third category includes energy, communications, and raw 
materials projects. This category enjoys priority support from 
the state. According to this categorization, we have our 
advantages and disadvantages. For example, we are less 
competitive on competitive and transregional projects, while 
[words indistinct] on energy and raw materials projects. 
[passage omitted] 
  As to the price reforms, there will be many measures 
promulgated next year. For example, electricity charges will be 
raised, the price of raw coal will be completely decontrolled, 
and the price of oil will be basically decontrolled. This 
province foresees a grim situation as far as commodity prices 
are concerned. Therefore, the provincial government has decided 
that this province will not set forth any new price reform 
measures, so all those that are promulgated next year will be 
coming from the state. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lanzhou, January 18 (XINHUA) -- The fast progress in 
the application of science and technology in northwest China's 
Gansu Province has boosted local industrial and agricultural 
production. 
  Guided by the state development strategy for northwest 
China, 
large numbers of scientists and technicians have given up their 
better working and living environments in coastal areas to work 
in this remote province. 
  Thanks to their hard work over the past dozens of years, 
Gansu has laid a solid foundation for the application of science 
and technology. 
  The province now boosts China's first nuclear reactor, the 
first satellite launching pad, the only state laboratory housing 
a heavy- ion accelerator, as well as a number of state key 
laboratories specializing in research into geochemistry and 
tundra. 
  In addition, it now has a total of 768 scientific 
institutions with over 330,000 scientists and technicians. 
  Sine 1987 the province has registered over 4,400 major 
scientific achievements. Over 260 of these have won state 
awards and nearly 700 projects have won province-level awards. 
  The scientific achievements have helped the province make an 
additional 400 million yuan (50 million U.S. dollars) in 
production value. 
  According to a special survey conducted by the State Science 
and Technology Commission, the comprehensive scientific and 
technological capacity of Gansu now ranks ninth in China. 
  Meanwhile, the province has given priority to applying 
scientific achievements to farm production to upgrade 
agricultural productivity.

  [Text] Lanzhou, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Gansu Province 
produced more than one million tons of steel last year, thus 
becoming the no. 1 steel producer in northwest China. 
  According to local officials, the province met its target of 
gaining the capacity to produce an annual 930,000 tons of steel 
at the end of the Eighth Five-Year-Plan period (1991-1995) two 
years ahead of schedule. Last year's steel output represents an 
increase of 15.5 percent compared with the previous year. 
  Gansu, regarded as one of China's most backward areas, 
abounds in iron ore resources. With the introduction of reform 
measures concerning labor, personnel and distribution, the 
initiative of workers in local iron and steel companies have 
been brought into full play, and the province's steel output has 
increased at an annual rate of 80,000 tons to 100,000 tons over 
the past three years. Economic results were also enhanced for 
three years running. 
  Last year the province recorded 700 million yuan in profits 
and taxes from steel production.

  [Text] A provincial economic work meeting opened in Xining 
yesterday. The purpose of this meeting, which was sponsored by 
the provincial government, was to implement the spirit of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
national economic work meeting and to arrange economic work in 
the province this year. Provincial party and government leaders 
including Yin Kesheng [provincial party secretary], Tian 
Chengping [provincial governor], Cai Zhulin, Wang Hanmin 
[provincial vice governor], Huanjue Cenam, Ma Yuanbiao, La 
Bingli, Liu Guanghe, as well as people in charge of the relevant 
prefectural, city, and provincial government departments. 
  At the meeting, Wang Hanmin relayed the instructions of the 
national economic work meeting. Tian Chengping made a speech on 
how to make a success of this year's economic work. 
  In his speech, Governor Tian Chengping pointed out: Last 
year Qinghai basically maintained speedy and healthy economic 
development. The province's GNP and gross industrial and 
agricultural output value topped 10 billion yuan. In line with 
the policy of high quality, high yield, and high efficiency in 
agriculture, we adjusted its internal composition and gained 
good results. In industrial production, we freed ourselves from 
old practices and materialized speedy and healthy development. 
Investment in fixed assets and local revenue increased. All 
these have provided favorable conditions for this year's 
economic work. 
  Governor Tian Chengping continued: There are still many 
problems and difficulties in the province's economic work and 
these are restricting the province's normal economic operation. 
Therefore, in this new year, we must correctly seize the 
opportunity, take advantage of our favorable conditions, 
overcome our difficulties, and promote the province's economic 
work. 
  Governor Tian Chengping raised the following ideas for this 
year's economic work: Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
party's basic line, we will comprehensively implement the spirit 
of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
and seize the favorable opportunity to increase the momentum of 
reform and opening up and to expedite development. On the basis 
of optimizing structure, improving quality, and producing better 
economic results, we will maintain the sustained, speedy, and 
healthy development of the national economy. According to this 
guiding principle, Governor Tian Chengping requested all 
localities and departments to expedite the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure in this new year and to 
further widen the scope of opening up to the rest of the country 
and the world. 
  He said: This year is a crucial year for making overall 
progress and breaking through focal points in economic 
structural reform. There is a need to actively carry out 
enterprise reform in light of the province's specific 
conditions, to conscientiously implement the state's 
macrocontrol and regulatory measures, to further strengthen the 
position of agriculture and animal husbandry as the foundation, 
to develop the rural economy, to increase investments in 
resource exploitation, and to expedite the development of energy 
and raw materials industries.

  [Text] Xining, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Qinghai Province chalked up a record value of the total goods 
and services last year, with big progress in all the sectors, 
including agriculture, industry and foreign trade. 
  According to statistics from the local government, the 
province harvested 1.2 billion kg of grain and 150 million kg of 
oil-bearing crops in 1993, both record high. 
  Despite a rare storm at the beginning of last year, the 
province's stock breeding industry achieved good total in major 
livestock. 
  The output of the province's rural and township firms 
registered a 30 percent growth over 1992 to exceed one billion 
yuan (110 million U.S. dollars). 
  Qinghai's industry has picked up momentum, due to more 
technical input and reforms of companies' management systems. 
Many crisis-ridden trades, such as machinery and woollen 
industry, have stepped out of the doldrums. 
  More and more state-owned businesses have meshed with the 
demand of the market and produced a number of high-quality 
products, which are welcomed by consumers both in and out of the 
province. 
  Last year, Qinghai's total industry output amounted to eight 
billion dollars (990 million U.S. dollars). 
  In addition, local government further boosted individual and 
private enterprises. About 120 new trading markets have been 
put up, contributing to a four billion retail transaction last 
year. 
  In 1993, the province took great strides in foreign trade, 
with a total import and export volume of 100 million yuan (11 
million U.S. dollars). 
  Another 49 foreign-funded firms were built up, bringing in 
45 
million U.S. dollars in investment. 
  In addition, the province held a large-scale commercial fair 
in Hong Kong, striking 20 million U.S. dollars worth of deals 
and concluding 40 cooperative contracts with foreign companies, 
which will bring in another 300 million U.S. dollars. 
  Last year, the local government slashed a number of 
money-consuming construction projects to ensure energy and 
material supplies for key national projects. 
  By the end of last year, several key projects had been put 
into operation, such as a one-million-ton refinery in Golmud, 
the expansion of Qinghai Aluminium Plant and first-stage 
renovation work on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway.

  [Text] Xining, January 15 (XINHUA) -- Industrial 
production of salt, which used to be done on a small scale, with 
low-grade product and limited variety, has now developed into a 
pillar of the Qaidam Basin's economy, in northwest China's 
Qinghai Province. 
  The Qaidam Basin, one of the country's three major inland 
basins, covering an area of about 200,000 sq km, has 33 salt 
lakes in it. The salt reserves of various kinds and reserves of 
minerals are estimated to have a potential value of more than 
10,000 billion yuan. 
  With the intensified use of advanced technology for 
processing and production over the past years, more than 50 
processing and production enterprises, which have not long been 
established there, now turn out a dozen kinds of edible salt, as 
well as producing scores of quality chemical salt products. 
  Products of these enterprises now sell well in 23 provinces, 
municipalities and autonomous regions across the Chinese 
mainland, with the annual output value reaching 350 million yuan. 
  The Qaidam Basin has also been cooperating with an Israeli 
company for the building of a project on a cooperative basis, 
with the purpose of further tapping resources buried in salt 
lakes in the basin. 
  The cooperative project, with an intended annual production 
capacity of 800,000 tons of potash fertilizer, will raise the 
present production capacity of 200,000 tons of potash 
fertilizers of the entire basin to one million tons when the 
project is finished in 1997, according to local officials.

  [Excerpts] At a provincial meeting on financial and 
taxation work, Vice Govenor Xu Shanlin stressed the need for 
financial and taxation cadres at all levels to fully understand 
the important impact of financial and taxation reform on future 
economic development; properly handle the relations between 
reform, development, and stability; and to promote the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure. 
  This meeting was held in Xian on 13 January. [passage 
omitted] 
  The meeting pointed out that all levels of financial 
departments should closely cooperate with taxation departments 
in strengthening tax collections and management and should 
strictly observe the new taxation system. Governments and 
departments at all levels, including financial and taxation 
departments, should actively implement finance policy and take 
part in adjusting enterprises' organization and industrial 
structure to create conditions for the transformation of 
enterprises' operational mechanisms. [passage omitted] 
  It is necessary to reform the supervisory method on 
financial 
work, implement the regulations on the supervision of 
state-owned assets, strengthen management of state-owned assets, 
and prevent the loss of state-owned assets. [passage omitted] 
  At the meeting, Vice Governor Xu Shanlin requested finance 
cadres at all levels to change their concepts and resolve new 
problems with new ideas and new methods. He pointed out: The 
general idea of improving the province's financial resources is 
to adjust and optimize the industrial structure and product mix, 
open up new financial resources, improve the economic results of 
large and medium-sized state enterprises, speedily develop 
tertiary industries and township and town enterprises, and 
boldly develop the nonstate- owned economic sector and a 
diversified rural economy.

  [Text] Xian, January 13 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Shaanxi Province has paid great attention to the development of 
agriculture over the past few years and the efforts have paid 
off. 
  The province has reaped bumper grain harvests for three 
years 
running despite frequent natural disasters. Last year, the 
grain output of the province hit a record of over 12 billion kg. 
  Local agricultural officials attributed the success mainly 
to 
the efforts made by the provincial government in improving basic 
facilities for agricultural use. 
  According to local sources, in the past six years, the 
province has managed to raise more than three billion yuan 
(about 345 million U.S. dollars) for farmland improvement 
projects, such as building of more water control works and 
arable land, and for the harnessing of biological environment 
and for comprehensive agricultural development. 
  In addition, the province has also introduced more than 500 
million U.S. dollars in foreign investment to support the 
development of agriculture. 
  At the same time, the province, believed to be one of the 
country's most backward areas, has also strengthened the 
manufacturing of means of production for agricultural use and 
sped up the construction of mechanization of agriculture.

  [Text] Xian, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Shaanxi Province has become a major apple producer. 
  Total output reached 1.3 million tons last year, up 60 
percent over 1992. This accounts for one-seventh of the 
country's total and lifts the province as the second largest 
apple grower. 
  Most parts of Shaanxi are situated on the loess plateau, 
which is blessed by ample sunshine and has wide difference in 
temperature between day and night. The location and the climate 
make the site ideal for apple growing. 
  Since 1984, more than 20 counties have been converted into 
apple growing centers. The acreage soared from the 123,500 
acres in 1985 to around 823,500 acres last year. Quality stock 
make up over 80 percent of all the fruit trees planted. 
  Some counties have set up factories to produce apple juice 
for other countries. 
  The development of the fruit orchards has greatly helped 
farmers to improve their lives. Most of the apple growers now 
live in newly-built brick-and-wood houses instead of the earth 
caves where they used to dwell. Eight out of ten families own 
TV sets and 70 percent of homes have motorcycles and tractors. 
  The income from the apples enabled the local people to 
increase input in grain production too.

  [Text] Beijing, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Fundamental changes 
have taken place in China's intellectual, scientific and 
technological circles in comparison with more than a decade ago, 
a top official said here today. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference and member of the 
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese 
Communist Party's Central Committee, made the remarks at a 
gathering of more than 400 Chinese scientific and technological 
workers. 
  He attributed this to the correct leadship of Deng Xiaoping, 
who determined the guideline of making economic construction the 
center of the party's work and voiced the thesis that 
"intellectuals are a part of the working class" and "science and 
technology are the primary productive forces". 
  Li noted that the situation in the intellectual, scientific 
and technological circles is generally good, though there are 
some problems. 
  He encouraged scientific and technological workers to 
combine 
science and technology more closely with the development of 
production, with reference to foreign experience. 
  State Councillor Song Jian greeted the Chinese scientific 
and 
technological workers on behalf of the State Council. 
  Song Jian said that more investment should be put into the 
development of science and technology and governments at all 
levels should further improve the working and living conditions 
for the scientific and technological workers.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Zhang Hongtou (1728 3163 3447)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- Mr. Zhang 
Tong, president of the China Great Wall Industry Corporation, 
said today that there is no reason to continue sanctions on his 
company by the United States and that he regrets this. 
  Zhang Tong said this to reporters after a signing ceremony 
held here between the China Great Wall Industry Corporation and 
Asia-Pacific Satellite Telecommunications Company on a 
commercial launch service for the Asia-Pacific Sat-2 satellite, 
saying that the China Great Wall Industry Corporation's 
commercial launch services for international satellite clients 
are a useful supplement to the international satellite launching 
market and provide options for international satellite users. 
He said that we welcome the U.S. Government's recent 
announcement to lift the ban on three satellites that will be 
launched by China, though regrettably this did not include the 
sanctions on the China Great Wall Industry Corporation. With the 
imminent dissolution of COCOM [Coordinating Committee for 
Multilateral Export Controls], the U.S. Government should adjust 
its current space policy, issue other satellite permits, and 
revoke sanctions on the corporation. This would not only 
benefit international clients, but would also protect the 
interests of U.S. satellite makers. Furthermore, he said, with 
the expiration at the end of this year of the memorandum on 
commercial launch services and international trade problems 
signed between the Chinese and U.S. Governments in 1989, we hope 
that the U.S. and Chinese Governments can begin talks on the 
issue of extending the memorandum as soon as possible in order 
to facilitate a good environment for normal space trade between 
the two countries. 
  Zhang Tong revealed that since China announced the 
introduction of its self-made Long March carrier rocket series 
to the international market in 1985, the corporation, in joint 
efforts with its domestic partners -- namely the Research 
Institute of Carrier Rocket Technology, which researches and 
produces rockets, and the China Satellite Launch Detection and 
Control System Department, which takes charge of launch 
operations, detection, and control -- has steadily eased, after 
years of arduous work, China's carrier rockets into the 
international commercial satellite launching service market. 
The Great Wall Industry Corporation has successfully launched 
many satellites for international clients. Other launch services 
under contract include the International Communications 
Satellite 7A, Asia-Pacific Sat-1, Asiasat 2, Iridium and Echo 
Satellites, and a resources satellite in cooperation with 
Brazil. As it has done in the past, the China Great Wall 
Industry Corporation will, with its good reputation and quality 
work, offer its clients reliable services.

  [Text] Beijing, January 18 (XINHUA) -- China will provide 
the service of launching the Asia-Pacific Satellite No. 2 toward 
the end of this year, according to a contract signed here today 
between the China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC) and 
the Asia-Pacific Satellite Telecommunications Co. Ltd. 
  The Asia-Pacific Sat-2 is a large-capacity HS601 
telecommunications satellite made by the United States' Hughes 
Company. It will be launched by using the Long March 2E booster 
carrier rocket between October and December in China's Xichang 
satellite launch center, according to the contract. 
  Zhang Tong, president of the CGWIC, said at today's signing 
ceremony that since 1985, when the Chinese Government announced 
that it was bidding for international satellite launches with 
Chinese-made Long March carrier rockets, China has successfully 
launched a number of overseas satellites and contracts that are 
being performed involved the launching of Intelsat 7A, 
Asia-Pacific Sat-1, Asiasat 2, a number of iridium satellites, 
echo satellite and a resources satellite of Brazil. 
  Zhang said that in the past few years the CGWIC has used 
multi- model Long March carrier rockets in the international 
commercial launching service, and the result of market 
development has promoted rocket research. 
  At present the Long March series can meet the demand of 
various launches in the international market, including the 
launching of small, medium-size and large satellites to low, 
middle and high orbits. 
  He said the international satellite launching service by 
CGWIC is a good supplement to the international launching market 
and it also provides new opportunities for satellite owners. 
The U.S. Government has lately lifted the ban on three 
satellites that will be launched by China, a move which deserves 
welcome; but it was regrettable that the U.S. Government has not 
removed its sanctions on the CGWIC. 
  Zhang added that the U.S. Government should readjust its 
present space policies, remove sanctions on the CGWIC and give 
licences to other related satellites, which would not only 
benefit satellite owners, but also protect the interests of U.S. 
satellite producers. 
  Sources said the memorandum on the agreement of 
international 
trade problems for commercial launching service signed in 1989 
by the Chinese and U.S. Governments will expire by the end of 
this year.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Gao Jinan: "China To Launch 2nd </F>
Satellite for Firm"] 
  [Text] The China Great Wall Industrial Corporation (CGWIC) 
yesterday signed a contract with a Hong Kong-based company to 
launch a communications satellite using a Chinese rocket carrier 
later this year. 
  The satellite, to be put into orbit between October and 
December, is manufactured by the Hughes Corporation of the U.S. 
  It will be the second satellite launched by China for Asia 
Pacific Satellite Communications Co. Ltd of Hong Kong. 
  Asia Pacific plans to launch the first satellite in the 
first 
half of this year from Xichang Space Centre in Sichuan Province 
on a Long March-2E rocket carrier, according to a December 1992 
contract with the CGWIC. 
  The second satellite, HS601, a large capacity satellite, 
will 
blast off from Xichang using the same model of rocket. 
  Both sides refused to disclose costs for the launch. 
  Zhang Tong, president of the CGWIC, was pleased with the 
recent decision by the U.S. Government to lift export bans on 
three satellites to China. 
  "It is a positive move and we appreciate the decision," he 
said before the contract-signing ceremony at the Diaoyutai State 
Guesthouse. 
  But Zhang also expressed regret the U.S. still places other 
restrictions on his company. 
  The U.S. imposed the satellite export ban last August after 
the alleged sale of missiles and technology by China to Pakistan. 
  He hoped the U.S. will issue export permits to other 
satellites and lift its sanctions on the CGWIC. 
  "By doing so, it will be beneficial to the international 
satellite customers and it will also protect the benefits of the 
U.S. satellite manufacturers," he said. 
  Zhang also hoped the Chinese and U.S. Governments will start 
negotiations on commercial satellite launching and international 
trade before the current agreement expires at the end of this 
year. The current satellite agreement was signed in 1989. 
  China will honour all launching contracts signed with 
overseas customers. They include the Asia Sat-2 communications 
satellite for the Asia Satellite Telecommunications Co Ltd, the 
Intelsat-7A telecommunications satellite for the International 
Telecommunications Satellite Organization, the Iridium 
satellites for the U.S. Motorola Company and two APT satellites 
this year and next year.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 20 (XINHUA) -- The first domestic 
satellite ground station built in Shanghai is now in operation. 
  It will open 1,190 lines in 11 directions to such big cities 
as Beijing, Shenyang, Harbin, Hohhot, Urumqi, Lhasa and Haikou. 
  This is the first of four such stations installed in China 
by 
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. 
  The station, located in the city's southwestern suburbs on a 
site of more than 2.6 hectares, is a huge modern building with 
two cassegrain antennas, one being 16 meters in diameter and the 
other 13 meters in diameter. 
  The garden-like ground station, which cost 57 million yuan, 
can be linked, if so desired, to international telecom networks 
since it also passed the test of the International Telecom 
Organization.

<F P=106> [By reporters Cao Yuhe (2580 3768 0735) and Wang Baoan (3769 </F>
0202 1344): "Nearly 1,000 Shanghai Scientific and Technological 
Personnel Make Joint Efforts to Tackle Key Problems, 
Meticulously Develop 600,000 kw-Capacity Nuclear Power Station, 
Complete 60 Percent of the Projects Whose Key Problems Need To 
Be Tackled, and Obtain Orders Worth Over 500 million Yuan From 
Both Home and Abroad"] 
  [Text] At present, nearly 1,000 scientific and 
technological workers in the municipality are making vigorous 
efforts to develop new materials and new equipment for a 600,000 
kw-capacity nuclear power station. According to statistics, 
they successfully tackled key problems of 20 important 
scientific and technological projects last year; coupled with 
the 34 projects completed over the previous four years, they 
have completed 60 percent of the total projects whose key 
problems need to be tackled and have obtained orders worth 570 
million yuan from both home and abroad for Shanghai so far. 
  China has determined the 600,000 kw-capacity nuclear power 
station as the standard type of reactor to be built for a 
considerable period of time to come. The second phase project 
of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station will build a 600,000 
kw-capacity nuclear power station. Shanghai undertook the task 
to develop most of the new materials and new equipment for it. 
The municipal office responsible for tackling key scientific 
and technological problems of major industries listed 89 
projects whose key scientific and technological problems need to 
be tackled. They involve many branches of learning, such as 
machine-building, electronics, metallurgy, chemical industry, 
instrument and meter, and so forth. More than 40 scientific 
research institutes, universities and colleges, factories, and 
enterprises have won the bids through public biddings. To date, 
the outlays committed by the state to tackling key scientific 
and technological problems have reached over 13 million yuan. 
  Zirconium alloy, which is touted as "the number one metal of 
the atomic age," has been successfully developed by the Shanghai 
Nonferrous Metal Materials Research Institute. The magnet wire 
coil and wire indicatrix for indicating the position of a rod to 
be installed in the drive mechanism for the control rod of a 
600,000 kw-capacity nuclear power facility are required to be 
able to resist heat 50 percent more than the same materials of a 
300,000 kw- capacity nuclear power station are capable of. A 
task force headed by Senior Engineer Ling Chunhua of the 
Shanghai Electric Cable Research Institute succeeded in 
developing such materials after three years of research. 
  The successful tackling of many key scientific and 
technological problems is a result of concerted efforts by 
scientific research institutes, universities and colleges, 
factories, and enterprises. The Shanghai Instrument and Meter 
Elastic Component Factory fulfilled the task of conducting 
research in stainless steel pipe with multiple corrugations to 
be used for the return circuit valve in a nuclear power station 
under cooperation with the Applied Mathematics Research 
Institute, Mechanics Research Institute, and Bellows Research 
Center of the Shanghai Engineering University. As a result, 
China becomes a nation exporting such equipment, instead of 
importing it. The Shanghai Power Station Package Equipment 
Research Institute assisted the Shanghai Turbine Factory to 
carry out an important renovation of the two-tier high pressure 
cylinder for a nuclear turbine, thereby facilitating the 
manufacture and assembly of such equipment.

  [Text] Lanzhou, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists 
have made breakthroughs in the study of gas geochemistry, 
promoting the country's exploration of oil and gas, and study of 
the changes of the global climate and environment. 
  This science, which is only about a decade old, involves 
research into natural resources, and changes of climate and 
environment, and forecasting and prevention of geological 
disasters. 
  China's key laboratory for gas geochemistry was set up at 
the 
Lanzhou Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
in this capital of northwest China's Gansu Province in 1985. It 
was opened to foreign scientists in 1991. 
  Since then, Chinese scientists have made great progress in 
research into the storage and transformation of oil and gas, 
changes of global climate and environment, and seismic 
activities. 
  Since 1991 the laboratory has completed 792 major research 
projects designated by the state, related state ministries and 
Gansu Province. 
  Chinese scientists at the lab have put forward a new theory 
of "multi-sources and continuous formation in different stages" 
for the formation of natural gas. 
  Meanwhile, they have made new progress in the study of 
geological structure, volcanoes and earthquakes by using helium 
isotopes. 
  They have also developed a series of new technologies and 
methods for the exploration of oil and gas, which have made 
great contributions to the development of the Tarim Basin in the 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  At a state project appraisal meeting, some well-known 
scholars described the lab as a showcase of China's study of gas 
geochemistry, calling it an international center of the science. 
  The lab has academic exchanges and co-operation with many 
countries and regions, including Germany, the United States, 
Sweden, Russia, Japan and Italy.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists 
have succeeded in the synthesis of a kind of memory-stimulating 
peptide found in animal brains, a great step in the study of 
neurobiology. 
  According to the scientists with the Shanghai Biochemical 
Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the 
memory peptide is a substance existing in higher animals. 
  On the basis of repeated animal experiments, the scientists 
undertook systematic research of the molecular structure and 
neural function of the peptide and developed a workable 
illustration of its position in the animal brain and the 
mechanism by which it enhances memory. 
  Scientific experiments proved that the artificially produced 
memory peptide is able to promote and extend memory and speed up 
the recovery of memory damage. As a result, it is expected to 
be beneficial in treating senile amnesia and dementia.

  [Text] Changchun, January 15 (XINHUA) -- China is to put 
into mass production color liquid crystal displays used in small 
computers. 
  This hi-tech product was developed by the Changchun Physics 
Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences through three 
years of researches. 
  The institute will sell the technology to several major 
enterprises in China, which will produce small-sized crystal 
displays to be installed in mini personal computers, electronic 
notebooks, palm-top translators, video-telephones and desk-top 
fax machines. 
  According to an official who participated in the national 
appraisal of the product, the technical level of the display is 
among the most advanced of the 1990s in the world. 
  At present, the market for liquid crystal displays is mainly 
dominated by Japanese products. Experts predict that the world 
market for such displays will be worth 15 billion U.S. dollars 
by the end of this year.

  [Text] Beijing, January 24 (XINHUA) -- In spite of progress 
in environmental protection, China's environmental pollution 
remains serious, a leading Chinese environmental official said 
here today, 
  Zhang Kunmin, deputy chief of the State Bureau for 
Environmental Protection (SBEP), said China has set up an 
effective and efficient environmental protection administrative 
system during the past decade or more while promoting its 
economic development. 
  "China's gross national product (GNP) has doubled during the 
past decades, but its environment has not deteriorated 
accordingly, and in some areas environmental pollution has even 
been reduced," the official said. 
  Speaking at an international symposium on the environmental 
protection action plan, Zhang said that it still remains an 
arduous task for China to create an ideal environment in the 
coming years because of its huge and growing population and 
rapidly expanding economy. 
  According to statistics, China's nearly 1.2 billion 
population grows by 15 million each year on average, while its 
cultivated land is shrinking at an average rate of 300,000 ha 
[hectares] each year. The per capita share of the major 
resources in China, such as fresh water, cultivated land, 
forest, grassland and important mineral resources, is much lower 
than the world's average. 
  Gao Guangsheng, an official from the State Planning 
Commission, said that the total amount of standard fuel and 
metal consumed each year by China will be twice as much as the 
total consumed by the world in 1970 if China's economy continues 
to grow rapidly in a traditional development pattern and China's 
per capita GNP reaches 4,000 U.S. dollars by the mid-21st 
century. 
  "Obviously, the traditional development strategy is in no 
way 
acceptable to China," said Gao. 
  He said that China has been paying close attention to the 
experiences drawn by developed countries and mapped out a 
strategy for sustainable economic and social development. 
  In response to the earth summit meeting in Brazil in 1992, 
China has made up "10 countermeasures on the environment and 
development", "China's Agenda 21", a strategy for China's 
sustainable economic and social development in the coming 
century, and "China's Environmental Protection Action Plan" in 
the past two years. 
  "China expects more cooperation with other countries and 
international institutions in environmental protection since 
China lacks expertise and investment in those regards," Zhang 
said. 
  Also present at the seminar were about 60 environmental 
experts or officials, including some from Britain, Germany, 
Denmark, Canada and China, and some foreign diplomats in China. 
  The four-day seminar was jointly held by SBEP, the State 
Planning Commission and the State Foreign Experts' Affairs 
Bureau.

  [Text] Beijing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- China is putting the 
final touches to its environmental protection action plan, which 
aims to bring its worsening environmental pollution basically 
under control by the year 2000. 
  Wang Yuqing, director of the Planning Department of the 
State 
Environmental Protection Agency, said that China's environmental 
protection action plan -- a ten-year agenda -- will contain the 
general objectives of environmental protection, main targets of 
pollution control and the protection of the ecological 
environment in China by the year 2000. 
  China's economy has doubled during the past 15 years -- and 
is to grow at an estimated 10 percent annually -- which has 
caused an acute shortage of power and increasing energy 
consumption, 70 percent of it coal. 
  Speaking at an international seminar on environmental 
protection action plan, Wang said that China now faces seven 
pressing environmental problems, including water pollution, air 
pollution in cities, harmful industrial waste and garbage 
pollution in cities, lack of water resources, soil erosion, low 
afforestation percentage and grassland degradation, and decrease 
of species. 
  "These environmental problems have greatly affected the 
health of the people, hindered the improvement of their living 
standard and economic development," Wang said. 
  He noted that China will formulate industrial and economic 
policies for sustainable development, enhance environmental 
legislation and law enforcement, and improve existing 
environmental protection agencies. 
  "As a developing country with limited human, material and 
financial resources, China will have to set priorities of its 
environmental protection work," said the official. 
  He said that China will focus on environmental protection in 
cities, especially 52 major cities on the government's list for 
environmental protection, in which the focus should be on the 
control of water, air, solid waste and noise pollution. 
  He disclosed that China has selected about 9,000 major 
polluting enterprises as the targets for pollution control. 
  As far as the protection of nature is concerned, priority 
will be given to the protection of biological resources, such as 
forests, grassland, desert plants, animals and particularly 
precious and endangered species. 
  Zhang Kunmin, deputy director of the State Environmental 
Protection Agency, told the seminar yesterday said that it 
"still remained an arduous task" for China to create an ideal 
environment in the coming years because of its huge and growing 
population and rapidly expanding economy.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhu Baoxia: "State Gives Go-Ahead to </F>
Green Foundation"] 
  [Text] The central government is to set up a foundation to 
provide low-interest loans to major environmental projects, it 
was announced yesterday. 
  The foundation is meant to be a stable source of 
low-interest 
finance to fight widespread pollution, with no extra burden on 
the State budget, said Xie Zhenhua, director of the State 
Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa). 
  Xie told an expert meeting in Beijing yesterday that the 
country's environment had been deteriorating in all but a few 
places for years. 
  One of the major factors in the growing problem has been a 
lack of cash, Xie said. 
  In the 1980s, the State invested 64.7 billion yuan (about 
$11.3 billion at the old exchange rate) on environmental 
projects, 0.6 percent of gross domestic product over the decade. 
  Experts say at least 75 billion yuan ($8.6 billion at the 
current exchange rate) more is needed in the next six years, if 
the State is to contain worsening pollution. 
  Xie stressed the government should be just one source of 
cash 
and more channels must be found to guarantee quick, sustainable 
environmental protection. 
  The repayable foundation system is one of the more feasible 
and effective approaches to attract cash, he said. 
  It aims to provide cash mainly to industrial 
pollution-control projects which will be repaid from the 
resulting savings the factories make. 
  The foundation will be built with cash from the State 
budget, 
grants and loans from international organizations, foreign 
governments and individuals and domestic donations. 
  Its draft programme being discussed at the expert meeting 
which ends today suggests a national environmental protection 
investment company be set up to organize fundraising and loans. 
  The company, which is subordinate to Sepa, will be 
responsible for collecting funds, selecting projects and 
supervising the use of loans. 
  Priority would be given to cross-province pollution control 
and environmental projects outlined in international and 
bilateral agreements. 
  The company will also invest in pollution-control projects 
in 
major State-owned enterprises to set an example for other 
industries. 
  Xie said Sepa is set to start pilot environmental projects 
in 
21 provinces and cities, including Beijing, Guangzhou, Liaoning 
and Heilongjiang. 
  The national environmental foundation programme was based on 
an experiment first introduced five years ago in Shenyang, a 
heavy industry city in Northeast China's Liaoning Province. 
  Shenyang, with over 5,000 industrial enterprises, has long 
been one of the country's most seriously-polluted cities. 
  The Shenyang Environmental Protection Investment Company 
(Sepic) has loaned 162 million yuan (over $28 million) to local 
factories since 1988 to help technical renovation designed to 
control industrial pollution.

  [Text] Beijing, January 21 (XINHUA) -- China's State 
Council has decided to establish the academician system in the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the country's top scientific 
body, and grant CAS members the official title of "Academician". 
  Under a decree of the State Council, membership of the CAS 
is 
the highest academic title in China, representing the highest 
scientific honor and supreme academic authority of the country. 
  "The CAS members are now completely on an equal footing with 
academicians of other countries," a spokesman for the CAS said. 
  The spokesman said that the academician system will promote 
China's scientific and technological exchanges with other 
countries and is consonant with the country's reform and opening 
endeavors. 
  It also indicates China's ever-increasing academic strength 
and burgeoning of talent, he said. 
  The CAS, which was founded in November 1949, now has 545 
members, or academicians as they are officially called now.

Dahao (0151 1129 1170): "Do a Good Job in Microeconomic 
Regulation and Control To Create Conditions for Deepening Reform 
-- Lu Rongjing and Wang Yang Speak on Issues Concerning the 
Reform of the Planning System"] 
  [Text] "On the basis of summarizing this year's 
experiences, planning committees at all levels in our province 
should do a better job of microeconomic regulation and control 
to create conditions for the smooth launching of various major 
reform measures next year." At a provincial meeting on planning 
work, provincial party Secretary Lu Rongjing made the above 
remark while hearing reports given by responsible comrades from 
the provincial planning committee. Wang Yang, member of the 
Standing Committee of the provincial party committee and vice 
governor, also gave a speech at the meeting. 
  Lu Rongjing pointed out: As a result of microeconomic 
regulation and control, our province realized sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development in its economic and social undertakings 
this year. Not only did cadres at all levels and the broad 
masses of people understand and support these undertakings, but 
the CPC Central Committee and the State Council also fully 
endorsed our achievements. Planning committees at all levels 
had a lot to do with these achievements. 
  In speaking on planning committees' work next year, Lu 
Rongjing called for integrating the CPC Central Committee's 
guidelines with Anhui's actual situation in three areas. He 
said: First, we should study the new environment and the new 
situation, be in control of the intangible but dynamic changes 
of the market environment, make good forecasts, and continue to 
improve Anhui's microeconomic regulation and control to promote 
our province's economic development, especially development in 
agriculture and village and town enterprises. Second, we must 
pay closer attention to the key projects in our province so as 
to expand the chances for Anhui's economic development. Third, 
planning committees themselves must become more successful to 
accommodate the new situation. 
  Lu Rongjing said emphatically: The basic way to solve 
Anhui's problems in economic development lies in reform. The 
reform measures to be launched by the CPC Central Committee will 
involve all quarters. In addition to the reform of the planning 
system, all other reforms are related to planning committees. 
While quickening the pace of reform, we must advance firmly and 
steadily to make substantial progress and ensure the smooth 
launching of all supplementary reform measures. 
  While holding discussions with planning committee directors 
at the prefecture, city, and county levels and with leading 
cadres of major enterprises, Wang Yang pointed out: While 
enforcing the central authorities' microeconomic regulation and 
control, we have further defined local authorities' 
responsibilities by delimiting their rights, responsibilities, 
and benefits. Because of this, local authorities have in a way 
become more capable of regulating the economy, and this will 
help central and local authorities to bring their initiative 
into play. Planning committees must work hard to solve problems 
-- problems which have arisen in development -- through reform 
and must bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development in Anhui. 
  Wang Yang urged planning committees in our province to 
intensify their reform of the systems governing investment and 
interbanking loans, and to blaze a new trail in the rapid 
raising of capital. We should first draw up regulations, 
properly divide up responsibilities, and define powers for 
managing investment for infrastructure, competitive projects, 
and public welfare services. We should start this work next year 
and perfect the regulations when we do the job. After the 
investment system has been reformed, we should do everything 
possible to open more channels for raising capital. We should 
also manage well state-owned fixed assets, better manage the 
inventories of enterprises which are in better shape, and save a 
group of enterprises which is in distress.

  [Text] Hefei, January 19 (XINHUA) -- East China's Anhui 
Province has seen continued increase of investment from Taiwan 
companies since 1986, according to a provincial government 
official. 
  Zhuge Ren, director of the provincial Taiwan Affairs Office, 
said that Taiwan firms have invested a total of 374 million U.S. 
dollars in Anhui since the first Taiwan-funded company was set 
up in 1986. 
  In 1993 provincial authorities approved 192 new 
Taiwan-funded 
businesses, up 35 percent over the year before. The province 
now has 370 such businesses, Zhuge said. 
  Government statistics show that more than 180,000 people of 
Anhui origin now live in Taiwan, while 230,000 residents of 
Anhui are relatives of Taiwan residents. 
  "The scale of Taiwan investment has been increasing over the 
past two years," Zhuge Ren said. 
  Today, 100 Taiwan-funded companies involve an investment 
exceeding one million U.S. dollars each and 40 such companies 
involve an investment of at least three million dollars each, he 
said. 
  Taiwan companies used to invest only in such labor-intensive 
industries as shoemaking, garments and plastics processing, he 
said. 
  But now, more and more Taiwan companies are investing in 
high- tech and capital-intensive industries such as electronics, 
computers, telecommunications, chemicals, machine building, 
building materials, electrical appliance, real estate, tourism 
and transportation industries, he added. 
  Zhuge said Anhui will further improve its investment 
environment and provide better services for Taiwan investors 
this year. 
  For example, a new company will be launched later this year 
to provide consultancy services for Taiwan companies with regard 
to trade, export and investment in building production 
facilities.

  [Excerpts] A provincial meeting on economic work opened in 
Nanchang this morning. The meeting's main objectives are to 
convey the guidelines set by the national meeting on economic 
work and the ninth plenary session of the ninth provincial party 
committee and to assign economic tasks for this year. Present 
at this morning's session were: Provincial Governor Wu 
Guanzheng; Vice Governors Shu Shengyou, Zhou Zheping, Zheng 
Liangyu, and Zhang Yunchuan; assistants to the governor Jiang 
Zhongping and Sun Yonghe; and Secretary General Zhu Yingpei. 
The morning session was presided over by Huang Zhiquan. Shu 
Shengyou briefed the participants on the guidelines laid by the 
national meeting on economic work and delivered a speech. 
  In his speech, Shu Shengyou first briefed the participants 
on 
the current economic situation and the main economic tasks to be 
carried out this year. He said: 1993 is a year in which the 
people of this province carried out in depth the guidelines of 
the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, deepened the ongoing reform, 
sped up development, and achieved great success in economic and 
other social undertakings. 
  Last year saw the widest margin of increase in major 
economic 
indexes ever achieved by the province since the beginning of 
reform and opening up. What is more, such growth was achieved 
on the basis of the high growth registered over the past 
consecutive years. The year 1994 will be an important year in 
which this province is to maintain the momentum of sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development as well as a crucial year in 
which we are to expedite reform aimed at establishing a 
socialist market economy. 
  This year, the guiding philosophy of economic work in the 
province is to uphold Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line as the guide; to conscientiously implement the guidelines 
laid by the 14th CPC National Congress, the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the ninth plenary 
session of the ninth provincial party committee; to 
comprehensively expedite all the major reforms finalized by the 
central authorities; to appropriately handle the relationship 
between reform, development, and social stability; and to thus 
ensure a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
province's economy while vigorously improving economic returns 
and optimizing the production structure and strive for general 
progress in all social undertakings. 
  Shu Shengyou pointed out: We must strive for progress on all 
fronts while seeking breakthroughs in certain key aspects, and 
we must make up our minds to achieve victory in the most 
difficult aspects of reform. He said: This year, our main 
tasks in reform are to speed up the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system, with a focus on the program to start pilot 
projects in one aspect and to strive for development in two 
others. With the reform of the national financial and taxation, 
banking, planning, and investment systems as a starting point, 
we are to push forward the reform of the macroeconomic 
regulation and control system and to expedite the transformation 
of government functions. 
  We are to vigorously develop a market of production 
elements, 
further nurture the market network, appropriately introduce all 
the supporting reforms -- in particular step up the reform of 
the social security system -- actively develop the individual 
and private economic sector, modify the ownership structure, do 
a good job in the reform of foreign exchange and foreign trade 
systems according to the state's centralized plan, further 
expand the process of opening up to the outside world, carry out 
in depth the reform of the rural economic structure, and 
establish a rural market economic operational mechanism full of 
vigor and vitality, among others. [passage omitted] 
  Shu Shengyou said: It is necessary to vigorously explore the 
urban and rural markets and make special efforts to develop and 
perfect the market system. It is necessary to speed up reform 
of circulation structure, invigorate the state-owned commodity 
circulation sector, give rein to the individual and private 
economic sector in the area of commodity circulation, and, in 
particular, encourage peasants to play a part in commodity 
circulation. 
  Shu Shengyou noted that it is necessary to do a really good 
job in finance and taxation, make every effort to increase 
financial revenue, pay attention to exploring new sources of 
taxes, further intensify control over tax collection, keep 
financial expenditures under strict control, improve budgetary 
management, and intensify the regulatory function of budgets. 
  Shu Shengyou demanded that the relations between reform, 
development, and stability be properly handled and that 
appropriate arrangements be made to keep up the people's 
standard of living. It is necessary to carefully and 
meticulously map out a plan before introducing measures 
regarding price reform and to make every effort to keep the 
margin of price increases below the level as set in the plan. 
Governments at all levels and departments concerned must 
properly keep the prices of rice, foodstuffs, and fuel under 
control, with a view to pacifying the public and maintaining 
social stability. [passage omitted] 
  Also present at this morning's session were more than 700 
people, including prefectural administrative commissioners; 
mayors of ordinary cities as well as cities that are separately 
listed in the state plan; directors of prefectural and city 
planning commissions, economic commissions, and commissions for 
restructuring economic systems; directors of local financial, 
economic and trade, commodity price, and taxation bureaus; 
principal persons-in-charge of all provincial departments; 
persons-in-charge at and above the deputy departmental head 
level from the provincial overall planning and economic 
departments; persons-in-charge of some institutes of higher 
learning; and participants in the ongoing provincial conference 
on finance and taxation.

  [Text] At the recent provincial conference of presidents of 
intermediate people's courts, Li Wenquan, deputy secretary of 
the provincial party committee, pointed out: It is necessary to 
comprehensively give play to the judicial functional role of the 
people's courts, maintain social stability in our province, and 
safeguard and promote the smooth progress of reform, opening up, 
and economic construction. 
  Li Wenquan said: The deeper we conduct reform and the more 
we develop the market economy, the more we need to improve the 
socialist democracy and the legal system and the more central 
the comprehensive judicial role of the people's courts becomes. 
Therefore, courts at all levels should further strengthen the 
guiding ideology of serving reform, opening up, and economic 
construction, comprehensively conduct all sorts of judicial 
work, enhance the consciousness of enforcing law strictly and 
manage things strictly in line with law. It is necessary to 
strengthen the building of ranks of court personnel and improve 
the quality of the ranks of judges. The party committees, 
people's congresses and governments at all levels should pay 
attention to, care for and support the work of courts and pay 
attention to helping courts solve practical difficulty in work 
and construction. 
  Yu Peigao, president of the provincial Higher People's 
Court, also gave a speech at the conference.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's 
leading industrial city, is quickening its steps toward a market 
economy as eight more exchanges for production materials have 
been built in one year. 
  These markets trade in oil, coal, automobiles, grain and 
edible oil, machinery and electronic products, as well as 
chemicals and building and farming materials. 
  Together with the existing stock and metal exchanges, the 
ten 
markets scored a transaction volume totalling 1,000 billion yuan 
(115 billion U.S. dollars) last year, equal to two-fifths of 
China's gross national product in 1992. 
  Experts said that the markets, covering pillar sectors such 
as industry, agriculture, energy, finance and technology, will 
have an impact on the whole economy of the country. 
  The stock trading volume of the Shanghai exchange totalled 
nearly 500 billion yuan (57.5 U.S. dollars) in 1993, eight times 
the figure for the previous year. China now has two 
state-approved bourses, one in Shanghai and the other in 
Shenzhen. 
  Last year 21 million tons of non-ferrous metals changed 
hands 
on the Shanghai market, the second-biggest such trading volume 
in the world. The exchange, opened in May 1991, had a 
transaction volume of almost 400 billion yuan (46 billion U.S. 
dollars) last year. 
  These markets have not only adopted the membership and sound 
money systems, but have also taken to modern trading methods, 
such as public bidding and central clearing. 
  Meanwhile, these bourses are trying to develop futures 
trading in line with international conventions by drawing up 
regulations, training qualified brokers and employing 
computerization. 
  To serve the markets, various intermediary offices have 
sprouted up, covering accounting, auditing, consultancy and law.

municipal government will help reinforce major enterprises and 
enliven small ones this year, a local official in charge of

management authority of state-owned assets from the state on a 
trial basis this year; select 10 enterprises to try out the

socialist market economy.

  [Text] Guangzhou, January 18 (XINHUA) -- South China's 
Guangdong Province, formerly regarded as a `cultural desert', 
has made great efforts to boost fine arts to help it keep pace 
with the province's rapid economic development. 
  The reform and opening drive has made Guangdong an economic 
giant in the country. But its cultural development has long 
lagged behind, with pop music and vulgar video shows flooding 
this southern province. 
  To establish a better image, Guangdong has decided to 
elevate 
the fine arts, as stated by Xie Fei, governor of Guangdong 
Province. 
  Since 1991, the provincial government has stipulated that 
three percent of revenues from ballrooms, karaoke clubs and pop 
music concerts be collected as special funds for the creating 
and performing of serious and folk arts. 
  Subsidies are provided to performing troupes of serious 
music, folk song and dance, theater and local opera. 
  Recently, Guangdong has earmarked huge sums to host varied 
art festivals, build performing and exhibition halls and improve 
all kinds of arts facilities. 
  Frequent large-scale art festivals, such as the 
international 
dance festival, the international Guangdong opera festival, and 
the Guangdong art festival, have effectively promoted the fine 
arts and enlarged cultural exchanges with foreign counterparts. 
  The foundation of the Guangzhou music hall has been laid, 
with an estimated investment of 50 million yuan. Construction 
of the Guangdong museum, art gallery, and international 
Guangdong opera center is also speeding up. 
  A symphony fund and provincial ballet ensemble will be set 
up 
soon. 
  The common prosperity of both pop and serious, foreign, and 
folk artistic forms has greatly enriched the life of people in 
Guangdong and further cultivated and improved their tastes in 
serious arts.

  [Text] At the beginning of this year, some commodity 
prices rose in the province. Some people misunderstood that the 
price rises were caused by the new taxation system. On this 
issue, a person in charge of the provincial taxation bureau 
pointed out a few days ago that taxation system reform would not 
cause price hikes and that localities should take measures to 
stop the practice of raising commodity prices at will. 
  The person in charge cited some examples to explain this 
problem. The new taxation system preserves enterprises' previous 
tax rates. Apart from this, to reduce fluctuations resulting 
from taxation system reform, the state has worked out a 
necessary transitional policy. Therefore, it is groundless to 
think that the new taxation system has caused a new tax burden 
on enterprises or price hikes. Why did some commodity prices 
rise? This person said that some tax payers did not act 
properly and some people even purposely raised their commodity 
prices by taking advantage of taxation system reform. 
Therefore, the person in charge of the provincial taxation 
bureau hoped that people in all circles would supervise this 
malpractice and report it promptly.

  [Text] Guangzhou, January 18 (XINHUA) -- The customs bureau 
of south China's Guangdong Province has improved its inspection 
measures, speeding up entry and exit. 
  The electronic body scanners and luggage security checks in 
the main customs posts in Guangzhou, Kowloon and Jiangmen have 
given way to two new passages, known as the "red passage" and 
the "green passage". 
  Under the new rules, customs formalities for travelers going 
through the "red passage" take a maximum of three minutes, while 
passengers having nothing to declare can go through the "green 
passage" without examination. 
  According to the bureau, the new rules stipulate that random 
luggage examination will replace universal examinations. 
  Officials said that the measures, first tried out in the 
Luohu and Zhongshan customs of the province, have brought China 
closer to the established international practices in the field. 
  Starting January 20, the simplified customs formalities will 
be officially implemented in the province's customs posts at 
Guangzhou, Kowloon, Gongbei, Shantou, Wangpu, Jiangmen and 
Zhanjiang. 
  Statistics show that the daily number of travellers going 
through the province's customs has increased from less than 
20,000 in the early 1980s to the current 200,000, some 80 
percent of the country's total.

wage and salary system, which opened on 11 January, are to plan 
and assign personnel work for 1994, with the focus placed on 
reforming the wage and salary system; to step up the 
establishment of a civil service system, wage and salary system 
reform, and other reforms in the region; and to gradually 
establish a personnel administration structure which suits the 
socialist market economic structure. 
  Yuan Zhengzhong, a member of the standing committee of the 
regional party committee and executive vice chairman of the 
regional government, attended and addressed the meeting. 
[passage omitted] 
  In 1994, this region is to actively and conscientiously 
introduce the national civil service system. The region's aim 
is to build up a basic framework of the civil service system in 
three years and to gradually perfect this system thereafter. 
All service units must change their existing personnel 
administrative patterns; they should be distinguished from 
government organs in terms of administrative structure, 
personnel system, and wage and salary system; and they are to 
establish a personnel system with distinct characteristics which 
is specially designed for service units. Meanwhile, a modern 
enterprise personnel system will be gradually established as 
well. 
  In 1994, as far as the income distribution system is 
concerned, this region is to establish different wage and salary 
systems and normal pay-rise mechanisms corresponding to 
different characteristics of government organs and service 
units, and to introduce a series of reforms in such fields as 
social security and the human resources market.

  [Text] A provincial meeting on economic work opened in 
Zhengzhou yesterday morning. 
  During the meeting, Governor Ma Zhongchen confirmed that the 
general guiding idea for economic work in the province this year 
is to strive for overall development on all fronts, make 
breakthroughs at key links, speed up the establishment of the 
new structure of a socialist market economy, expedite 
development with reform, speed up development through opening 
up, adjust the production structure, improve economic returns, 
develop all economic sectors, explore new areas of economic 
growth, correctly handle the relationship between reform, 
development, and stability, and ensure sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development. 
  Vice Governor Fan Qinchen presided over yesterday's meeting. 
  Provincial party and government leaders present at the 
meeting were Li Changchun [provincial party secretary], Ren 
Keli, Song Zhaosu, Wu Guangxian, Zheng Zengmao, Song Guochen, 
Zhang Deguang, (Ma Jianzhang), Zhang Wenbin, Zhong Lisheng, Li 
Chengyu, Zhang Honghua, Yu Jiahua, Yao Zhongmin, Hu Shujian, and 
Yao Ruxue. 
  In his speech, Governor Ma Zhongchen first made a basic 
appraisal of the province's economic performance in 1993. He 
said that in 1993, inspired by the important remarks made by 
Comrade Xiaoping during his southern tour and the spirit of the 
14th CPC National Congress, our province made new progress in 
reform and opening up and maintained a good trend of economic 
development. The province's GDP totaled 145 billion yuan, an 
increase of 15.2 percent over the previous year; gross 
industrial output value totaled 224 billion yuan [figure as 
heard], an increase of 25 percent; the sales volume contributed 
by industrial enterprises at and above township level totaled 
142 billion yuan, an increase of 21 percent; gross agricultural 
output value totaled 61.5 billion, an increase of 9.8 percent; 
the gross output value of township and town enterprises totaled 
195 billion, an increase of 62.5 percent; gross grain output 
exceeded 35 billion kg, an increase of more than 10 percent and 
hitting an all-time high; peasants' per-capita net income 
amounted to 660 yuan, an increase of 72 yuan; the province's 
financial revenue totaled 13.79 billion yuan, an increase of 
32.5 percent; and the natural growth of population is expected 
to be kept beneath set limits as predicted, thus the strategic 
target of higher economic growth and lower population growth was 
reached. 
  Governor Ma Zhongchen then elaborated on the guiding idea 
for 
economic work and enumerated the main relevant tasks. He said 
that this year is important year for our efforts to speed up the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure, a year 
which will see overall progress on all fronts in reform, 
breakthroughs at key links, and the most vigorous enforcement of 
the coordinated reform package, and it is also a crucial year 
for our efforts to fulfill the goals set by the Eighth Five-Year 
Plan. The main targets of our economic work this year are for 
GDP to increase by 10 percent over last year, gross agricultural 
output value to increase by 3.5 percent, gross industrial output 
value to increase by 18 percent, foreign trade and exports to 
increase by 11 percent, local financial revenue to increase by 
6.5 percent, the margin of increase in the volume of retail 
sales to be kept around 10 percent, and the natural rate of 
population growth to be kept below 11 per thousand, with the 
target set at 10 per thousand. 
  Governor Ma Zhongchen said: As far as the general planning 
of economic work this year is concerned, we are to promote 
development with reform, and the general program of reform is to 
strive for progress on all fronts with breakthroughs at key 
links. He particularly mentioned eight tasks: 1) Speeding up 
the establishment of a modern enterprise system and striving 
hard to improve the economic returns of industrial enterprises; 
2) comprehensively carrying out reform of the finance and 
taxation system and making great efforts to explore more 
financial sources; 3) carrying out in-depth reform of the 
banking system and striving hard to raise funds and use funds in 
a more cost-effective way; 4) doing a good job in reform of the 
planning and investment system and strengthening and improving 
macroeconomic regulation and control; 5) speeding up reform of 
the foreign trade structure and expanding the process of opening 
up to the outside world more boldly; 6) speeding up the growth 
of a market system with the development of production factors 
markets as the key link; 7) establishing and perfecting the 
income distribution and social security system and ensuring a 
satisfactory living standard for the people; and 8) actively, 
steadily, and properly advancing price reform and keeping the 
general price level under strict control. 
  To conclude, Governor Ma Zhongchen asserted that as far as 
economic work this year is concerned, it is necessary to 
correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, 
and stability; the relationship between overall progress on all 
fronts and breakthroughs at key links; the relationship between 
the effort to bring the market's functions into play and the 
improvement of macroeconomic regulation and control; the 
relationship between the interests of the state, the collective, 
and the individual; and the relationship between the development 
of the two civilizations. By doing so, we will make new 
contributions to ensure good and rapid economic development in 
this province.

  [Text] Wuhan, January 17 (XINHUA) -- The labor departments 
of Hubei Province in central China are improving their service 
for the outflow of superfluous laborers and diverting them onto 
a correct track. 
  Hubei, a major agricultural province, has abundant extra 
labor. Last year nearly 800,000 rural people left their homes to 
hunt for jobs elsewhere. 
  To enhance labor management, an overall labor export 
management network has been set up across the province, with 
more than 700 employment service centers which are responsible 
for surveys relating to rural labor resources, basic training 
and establishing contacts with enterprises short of workers. 
  So far, the province has set up over 110 training centers 
which run short-term training classes covering nearly 100 types 
of work. 
  To reduce the haphazardness of labor exports, the province 
has made efforts to improve its information service to supply 
appropriate workers to enterprises in the economically vibrant 
southern China provinces like Guangdong and Hainan. 
  In addition, the province has began to arrange for laborers 
to go abroad for job opportunities -- chiefly people engaged in 
medical, mechanical and manual services. 
  On the other hand, a lot of experienced laborers are 
returning home to start their own businesses. 
  Provincial government officials said the province is also 
reforming its own labor employment by improving its social 
security system and fostering a healthy labor market.

  [Text] In 1993 Hubei's steel output reached 7.2 million 
metric tons -- breaking the 7 million metric ton barrier for the 
first time -- and its total steel out put reached 106.45 million 
metric tons since the founding of the PRC, breaking the record 
of 100 million metric tons. Recent statistics also indicate 
that local steel output reached 1.15 million metric tons, the 
output of 10 nonferrous metals amounted to more than 100,000 
metric tons, and gold output fulfilled the annual plan two 
months earlier. Steel trades and undertakings gained a sales 
income of 22.8 billion yuan, an increase of 42.5 percent over 
the previous year, materialized profits and taxes of 4.5 billion 
yuan, an increase of 67.3 percent, and gained profits of 1.89 
billion yuan, an increase of 113 percent. Hubei's steel output 
ranked third in the country last year. 
  In 1993, metallurgical undertakings throughout the province 
flexibly adjusted their production mix in accordance with market 
demands. Take local metallurgical trades as an example. Last 
year, when steel was selling well, metallurgical undertakings 
throughout the province still put quality first and 94.2 percent 
of their products were up to standards. In the meantime, they 
also ensured the implementation of state procurement contracts 
and supported the construction of the three gorges project, the 
Beijing-Kowloon railway, and the Geheyuan hydropower station.

  [Text] Financial departments in our province have 
strengthened their management and made good achievements 
unparalleled in history. As learned, in 1993 the province's 
revenues topped 10 billion yuan, an increase of 3.37 billion 
yuan over the previous year, which is 36.4 percent. 
  At a provincial financial work meeting yesterday, Governor 
Chen Bangzhu and Vice Governor Chu Bo fully confirmed their 
achievements. Early last year, influenced by stock and real 
estate fever, there were serious outflows of funds from the 
province to other provinces. Apart from this, other factors also 
restricted the province's revenues. During the first five 
months, the province registered a fall in its revenue. To 
tackle this problem, governments and financial departments at 
all levels throughout the province assigned pertinent financial 
task to the grass-roots level. To strengthen tax collection and 
management, beginning in the second half of last year, financial 
and taxation departments in the province began to stop 
provisional tax exemptions. In the course of carrying out a 
general taxation, financial, and price inspections, funds in 
violation of discipline totaling 580 million yuan were 
discovered. In the course of strengthening tax collection and 
management, financial and taxation departments in the province 
also vigorously carried out an improvement of financial 
resources. Last year the number of counties and cities topping 
100 million yuan in revenues increased from the previous five to 
14, and the number of townships and towns which topped 10 
million yuan in revenue increased from eight in the previous 
year to 33.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--A monthly 
report on the economic situation issued by the State Statistics 
Bureau today shows that, in December 1993, the growth rate of 
China's industrial production increased considerably; commodity 
sales in the domestic market were brisk; the range of rise of 
commodity prices was relatively wide; and the pressure of 
inflation increased. 
  Because many more loans were granted in the third and fourth 
quarters last year, the situation of enterprises being short of 
funds was eased. In December, the growth rate of industrial 
production across the country increased considerably, showing an 
increase by 29.8 percent as compared with the same month in the 
previous year and close to the highest point before the work of 
macro regulation and control was strengthened. 
  Sales were brisk in the domestic market. In December, the 
total volume of social commodity retail sales was 35.3 percent 
higher than the same month in the previous year and was up 29.7 
percent over November last year. The volume of grain, edible 
oil, and household electric appliance sales increased sharply. 
That month, the sale of grain was 1.41 million tonnes over the 
same month of the previous year, constituting a sharp contrast 
with the accumulated decline of 18 percent in the volume of 
sales during the first 11 months. Sales of color television 
sets were up 82.1 percent over the same month of the previous 
year. The volume of sales of cassette recorders and 
refrigerators also increased by a relatively large margin. The 
sales of the means of agricultural production began to increase, 
and sales of commodities such as chemical fertilizer, 
pesticides, and plastic for agricultural use also increased 
greatly. 
  The range of the rise of commodity prices in December was on 
the high side. Daily living expenses in 35 large and medium 
cities rose by 23.9 percent, of which the prices of consumer 
goods rose by 17.2 percent and service charges by 38.6 percent. 
Inflationary pressure increased further. 
  On the whole, the situation of economic operations is 
basically normal at present. In the next stage, it will be 
necessary to do a good job in work to give explanation to 
reform, improve the operation of reform, and make efforts to 
guard against marked inflation while ensuring the smooth 
progress of reform in various aspects.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chen Xiao: "China To Tighten Credit"] </F>
  [Text] After months of relaxation, China is again 
tightening the credit corset to stop prices rising. The central 
government is moving to maintain the economic upturn which could 
be jeopardized by runaway inflation. 
  Vice-premier and governor of the central bank Zhu Rongji 
told 
a national work conference last Saturday that the country must 
stick to the tight money policy introduced last July. 
  However, runaway inflation caused by overheated growth, will 
severely damage the work done so far. Moreover, high inflation 
will also cause social distress and instability. 
  Some economists and politicians believe the government 
should 
keep economic growth this year at around 9 percent. 
  They say China should extend the time limit to achieve its 
target. 
  Early in September last year, economists warned of the 
consequences of loosened credit policies. 
  The central government had introduced measures to enhance 
its 
economic control, especially over credit, when the economy began 
to overheat -- a problem characterized by chaos in banking and 
double- digit inflation. 
  Although the trouble in the banking world, such as rampant 
fund- raising and inter-bank lending, has largely been ironed 
out in recent months, the monster of high inflation still looms 
over the economy. 
  Zhu's speech at the weekend aimed to reinforce central 
government moves to squeeze the money supply and halt price 
hikes, which haunted the grain market at the end of last year, 
triggering a buying spree in big cities. 
  State Price Information Centre said the cost-of-living index 
in 35 large cities hit 23.5 percent last December compared with 
the same month of the previous year. 
  One root cause of the increasing inflation was excessive 
investment in fixed assets. 
  In the State sector in the second half of last year it grew 
by around 65 percent compared with the same period the previous 
year (see chart 1). 
  And from September, the banks began to take their feet off 
the brakes on the money supply to meet State-owned enterprises' 
increasing pleas for working capital. 
  Most State enterprises have to rely on bank loans and at 
time 
of economic retrenchment they must slow production almost to a 
halt. 
  To keep the engines of State-owned enterprises working, 
banks 
increased their loans of working capital to industry to 68.9 
billion yuan ($8 billion) between September and November last 
year. The equivalent figure in 1992 was only 25.2 billion yuan 
($2.9 billion), said the State Statistics Bureau. 
  On this point, bankers say they would rather make loans to 
governments to establish a social security system than to throw 
money into propping up often-inefficient State enterprises. 
  Moves to bring annual urban inflation back under 15 percent, 
5 percentage points lower than last year, will also depend on 
support from regional governments, which have a much greater and 
selfish desire to speed up their economies. 
  Some regions and departments are again blindly opening 
investment projects, some of which violate State policies, said 
a front-page commentary on Sunday in People's Daily [RENMIN 
RIBAO], the leading newspaper of the country. 
  The newspaper called on regional governments to quell the 
renewed real estate fever which is developing again in some 
regions after a temporary lull. 
  In 1992, the huge amounts of money invested in real estate 
were one of the chief factors that put the economy into the 
frying pan. 
  It will be much easier to keep the economy growing at a 
sustained pace, while fending off inflation, if regional 
governments take more consideration of the country as a whole.

  [Text] Beijing, January 19 (CNS) -- Chinese consumers will 
be seen to spend their money in five main ways in the coming 
years, according to the State Information Centre. 
  First, residents will purchase apartments and housing will 
become their biggest durable consumption item. Second, people 
will invest in a small family car. Already a number of 
better-off families have bought a family vehicle. Third, while 
telephones have now become common in ordinary households, 
mini-computers will become their popular asset in the future. 
Fourth, people will tend to spend more on promotion of their 
health. Fifth, savings deposits will be increasingly turned 
into investments in stocks and bonds.

  [Text] Beijing, January 19 (CNS) -- China showed a rapid 
pace in economic system reform last year and made important 
progress in certain fields, the Vice Minister of the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economy, Mr. Hong Hu, said 
today at a press conference. 
  Mr. Hong said that the decision reached at the 3rd session 
of 
the Central Committee of the 14th National Congress of the 
Communist Party of China made the goal and basic principle of 
the economic system reform which was confirmed at the 14th 
National Congress systematic and achievable. It helped form a 
basic framework for the socialist market economy system and 
China is now turning its attention towards this system in its 
ongoing work. 
  Mr. Hong summed up the reform carried out last year by 
listing several points. First, the restructuring of the 
enterprise system was accelerated and entered a new stage. 
Regulations on a change in the management mechanism were 
further implemented, the shareholding practice was developed on 
a trial basis while association as well as merging of 
state-owned enterprises registered new progress. 
  Second, a decisive step was taken in price reform while the 
market for production means developed at a faster pace with the 
initial formation of a mechanism where the market decides the 
price. 
  Third, the implementation of the 16 measures on the 
strengthening of macroeconomic regulation centered on the 
application of economic methods had good results, creating sound 
conditions for the implementation of further reform this year. 
  Fourth, opening to the outside world expanded further and a 
new wave of foreign investment in China was seen. A 
comprehensive and high-level opening pattern was basically 
formed. 
  Fifth, social security and rural reform went further and was 
more intensive. New progress was made in housing reform and in 
trial comprehensive reform at the county level. The 
supplementary urban reform which took the lead in the formation 
of a new system showed a good start. 
  Sixth, the build-up of economic laws and regulations was 
speeded up and a significant step was taken in the establishment 
of the legal system for the socialist market economy. The 
standing committee of the National People's Congress approved 20 
ordinances and 13 decisions related to legal matters last year.

  [Text] Beijing, January 19 (CNS) -- The Vice Minister of 
the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, Mr. Hong Hu, 
has made public the economic system reform set for this year. 
  The State Council will single out 100 state-owned 
enterprises 
of medium and large size for trial practice in setting up a 
modern enterprise system which is considered important to China. 
The management mechanism of these enterprises will see a change 
while state-owned small-sized enterprises will be renovated by 
means of leasing, contracting and sale. Those having long-term 
loss will be declared bankrupt. 
  Key to the reform of taxation will lay in the setting up of 
systems for central and local taxation. The relationship 
between the central authorities and localities, the state and 
enterprises and individuals must be made clear in terms of 
taxation. 
  As for monetary reform, the functions of the central bank 
have to be improved and strengthened. The central bank must 
keep control over the supply of money in order to maintain 
stability of the currency. A banking system for the 
policy-oriented banks must be set up in a bid to turn the 
professional banks into state-owned commercial banks. 
  The planned system will also come under reform, putting an 
emphasis on simplification and reducing the number of planned 
indicators but increasing to a little extent the indicators for 
macroeconomic general volume. The mandatory plans for 
production, circulation and distribution will be shrunken. The 
system for order-taking will be developed and improved. 
  Reform of the investment pattern will put an emphasis on the 
strengthening of the status held by enterprises as the main 
investment bodies and the scope of investment by the government 
must be made clear. The responsibility of taking risks in 
investment by legal persons and in credit by banks will be 
established. 
  Mr. Hong pointed out that price reform had not yet been 
completed. He added that a grain and food system in line with 
the socialist market economy system had to be set up as soon as 
possible this year while at the same time a unified price system 
for production means had to be carried out. Prices for coal 
would continue to open to the market and those for crude oil, 
finished oil and electricity were to be adjusted.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "Audits To Focus on </F>
Revenues, Tax Returns"] 
  [Text] As China embarks on bold new economic reforms the 
country's auditors are focusing attention on the key financial 
sectors to ensure money flows in the right directions. 
  Top priorities will be tax returns, government revenues and 
expenditures, and keeping track of banks and other financial 
organizations according to Lu Peijian, Auditor-General of the 
State Auditing Administration (SAA). 
  Lu said emphasis will also be placed on auditing enterprises 
and investments in construction and agriculture. 
  "Auditing must be strengthened this year, a key year for 
China's reform and economic development, to ensure reforms are 
implemented smoothly," Lu told a national auditing conference 
which opened yesterday in Beijing. 
  To back up the "tax-sharing system," which refers to the 
division of taxes between the central and provincial 
governments, the audits of local governments' final fiscal 
accounts in 1993 will focus on whether their revenues and 
expenditures are accurate since the new system will use 1993 
figures as their base, Lu said. 
  Auditors will also keep a closer eye on the central bank and 
policy bank's management of State assets to support financial 
reform. 
  Meanwhile, during the commercialization of existing 
specialized banks, it will be the auditors' job to ensure that 
no State properties are lost in the course of restructuring. 
  In addition, Lu said about one-third of the country's key 
construction projects will be inspected annually for financial 
irregularities. 
  Auditors will also try to examine every project which has 
been completed. 
  He said project reviews are aimed at strengthening 
management 
of the country's investments, improving economic performance and 
keeping costs low. 
  Lu said the inspection of State enterprises will focus on 
the 
preservation and growth of State assets. 
  When auditing Sino-foreign joint ventures, emphasis will be 
placed on assessments of State assets, he said. 
  In addition, to ensure that the country's investment in 
agriculture is correctly spent, State auditors will pay 
particular attention to the expenditure of funds this year, he 
said. 
  Lu said that during 1993 auditing departments across the 
country placed more attention to public finance, money markets 
and key construction projects. 
  He said the auditing of local governments' revenues and 
expenditures and reviews of illegal interbank borrowing have 
helped the country rectify financial order and control the size 
of capital investment. 
  More than 182,000 units were audited last year and 3.392 
billion yuan ($389.9 million) found to be illegally earned 
through violations of financial regulations has been turned over 
to the State, he said. 
  Meanwhile, a total of 11.95 billion yuan ($1.374 billion) 
has 
been saved through recovering misused funds and curtailing 
expenditures. 
  The figure was 5.204 billion yuan ($598 million) more than 
the previous year's figure.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Boom Time for Private Firms"] </F>
  [Text] The pace of China's economic reforms will switch 
from a run to a sprint as the government implements and plans 
more major reform packages. 
  One of the groups to benefit most will be the private 
sector, 
said Yang Dakan of the State Planning Commission's Economic 
Research Institute. 
  In an article in China Business Times he predicted sustained 
growth in the private sector, particularly among hi-tech 
enterprises who will also face ever-fiercer competition. 
  The number of self-employed businesses (those with fewer 
than 
eight workers) will continue to grow, he said. 
  He believes there will be 19 million self-employed 
businesses, a rise of 12 percent over 1993. They will take on 
32 million workers, about 15 per cent more than last year. 
  Their contracted capital will be 79 billion yuan ($9 
billion), an increase of 35 percent over last year. And their 
retail sales volume will be about 200 billion yuan ($23 
billion), compared with 140 billion yuan ($16 billion) last year. 
  While self-employed businesses benefit the national economy, 
their bosses are feeling the pressure of increasingly fierce 
competition. 
  Moreover, State and collectively-owned enterprises, growing 
more vigorous under the latest reforms, will also be a big 
challenge, said Yang. 
  According to a survey conducted by the State Committee for 
Reconstructing the Economic System, people in the private sector 
said competition was their biggest challenge. 
  The only way to survive the battle is to invest more in 
their 
businesses and improve the quality of their service. 
  Yang believed self-employed business people will increase 
their in vestment to record levels in 1994. 
  In the late 1980s, when the country's first individual 
businesses were founded, most were small street stalls or minor 
transporters. 
  Since 1990, private investment has diversified and private 
scientific and technical service outlets have grown fast. 
  This year many more of these businesses will be set up, said 
Yang. 
  Half of the self-employed business people are concentrated 
on 
the east coast, with far fewer in the vast inland areas. 
  The prospects for the country's private enterprises in 1994 
are bright Yang said. 
  His optimistic prediction is based on two facts. 
  One is that some poorly-managed small State or 
collective-owned enterprises will be leased or sold to 
individuals. 
  The second is that better-trained workers, especially 
hi-tech 
talents will enter the private business sector as the country's 
maturing labour market enables people to switch jobs. 
  In 1994 there will be 370,000 private enterprises employing 
up to 5 million people, Yang predicted. 
  Meanwhile, more hi-tech private enterprises (those with more 
than eight workers) will be set up as more people with higher 
education plunge into the private sector. 
  The development of hi-tech enterprises must be backed by 
massive investment. The contracted investment of private 
enterprises will hit 200 billion yuan ($23 billion) this year, 
two and half times more than last year, said Yang. 
  As a result, private hi-tech joint ventures and co-operation 
will boom. 
  Increasing investment will produce increasing profits. Yang 
predicted the average assets of private enterprises will be 
370,000 yuan ($42,000), and the average output value will rise 
to 100,000 yuan ($11,500) with an average sales volume of 70,000 
yuan ($8,000). 
  But while the private sector will be more flexible in 
management, a development gap is to emerge between the rich east 
and poor west, Yang said. 
  In cities and towns, there will be 270,000 private 
enterprises by the end of 1994, doubling last year's figure, 
while 100,000 will be scattered in rural areas, only 20 percent 
more than 1993. 
  Similarly, the imbalance between the east and west of the 
country will widen, Yang predicted.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "WB Loans To Keep Coming"] </F>
  [Text] The World Bank will continue to remain an important 
source of long-term capital for China's economic development, a 
senior official with the world body said. 
  Pieter P. Bottelier, head of the bank's China branch, said 
China has done a "very good" job implementing World Bank loans. 
  Making his remarks in a recent interview with China Daily, 
Bottelier said the bank's total lending to China is projected to 
reach $19 billion by the middle of this year. 
  The international organization has lent $17 billion to China 
since it first made a loan in 1981. 
  Last year, China received the largest amount of World Bank 
funds of any country in the world. 
  New annual commitments are to total over $3 billion with 
projects concentrated in infrastructure construction, social 
development and environmental protection. 
  The bank's lending programme for the coming years, Bottelier 
said, is to be around $3 to 3.5 billion, with about 15 to 17 
projects annually. They are to focus on agriculture and 
removing transportation and energy "bottlenecks." 
  Lending to bolster industry enterprises reform, urban 
development and alleviating poverty are also to receive greater 
emphasis. 
  Bottlier said the World Bank, in addition to being a source 
of capital for China, also provides technical and policy advice 
through economic studies and technical assistance projects. 
  He said assistance programmes this year and in coming years 
will focus on developing the legal system, financial sector and 
fiscal administration. 
  The bank official also noted that Chinese companies are 
winning more international contracts under World Bank loans to 
other countries. 
  This shows that Chinese contractors are becoming more 
competitive in the international economy, he said. 
  Chinese suppliers secured about 3.3 percent of international 
World Bank contracts in 1992, compared with none five years ago. 
About 8 percent of contracts in 199's were awarded to Japanese 
firms. 
  Bottelier also said the World Bank is very pleased with the 
quality of its relationship with China, which is regarded as a 
long- term co-operation project. "The World Bank is expected to 
help deepen and accelerate China's economic reform programme 
announced at the Third Plenary of the 14th Central Committee of 
the Communist Party of China in November last year," he said. 
  However, he said the relative contribution of the bank's 
capital will inevitably diminish as other sources of capital, 
especially the private foreign capital, becomes more important 
for China.

  [Text] Yichang, January 24 (XINHUA) -- China is looking for 
international co-operation in designing and producing huge 
generators for the Three Gorges project. 
  The project, in central China's Hubei Province, started last 
year and is scheduled to be completed in the coming 17 years; 
the 11th year will see the first set of generators producing 
electricity. 
  A group of 26 water turbo-generators for the project are 
planned to have an installed capacity of 700,000 kw each. They 
will be among the biggest in the world when they are installed. 
  To pave the way for international co-operation for the 
project's generators, a month-long symposium was held late last 
year, with more than 90 Chinese and foreign experts taking part. 
  Many leading foreign companies with experience in building 
power- generation equipment above 600,000 kw were represented, 
including the Volth and Siemens companies of Germany, G.E. of 
Canada, Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsui of Japan, and LMZ and 
Electrical of Russia.

  [Text] Beijing, January 21 (XINHUA) -- China has once again 
demonstrated its resolution of developing domestic gold industry 
by using overseas funds and technologies. 
  The China National Gold Corporation (CNGC), the only 
specialized gold industry company in the country, has set up a 
special group to coordinate experimental work of importing 
overseas funds and technologies. 
  Cui Lan, chairman of the board of the CNGC, disclosed that 
so 
far a dozen companies from the U.S., Canada, Australia and South 
Africa have contacted them, showing interest in investing in 
China's gold mines. 
  He said that, besides opening the gold industry to overseas 
investment, China is now putting equal efforts into introducing 
advanced technologies for prospecting, mining, dressing and 
smelting, as well as models for running gold mines and means of 
collecting funds. 
  Cui pointed out that the rumor that China bans overseas 
investors from its gold industry is false. 
  He explained that China's gold industry has made great 
strides since the government adopted the reform and opening-up 
policy in the late 1970s. 
  The country's gold production capability has been raised 
five 
times since then. 
  Altogether there are 28 enterprises directly subordinate to 
the company, which also has nine joint ventures or share-holding 
companies. 
  So as to help China's gold industry move into the world 
market, the company has established four overseas branches. 
  As a group company monopolizing the country's gold industry, 
the CNGC has a large business scope covering prospecting, 
engineering design, construction of gold-related enterprises, 
consultancy, dressing, processing and sales of gold, and 
importing materials, machinery and technologies. 
  Cui foresaw that in the near future the CNGC will develop 
into a trans-regional group investment company.

Up"] 
  [Text] China will build the machinery industry into one of 
the pillars of the national economy, the minister of the 
Machinery Industry said yesterday. 
  Making his remarks at the opening of the industry's national 
conference, He Guangyuan said the industry will keep growing at 
a rate of 13 to 14 percent annually through the end of the 
century. 
  By 2010, he said, the machinery industry will account for a 
third of the nation's industrial output value . 
  Basic machinery and their components, power generators and 
automobiles will be the industry's priorities, he added. 
  According to the latest statistics, the machinery industry's 
output value was 364.5 billion yuan ($41.9 billion) last year, a 
24.6 percent increase over the previous year. 
  Profits and taxes jumped 30 percent to reach 32.5 billion 
yuan ($3.7 billion) and exports of machinery products exceeded 
$14 billion last year. 
  The industry produced 1.28 million automobiles last year, 
including 234,000 sedans, representing an increase of 20 percent 
and 44 percent respectively over 1992. 
  The minister said this year's investment, financial and tax 
reforms will present the industry with new opportunities and 
challenges. 
  The establishment of the national import and export bank, he 
said, will increase machinery exports, particularly complete 
equipment. 
  However, the money shortage will continue to be tight as 
more 
enterprises resort to commercial loans for technical renovations. 
  The new taxation system will make enterprises compete on an 
equal footing. 
  The unification of the dual-track foreign exchange system 
will help expand exports but make imports more expensive, he 
said. 
  And the country's auto assembling factories that depend on 
imported parts will face higher costs because of the devaluation 
of renmenbi. 
  Economists predict that the machinery industry will grow 12 
to 15 percent this year. 
  The planned auto output is 1.4 million this year, including 
340,000 sedans. 
  Continued rapid growth in fixed assets investment this year 
will be the driving force of the industry. 
  But inadequate transport and the shortage of capital, energy 
and raw materials will still pose problems. 
  He said the ministry will adopt bolder corporate reforms 
this 
year to push enterprises to the market. 
  More companies will be restructured into shareholding ones 
and be listed at domestic and overseas securities exchanges.

<F P=106> ["Review and Prospects" column by staff reporter Lu Mu (7627 </F>
3668): "Steel: From 8 Million to 88 Million"; first three 
paragraphs are RENMIN RIBAO editor's note] 
  [Text] The year 1994 has arrived while news of success 
keeps pouring in for us. Often, news of success does not come 
without statistical figures. A series of figures illustrates 
the brilliant achievements our country has made in socialist 
economic construction since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee, especially since Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping gave his talks during his South China tour and since 
the 14th National CPC Congress was held. 
  Figures are most eloquent. Comparing figures is revealing. 
Longitudinal comparison shows us how much progress we have made 
in real terms, while lateral comparison reveals how much we are 
still behind the developed nations. 
  To help our broad readership understand the rich contents of 
figures, we open a new column, "Review and Prospects," today. 
In this column, we will use past data and current statistics to 
illustrate how difficult it has been for us to achieve what we 
have achieved and to throw some light on the arduous nature of 
our future tasks. We truly face heavy tasks and have a long way 
to go. We trust that such comparisons will spur us further 
ahead in reform and opening up with full confidence and to 
strive for new victories in the building of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics in a down-to- earth manner. We also 
hope our readers will make requests and offer suggestions so 
that we can run this column well together. 
  In order to promote iron and steel production, the people of 
our country went through an arduous journey full of twists and 
turns. 
  Most of our comrades aged 40 years or above can vividly 
remember how we strived to produce 10.70 million metric tons of 
steel in 1958. At that time, almost everybody, regardless of 
age or sex, joined the effort. In the end, actual output was 
only 8 million metric tons. The victorious newspaper stories 
printed on the right carry the distinct signature of those time. 
  The 35 years between the 8 million metric tons of 1958 and 
last year's 88.676 million metric tons span two significantly 
different periods. 
  In the first 20 years (1958-1978), iron and steel production 
of our country had slow growth. It took 12 years to bring 
output from 10 million tons to 20 million tons; then it took a 
further eight years to increase output from 20 million tons to 
30 million tons. The novel "The Water Margin" tells a story 
about "conquering Zhu's Village after three battles." In our 
iron and steel production front, we also had the experience of 
trying to "conquer '26 million' with three battles." For three 
years in a row from 1974 to 1976, we planned to increase steel 
output to 26 million tons, all to no avail. 
  In the second period of 15 years (1978-1993), with ongoing 
reform and opening up and a spurt of vitality in our national 
economy, it took five years to increase steel output from 30 
million metric tons to 40 million metric tons, three years to go 
from 40 million tons to 50 million tons and another three years 
to go from 50 million tons to 60 million tons, two years for 
output to reach 70 million tons from 60 million tons, and only 
one year to grow from 70 million tons to 80 million metric tons! 
  In these 15 years, not only has iron and steel output 
increased at dramatic rates, progress in variety, quality, and 
technical advancement has also been very fast. In the 1950's 
and 1960's, China could only smelt ordinary carbon steels, but 
in the late 1980's, we could produce all kinds of carbon steels 
and high- temperature, precision, and other kinds of alloy 
steels. Varieties of steel have increased to more than 1,000. 
Smelting techniques and technology have also undergone great 
changes. Before 1974, China's continuous casting ratio was 
zero, but it reached 34 percent last year. 
  Naturally, however, although China has become a big producer 
of iron and steel, we are far from being a competitive producer. 
Annual steel output per worker in our iron and steel industry is 
only 24 metric tons, while the comparable figure in such 
countries as Japan and the ROK is two to three times higher than 
ours. Energy consumption per metric ton of steel in our country 
is 1.5 metric tons of standard coal, which is 50 percent higher 
than the advanced international level. There are even greater 
gaps in terms of variety and quality. Only half of the crucial 
varieties needed by key areas of the national economy are 
supplied internally, and the others still need to be imported. 
Our country's iron and steel industry is now making efforts to 
optimize its structure and narrow the above-mentioned gaps as 
soon as possible.

<F P=106> ["Earnestly Studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of </F>
Deng Xiaoping" column by Wang Senhao, coal industry 
minister: "Reformative Thoughts on Coal Industry Moving Toward 
the Market Economy"] 
  [Text] Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping [Selected Works] is important Marxist 
literature. The book collects important works during the period 
from September 1982 to February 1992. We had personal 
experience and took part in the practice during this period. 
Therefore, we find the selected works intimate and easy to 
read. Centering closely round the main theme of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics from beginning to end, 
the book expounds a series of creative theoretical viewpoints. 
It has enriched and developed Mao Zedong Thought with many new 
ideas and viewpoints and manifests the features of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is China's 
contemporary Marxism and is a brilliant example of upholding the 
ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from 
facts. 
  Using historical materialism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has put 
forward the viewpoint that the productive forces play a decisive 
role in the development of human society and has given creative 
Marxist answers to questions such as the nature of socialism, 
the fundamental tasks of socialism, and the fundamental standard 
for testing various kinds of work. 
  In studying the Selected Works, we must firmly 
grasp the viewpoint that the productive forces play a decisive 
role, abide by the productive forces criteria, and gain a 
thorough understanding of the essence of the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Systematically studying 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics is of great practical significance and 
farreaching historical significance to further increasing 
understanding, adhering to the party's basic line, enhancing 
vigor, doing pioneering work, making progress, and carrying out 
historical missions. 
  The practice in reform and opening up during the past 10 
years and more has shown that the development rate of our 
country has been fast and that the broad masses of the people 
are satisfied with the development rate. Viewed from the 
development of the coal industry, these 10 years and more have 
been a period for the fastest development in the history of the 
coal industry. The output of raw coal increased from 618 
million tonnes in 1978 to 1.115 billion tonnes in 1992. The 
average annual increase was 35.5 million tonnes. After 1986, 
the shortages in coal supplies, which had lasted for many years, 
eased up. Great changes took place in the coal production 
technology and the degree of mechanization was raised by a big 
margin. The degree of mechanization in coal mining in key state 
mines was raised from 32.5 percent in 1978 to 72.26 percent in 
1992. Safety in mines improved annually. The death rate in 
producing 1 million tonnes of coal was lowered from 9.44 people 
in 1978 to 5.43 people in 1992, a decline of 42.5 percent. The 
death rate in producing 1 million tonnes of coal in key state 
mines was lowered from 6.94 people in 1978 to 1.06 people in 
1992, a decrease of 84.7 percent. Relatively great achievements 
were also made in opening up to the outside world and coal 
exports were increased by a big margin. All this has clearly 
proved that Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the policy of reform and opening up 
we have adopted are entirely correct. 
  The coal industry is an important basic industrial sector of 
the national economy and is also the basic industrial sector 
which is most seriously affected by the traditional planned 
economy structure and which has least vitality among state 
enterprises. At a time when the economy is shifting to the new 
economic structure, a large amount of problems left behind by 
the traditional planned economy structure are woven with new 
contradictions and new problems cropping up in the course of 
entering the socialist market economy. This has put coal 
enterprises in a very difficult position. Affected by the 
traditional planned economy structure over a long period, coal 
mines have been run only by coal departments and only coal has 
been produced in coal mines. In the construction of coal mines, 
the scale has been stressed and economic results have been 
belittled. This has led to the emergence of a serious imbalance 
and many other major problems in the total supply and demand of 
coal, production structure, product mix, and the economic 
results of coal enterprises. Such problems mainly include: 
1) The coal industry lacks the capacity for further 
development. By the end of this century, there will be a 
big contradiction between the available coal production capacity 
and the needs of the rapid growth of the national economy. 
2) A big contradiction exists between the production 
structure of the coal industry and the demand structure of the 
national economy. The proportion of rural coal mines has 
become larger and more and more newly-increased coal output is 
produced by scattered, small-scale, and nonregular coal mines. 
This is not in keeping with the gradual concentration of coal 
consumption on power, steel, and chemical enterprises and the 
direction of the development toward large scale and stability. 
It is impossible to have a long-term and steady supply of coal 
to meet the needs of the national economy. 3) There is a 
big contradiction between the possible coal industry output and 
the railroads' and transportation department's possible capacity 
for coal. Since the layout of coal resources and that of 
the productive forces of the national economy are developing in 
opposite directions and the product mix of coal is unitary, the 
coal produced cannot be converted locally, the problem of coal 
transportation has remained unresolved for a long time and many 
coal enterprises do not have the basic conditions for production 
and operation. 4) Key state coal enterprises have an 
excessive number of workers, low productivity, and heavy 
losses. At present, key state coal mines produce over 480 
million tonnes of coal and have a total of 3.6 million workers. 
However, Australia produces more than 200 million tonnes of 
coal, but has 30,000 workers. The difference is nearly 40-fold. 
The gap between our level and the world's advanced level is too 
big. Although these existing contradictions and problems in the 
coal industry at present are expressed as problems of total 
supply and demand, structural readjustment, and economic 
results. In essence, they reflect in a concentrated manner the 
drawbacks of a complete set of policies for production and 
construction in coal mines, investment policies, and the 
operational mechanism of coal enterprises formed in the planned 
economy structure. In resolving these contradictions and 
problems, it is necessary to formulate policies and find a way 
out in reform and to restudy and redesign new ideas, a new 
framework, and new mechanisms for the coal industry to move 
toward the market in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the general 
demand on the establishment of the socialist market economy 
structure put forward in the decision on several questions on 
the establishment of the socialist market economy structure made 
at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
and using as reference the experience in the development of the 
coal industry in foreign countries. I would now like to put 
forward some reformative thoughts and tentative views on how the 
coal industry in China should move toward the socialist market 
economy. 
<H3>  I. Break the Barriers in the Industry, Mobilize the 
Strength of Various Quarters To Run Coal Mines </H3>
  Running coal mines should not be limited to one industry, 
locality, or country and transindustrial, transregional, and 
transnational comprehensive mining companies should be organized 
to carry out comprehensive development and operation. In the 
coming 10 years, the national economy will enter a new period of 
rapid development. How much coal will be needed and what will 
be the production capacity of the coal industry by the end of 
this century? Many domestic and foreign specialists and scholars 
are constantly studying and exploring these questions. The 
Ministry of Coal Industry is also studying and formulating 
development plans. According to tentative views on revitalizing 
the coal industry, put forward by comprehensive state 
departments in 1992 after Comrade Deng Xiaoping made his 
important remarks during his southern tour, the ministry has put 
forward the target of producing 1.5 billion tonnes of coal by 
the end of the century. At present, the coal production 
capacity of the whole country is about 1.1 billion tonnes. By 
the end of this century, the decrease caused by the decline in 
coal production capacity will be about 100 million tonnes. To 
attain a production capacity of 1.5 billion tonnes, more than 
400 million tonnes of newly added production capacity is needed. 
In the short period of seven years, it is not at all easy to 
increase the production capacity by 400 million tonnes and it 
will be difficult for the state to provide the financial 
resources. There is a serious insufficiency in strength for 
further developing the coal mines. Therefore, in addition to a 
number of key mines, built with state investment in a planned 
way, the strength of various quarters should be mobilized and 
funds from various quarters should be pooled to build coal 
mines. Coal mines run by collectives in townships and towns 
should be developed continuously and with great efforts. To 
consolidate, support, reform, combine, and raise to a higher 
level collective coal mines in townships and towns, and to 
comprehensively improve the quality of coal enterprises, have 
become strategic tasks which brook no delay in the development 
of the coal industry in the coming 10 years. Proceeding from 
the reform of the coal distribution system and in accordance 
with the principle of benefiting those who make investment, it 
is necessary to encourage the electricity, metallurgy, chemical 
industry, and railway departments, and enterprises under these 
departments, to make investment in running coal mines and to 
encourage localities which have a shortage of coal to run coal 
mines in localities where coal is abundant. It is necessary to 
welcome and attract foreign coal enterprises, commercial 
companies, and financial firms to make investment and run coal 
mines in China in the form of joint ventures and cooperation. 
Industrial departments should provide high-quality services in 
terms of geology, design, construction, technology, equipment, 
and management, for departments, localities, and domestic and 
foreign enterprises and companies which make investment in coal 
mines and should carry out management by the respective trades. 
It is necessary to make use of the market economy structure to 
resolve the contradiction of the coal industry's lack of 
strength for further development. 
<H3>  II. Break Away From the Traditional Practice of "Allocation 
of Levels" of Construction Scales in Central State-Owned Coal 
Mines; Proceed From the Actual Layout of Coal Resources; Pay 
Attention to the Principle of Economic Results; and Use State 
Funds for the Construction of State-Owned Coal Mines in a 
Relatively Concentrated Manner </H3>
  The state should mainly grasp several key coal export 
provinces and areas and build a number of large energy bases 
which can support the whole country in despatching both coal and 
electricity from regions where coal reserves are abundant, 
conditions are favorable, and the input-output results are good. 
The development, production, and operation of key state-owned 
coal mines in provinces and regions where there is a shortage of 
coal or where coal is for their own use, should, in principle, 
be managed by the provinces or regions. Support should be given 
to provinces and regions which despatch coal in the construction 
of local commodity coal bases, sales of locally produced coal on 
the market, and supply of coal power plants, steel works, and 
other consumers which need large quantities of coal. 
<H3>  III. Break Away From the Traditional Mode That Coal Mines 
Can Only Be Run by Coal Enterprises; Develop Industry for Local 
Processing and Converting Coal to Reduce the Pressure on Coal 
Transportation </H3>
  Because of the imbalance between the location of the coal 
resources and that of the productive forces in the national 
economy, and because of the planned economy structure in the 
past 40 years and more since the founding of the republic, coal 
enterprises can only run coal mines, their product mix is 
unitary, little of the coal produced is converted locally and, 
as a result, the amount of coal transported into or out of 
provinces and regions has increased annually and more and more 
coal is transported out of central and western provinces. In 
1990, the net amount of coal transported out of the central and 
western areas accounted for 80 percent of the whole country's 
total and there has always been a shortage in the coal 
transportation capacity. Therefore, all mining areas with the 
relevant conditions should construct power plants and coking 
plants and should develop other chemical products with the coal. 
Some may make unified plans for coal, electricity, railway, and 
seaports and carry out unified development and comprehensive 
management so that most of the coal can be converted locally, 
the pressure on coal transportation can be reduced, and the 
basic operational conditions for the coal industry's entry into 
the market can be created. 
<H3>  IV. Get Rid of the Traditional Concept of Paying Attention 
to the Scale of Construction While Belittling Economic Results 
and of Spending Money Without Paying Off Debts; Lay Stress on 
Economic Results </H3>
  In building new state-owned coal mines, including major 
technical transformation, it is necessary to use new modes, new 
mechanisms, and a high technological level of equipment, to use 
less people and to obtain better economic results. Coal mines 
with poor conditions or economic results, or without the ability 
to pay off debts, should not be built. In this way, the level 
of the coal-mining equipment and economic results of key 
state-owned coal mines in China will reach, or come close to, 
the international level in 10 to 20 years as a result of our 
efforts. 
<H3>  V. Make Great Efforts To Readjust the Industrial Structure; 
Establish the Strategic Position of Diversified Management </H3>
  The establishment of the socialist market economy structure 
has enabled the coal industry to enter a historical period of 
changes and the problems of an excessive amount of people 
employed, low productivity, poor economic results, and great 
losses are confronting severe challenges. Because of this, the 
coal industry must persistently regard coal as the foundation, 
optimize the industrial structure, and make great efforts to 
develop diversified management and tertiary industry. It is 
necessary to reduce the number of people employed and increase 
economic results. The surplus personnel from the enterprises 
can be used for diversified management and tertiary industry. 
Diversified management covers a wide scope, including 
production and operational activities of the first, second, and 
third industries. For example, processing in depth and 
conversion of coal and the comprehensive development and 
utilization of the resources of mining areas; the development of 
tertiary industry which requires less investment and provides 
more job vacancies; and the development of industries other than 
the coal industry. This is a major strategic measure in the 
development of the coal industry. Not only old mining areas 
should develop diversified management and blaze new paths, new 
mining areas should also develop diversified management and take 
the road of comprehensive development, change the face of 
operations in the coal industry as soon as possible, and 
increase economic results so that coal enterprises can extricate 
themselves from a difficult position. 
<H3>  VI. Change the Operational Mechanism of State-Owned 
Enterprises, Establish a Modern Enterprise System Which Is In 
Keeping With the Requirements of the Socialist Market Economy, 
and Effectively Integrate Enterprises Under Public Ownership 
With the Market Economy </H3>
  In carrying out experiments on establishing a modern 
enterprise system it is necessary to select a number of coal 
enterprises which have a more favorable geological position, 
better conditions in terms of resources, and better economic 
results. Experiments on companies with limited liability can be 
carried out in some of these enterprises and experiments on 
joint-stock companies can be carried out in others. On the 
basis of the experience gained, management and operation by 
companies should be gradually practiced in state- owned coal 
mining enterprises. Relations in property rights should be put 
in order and the ownership of investors should be separated from 
the property rights of legal persons. The ownership of 
investors includes stock ownership, that is, the investors are 
entitled to: Benefit from assets according to law in the 
capacity of stockholders; participate in the selection of 
managers; participatin in major policy decisions; the right to 
transfer stock ownership; and entitled to other rights. The 
legal person property rights include the possession, 
utilization, benefits, handling, and allocation of the property 
of the legal persons according to law and the legal persons are 
responsible for their own operational activities with their 
independent property. Enterprises have the legal person 
property rights and, through the establishment of the capital 
system and the assets management responsibility system, the 
system of assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses 
can really be implemented in enterprises. It is necessary to 
enable enterprises to manipulate, utilize, handle, and operate 
their assets, to make good use of deposited funds, and to 
effectively bring about added value in accordance with the 
relationship of market supply and demand and the law of value. 
In this way, enterprises can put an end to the situation of 
mixing up the duties of the government and those of enterprises, 
lay a foundation for enterprises to stop being appendages of 
government administrative organs, and create the basic 
conditions for government departments to practice management by 
respective trades. Coal enterprises which are not selected for 
experiments should continue to resolutely implement the 
"Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations on Industrial Enterprises 
Under the Ownership of the Whole People Changing Operational 
Mechanism," reform the internal management system, and practice 
replica legal person operation in units under them so that these 
units are entitled to the rights of legal person enterprises 
within the enterprises, undertake the responsibilities of legal 
person enterprises, and embark on the orbit of development "on 
their own in four aspects." Nonproductive and nonconstruction 
units should operate independently, assume sole responsibility 
for profits and losses, find their own way out, and strive to 
survive through moving toward the market. 
<H5>  VII. Increase Coal Exports </H5>
  In 1992, China produced 1.115 billion tonnes of raw coal, of 
which 20.2 million tonnes were exported, accounting for 1.8 
percent of the coal output. This is far from being in keeping 
with a big coal-producing country with an output of 1.1 billion 
tonnes. A major cause is the problem of the export structure. 
The export of coal is only managed by the China National Coal 
Import and Export Corporation and the enthusiasm of various 
other major enterprises, or major coal-producing provinces, is 
not given full play. This situation must be changed and coal 
exports should be a chief source of foreign exchange. It is 
necessary to formulate, in accordance with the requirements of 
the socialist market economy, a set of policies for coal exports 
which are in keeping with our national conditions, and which can 
arouse the enthusiasm of various sectors, and to smash the coal 
export structure which does not conform with the market economy 
laws and in which only one corporation operates. It is necessary 
to remove restrictions in an appropriate way, gradually give key 
coal enterprises the right to make decisions on exports, and 
increase the export volume of coal to earn more foreign exchange 
for the state. To avoid confusion in coal exports, to 
coordinate work in various aspects of coal exporting 
enterprises, and to unify policies toward foreign countries in 
coal exports, the establishment of a China Coal Imports and 
Exports Commercial Chamber can be taken into consideration. 
This chamber can study and formulate policies for coal exports, 
fix the lowest price limit and the range of price fluctuation, 
collect and provide information on the international coal 
markets, and investigate and study the operational activities of 
domestic coal exporting enterprises to increase the competitive 
power of our coal exports, supervise and maintain normal trade 
order, and do a good job in coordinating coal trading activities 
with foreign countries by coal exporting enterprises and in 
providing services for them. 
  At present, we are living amid deep changes following the 
development in reform, opening up, and modernization. The faces 
of the social relationship and social economy are undergoing 
tremendous changes. So long as we earnestly study and use Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, constantly raise our consciousness and firmness 
in implementing the party's basic line, deepen reform, and speed 
up development, the coal industry will certainly have 
flourishing and prosperous prospects.

<F P=106> [By Yu Zuyao (0060 4371 1031) of the Economics Institute of </F>
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, edited by Xiao Yang 
(2556 7122): "The Theoretical Basis for Developing a Socialist 
Market Economy -- Study of Volume 3 of Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping"] 
  [Text] Just as China's socialist economic reform entered 
the crucial moment of accelerating overall structural change, 
the publication and distribution of Volume 3 of Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping have provided a scientific 
theoretical basis and guiding principle for China to draw upon 
and accelerate the overall construction of a socialist market 
economy. Moreover, they have also provided the best teaching 
material for economic circles to study and explore the Marxist 
economics of New China, and provided a scientific guide for us 
in striving to found a socialist market economy. 
  China's socialist reform has gone through a short course, 
but 
its brilliant achievements have gone down in the annals of 
mankind. The initiator of this unparalleled feat is Deng 
Xiaoping. The chief designer of this magnificent edifice of the 
socialist market economy with oriental national style is Deng 
Xiaoping. It can be said without the least exaggeration that 
without the initiative of Comrade Deng Xiaoping there would have 
been no world-shocking changes in China. Without the guidance 
by the brilliant banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics it would have been 
impossible for China's reform to have made great achievements 
that have attracted worldwide attention. At present, China's 
great cause of reform has entered the stage of storming 
fortified positions of overall structural change. The road 
ahead is tough, but the reform cannot stop here, much less 
should we fall back. If we do not make progress, we are falling 
back, and falling back "can only be on the road to ruin." Now 
the targets and direction are clear, the road is open, and the 
plan of decisive battle will soon be put into effect. Under the 
new situation it is absolutely necessary and timely to study 
systematically and seriously Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, especially the 
theory on socialist reform. It can be affirmed that should 
China depart in future reform from the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and should China deviate from the course 
pointed out by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist 
reform, it would be difficult to build up the system of a 
socialist market economy and reform would even be led onto a 
wrong path. 
  The cause of China's socialist reform can only take Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, especially Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist 
reform as the banner and the guiding principle, and should by no 
means take any other theory as guidance. The guiding position 
of this theory of Deng Xiaoping's is not artificially 
established, but is an inevitable selection by history. After 
the victory of the democratic revolution, the Chinese people and 
the CPC went through a difficult and tortuous course, and paid 
huge cost determining how to build socialism in a country like 
China, which was backward in economy, culture, science, and 
technology. Useful explorations were made, too. Early during 
the period of the democratic revolution, proceeding from China's 
national conditions, Comrade Mao Zedong creatively put forward 
the theory on a new democratic society. After the founding of 
the PRC, during the period of the restoration of the national 
economy, we put this theory into practice, rapidly restored the 
national economy destroyed by a protracted war, and smashed the 
imperialist economic blockade, and the people lived and worked 
in peace and contentment. It seems that if we should continue 
making explorations along this idea, the new democratic society 
would probably be a road leading to socialism which we would 
inevitably follow. However, by mid-1950's the pace of 
transition of new democracy was quickened, and it was replaced 
by socialism "large in size and collective in nature." 
Afterward, the Soviet Communist Party's criticism of Stalin 
impelled the CPC to think back on the economic management system 
and the road of industrialization. The Eighth CPC Congress and 
Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Ten Major Relations" challenged the 
Soviet model of socialism, and put forward the considerations of 
reforming the management system. 
  It should be said that in the international communist 
movement, the CPC's consciousness of reform was fairly early. 
If China should continue forging ahead along the road of the 
Eighth CPC Congress, the system of a socialist market economy 
with Chinese characteristics might have stood erect in the East 
long ago. However, this valuable experiment that had just begun 
soon died out, the development of the productive forces was 
replaced by endless political movements and escalation of 
ownership, "take economic construction as the center" was 
replaced by "take class struggle as the key link," and the 
objectively existing market mechanism was replaced by the 
"official's will." The ten-year long turmoil that neither 
wanted culture nor was revolutionary pushed all the more this 
rigid leftist system to the extremes, and declared "exercising 
all-round dictatorship" over commodities, market, and currency 
without exception. Finally, it did great damage to the 
productive forces and the national economy was pushed to he 
brink of collapse. After this unprecedented calamity of 
self-destruction ended, the whole party and the entire Chinese 
people thought seriously: How has this catastrophe has 
happened? How can we prevent its repetition? China was again 
faced with the problem of re-selecting the socialist model: 
Where to go. To go in for "whatever" and continue maintaining 
the old system, line, and policies, or to "seek truth from 
facts, emancipate our minds," and continue exploring the 
socialist road by combining Marxist fundamental tenets with 
China's practical conditions? Precisely at this important 
moment that determined the future and destiny of the party and 
the state, Comrade Deng Xiaoping upheld the brilliant banner of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and sounded the 
advance of all-round reform. Comrade Deng Xiaoping correctly 
summed up the successful experiences, frustrations, and lessons 
of the CPC in exploring the road of building socialism, and drew 
the experiences and lessons of the rise and fall, success and 
failure of other socialist countries, and led the Chinese people 
in the great practices of reform and opening-up to achieve 
another historical leap by combining the Marxist fundamental 
tenets with China's practical conditions of socialist 
construction. It can be said that the theory he founded on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the 
continuation and development of Comrade Mao Zedong's "On New 
Democracy" and "On Ten Major Relations" in the new period. The 
reform he initiated is the direct inheritance and development of 
the reform experiment that the CPC started carrying out in the 
mid-1950's and was later interrupted. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics has 
opened a new chapter in the history of Marxist development. The 
reform he initiated has ushered in a new epoch in the history of 
mankind. 
  Various socialist countries originally carried out the 
administrative mandate-type planned economy system according to 
the Soviet model. This kind of system had considerable 
superiority in mobilizing and concentrating limited resources on 
key construction projects, but lacked life and vitality. Since 
the 1970's, many counties have embarked on the road of reform 
with the market as orientation. There is no precedent yet that 
these countries have achieved success in reform, but on the 
contrary most of them have been bogged down in the quagmire of 
economic, political, and social crisis, and the people have no 
means of livelihood. This "therapy" and that "plan" invented by 
those foreign advisers and "brain trusters" all vanish like soap 
bubbles, and have become bitter fruits which they can neither 
swallow nor spit out. The economy and culture of China are far 
more backward than those of these countries, China's national 
conditions are more complicated, and therefore the difficulty of 
reform cannot be compared by that in these countries. However, 
China's reform has made universally acknowledged achievements. 
  From 1978 to 1992, China's GNP increased from 358.8 billion 
yuan to 2,400 billion yuan, total import and export amount 
increased from 20.6 billion dollars to 165.6 billion dollars, 
per capita income of the peasants increased from 132 yuan to 784 
yuan, per capita income of city and town staff and workers 
increased from 382 yuan to 1,826 yuan, the savings balance of 
urban and rural residents increased from 21.1 billion yuan to 
1,380 billion yuan, and the life of the people is transitioning 
from enough to eat and wear type to comparatively well-off type. 
In the world today, many countries are going through recession 
and crisis, and only China's economy has since reform maintained 
a momentum of powerful and high-speed growth. The reason lies 
precisely in: We uphold "thinking independently and taking our 
own road," firmly believe that "one can never achieve success by 
copying indiscriminately the experiences and the model of other 
countries," and persist in combining the Marxist fundamental 
tenets with China's concrete practices. We have forsaken the 
Eastern dogmatism, and have also guarded against the disruption 
by Western dogmas. We have always placed Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on socialist reform in a position of guiding 
principle for reform. The practices of reform require learning 
from the successful experiences of other countries, and the 
theories of reform should assimilate the scientific composition 
of contemporary Western economics. But learning from and using 
for reference cannot substitute for one's own creation, much 
less can foreign books replace Marxism of New China and serve as 
the guiding principles for China's reform. China must carry out 
reform; if not, "it can only be the road to ruin." China's 
reform can only be guided by the theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, and whenever we run counter to or 
deviate from this theory, reform will go astray. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on China's socialist reform 
is 
a scientific system gradually built up and developed in the 
practices of China's reform. This scientific system is the 
outcome by combining the fundamental tenets of historical 
materialism and scientific socialism with China's practical 
conditions, and has also assimilated the scientific composition 
of contemporary Western economics. It has the characteristics 
of practices, inheritance, openness, systematics, science, and 
criticism. It is rich and profound in contents, and various 
components parts are interrelated and constitute a complete 
scientific system. Only by studying systematically Volume 3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping can we fully 
comprehend Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist reform. Take the 
important parts, for example: Concerning the theory that reform 
must first straighten out the ideological line, uphold 
"emancipating the mind, and seeking truth from facts," proceed 
from China's national conditions in everything, be bold in 
making explorations through practices, and forsake book worship 
of every description, and concerning the dialectical relations 
between reform and upholding the socialist road. On the one 
hand "we must never take the Western capitalist road" in reform, 
and "if China with one billion people should take the capitalist 
road, it would be a disaster to the world, and it is pulling 
history back." On the other hand, if we do not carry out 
reform, "it can only be the road to ruin" and "poverty is not 
socialism." 
  Concerning the theory that reform is the road we must follow 
in emancipating and developing the productive forces. "After 
the establishment of the socialist basic system, it is still 
necessary to change fundamentally the economic system that 
fetters the development of the productive forces," and "reform 
also means liberating the productive forces. In the past, we 
only talked about developing the productive forces under the 
socialist condition, and did not talk about the fact that it was 
still necessary to liberate the productive forces through 
reform. It was incomplete. We should completely talk about 
both liberating and developing the productive forces." With 
regard to the nature of reform, "reform is China's second 
revolution," and "we look upon reform as a kind of revolution, 
of course not the kind of revolution like `the Cultural 
Revolution.'" But "the nature of reform, like that of the 
revolution in the past, is also to remove the obstacles that 
hinder the development of social productive forces." Concerning 
the essence of socialism, "the essence of socialism is to 
liberate the productive forces, develop the productive forces, 
eliminate exploitation, remove polarization, and finally achieve 
common prosperity." About the central task of the socialist 
stage, "the central task of the whole socialist historical stage 
is to develop the productive forces." "To go in for socialism, 
the central task is to develop the productive forces," and we 
must always take economic construction as the center. 
  Concerning the socialist fundamental principles, "one 
principle is that public ownership constitutes the main body, 
and the other is common prosperity. These are the socialist 
fundamental principles we must uphold." Regarding the 
compatibility of socialism with the market economy, and the 
integration of planning with the market, "there is no 
fundamental contradiction between socialism and the market 
economy," and "it is not the essential difference between 
socialism and capitalism whether there is a bit more of planning 
or a bit more of the market. The planned economy is not equal 
to socialism, there is planning too under capitalism; the market 
economy is not equal to capitalism either, there is also the 
market under socialism. Both planning and the market are 
economic means." "Planning and the market that serve socialism 
are socialist; those that serve capitalism are capitalist." 
"Both planning and the market are methods, and can be made use 
of so long as they are advantageous to developing the productive 
forces." With regard to the relations between reform and 
development, "grasp the opportune moment, develop ourselves, and 
the key is to develop the economy," "only development is a tough 
argument," "as long as we talk about performance, about quality, 
and go in for export-oriented economy, there is nothing to be 
worried about," and "China should strive to enter a new stage in 
economic development after every few years. Of course, we 
should not encourage impractical high-speed, but should be 
realistic and pay attention to performance, and make stable and 
coordinated development." "The law of China's economic 
development may still be advancing wave upon wave, with a leap 
and jumping over a new stage after every few years." 
  Regarding the building of material civilization and 
spiritual 
civilization, we should stick to paying attention to dual 
tactics, and both tactics should be tough: "We should oppose 
corruption in the whole process of reform and opening-up." 
Concerning the relations between economic reform and political 
reform, and the tasks of political reform: "Now for every step 
forward made in economic structural reform we deeply feel the 
necessity of political structural reform. Without political 
structural reform we cannot continue making progress in economic 
structural reform, which would obstruct the development of the 
productive forces." "The political structural reform includes 
first of all separating the functions of the party from those of 
the government, and solving the problem of how the party can be 
good at leadership. It also includes decentralization and 
simplification of the administrative structure". "The purposes 
of the political structural reform are: Always maintain the 
vitality of the party and the state; overcome bureaucracy, raise 
working efficiency; mobilize the initiatives of the basic 
levels, and those of the workers, peasant, and intellectuals," 
and "develop the socialist democracy." About expanding opening 
to the outside world, we uphold maintaining independence and 
keeping the initiative in our own hands and self- reliance; 
oppose hegemonism and power politics. Concerning the exposition 
that reform must be carried out under leadership and in an 
orderly manner, and that it is necessary to maintain stability 
and a stable social environment, "to go in for reform and 
opening- up, the key lies in stability," "China's overriding 
problem is stability, and without a stable environment, nothing 
can be achieved;" "for the reform to succeed, it must be carried 
out under leadership and in an orderly manner," and "the central 
authorities must have authority." 
  About the criteria for examining reform, we should uphold 
taking whether or not the reform measures are favorable to 
developing the productive forces of the socialist society, 
enhancing the overall national strength of the socialist 
country, and raising the living standard of the people as the 
basic criteria for deciding which measures to use and their 
success and failure. 
  Moreover, there are also expositions about rural and urban 
reforms. These interrelated aspects constitute the basic 
contents of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the socialist 
reform. This complete scientific system includes the 
theoretical basis and the guiding principle of China's reform, 
its nature and tasks, its strategy selection and measures for 
implementation, its external environment and conditions, and its 
target model and orientation. A red line that runs through this 
scientific system is to achieve through overall reform a linkage 
between the socialist basic system and the operational mechanism 
of the market economy, and to integrate the superiority of the 
socialist system with the basic role of the market economy in 
optimizing resources allocation, thereby pushing the productive 
forces to develop at a rate faster than that under the 
capitalist system, and achieving common prosperity among the 
people. The core of this scientific system is to re-select 
through the second revolution a socialist model that conforms 
with China's national conditions and meets the requirements of 
the productive forces. We should strive to study and put into 
practice Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the socialist reform, 
whether the whole system or a particular thesis, completely and 
not one-sidedly, objectively and not subjectively as one 
pleases, accurately and not quoting out of context, and 
profoundly and not superficially. Otherwise, it will not only 
do harm to the reputation of the theory itself, but will be more 
detrimental to the great cause of reform. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the socialist reform and 
the great practices of China's economic reform have evoked a 
profound revolution in the history of Marxist economic theories, 
and have written a brand new chapter in the Marxist socialist 
economics. The reform is intensifying, and practices are 
developing. This theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's will be 
constantly enriched and become more mature. With this theory as 
the basis, it will be possible for us to found the Marxist 
socialist political economics with Chinese characteristics. 
Only with this theory as guidance will it be possible for us to 
deal with Western economics correctly, assimilate its essence, 
reject its dross, and make use of it without letting ourselves 
degenerate into Western dogmatism. The Chinese people have 
performed a spectacular world-shocking drama on the stage of 
reform, and created a miracle that links socialism with the 
market economy. So long as we base ourselves on China's 
practical conditions, thoroughly study a great deal of difficult 
problems brought up in the practices of reform, and seriously 
sum up the experiences of reform, the Chinese economists will 
surely make their own contributions to mankind.

Breadth and Depth China's Economic Reform and Development in 
1993"] 
  [Text] Sustained Economic Construction, Rapid 
Growth, and Extensive and Profound Changes in Economic Life 
  In October 1993, NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN pointed out in a 
lengthy article: "The Chinese economy is 'expanding' in the 
middle of a world depression. This has not only produced 
crustal changes within China, but is beginning to produce a 
strong impact outside the country." 
  On 17 November, Chancellor Kohl told journalists before 
concluding his visit to China: "It is obviously a country that 
has awakened. Its economy is developing in a spectacular way." 
  In 1993, China's economic development has maintained its 
momentum of rapid growth. Statistics show that the Chinese 
economy has been growing at double-digit rates for 23 months 
running since Comrade Xiaoping made his remarks during his 
inspection tour of South China. The economic growth rate for the 
year 1993 is expected to be around 13.3 percent, and annual GNP 
is expected to exceed 3 trillion yuan. 
  At the end of the year, news from various parts of the 
Chinese countryside is that apart from cotton, major 
agricultural products such as grain and oil-bearing crops have 
all seen good results. 
  In 1993, our country's opening up to the outside world has 
continued to develop in depth, in diverse spheres and in all 
directions, and has exhibited even greater vigor. 
  At present, areas totaling nearly 500,000 square km have 
been 
opened up to the outside world. Some 320 million people live in 
these areas. A Public Security Bureau spokesman announced in 
Beijing on 12 November that the State Council had recently 
approved the opening up of a further 134 cities and counties to 
the outside world. This increases the number of open cities and 
counties to 1,053. Foreigners with valid documents are free to 
travel to these places without having to apply for separate 
travel permits. 
  On 15 November, customs sources said that effective 31 
December, China would reduce tariffs on another batch of 
products (in other words, China voluntarily announced tax cuts 
on imported goods). It is understood that this tariff 
readjustment involves 2,898 items of dutiable goods, including 
some raw materials in short supply in China and machinery and 
equipment that are in great demand. After this 8.8 percent cut, 
the "arithmetic average" of Chinese tariffs will drop to 36.4 
percent. Reportedly the State Council's aim in reducing tariffs 
of its own volition is to "promote the liberalization of world 
trade and promote the merging of the Chinese economy with the 
world economy." 
  On 22 November, the responsible person of the State 
Council's 
Special Economic Zones Office pointed out: The work of 
consolidating development zones has been brought to a temporary 
close. According to consolidated statistics of 26 provinces and 
municipalities, the number of unauthorized development zones 
established by local governments at and below the provincial 
level totaled 2,050. After consolidation, only 470 remain. 
These plus the 100-plus state-sponsored economic and 
technological development zones puts the total number of 
development zones at 600. He expressed this hope: True 
development zones should aim for top- notch world standards and 
truly "prosper." 
  According to the State Science and Technology Commission, 52 
high and new technology development zones have been established 
across the country. Their cumulative income over the past four 
years amounted to 42.9 billion yuan. Total output value was 
33.8 billion yuan, and profits and taxes amounted to 6.2 billion 
yuan. 
  Foreign investment in China has shown signs of rapid growth 
in 1993. Actual import of foreign capital amounted to $9.4 
billion in the first six months, with a further increase of $5.6 
billion in the third quarter. Import of funds for the year is 
estimated to be nearly double the 1992 figure. 
  The development of Shanghai in general and Pudong in 
particular attracted worldwide attention in 1993. It is 
understood that by the end of October 1993, foreign investors 
from 44 countries and regions had established 3,031 
foreign-funded enterprises and shareholding companies in 
Shanghai, with investment totaling $6.124 billion. The 
development of the economic belt along the Chang Jiang Basin 
subsequent to the economic takeoff of Shanghai and Pudong has 
also aroused universal attention. 
  In spring, the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] and 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference met in 
Beijing and the "socialist market economy" affirmed by the 14th 
CPC National Congress was written into the Constitution. This 
provides a fundamental guarantee, in the form of state law, for 
China's economic structural reform. The target of establishing 
a socialist market economy has fueled the enthusiasm of the 
people in town and country, and has become a driving force for 
the development of production this year. 
  This year's economic construction involves two most 
spectacular capital construction projects. First, preparations 
for the Three Gorges Project -- the relocation of residents and 
the construction of preliminary cofferdams -- have been 
unleashed in an all-round way. Sources say that this huge 
project, which involves a static investment of 500 billion yuan, 
17 years of construction and a total installed capacity of 17.68 
million kw, will go full steam ahead next year. 
  Second, railroad construction will continue to be accorded 
top priority by the central authorities. Construction of the 
"Beijing-Kowloon Railway" is in full swing. It is reported that 
more than 120,000 workers from 16 engineering bureaus under the 
Ministry of Railways and from local railroad construction units 
are taking part in the construction of this 2,370-km project. 
By December, 88 km of bridges, 8 km of tunnels, 213 km of 
main-line single tracks and 40 km of side tracks had been 
completed. Construction of the whole project has seen swift and 
satisfactory progress. On the basis of a successful first 
battle, there should not be any problem realizing the goal of 
"completing the track- laying in three years and finishing up 
the project (and opening the railroad to traffic) one year 
afterward." 
  The development of production has brought about an 
improvement in the people's livelihood. Statistics for the 
third quarter show a further increase in the income of urban and 
rural inhabitants. After allowing for price rises, the living 
expenditure income of urban inhabitants was up 12 percent and 
that of rural inhabitants was up about 5 percent. 
  China's urban and rural markets have continued to "bloom" in 
1993. According to statistics, at the end of October, total 
retail sales were 968.7 billion yuan, up 22.4 percent (from the 
same period last year, and the same below), or 9.3 percent after 
allowing for price rises. 
  The living standards of urban inhabitants have seen steady 
improvement. According to the Economic Research Center under 
the State Planning Commission, food consumption by Chinese urban 
inhabitants has reached average international standards. Their 
consumption of clothing, articles of everyday use and durable 
consumer goods has also reached or surpassed the average for 
middle- income countries. The amount of durable consumer goods 
possessed by urban inhabitants has reached the level of Japan in 
the seventies, meaning that China has achieved a modest level of 
prosperity ahead of schedule. In Lhasa alone, 80 percent of 
households have color television sets. This percentage is 
higher than that in France. Total personal consumption of gold 
in China ranks first in the world. 
  Another indicator of the profound changes in economic life 
is 
that the word "market" has become one of the most oft-repeated 
words in China in 1993. The number of topics around the concept 
of "market" that have sprung up in China's economic construction 
and reform that has become a miracle in world economic history. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping told foreign guests back in 1979 that 
socialism can also operate a market economy. In present-day 
China, the scope of the "market" deployment of social resources 
is rapidly expanding, while the scope of "control" of the 
planned distribution of capital goods is steadily shrinking. 
The birth and gradual perfection of the rolled steel market, 
the coal market, the nonferrous metal market, the timber market 
and other markets have put an end to the situation where the 
state has highly centralized and unified control over 
everything. Small commodities markets and farm produce markets 
are developing like a prairie fire. Even the China National 
Nuclear Corporation has followed the footsteps of China's 
aerospace industry and started edging its way into the 
international market. While strictly adhering to international 
standards regarding "the peaceful utilization" of nuclear 
energy, China has begun exporting nuclear power technology to 
Pakistan and Iran, signed cooperation agreements on the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy with 12 countries, and established ties of 
exchange and cooperation with many countries and regions. 
  Reform promotes development, and development is conducive to 
the promotion of reform. Against the background of an ample 
supply of commodities and an increase in people's incomes, price 
reform that has a direct bearing on the public interest has also 
been making big strides forward in a peaceful atmosphere. Some 
economists point out that although the year 1993 has seen the 
expansion of investment and inflation, it has also seen the 
number of commodities controlled by the state slashed to less 
than 30 from 722 in the past. To them, it was "beyond one's 
wildest dreams" that the price reform could have succeeded in 
such a basically smooth manner. 
  According to a survey of 1,539 households in the three 
cities 
of Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai between 15 August and 10 
September by the authorities concerned, 54.5 percent of 
residents have their own consumption plans and panic buying of 
the magnitude seen in 1988 would be unlikely even if prices were 
to go still higher. The reasons given by respondents are as 
follows: 1) Price hikes occur regularly. "Panic-buying works 
for a short time, but you cannot panic-buy all your life." 
Experts say that this is because "the tolerance level of the 
public has been greatly raised." 2) With ample supplies on the 
market, there is no need to panic-buy. 3) Some people say they 
have a small income and do not have the money to panic-buy. 4) 
People believe that the state will take measures to curb soaring 
prices. 5) People have basically purchased all major durable 
consumer goods and there is nothing more to panic-buy. 6) There 
are many other popular avenues of investment, such as shares and 
bonds. 
  The abolition of grain coupons can best illustrate the 
point. For more than 40 years, grain coupons were the most 
important of the various negotiable instruments next to the 
renminbi. However, in the past dozen years or so it seems that 
in an instant grain coupons have changed from certificates with 
no specific price to a "second renminbi" for exchanging for 
eggs, and then ceased being used. Since 1992, some provinces 
have declared grain coupons "invalid." In 1993, the Beijing 
People's Government also announced that grain coupons would no 
longer be used. The invalidation of grain coupons in Chinese 
cities, including Beijing, has not led to social unrest. 
Chinese grain coupons have been withdrawn from circulation into 
the hands of collectors. It is understood that coupons for 
grain, meat, cotton, cloth, eggs, sesame paste and other 
commodities have aroused the keen interest of collectors both at 
home and abroad. A set of seven grain coupons issued in 1982 is 
said to be fetching as much as 100 Hong Kong dollars in the Hong 
Kong negotiable instruments market. 
  There are also problems in the sphere of consumption. In the 
first half of the year, total investment in fixed assets showed 
an increase of 61 percent compared with the same period of last 
year, and of this, 40 percent has already been turned into 
consumption means. However, consumer services for urban 
inhabitants continue to be "lacking" in one way or another, 
primarily in housing, schooling and the installation of 
telephones. Some experts regard the unduly high level of 
spending by urban inhabitants on durable goods and gold 
ornaments as an abnormal phenomenon. 
  Another abnormal phenomenon of social consumption is: While 
education expenses have become an increasingly heavy "burden" on 
most parents, the so-called "elite schools" that charge 
exorbitant fees are flooded with enrollments. While more than 
4.4 million families have housing problems, "garden villas" have 
mushroomed and more than 50 million square meters of commercial 
housing are still waiting for buyers. According to some 
experts, the following description best epitomizes this kind of 
blind consumption: There is a 29-inch colour television in the 
middle of a room 10 square meters in size. "Skin renewal cream" 
costing nearly 100 yuan a bottle is selling like hot cakes, but 
what people get for their money may be a face full of pimples.... 
<H3>  The Positive Results Achieved by the Macrocontrol Measures 
Prove That Macroeconomic Control Is an Integral Part of the 
Market Economy </H3>
  In early 1993, economic "overheating" became a worrying 
phenomenon: The prices of "hot items" such as automobiles, 
rolled steel, aluminum and timber kept "escalating" and there 
was serious hoarding.... This signal reflects that the scales 
of investment and credit have exceeded the tolerance level of 
resources. This, coupled with the increasingly chaotic 
financial and real estate markets and the construction of 
development zones, has seriously threatened the healthy 
development of the Chinese economy. 
  In order to put an end to this abnormal situation, the State 
Council adopted emergency and necessary macrocontrol measures in 
June and appointed Vice Premier Zhu Rongji governor of the 
People's Bank of China. 
  This important personnel arrangement by the State Council 
and 
the "16-point decision" promulgated by the CPC Central Committee 
in June have been regarded at home and abroad as the starting 
point of the drive to consolidate the financial order and 
implement macrocontrol measures. 
  The strengthening and improvement of macroeconomic control 
has formed an important aspect of economic development in China 
in 1993. Facts have proved that the swift and decisive approach 
in consolidating the financial and economic order and the 
implementation of resolute, prudent and effective macrocontrol 
measures are essential in resolving some of the pressing 
problems that have cropped up in economic development. 
  This is best illustrated by the gradual "cooling" of the 
1993 
real estate and development zone craze. After the 1992 "boom," 
real estate and development zones finally entered a stage of 
sober and healthy development in the summer and fall of 1993. 
  We visited the Chang Jiang Delta in January 1993. There are 
so many "development zones" there that it is perhaps not too 
exaggerated to say that they are practically adjoining. The 
inland provinces also refuse to be seen lagging behind, and 
"development zones" have also been set up one next to the other 
in many places. In order to engage in property development and 
the construction of development zones, it is necessary to obtain 
land, build houses and attract investment. With cities and 
counties vying with one another to build houses and "attract 
investment," some local governments are competing to slash their 
land prices. In view of this situation, the State Land 
Administration had to appeal for greater foresight on the 
question of land prices. 
  As property development overheated, real estate agents also 
mushroomed. With the emergence of this "boom," many of the 
malpractices of the old economic structure again revealed 
themselves to the full: Leaders of some units who had nothing 
to do with property development were using public funds to buy 
land and property. 
  Huge amounts of funds rushed from the inland provinces to 
the 
property sector in the coastal areas, and the inflow of funds 
"forced up" land and property prices in these areas. Seeing the 
escalation of land and property prices, more units and people 
pumped money into the property sector. 
  What was particularly worrying was that many financial units 
also became heavily involved. Sources say that some local banks 
"allocated" funds entrusted to their care to their own "three- 
property (san chan 0005 3934)" enterprises, or directly engaged 
in the buying and selling of shares and property. Some engaged 
in inter-bank borrowing in violation of financial discipline.... 
  The "impulsive" development of real estate, development 
zones and capital construction is bound to "push" the prices of 
building materials up. In early 1993, the prices of rolled 
steel, cement and glass went up by 110 percent, 290 percent and 
100 percent respectively compared with early 1992. The sharp 
increase in the prices of building materials touched off a new 
round of hoarding. Since it was difficult to purchase rolled 
steel, cement and glass following the price hikes, inferior 
building materials flooded the market and foreign supplies 
brought in by huge freighters from across the miles were 
"queueing" at Chinese ports waiting to be unloaded. Many key 
state projects could not start work as scheduled because 
building materials were not to be had.... 
  The blind development of infrastructure and processing 
industries made all the more glaring the already irrational 
contradictions in China's existing economic structure; 
transport, energy and power supply were all hard pressed; 
foreign exchange reserves were on the decline; the value of the 
renminbi took a plunge on foreign exchange swap markets.... All 
these inevitably led to another sharp increase in the prices of 
consumer goods. In the first quarter of 1993, the rate of 
inflation was 11.1 percent for the whole nation and 15.7 percent 
in 35 big and medium-sized cities. 
  Because of this, alarms signals were rung in May and June 
1993 on the economic front, particularly the financial front: 
  The lack of cash for the purchase of summer grain meant that 
more "white slips" were likely to be issued; urban and rural 
savings registered a sharp fall; "green slips" involving huge 
amounts were issued in postal remittance; enterprises faced a 
shortage of circulating funds; the ratio of the provisional 
funds of banks (the ratio between surplus reserves and deposits) 
showed an obvious decline; the financial order was chaotic; 
unauthorized financing, inter-borrowing and appropriation of 
funds reached "a stage of insanity," with unauthorized interbank 
borrowing amounting to hundreds of billions of yuan.... 
  It was under such a pressing situation that macrocontrol 
measures were introduced. 
  Jiang Zemin had this to say when he relayed to the 
democratic 
parties the spirit of Document No. 6 of the CPC Central 
Committee on 30 June: The economic situation in the first half 
of this year has been excellent on the whole, but contradictions 
and problems have also emerged, and some of these are quite 
glaring. He emphasized that while the reasons for these 
contradictions and problems were manifold, the fundamental 
reason was that the economic structure had not been properly 
straightened out. 
  Jiang Zemin also pointed out in particular: "The market 
economy not only does not reject macroeconomic control, but must 
have a perfect and effective macrocontrol system." 
  On 1 July, General Secretary Jiang solemnly pointed out in 
his speech marking the founding of the CPC that efforts must be 
made to strengthen party discipline in economic work. "He who 
does not make plans for the whole situation will be unable to 
handle the problems of a single area; and he who does not make 
long-term plans will be unable to solve immediate problems." 
"Those who ignore the interests of the whole ... must be 
subject to strict disciplinary action." 
  The XINHUA NEWS AGENCY carried Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's 
speeches at the National Conference on Financial Work on 5 July 
and 9 July. The gist of his speeches is as follows: We must 
"seize the opportunity to speed up development while ensuring 
stability and avoiding losses, particularly huge losses. We 
must seize the opportunity, treasure the opportunity and make 
good use of the opportunity." "The strengthening of 
macroeconomic control does not mean all-round retrenchment. 
What it means is that we should carry out structural 
readjustment." "The present rapid development is healthy on the 
whole, and problems encountered in the course of advance can be 
resolved through the acceleration and deepening of reform." 
"Tackling the problems of 'bottlenecks' is a pressing task at 
present. The state will make readjustments in the use of funds 
in accordance with its industrial policies." "Finance is the 
economic lifeline of the state. The Central Committee has 
decided to proceed from the consolidation of the financial order 
in resolving the problems encountered in economic development." 
Zhu Rongji urged leaders in the financial sector to strictly 
enforce orders and prohibitions, and emphasized that those who 
failed to do so would be seriously dealt with. He also 
emphasized that this time the Central Committee was applying a 
"partial brake" rather than a "complete brake." 
  In July, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua also discussed, on two 
separate occasions in Beijing, the main problems of the loss of 
macrocontrol in property development. He said: Some localities 
have been overstepping their authority in granting land use 
rights or allowing different departments to grant land use 
rights. The illegal transactions in state-owned land have 
resulted in the abnormal development of real estate. Land has 
been leased out, but its development and use have been severely 
delayed (or, as it is colloquially put, the land which is marked 
out simply lies idle under the sun). The random pricing of land 
on lease has given property speculators opportunities to 
exploit, as a result of which huge proceeds from state-owned 
land have ended up in the hands of "speculators." There are too 
many real estate companies and insufficient means of control 
over them, which has led to loss of control over real estate 
enterprises. The irrational investment structure and the 
construction of excessive numbers of up-market hotels, office 
buildings and resort villas have also seriously affected the 
normal use and working of state funds. 
  The timely introduction of macroeconomic control has hit 
home on many major problems. With the local party committees 
and governments resolutely implementing the decisions of the 
Central Committee, the macrocontrol measures have quickly 
produced initial results. 
  On 30 August, Zhu Rongji announced at the Third Plenary 
Session of the Eighth NPC that initial success had been achieved 
in the consolidation of the financial order in line with the 
correct decision of the party Central Committee and the State 
Council. He also pointed out in particular that in resolving 
the contradictions in economic and financial work, the 
fundamental way out lay in deepening the reform and seizing the 
opportunity to carry out financial reform. 
  In the course of establishing a socialist market economy, 
people have gradually deepened their understanding of how to 
handle the relations between the market mechanism and 
macroeconomic control. 
  On 11 November, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
National Congress opened in Beijing under the watchful eyes of 
people at home and abroad. During the session, General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin further summed up the work of 
macroeconomic control in 1993. 
  He pointed out: "Macroeconomic control by the state and the 
role of the market mechanism are both intrinsic requirements of 
the socialist market economy. The two are unified and 
complementary; they promote each other." "Facts have proved 
that the measures taken by the party Central Committee and the 
State Council to strengthen and improve macroeconomic control 
are entirely necessary and correct." 
  These remarks by General Secretary Jiang at once summed up 
the work of macroeconomic control carried out by the Central 
Committee this year and showed the enhancement of our party's 
understanding of the market economy. Macroeconomic control is 
an integral part of the market economy. 
<H3>  The "50-Point Decision" Adopted by the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee Outlined Socialist Political 
Economy With Chinese Characteristics </H3>
  Like the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, which met from 11 to 14 November, was a "milestone" 
in China's course of reform. The session adopted a 50-point 
decision, fully endorsed the task of establishing the socialist 
market economy proposed by the 14th CPC National Congress, and 
set the basic framework of China's future course of 
market-oriented reform. 
  Under the personal direction of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and 
adhering to the ideological line of seeking truth from facts, 
the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee 
broke through the confines of "taking class struggle as the key 
link" on the basis of the integration of theory and practice for 
the first time, shifted the focus of the work of the whole party 
and the whole nation onto the course of economic construction, 
and ushered in a new period of socialist construction. 
  Under the guidance of Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 14th CPC National 
Congress, on the theoretical plane, for the first time broke 
free of the ideological fetters which had long seen the planned 
economy as an innate characteristic of socialism and put forward 
the great concept of establishing a socialist market economy. 
The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
gave embodiment to the objectives and principles put forward at 
the 14th CPC National Congress, mapped out the overall plan for 
the socialist market economy, and proposed the program for the 
gradual transition from a planned economic structure to a 
socialist market economic structure. 
  In May this year, the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee decided to establish a group for drafting the 
documents of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee. With the Central Financial and Economic Leading 
Group (headed by Jiang Zemin) at the helm, 16 investigation 
groups comprising several hundred people from the Central 
Committee and some of the provinces and cities were dispatched 
to various parts of the country, where they conducted surveys on 
16 topics, such as the transformation of the operational 
mechanism in state-owned enterprises, and wrote investigation 
reports totaling several million characters. The Political 
Bureau also instructed the drafting group that they should take 
as their guidance Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and pay attention to the 
following four principles: While having a fairly comprehensive 
overall plan, it is necessary to tightly grasp the prominent 
contradictions and problems confronting us in our reform and 
development and make breakthroughs in key areas. While 
embodying the general laws of market economy and absorbing and 
assimilating the successful experience of other countries, it is 
also necessary to reflect the essential characteristics of the 
socialist system, sum up our own practical experience and 
proceed from China's own national conditions. While reflecting 
the pressing need to seize the opportunity to speed up the 
establishment of the new system, it is also necessary to take 
into consideration the fact that the establishment and 
perfection of a new structure involves a development process and 
is progressive. While striving for a high ideological and 
theoretical standard, care must be taken to make sure that the 
document is able to guide practical work and is easy to 
implement. 
  The draft went through repeated revisions between May and 
September, and the fifth draft was completed on 28 September. 
This draft was sent to the various provinces, municipalities 
and autonomous regions and various central ministries and 
commissions for comments. Later, the opinions of the various 
democratic parties and the Central Party School were also 
sought. It is understood that more than 270 major changes were 
suggested by comrades. The document was formally submitted to 
the plenary session for deliberation on 11 November. During the 
four-day session, another 30-plus changes were made. 
  The 50-point decision adopted by the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee was born against this general 
background after repeated deliberation and revision. It took us 
only a year between the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee to come up 
with a framework and a specific program for establishing the 
socialist market economy. This was a major breakthrough both in 
theoretical and in practical terms. The decision adopted by 
this plenary session may be considered socialist political 
economy with Chinese characteristics, the continuation and 
development of scientific socialism and Marxist political 
economy, and another great contribution made by the Chinese 
Communists in exploring the socialist road. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin delivered an important speech at this 
plenary session. He pointed out: We can all see that the 
market mechanism is playing an increasingly more important role 
in China's economic life. However, the fact that reform is 
lagging behind in certain spheres is affecting the establishment 
of the new structure and the healthy development of the national 
economy.... We cannot stick to the beaten track of extensive 
operation by blindly going after output value and expanding the 
scale of investment.... It is true that we have many 
difficulties before us, but these have to be resolved through 
the deepening of reform.... 
  Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: "Admittedly the basic 
framework for the socialist market economic structure outlined 
by the decision of this plenary session still needs to be tested 
and continuously perfected in the course of practice. 
Nonetheless, it can still help increase our foresight in 
guiding the work of reform and make reform more effective." 
  The decision of the plenary session has aroused the 
attention 
of the whole world. Some foreign dispatches commented: The 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has 
mapped out a grand blueprint for turning the Chinese economy 
into a socialist market economy before the end of this 
century.... China with its 1.2 billion people has become the 
world's center of growth and is playing the role of locomotive 
in Asia. If all goes well, China may become one of the largest 
economies in the world in the next century. 
<H3>  Combine Package Reform With Breakthroughs in Key Areas, 
Seize the Opportunity To Push the Reform Into the "Stage of 
Final Assault" </H3>
  China achieved tremendous successes in its economic 
restructuring in 1993. The implementation of the macrocontrol 
measures of the Central Committee and, in particular, the 
promulgation of the "50- Point Decision" of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, suggest that reform 
has entered a new stage when package reform will be combined 
with breakthroughs in key areas. 
  The year 1993 has seen a decisive step forward in the price 
reform: Beginning in May, 90 percent of counties (or cities) 
deregulated their selling prices for grain and oils. Also 
liberalized were the ex-factory prices of rolled steel and of 
coal under unified central planning. Partial readjustment was 
also made in the price of crude oil. Direct pricing by the 
state accounted for only 5 percent of total retail sales in 
society, 10 percent of farm produce sold by peasants, and 15 
percent of the sales of capital goods. The weighting of 
products subject to mandatory planning in industrial output 
value dropped to only about 5 percent. 
  China began practicing a new accounting system on 1 July 
this 
year. Foreign dispatches described this as an important 
milestone in China's drive to "close ranks" with the world 
economy. 
  In the reform of the housing system, China has also made a 
quiet but firm step forward in 1993. Although the reform seems 
more sluggish in Beijing (central units in the capital), many 
localities have seen the gradual sale of public housing to 
individuals. Sources said: Since the cost of maintenance, 
management and construction has been going up swiftly, the 
original reform program of "progressive raising of rents by 
small increments" had trouble putting an end to the "dilemma" of 
revenue not being able to cover expenditure. It is understood 
that proceeds from the sale of public housing have been 
reinvested in the construction of new units. In 1993, the sale 
of commercial housing has shown a 55.6 percent growth over 1992. 
However, informed sources also pointed out that in the sale of 
public housing, care must be taken to oppose corruption and 
guard against the emergence of power factors. 
  According to the party Central Committee and the State 
Council, China is now in a position to make breakthroughs in key 
areas while spurring the overall reform. 
  A gratifying situation has emerged in China's reform since 
the Third Plenary Session. At the National Conference on 
Economic Work which met in Beijing in December, Jiang Zemin 
emphasized the need to seize the opportunity to speed up the 
pace of reform, opening up and modernization in order to 
initially establish a socialist market economic structure before 
the end of this century. Centering around this theme, the 
National Work Conference on Economic Restructuring, the National 
Planning Conference, the National Financial Work Conference, the 
National Economic and Trade Work Conference, and the National 
Conference of Heads of Branches of the People's Bank of China 
were subsequently convened in Beijing to discuss reforms of the 
planning, economic, monetary, financial and other systems. The 
year 1994 is expected to be a year of all-round advance in 
China's reform program. 
  In the reform of the economic structure, the reform of 
state- 
owned enterprises is the focus of the focus. 
  The Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 12th CPC 
Central Committee on the Reform of the Economic Structure points 
out that the reform should have as its focus the invigoration of 
enterprises. The invigoration of state-owned enterprises, 
particularly large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, is 
of immense significance. State-owned enterprises occupy a 
dominant position in industrial production in China. They are 
the economic lifeline of our country, and are also a major 
source of revenue. They are also principal employers of 
workers, as well as the foundation of our market economy. Their 
condition naturally has a direct impact on economic development 
and the ultimate establishment of a market economy in our 
country. 
  However, the invigoration of large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises is easier said than done, as enterprise 
reform is a formidable process. From the time decisionmaking 
power was first delegated to the lower levels in the early stage 
of reform to the promulgation of the "Decision on Changing the 
Operating Mechanism of State-Owned Enterprises," the Central 
Committee, the local authorities and the large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises have all done a lot of exploratory work. 
However, these efforts have produced limited results and many 
enterprises have not been "invigorated." 
  The "50-Point Decision" adopted by the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee pushed the reform of 
state-owned enterprises to a new stage. Its major measure, 
namely the "promotion of a modern enterprise system," involves 
the establishment of a modern enterprise system which caters to 
the needs of the market economy, a system based on scientific 
management where property rights, powers and responsibilities 
are clearly defined and where the government does not directly 
interfere with the managerial activities of enterprises. This 
will be the basis for the establishment of the socialist market 
economy. 
  The establishment of a modern enterprise system is a natural 
requirement in the development of socialized mass production and 
a market economy. It is the direction of China's enterprise 
reform, and covers three major aspects: First, the 
establishment of enterprises as legal entities; second, the 
establishment of a system of limited liability; and third, the 
establishment of a scientific enterprise organizational system. 
  This arduous and complicated undertaking requires the 
accumulation of experience and the creation of the necessary 
conditions, and should be conducted step by step. At present, 
it is necessary to continue to implement the Enterprise Law and 
the "Regulations" on changing the management mechanism of 
industrial enterprises owned by the whole people, and to extend 
to enterprises the various rights and responsibilities 
pertaining to their management. 
  For state-owned enterprises, it is useful to experiment with 
the corporate system. However, introduction of the corporate 
system does not simply mean a change of name. The important 
thing is the shifting of mechanism. Enterprises that do not 
have the necessary conditions cannot be arbitrarily turned into 
corporate entities. Only a small number of them can be turned 
into publicly listed limited-liability companies. 
  The specific tentative plan is as follows: The small number 
of large enterprises that are making good profits, are highly 
efficient in management and are in accord with the state's 
industrial policies should be directly reorganized into 
limited-liability shareholding companies with the state holding 
controlling or partial shares. The majority of competitive 
enterprises that are in accord with the state's industrial 
policies should be organized into limited- liability companies 
funded by the state and other legal entities. Companies that 
turn out special-category products should be turned into 
limited-liability companies solely funded by the state. Small 
state-owned enterprises in general may also be reorganized 
through such methods as leasing, contracting, sale, and 
lease-purchase, or turned into shareholding cooperatives. 
State-owned enterprises that have long been performing poorly 
and producing unmarketable goods, have more liabilities than 
assets and cannot be reorganized through other means must be 
declared bankrupt in accordance with law.... These measures 
represent a major breakthrough in both theoretical and practical 
terms. 
  At the end of 1993, the head of the State Economic and Trade 
Commission disclosed at the National Economic and Trade Work 
Conference the following plans for the shifting of mechanism in 
1994: Steps will be taken to implement to the letter the 14 
types of operational autonomy and responsibility in 10,000 large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and to complete the 
work of inventory-taking. "Monitoring committees" will be 
dispatched in groups and stages to 1,000 key enterprises with a 
vital bearing on the national economy and the people's 
livelihood to monitor their state-owned assets. Further, 100 
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises of different 
categories will be selected for the trial implementation of the 
modern enterprise system. 
  At present, apart from planning to systematically reorganize 
the organizational and managerial structures of state-owned 
enterprises in accordance with the "corporate system," the state 
also plans to make a "major move" in the reform of the financial 
and taxation systems. It is understood that this will be "one 
of the tasks in the reform of the state macrocontrol system next 
year." This will include the following three tasks: First, 
replace the existing financial contract system with the 
revenue-sharing system; second, unify the income tax rate for 
all types of enterprises and introduce a system of turnover tax 
with value-added tax as the mainstay; and third, reform the 
taxation system. 
  It is learned that nine localities are currently 
experimenting with the "revenue-sharing system." 
  In the reform of the financial system, the main task is to 
establish as quickly as possible a central banking system which 
will independently implement state monetary policies under the 
leadership of the State Council, and strive to turn specialized 
banks into commercial banks through the organization of 
policy-lending banks, thus separating the policy-related and 
commercial businesses of the banking system. In the reform of 
the investment system, the main task is to define investment 
entities and their scope of responsibility in accordance with 
different spheres of investment, and gradually establish a risk 
responsibility system for corporate investment and bank credits. 
  In addition, the 1994 reform program will also involve the 
further improvement of the market system. The state will 
further push forward the price reform and try to eliminate the 
"dual-track pricing system" for capital goods. In market 
development, the state will put the emphasis on the financial, 
labor, property, technology and information markets. 
  In addition, the State Economic and Trade Commission has, in 
accordance with the Decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, drawn up a "program" for the 
strengthening of economic regulation and control in 1994. 
<H5>  There Are Numerous Difficulties, But the Future Is Bright </H5>
  China has achieved tremendous successes in economic 
restructuring and economic development in 1993, but there are 
still many problems that deserve our attention. 
  According to the State Statistical Bulletin published by the 
XINHUA News Agency, the following are the major problems in our 
economic life: First, investment in fixed assets is growing too 
swiftly. In the first three quarters, investment by state-owned 
units totaled 401.5 billion yuan, up 66.4 percent. Second, 
price levels have been soaring. Average price hikes were 
registered at 12 percent at the end of October, or 18.9 percent 
for 35 large and medium-sized cities. Third, enterprises are 
generally short of production and circulating funds. Some 
less-competitive enterprises have not been doing well in sales. 
These enterprises are confronted by growing inventories and 
mounting debts. Fourth, since little improvement has been made 
in the conditions of agricultural production, and since the 
income gap between urban and rural inhabitants is widening and 
the peasants are not very enthusiastic about farming, the 
problem of rural employment is becoming more and more serious. 
  Unfair distribution and development opportunities have 
worsened. Apart from the fact that the gap between town and 
country and between east and west is widening, the income gaps 
between different ownership systems and different industries 
within the same locality are also widening. This not only 
affects people's choice of jobs, but has also produced a huge 
"flow of personnel" who are solely motivated by prospects of a 
higher income. This has produced drastic changes in the 
original employment "hierarchy" (which is not an entirely bad 
thing). 
  Reform is also faced with some problems that are worthy of 
attention. Some economists pointed out that reform in 1994 
would be "the final assault." In order to avoid detours and 
costly lessons, it is necessary to maintain a good economic 
environment. Experts also pointed out that since some of the 
new reform measures introduced this year or next year were 
directed against administrative organs and key departments, 
whether or not the leading cadres of the organs concerned were 
willing to resolutely bid farewell to old traditions would have 
a vital bearing on the success of the reform. Some experts also 
believed that as China's reform had reached a great depth, even 
reformers themselves had to be highly aware of the need for 
reform. With major reform measures for 1994 about to be 
introduced, it is necessary to guard against conscious or 
unconscious attempts by vested interests to distort the reform. 
  The appeal made by these experts is: China's reform has 
entered the most arduous and challenging as well as the most 
promising stage of final assault. We must do well in this stage. 
  "Reform has its dangers and difficulties, but we can succeed 
if we work hard." 
  With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics providing the guidance, and with 
the people of the whole country unifying their thinking and 
actions, sharing weal and woe and working arduously around the 
party Central Committee headed by Comrade Jiang Zemin, China's 
reform and development will definitely have a bright future. 
  Having already written a brilliant history, we will 
definitely be able to create an even brighter future.

<F P=106> [XINHUA Letterbox: "What Are Property Rights?"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- The property rights 
theory was forwarded in Western economics during the 1930's. 
The discipline of property rights theory and law developed very 
rapidly in 1960's, forming various schools of thought in 
property rights as the Western nations attached great importance 
to it. Currently, although property rights theory has moved 
toward maturity and is widely used, theoretical circles in the 
West have yet to establish a unanimous, complete, and uniform 
standard for an exact concept of property rights. China began 
to practice the property rights concept in 1980's but our 
economic circles were similarly not totally unanimous on the 
concept and its understanding. In particular, the argument that 
property rights amounts to ownership created misunderstanding in 
property rights theory. 
  Although there is not unanimity on the concept of property 
rights currently practiced in enterprise reform, the general 
opinion is that property rights is a concept derived from 
ownership. It is a legal form based on property ownership to 
reflect the rights, interests, and duties of principal investors 
regarding their property. Under normal circumstances, property 
rights are related to operating assets and the amount of capital 
injected by principal investors into enterprises. Once a 
principal investor has injected capital into an enterprise, he 
possesses the corresponding property rights of the enterprise by 
law, and becomes a principal owner of the enterprise's property 
rights. 
  Property rights must consist of two fundamental functions. 
First, they must possess the power and function of profit 
sharing, or the profit function for short, that is, the right to 
share part of the profits realized through the application of 
property in business operations. The economic significance of 
property rights lies in profit-making. Of course, there are 
different ways to represent and realize profits for different 
types of property rights. For example, in property 
organizations under the shareholding system, the profit 
shareholders realize from their property rights is reflected in 
dividends, and the profit of corporations is reflected in the 
right to control the use of undivided profits (generally for 
re-investment) for upgrading corporations' earning capacity, 
thereby raising operating income, workers' wages, and other 
benefits, as well as accelerating corporations' development. 
Second, they must enjoy controlling power, that is, the 
principal to property rights shall not, within legal limits, be 
subjected to any interference in his right to control assets, 
particularly profits. 
  The right to profit and right to control constitute complete 
property rights arising from the production and exchange of 
commodities. A principal is a principal of independent status 
to property rights only when he possesses these two powers 
simultaneously. 
  Property rights and ownership are not one concept. Property 
ownership determines the ultimate ownership of things and shows 
a principal's right to the monopoly of such things. It 
possesses the characteristics of exclusiveness, origin, and 
comprehensiveness. The exclusiveness of ownership indicates 
that, by law, the ownership of things can only belong to one 
principal. Of course, this principal can be a natural or legal 
person. 
  In market economy, major features of property rights are: 
  1. A principal of property rights possesses the 
characteristics of an economic entity, which generally has the 
following three characteristics: First, it must own a definite 
amount of assets for participating in social reproduction. The 
ultimate legal ownership of assets does not necessarily belong 
to the entity. Second, it must directly participate in 
society's reproduction activities. Third, it should possess its 
own independent economic interests, and its main goal of 
participating in society's profit-making economic activities is 
to produce the greatest possible benefit for itself. 
  2. The property rights movement is independent. The 
independence of the property rights movement means that once 
property rights are established, the principal may utilize the 
rights within legal limits to seek the greatest possible 
benefits for itself, and shall not be interfered with by other 
principals at will. A principal may possess many property 
rights, but a specially designated property right can belong to 
only one principal. 
  3. The property rights system is divisible. In a developed 
market economy, due to the development of a credit system, 
property value is separated from the value generated by its 
utilization. Different principals may exercise control over 
different forms of property so as to separate the ownership of 
unitary properties and allow them to be owned by different 
principals.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Personnel Reforms To Put People First"] </F>
  [Text] Economic reform is conducted by people for people. 
And no matter what, all the economic packages will affect 
ordinary folk in the end. 
  China's plan to establish a socialist market economy is no 
exception. 
  This year, the State will speed up its efforts to transform 
its role in economic management. 
  This means China will establish a modern corporate system, a 
nationwide open market, a more reasonable distribution of income 
and a multi-layered social security system. 
  However, these efforts cannot succeed without complementary 
personnel reforms. China is already moving in this direction, 
said Personnel Minister Song Defu recently in Outlook magazine. 
  Administrative organizations under the State Council and 
provincial governments are to develop a civil service this year, 
he said. 
  And the few that don't should be encouraged to pursue open 
and fair competition in personnel management. 
  The enrollment of low-rank civil servants should be done 
through examinations. 
  Song revealed the State is now drafting regulations 
governing 
the exams and the employment and rating of civil servants. 
<H5>  Wage </H5>
  He warned not to confuse government institutions and 
administrations in the civil service as the two will have 
different wage systems. 
  Song said relatively independent institutions should make 
their own decisions on personnel affairs, using various methods 
including public bidding to select their staff. 
  All government institutions should try to support themselves 
and stop receiving State aid, Song said. 
  As for institutions that rely on full State subsidies, such 
as those engaged in basic research and education, a subsidy 
quota should be set regardless of the number of employees. This 
is designed to improve efficiency. 
  Song said managerial and technical personnel should sign 
contracts with enterprises to clarify their rights and 
responsibilities. 
  The salary packages should suit the actual conditions of 
enterprises, institutions and administrative organizations. 
  State enterprises may decide employees' wages for themselves 
according to the supply of labour and demand for jobs, provided 
that the growth rate of their payroll is slower than growth of 
their economic returns. 
<H5>  Social Security </H5>
  He went on to discuss the multilayer social security system 
which he said would cover unemployment benefits and pensions. 
This system should be gradually established, first in 
government departments and institutions. 
  The State, institutions and individuals should all pay for 
the system, instead of the State paying alone. 
  Song said that various types of social security system 
should 
be tested in different regions. 
<H5>  Talent Market </H5>
  On the establishment of a talent market, Song suggested it 
should play a bigger role in the transfer of personnel. 
  But the market must be regulated by laws governing personnel 
flow, Song said. These will be enacted later this year to 
ensure the smooth operation in the market and protect the rights 
of both individuals and enterprises. 
  The State should encourage talented people to work for key 
State projects.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Zhu Jiazhen, vice minister of </F>
labor, from the "Random Talk on the Rural Economy" column by 
staff reporter Liu Xianri (0491 7639 2480); place and date not 
given: "How is Rural Work Force Heading for the Market?--Zhu 
Jiazhen, Vice Minister of Labor, Comments on Building the Rural 
Labor Market"] 
  [Text] The huge transregional movement of rural labor 
force is one of the most magnificent [zhuang guan 1104 6034] 
phenomena arising from reform and opening up in our country. 
  The prosperity along the coast and the development in the 
interior has inevitably been accompanied by massive migration. 
  Even though this type of movement has been relatively well 
organized in some localities, generally speaking, it is still in 
a disorderly state. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee proposed building a labor market. How can we 
help the building of the rural labor market proceed in a healthy 
manner and enable the rural work force to move onto the normal 
and orderly track? I recently interviewed Vice Labor Minister 
Zhu Jiazhen on this issue. 
<H3>  The Job Problem Existing in the Rural Areas is a Necessary 
Element of the Market Economy </H3>
  Zhu Jiazhen thought that our country had already established 
a rudimentary labor market, which is nevertheless still in its 
initial stage of growth. The growth of such a market is not 
proceeding at the same rate in different regions and 
enterprises. Particularly in the vast rural areas, the building 
of labor market has just begun. 
  For more than four decades, the state basically has not 
thought about the problem of jobs for the surplus rural labor 
force. Listing the rural labor force as part of the unified 
resources of the labor force in society when pondering policy 
decisions is a thing which has emerged only in the past few 
years. It is also a requirement for the development of the 
market economy. 
  He said that, in fact, our country's rural labor force 
currently stands at 450 million people, 74 percent of the total 
labor force in society. There are approximately 1.4 billion mu 
of farmland in rural areas throughout the country, as well as 
some reserve land resources. According to a comprehensive 
analysis based on the current level of agricultural productive 
forces in our country, these lands can be operated well by 200 
million laborers at most. In recent years, along with the 
development of secondary and tertiary industries, such as 
township and town enterprises in rural areas, approximately 110 
million rural laborers have been absorbed, but there are still 
100 million surplus laborers who have nothing to do. Most of 
these people live in the major grain- and cotton- producing 
areas and the economically undeveloped areas in central and 
western China. If this surplus labor force is not organized and 
guided to move in a steady and orderly manner, the contradiction 
between many people and little land will intensify, and this 
will seriously hinder the broad masses of peasants from 
improving their living conditions. Inevitably, there will by 
many problems. 
  Our country's task of shifting the rural labor force is 
still 
very difficult, however, and the duty of building a rural labor 
market is even more arduous. Judged from our country's current 
development speed and analyzing according to prevalent 
international practices, the task of reasonably shifting the 
large number of surplus rural labor force cannot be accomplished 
in five or 10 years; it is a huge project which transcends the 
centuries. 
<H3>  Attention Must Be Paid to the Difficulties Caused When Rural 
Laborers Seek Jobs in Other Localities </H3>
  In discussing the difficulties and problems associated with 
building the rural labor market, Vice Minister Zhu Jiazhen 
thought that first, the system of providing employment services 
for the surplus rural labor force must be perfected. For 
various reasons, many laborers are still not included in the 
service network; quick access to information is not available; 
the avenues for providing services cannot meet the demand; some 
localities are still characterized by the tendency of resorting 
to administrative measures; and some localities lack a rational 
structure. Second, there are no venues for training the rural 
labor force, and, even though some localities provide such 
vocational training, they cannot do so on a regular basis, and 
other corresponding service systems fail to catch up. Take the 
problem of insurance in rural areas as an example; some 
insurance systems are based on households and have yet to be 
expanded to include individual laborers. In addition, various 
services, which face the market, lack the necessary funds and 
policy support, to the extent that the service methods of market 
service systems are still in the primitive state of oral 
introduction and that corresponding file management and 
information processing systems have not been established. This 
does not meet the development needs of the labor market. As for 
the means of macro regulation and control, effective ways of 
meeting the needs of the labor market have yet to take shape, 
and macro regulation and control is lagging behind the 
cultivation and development of the labor market. 
  The above-mentioned problems make the outward migration of 
the rural labor force chaotic and disorderly; in particular, 
before and after every spring festival, large "tides of 
laborers" take shape, concentrate, and flow, causing great 
pressure on railways, stations, piers, and other modes of 
transportation, having repercussions on cities and bringing 
about a series of social problems. Individual job seekers also 
suffer serious losses. 
  Zhu Jiazhen thought that the phenomenon of "tides of 
laborers" reflects inadequate job opportunities in the rural 
areas, the inability of the current employment management system 
to cope, and especially the lagging behind of the building of 
the labor market in the rural areas. Trends show that, for a 
certain time to come, transregional rural labor migration will 
expand even further. Therefore, when we uphold the principle of 
developing local economies to enable a large number of laborers 
to change jobs in their own localities, we must earnestly 
improve labor market mechanisms and perfect market regulations, 
order, and corresponding management, service, regulatory, and 
control means, to make the transregional flow of labor force an 
orderly one. This will remove the negative effects of the 
"tides of laborers" and will open up smooth channels for rural 
laborers seeking jobs in other localities. 
<H3>  Establish a New System of Employment and Implement the Plan 
for Coordinating Employment in Urban and Rural Areas </H3>
  In discussing the goal of building the rural labor market, 
Zhu Jiazhen pointed out that the country must form a basic 
system to manage the transregional migration of labor as it 
adapts to the market economy -- as well as a market information 
system and a service network -- to enable the major regions with 
larger scales of inward and outward rural labor flows to achieve 
an orderly migration. The outward flow should be organized, the 
inward flow should be managed, the flow itself should be 
serviced. There should be means of regulation and control, as 
well as diverting measures in case of emergency. 
  In order to improve and perfect the rural labor market, the 
Labor Ministry recently proposed a three-year first-phase "plan 
to coordinate employment in the urban and rural areas." The 
plan will be implemented nationwide, and it targets the major 
areas with inward and outward labor flows, including the 
developed coastal areas such as Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, 
Zhejiang, and Jiangsu and the municipalities of Beijing, 
Tianjin, and Shanghai; it also targets those areas with 
relatively large volumes of outward labor flows, such as 
Sichuan, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Henan, 
Hebei, and Gansu. 
  According to Vice Minister Zhu, in this project, efforts 
will 
first be made to sum up and promote Guangdong Province's 
experience in coordinating with the work force-exporting 
provinces in order to divert the "tides of laborers." Efforts 
will also be made to grasp the work in diverting laborers during 
the spring festival of 1994, and a preliminary set of plans and 
emergency measures will be formulated to divert the "tides of 
laborers." The second step is to establish labor market 
regulations and a system for managing the employment of outside 
laborers in the major work force-importing areas and to 
establish a system registering job seekers who leave the work 
force-exporting areas for other localities. A nationwide 
unified basic system will be established on this base. Third, 
to establish a labor market information exchange center in 
Guangdong, accomplish the building of a labor market information 
exchange center incorporating the three major regions of south, 
east, and north China, and form a system to collect, handle, and 
disseminate labor market information centering on various major 
work force- importing areas. The urban and rural employment 
service agencies in the work force-importing areas should 
thoroughly open up to the rural labor force, and the development 
of urban and rural employment service agencies and various kinds 
of nongovernmental service organizations should be promoted. By 
1996, the key areas should be able to basically ensure orderly 
labor flows. Thereafter, the scope of implementation should 
expand from the key areas to the entire country, so as to 
thoroughly implement the basic transregional labor migration 
system.

<F P=106> [Report: "SHICHANG BAO Carries Article on Ways To Prevent </F>
the Haphazard Rush of Surplus Rural Labor to the Cities"; first 
three paragraphs are RENMIN RIBAO editor's note] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO) -- On 18 December 
last year, this paper carried, across the top of the front page, 
a report on the "program for coordinating employment in urban 
and rural areas" tabled by the Labor Ministry to solve the 
problem of "migrant workers." Today we have reprinted a 
commentary on the problem published by SHICHANG BAO [MARKET 
DAILY] in the hope of calling public attention to the matter. 
  The "rush of peasants job hunters to the cities" stems from 
the imbalance in social economic development and also shows that 
rural labor is moving toward the market. The present problem, 
however, is that the spontaneous rush of surplus rural labor to 
the cities has been very haphazard and has brought great 
pressure to bear upon the departments responsible for 
transportation and urban management, causing much inconvenience 
for those peasants who are going to work in urban areas and 
causing a waste of labor in circulation. The departments 
concerned must do a good job in diverting and protecting the 
rush of surplus rural labor to the cities. 
  The plan for organizing an orderly transregional migration 
of 
rural labor put forward by the Labor Ministry sets the principal 
requirements as follows: "The transfer of labor to other 
regions should be well organized; labor that is transferred from 
other regions should be well managed; labor circulation services 
should be provided; and the circulation of labor should be 
properly regulated and controlled." This plan, which tackles 
the problem head-on, is a positive measure for solving the 
haphazard flow of surplus rural labor. The departments 
concerned should do their utmost to coordinate their efforts and 
make a success of their organizational and propaganda work so as 
to effect an orderly transfer of surplus rural labor. 
  SHICHANG BAO published today carried a reporter's commentary 
entitled "When Will There No Longer Be a Haphazard Flow of 
Surplus Rural Labor?" The commentary analyzed the present state 
of migrant workers and stressed the need to channel the 
increasing "rush of peasant job hunters to the cities" onto a 
normal course -- specifically, to promote and achieve a rational 
and orderly flow of surplus rural labor. 
  According to the commentary, recently a large number of 
peasants have been gathering around Chongwenmen in Beijing every 
day, resulting in the formation of a spontaneous "labor market," 
where employers can choose the laborers they need. Many 
peasants, however, failed to find a job in half a month. A 
survey has shown that migrant workers currently number 20 
million nationwide. They primarily are rushing to the 
economically developed regions, including the Zhujiang Delta, 
the Changjiang Delta, Beijing, and Tianjin from Sichuan, Hunan, 
Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, and other inland provinces. Surplus 
rural labor is currently estimated at 130 million. This reveals 
a serious level of insufficient employment in rural areas. 
Because "many peasants spend three months doing farm work, one 
month celebrating the New Year, and eight months idling about" 
-- which is a saying that truly portrays the plight of many 
peasants -- they are choosing to work in the cities. But some 
peasants fail to get a job because they do not have quick access 
to information or are up against keen competition. Making a 
futile journey and then failing to find a job causes them 
economic losses and mental anguish. In the meantime, the 
practically simultaneous rush of a large number of peasants to a 
few cities puts extremely great pressure on transportation and 
other basic industries, which are already considerably burdened, 
and also makes urban administration and construction more 
difficult. 
  The commentary pointed out: Allowing for the transregional 
flow of the comparatively surplus rural labor is an effective 
way to develop and tap labor resources in rural areas and to 
give jobs to peasants as well as an important method of 
transferring surplus labor. Broadly speaking, this practice is 
in line with the law governing economic development. What 
matters is that the rush of job seekers must be rationally 
guided and controlled so as to promote what is beneficial and 
what is harmful. Some experts predicted that there will be more 
than 10 million migrant workers in the period around the Spring 
Festival, because the underlying factors that have caused the 
rush will still be there. Guangdong has formulated a set of 
effective measures to alleviate the desperate situation. In 
1992, Guangdong established transprovincial (transregional) 
labor coordination relations with nine provinces (autonomous 
regions) including Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangxi to organize 
transprovincial (transregional) labor transfer in an orderly 
way. This has enabled them to gradually effect an orderly 
migration of this huge population. In 1993, the number of new 
migrant workers coming to Guangdong only accounted for 5 percent 
of the total migrant workers in Guangdong and represented a 70 
percent decrease over the 1992 figure. 
  The commentary stressed: To put the increasing "rush of job 
seekers" onto a normal course and to promote a rational and 
orderly flow of surplus rural labor, it is necessary to 
formulate fundamental rules and regulations and to form an 
information system and a service network which are suited to the 
market economy to facilitate transregional labor flows. From a 
long-term point of view, the basic ways to standardize 
transregional labor migration and eliminate the negative effect 
of the rush of peasants seeking jobs, are to promote the 
development of rural labor and create more job positions in 
rural areas by developing the range and quality of agricultural 
production, developing township enterprises, stepping up the 
construction of small towns, and developing tertiary industry in 
townships and towns.

<F P=106> [By Wu Zhe: "Job Hot Line May Be Answer"] </F>
  [Text] Tired of wandering aimlessly and fruitlessly on the 
job market? Just dial 1601155 -- everything is at your 
fingertips. 
  The 160 Wonder Information Centre, an employment hot line, 
has been helping job hunters since last August. 
  As a branch of the Beijing Tonke Information and Technology 
Development Company, it is the first such service in China. 
  "Station 160 is now known as `know-all' in Beijing," said 
Mei 
Nan, an official of Tonke. 
  People who want to find a new job or change professions can 
phone the station, explain their needs to an operator, and get 
the needed information in just a few seconds. 
  An individual's resume and an enterprise's brochure can be 
stored in the station's "Wonder" computer network. Registered 
individuals and companies also can go to the station to search 
for information directly. 
  The computer contains background information on more than 
400 
companies and 6,000 job seekers. 
  The job hot line is a joint venture between the Beijing 
Telecommunications Administration and Wonder Information Centre, 
a private enterprise. 
  The Tonke Company, an arm of the Beijing Telecommunications 
Administration, also manages seven other 160 branch stations 
plus a comprehensive station offering a wider range of services. 
  "Even some big names such as Stone Computer Company and the 
Holiday Inn Lido Hotel are registered here," said Li Guige, 
executive chief of the station. 
  The service operates daily for 14 hours, from 8:30 am to 
10:30 pm, and can handle 500 calls each day. 
  The job-finding information stations and the comprehensive 
station are serving the public well. In Beijing, for example, 
about 34 percent of the people registered have said the hot line 
helped them find a satisfying job. 
  According to the latest statistics, sales promoters are most 
in demand -- more than 50 percent of the registered enterprises 
want to fill such positions. 
  People skilled in computer sciences, secretarial work and 
public relations also are eagerly sought. 
  Of the people registered with the hot line, 28 percent have 
graduated from a university, and 4 percent have double 
bachelor's degrees. 
  "We aim to attract senior managers and scholars to enter our 
network, such as scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
and famous professors at Beijing University," Li said.

  [Text] Guangzhou, January 20 (XINHUA) -- A number of civil 
airports are being built in central and south China with 
locally- raised funds, which will greatly push forward the 
regions' economic development. 
  Some 30 civil airports, which will cost more than 20 billion 
yuan in all, are now either being built, or soon to start 
building, in central China's Henan, Hubei and Hunan provinces 
and south China's Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan. 
  Seven of them will become operational this year or next. 
  Nine other airports have been built in central and south 
China since the country started to carry out the policy of 
opening up and reform in the late 1970s. 
  In addition, military-turned-civil airports were enlarged to 
alleviate the pressure on the Chinese aviation industry. 
  These changes are due to reforms of the investment system 
concerning airport construction. 
  In all the airports, local funds account for the bulk of the 
investment, which used to be entirely provided by the central 
government. Local authorities managed to collect construction 
funds through land leasing, shareholding system, overseas funds 
and international loans. 
  To date, 25 civil airports are operational in central and 
south China, with 137 international and domestic air routes. 
About half of the 24 Chinese cities which have opened air 
routes to Hong Kong are located in the region.

  The four-lane bridge, which will be 12 km long -- 8.5 km 
across open sea -- will connect Nanao County, 160 nautical miles 
from Taiwan, with the continental part of Shantou, one of the 
earliest opened-up areas in China. 
  The bridge is part of the effort of Shantou to catch up with 
the four "little dragons" in Asia -- Taiwan, Hong Kong, 
Singapore and the Republic of Korea -- within 20 years. 
  The bridge and underwater pipes which will carry fresh water 
to the island county will cost 1.2 billion yuan.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "New Laws Essential To Curb Waste in </F>
Mining"] 
  [Text] It is time the central government set up tough 
legislation to protect the nation's mineral resources from 
random exploitation. 
  Minerals are part of the nation's wealth, but China is 
getting inadequate return from mining because of the industry's 
traditional management and benefit distribution system. 
  Under the old system, mining enterprises were deemed to own 
the minerals they dug out. 
  There was no need for them to pay the State anything so they 
were left to enjoy the fruits of any profits they made. 
  Even now, to get easy cash, some enterprises abandon mines 
once they have dug out the most accessible minerals. 
  Meanwhile, others dig where they please leading to a further 
waste of the nation's resources. 
  The old mining system cannot satisfy consumption when the 
national economy is growing fast. 
  And despite China seemingly having abundant mineral 
resources, the amount per head is less than half the average 
world figure. 
  Mining enterprises, instead of relying on government funds, 
should try to fund exploration for new ores themselves. 
<H5>  Licence </H5>
  The problems in the industry are now so grave that a new 
management system and legislation must be drawn up. 
  The new system should make fresh mineral resources the 
property of the State and mining enterprises should apply for 
licenses to the government before digging starts. In addition, 
they should pay the State for the use of mines. 
  It is also essential that mines improve their equipment and 
technology if they are to avoid further wasting mineral 
resources Only a new management and benefit distribution system 
can ease the industry's growth, improve the supply of raw 
materials and so boost manufacturing in the socialist market 
economy.

<F P=106> [By reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Zhao Lianqing </F>
(6392 6647 1987)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- Minister of Agriculture 
Liu Jiang emphasized the necessity to promote rural economic 
development by deepening reforms and adopt reformative measures 
to solve new problems during the course of establishing a 
socialist market economy. 
  Liu Jiang said at a national conference on agricultural work 
here: In order to further deepen rural reform to cultivate 
markets, all localities should seriously explore the following 
this year: 
  -- It is necessary to accelerate the reform of the 
circulation system and the construction of markets for 
agricultural products. Beginning this year, the state will adopt 
a series of policies and measures to promote reform of the 
agricultural product circulation system, with emphasis on reform 
of the grain purchase and marketing system. All localities and 
agricultural departments should step up investigation and study 
and promote the implementation of these policies. The emphasis 
in building markets for farm products should be put on the 
wholesale markets and on making the central wholesale markets, 
regional wholesale markets, and urban and rural farm product 
markets become gradually better coordinated. All localities 
should integrate the implementation of the "shopping basket" 
program with the development of wholesale markets for selected 
farm products in production areas. At the same time, it is also 
necessary to build wholesale markets for agricultural and 
sideline products in marketing areas. In addition, all 
localities should actively explore the cultivation and 
construction of markets for production elements. In particular, 
attention should be paid to building a rural workforce market to 
ensure a rational and orderly workforce flow. 
  -- It is necessary to promote an integrated operation of 
trade, industry and agriculture. The integrated operation of 
trade, industry and agriculture is an inevitable trend of 
agricultural development and rural economic development. When 
an agricultural institution runs an economic entity, it should 
do all it can to become an integrated trade-industry-agriculture 
operation. It should constantly expand its area of service and 
set up various stations and workshops to serve farming 
households. In running village and town enterprises, 
particularly those processing agricultural and sideline 
products, we should develop integrated 
trade-industry-agriculture operations and set up economic 
associations and enterprise groups featuring strong industries, 
famous-brand products, or backbone enterprises. We should 
popularize development by letting market forces guide production 
bases and linking production bases with farming households, and 
we should gradually develop one socialized service for 
regionalized crop cultivation, specialized production, and 
integrated operation. In short, we should develop various forms 
of integrated trade- industry-agriculture organization to link 
the small-scale production of farming households with the big 
markets. 
  -- It is necessary to perfect the basic rural operation 
system. The central authorities have decided to extend current 
agricultural land contracts for 30 more years and permit 
compensated transfer of the right to land use according to law. 
All localities and agricultural departments should provide good 
guidance in this regard. At present, we should pay attention to 
two problems. One is that we must not use any pretext to cancel 
or change the contracts before they expire. The other is that 
we must not arbitrarily increase fees for contractual 
operations, nor increase the peasants' burden in a disguised 
form. We should also promote timely reform of the animal 
husbandry system this year, with the emphasis on implementing 
the compensated grassland contract responsibility system. 
  -- It is necessary to actively develop the rural 
share-holding cooperative system. The share-holding cooperative 
system is a new form of property right created by peasants in 
recent years. We should actively support it, provide correct 
guidance for it, and gradually standardize it. 
  -- It is necessary to promote healthy development of the 
rural cooperative foundations. Agricultural management 
departments at all levels should, as always, guide and support 
the development of rural cooperative foundations. Correct 
guidance should be provided to solve problems accompanying the 
development of some rural cooperative foundations. Existing 
regulations should be applied to govern the development of the 
rural cooperative foundations. 
  -- It is necessary to accelerate the reform of state-owned 
agricultural enterprises. At present, state-owned agricultural 
enterprises generally have problems such as inflexible 
operational mechanisms, weakness in adapting to market demand, 
and low economic efficiency. We should increase the weight of 
reform. All localities should pay more attention to the central 
link -- invigorating operational mechanisms -- and enhance the 
self- development and ability to compete in the market of those 
enterprises. It is necessary to broaden the concept of reform 
in accordance with the requirements of the modern enterprise 
system, and to take greater steps to reform the system of 
property rights. In reform of small enterprises which operate on 
small profits or even losses, we should boldly introduce the 
leasing system, reorganize them into share-holding cooperative 
firms, or sell them through auction. State-owned land 
reclamation enterprises should continue to stabilize and improve 
the agricultural operation system of "small farms within big 
farm." At the same time, they should actively practice the land 
lease system on a trial basis. 
  Liu Jiang also emphasized: To meet the needs of deepened 
rural reform, we should enrich the contents of the experiment on 
rural reform experimental zones, properly readjust their 
geographical distribution, and do an even better job in 
integrating experimental reform with economic development.

<F P=106> [By reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Zhao Lianqing </F>
(6392 6647 1987)] 
  [Text] Beijing, Jan 8 (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a national 
conference on agricultural work, which ended today, State 
Councillor Chen Junsheng stressed: It is critical to 
comprehensively carry out economic structural reform this year. 
The State Council will announce a number of major reform 
measures one after another, which are important steps in 
establishing a socialist market economic structure. To ensure 
their successful implementation, the entire party, from the top 
to the bottom, must make joint efforts, and governments at all 
levels and the vast numbers of cadres and masses in the 
agricultural system should focus closely on this central work of 
the State Council, proceed from its general interests in 
everything they do, and carry out the party's rural policies in 
a down-to-earth manner. They should earnestly improve 
agriculture, carry out rural economic work, and strive to 
accomplish this year's production tasks to create a favorable 
environment for reform. 
  Chen Junsheng pointed out: A prominent problem in our work 
for many years has been that policies are not implemented or are 
distorted in the course of implementation. This is particularly 
true in the case of policies affecting the immediate interests 
of peasants and policies supporting and protecting agricultural 
production. There are both structural causes and causes related 
to awareness and work. Structural causes must be gradually 
resolved through in-depth reform. However, a large amount of 
facts indicates that the problem is largely rooted in awareness 
and work. In many instances, structure cannot be blamed for our 
failure to implement policies. The causes must be found in 
subjective factors, namely, whether party and government leaders 
at various levels truly regard policies as the party's lifeline 
and whether they have firmly established the idea that 
agriculture constitutes the foundation. Without a profound 
understanding of the problems facing rural areas, agriculture, 
and peasants, they will lack initiative and a sense of 
responsibility in policy implementation. Whether or not we can 
successfully implement the party's rural policies is a matter of 
party spirit. All localities and departments must ensure 
successful implementation of central policies without 
obstruction. 
  Chen Junsheng said: Steadily increasing peasants' income and 
the effective supply of agricultural produce is a strategic 
issue affecting the prosperity and development of the national 
economy. To increase peasant incomes more rapidly, we must 
proceed from the overall interest of developing the entire 
economy and earnestly implement the various principles and 
policies adopted by the party and state for the countryside. 
From now on, gradually improving peasants' living standards and 
increasing their income by every possible means will be made an 
important norm in the performance evaluation of cadres at all 
levels. We must judge the work of a locality not only by the 
amount of grain produced but also by the amount of the peasants' 
income increased. 
  Speaking of this year's agricultural and rural work, Chen 
Junsheng asked all localities to carry out the following tasks 
in a down-to-earth manner: 
  1. We must never relax grain and cotton production. We must 
not treat grain production lightly at any time. We are a large 
country where conditions differ from one area to another. If we 
misstep on this issue, no one can help us. Cotton production 
has declined for two years in a row. From now on, we must use 
any and all means to maintain adequate crop acreage and work 
hard to restore our total cotton output to normal levels. 
  2. We must use the market as our guide to vigorously develop 
"three-high" [high technology, high foreign exchange earnings, 
and high efficiency] agriculture. While ensuring a steady 
increase in grain and cotton production, we should let peasants 
freely adjust their agricultural structure and develop 
"three-high" agriculture. To this end we must successfully build 
well the demonstration zones designated by the central 
authorities for developing a type of farming that provides high 
yields of fine quality with maximum efficiency. Provinces could 
also designate a number of provincial- level "three-high" 
agricultural demonstration zones. 
  3. We must continue our efforts to promote the construction 
of vegetable basket projects in various parts of the country. 
Large and medium-sized cities shall maintain a fixed proportion 
of vegetable fields in the suburbs based on the distance to the 
city proper. Vigorous efforts should be made to develop 
vegetable crops, livestock breeding, and fishing. Steps should 
be taken to further enliven circulation and stabilize market 
supply. The State Council will soon hold a vegetable basket 
project conference to focus on resolving problems of vegetable 
supply around the Spring Festival and during next April or May, 
the slack season. 
  4. We must vigorously develop town and township 
enterprises. Whether peasant incomes will increase in a 
sustained way in the next several years still hinges, to a large 
extent, on the rate of growth and efficiency of town and 
township enterprises. These enterprises must stress "internal 
management" and spend more efforts on improving their standards, 
quality, and efficiency. 
  5. We must persistently carry out the work of supervising 
and controlling burdens on the peasants. Central and provincial 
departments concerned must screen, in accordance with the law, 
documents and projects that will affect the peasants' burdens. 
Strict control should be exercised and no projects should be 
undertaken without prior screening and approval to prevent 
eliminated burdens from "bouncing back." At the same time, 
localities should continue to implement the central policies and 
laws and regulations on reducing peasant burdens and should 
remove burdens from peasants accordingly. 
  Chen Junsheng also stressed: Agricultural departments should 
earnestly change their functions and mentality, expand their 
field of work, and strengthen regulation and control. They 
should promote reform and pay attention to policy while taking 
care of production and technology; they should concern 
themselves with the production process and at the same time take 
care of procurement and marketing to link them with production. 
  At the meeting, the Ministry of Agriculture commended 80 
advanced units and 300 advanced workers who made outstanding 
contributions to the control and prevention of bollworms in 1993. 
  Responsible persons from relevant State Council departments 
attended today's meeting.

  [Text] Hefei, January 20 (XINHUA) -- East China's Anhui 
Province has made rapid progress in economic development in the 
past year. 
  According to statistics, the gross domestic product amounted 
to 93 billion yuan-worth last year, an increase of 23 percent 
over the previous year. 
  A provincial official attributed the good result to 
deepening 
the reform of the enterprise mechanism. 
  According to the official, 340 state businesses in the red 
were merged with or sold to more efficient enterprises, or went 
bankrupt last year, and 377 state enterprises tried out the 
share-holding system. 
  Rural industrial enterprises generated output value 
totalling 
110 billion yuan last year, an increase of 92 percent over the 
previous year. 
  Now 30 percent of farmers' income comes from rural 
industries. 
  Thanks to the overall opening policy, Anhui's imports and 
exports went up by 25.7 percent last year over the previous 
year. Exports topped one billion U.S. dollars-worth. 
  Anhui approved the setting up of a record over 1,000 
foreign- 
funded enterprises involving 600 million U.S. dollars of direct 
foreign investment last year. 
  To make full use of its rich natural resources, the 
provincial government has decided to spend 100 billion yuan on 
building nine industrial production centers of steel, coal, 
power, petrochemical, non-ferrous metals and building materials 
in the rest of the 1990s.

  [Text] Hefei, January 20 (XINHUA) -- East China's Anhui 
Province has rearranged its rural economic structure to boost 
high- yielding and high-efficiency agriculture. 
  One of China's major agricultural centers, Anhui reported a 
record output of grain, edible oil, meat, eggs and milk last 
year, and an increase in farmers' incomes. 
  A provincial official in charge of agriculture said farmers 
expanded the acreage under quality rice to 666,700 ha last year, 
up 200,000 ha over the previous year, while introducing improved 
cotton and noted tea varieties. 
  As a result, they turned out five million kg of tea last 
year, worth 130 million yuan. 
  Last year also saw Anhui produce 260 million kg of cotton, 
15.66 million kg of oil-bearing seeds (up 12 percent over the 
previous year) and 1.61 million kg of silkworm cocoons (up 13.3 
percent). 
  Now urban residents have more choices of vegetables grown 
and 
sold by local farmers who pay close attention to the market 
needs. 
  Anhui produced 1.37 million tons of meat last year, an 
increase of 6.4 percent over the previous year, 370,000 tons of 
eggs, up 2.2 percent, and 340,000 tons of aquatic products, up 
11.86 percent. 
  Following the development of rural industries over the past 
two years, farmers' incomes last year reached 670 yuan per 
capita, up 100 yuan over 1992.

  [Text] Hefei, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in east 
China's Anhui Province are not only becoming increasingly 
market-oriented but internationally conscious as well. 
  The Dabie Mountain area in northern Anhui is rich in natural 
resources. But for a long time the local economy remained 
underdeveloped due to its inaccessibility. Now the country's 
opening up has broadened farmer's minds. 
  After learning that wild vegetables locally available are 
popular in Japan, farmers in Huoshan in this mountainous region 
immediately set up a factory to process them for export, 
bringing in three million U.S. dollars a year. 
  They found out that nothing succeeds like success. By 1993 
the inland province was home to more than 500 overseas-oriented 
operations run by farmers. The goods exported were valued at 
close to 1.5 billion yuan last year. 
  In China, some rural enterprises have been built into 
large-scale production bases and can rival foreign competitors. 
Their products range from car jacks to sweaters for the 
American basketball team "The Chicago Bulls". 
  Nationwide, farmer-run enterprises exported commodities 
worth 
190 billion yuan in 1993, up 60 percent over the previous year.

  [Text] Fuzhou, January 20 (XINHUA) -- East China's Fujian 
Province set a record in tax revenues last year, with a sturdy 
51.1 percent rise over the previous year. 
  To achieve better tax receipts, the province took forceful 
measures to curb tax losses by keeping levies and management 
under strict control. 
  The province's industrial output value last year hit more 
than 85.4 billion yuan, a 33.5 percent increase over the year 
before. 
  The total annual output value in 1993 was 13.5 billion yuan, 
about 3.5 times the amount in 1980. 
  Its economic returns also picked up last year, with an 
annual 
sales rate of 96.6 percent and an economic gain index of 106 
percent. 
  In addition, it set up 4,695 foreign-funded enterprises, and 
signed contracts with overseas businesses worth over 11.3 
billion U.S. dollars, including 2.8 billion actually used. 
  Most of its 5,753 joint ventures are now making profits, 
becoming major tax sources. 
  The taxation departments kept a close watch on the 
management 
of tax exemption, removing or revising 140 stipulations 
concerning exemption. 
  This made the provincial tax revenue rise about 1.62 
percentage points in the first half of 1993. 
  The government also raised the tax quota for the private 
sector by an average 34.5 percent, and the tax receipts 
increased by a total of 8.25 million yuan monthly.

  [Text] Fuzhou, January 22 (XINHUA) -- East China's Fujian 
Province will accelerate the pace of converting state owned 
enterprises into limited liability companies or joint stock 
companies with limited liability, according to an official with 
the provincial commission for restructuring the economy. 
  The official said quite a number of medium-sized and large 
state- run enterprises have acquired the necessary conditions as 
provided by the new corporation law of the country. 
  Stress will be put on floating B stock on overseas bourses 
and preparations to issue H stock on the Hong Kong stock market, 
as the province's geographical location makes its 
internationalization possible. 
  In 1994, seven companies are expected to be listed and they 
will issue 301 million yuan worth of A shares and 160 million 
yuan worth of B shares. 
  These companies, all in the fields of energy, transport and 
raw materials, are well-run and export-oriented. They will use 
the share capital raised for infrastructure or hi-tech projects. 
  Meanwhile, the province is to promote the buying and selling 
of treasury bonds it will also pick up some corporate shares, 
which are expected to bring in good returns, for trading through 
special systems. 
  According to its plan, the province will try to convert some 
poorly-run big enterprises into holding or solely state owned 
companies. 
  After ten years of effort, the province boasts 343 joint 
stock companies, with 123 million yuan in stock capital. And 
ten companies have been listed on the stock exchanges.

  [Text] Fuzhou, 12 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The Fujian 
Armed Police Headquarters is carrying out activities to crack 
down on "bogus armed policemen" across Fujian Province and has 
found over 20 "bogus armed policemen" and four bogus armed 
police driving licenses. 
  Since last year, some lawbreakers in Fujian society have 
disguised themselves as armed police officers and policemen and, 
under the pretense of performing official duties, have 
blackmailed restaurants and dance halls to extort money from 
them, detained people under the pretense of checking identity 
cards, or have manufactured fake armed police driving licenses 
to carry out criminal activities, thus damaging the image of the 
armed police among the people. 
  According to reports, the Fujian Provincial Armed Police 
Headquarters has set up special organs to crack down on bogus 
armed policemen. It has also sent armed police inspector teams 
to the streets to arrest people who wear armed police uniforms 
without collar insignias, confiscate their uniforms, and 
severely punish those who carry out illegal activities under the 
disguise of policemen. In September last year, as two young men 
in armed policemen's uniforms wearing caps with a large peak, 
but without police insignia, were buying fruit at a stall in 
front of Fuzhou Railway Station, they accused the owner of the 
stall of blocking the way and demanded fines. Three armed 
policemen on patrol approached, exposed the fraud on the spot, 
arrested the two young men, and took them to the police station. 
  Hong Shaohu, head of the Fujian Armed Police Headquarters, 
said that work to crack down on bogus armed policemen would 
continue for a long time to come.

  [Text] Fuzhou, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Fujian Province in 
east China has joined China's top ten regions in terms of its 
rural industry, with a turnover of 191.3 billion yuan from its 
rural enterprises in 1993, provincial officials said here today. 
  The officials said this figure is 85 percent up from 1992, 
and represents 60 percent of the province's agricultural and 
industrial output value in that year. 
  In 1993 the province's village and township industrial 
enterprises produced an industrial value of 68.7 billion yuan, 
exported 17 billion yuan-worth of goods and contributed a total 
of eight billion yuan to the state coffers in taxes, the 
officials noted. 
  According to the officials, the shareholding system has 
proved to be especially suitable for rural enterprises. 
  In 1993 the province registered 19,000 rural joint stock 
companies with a total capital of more than 10 billion yuan. 
  In Zhangzhou city alone over 4,000 stock companies were 
launched in 1993, representing 80 percent of the newly-formed 
rural enterprises. They boast a total registered capital of 800 
million yuan. 
  Over the past year, while launching 1,800 joint ventures 
with 
overseas businesses, rural enterprises in the province also 
started 31 ventures abroad, the officials said. 
  In 1993 rural enterprises received 800 million U.S. dollars 
of overseas investment, which accounted for 40 percent of their 
total capital input in the year. They also gained 3.9 billion 
yuan in investment from other Chinese regions. 
  In the same period rural enterprises formed 94 group 
companies and launched 700 industrial development areas. One of 
them, the Fuxing Development Area on the outskirts of this 
provincial capital, has 132 projects in operation or under 
construction. Supported by 300 million U.S. dollars in 
contracted overseas investment, its production value is expected 
to reach one billion yuan a year. 
  The officials said rural enterprises have greatly boosted 
the 
economies of the rural areas and increased the incomes of 
farmers. The province now has 69 villages each with an annual 
production value of 100 million yuan.

  [Text] Fuzhou, January 20 (XINHUA) -- East China's Fujian 
Province has worked out a new way to help poor areas become 
prosperous by setting up cooperation ties between the rich and 
the poor. 
  Such cooperation ties have been established between nine 
counties and cities, each with annual revenue of over 100 
million yuan, and their counterparts with annual revenues below 
20 million yuan. 
  With the progress in the reform and economy, this coastal 
province has become one of the most developed areas in China. 
But the gap between its coastal and inland areas has enlarged 
because of historical and natural reasons. 
  The provincial government decided to forge cooperation 
between the above mentioned nine counties and cities and nine 
poor counties in the fields of the development of natural 
resources, and exchange of technologies, cadres, technicians, 
laborers and information. 
  The main methods include the rich counties providing funds 
for the poor based on a share-holding system. 
  The funds have been mainly used in service sector such as 
real estate, commerce and tourism. 
  Some joint-venture factories have been founded to exploit 
local natural resources. 
  Meanwhile, the provincial government has formulated 
preferential policies to help the development of such 
cooperation. 
  For example, Fuzhou, capital of the province, has helped 
shouning county to sell and export tea, stone slabs, and stone 
and wood carvings. And Shishi City has agreed to find work for 
5,000 laborers from the poor county of Zhenghe.

"Seventh (Enlarged) Plenum of the Eighth Provincial CPC 
Committee Closed; Plenum of Provincial CPC Committee Adopted 
`Resolution on Implementing "Decision" of the Third Plenum of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee' and `Resolution on Convening of 
the Ninth Provincial Party Congress'; Chen Huanyou Summed Up 
Meeting, Putting Forward Demands on Relaying, Implementing 
Guidelines of the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
and Current Work"] 
  [Text] The Seventh (Enlarged) Plenum of the Eighth 
Provincial CPC Committee ended in Nanjing yesterday afternoon 
after successfully accomplishing all its missions. In a plenary 
session held before the end of the meeting, the provincial party 
committee adopted two resolutions, namely "Resolutions on 
Implementing the `Decision' of the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee" and "Resolution on Convening of the Ninth 
Provincial Party Congress." A member of the Standing Committee 
of the provincial party committee presided over the plenum of 
the provincial party committee yesterday. Addressing the closing 
session, Provincial Party Committee Secretary Chen Huanyou put 
forward demands on relaying, implementing guidelines of the 
Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and current work. 
  Chen Huanyou said: For the past four days, attending 
delegates have been conscientiously studying guidelines of both 
the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
National Economic Work Conference; hearing reports from the 
provincial party committee; and enthusiastically taking part in 
discussions after taking realities into consideration and 
sharpening minds. With further unification of understanding, 
better understanding of the guiding thoughts for work to be 
carried out next year and various work and missions, and a 
clearer way of thinking in respect to reform and opening up, a 
good foundation has been laid for the successful implementation 
of next year's programs. 
  Chen Huanyou emphasized: Various localities and departments 
should conscientiously implement guidelines of the Third Plenum 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee and have their current jobs 
well done. Although leaders may spend more energy in carrying 
out extra activities during New Year's Day and the Spring 
Festival, we should not loosen our economic work even under 
these circumstances. We should make use of the favorable, brisk 
business conditions prevailing in the festive seasons to promote 
operational and sales activities in the markets. We should 
appropriately handle the circulation of funds for energy, 
transportation and major enterprises and make early arrangements 
to facilitate the transportation of passengers during the Spring 
Festival. We should attach greater importance to safe 
production by strengthening fire prevention, in particular, and 
eliminating hidden dangers to avoid major accidents; vigorously 
embark on winter irrigation construction; truly do a good job in 
work relating to year-end distribution and cash payments; and 
speed up preparations for next year's spring farming and 
production. In improving price management and market supply, 
various localities should closely watch the price movements in 
the markets and conduct timely studies before formulating 
measures and plans for containing commodity prices. It is 
necessary to strengthen guidance and coordination over prices of 
the daily necessities of the people, including grains, oils, 
porks, fowl eggs, and vegetables to prevent the people's costs 
of living from rising. Various localities should make greater 
efforts to ensure adequate supply of festive goods in the 
markets and show concern over the livelihood of the masses, 
especially that of exceptionally poor families. We should 
attach greater importance to the question of social order and 
continue to take stern actions to prevent the crime rates from 
going up. For public places having complicated problems of 
social order, a concerted, special crime- screening exercise 
should be conducted to wipe out all sorts of ugly social 
phenomena. We should continue our efforts to severely crack 
down on highway bandits, railway robbers, and local evil forces. 
Deadlines should be set for solving problems in certain 
stretches of roads and localities to help create a better social 
environment for economic development and people's livelihood. 
Chen Huanyou pointed out: It is necessary to firmly and 
effectively carry on the anti- corruption struggle, making sure 
that undesirable practices will not make a comeback during the 
festive seasons. Currently, special efforts should be made to 
simply various meetings, celebrations, and commendation 
activities and vigorously promote civilized and thrifty habits. 
We should strictly implement the guidelines set by the circular 
issued by the General Offices of the party's Central Committee 
and the State Council "On Strict Banning of Offering Foods, 
Drinks, and Gifts With Public Funds and Extravagance and Waste 
During 1994 New Year's Day and the Spring Festival." Leading 
cadres at various levels should take the lead in practicing 
honesty and self-discipline and continue to do well in 
anti-corruption struggle and building party style and clean 
government, making sure that New Year's Day and the Spring 
Festival will be celebrated in a clean and honest way amid 
festive joys. We should draw up plans to help the troops and 
family members of the armymen solve practical problems and 
further promote army-people joint effort in building material 
and spiritual civilizations and "double support" activities. 
  Chen Huanyou urged various localities and departments to 
appropriately relay and implement guidelines of this meeting and 
make concrete arrangements for work to be carried out in 1994, 
after taking into consideration realities of their own 
localities and departments and clearly identifying their 
objectives and ways of thinking.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai registered 
58,000 new domestic-funded enterprises last year, bringing the 
total number of such establishments to 230,000, according to a 
local official. 
  Over 40 percent, or about 50,000, of the new firms were in 
the service sector, said Cui Shanjiang, director of the Shanghai 
Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC). 
  To facilitate enterprise development, SAIC simplified 
registration procedures and granted a broader business scope for 
new enterprises. 
  Overseas-funded enterprises also increased by 185 percent, 
or 
4,448, last year, with a total investment of 16.1 billion U.S. 
dollars and registered capital of 8.36 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Most noticeable was the growth of private enterprises, which 
reached 8,247 in 1993, up 95 percent over the year before. 
  Private enterprises are also branching out from processing, 
commerce and restaurants to high-tech industries. Average 
capital also jumped from about 70,000 yuan per business in the 
past to 210,000 yuan now. 
  To date, 129,000 private establishments in industry and 
commerce have been registered in Shanghai. Last year they 
generated 1.115 billion yuan in gross output.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 20 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is 
expected to be built into China's largest state bonds market 
this year, according to Wei Wenyuan, general manager of the 
Shanghai Stock Exchange. 
  He said the stock exchange has been authorized by relevant 
departments to implement this year's issue of state bonds 
through a trading and clearing center. 
  He also disclosed that a plan for an open bonds market to 
overseas investors has been brewing, with its aim to introduce 
more foreign funds. 
  Before 1992, the bonds trading volume in Shanghai accounted 
for 30 percent of the country's total. 
  After a year's slowdown, the city decided to recover the 
market in 1993, as a step to restoring its status as a financial 
center for the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Wei said the Shanghai Stock Exchange will open further in 
the 
field, after its successful experiment in state bonds settlement 
last year. 
  He was confident about the prospect of the market, because 
it 
is important for the country in fund collecting and in 
macro-control of banking savings, currency supply and resources 
allocation.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Many 
administrative units are vacating their buildings in Waitan (the 
Bund along the Huangpu River) in Shanghai, to give way to 
domestic and foreign banking institutions. 
  The move, estimated to bring in hundreds of millions of 
yuan, 
is an important step for Shanghai's comeback as a financial 
center for the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Already a few banking giants, such as J.P. Morgan and 
Citibank from the United States, and Credit Lyonnais and Banque 
Indosuez from France, have shown intentions to set up branches 
or representative offices here. 
  According to Shanghai's blueprint, Waitan, which claimed 113 
bank buildings before 1949 and was transformed into the city's 
administrative center afterwards, will be built into China's 
"Wall Street". 
  A special institute has been established by housing 
management units, to help relocate the departments in these 
former financial buildings mainly along the East Zhongshan Road. 
  Since last year, quite a few buildings have changed 
ownership. For example, China foreign exchange center has used a 
building which previously belonged to the aerospace industry 
administration. 
  Now, many units, such as the municipal trade unions, textile 
bureau and foreign trade administration, are preparing to 
withdraw from Waitan.

  [Text] Shanghai, January 20 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai 
Municipal Government has decided to strictly restrict land 
developers' occupation of vegetable plots in the suburbs of 
Shanghai. 
  The measure is aimed at bringing the soaring prices of 
vegetables under control and guarantee vegetable supplies for 
Shanghai residents. 
  According to a circular dispatched by the General Office of 
the Shanghai Municipality, only major construction projects and 
development zones planned by the municipal government are 
eligible to occupy a part of traditional vegetable-growing 
lands, with approval of the municipal vegetable leading group as 
a prerequisite. 
  Also stipulated is that after being granted the right, land- 
occupants must pay occupation fees ranging from 450,000 to 
900,000 yuan per ha. [hectare] in accordance with the varied 
grades of plots. The fees will be used for development of new 
vegetable- growing lands. 
  In recent years, rapid urban construction and the economic 
boom in Shanghai have cast a shadow over the "vegetable basket" 
project suggested by local government aiming to supply residents 
with plenty of fresh vegetables and diary products. 
  The past two years have seen more than 2,666 ha. of 
vegetable 
plots in the nearer suburbs of the city, which were important 
vegetable bases in the past, occupied by major construction 
projects and burgeoning township enterprises. 
  The shrinkage of vegetable growing areas, coupled with the 
destruction of irrigation systems in existing vegetable plots, 
has affected the normal supply of vegetables to the city and 
caused a continuous price hike.

  [Text] Hangzhou, January 20 (XINHUA) -- East China's 
Zhejiang Province has stressed service trades in a bid to 
develop its market economy. 
  According to statistics, the provincial service trade sector 
has expanded at an annual speed of 13 percent over the past 
decade. It now has employs about five million people, or one 
for every five employees in the province. [sentence as received] 
  In addition, there are more than 4,000 markets forming a 
network with large wholesale markets as the leading factor, 
professional markets as the mainstay and rural fairs as the 
basic units. 
  In Yiwu city, known as the country's largest producer of 
small commodities, more than one third of the labor force is 
engaged in service trades, accounting for more than one half of 
the city's economy. 
  At present, Zhejiang has about 200 market towns, and they 
are 
developing into new political, economic and cultural centers. 
  Since 1989 the province has invested more than 10 billion 
yuan in building roads, bridges and telecommunications 
facilities while transforming airports and ports to meet the 
needs of its rapid economic development. 
  The improved investment conditions have attracted streams of 
tourists and business people from overseas. 
  Last year saw the province receive 700,000 visitors from 
overseas and obtain over 100 million U.S. dollars from tourism. 
  In addition, the province absorbed one billion U.S. dollars 
in foreign investment and exported 4.4 billion U.S. 
dollars-worth of goods last year.

  [Text] Beijing, January 20 (XINHUA) -- China is to develop 
Daxie Island into a first-class international port and an 
export- oriented development zone within 15 years, a plan which 
has attracted attention both at home and abroad. 
  Daxie Island is located in the northeastern part of Beilun 
District, Ningbo city, east China's Zhejiang Province. Around 
40 kilometers from downtown Ningbo, it occupies an area of 30.89 
square kilometers. The Chinese State Council last March granted 
approval to the China International Trust and Investment 
Corporation (CITIC) to develop land on Daxie Island and to apply 
policies covering economic and technological development zones. 
  CITIC hosted a briefing on the development of the island 
here 
this morning with some 60 participants from various foreign 
firms and companies in Beijing attending. 
  Speaking at the briefing, a CITIC official in charge of the 
program said that in the first three years between 1994 to 1996, 
the island development will be focused on infrastructure 
facilities, such as construction of water and electric power 
facilities, telecommunications, highways and bridges, so as to 
form a better investment environment for future prospects. 
  According to the official, the development of the island has 
become a "melting pot" of various companies in the world. So 
far, companies from the United States, Britain, Japan, Italy, 
Germany and the Netherlands as well as from Hong Kong, Macao and 
Taiwan have been to the island where they discussed possible 
cooperation projects with the Chinese side. Some have signed 
cooperative contracts and memorandums of understanding with 
CITIC. 
  Wei Fuhai, chairman of the board of CITIC Daxie Company, 
said 
that the island enjoys geographical advantages, favorable 
natural conditions and good surroundings, and its exploitation 
is significant to the development of the Shanghai Pudong 
Development Zone, the Chang Jiang river delta and the regions 
along the river.

  Regional party Secretary Zhao Fulin spoke on the importance 
of Guangxi's united front work and on strengthening party 
leadership over united front work. 
  He pointed out: The united front has always been an 
important component of the party's general line and general 
policy. It plays a unique and superior role in promoting all 
aspects of work. He requested all levels of party committees to 
strengthen their leadership of united front work, to list this 
work on their agenda, to seriously put it into effect, to 
coordinate work of relevant departments, to determine 
organizational forms and work methods for coordination, and to 
blaze a new trail in Guangxi's united front work. 
  At the meeting, regional party Deputy Secretary Liu Mingzu 
analyzed the current situation and characteristics of Guangxi's 
united front work. 
  He pointed out: In this new situation, Guangxi's main tasks 
in united front work are to study and implement the spirit of 
the national united front work meeting; to further improve the 
CPC-led multiparty cooperation and political consultative 
system, to cultivate, select, arrange, and employ nonparty 
people; to support democratic parties in strengthening their 
self-improvement; to do a better job in the work concerning 
minority nationalities; to strengthen management over religious 
affairs according to law; to guide religion in complying with 
socialist society, to gradually improve the operational 
mechanism for nonparty intellectuals; to actively conduct the 
work concerning nonparty intellectuals who have influence and 
representation; and to carry out overseas united front work 
through various channels in a planned way. 
  Huang Yuyang, vice chairman of the regional committee of the

  [Text] Haikou, January 18 (XINHUA) -- Hainan Province in 
South China will complete the draft of 35 sets of economic rules 
and regulations this year, said a government official. 
  This province, which enjoys special legislative power as the 
largest special economic zone in the country, claims to lead the 
way in economic reform legislation. 
  From 1988, when the province was established, to the end of 
1992, Hainan promulgated over 24 sets of regulations to ensure 
the smooth and healthy development of a market economy. In 1993 
the province's legislative work speeded up, with 18 sets of new 
legislation put into effect. 
  The regulations provide simplified procedures for the 
application and registration of enterprises, and so far over 
19,000 enterprises have been registered, among which 3,889 are 
foreign funded. 
  The provincial people's congress recently passed three 
regulations on insurance to get everyone, employed or 
self-employed, covered by social insurance.

  [Excerpts] Provincial party Secretary Guan Guangfu spoke 
at a provincial economic work meeting which opened on 13 January. 
  He said: [passage omitted] There is a need to: Strengthen 
the position of agriculture as the foundation; bring into full 
play the role of large and medium enterprises; pay attention to 
the main points of economic growth; strengthen the construction 
of basic facilities and basic industries; alleviate bottleneck 
restrictions; expedite scientific and technological progress; 
strengthen the weak links in textile and other light industries; 
improve economic results and quality; and to promote the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy. In terms of work methods, we must increase the 
momentum in four aspects, namely, we must continue to increase 
the momentum: Of reform, to ensure the implementation of the 
party central committee and the State Council's reform measures 
in Hubei; of opening up to the world, particularly to Hong Kong, 
Macao, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States; of 
development and promoting the good trend of Hubei's overall and 
speedy economic development since Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
southern tour talks; and we must continue to increase the 
momentum of implementing policies. The general target of 
endeavor for this year is to catch up with the rest of the 
country by focusing on economic construction so that 
breakthroughs are made in all trades and undertakings. 
  To ensure the fulfillment of this year's tasks and 
objectives, he stressed: 
  1. We must put agriculture in the first place of economic 
work, optimize the rural economic structure, invigorate rural 
markets, explore employment avenues, and invigorate the rural 
economy. 
  2. We must improve large and medium state enterprises by 
means of reform and opening up. This is the central issue in 
this year's economic work. It is necessary to continue to 
implement "Enterprise Law" and the relevant regulations, to put 
into effect all decisionmaking rights of enterprises, to orient 
enterprises toward markets, to reduce enterprises' burdens, to 
create a relaxed external environment for enterprises, and to 
make a breakthrough in establishing a new enterprise system. 
  3. We must strengthen the construction and technical 
transformation of key industries and key enterprises so that 
they are updated. In particular, we must pay attention to the 
construction of the Three Gorges project and provide good 
services for its construction and Hubei's development. 
  4. We must continue to widen the scope of opening up and 
raise the proportion of the export-oriented economy; foreign 
economic relations and foreign trade are aimed not only at 
increasing foreign exchange earnings but also at providing 
international market information for Hubei's economic 
development and providing services for the improvement of its 
economic quality and modernization. 
  5. We must strengthen the construction of transportation, 
energy, telecommunications, and other basic facilities to create 
good conditions for reform, opening up, and economic development. 
  He said: This is the third year of sustained economic 
development since the province entered a fast development track 
in 1992. The basic figures we have set are high and nor is the 
development rate slow. However, facing sharp market 
competition, we must understand that our fraternal provinces and 
cities are also working with enterprising spirit. If we make 
slow progress, we will fall behind. We must stand on the 
heights of the era and strengthen our sense of urgency, our 
sense of responsibility, and our sense of historical mission. 
  Guan Guangfu pointed out: We must pay full attention to the 
main subject of reform and development and correctly handle the 
relations between reform, development, and stability. Reform 
can help emancipate the productive forces. Without reform, 
there can be no major development, nor will there be prolonged 
social stability. This will be a year in which the most reform 
measures will be introduced. The current reform has an 
important bearing on the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure. We must work in a down-to-earth manner with 
full political enthusiasm and a clear-cut attitude to score a 
complete victory in reform. To carry out this reform, we must 
bring about upsurges in study. First, we must study Volume 3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and his new 
concept, knowledge, and methods about the socialist market 
economy. Second, we must further emancipate the mind and seek 
truth from facts. Third, we must correctly handle the relations 
between local and overall interests. [passage omitted] Fourth, 
we must be good at proceeding from our actual conditions and 
carrying out our work creatively. Fifth, we must persist in 
dialectical materialism to reduce the faults in our work to a 
minimum. 
  Guan Guangfu pointed out: This year, in the course of 
deepening reform, we must continue to preserve the good trend of 
speedy economic development, uphold the fact that development is 
a fixed principle, persist in the principle of three 
favorable's, maintain a firm grip on development, and regard 
development as the central issue in handling the relations 
between reform, development, and stability. Speeding up 
development is needed in developing the economy, ensuring 
supply, and in maintaining social stability. [passage omitted] 
  Guan Guangfu stressed: First, we must make a breakthrough 
in the structural adjustment; second, we must develop our 
economy to a certain scale; third, we must seek new 
opportunities for more key projects; fourth, we must pay 
attention to the method of using talented people to build Hubei 
into a capital pool; fifth, we must further widen the scope of 
opening up; sixth, we must expedite economic development along 
the Chang Jiang and bring Wuhan City's leading role into play. 
  Guan Guangfu pointed out: Maintaining stable economic order, 
as well as social and political stability, is a prominent issue 
which should be given full attention this year. Stability is 
the basic condition for smoothly carrying out reform, opening 
up, and modernization. All localities should strengthen the 
comprehensive management of social order, strengthen their clean 
administration, and further improve the relations between the 
party and the masses and between cadres and the masses. They 
should properly resolve the arrears of wages for government 
cadres before 1 February. 
  Guan Guangfu stressed: Strengthening leadership and ensuring 
the implementation of policies are the crux of deepening reform 
and expediting development this year. First, the implementation 
of the party's basic line and major policies should be ensured; 
second, leading groups at all levels should be further improved 
because this is the organizational guarantee for implementing 
policies; third, early preparations should be made for all 
tasks; fourth, leaders and departments at all levels should form 
a responsibility system for the fulfillment of targets during 
their terms of office; fifth, leading cadres in all departments 
should do actual work and tell the truth; sixth, collective 
leadership should be combined with work distribution and 
assuming responsibility for individual work; seventh, general 
calls should be integrated with specific guidance. 
Departmentalism is not allowed, nor is anyone permitted to keep 
the advantages for himself and leave the difficulties for 
others. [passage omitted] 
  During this economic work meeting, Governor Jia Zhijie held 
discussions with comrades in charge of prefectures and cities on 
this year's reform and development. Li Daqiang, standing 
committee member, explained the participants' demands and 
questions during the discussions.

  [Excerpts] A provincial meeting on combating corruption 
for a clean administration opened in Wuchang this morning. The 
meeting summed up the results of combat against corruption in 
units directly under the provincial authorities and made 
arrangements for the next step in combatting corruption. 
Provincial party Secretary Guan Guangfu expressed four ideas on 
further implementing central anticorruption instructions and 
carrying forward the province's anticorruption struggle. 
  Guan Guangfu said: The year 1994 is a year of reform in our 
province, a year of making endeavors, a year of implementing 
policies, and a year of clean administration. Party 
organizations in all localities throughout the province should 
strive to bring about a great change in party style and in 
practicing cleangovernment. This year of clean administration 
indicates the provincial party committee's determination to curb 
corruption and its utmost concern for anticorruption and clean 
administration. 
  Guan Guangfu pointed out: The deeper we carry out reform and 
opening up, the more necessary it is for us to combat corruption 
and practice clean administration. This gives expression to the 
nature of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Reform in the last 15 years has proved that only when 
corruption is severely curbed can we ensure the smooth carrying 
out of reform and construction. [passage omitted] This year is 
an extraordinary year, in which we face very arduous tasks. 
Whether or not all tasks can be implemented properly depends on 
whether or not leaders at all levels can cultivate a good mental 
attitude and a solid work style in organizing the masses for the 
fulfillment of all these tasks. [passage omitted] 
  Guan Guangfu requested: The current three anticorruption 
tasks should be further implemented so as to spend the Spring 
Festival happily in a clean atmosphere. To put it more 
specifically, there is a need for leading cadres to perform 
better in practicing clean administration and self-control, to 
increase momentum in cracking major and important cases, and to 
severely curb malpractices. Because the Spring Festival is 
approaching, we must increase the momentum of the fight against 
corruption. First, we must reduce meetings and commendation 
activities; unnecessary meetings must not be held and necessary 
meetings must be held in a simple way; second, no public money 
can be used for extravagant eating and drinking; third, the 
offering of gift money and gift checks is prohibited; fourth, 
the higher authorities, particularly institutions directly under 
the provincial authorities, are not allowed to accept native or 
special products offered by their subordinates; fifth, no public 
money can be used for highly expensive entertainment. 
  Guan Guangfu stressed: Institutions directly under the 
provincial authorities should play an exemplary role in the 
combat against corruption. The current fight against corruption 
is focused on party and government institutions, an law 
enforcement, administration, and economic management 
departments. Taking the province as a whole, attention should 
first be paid to institutions directly under the provincial 
authorities. [passage omitted] 
  In conclusion, Guan Guangfu requested: It is necessary to 
fundamentally resolve corruption and carry out long-term 
struggles against corruption. The fight against corruption is a 
prolonged task and involves comprehensive social systems 
engineering, which requires first, education, and second, law, 
for its thorough resolution. In the course of curbing 
corruption, there is a need to increase the momentum in cracking 
major cases, to gradually eliminate the ground and conditions 
for the emergence of corruption. At present, we must stress the 
following: First, we must pay attention to education, the 
implementation of regulations and policies, the improvement of 
structures, and the implementation of supervision and 
management, which all involve the overall situation; second, all 
levels of party committees and governments should strengthen 
their leadership, put the fight against corruption on their 
agenda and pay constant attention to it; and third, we must 
support discipline inspection work. 
  Ding Fengying, secretary of the provincial discipline 
inspection commission, also spoke at the meeting. Vice Governor 
Li Daqiang chaired the meeting. [passage omitted on names of 
other participants]

  [Excerpts] The provincial government held an economic work 
meeting in Wuhan today to discuss and arrange this year's 
economic work for the entire province. Governor Jia Zhijie, and 
Vice Governors Li Daqiang, Wang Shengtie, Han Nanpeng, Meng 
Qingping, Chen Shuiwen, and Su Xiaoyun attended the meeting. 
[passage omitted] 
  Governor Jia Zhijie made an important speech in which he 
first reviewed the 1993 economic work. He said: In 1993 the 
province registered sustained and speedy economic development. 
People throughout the province seriously implemented Deng 
Xiaoping's southern tour talks and the spirit of the 14th CPC 
National Congress, deepened reform and widened the scope of 
opening up, seized the opportunity for faster development, and 
blazed new trails in reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. 
  Jia Zhijie focused on the target of endeavor for 1994. He 
said: The general guiding principle for this year's economic 
work is this: Under the guidance of the spirit of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, we will conscientiously implement the 
instructions of the national economic work meeting and the Sixth 
Provincial CPC Congress, comprehensively deepen reform, widen 
the scope of opening up, bring into full play the leading role 
of large and medium-sized enterprises, pay attention to economic 
development, speed up the implementation of the scientific, 
technological, and educational strategy, promote scientific and 
technological progress and their structural adjustment, work 
hard to improve our economic results, and bring about the 
sustained, speedy, and healthy development of the province's 
national economy. [passage omitted] 
  Jia Zhijie pointed out: In ensuring the fulfillment of all 
national economic development tasks, we must break away from old 
conventions, create new ideas, and make new moves and 
breakthroughs. First, we must have new ideas in terms of 
development. Fundamentally speaking, we must explore a 
development method which requires little investment, produces 
much, yields good quality and results, and accumulates fast. 
Second, we must make a new breakthrough in terms of policy. At 
present, we must speedily formulate a number of detailed 
policies and methods for economic invigoration to encourage 
grassroots enterprises and masses to develop the economy. 
Third, we must have new moves in work. In other words, we must 
resolve the main contradictions and weak links and do something 
which can propel the overall situation forward. In this year's 
economic work we must pay attention to one nucleus, materialize 
five major breakthroughs, ignite three major projects, and 
alleviate the four major contradictions. 
  Namely, we must do our best to improve large and 
medium-sized 
state enterprises; develop a diversified economy by breaking 
away from old conventions, develop township and town enterprises 
by breaking away from old conventions, develop tertiary 
industries by breaking away from old conventions, develop 
individual and private economic sectors by breaking away from 
old conventions, and develop an export-oriented economy by 
breaking away from old conventions; ignite the production of 
automobiles, the transformation of the Wuhan steel factory, and 
the construction of other projects in coordination with the 
three gorges project; alleviate the fund shortage; and 
strengthen energy, transportation, and telecommunications 
construction. 
  Jia Zhijie said: According to these objectives and 
development ideas, this year's economic development must focus 
on the following aspects: 
  First, we must continue to strengthen the position of 
agriculture as the foundation, focusing on increasing the 
peasants' income and developing a diversified economy and 
township and town enterprises. We will initially arrange a 6 
percent increase over last year in the province's gross 
agricultural output value; a 37 percent increase in township and 
town enterprises' gross output value; a 100-yuan increase in the 
peasants' per capita net income; set a target of 23 to 23.5 
billion kg for grain output, and 500,000 metric tonnes for 
cotton output. To fulfill these targets, we must adjust and 
optimize the internal agricultural structure. [passage omitted] 
  Second, on the basis of improving economic results, we must 
maintain a speedy growth in industry. We will initially arrange 
a 15 percent increase in township industrial output value; over 
95 percent for their production and marketing rate; an 8 percent 
increase in budgetary enterprises' output value; and a 12 
percent increase in their fulfillment of taxes and profits. 
This year's tasks are arduous and we must take effective 
measures to fulfill them. For this reason, we must make great 
efforts to improve large and medium-sized state enterprises so 
as to provide powerful support for the speedy growth of 
industrial economy. [passage omitted] 
  We must increase the momentum of technological reform and 
update textile and other light industries. We must strengthen 
management over enterprises and improve their economic results. 
  Third, we must increase the momentum of investment, optimize 
the investment structure, raise funds through various channels, 
and make a success of key construction projects. The investment 
structure in fixed assets must be adjusted this year. [passage 
omitted] 
  Fourth, we must develop tertiary industries by breaking 
away from old conventions so as to form a new pattern for 
industrial growth. It is necessary to ensure an 11 percent 
growth in output value and to surpass the indices set by the 
plan. For this reason, we must develop industries which require 
small investments, can produce quick and good results, can 
provide adequate job opportunities, and have much to do with 
economic development as well as the people's lives. In the 
meantime, we must further stabilize our policies and support the 
development of individual and private economic sectors. 
  Fifth, we must give prominence to focal points and speed up 
market formation. 1) We must further improve commodity 
markets. 2) We must speed up the establishment of financial 
markets and gradually form regional financial centers. 3) We 
must actively develop labor service markets. 4) We must 
cultivate technology markets. 
  On expediting reform, Jia Zhijie said: This year, the 
macroeconomic and microeconomic fields, the economic base, and 
the superstructure will be reformed. We must actively and 
steadily carry out macroeconomic management system reform and 
ensure the smooth implementation of central reform measures. We 
must deepen enterprise reform with focus on the establishment of 
a new enterprise system. We must reform the social insurance 
system and the housing system, and we must speed up 
institutional reform. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At a provincial industrial and communications work 
meeting on 14 January, Vice Governor Meng Qingping pointed out: 
The general target for this year is to bring about a 15 percent 
increase in gross industrial output value and enable the 
production and marketing rate to reach 96 percent. To fulfill 
these objectives, there is a need to implement nine measures. 
  The first and foremost is to further emancipate our minds, 
change our concepts, and deepen reform. Meng Qingping 
particularly stressed the importance of stepping up the reform 
of state-owned enterprises. He said: In accordance with the 
plan of the State Economic and Trade Commission, this year Hubei 
will carry out a five-four-four-one program. Specifically, we 
will transform the operational mechanism of 500 large and medium 
enterprises; we will select 40 large and medium state 
enterprises for the implementation of the regulations on 
supervision over state assets and will form a new system under 
which the state exercises uniform ownership, the government 
exercises graded management, and the enterprise carries out 
independent operations; we will select 40 large and medium state 
enterprises for the trial establishment of a modern enterprise 
system under which government administration is separated from 
enterprise management and scientific management is exercised, to 
gain experience for the overall implementation of a modern 
enterprises system; and, in coordination with the relevant state 
department, we will select one city for a reform experiment 
which will reduce the enterprises' burdens and improve their 
circulating fund rate. 
  On enterprise reform, Meng Qingping pointed out the need to 
make major efforts to adjust the enterprises' organizational 
structure. On the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job in 
forming enterprise groups; on the other, it is necessary to 
promote the merger, reorganization, and combination of 
enterprises. In the meantime, a small number of enterprises 
that incur losses should be encouraged to announce their 
bankruptcy. Attention should also be paid to reforming the 
enterprises' operational methods. In the course of ensuring the 
taxation contract system's stable transformation into a new 
taxation system, it is necessary to increase the momentum of 
introducing the enterprise shareholding system, to popularize 
the practice of allowing state-owned enterprises to be run by 
civilians, and to encourage enterprises with the necessary 
conditions to carry out wage system reform and form limited 
liability companies or limited shareholding companies.

  [Text] Yichang, January 21 (XINHUA) -- Yichang city, in 
central China's Hubei Province, has been approved by the central 
government to be the latest open city along the Chang Jiang 
river. 
  The approval entitles the city to all the preferential 
policies granted to coastal open cities. 
  The decision is the most recent major step by the central 
government to speed up the construction of the Three Gorges 
Project on the middle reaches of the Chang Jiang river, as well 
as to accelerate economic development in the region. 
  Yichang administers seven counties, three districts and a 
state- owned farm, and has a total population of more than 3.9 
million. 
  The city is well endowed with water resources. In addition 
to the Chang Jiang and Qing Jiang Rivers there are other 99 
smaller rivers. The city's exploitable water power is estimated 
at 30 million kw. 
  Yichang is the location of three major water projects and 
hydroelectric plants under construction, with installed capacity 
of 2.71 million kw for the Gezhouba water control project, 1.2 
million kw for the Geheyan hydropower plant and 18.2 million kw 
for the Three Gorges Project, the largest in the country. 
  The city also has many tourist attractions, including the 
picturesque landscape in the Three Gorges area and relics of 
ancient battlefields of the Three Kingdoms period (220-280).

  [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton reiterated here today that he will firmly support Russia 
for its "allegiance to democracy" and its transition to a market 
economy. 
  At a 50-minute joint press conference held today with 
Yeltsin 
in the press center of Russian Foreign Ministry, Clinton said 
the the U.S. was ready to "work on some joint projects" with 
Russia. 
  One thing discussed in this Moscow summit was another aid 
package totalling 2.5 billion U.S. dollars to Russia and other 
former Soviet-bloc republics, Clinton said, adding that 70 
percent of the finacial support earlier promised in the 
Vancouver aid package is ready for delivery. 
  He said he was especially happy about President Yeltsin's 
unyielding stance to press on reforms in Russia, adding he and 
Yeltsin had discussed a number of ways for the U.S. and the 
world community to promote Russia's reforms. 
  When asked if he will drop his "shock therapy" policy, 
Yeltsin gave an immediate "no," adding "the reform will continue 
to be implemented in a resolute way." 
  Clinton said Washington was ready to help Moscow to lessen 
social hardships that appeared in the "shock therapy" reform 
process. This year, the U.S. Government will approve funds to 
shore up small private-run businesses in Russia and will 
accelerate the founding of a new fund for Russia's large-scale 
enterprises. 
  The U.S. commerce secretary will visit Moscow with a group 
of 
top executives from major U.S. companies on a trade mission to 
Russia next March, he said. 
  Clinton said he convinced Yeltsin of the "Partnership for 
Peace" idea in their last three rounds of talks. 
  Looking back on his past legs of European tour, Clinton said 
he hope his trip could help the construction of a new European 
security framework on the basis of free economy, common 
allegiance to democracy and mutual respect for territorial 
integrity. 
  Clinton said he was envisaging an highly integrated Europe, 
both politically, economically and from the point of security. 
  Clinton said he will again meet with Yeltsin during the G-7 
summit in Naples, Italy, next July and Yeltsin will visit 
Washington this fall.

as well as the fact that the agreement had been reached in a 
spirit of dialogue and compromise. 
  The communique underlined the conviction that the 
cooperation

  "It looks forward to the early fulfillment of this 
commitment, and to the agreement's early implementation, which 
will pave the way for the development of a full and fruitful 
cooperative relationship between Ukraine and the European 
Union," the communique said. 
  EU urged Ukraine to complete necessary legislative 
procedures 
for the above agreement to take effect as soon as possible and 
said it would "regard any delay with deep concern."

Favorable to Kiev's Ties With Moscow, Washington"] 
  [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- Russia, the United 
States and Ukraine signed here today an agreement on eliminating 
nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil, removing the major obstacle 
that has been affecting Kiev's relations with Moscow and 
Washington. 
  Following the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, 
Russia, 
Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus became heirs to the bulk of 
former Soviet nuclear arsenal. 
  Although Kazakhstan and Belarus had agreed much earlier to 
transfer all the strategic weapons deployed on their territories 
to Russia for destruction, Kiev had declined to do so due to 
controversies. 
  With 176 strategic missiles and about 1,500 nuclear 
warheads, 
Ukraine is the third largest nuclear power in the world after 
Russia and the United States. 
  So Moscow and Washington became deeply concerned over Kiev's 
unwillingness to give up its nuclear power status. 
  The concerns had increased after the Ukrainian parliament 
decided on November 18 that the country would only destroy part 
of its nuclear arms in the first stage and was prepared to 
become a non-nuclear state only after being secured against 
threats from other nuclear powers. 
  The parliament also urged the West to fund Ukraine in 
dismantling its nuclear weapons. 
  Taking common interests into consideration, U.S. Vice 
President Albert Gore visited Moscow in December to coordinate 
the two countries' positions in pressing Ukraine to give up all 
its nuclear weapons. 
  Meanwhile, Kiev was plagued by financial difficulties to 
effectively maintain the bulk of strategic weapons, especially 
after Moscow had refused to provide the spare parts needed by 
such maintenance. 
  Under such situation, Ukraine agreed to negotiate with 
Russia 
and the United States. But the talks had deadlocked on 
Ukraine's request for financial compensation for the destruction 
of its nuclear arms and for sharing with Russia the income from 
selling the uranium to be taken from the nuclear warheads. 
  The three sides had not made any major compromises on the 
issue until U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to Prague for a 
summit with leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and 
Slovakia earlier this week. 
  Ukraine finally agreed to destroy all the nuclear weapons 
deployed on its soil. In return, the United States will provide 
Kiev 175 million U.S. dollars for nuclear arms destruction and 
another 155 million in economic assistance, while Russia also 
agreed to allow Kiev to share the income from uranium sales. 
  Because of this, Clinton changed his itinerary and stopped 
briefly in Kiev on Wednesday to meet with Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk before flying to Moscow later the same day. 
  Kravchuk agreed to fly to Moscow on Friday for a summit with 
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin so that they could 
sign an agreement on the issue, which has been jeopardizing 
Kiev's relations with Moscow and Washington.

"Clinton's Trip to Moscow"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 17 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO)--U.S. President 
Clinton concluded his first official visit to Russia on 15 
January. The U.S. President and his Russian counterpart held 
talks on such issues as bilateral relations, European security, 
and the nonproliferation of weapons of massive destruction and 
signed a series of documents. President Yeltsin and President 
Clinton spoke highly of this visit and issued the "Moscow 
Declaration" to proclaim the advent of the "new stage of mature 
strategic partnership" between Russia and the United States. 
The press maintained that Russia and the United States had 
settled some problems in bilateral relations and coordinated 
their positions in international affairs through this summit, 
but they "failed to open up a new era in bilateral relations." 
  The timing of the Russo-American summit was not fortuitous. 
Over the past few years, the United States treated Russia as 
the major country for implementing "democratic values and a free 
economic system." The United States once again demonstrated its 
support for the "forces of democratic reform" when great changes 
occurred in Russia's domestic situation. Meanwhile, the United 
States fell short of its wishes in handling international 
affairs. It had to seek Russia's cooperation on the issues of 
establishing a new security structure in Europe and settling the 
problem of nuclear proliferation. On the other hand, Russia 
tried to work through this summit to strengthen its economic 
cooperation with the United States and to emphasize that power 
status was on an equal footing with the United States so as to 
"regain its external prestige." 
  Russia's economic reform was still the key item on this 
summit's agenda. As indicated by the results of Russia's 
parliamentary elections last December, the Russian people had 
exhausted the limit of their tolerance for the pain caused by 
reform and the opposition in the new parliament would strongly 
criticize any radical reform policies implemented by the 
authorities. The question of whether Russia would drastically 
change its economic policy in the face of this pressure was a 
U.S. concern. During the talks, President Yeltsin guaranteed 
that Russia would not slow the pace of market economic reform. 
Meanwhile, he did not overtly ask for direct aid from the 
United States but rather urged the United States to open its 
market to Russia, abolish trade restrictions left over from the 
Cold War period, and engage in economic and trade cooperation on 
an equal footing. President Clinton reaffirmed the U.S. firm 
support for Russia's "democratic market changes" and the 
fulfillment of the promise of granting aid to Russia that was 
made during the Vancouver Summit and afterwards. The United 
States agreed to reduce tariffs on over 4,000 Russian 
commodities. In addition, the two countries also reached an 
agreement on a $12 billion purchase of Russian uranium fuel. In 
the future, Russia will orient its economic policy toward 
society to a greater extent and will try to utilize every means 
to alleviate the pain of reform. People have noticed that the 
United States showed its understanding and support for this 
practice and declared that it would help Russia in this area, 
without making any new promises. 
  As a measure to "establish relations of mutual trust," the 
two presidents agreed that both sides would change the posture 
of targeting their strategic nuclear weapons on the other party 
by this May. The press considered that this decision signified 
the formal consent of the two nuclear powers to relax the state 
of alert which threatened to trigger off conflicts at any moment 
over the past few decades and that this decision was conducive 
to the further development of Russian-American relations. To a 
greater extent, however, this was regarded as a symbolic gesture. 
  The most eye-catching scene during Clinton's visit to Moscow 
was Russo-American cooperation in settling the issue of 
Ukraine's nuclear weapons. Russia, the United States, and 
Ukraine signed a formal agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons 
in Ukraine within a scheduled period of time. The press here 
was quite cautious in responding to this, however, saying that 
the agreement would be strongly opposed by the Ukrainian 
parliament. Russia's IZVESTIYA pointed out: In view of the 
mood of the Ukrainian parliament, it is impossible, in any case, 
to think that this problem has been solved. 
  Another focus of the Russo-American summit was the question 
of establishing a new security system in Europe. Under the 
present circumstances, good handling of relations with Russia 
has an important bearing on overall European security and 
stability. Because of this consideration, the NATO Summit -- 
which ended not long ago -- neither gave East European countries 
any guarantee of security nor worked out a clear timetable for 
these countries to join NATO. President Yeltsin expressed his 
support of NATO's "partnership for peace" plan and stated that 
Russia was willing to join the plan, thus opening up the path of 
extensive positive cooperation between Russia and NATO. An 
examination of the remarks made by President Yeltsin and 
President Clinton, however, reveals that the views of Russia and 
the United States on the new security system in Europe are not 
completely identical. Clinton stressed that East European 
countries would eventually join NATO through close cooperation 
and, on this basis, a unified Europe without new boundaries 
would be established. Yeltsin maintained that NATO's 
"partnership for peace" was only one of the new plans for the 
construction of a new Europe, and the role of collective 
security organs such as the CSCE should not be neglected. In 
addition, the United States and Russia still have divergent 
views on a number of issues, such as the question of whether 
Russia has a "special status" and "guiding power" in East Europe 
and in the CIS, the rights of Russian inhabitants in Baltic 
states, and the withdrawal of Russian troops from that area. 
  As commented by the press here, although the Russian and 
U.S. 
leaders said that they would consistently take new steps to 
establish a "strategic partnership" between the two countries, 
the prospects for this kind of relationship are still very 
uncertain. The future development of Russo-American relations 
hinges to a very large extent on Russia's political situation 
and changes in its foreign policy.

  [Text] Washington, January 18 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
today criticized Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's 
comment that Moscow should maintain a military presence in the 
Baltics as "at odds with" a recent joint U.S.-Russian statement. 
  "If they are accurate, we certainly will seek clarification 
from the Russian Government," State Department spokesman Michael 
McCurry said in reference to remarks reportedly made by Kozyrev 
to the Russian ambassadors to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. 
  Moscow has withdrawn all troops from Lithuania, but not from 
Latvia or Estonia. The three Baltic nations were under the 
jurisdiction of the former Soviet Union, but Washington had 
never recognized the legitimacy of this arrangement. 
  "Foreign Minister Kozyrev's comments are certainly at odds 
with statements signed by (Russian) President (Boris) Yeltsin 
and (U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton in Moscow," McCurry said. 
  McCurry's remarks came only hours after Kozyrev reportedly 
said that if Russia withdrew its troops, it would create a 
security vacuum in the region. 
  While asserting that the rights of ethnic Russians in the 
Baltic countries should be protected, Washington has all along 
demanded that Moscow pull its troops out quickly.

  [Text] Belgrade, January 17 ( XINHUA) -- A senior United 
States officer said Sunday [16 January] that American 
peacekeeping troops in Macedonia are determined to stop any 
invasion of the former Yugoslav republic, according to reports 
reaching here. 
  John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
made the remark in the Macedonian capital of Skoplje during an 
inspection of the U.S. barracks. 
  Shalikashvili said he was very satisfied with the vital role 
the United Nations peacekeeping forces have played in 
maintaining stability in the region. 
  Macedonia is the only former Yugoslav republic not involved 
in the civil war now raging in other regions. 
  In order to prevent the war from spreading to Macedonia, the 
U.N. Security Council decided in December, 1992 to dispatch 
peacekeeping forces to the country. There are 300 American 
soldiers now serving as peacekeepers in Skoplje.

rather change its form, Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri 
said on Monday [18 January]. 
  The minister was replying to a question as to how he viewed 
the U.S. future role in the region just before the visit of 
former U.S. President George Bush who is scheduled to arrive in 
Bangkok tonight as the guest of business tycoon Charoen Pokphand. 
  Prasong was quoted by the local newspaper "THE BANGKOK POST" 
as saying that there would be no official discussion between

<F P=106> ["LIAOWANG Forum" by staff commentator: "1993: China </F>
Secures an Advantageous Foothold in the Present World"] 
  [Text] The year 1993 was of special significance to China. 
I make this statement on the basis of two major events: 1) 
Asia's economy has grown rapidly. While trying their best to 
preserve their existing relative interests, Western countries 
have shifted their attention to the Asia-Pacific region. 2) The 
sanctions against China by the West have fallen through. 
China's important position in the world has been further 
established. 
  The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact 
indicated the withering away of a political and economic bloc 
and the disappearance of one of the two poles. It represented 
an "earthquake of a global scale." Immediately after the 
incidents, almost all countries, including developed and 
developing countries, reassessed their own strengths and the 
world situation to discover their positions on this celestial 
body. While repeatedly bringing pressure to bear on China in an 
attempt to topple socialist China and to create a "domino 
effect," the developed countries made greater efforts to start 
an economic war on a global scale to establish themselves as 
economic powers in the 21st century, a war which means a keen 
competition of the overall strengths of the countries involved. 
  Under the new situation, China met the challenge calmly and 
outmaneuvered the rivals wisely. The development in 1993 proved 
China's policy decisions and measures were entirely correct. 
  China arrived at a correct understanding of itself. A few 
years ago some people said that China, the United States, and 
the Soviet Union constituted a big triangle. The statement 
sounds reasonable from the political point of view. However, 
since China has a long way to go to adequately liberate and 
develop its productive forces and it still ranks behind many 
countries in terms of economic strength, the triangular 
relationship cannot be interpreted as a situation of tripartite 
economic confrontation. According to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
strategic idea, China will not reach the economic level of 
moderately developed countries until the middle of the 21st 
century. Even at that time, China's per-capita GNP level will 
still lag behind. Therefore, in handling the relationship 
between internal and foreign affairs, China puts emphasis on the 
former. Namely, China will initially try to succeed in internal 
affairs by focusing on economic development. China's foreign 
policy will naturally serve this central task. 
  This does not in any way mean that foreign affairs are not 
important. On the contrary, the task of carrying out foreign 
policy becomes more strenuous. To create a favorable 
international environment for its economic development, China 
has pursued an omnidirectional diplomacy. China is willing to 
establish and develop state-to-state relations with any 
countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, 
irrespective of their political systems and ideologies. This 
has enabled China to greatly expand its field of activity as 
described by the saying: "The wide sea allows the fish to leap 
about and the vast sky the birds to fly." 
  As a third-world country, China has maintained its 
traditional friendship with many other third-world countries in 
the world. While refusing to treat itself as a "leader," China 
has stressed time and again that it opposes hegemony and that it 
will never seek hegemony. Such a position wins sympathy and 
support from the broad masses of people in the third world. 
  China has made unremitting efforts to stabilize the 
situation 
in surrounding areas and has firmly pursued a good-neighbor 
policy toward surrounding countries. It has taken positive 
steps to solve territorial disputes. For instance, when Indian 
Prime Minister Rao visited China, the Chinese Government reached 
a consensus with him on preserving peace and security in the 
border areas. For those territorial disputes which defy 
solution for the time being, we proposed that "relevant parties 
shelve the dispute and join forces to develop the disputed 
area," thus creating a peaceful environment. 
  A favorable external environment has proved conducive to 
reform and opening up. After several years of rapid economic 
growth, China was still able to preserve the favorable economic 
momentum in 1993. The GNP increased by 13 percent, the foreign 
trade volume may beat the record figure of $190 billion, and the 
foreign capital actually absorbed in the January-October period 
stood at $17.2 billion. 
  With these achievements, China basically changed its 
position 
in 1993. 
  Some countries attempted to get China into trouble or to 
subvert it and regarded the human rights issue as the 
breakthrough point, but they ran into a stone wall. At the 
international human rights conference held in March this year, 
all the proposals against China went down the drain. On the 
contrary, a "declaration on development rights," which points 
out that right of development is an inalienable human right and 
which reflects China's consistent position was adopted by the 
conference. In the future, some people in some countries will 
continue to make an issue of human rights, but since their 
attempts have been seen through, they will not be as overbearing 
as before. 
  Toward the end of 1993, German Chancellor Kohl visited 
China. 
Soon after the visit, President Jiang Zemin met with U.S. 
President Clinton. These two events show that the West realizes 
that isolating China will not only put China in trouble, but 
also jeopardize their interests, with the result that they 
hastily wound up the sanctions against and the plan to isolate 
China. President Jiang Zemin's presence at the unofficial 
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization 
and his visit to Cuba, Brazil, and Portugal manifested China's 
enthusiasm for economic cooperation in the Asia- Pacific region, 
which holds a rosy future. President Jiang Zemin's trip also 
indicated China has extended its antenna to Western Europe and 
Latin America. 
  The world could not afford to ignore the existence of China 
as a political power long ago, and it also cannot afford to 
ignore China's economic prospects and potential. In the final 
analysis, state-to-state relationships are based on interests. 
Western countries cannot develop themselves by turning away 
from Asia, a huge and attractive market, while China is an 
important country in this region. American entrepreneurs, who 
are very sensitive and are optimistic about China, have made 
arrangements to expand business in China. Likewise, the 
Asia-Pacific region must develop themselves through intensifying 
international trade and economic cooperation. China has now 
further consolidated its foothold in the world because, apart 
from its political influence, its economy has become an 
important link in the global economy. Taking advantage of this 
favorable strategic position, China is now holding high the 
banner of "peace and development" in the international arena 
while holding high the banner of reform and opening up in the 
country and seizing on the favorable opportunity to expand. 
  In 1994 China will introduce a series of major reform 
measures. As a result, its economy will further converge with 
the world economy, its economic strength will continue to grow, 
and its international status will improve, thus enabling it to 
play a bigger role in the world. The sudden rise of a unified, 
powerful, and prosperous China in the East represents a 
historical trend which no force on earth can stop.

  [Text] Lhasa, January 17 (XINHUA) -- China's Tibet 
Autonomous Region experienced a robust economic upturn last 
year, according to Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the regional 
people's government. 
  Speaking at a regional economic working conference Sunday 
[17 
January], the chairman said that initial statistics show the 
gross domestic output last year came to 3.65 billion yuan, up 
8.1 percent over the previous year. 
  With some 80 percent of its population living in the 
pastoral 
and agricultural areas, and the output value of farming and 
animal husbandry accounting for 80 percent of the total, a 
sustained and stable growth in farming and animal husbandry is 
of vital importance to the region's economy at large, the 
chairman said. 
  According to him, last year was the sixth consecutive year 
that the region reaped bumper harvests, with agricultural 
output value reaching 2.23 billion yuan, a rise of 5.3 percent 
over a year earlier. 
  Meanwhile, he said, the region's animal husbandry last year 
maintained a stable development momentum, while rural and 
township enterprises saw healthy progress, which helped farmers' 
income increase by 5.1 percent to 515 yuan a year. 
  To ensure an economic uplift, the construction of a series 
of 
capital projects in the fields of energy, transportation and 
telecommunications was kicked off last year. The region's total 
investment in fixed assets last year stood at 1.59 billion yuan, 
up 15 percent over the previous year. 
  The expansion of Lhasa's Gonggar airport, whose runway is 
the 
longest in China, has been completed and the building of another 
airport is in full swing. 
  The renovation and upgrading of three highways leading to 
neighboring Sichuan and Qinghai Provinces, and Nepal was 
launched last year in a bid to improve contacts between the 
region and the outside, the chairman said. 
  Tibet is also accelerating the building of two hydroelectric 
plants. It has introduced the latest high technology to its 
burgeoning telecommunications industry. To date, 58 of the 71 
counties in the region have set up satellite-communication 
receiving stations and 35 of them have gone into use. 
Meanwhile, automatic switchboards have been installed in wider 
areas of the region's vast territory of 1.2 million sq km, 
Gyaincain Norbu said. 
  Following the country's reform and opening drive, foreign 
trade and tourism have turned out to be economic mainstays of 
the region. The trade volume topped 100 million U.S. dollars 
last year, 55 percent more than in 1992. 
  In recent years more tourist routes have been developed to 
tap the region's unique natural features. As a result, more 
than 26,000 overseas tourists visited Tibet last year, spending 
117 million yuan and 9.49 million U.S. dollars in foreign 
exchange, the chairman said. 
  As one way to speed up the development of the region's 
economy, Tibet is attaching increasing importance to enhancing 
ties with overseas countries and regions. The region last year 
approved over 40 joint-venture projects, involving a total 
overseas investment of 67.11 million yuan and 9.63 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  Thanks to the overall development of the region's economy in 
the past year, Tibet's financial revenue for 1993 is expected to 
reach 150 million yuan, up 37 percent over 1992.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher met at the Chinese Embassy here today with the two 
sides exchanging views on bilateral relations, disarmament, the 
prevention of proliferation of weapons, human rights, and other 
issues of common concern. 
  After the meeting, Qian Qichen and Christopher told 
reporters 
that the meeting was "positive" and "constructive." 
  At the talks, the two foreign ministers said that although 
the international situation has changed dramatically, they 
believed China and the United States are important and 
influential countries in the world. They still have many common 
interests and bear significant responsibilities in a broad 
field, including safeguarding international peace and security. 
The two sides agreed that the economies of the two countries 
have their own merits and advantages and that there are great 
potential and broad prospects in bilateral economic and trade 
cooperation. It is in the fundamental interest of the two 
nations to expand economic, trade, scientific and technological 
exchanges and cooperation. 
  The two sides believed that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's 
meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Seattle last 
November marked a good beginning for Sino-U.S. relations. 
Since then, thanks to the common efforts of both sides, 
exchanges of visits by important officials of the two countries 
had increased and bilateral economic and trade cooperation had 
been reinforced. Six U.S. congressional delegations have 
visited China since the beginning of this year. These visits 
are conducive to the promotion of mutual understanding and meet 
the interests of both sides. 
  The two sides also believed that the Paris meeting is of 
great immediate significance for maintaining the momentum of 
improved Sino-U.S. relations. The two sides agreed that Chinese 
Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu will hold official talks with 
U.S. Under Secretary of State Davis on 26 January in Washington; 
that U.S. Under Secretary of State Tarnoff will visit China in 
the near future for continued political consultation. Moreover, 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Shattuck will soon make a 
visit to China. 
  Qian Qichen handed to Christopher a letter from President 
Jiang Zemin to President Clinton. Qian Qichen reiterated an 
invitation for Christopher to visit China, to which Christopher 
expressed appreciation, noting that he was looking forward to 
visiting China at an appropriate time. 
  Present at today's meeting were Vice Foreign Minister Liu 
Huaqiu and U.S. Assistant Secretaries of State Lord and 
Shattuck. After the meeting, Qian Qichen and Christopher had 
one-on-one [dan du 0830 3747] talks for 40 minutes. 
  Qian Qichen arrived here on 22 January at the invitation of 
the French Government for an official and goodwill visit. After 
the meeting, Qian Qichen and his entourage left for home on the 
afternoon of 24 January.

  [Text] Beijing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen , who is also a vice-premier, returned here 
by air this morning from a three-pronged mission. It included 
visits to six African countries and to France and a meeting with 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
  In an interview at the airport here this morning on arrival 
from Paris, Qian told reporters that his three missions had gone 
well. 
  Diplomats here believe that Qian's effectiveness is 
impressive, since he has finished such important and intensive 
diplomatic missions with significant achievements within only 
half a month. 
  The first leg of Qian's foreign trip at the beginning of 
this 
year was his visit to Ethiopia, Eritrea, The Sudan, Kenya, 
Madagascar and Mauritius. This was also his fourth visit to 
Africa since he became foreign minister in 1988. 
  Since his first Africa visit in 1990, Qian has shuttled back 
and forth in the African continent and has by now visited 21 
African countries, about two fifths of all of them. 
  Qian's frequent visits to Africa are seen as visible proof 
that China pays great attention to the African countries' role 
in the international arena. To further strengthen and develop 
friendly relations and cooperation with the developing countries 
has always been vital for China's diplomatic policies. 
  While Qian was visiting East Africa, China and Lesotho 
resumed diplomatic relations, bringing to 159 the number of 
countries which have forged diplomatic ties with China. 
  While Qian was still in Africa, General Liu Huaqing, 
vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, paid an 
official goodwill visit to Thailand and Indonesia. 
  There were also important foreign visitors to Beijing. The 
Zimbabwean Parliament Speaker Nolan Chipo Makombe, Cambodian 
First Prime Minister Samdech Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime 
Minister Hun Sen, Japanese deputy prime minister and Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, speaker of the National Assembly of the 
Republic of Korea Lee Man Sup -- all visited China, one after 
another, during the first month of 1994. 
  This series of "comings and goings" shows the strong 
momentum 
of China's diplomatic activities. The visits also reflect that 
promotion and deepening of cooperative relations of mutual 
benefit with its neighbor nations and the developing countries 
is the key point of China's diplomacy. 
  Qian's France visit was an important high-level contact 
between China and France after the two sides issued a joint 
communique in mid-January, marking the normalization of 
bilateral relations. 
  Qian was "satisfied" with his meetings and talks with French 
President Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, 
and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, saying that the two sides 
achieved understanding on many issues, which "is of great 
importance to the relations between China and France and the 
other European countries as well." 
  Qian pointed out that many Western countries are intrigued 
by 
China's huge market, and that they are willing to take part in 
China's economic development. To strengthen ties with China has 
become a trend in the world, he added. 
  France has announced that Prime Minister Balladur is to 
visit 
China, and Foreign Minister Juppe also indicated that he would 
go to China in the near future. Their visits, if happening, 
will be major events in Sino-French relations and make the 
relations resume at a high level. 
  The 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French 
diplomatic relations falls on January 27, 1994. Over the past 
30 years, bilateral relations have experienced both progress and 
difficulties. 
  The issuing of a Sino-French joint communique and Qian's 
France visit unfolded a new page in the annals of bilateral 
relations. 
  Around Qian's visit to France, Qiao Shi, chairman of the 
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, has 
been in Europe on an official visit to Germany, Austria and 
Switzerland. 
  There is no doubt that both Qian's and Qiao's visit to West 
Europe will have extensive and positive impact on the 
development of the relations between China and West European 
countries. 
  The Paris meeting between Qian and U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and a visit to China by Lloyd Bentsen, U.S. 
secretary of treasury, are two important events between China 
and the United States. 
  During the three-hour-long talks, the Chinese foreign 
minister and the U.S. secretary of state exchanged views and 
achieved consensus on some bilateral and international issues. 
  Qian told XINHUA in the interview today that he and 
Christopher both held that through constant contacts, China and 
the United States should further increase their understanding of 
each other, narrow or even eliminate differences on some 
matters, including the most favored nation trade status issue, 
so that they would not hinder the development of bilateral ties. 
  Qian said the Sino-U.S. foreign ministerial meeting will be 
followed by more contacts between high-ranking officials from 
the two sides, and that bilateral exchanges will maintain their 
active momentum, which started last November when the Sino-U.S. 
summit meeting was held in Seattle.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Qian 
Qichen, Chinese vice premier and foreign minister, said here 
this morning that for some time in the future, China and the 
United States will need to make contact continuously to increase 
understanding and seek consensus. High-level contact between 
the two sides recently has increased and it is believed that 
this trend will continue. 
  Qian Qichen made the above statement at the airport this 
morning in Beijing on his return from Paris, in reply to a 
reporter's question about his talks with U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher during his visit to France. 
  He described the talk as constructive, saying that despite 
differences between China and the United States on issues such 
as the most-favored-nation status, both sides have the same 
wish, which is that this problem would be solved properly and 
prevented from interfering [gan rao 1626 2371] in the 
development of relations between the two countries. 
  Qian Qichen said: One of the international trends at present 
is strengthening relations with China. He said: The 
normalization of Sino-France relations carries great 
significance. Because the West European economies at present 
are not too good, they are all optimistic about the large 
Chinese market. France's decision to develop relations with 
China is undoubtedly a good thing. 
  Qian Qichen said: He had a talk with the French leader in an 
harmonious atmosphere and achieved satisfactory results. 
Consensus was reached on many issues and both sides stressed 
complete normalization in Sino-French relations. 
  On his tour of six African states, Qian Qichen said that 
many 
African countries are developing countries and have very good 
relations with China. China sets great store by developing 
relations with African states.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary from the "Report on Current Events" </F>
program: "Sino-U.S. Economic Cooperation and Trade Enter a New 
Era"] 
  [Text] Listener friends: In the past week, China and the 
United States reached a new agreement on textile products and 
resumed the Sino-U.S. joint economic committee talks, which had 
been suspended for six years. The opinion of Beijing is that 
the two events signify that the two countries have taken an 
important step forward in their march toward a new period of 
bilateral economic relations and trade. 
  Despite continuous trade frictions between China and the 
United States in recent years, an encouraging trend appeared in 
their bilateral trade. According to Chinese customs statistics, 
the bilateral trade volume increased by $10 billion from 1992 to 
reach $27.65 billion in 1993. The United States has always 
maintained its rank as China's third-leading trading partner, 
and the latter ranks as one of the major trading partners of the 
former. Meanwhile, the two countries have made gratifying 
progress in two-way investment and technical cooperation. To 
date, China has approved over 8,000 investment projects and a 
total agreed-upon amount of $10.8 billion by U.S. businessmen in 
China. In trailing only Hong Kong, the United States ranks as 
the second-leading nation in terms of its investment in China. 
A prominent characteristic of U.S. investment in China since 
last year is that increasing numbers of U.S. multinational 
companies are showing tremendous enthusiasm for investing in 
China. It has been learned that a number of companies among the 
top 500 U.S. firms have established considerably sizable joint 
ventures in China. 
  There is tremendous potential for the two countries to 
supplement each other in trade, for both sides can share each 
other's huge markets. The demand of China's domestic market 
will grow further as it enjoys economic development. 
  China's planned import volume for the period 1991-95 will 
exceed $400 billion. No one can deny that this import volume is 
very attractive to foreign enterprises, including U.S. firms. 
  Although a wide-ranging basis exists for China and the 
United 
States in their bilateral trade, people are soberly aware of the 
fact that the dispute raised by the United States every year 
over most-favored-nation [MFN] status for China from time to 
time casts a shadow on the development of bilateral trade. 
Chinese economists and businessmen say that the MFN issue must 
be solved once and for all if Sino-U.S. economic relations and 
trade are really to enter a new era. 
  The unfavorable trade balance is also a factor affecting the 
development of bilateral economic relations and trade. It is 
caused partly by differing statistical methods and partly by 
certain restrictions still imposed by the United States on its 
exports to China. It has been learned that both sides have 
agreed to establish a working group to settle their differences 
over statistical methods. Beijing figures believe that the 
momentum for a sharp increase in U.S. exports to China will 
occur if the United States scraps its policy affecting U.S. 
exports to China.

  [Text] Beijing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- Chen Xitong, 
secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist 
Party of China (CPC), praised the Beijing Matsushita Color CRT 
Co. Ltd (BMCC), a Sino-Japanese venture, for its rapid 
development. 
  Meeting with Ninagawa Chikayoshi, the outgoing general 
manager of the BMCC yesterday, Chen said that the expansion of 
the joint venture reflects the friendship between the two 
countries. 
  Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing, praised the general manager for 
his contribution to the venture's development. 
  The company, with a total investment of 500 million yuan, 
went into operation in July 1989. It has so far produced 7.42 
million color cathode ray tubes, and earned 4.52 billion yuan 
from sales with a net income of 1.03 billion yuan. 
  Chinese Premier Li Peng inspected the venture twice soon 
after it went into operation and encouraged it to become a top 
enterprise. 
  The BMCC plans to turn out 2.84 million color tubes this 
year, and its sales income is expected to exceed 2.2 billion 
yuan, up 560,000 and 700 million yuan from the 1993 figures, 
respectively. 
  The company will also improve its second assembly line to 
produce 170,000 high-clarity tubes by the end of the year.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ren Kan: "Bank of China To Receive $360m </F>
Loan From Japan"] 
  [Text] The Bank of China (BOC) yesterday signed agreements 
with the Export-Import Bank of Japan in Tokyo for a 40 billion 
Japanese yen ($360 million) recycling loan. 
  This is the second time China received a recycling loan from 
Japan since 1988 when the BOC received a 30 billion Japanese yen 
($270 million). 
  A recycling loan is money a country supplies to another to 
reduce its huge trade surplus. 
  China suffered a $7.46-billion trade deficit with Japan last 
year, compared with $2 billion in 1992. 
  The 20-year loan has a favourable interest rate, said an 
official with the BOC, the country's major foreign exchange bank. 
  Although the specific figure is not available, the official 
said the annual rate is less than 5 percent. 
  And Chinese loan recipients are not required to buy Japanese 
equipment. 
  The 40 billion Japanese yen is to be used to support more 
than 40 small construction projects in Qingdao, Shandong 
Province, and two large projects in Hainan Province, China's 
largest special economic zone. 
  The projects are mainly in the raw material, machinery, 
electronics and textile industries, which the country has vowed 
to give development priority . 
  The official said the Hainan Natural Gas Fertilizer Factory 
is to be the largest beneficiary, receiving 16.4 billion 
Japanese yen ($147 million). 
  The factory, with total investment of 1.47 billion yuan 
($168.9 million) will be put into operation in 1996. 
  The Hainan Changjiang Cement Factory also is to receive a 
substantial amount. 
  Analysts believe the construction of the two projects will 
ensure a solid industrial base for Hainan.

  [Text] On the evening of 22 January Gu Jinchi, secretary of 
the provincial party committee received Hwang Chang-yop, 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of 
Korea [WPK] of the DPRK, and his entourage in the Liaoning Youyi 
Hotel. 
  Both sides held cordial and friendly talks during the 
reception. Gu Jinchi said: After visiting Beijing, the capital 
of our country, and Guangdong Province, the WPK group headed by 
Secretary Hwang Chang-yop came to Liaoning to pay a friendly 
visit to our province and has brought us the profound friendship 
of the WPK and the Korean people. We feel extremely glad about 
another happy reunion of comrades and to be able to relive old 
friendships. I, on behalf of all party members and the people 
of Liaoning Province, would like to extend warm welcome to 
Secretary Hwang Chang-yop and the Korean comrades. The 
traditional friendship between the two parties and peoples of 
the PRC and the DPRK has been cemented with blood by the people 
of the two countries. It has been personally founded by the 
elderly leaders of the two countries. All party members and the 
people of Liaoning Province feel heartfelt happiness about the 
brilliant achievements scored in building socialist undertakings 
by the fraternal Korean people over the past long period under 
the wise leadership of President Kim Il-song and the WPK. The 
people of Liaoning Province, as elsewhere in the country, will 
make all-out efforts as before to consolidate and develop Sino- 
Korea friendship and to enhance the exchanges and cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  Gu Jinchi also briefed the guests on the province's 
situation 
in reform, opening up, and second-phase pioneering work. Hwang 
Chang-yop expressed appreciation for the achievements scored by 
Liaoning Province in the course of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  Attending the reception were Zhu Shanqing, deputy head of 
the 
International Liaison Department under the CPC Central 
Committee; Zhang Guoguang, deputy secretary of the provincial 
party committee; Xu Wencai, secretary general of the provincial 
party committee; Sui Xudong, director of the provincial foreign 
affairs office; and (Cho Ki-chun), consul general of the DPRK 
Consulate in Shenyang. 
  Secretary Hwang Chang-yop and his entourage arrived in 
Liaoning on 21 January. Their visit to China was at the 
invitation of the CPC Central Committee.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China 
have agreed to open direct air services between their capitals 
with Beijing agreeing to a control transfer point demanded by 
Seoul, South Korean officials said Tuesday. 
  But the two sides skirted Seoul-Beijing route, leaving it 
unsettled and agreeing to continued charter services. 
  South Korean Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae said these 
agreements, reached at working-level contact last week, will be 
made final at the aviation talks next month in Beijing. 
  Because the Seoul-Shanghai service is unsettled, the 
aviation 
agreement would have to be a temporary one, officials explained. 
The two countries also left untouched the number of airlines to 
service the Seoul-Beijing route and the beyond rights, putting 
them aside until next month's aviation talks, they said. 
  The aviation agreement is expected to be signed during 
President Kim Yong-sam's Beijing visit late March, and the 
Seoul-Beijing service may commence as early as April. 
  The control transfer point had blocked a successful 
agreement 
when Beijing insisted on ignoring the 124 degrees longitude 
drawn by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
and moving it to 125 degrees. 
  China conceded on the Beijing route at 124 degrees but 
insists on 125 degrees for Shanghai. The charter flights will 
have to keep using the corridor set up by Japan-China aviation 
agreement until further negotiations. 
  The 124 degree agreement for Seoul-Beijing will hopefully 
set 
precedent for flights linking South Korea with northern China 
such as Qingdao and Shenyang, officials said.

and opening in the 1990s. The greatest change that has taken 
place in Shanghai is its citiscape. Over $6 billion have been 
invested annually in Shanghai over the past several years, 
one-third of which was used for urban construction. When 
touching on economic cooperation with foreign countries, Huang 
Ju noted that Shanghai has the largest number of cooperation 
projects and the broadest fields of cooperation with big U.S. 
companies. Huang Ju expressed the belief that with the visit 
of Secretary Bentsen more U.S. businessmen will invest and 
engage in cooperation in China and in Shanghai. 
  Secretary Bentsen also delivered an ebullient speech.

Huaxin (0491 5478 2450): "Qiao Shi Meets With German Federal 
Assembly President Suessmuth"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 19 Jan (RENMIN RIBAO)--Chairman Qiao Shi of 
the Chinese National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee 
held talks with FRG Federal Assembly President Rita Suessmuth at 
the FRG Federal Assembly Building. The talks were conducted in 
a warm [re qing 3583 1906] and friendly atmosphere. 
  President Suessmuth warmly welcomed Chairman Qiao Shi's 
official friendly visit to Germany, and assessed highly the 
development of German-Chinese relations and the friendly 
cooperation between Germany and China in recent years. She said 
that the ties between Germany and China, especially since 1992, 
had been very close. Although the two countries were wide apart 
in distance, relations between them had been sound in the 20-odd 
years since the establishment of diplomatic relations. She 
indicated that German- Chinese relations maintained 
long-standing traditions, which were very important for the 
future too. She said that China was undergoing great economic 
reform, for which Germany had shown great concern. China had a 
population of 1.1 billion, with 50-odd nationalities. China had 
maintained stability and unity; that was a tremendous 
accomplishment not easily achieved. 
  Chairman Qiao Shi expressed his thanks for President 
Suessmuth's welcome on behalf of the FRG Federal Assembly. He 
said that the ties between China and Germany had a long history; 
such ties involved not only economic relations and trade, but 
also other fields, including culture and science. Since the 
PRC's founding, it had all along cared about developments in 
Germany, while paying attention to and showing concern for the 
reunification of the German nation. Therefore, when the new 
change came, we did not find it too sudden, and correctly 
handled the relations between China and Germany. Since 
diplomatic relations between China and Germany were established, 
their bilateral relations had enjoyed sound development, with 
all sorts of resistance gradually eliminated, and the bilateral 
relations of friendly cooperation accumulated and developed. 
Over the past few years, Sino-German economic and trade 
relations had been sound in their development. In 1992, the 
trade volume between the two countries rose to some $6 billion, 
and it was around $9 billion in 1993. At the same time, 
exchanges and cooperation in all arenas, including culture, 
science, technology, and education, thrived. Of course, in the 
course of making progress, difficulties were inevitable; 
however, the two countries had done their best to overcome 
difficulties; consequently, bilateral relations were forging 
ahead. Last November, Chancellor Kohl headed a large delegation 
visiting China, with satisfactory successes scored; thus a new 
phase of Sino-German relations has begun. 
  Chairman Qiao Shi indicated that the relations between the 
NPC and the German Federal Assembly had also developed 
continuously. Two vice presidents of the German Federal Assembly 
had already visited China, in addition to some other Federal 
Assembly members visiting China one after another. Because of 
the two sides' joint efforts, President Qiao Shi believed that 
his current visit would be successful. He formally invited 
President Suessmuth to visit China at a suitable time. 
  Chairman Qiao Shi said that China is developing; it has a 
vast territory and 56 nationalities; there are many aspects that 
call for Germany's understanding, and there is a need for mutual 
understanding and exchange of information between the two 
countries. He said that at present China was focusing its 
efforts on pursuing construction, and hoped for the maintenance 
of a peaceful and stable world environment. At home, China 
hoped to maintain long-range social stability; because without 
stability, China's economic and cultural construction would be 
out of the question. In more than a century of modern Chinese 
history, China had not really been unified and stable, and the 
Chinese people had to lead lives without stability while 
enduring great suffering. It was precisely because of this that 
China was implementing a peaceful foreign policy characterized 
by independence, taking the initiative in its own hands, and 
safeguarding Asia-Pacific and world peace, while maintaining a 
social environment of stability and unity internally. 
  Chairman Qiao Shi said that in the several years when the 
former Soviet Union was going through the most drastic changes, 
China had taken the road of reform. Taking the road of reform 
meant that at the beginning, the influence of the USSR had been 
done away with, while conducting political and economic reform 
according to China's actual conditions. In the 15-year reform, 
China's economy had been improved and would continue to be 
improved; furthermore, the people's political status had been 
greatly elevated; they could freely air their views, and their 
minds were at ease. He said that China was a vast country, and 
the central government's macroeconomic regulation and control 
were indispensable; at the same time, it was imperative to give 
full play to the enthusiasm of various localities. Those two 
aspects were equally important. Last year, China set forth the 
principle of building the socialist market economy, and the 
Constitution was revised at the NPC, with that point set down in 
the Constitution. That had great effects at home and abroad; 
and at the same time set arduous tasks for us. China was to set 
up the framework of the socialist market economy by the year 
2000; in the current NPC session, China must set up the legal 
framework of the socialist market economy. He indicated that 
the tasks for economic legislation would be numerous; and there 
would also be legislation in education, science and technology. 
China was doubling its efforts to do a good job of building its 
legal system. 
  Participating in the talks were major members of Chairman 
Qiao Shi's entourage Cao Zhi, NPC Standing Committee secretary 
general; Ye Gongqi, Shanghai Municipal People's Congress 
Standing Committee chairman; Redi, Tibet Autonomous Regional 
People's Congress Standing Committee chairman; Dai Jie, NPC 
Standing Committee member and concurrently NPC Financial and 
Economic Committee vice chairman; Vice Foreign Minister Jiang 
Enzhu; and Chinese Ambassador to Germany Mei Zhaorong.

<F P=106> [By Sue Green] </F>
  [Text] Fleet Street dubbed them the two generals: the 
tall, tough northerner who strode about London coatless in the 
cold, masterminding Labour's doomed election campaign, and the 
Tory campaign chief who won the war but lost the battle, failing 
to keep his own seat as his party regained power. 
  Now, in a twist of fate, those two men are on the same side, 
pushing the Hong Kong democracy barrow. 
  The Labour man, Dr Jack Cunningham, a scientist-turned 
politician, is Britain's shadow foreign secretary, in Beijing 
this week to tell China his party won't be taking its side 
against the British Government. 
  And the man he is lining up with, whose roof he slept under 
in Hong Kong, is none other than his old campaign foe, now the 
territory's Governor, Chris Patten. 
  "Someone asked me a very funny question at dinner the other 
night," says Dr Cunningham in his broad Geordie [northeastern] 
accent. "If Labour had won the election but I'd lost my seat 
would I be Governor of Hong Kong?" 
  He doesn't know the answer. And, strictly speaking, he 
cannot say for sure whether Labour will keep the present 
government's Hong Kong policy--and its choice of Governor--if it 
wins the British election due before 1997. But he thinks it 
unwise to dump either, and unlikely: "It's difficult to 
conceive of wiping the slate clean and starting again, 
especially if it's 1996," Dr Cunningham says. "A Labour 
Government in the future is not something I can make 
declarations about now but, speaking personally, my commitment 
is to these proposals and it is difficult to conceive of 
circumstances in which we would throw the whole lot out. And, 
for my own part, I don't think it would be sensible for us to 
come in and remove the Governor, put someone else in." 
  Dr Cunningham says a member of Mr Patten's family was amazed 
to hear him saying nice things about the Governor in a 
television interview: "I said yes, you wouldn't have seen me 
doing that two years ago." But two years is a long time in 
politics and Dr Cunningham, who represents Copeland in Cumbria 
and has been a member of parliament for 23 of his 54 years, is 
well accustomed to a system in which your former foes become 
your hosts. He and Mr Patten previously crossed swords when Mr 
Patten was environment secretary and he was Labour's spokesman. 
He sees their present roles as a curious twist of history. 
  He is quick to dismiss the notion that Mr Patten's high Hong 
Kong profile may be aimed at furthering his political future 
back home. He says a total breakdown of the China-Britain talks 
on Hong Kong, withdrawal of Mr Patten's reform package, 
undermining both him and Prime Minister John Major--perhaps 
fatally wounding the government-- would not be a good result for 
Labour. "The outcome of that is a Labour Government that has to 
resolve this problem and I don't think you can do that just by 
taking China's side," he says. 
  In fact, contrary to speculation that Chinese Embassy 
lobbying of MPs in London may be weakening support for Mr 
Patten's reforms, Dr Cunningham has made it clear to China he 
will not be backing it against the Tories. Asked if he had been 
lobbied in London, where he has met Chinese Ambassador Ma Yuzhen 
and Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, he said: "Not overtly," 
then added, "no, that's not quite true." China's view during 
those talks was that the Patten plan should be withdrawn. "I 
think they hoped we would come to that point of view but we did 
not and we have not and nothing that happened in Peking 
(Beijing) would lead me to recommend that course of action to my 
colleagues in London. "I regard the proposals as very modest. 
It is a bit difficult to concede that this is some huge gulf 
that cannot be bridged." 
  So, what achievements from his three days in Beijing, his 
first visit, does he have to report at today's shadow Cabinet 
meeting? Dr Cunningham says he learned a lot (references to his 
meetings with "Mr Rongji" at his Friday press conference showed 
there was definite scope to expand his knowledge of China) but 
says he did not know before he went why the Sino-British talks 
broke down; and he still does not know. 
  Those he met in China included Vice-President Li Lanqing, 
Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu, and director of the Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping. He has asked them to explain, 
in writing just how the Patten plan conflicts with the Basic Law 
and what amendments they want. "I just wanted to try to get a 
clearer understanding of the Chinese reasons for this stand over 
Hong Kong, the breakdown, and to make sure the Chinese were 
absolutely clear about my position and that of the British 
Labour Party, and to establish good personal relationships and 
contacts." 
  As a long-time politician, strategist, and media performer, 
Dr Cunningham could hardly be dubbed a straight talker. But he 
is willing to be blunt where it seems due. Like Mr Patten, he 
sees a conflict in the Chinese position: President Jiang Zemin 
says trade and politics should remain separate, yet China is 
dragging the airport issue into its political negotiations over 
Hong Kong. 
  To allow this standoff to lead to a series of protracted 
economic and trade disputes would be "pretty silly" he says. 
The end result? "A series of self-inflicted wounds." And while 
he says it is never too late to take up the issue of Hong Kong 
democratic rights, he concedes that should have been done years 
ago. 
  But to be fair, it was not just that British Governments did 
not take the initiative--the incentive to do so in Hong Kong was 
also lacking: "There's little doubt the approach of 1997 was 
the single biggest stimulus," he says. 
  It is not certain Dr Cunningham would become Foreign 
Secretary in a future Labour Government. He was given the 
shadow post despite coming just 12th out of 18 in the shadow 
cabinet poll. But he is a strong supporter of the Labour Leader 
John Smith and obviously has hopes of getting the job "if I was 
lucky enough to," he says. 
  If his entry in Who's Who is any sort of litmus test, Dr 
Cunningham has at least one qualification for taking a key role 
in the resolution of Hong Kong's future: Along with fly 
fishing, fell walking, and folk music, his hobbies include 
"listening to other people's opinions".

  [Text] Hopes rose last night that leading mainland 
dissident Wang Juntao might be one of three political prisoners 
China yesterday pledged to release "in the next few days". 
  Hong Kong-based human rights lobbyist John Kamm, speaking in 
Beijing yesterday, said mainland officials had confirmed their 
intention of freeing at least three prominent dissidents before 
Lunar New Year. 
  "I have received confirmation from the Public Security 
Bureau 
and another ministry that three prominent dissidents will be 
released in approximately 10 days," Mr Kamm said. 
  The authorities had declined to name the detainees involved, 
saying only that the legal process was underway and that the 
families would be informed in due course. 
  "It's possible that the Chinese are holding back on the 
names 
so that they can be announced in Paris," he said, referring to 
tomorrw's talks in the French capital between Chinese Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen and U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. 
  There has been widespread speculation that Wang, a leading 
figure in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, might be released. 
However, his relatives said yesterday they had received no 
notification from the authorities. 
  Wang, regarded by Beijing as a key organiser or "black hand" 
behind the demonstration in 1989, was sentenced to 13 years in 
jail in 1992. 
  Other leading candidates to go free could include 
41-year-old 
"black hand" Chen Ziming, also sentenced to 13 years 
imprisonment in 1992, and Bao Tong, the 59-year-old former 
right-hand man of disgraced Communist Party General Secretary 
Zhao Ziyang. 
  Bao was jailed for seven years in 1992 for "inciting 
counter- 
revolutionary activities" and "divulging state secrets" in the 
run- up to the Tiananment crackdown. 
  According to Mr Kamm, the authorities said they had also 
completed a preliminary response to a list of 235 political 
prisoners submitted by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for 
Human Rights John Shattuck. 
  Of the 235 names, the authorities said they had been unable 
to locate 100, while confirming that 40 others had been 
sentenced and were currently in jail, Mr Kamm said. 
  About 30 more had been released, while another 30 were under 
investigation. 
  While Beijing has in the past chosen to release prisoners 
around Lunar New Year, which falls on February 10 this year, any 
announcement over the next week could have important 
repercussions for U.S. renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation 
(MFN) trading status. 
  Washington has made renewal of MFN status conditional on 
significant progress in human rights issues, and the issue will 
be the focus of the Qian-Christopher talks in Paris.

Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter Sun Benyao (1327 
2609 1031)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee and president of the 
state, went on an investigative tour of the Emulation Center in 
Beijing this morning. During the tour, he said: While 
developing high and new technology, we should do everything to 
encourage cooperation between various sectors to make the best 
use of technology and improve the quality of research for 
promoting socialist modernization construction. 
  Early at the beginning of the new year, General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin made a special trip to the Beijing Emulation Center, 
located in the Second Research Institute of the China Aerospace 
Industry Corporation. The purpose of the tour was to 
familiarize himself with the development of the emulation 
technology, an advanced field in China's high technology 
industry, and to extend greetings to frontline scientists and 
technicians. 
  Emulation technology is a high technology field highly 
valued 
in developed countries. The technology, which can be used 
extensively in national defense and economic construction, is an 
indispensable means for studying, designing, testing, and 
evaluating complicated major industrial and engineering systems. 
With fairly comprehensive facilities and advanced technology, 
the Beijing Emulation Center is currently one of the world's 
leading emulation institutes, and its overall performance has 
already reached the global advanced level. 
  During the tour, General Secretary Jiang Zemin carefully 
observed the center's principal laboratories. He listened to 
the explanations of emulation experts and chatted with 
laboratory technicians, inquiring about their work, study, and 
everyday life. 
  At the end of the tour, General Secretary Jiang Zemin 
attended a discussion with emulation experts. After listening 
to a briefing, he spoke highly of the development of China's 
emulation technology and the Beijing Emulation Center's 
facilities. He extended the party central committee's cordial 
greetings to scientists and technicians working on the frontline 
of the aerospace industry, and exhorted them to redouble efforts 
at work and study so as to make fresh contributions to the 
advancement of China's high technology. 
  Zeng Qinghong, director of the General Office of the CPC 
Central Committee; Zeng Peiyan, deputy secretary general of the 
Central Financial and Economic Leading Group; and Liu Jiyuan, 
general management of the China Aerospace Corporation; 
accompanied the general secretary on his investigative tour.

  [Text] Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC 
Committee, together with some comrades from the provincial party 
committee general office, the policy research office of the 
provincial party committee, and the policy research office of 
the provincial agricultural commission, conducted surveys in the 
rural areas of Nanhai and Zhongshan cities from 5 to 11 January. 
They attended forums with local people and cadres to sum up 
experiences in the development of the rural joint-stock 
cooperative system invented by local people and cadres. 
  Xie Fei believes that this joint-stock system with the right 
to use farmland pooled together, which is currently practiced in 
the rural areas of Nanhai and Zhongshan cities, is innovative 
and a great reform of the land management system and has pointed 
out a new road for relatively economically developed areas to 
deepen reform, stabilize agricultural production, develop the 
secondary and tertiary economy, and realize the integration of 
urban and rural areas. 
  Xie Fei reminded the cadres that they should pay attention 
to 
several points when introducing the joint-stock cooperative 
system for land management: first, they should not be impatient 
and must judge whether conditions for introducing the system are 
available in their localities before they go into action; 
second, they should show respect for the peasants' choices and 
will; third, they should monitor the development and give 
positive guidance where the system has been introduced and 
practiced, and they should never take a laissez-faire attitude; 
fourth, pilot projects can be launched in the Zhu Jiang Delta 
area first, and then the system can be steadily popularized 
after more experience is obtained; and fifth, never should they 
resort again to the past practice of rushing headlong into mass 
action and that of egalitarianism and indiscriminate transfers 
of resources.

<F P=106> [By Qu Yingpu: "Inflation Helps Lift Urban Pay"] </F>
  [Text] China's employment continued its slow upturn in 
November while urban wages kept soaring as a result of 
double-digit inflation. 
  By the end of November employment stood at 147.716 million, 
slightly more than the 147.533 million in October but 203,000 
fewer than at the beginning of this year, according to the State 
Statistics Bureau. This figure is for all non-agricultural 
workers. 
  The bureau's latest report said that by the end of November 
State industries had cut their payrolls by 56,000 to 108.833 
million from the beginning of this year, but they still grew by 
154,000 compared with October. 
  Of the workers in State industries, 74.07 million held 
permanent jobs, down 1.54 million. But those working under 
contracts increased by 1.721 million to 22.306 million. The 
rest held temporary jobs. 
  Collective enterprises reduced payrolls by 688,000 to 35.524 
million, while foreign-funded and private firms added 541,000 
workers to raise their total employment to 3.359 million. 
  Meanwhile, wages paid out in the first 11 months of 1993 
totalled 395.52 billion yuan ($45.46 billion), 21.8 percent more 
than during the same period in 1992. 
  Of that total, State industries paid 309.99 billion yuan 
($35.63 billion), up 21.9 percent. Collective enterprises paid 
71.76 billion yuan ($8.25 billion), up 15.1 percent. And 
foreign-funded and private firms paid 13.76 billion yuan ($1.58 
billion), up a hefty 73.5 percent. 
  In another development, November's retail price index--the 
country's most important inflation indicator--rose 15.1 percent 
over the same month the previous year. The cost-of-living index 
increased by 16.7 percent in Novermber. 
  The retail sales index for consumer goods rose 15.2 percent, 
while at State-owned commercial outlets the index rose 14.5 
percent. The retail sales index for consumer goods at free 
markets also increased by 16.7 percent.

  [Text] The cost of living in major cities rose by 23.9 
percent last month over December last year, according to the 
State Statistical Bureau. The bureau said yesterday that in 35 
major cities, prices of consumer goods increased 17.2 percent 
and those of major services climbed 38.6 percent. Earlier 
estimates of urban inflation for 1993 were 19.5 percent. 
  Meanwhile, the value of industrial output in December jumped 
29.8 percent over the same month last year, further pressuring 
prices, the bureau warned. In releasing the monthly figures, 
the bureau said: "In December, China's industrial output 
increased significantly; retail sales were prosperous but price 
rises were serious and inflationary pressure expanded." 
  "This (29.8 percent) is close to the peak level registered 
before (the Government) introduced its macro adjustment 
policies," it said. 
  The bureau also said China's total industrial output value 
reached 3,507 billion yuan (HK$3,113 billion) last year, up 23.6 
percent. In the same period, stateowned enterprises performed 
worse than collectively-run enterprises and township ventures, 
the bureau said. Collectively run enterprises reported an 
increase of 39.8 percent in output value while stateowned 
companies managed an increase of just 8.9 percent. 
  Township enterprises increased output by 57.6 percent.

<F P=106> [By reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Jan (XINHUA) -- The results of the 
individual appraisal of the country's first batch of intangible 
assets were announced in Beijing today. Prices were set for the 
goodwill, trademarks, and products of six Chinese and foreign 
enterprises. Great Wall Hotel's goodwill value is 260 million 
yuan; Beijing's Yeguangbei Distillery's goodwill value is over 
53 million yuan; Hainan Provincial Airlines' goodwill value is 
202.9 million yuan; Hainan's Pisike [0572 2448 0344] 
International Air Sightseeing Club's goodwill value is 107 
million yuan. 
  Sun Yuehuan, general manager of the Beijing Jiacheng Assets 
Appraisal Company, which announced the aforementioned results, 
told this reporter that the so-called intangible assets refer to 
copyright, patent rights, service trademarks, trademark rights, 
goodwill, and other nonmaterial assets. He said: The value of 
the intangible assets of many world-renowned enterprises is much 
higher than the value of their tangible assets and annual sales 
volumes. In China, people currently have not placed adequate 
importance on intangible assets. The value of the intangible 
assets of some enterprises with high goodwill, famous 
trademarks, and well-known brand names is very high; if their 
intangible assets are neglected in property right transactions 
and in other economic activities, their economic losses will be 
enormous. 
  Some experts have said: As China opens its doors wider to 
the 
outside world, as enterprises strive to develop modern 
management systems, and as market competition becomes fiercer, 
increasing numbers of enterprises will place greater importance 
on their intangible assets. Intangible assets are an important 
factor for making investment in foreign countries, for 
reorganizing enterprises into joint stock companies, for 
protecting enterprises' own interests, and for expanding 
enterprises' influence. When an enterprise's property rights 
are transferred due to making joint investment or to merger, 
reorgnization, or sale of the enterprise, its intangible assets, 
which do not appear on its account, must not be overlooked if 
the value of its property is to be correctly estimated.

<F P=106> ["The Fifth Provincial Party Committee Convenes Its 10th </F>
`Enlarged' Plenary Session"] 
  [Text] The fifth provincial party committee held its 10th 
(enlarged) plenary session in Hefei from 13 to 17 December. The 
session's main purposes are to further study and implement the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; to convey and implement the guidelines of the 
national economic meeting held by the State Council; to 
summarize the work of 1993; to study and formulate ways to 
further deepen reform in an effort to establish a socialist 
market economy; to optimize restructuring; to raise efficiency; 
and to continually maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development. 
  Attending the session were members and alternate members of 
the provincial party committee; members of the provincial 
advisory committee and the provincial discipline inspection 
commission; party members who are responsible comrades from the 
provincial people's congress standing committee, the provincial 
people's government, and the provincial Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference committee; principal 
responsible comrades from party committees and governments of 
various prefectures, cities, and counties (districts); and 
principal responsible comrades from various provincial-level 
departments, various universities, and some large enterprises 
and institutions. 
  The provincial party committee standing committee chaired 
the 
meeting. Lu Rongjing and Fu Xishou delivered important speeches 
at the meeting on implementing the guidelines of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 
national economic meeting. Chen Guanglin made a progress report 
on Anhui's anticorruption drive. The provincial advisory 
committee submitted a written work report to the meeting. 
  The third plenary session adopted the "Resolution on 
Implementing the `14th CPC Central Committee's Decision on 
Several Issues Regarding the Establishment of a Socialist Market 
Economy' [the "Decision"]"; and adopted the "Resolution on the 
`Anhui Provincial Party Committee Advisory Committee's Work 
Report'," agreeing to abolish the provincial advisory committee. 
  The meeting held: The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee was an important meeting held at a time when 
reform in China's economic system was entering a new phase. The 
"Decision" -- adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee -- has sketched the basic framework of a 
socialist market economy; is a splendid blueprint for 
transforming the traditional planned economy into a socialist 
market economy; and is an action program that guides us to 
promptly accelerate the pace of reform and progress. In 
accordance with the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, the national economic meeting 
has made specific arrangements for various reform and economic 
tasks in 1994. Party committees and governments at various 
levels must earnestly study the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; must adhere to the 
national economic meeting's arrangements; and must pay close 
attention to and meticulously organize related tasks so as to 
realistically and properly perform them. 
  The meeting proposed: The general guiding ideologies and 
requirements for the work in 1994 follow: We should earnestly 
implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics; should persistently intensify 
anticorruption drive while carrying out reform, opening up, and 
economic progress; should further liberate the mind; should 
seize opportunities; should accelerate the pace of reform in an 
effort to expeditiously establish a socialist market economy; 
should open wider to the outside world; should maintain the 
favorable momentum of rapid economic progress while ensuring 
that quality and efficiency in 1994 will be improved over that 
of 1993; should considerably raise the provincial comprehensive 
strength; and should improve our work performance in various 
fields. 
  The meeting pointed out: To properly perform the work in 
1994, we have to accomplish very arduous tasks. While regarding 
reform as the main theme, we should make efforts to do a good 
job in the following aspects: 1) We should expeditiously 
smoothen the relations between producers and enterprise owners 
and strive to invigorate state enterprises in an effort to 
establish a modern enterprise system. 2) We should accelerate 
rural economic restructuring and strive to raise peasants' 
income in an effort to realize the goal of becoming well-off. 
3) We should expeditiously develop factor-of-production markets 
and strive to enable market mechanisms to play their full roles 
in an effort to optimize resource allocation. 4) We should 
accelerate the pace of opening up to the outside world and 
strive to enhance the export-oriented economic sector in an 
effort to reach a situation whereby the economy is open in an 
all-round manner. 5) We should expeditiously develop scientific 
and technological progress, make use of related achievements, 
and strive to increase high-technology levels in an effort to 
transform scientific and technological achievements into 
economic benefits. 
  The meeting pointed out: Reform is progress. We cannot 
achieve economic progress unless we have breakthroughs in 
reform. We should make greater efforts to accelerate reform; 
should earnestly study various central reform policies; should 
fully understand their guidelines; should make use of favorable 
conditions from a macroeconomic viewpoint; should be fully 
prepared; and should strictly implement the guidelines. 
Meanwhile, we should actively create conditions through our own 
efforts and effective work; should strive to seek opportunities 
for progress under a new relationship among various interest 
groups arising as a result of reform; and should use new reform 
breakthroughs to enhance rapid economic progress. We should 
realistically change our concept of economic progress, and 
should earnestly shift to performing the central tasks of 
restructuring and raising efficiency. 
  The meeting stressed: Strengthening party organizations at 
various levels and raising the leadership's ability to regulate 
the overall situation in accordance with the party's basic 
theories and basic line are important guarantees for us to 
establish a socialist market economy. All Anhui residents 
should thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In particular 
at present, we should earnestly and properly study Volume 3 of 
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Leading cadres 
should lead the study so that we can conscientiously reach 
common understandings on Comrade Xiaoping's theories and the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress. We should further uphold 
the ideology and line on liberating the mind and on seeking 
truth from facts; should continually eradicate backward ideas 
that are incompatible with development in the new situation; 
should respect the masses' creative spirit; and should summarize 
and promote fresh experiences initiated by the masses. 
Furthermore, we should unwaveringly and persistently uphold the 
policy of simultaneously and strictly launching the 
anticorruption drive while carrying out reform, opening up, and 
economic progress. We should intensify ideological and 
political work; should strictly crack down on various crimes; 
should continually launch the anticorruption drive; and should 
ensure that we accomplish related achievements at various 
stages. Additionally, we should continually strengthen the 
party's own development, especially development in leading 
bodies and grass-roots organizations; and should raise the 
rallying force and fighting capacity of party organizations at 
various levels so as to more appropriately fulfill the 
requirements for reform, opening up, and modernization in the 
leadership. 
  The meeting earnestly deliberated the provincial advisory 
committee's work report. The meeting fully affirmed and highly 
commended the provincial advisory committee for its enormously 
effective work, since its establishment, on enhancing Anhui's 
reform, opening up, and modernization drive; on fostering party 
building and spiritual civilization drive; and on consolidating 
a stable and united political situation. The meeting also 
expressed lofty respects to veteran comrades of the provincial 
advisory committee for their important personal contributions to 
abolishing the previously existing permanent leading posts, to 
replacing old cadres with new ones, and to facilitating 
cooperation between the two groups. The meeting urged party 
organizations at various levels to be more concerned for old 
comrades politically and in their daily lives; to pay attention 
and listen to their suggestions and proposals; and to 
continually attach importance to the roles they will play in the 
future. Meanwhile, the meeting expressed the hope that old 
comrades will be concerned with and support, as they have 
previously, the work in various sectors, and will make fresh 
contributions to enhancing Anhui's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive.

pushing the province's national economic growth onto a new 
stage, and making new breakthroughs in the province's various 
trades and professions.

  [Text] Moscow, January 14 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today outlined three major tasks for Russia -- building 
a genuine market economy, adhering to democracy, and keeping its 
previous role on the international scene. 
  In a live TV address at the major Ostankino TV and Radio 
Company here, the U.S. President expressed his admiration for 
Russian literature and art, its ballet and space industry. 
  He said Russia and the United States are bound to make their 
contribution to the consolidation of "the spirit of cooperation 
and partnership" throughout the world, and improvement of 
everyday life of each individual. 
  However, he stressed that Russians themselves are to make 
their own future. 
  The U.S. people and President want to be "partners and 
sincere friends" of Russia, he said. 
  On the Russian economy, the U.S. President agreed that 
transition to market economy was "painful and difficult, and 
could "disorient" Russian citizens. 
  However, he continued, Russia would have to pay more for 
being idle or trying to turn back, and state-controlled economy 
does not work in the modern world. 
  He also said the high inflation rate in Russia must be 
curbed 
and Russia needs to create a system of social guarantees for 
people affected by swift economic development. 
  The U.S. President pledged that his people will do their 
best 
to help alleviate the difficulties by making more investments in 
the country. 
  Many people gathered in the Ostankino studio to meet the 
U.S. 
President, television pictures showed.

<F P=106> [Article by Tsung Lan-hai (1350 5663 3189): "CPC Decides on </F>
Its International Archenemy"] 
  [Text] Whom does the CPC regard as its international 
archenemy? 
  It is the United States. 
  This is the case today. What about tomorrow? 
  Regardless of the prospects for their own political lives, 
they are now picking and choosing the archenemy in 26 years time 
(i.e. the year 2020). 
  Is it still the United States? 
  There are divergent views on this question. Those from the 
leadership think tank share a general view: Japan. 
  This view was disclosed in a document issued by the CPC 
Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. 
<H3>  Twenty-three Departments Participated in a Symposium on 
Developments in the International Situation </H3>
  During the period from 25 November to 5 December 1993, the 
General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the General 
Office of the Central Military Commission held a symposium on 
the development of the international situation. During the 
symposium, discussions were conducted on the development of the 
world situation, China's position in today's world, the 
challenges China may face in the next century, and the 
polarization pattern in the world. The symposium was held at 
the Jingxi Hotel. 
  Among the units participating in the symposium were 23 
departments and organs, including such organs under the CPC 
Central Committee as the Research Group on International 
Relations, Research Group on Diplomatic Relations, Research 
Group on Relations With the United States, Research Group on 
Relations with Japan, Research Group on Relations with Western 
Europe, Research Group on Relations With Russia, and organs 
under the Central Military commission, such as the Research 
Office on International Strategy, Research Office on European 
and American Strategy, Research Office on Asian Military 
Intelligence, Research Group on Far East Strategy, Research 
Office on National Defense Military Strategy, the Operations 
Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters, and the 
Research Office for Strategic Studies. 
  A total of more than 60 papers were published at the 
symposium. 
<H3>  Many Central Leaders and Senior Statesmen Attended the 
Meeting </H3>
  The symposium was attended by many leaders of the CPC 
Central 
Committee, including Qiao Shi, Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, Chi 
Haotian, Zhang Wannian, Hong Xuezhi, Cao Shuangming, Zhang 
Lianzhong, Zhao Nanqi, Ding Guangen, Wen Jiabao, Wei Jianheng, 
Tao Siju, and Jia Chunwang. Among the senior statesmen present 
at the symposium were Bao Yibo, Wan Li, Li Desheng, Gu Mu, Xiao 
Ke, and Zhang Aiping. The 11-day symposium was presided over 
respectively by Yang Dezhong, Wang Ruilin, and Li Ji. 
  At the meeting, participants reached a consensus on the 
assessment of the current international situation, the threat 
from the international community toward China from the present 
stage till the beginning of the next century, China's major 
rivals in the year 2020, and China's stance on its sovereignty 
over Hong Kong. 
  Discussions were also unfolded and different opinions and 
comments made on a number of issues, such as the future 
development of Sino-Russian relations, whether or not China 
should offer economic aid to Russia (to boost the bilateral 
relations), the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Sino-U.S. 
relations, China's stance in the United Nations, China's ties 
with Third World countries, China's relations with India and 
Indonesia, as well as China's ties with Germany and French. 
<H5>  "The Major Target of U.S. Hegemonism Is China" </H5>
  On the basis of the above consensus, the symposium drew a 
number of conclusions, one of which read: From the present 
stage to the beginning of the next century, the major target of 
U.S. hegemonism and power politics is China and Third World 
countries in Asia. Its strategy toward China is to, through 
economic activities and trade, control and sanction China and 
force China to change the course of its ideology and make it 
incline toward the West; take advantage of opening up, personnel 
exchanges, and propaganda means to make ideological infiltration 
into China's upper strata; give financial assistance to hostile 
forces both inside and outside Chinese territories and wait for 
the opportune moment to stir up turbulence; support and 
encourage western groups to impose economic sanctions against 
China with a view to reaching their political goal; fabricate 
the theory of a China threat toward neighboring Asian countries 
to sow dissension between China and countries like India, 
Indonesia, and Malaysia; and manipulate Japan and South Korea to 
follow U.S. strategy toward China. 
  However, things may look different in 20 years' time. 
<H3>  Over 60 Percent of Participants Regarded Japan as China's 
Archenemy </H3>
  During the symposium, over 60 percent of the participants 
believed that by the year 2020 Japan would surpass the United 
States in economic strength and become a new economic empire. 
Restricted by Japan's lack of nature resources, militarist 
forces inside the country will grow alongside economic 
development; when its military strength and armaments go beyond 
its needs for self-defense and reach a nondefensive stage, Japan 
will surely challenge China politically and militarily. By that 
time, the United States will change its policy from utilizing, 
inciting, and manipulating Japan to follow its strategy to 
supporting Japan's policy and strategy toward China. Under the 
present situation where the Soviet Union has disintegrated and 
Russia faces an unclear future in its political and economic 
reform, Japan's military development, which was previously aimed 
at preventing Soviet aggression, will take China as the target. 
Based on its economic as well as scientific and technological 
strength, which are constantly growing, Japan will engage in 
arms expansion and become the world's largest military power by 
the year 2020. Japan will rank first in the world in per capita 
military expenditure, 25 times higher than China. 
  However, regarding Japan as China's archenemy in 2020 was 
not 
the only view expressed at the symposium. 
<H3>  A Quarter of the Participants Still Consider the United 
States as China's Major Rival </H3>
  A quarter of the participants still consider U.S. hegemonism 
and power politics as China's greatest rival in 2020. In 
addition to continuously subverting and interfering in China's 
internal affairs through the means of ideological propaganda, 
the United States can also make use of Japan and South Korea to 
present military challenges to China. The United States is 
still the world's only military power, the leader of the western 
alliance, and the biggest backstage boss of political interests. 
  Besides Japan and the United States, some people also keep 
an 
"imaginary enemy" in their mind. 
<H3>  About 10 Percent of Participants Believe That Russia Is 
Going To Be China's Most Dangerous Enemy </H3>
  During the symposium, less than 10 percent of the 
participants held the view that Russia will become China's most 
dangerous enemy by the year 2020. They based this view on the 
adjoining territories of China and Russia, where a vast part of 
Chinese territory is inhabited by minority nationalities, on 
territorial disputes between the two countries, on Russia's long 
desire for China's territories, and on ideological differences 
between the two countries. 
  When discussing China's relations with foreign countries, 
the 
issue of China forging an alliance with other countries was also 
brought out into the open. With a view to coping with China's 
present and future enemies, some people raised the idea of 
playing the Russia card. 
<H3>  "Rebuild a Friendly Cooperative Relationship Between China 
and Russia" </H3>
  It was noted by many participants in the symposium that, 
judging from ties and strategic positions between nations, it is 
not practical for China to give up the chance to enter into an 
alliance with other countries. To serve the purpose of 
safeguarding China's national interests and social system, it 
suits China's interests to build nonideological allied relations 
or enter peace and cooperation treaties with Third World 
countries or Russia on the basis of mutual assistance, mutual 
benefit, and non-interference. Those present at the symposium 
also suggested that China should provide economic aid to Russia 
and CIS countries in order to rebuild a friendly cooperative 
relationship with Russia. They believe that building up a 
friendly cooperative relationship with Russia is the most 
practical strategy to adopt to contend with U.S. strategy toward 
China, and is also a strategy to guard against the revival of 
Japanese militarism in 2020. 
<H5>  Veteran Generals Have a Tendency To Play the Russia Card </H5>
  A number of papers and data became the focus of the 
symposium, including a paper entitled "On Japan's Strategy 
Toward and Influence on China in the Year 2020," which was 
written by the Research Group for International Relations under 
the CPC Central Committee; a paper entitled "On Japan's Strategy 
Toward China in the Next Century," which was prepared by the 
Research Office for International Strategic Studies; papers 
under the headings "Japan Lists China as Its Number-One 
Political Enemy" and "Factors Leading to Anti-China Wars By 
Japan," which were published by the Research Office for Asian 
Military Intelligence; papers entitled "Japan's Influence on and 
Ambitions Toward Taiwan" and "the Realities of the Revival of 
Japanese Militarism," which were released by the Research Group 
on Far East Strategy; as well as data prepared by the Operations 
Department of the PLA General Staff Headquarters under the 
heading "the Development and Strategy of Japanese Military 
Strength" and "Japan Possesses the Technology and Equipment To 
Produce Nuclear Weapons." 
  All the veteran generals who attended the meeting had a 
tendency to play the Russia card, suggesting that China further 
promote its ties with Russia at an appropriate time. Military 
personnel who once studied in the Soviet Union even favored the 
idea of providing Russia with substantive economic aid to make a 
good impression on Russia. 
  During the symposium, the CPC Central Committee and the 
Central Military Commission submitted a 63,000-character, 
five-part final report under the heading "Analysis of This 
Symposium on the Current International Situation as well as 
Future Changes in the World Setup." 
<H3>  Reflecting the CPC's Feeling of Isolation in the 
International Community </H3>
  A person in the know said privately after the meeting that 
this symposium served to reflect the CPC's present isolated 
position in the world, the feelings of the CPC's decisionmaking 
level of being cut off by the international community under the 
present situation where communism is declining, and the CPC's 
urgent desire to seek allies to resist the world-wide historical 
tide of democracy. He indicated: "However, it will prove a 
mistake if China picks Russia, for Russia is not the Soviet 
Union but `the former Soviet Union,' still less the Soviet Union 
of the Stalin era. This is one reason. The other reason is that 
China is faced with many variables, and who can guarantee that 
China will still be a 'socialist' paradise by the year 2020?" 
  This person hates foreign aggressors bitterly, especially 
Japanese militarists. He believed, however, that once China is 
able to get onto the normal track of history and becomes 
powerful and rich, no enemy would scare China.

  [Text] Chengdu, January 19 (XINHUA) -- The economic growth 
of southwest China's Sichuan Province picked up in 1993 with a 
GDP of 18.66 billion yuan, a hefty 12.8 percent rise over the 
previous year, according to an on-going meeting. 
  The province, for the first time, had an annual revenue of 
over 20 billion yuan, the participants were told at a meeting of 
the provincial people's congress which opened here on Tuesday. 
  Sichuan is one of China's largest provinces, with the 
biggest 
population in the country. It is also among those which first 
carried out the reform and opening policies in the late 1970s. 
  Despite natural disasters last year, the province achieved 
the record harvest for three years in a row, with a total grain 
output of 43 million tons. 
  The agricultural output value of the province in 1993 
reached 
a total of about 84.6 billion yuan, 1.5 percent increased over 
the previous year. 
  The township enterprise sector also grew fast last year, 
with 
an annual output value of nearly 19.2 billion yuan, a healthy 95 
percent rise from the year before. 
  The development of the province's industry again picked up 
and achieved good returns last year. 
  The amount of the industrial output value above the township 
level last year hit over 21.26 billion yuan, a 20.9 percent 
surge from the previous year; that of retail sales more than 
20.42 billion yuan, with a 21.2 percent rise. 
  Over the past few years, the province also took strong 
measures to promote its opening to the outside world and 
expansion of exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries. 
  So far, it has economic ties with more than 120 countries 
and 
regions and set up sister-city relations with 33 cities around 
the world. 
  The province's exports and imports in 1993 totalled over 2.9 
billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 32.6 percent on the year 
before, including total exports of 1.65 billion yuan, 11 percent 
higher than the figure of the previous year. 
  In addition, it had 1,910 new joint ventures, with a 
contracted overseas investment of 2.4 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The province also quickened the pace in boosting the 
development of its service sector last year, and signed 
contracts of 600 million U.S. dollars for new projects and labor 
services. 
  With a sharp economic growth, the living standards both of 
the urban and rural residents in the province has also greatly 
improved. 
  The average annual income per capita of the urban residents 
reached 2,172.8 yuan in 1993, a sturdy 20.2 percent rise, while 
that of the rural residents hit 695 yuan, increased by 61 yuan 
from the previous year. 
  Savings deposits of local residents throughout the province 
totalled 71.35 billion yuan, 22.8 percent up on 1992.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Chinese authorities have reportedly improved the 
treatment of internationally known dissident Wang Juntao, 
further increasing the chances that he might be released on 
"medical bail" by the Lunar New Year. Sources in Beijing said 
police and hospital authorities had allowed the 35-year-old 
dissident, who has been staying at the 302 Military Hospital 
since early last year, more "freedom of movement". 
  Two other dissidents are expected to be released or granted 
medical bail in the coming fortnight in an apparent effort by 
Beijing to secure Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status from 
Washington. According to the veteran human rights lobbyist, 
John Kamm, one of the three will be from outside Beijing. But 
officials from the Foreign Ministry and Justice Ministry have 
denied knowledge of any planned releases. 
  Sources in the capital said yesterday that Wang, who had 
previously been confined to a well-guarded room, could now walk 
freely around the hospital. Moreover, his rights to visits by 
family members were now on a par with ordinary patients there. 
"Food and medical supplies for Wang have generally improved, and 
the relative freedom of movement recently granted him could be a 
sign of his impending release," an informed source said in 
Beijing. 
  The source said that when Wang, who was sentenced to 13 
years 
in 1992 was transferred to the hospital, it was clear he would 
not be returning to prison. "It is not too big a step from 
letting Wang serve out the rest of his jail term in a hospital 
to granting him medical bail on humanitarian grounds," he said. 
  Another candidate for medical bail is Bao Tong, once the 
principal secretary of the ousted party chief, Zhao Ziyang. 
Bao, 59, was given a seven-year sentence in 1992 for "counter- 
revolutionary instigation and propaganda". But since he was 
detained in May 1989, Bao has already served more than half of 
his term, which is a ground for magnanimity in the Chinese penal 
system. 
  Dissident sources said the third candidate for early release 
might be the student leader, Liu Gang, or the Reverend Pei 
Zhongxun. Liu, who is serving the last two years of a six-year 
sentence at a prison in Liaoning province, was a prominent 
student leader in the 1989 democracy movement. Human rights 
organisations say Liu, 32, has been tortured in prison. Like 
Wang, Liu's name has appeared in most lists given by foreign 
governments to Beijing for consideration for early release. 
  Pei an ethnic-Korean evangelical minister, was arrested in 
1985 and given a 15-year term in a Shanghai prison for allegedly 
"spying for Taiwan". Sources in Shanghai said since he was in 
his mid-70s, the authorities might grant him medical bail. 
  Western diplomats said of the three, the release of Wang, 
alleged to be a key organiser of the 1989 demonstrations, would 
have the most impact on both the American administration and 
Congress. In his Seattle "summit" with President Jiang Zemin 
last November, President Bill Clinton mentioned Wang when they 
discussed human rights. Meanwhile, Mr Kamm said in Hong Kong 
yesterday the Chinese authorities had told him earlier this 
month "a few tens" of dissidents were under investigation or 
awaiting trial.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Give Consideration to the </F>
Well-Being of Future Generations--Further Talk on Doing a Good 
Job of Promoting Family Planning"] 
  [Text] In recent years, under the correct leadership of 
the party Central Committee and the State Council, marked 
results have been achieved in the field of promoting family 
planning in our country. The excessively rapid growth of the 
population has been effectively brought under control. This is 
a major step for creating a favorable population environment for 
accelerating reforms and developing the economy. However, work 
to promote family planning still faces many difficulties and 
problems. On the whole, the work remains in the uphill stage, 
and we must not, even to the slightest degree, relax our 
efforts. A noteworthy fact is that some comrades do not clearly 
understand the current situation and have not made a cool-headed 
analysis, and they overestimate our achievements in the family 
planning field over the past years and are excessively and 
unrealistically optimistic as they think that work to promote 
family planning will not require too much effort. Thus, they do 
not pay much attention to this work. This is a problem to which 
we must pay serious attention. 
  General Secretary Jiang Zemin recently pointed out: In our 
country, which was a feudal society for over several thousand 
years, it is not easy to break with the worn-out concept of 
continuing the family line by producing a male heir and 
regarding men as superior to women. In addition, peasant 
households need a male labor force and peasant couples need sons 
to support them when they get old. We must be fully aware of 
the arduousness and prolonged nature of family planning 
promotion work. Leading cadres at all levels should seriously 
understand this important instruction and should persistently 
conduct propaganda and education so that people may better 
understand that the population issue may seriously affect the 
level of economic development in per capita terms. We should 
give consideration to the well-being of future generations. 
Family planning should be carried out in every family and be 
effected by every couple of child-bearing age. This certainly 
requires painstaking and unswerving efforts. The present low 
birth rate is not stable. Because the masses have not 
thoroughly changed their attitude toward childbearing and some 
actual difficulties in their livelihood have not been thoroughly 
settled, if our efforts are slightly relaxed, the birth rate 
will rebound immediately. Localities where work to promote 
family planning has achieved good results are no exception. The 
base population of our country is large, and a third population 
growth peak exists in the 1990's, which means that the net 
population increase each year will reach some 14 million people. 
According to the population plan for the Eighth Five-Year Plan 
period and the 10-year population plan, by the end of this 
century, even if our work in promoting family planning is done 
very effectively, the population of the Chinese mainland will 
still be close to 1.3 billion people. According to 
calculations, the national population will not stop increasing 
until it reaches 1.6 billion people in the middle of the next 
century. Therefore, no one can brag that the population can be 
completely brought under control in the next few years or even 
in the next few decades. We must keep ourselves sober-headed on 
this issue and adopt a realistic attitude. While fully 
affirming the achievements in our work, we should also dare to 
face problems squarely and notice the deficiencies, and we 
should continue to analyze new conditions and solve new problems. 
  This year is an important year for the implementation of the 
Eighth Five-Year Plan in our country. We should conscientiously 
carry out a target management responsibility system for 
population control and family planning, persistently carry out 
existing birth control policies and population plans, intensify 
inspection and supervision, strictly assess work results, and 
actually give awards and penalties to those who deserve them. 
At present, population statistics remain inaccurate and 
unreliable so it is necessary to find out the actual situation, 
and we must carry forward our party's fine tradition and work 
style of seeking truth from facts. We advocate that all of us 
should behave honestly and must not practice fraud or try to 
deceive ourselves as well as others. Cadres at all levels 
should hold a realistic and responsible attitude for the benefit 
of the people, actually improve their style of work, go deep 
into the realities of life and grass-roots units, carry out 
effective investigations and studies, and actively spread 
scientific methods. 
  At present, the work of promoting family planning should 
still be focused on the vast rural areas. It is necessary to 
continue to make great efforts to promote family planning in all 
rural villages and grass-roots units. Cadres in village party 
branches and villagers' committees should be mobilized to do 
painstaking, careful, and effective work. We should constantly 
follow the mass line in our work, serve the people 
wholeheartedly, and correctly handle the relationship between 
work effectiveness and work intensity. Rural work in other 
fields should be properly linked with the work of promoting 
family planning, and they should promote each other so that we 
open up a road of effectively coordinating population growth 
with socioeconomic development.

  [Text] According to the General Staff Headquarters of the 
Chinese People's Liberation Army [PLA], the PLA's successful 
training reforms last year have prompted vast number of officers 
and men to take an active part in high-tech warfare training. 
  After Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin 
exhorted the vast number of commanders and fighters, especially 
high-ranking officers, of the armed forces in telling them they 
must strive to study modern technology, especially high and new 
technology, the offices of all PLA headquarters, military 
colleges, and field units alike have all launched programs for 
studying high technology. 
  According to statistics, the armed forces sponsored more 
than 
2,000 collective high-tech training classes last year, and the 
tactical exercises carried out were unusual compared to those of 
many previous years in terms of their high degree of difficulty. 
  The General Staff Headquarters believes that 1993 was a year 
in which the PLA reformed and developed its military training.

  [Text] At the trade talks in Washington, officials from 
Taipei, in explaining our government's stance to the U.S. side, 
insisted that temporary tariff cuts can not be imposed on the 
185 farm products of the 699 items proposed by the United 
States. As for the 514 industrial products, tariff on about 70 
items can be reduced under the relevant provisions of the 
Customs Import Regulations. 
  Commenting on the (?light) products on which tariff 
reductions have been agreed upon, Director Huang Yen-chao of the 
Industrial Bureau said the bureau is mapping out plans to decide 
on the items to be levied with reduced tariffs. According to 
the explanation given by Industrial Bureau officials to the U.S. 
side at the trade talks, preparations can be completed within 
about two months. Hence, based on this estimation, Taipei is 
expected to officially announce in March temporary tariff cuts 
on industrial products, which Washington has demanded. 
  Moreover, Director Huang disclosed that the delegation from 
Taipei already clearly explained the difficulty of temporary 
tariff cuts on 185 farm products, and that import duties on 70 
of the 514 industrial products can possibly be reduced under the 
relevant provisions of the customs law. However, he said, the 
reduction rates have not been decided yet. 
  Sources from the Executive Yuan's Agriculture Committee 
disclosed that the U.S. response was not very favorable. The 
delegation from Taipei proposed a remedial plan and pledged to 
revise the administrative and legislative procedures for the 
customs tax regulations to reduce customs tax for import items 
whose tariff cannot be cut by half under the provisions of 
Article 47 of the Customs Law. However, legislation for such 
revision can be completed only after October of this year at the 
earliest. As for whether or not Washington is willing to accept 
the remedial plan, Director Huang Yen-chao did not further 
elaborate.

  [Text] Taipei, Jan. 25 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister 
P.K. Chiang Tuesday [25 January] said the government will 
respond within two weeks to the US request for lower tariffs in 
Taiwan. 
  The government will initially cut customs duties on certain 
products in accordance with the customs tariffs law, under which 
tariff reductions are subject to approval by the Legislative 
Yuan, Chiang noted. 
  Chiang pledged that the Executive Branch will seek the 
legislature's cooperation in bringing down customs duties in 
order to ensure Taiwan's full membership in the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this year. 
  Taiwan's bid to join the Geneva-based trade regulating body 
calls for tariff concession negotiations with GATT contracting 
parties. Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 
1992. 
  Meanwhile, Taiwan's bilateral tariff concession talks with 
the United States under the GATT framework are likely to be held 
as scheduled in February. 
  Huang Yen-chao, Director general of the Board of Foreign 
Trade, made the remark late Monday upon his return from tariff 
consultations with US officials in Washington, D.C. 
  During last week's consultations, Huang said he told the 
American side that Taiwan could lower import duties on 70 
industrial products in accordance with the customs tariffs law. 
But whether the tariffs could be slashed up to 50 percent was 
unknown, he added. 
  The United States demanded in November that Taiwan cut 
customs duties on 699 items by up to 50 percent. Of the 699 
items, 514 are industrial goods and 185 are agricultural 
products. 
  Though no concrete agreements were reached during the 
consultations, Huang pointed out, the two sides have exchanged 
views on tariff reductions. "I therefore would not rule out the 
possibility of holding GATT tariff negotiations with the United 
States next month," he said. 
  The US originally said it would not talk with Taiwan on 
GATT- 
related tariff issues until its own tariff-cut request was met. 
The United States viewed its request for lower tariffs on the 
699 items as separate from the GATT tariff talks.

  [Text] Fake currencies have been flooding the Chinese 
market, causing widespread concern among law-enforcement 
agencies. Counterfeiters are now using advanced technology to 
make fake notes and water stamps, according to security sources. 
  The Putuo branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank in 
Shanghai confiscated forged banknotes valued at more than 20,000 
yuan from January to June last year. The bank estimated all its 
14 branches in Shanghai could seize more than 300,000 yuan of 
bogus money in a year as the forged notes kept flooding the 
market. Sources close to the police said laymen would find it 
difficult to tell if the notes were genuine. 
  In an attempt to prevent the banknotes from circulating, 
banks in China will confiscate all the forged notes when 
enterprises and individuals turn in their counterfeited notes. 
The forged notes usually get into the market through business 
transactions. People who accidentally get banknotes will have 
to bear the loss. Some victims said they preferred getting fake 
goods to fake money. Experts in the field of finance said the 
authorities had to enhance the awareness of businessmen and 
citizens to counterfeit currencies. 
  Counterfeiters also illegally print and sell invoices which 
resulted in a disruption of the financial system. Sources said 
some enterprises had commissioned unauthorised or underground 
printing plants to produce invoices to cheat tax departments. 
The invoices are also being used by unscrupulous civil servants 
and businessmen to claim expenses. 
  The authorities have raided many printing plants in 
different 
areas and have seized printing equipment, half-finished 
products, and end products of unauthorised invoices. Recently, 
the tax department of Chengdu, Sichuan province, raided 743 
state-owned and private printing plants in the area, and 39 were 
found to have been involved making fake invoices.

<F P=106> [By Li Wen: "Guangdong Curtailing Illicit Trade in </F>
Currency"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou--Government officials in Guangdong are 
putting the brakes on the illegal trading of foreign exchange 
futures by financial consultancies. 
  Ji Guoyan, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Futures 
Supervision and Administration Commission, said such illegal 
trading is plaguing China's fledgling futures market. 
  "Owing to an imperfect management system and inexperienced 
traders, the market provides some openings for speculators," Jin 
said. 
  Aiming to stop the illegal practice, about 20 officials from 
the province's futures regulatory organizations and the 
Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau recently 
launched a surprise night attack on six companies in Guangzhou. 
  Most such companies rent offices in the most expensive 
buildings in downtown Guangzhou, like the International 
Building, the International Finance Building, and the World 
Trade Centre. 
  All six companies were caught doing futures trading, which 
goes beyond their authorized business scope as stipulated by the 
local industrial and commercial bureau. 
  Inspectors found evidence that the companies were helping 
clients buy and sell foreign exchange through computers 
connected to foreign swap markets. 
  The companies' registered business certificates clearly 
specify that they confine themselves to providing information or 
advice on real estate, engineering and finance. This means they 
are not entitled to deal in foreign exchange trading. The six 
companies were ordered to stop operating and to return client's 
cash deposits within 30 days. 
  Since the Bank of China authorized Guangzhou to open foreign 
exchange futures trading last year, the province has been very 
careful in issuing licenses to companies. 
  Among the 156 future companies in the province, only 12 are 
authorized to deal in such business. 
  With a registered capital of HK$50,000 ($6,400), approved 
and 
registered companies can help clients conduct margin trading 
with cash deposits of HK$4 million ($512,000). 
  Some companies have no connections with international 
futures 
trading exchanges. Others hire unqualified dealers and cheat 
their customers. 
  According to a local magazine, residents of the affluent 
Pearl River Delta region have been cheated of more than HK$1 
billion ($130 million). 
  To prevent such abuses, futures companies must now operate 
from two sides: overseas companies provide the investment and 
brokers, and the Chinese side administers. 
  The State Foreign Exchange Administration last June ordered 
all futures companies listed with the State Industrial and 
Commercial Administration Bureau to be checked and re-registered.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (XINHUA) -- A spokesman of the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office under the State Council issued a 
statement on the new airport issue in Hong Kong here today. 
Full text follows: 
  The Hong Kong British authorities, regardless of the 
opposition by the Chinese side, allowed the Hong Kong-British 
Legislative Council (Legco) to pass a bill last week for 
allocating 1.67 billion Hong Kong dollars for the new airport 
project before any agreement has reached between China and 
Britain on the financial arrangement for the new airport and 
went on to decide to apply with the Legco for another 
appropriation of 4.6 billion Hong Kong dollars. 
  According to the present financial arrangement for the 
airport project by the British side, the debt to be left over to 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1997 will run 
up to well over 45 billion Hong Kong dollars, which will be nine 
times the total debt limit set in the memorandum of 
understanding signed by the heads of government of China and 
Britain. 
  By continuing to apply for fund allocation when the whole 
financial arrangement by the British side have already violated 
the memorandum of understanding, the Hong Kong authorities are 
in fact creating further obstacles to the talks on the Hong Kong 
new airport project. 
  The Chinese side hereby declares: 
  Before any agreement on the financial arrangement for the 
new 
airport project has been reached by the two sides: 
  1. The Chinese side and the government of the future Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region will not be liable for any 
expenditure and debt incurred by building the new airport; 
  2. The land to be used and the prices of the land, including 
the land to be occupied by the new airport and the land to be 
used along the railway line leading to the airport, must be 
leased through the discussion of the Sino-British Land Committee 
according to the provisions of Annex 3 of the Sino-British joint 
declaration; 
  3. All the contracts associated with the new airport project 
that cover the time beyond June 30, 1997 approved by the Hong 
Kong British authorities without the consent of the Chinese side 
will be invalid after July 1, 1997; 
  4. Any law or ordinance associated with the new airport 
project adopted by the Hong Kong British Legislative Council 
will become invalid after July 1, 1997; 
  The Chinese Government has always supported the construction 
of a new airport in Hong Kong. In order to separate political 
issues from economic ones, it has approved the project of making 
land from the sea at Wanchai, central, and the project of 
sea-bed tunnel at the western harbor. The Chinese side regrets 
for the British side's repeated breach of the agreement reached 
between the two governments. But the Chinese side still hope 
that the British side would earnestly deliberate the positive 
proposals raised by the Chinese side on reducing costs and debts 
and strengthening management and supervision and produce a 
financial arrangement which tallies with the spirit of the 
memorandum of understanding so as to facilitate the restoration 
of the talks on the new airport issue.

"Lu Ping Talks About Three Issues, Criticizes British Side for 
Lacking Sincerity in Cooperation"] 
  [Text] In an interview with a delegation of young 
entrepreneurs of Fujian origin from Hong Kong on 15 January, Lu 
Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, 
touched on the Sino-British talks, Hong Kong's economic 
situation, the airport issue, and Hong Kong's liabilities. This 
reporter has compiled his discussion as follows. 
<H5>  Hong Kong's Economy Is Full of Vitality </H5>
  Lu Ping said: Hong Kong's economic situation is not bad of 
late. The stock market fell two days ago but went up again 
yesterday. How the market will perform today remains unknown. 
Naturally, the stock market cannot fully reflect Hong Kong's 
economic situation, but it certainly can to a certain extent. 
So it indicates that Hong Kong people are confident of Hong 
Kong's future and are optimistic about the mainland's opening 
policy. This is one of the reasons for foreign funds flooding 
into Hong Kong's stock market. The fact that a large amount of 
U.S. and Japanese funds flooded into Hong Kong shows American 
and Japanese investors are upbeat about Hong Kong and China. 
Some people say that the 21st century belongs to Asia, and I 
believe this assessment is entirely correct. Many people are 
upbeat about various countries in Asia, especially Hong Kong, 
which enjoys unique conditions. Hong Kong has been regarded as 
a stepping stone or a window because foreign countries which 
plan to open up markets on the mainland must do so through Hong 
Kong, while the mainland must also expand market accessibility 
for its products in Western countries through Hong Kong. So 
Hong Kong plays a special role in this respect, a role which is 
not shared by other Asian countries such as Singapore, Thailand, 
and Malaysia. I am of the opinion that Hong Kong's economy will 
always be full of vitality despite political disputes. Hong 
Kong has experienced several setbacks in the past. When the 
West was bogged down in an economic recession, Hong Kong was 
inevitably affected. But it was Hong Kong that first recovered 
from the effect of economic crises. Hong Kong has survived 
every setback this way in the past. 
  Lu Ping continued: Now that there is a China factor, China's 
economic development is having greater and greater impact on 
Hong Kong. The mainland is a huge potential market and has a 
strong appeal to foreign countries. German Chancellor Kohl 
signed quite a number of contracts with China when he visited 
China with many German entrepreneurs not long ago. China and 
France recently published a joint declaration in which France 
promised not to sell weapons to Taiwan in the future. When 
attending a meeting in Seattle, President Jiang Zemin met with 
U.S. President Clinton. All this indicates that foreign 
countries take great interest in China's market. Nevertheless, 
Britain is now falling far behind other foreign countries in 
this regard, but other people can do nothing about it. Our 
policy is that we hope British consortia will remain and develop 
themselves in Hong Kong. We recently reiterated this position 
to a visiting delegation from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. 
I told them: You British consortia have done business in Hong 
Kong for over 100 years. You have contributed to Hong Kong's 
economic development in the past, so we hope that you will stay 
and expand your business in Hong Kong and continue to make 
contributions to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. This is 
only our desire, but cooperation calls for mutual agreement. 
<H5>  Without Mutual Desire There Would Be No Cooperation </H5>
  Cooperation concerns two parties. If the British side 
refused to cooperate with us, we could do nothing about it. 
Cooperation calls for enthusiasm from both parties. I have 
often cited the following example: We used to see in Beijing 
streets barbers carrying a shoulder pole with a burning stove at 
one end, which was used to heat up water for giving the customer 
a shampoo, and at the other end a barrel of cold water. There 
would be no cooperation if only one party was enthusiastic about 
it, like the barber's shoulder pole, which only had a burning 
stove at one end instead of both. We feel it is really a pity 
that the Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral 
arrangements broke down due to a lack of sincerity on the 
British side. As far as we are concerned, the door to the talks 
is open at all times. We have formally told, through the 
foreign ministry, the British side our willingness to resume the 
talks on the condition that the partial electoral bill which had 
been tabled in Legco (Legislative Council) be withdrawn, because 
the bill has not been agreed by both sides. As everyone knows, 
the British side has always acted this way: It presented a 
certain bill to Legco for discussion while bringing pressure to 
bear on the Chinese side. After Legco has made a decision on 
the bill, it would say: You see, Legco has passed the bill, so 
it cannot be amended. If this was allowed, is there any point in 
holding talks? If what Legco decided on counted, was there any 
need for negotiations? So their tactics as mentioned before are 
absolutely not allowed. It is known to all that Legco is 
entirely controlled by the British side. 
  We could follow their example by presenting a certain bill 
to 
the NPC Standing Committee for deliberation while the bill is 
being discussed by both sides. If the NPC adopted the bill, we 
could also say the bill cannot be amended because the NPC is the 
organ of supreme power. If both sides acted this way, would it 
be of any use to open negotiations? Such is the conduct of mean 
people rather than of gentlemen. We feel it beneath our dignity 
to do so, although we can if we choose to. In April last year 
we set the following precondition before the talks began: No 
Legco deliberation of the problem under bilateral discussion is 
allowed; should this principle be violated, the talks would be 
suspended. Now that they have knowingly violated this 
principle, the talks naturally could go nowhere. If the British 
side wanted to resume talks, they must withdraw the partial 
electoral bill. We cherish no illusions about the British side 
mending their way now, though we still have good faith in talks. 
<H5>  The British Side Has Lacked Sincerity From the Beginning </H5>
  During the 17 rounds of talks, we repeatedly reminded the 
British side of the principle. We tried in every possible way 
and made concessions to reach an agreement. In the latter 
stages, we suggested first discussing the 1994 electoral 
arrangements, which are simpler and more pressing, for district 
boards and the two municipal councils so that there would be 
more time to deal with Legco elections. They agreed to our 
proposal but advanced three preconditions: The first concerns 
the voting age, the second the voting method, and the third the 
abolishment of appointed seats. During the talks, we in fact 
made concessions on the three preconditions. We agreed on 
lowering the voting age to 18, which we also proposed long ago. 
We also agreed that the voting method be changed into a 
single-vote-single-seat system. We did not agree with the third 
precondition in principle because we must respect public 
opinion. After a total of 18 district boards had voiced their 
objection to the abolishment of appointed seats, it was the 
British side's business if they chose to abolish appointed seats 
in the 1994 elections, but we told them we will restore 
appointed seats after 1997. This problem was in fact solved 
later because the British side agreed with the Chinese side's 
approach, believing agreeing to disagree provided a good way 
out. But they raised new issues at this point by proposing that 
the single-vote-single-seat system apply in 1995. We did not 
say yes or no to this proposal but suggested that this problem 
should be discussed together with the 1995 elections. Our 
position was reasonable because this was a problem concerning 
the 1995 elections. Since they had agreed to first address the 
problems concerning the 1994 elections, the problem concerning 
the 1995 elections should be discussed later. But they insisted 
on solving the two problems together, saying it will waste time 
to discuss the voting methods for the 1994 and the 1995 
elections separately in Legco. We replied that this does not 
mean wasting time and that it matters little to spend a little 
more time if this will facilitate smooth transfer of government. 
Legco had wasted much more time on discussions! How should 
this be regarded as wasting time? For the British Hong Kong 
government, this was a problem of technicalities, but for the 
Chinese side this was a matter of principle. We did not agree 
with nor objected to the single-vote-single-seat system, but 
after the 1995 electoral bill was tabled in Legco and a Legco 
decision made, the bill could not be amended. We adhered to our 
principle and made our position clear on 17 April of last year. 
Finally the British side firmly rejected our position and 
decided to unilaterally present the partial electoral bill to 
Legco for examination and approval. All this shows that British 
side lacked sincerity from the beginning. Therefore we will have 
to organize three-tier councils in 1997 in accordance with the 
Basic Law. We have no other alternatives. We did not 
anticipate this. 
  While drafting the Basic Law, we decided to provide a 
through- train for legislators elected in 1995 so that they 
would be allowed to ride the train to the post-1997 
administration. Our overall design aimed at smooth transition, 
which was our wish. Unfortunately our wish will not come true 
due to noncooperation of the British side. Despite this, we 
will still firmly implement the Sino-British Joint Declaration 
and the Basic Law. We will make determined efforts to make 
smooth transfer possible so that Hong Kong will still be a 
prosperous and stable city after 1997. 
<H3>  Think About the Interests of Hong Kong People Administering 
Hong Kong </H3>
  Despite political problems, we will still help Hong Kong 
people effect a smooth transition. For Britain, Chris Patten 
must go home in three years and it does not matter whether he 
goes by plane, ship, or bicycle. However, Hong Kong people will 
remain in Hong Kong for several decades and several centuries. 
After several decades and several centuries, Hong Kong will 
remain China's special administrative region (SAR) and everyone 
should contribute to Hong Kong's long-term stability. In this 
sense we hope to develop economic cooperation with Britons. 
Specifically speaking, the airport issue is in fact a very 
simple issue. We held eight-month- long talks on the issue and 
our premier signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the 
airport. One, the Chinese Government formally expressed support 
for the building of a new airport; two, the new airport must be 
cost effective so as not to leave a heavy financial burden to 
the future SAR government; and three, specifically speaking, the 
Hong Kong British Government should leave the SAR government a 
financial reserve of HK$25 billion (Hong Kong dollars), which is 
not a big amount. This is not an excessive demand. I should 
like to tell you: We contended for the 25 billion bit by bit. 
At first, they promised to give HK$5 billion. We asked them 
how the Hong Kong people can get along with HK$5 billion. That 
was why I said that they only gave the change. I have made an 
unpleasant analogy: Like an old lady doing shopping in the 
vegetable market, they haggled about the price. They finally 
agreed to give HK$25 billion and said not a cent will be added. 
In our view, the HK$25 billion was absolutely not sufficient, 
but there would be a land fund in the future. We are taking 
care of the fund now and will give it back to Hong Kong people 
after 1997. According to the earlier estimation, the land fund 
would increase to over HK$70 billion by 1997. This amount plus 
the 25 billion would make 100 billion. Experience shows that 
the land fund alone will probably increase to HK$100 billion by 
1997. We must hold ourselves responsible to the SAR government 
and lay a sound financial foundation for it. In short, we hope 
Hong Kong people will have more money at their disposal when 
they are entrusted with the task of administering Hong Kong. 
<H5>  A Guarantee of HK$25 Billion Is Demanded </H5>
  The future Hong Kong Special Administration Region [SAR] 
will 
be independent financially. Honestly, the central government 
will not ask for a single dollar from Hong Kong. They do not 
need to turn over a cent, and our value-added tax does not 
concern them either. The central government will not levy taxes 
in Hong Kong. But if Hong Kong has a fiscal deficit and asks for 
financial help from the center, it will also be difficult, I am 
afraid, to get it. Many localities and departments do not 
understand why we will are not going to levy taxes in the Hong 
Kong SAR in the future. They feel we treat Hong Kong too well 
and ask why we should treat it so well. The center is doing 
something for Guangdong and Shanghai in the hope that they will 
make a greater contribution to the state. The state is currently 
having financial difficulties, but some places are better-off. 
Hong Kong is, of course, much better-off. Nevertheless, our 
policy is that we will not ask for a single dollar from Hong 
Kong. Therefore, we now have to explain to every province and 
department why we cannot levy taxes in Hong Kong and why we need 
to maintain Hong Kong's financial independence. We should not 
view Hong Kong from the perspective of a little tax, but from a 
broad perspective and from Hong Kong's overall contribution. 
  In order for Hong Kong to have a comparatively good 
financial 
foundation in the future, we demanded that the British Hong Kong 
Government offer a guarantee of HK$25 billion. Later, after the 
Memorandum of Understanding was signed, Financial Secretary 
Hamish Macleod said that the financial reserves by 1997 were 
estimated to stand at HK$78 billion. As we heard this, we asked 
him: "You said on the conference table that it was difficult to 
retain HK$25 billion, how then will the reserves come to HK$78 
billion? It is just as well to retain the HK$78 billion." But 
he said no, claiming that the HK$78 billion was only an 
estimated figure and was unreliable. I said: "As financial 
secretary, you have to be responsible for whatever you say. It 
shows you are being irresponsible if you say something when you 
are not so sure of it. Although you said there would be HK$78 
billion, for our part, we do not demand that you retain all the 
HK$78 billion for the SAR government. In any case, we only 
demand that HK$25 billion be retained strictly in accordance 
with the Basic Law. That was the first specific question. 
<H5>  The Debt To Be Left to the SAR Government Must Not Be Added </H5>
  The second specific question was about the debt to be left 
to 
the SAR government. It is provided that the debt to be left to 
the SAR government must not exceed HK$5 billion. If the debt 
exceeds this amount, they must negotiate with us because they 
will only leave a total of HK$25 billion to the SAR government. 
If the debt increases, then the SAR government will be 
penniless. Therefore, the principle is very simple, that is, 
leaving no financial burden to the SAR government in keeping 
with the basic principle of cost- effectiveness. We thought 
that the matter was already settled when the Memorandum of 
Understanding was signed and that the airport could be 
constructed in accordance with the memorandum. If the British 
Hong Kong Government needs to borrow money, it can do so as long 
as the borrowings do not exceed HK$5 billion and as long as they 
notify us of the borrowings. The question has already been 
settled, but why are they now saying that they need to negotiate 
with us? This only serves to complicate the matter. Now the 
amount of debt they have agreed to will greatly exceed HK$5 
billion. It will even be greater than the financial reserves to 
be left to the SAR government. Although the debt does not 
necessarily remain unsettled by that time and, in fact, it will 
probably have been repaid by that time, if any problems crop up 
there is the possibility of insolvency. 
  Some projects in particular are loss-making deals. They 
entail high costs and bring low returns, not the other way 
round. As far as the airport railway is concerned, judging from 
the data they have given us, we see that until the year 2036, 
the annual profit rate only stands at 2 percent. Now they will 
put the railway under the management of the Mass Transit Railway 
Company [MTR]. Moreover, the data they have given us says the 
MTR also maintains that it is impossible to run the railway with 
a profit rate of 2 percent and that the profit rate must reach 
at least 10 percent. It is obviously a loss-making deal. If 
this question is improperly settled, it can be a very big burden 
on the future SAR government. The British Hong Kong Government 
is demolishing the eastern wall in order to build the western 
wall, that is, it is subsidizing the losses on the airport 
railway with the MTR's surpluses. For this reason the MTR has 
requested not to distribute dividends after 1997 which should 
otherwise be distributed. Moreover, the MTR also needs 
development and needs to construct new routes in the future. If 
it uses up the surpluses now, how can it construct new routes in 
the future? If so, it will inevitably ask for money from the 
SAR government. But where will it find the money then? 
Therefore, I say it is possible that the debt cannot be cleared 
in the future. We can see from this that they have no sincerity 
with regard to cooperation with the Chinese side and with Hong 
Kong people. 
  They simply lack sincerity for cooperation with Hong Kong 
people and simply do not consider the interests of Hong Kong 
people. We also know that many contracts have already been won 
by British companies. Some are even on very unreasonable terms. 
There is no fair treatment for some public tenders. After all, 
we cannot use up the money that is to be left to the SAR 
government in 1997. We say that they cannot use all the money on 
constructing an airport because we need a very substantial 
amount for contingency uses. Honestly speaking, affected by the 
price factor, the current HK$100 billion or more of reserves 
will surely be worth far less three years from now. Therefore, 
considering the interests of Hong Kong people, we cannot make 
any further concessions on this question. 
<H5>  The British Side Does Not Separate Politics From Economics </H5>
  The reason why I say this here today is simple. I hope the 
British side will return to the Memorandum of Understanding and 
construct a new airport as soon as possible in accordance with 
the memorandum. 
  The British side keeps on saying that they have separated 
economics from politics. In fact, it is precisely the British 
side that has mixed economics and politics. Their words are 
high- sounding, but in fact they have lumped them together. It 
is not only on political matters but also on economic matters 
that they do not cooperate with us and Hong Kong people. To put 
it in irritating terms, they consider their own interests or 
proceed in everything from their own interests. Therefore, we 
regret the British attitude very much. 
  Out of good intentions and in order to promote the soonest- 
possible settlement of the airport issue, our Preliminary Work 
Committee discussed some regulations regarding the airport 
management organization. I have read several times the data 
given by the British Hong Kong Government. There are many 
things there that I really do not understand. I had hoped the 
British side would send a person to give an explanation of some 
of the questions to the Preliminary Work Committee. The 
Preliminary Work Committee is our advisory body, and we need to 
solicit their views so that they help us in the talks with the 
British Hong Kong authorities on the airport issue. But, as you 
have also seen, they simply will not come. We did not intend to 
put them in a difficult position, and we did not specifically 
invite Gordon Siu Kwing-chue to give an explanation in Beijing. 
Earlier on, he had decided to attend a ceremony in Beijing on 
the 26th of this month for the signing of an agreement on 
cooperation in training between the Civil Aviation 
Administration of China and the Civil Aviation Department of 
Hong Kong. Precisely because of his coming, our Economic Group 
decided to hold a meeting on the 26th so that he could give an 
explanation to the Preliminary Work Committee. When we made 
this request, the British Hong Kong Government not only totally 
rejected it but also canceled Siu Kwing-chue's Beijing trip. 
What attitude was this? Was this the separation of politics and 
economics? Although we have failed to reach agreement on 
political matters, we should cooperate well on constructing an 
airport, which is an economic matter. But they are not willing 
to cooperate anyhow and we regret this very much. 
  Finally, Lu Ping said: After all, Hong Kong is the Hong Kong 
of Hong Kong people. We are only helping them. The concerted 
efforts of everyone are still needed in the future.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Huang Nien-si (7806 1819 2448): "Ma </F>
Yuzhen, Chinese Ambassador to Britain on Sino-British Trade"] 
  [Text] London 21 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--Ma Yuzhen, Chinese 
ambassador to Britain said here today that Chinese residing in 
Britain do not have to worry about their right of abode in Hong 
Kong in the future; the Chinese government would certainly 
appropriately find a solution to that issue. 
  While dealing with the right of permanent abode in Hong 
Kong, 
an issue of concern for Chinese residing in Britain and 
Sino-British trade in an interview with reporters here today, Ma 
Yuzhen said that on the right of abode in Hong Kong of those 
Chinese who have already acquired foreign passports and Chinese 
living overseas as well in the second generation, the Chinese 
authorities were studying the question according to the Basic 
Law; it was believed that the matter would certainly be 
appropriately resolved in due time; Chinese friends had no need 
to worry about it. 
  Earlier, some individual responsible person of a Chinese 
organization aired his view involving the right of abode in Hong 
Kong in the future of former Hong Kong residents now residing in 
Britain, and was ready to reflect their anxieties to the Chinese 
Embassy in Britain. Regarding this, Ma Yuzhen said: "Chinese 
compatriots and friends are welcomed to actively relay their 
opinions to the Chinese Embassy; the matter is now under the 
study of the Chinese Government. Our compatriots may rest at 
ease; at the same time, we hope that our compatriots will guard 
against some people sowing discord at this moment." 
  Ma Yuzhen explained: "On the Hong Kong issue, the British 
Government has pursued a plan for Hong Kong residents' right of 
abode in Britain, which the Chinese Government is against; 
however, the Chinese Government will not oppose or target those 
people who have already acquired the right of abode in Britain; 
furthermore, convenience will be allowed people in this category 
regarding their right of abode in Hong Kong; as to specific 
conditions, they are under study at present." 
  He also talked about the contributions Chinese residing in 
Britain make to the British economy and Sino-British trade and 
the understanding of the anxieties of Chinese capital in Britain 
over the effects of the Hong Kong issue on Sino-British trade. 
  While reiterating the Chinese Government's view on the 
issue, 
Ma Yuzhen said that because Britain had adopted a 
non-cooperative attitude, effects on other arenas in 
Sino-British relations would be inevitable. "Although 
subjectively, we do not wish to see such circumstances, there is 
nothing we could do about it. The responsibility does not rest 
with us; objective conditions and subjective wishes are two 
different kettles of fish." Ma Yuzhen said the above was what 
he told some British friends of the business circles of the 
British Industrial Association. 
  He criticized Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's attitude 
toward Sino-British trade relations in his appearance at the 
hearing of the British Foreign Affairs group yesterday; it was 
unwise for Patten to have deliberately linked it to the issue of 
China applying for restoral of GATT membership. 
  At the hearing yesterday, Chris Patten said that he did not 
believe that China would resist Sino-British trade because of 
the Hong Kong issue on the grounds that China was applying for 
the restoration of its GATT membership. "Restoring China's 
position in GATT will be helpful to China as well as the whole 
international community; should an attitude of obstruction be 
adopted, that would be unwise, nor would it be helpful to 
Britain," Ma Yuzhen concluded.

"Who Is Harming Hong Kong's Freedom of the Press?"] 
  [Text] Governor Chris Patten made a speech on a public 
occasion the day before yesterday and talked a lot about 
so-called freedom of the press. He urged Hong Kong's media not 
to exercise "self-censorship," to bravely stand up and "strive 
to uphold a free press after 1997," and not to allow Hong Kong's 
freedom of the press and "the regional oasis to be infringed 
upon." To people in journalism circles, there is nothing new 
about this provocative speech, because recently Chris Patten and 
high-ranking officials of the Hong Kong Government have 
redoubled their "concern" for the media of Hong Kong and have 
constantly repeated such views together with some strange inside 
stories. Journalism circles have heard them for some time. 
<H3>  Exerting Pressure on the Media With the Theory of 
"Self-Examination" </H3>
  Although Chris Patten did not begin his life as a 
journalist, 
he seems to have a special liking for journalism. Evidently, 
the idea of "self-censorship" has come from his so-called 
"observation" of the media. During recent meetings with guests 
and in interviews, Chris Patten has often elaborated on his own 
initiative on the idea of "self-censorship." He holds that all 
media in Hong Kong have knelt before Beijing, and, therefore, 
the Hong Kong Government should deliver the media from its 
extreme misery and would "tramp over hill and dale" to defend 
the freedom of the press. In an interview by a reporter from a 
certain Hong Kong newspaper on 4 January, Chris Patten said that 
the Hong Kong Government "will not abuse the existing 
regulations and laws to hamper freedom of speech or freedom of 
the press," but will "study laws which may be abused and revise 
them." He implied that existing laws will be further relaxed. 
Chris Patten said encouragingly: "If the Journalists 
Association and other organizations make proposals, I am willing 
to take an active part in the debate." 
  With the governor leading the way, high-ranking officials 
have followed closely. A column disclosed that, by order of the 
governor, newly appointed Chief Secretary Anson Chan selectively 
feted people in charge of some newspapers at the beginning of 
this month. At the banquet, Mrs. Chan asked the chief editors 
if they felt any pressure from the Chinese side. "Is 
self-censorship very serious?" This implied that 
"self-examination" was the reason why chief editors did not 
support Chris Patten's proposals on constitutional reform. 
Unexpectedly, such "instructive remarks" caused resentment 
among the chief editors. They held that newspapers regarded 
serving their readers as their purpose and that there was no 
such thing as "self-examination." The column said that the 
chief editors expressed their resentment to her and greatly 
embarrassed her. 
  Chris Patten has always thought nothing of the Chinese 
newspapers in Hong Kong. Moreover, most Chinese newspapers in 
Hong Kong take a critical attitude toward Chris Patten on the 
constitutional issue. This has increased the governor's aversion 
to the Hong Kong media. Whenever there is any important 
information, Chris Patten is more willing to provide it to the 
media of his own country. The chief secretary meant to help the 
governor "pay attention to the so-called issue of 
`self-censorship.'" It turned out that the conversation was 
disagreeable and ended in embarrassment. 
  It is really difficult to explain why Chris Patten and high- 
ranking officials in the Hong Kong Government have shown their 
"concern" for freedom of the press in Hong Kong so frequently. 
It is as if the media were being seriously repressed and they 
were the only people who could relieve the media of their 
sufferings. This kind of unaccountable "attention" has caused 
uneasiness even among the media, which has seldom taken a 
critical attitude toward the British Hong Kong Government. 
According to a commentary carried by a Hong Kong newspaper, 
Chris Patten "often tells the British press that everyone in 
journalism circles in Hong Kong exercises self- discipline, and 
all the media have carried out self-examination and have 
automatically knelt down to Beijing." If one reads British 
newspapers, one can often come across this kind of article. 
After reading such articles, readers who have no idea about the 
situation may believe that journalists in Hong Kong keep their 
mouths shut and are out of the game. Such an image does great 
harm to journalism in Hong Kong. 
  This side stubbornly wants the media to admit to exercising 
"self-censorship" and the other side has already taken 
corresponding action. This is good coordination indeed. 
Recently, the so-called "Publishers Association," whose 
membership mainly consists of foreigners and which does not have 
much influence on journalism circles, issued a "Code of Conduct 
for Publishers" to some media organizations and asked them to 
jointly sign the code. It is said that one of the main contents 
of the code is to set up a "Publishers' Code of Conduct 
Committee," similar to the "press council," which would be in 
charge of criticizing, guiding, and assessing the contents of 
publications in Hong Kong. Keen observers have pointed out 
that, outwardly, the committee does not have the legal right of 
censorship, but in reality, the influence of public opinion on 
journalism circles is used to exert pressure. It is known 
through hearsay that a certain female member of the Legislative 
Council is promoting this work from behind the scenes. I 
remember that someone made a proposal to establish a press 
council in the past, but his proposal met with strong opposition 
among the majority of journalists. At present, the abnormal 
move by this organization, which is against the will of the 
majority of journalists, is echoing the governor's 
"self-censorship" theory in such a way that it has raised 
doubts. This is clearly a measure to restrict the press. Why 
should the label of "defending the freedom of the press" be 
stuck to it! 
  According to reports, this move has been positively 
responded 
to by an "enthusiastic" media organization which is favored by 
the governor. Recently, the organization published a quarterly, 
which regularly comments on various newspapers. Its contents 
included "a search for some contributed articles which have been 
modified, examined, or rejected, and the disclosure of inside 
stories behind this `information.'" The modification, 
examination, acceptance, and rejection of contributed articles 
are entirely normal procedures in the internal operations of 
press organs and are the normal duties of journalists at 
different levels. If people have to worry that even such 
operations and performance of their duties will be scrutinized, 
disclosed, and castigated in "black and white," what freedom of 
the press can people talk about! 
  At the same time, the British Hong Kong Government has also 
made full use of the electronic media and has professed on many 
occasions that it will revise the relevant restrictions on 
foreign corporations's purchase of Hong Kong media and will 
issue more satellite television licenses to western media in 
order to build Hong Kong into the so-called "satellite 
broadcasting center of Asia" and further internationalize the 
media in Hong Kong. 
<H5>  The Aim Is To Sow Discord and Split the People of Hong Kong </H5>
  We all know that Hong Kong is a pluralistic commercial 
society and that market orientation is, after all, an important 
factor for the media to consider. The media has the right to 
select what should or should not be published or broadcast. 
This should be part of the freedom of the press. What is 
difficult to understand is that the British Hong Kong 
authorities, which repeatedly talk about the freedom of the 
press, do not match their words with their deeds, thinking one 
way and behaving in another. Some changes in stock ownership 
took place in an English-language newspaper in Hong Kong, which 
in the past was regarded as the mouthpiece of the British Hong 
Kong Government. Chris Patten paid great attention to this 
change! This is a distortion of the freedom of the press rather 
than defending the freedom of the press! 
  Another example is that, last year, a reporter from a Hong 
Kong radio station was discriminated against by Mike Hanson, the 
Hong Kong governor's information coordinator, during an 
interview in the United States. The reporter argued strongly on 
just grounds. Mike Hanson went so far as to say threateningly 
that if the reporter did not behave properly, he would not be 
accredited by the Hong Kong Government in future news coverage. 
The radio station lodged a complaint with the governor and the 
matter ended up with nothing definite. Do people not often see 
incidents of wanton attacks and accusations, including by Chris 
Patten, or threats and lures with promises of gain, toward media 
which dare to take a critical attitude on Chris Patten? Is it 
not ridiculous for people who treat the media in this way to 
talk about defending freedom of the press! 
  Besides, resorting to the method of stealthily substituting 
one thing for another and doing scissors-and-paste work, the 
British BBC edited and broadcast "Mao Zedong, the Last Emperor," 
which slandered Mao Zedong. Such a trick did not conform to 
journalistic ethics and seriously hurt the feelings of the 
Chinese people. It was only right for the Chinese Government to 
lodge a protest. Television stations in Hong Kong did not 
broadcast the film. It can be said that they made a wise 
decision. However, Chris Patten, some members of the 
Legislative Council, and a few so-called personalities of the 
democratic movement who oppose the Chinese Government were 
greatly disappointed. They openly or secretly exerted pressure 
on the television stations. Chris Patten even publicly incited 
people and said he was waiting to see "whether or not it will be 
broadcast." In this way, he exerted pressure on the media. Some 
people even wanted to hold demonstrations because of this. Does 
it mean that Hong Kong has no freedom of the press if a 
television program made in a despicable way is not shown? On 
the other hand, only a small proportion of the dirty scandals 
made public by the media in foreign countries about the British 
royal family and cabinet members, who behave like thieves and 
whores, are published or broadcast by the media in Hong Kong. 
Has Hong Kong not lost all of its freedom of the press 
according to their logic? Why is it necessary for Chris Patten 
to "defend" it at all today! 
  The British Hong Kong authorities, which regard themselves 
as 
the apologists of freedom, have also linked freedom of the press 
with 1997, implying that there will not be freedom of the press 
in Hong Kong after 1997. Such incitation is even more 
ridiculous. Ensuring freedom of speech and freedom of the press 
in Hong Kong is an important factor for Hong Kong in practicing 
one country, two systems after 1997. This is clearly stated in 
Article 27 of the Basic Law. How come Chris Patten, who claims 
to have read the Basic Law more often than the Bible, is 
ignorant of this? 
  British colonial rule has always included stringent controls 
over the media. If one reads modern history about British 
colonies, one will find that it is full of the despicable 
records of notorious Britain. When were people under colonial 
rule given true "freedom of the press?" At present, Chris 
Patten has changed his normal behavior and has started showing 
"concern" for the freedom of the press. However, such 
performances has caused aversion and resentment among people of 
insight in journalism circles. They are worried that amid cries 
of "the wolves are coming," freedom of the press in Hong Kong is 
being infringed upon and trampled on by thieves crying "stop 
thief." Talking about "self-censorship," trying to "making 
comments on" the press, or relaxing relevant policies are 
nothing but attempts to coerce with the remnant powers of the 
colonial rule to continue and strengthen controls over the 
media. On the other hand, they are attempts to sow discords, to 
bring about splits and confrontations among the people of Hong 
Kong, to sow discord between the media and the Chinese side, and 
to fan feelings of confrontation. The prerequisite of all this 
is to shake and damage the objective and neutral position of the 
media. It is not difficult to see clearly whether Chris Patten 
is defending or damaging freedom of the press in Hong Kong.

  [Text] China has complained to the Hong Kong Government 
about the screening in the territory of the controversial BBC 
documentary on Mao Zedong. Although Chinese officials at first 
kept silent about the showing of the film by pro-democracy 
activist Lau Shan- ching at a public meeting, it is understood 
the local branch of XINHUA (the New China News Agency) recently 
lodged a formal complaint with the Government. 
  Mr Lau was last week given permission by the Television and 
Entertainment Licensing Authority (TELA) to show the film as 
often as he wished. The authority said it had no reason to 
refuse Mr Lau's request because other distributors had had 
similar requests granted under normal circumstances. TELA is 
allowed to ban any film which is likely to damage friendly 
relations with other countries. 
  News of China's objection came as the Foreign 
Correspondents' 
Club (FCC) screened the Mao documentary yesterday. Xinhua 
officials last week asked the FCC not to show the film, Chairman 
Mao: The Last Emperor. They said it had "hurt the feelings of 
the Chinese people". But as the showing got under way, club 
president Philip Bowring said: "There's not a great deal they 
can do." 
  The crowded screening at the club's headquarters in Central 
also drew interest from the Urban Council and TELA, though 
neither had shown any interest in other films shown at the FCC 
in recent years, club vice-president Carl Goldstein said. TELA 
had asked the FCC to submit the film script for censorship, Mr 
Goldstein said. The club had replied to TELA by post. 
  Private clubs must obtain TELA approval for screenings, but 
FCC board members said they could not remember TELA concerning 
itself with previous screenings at the club. A government 
spokesman said TELA approached the FCC after newspaper reporters 
asked whether it had obtained approval. Urban Council 
inspectors visited the club yesterday to ensure it would not 
admit the general public to the screening, Mr Goldstein said. 
  TVB last year bought the rights to show the Mao film but has 
so far declined to screen it. Mr Lau, jailed in China for 10 
years for "counterrevolutionary" crimes, has shown the film 
twice. He has said he will keep screening it until TVB agrees 
to do so. The activist is to meet TVB representatives this week 
to seek an explanation as to why it had exercised "censorship".

  [Text] An air and sea search is continuing for nine crew

and broke in two in the South China Sea last night. Twenty-five 
other crewmen were rescued, but one was later certified dead. 
  Senior Marine Officer Philip Weaver explained what happened: 
  [Begin Weaver recording] Late last night, the Cosmos S 
actually had an explosion according to the people on board, and 
the ship subsequently broke in two, the fore part caught fire, 
and the vessel was abandoned. Shortly thereafter, some other 
ships came by and rescued 24 survivors and recovered one dead 
body. Throughout the night, the search continued for the 
missing nine people. Then in the morning we had a fixed-wing 
aircraft on scene, during the night and again in the morning. 
That has returned to Kai Tak [Hong Kong's airport]. We are 
having one more search this afternoon. The weather on scene is 
easterly gale force. The captain of the on- scene commander has 
said that he thinks there is little chance of any survivors. 
The nine survivors that were thought to be alive may have 
perished in the initial disembarkation because some eyewitnesses 
have reported that the life raft was seen to be consumed by 
flame. [end recording]

2494): "Macao Embarks on Stable Development of the Late 
Transitional Period"] 
  [Text] Macao, 22 Dec (XINHUA) -- The first year in which 
Macao enters the late transitional period was 1993. Due to the 
friendly cooperation between China and Portugal, Macao has 
enjoyed social stability, work in all areas has continued to 
develop, and new progress has been made in the work of the 
transitional period. 
  With the extensive participation and active support by 
people 
of all circles of Macao, drafting of the Macao Special 
Administrative Zone's Basic Law has been completed as scheduled, 
and the law was formally promulgated after it was examined and 
approved in March by the First Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress. The Basic Law establishes the principle and 
policy of "one country, two systems" in the form of law, 
providing an accurate and clear picture of Macao's future 
development and providing a fundamental assurance for Macao's 
stable transition and its long-term stable development; the 
Basic Law has been welcomed by people of all strata of Macao. 
Currently, the Macao Basic Law Promotion Society -- a civic 
organization formed by the former Macao Basic Law Drafting 
Committee and the former Macao Basic Law Counselling Committee 
-- is working actively to further publicize and promote the 
basic law in an effort to further deepen Macao residents' 
understanding of the Basic Law and to enable work of the 
transitional period to be in line with the Basic Law. 
  In the late transitional period, the Sino-Portuguese Joint 
Liaison Group's work and tasks have become heavier. In the 
spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, the two 
sides have strengthened communications, enhanced mutual 
understanding, and strived to quicken the pace of work. Since 
the beginning of this year, the Joint Liaison Group, in addition 
to continuing consultations on the three major issues of the 
transitional period and the issue of Macao's participation in 
international organizations, has separately formed a work group 
on currency issues, a work group on aviation agreements, and a 
work group on government employees' pensions, to study and 
discuss the respective issues. Through friendly consultations, 
the two sides also have reached an agreement on issues 
concerning the Macao International Airport, signed documents on 
air transportation agreement, and begun to examine Macao's first 
aviation agreement with other localities, thereby ensuring the 
smooth proceeding of the construction of the Macao International 
Airport and of other airport-related work. However, relatively 
slow progress has been made in establishing the Chinese 
language's official status and in making government employees 
and Macao law more locally-oriented. However, the slight 
progress in the work in these areas attained so far has laid a 
foundation for quickening the pace of resolving these issues. 
  Economically, Macao has always benefited from the mainland's 
reform and opening up. Promotion of the socialist market 
economy on the mainland has provided Macao with new 
opportunities and development space. Macao has enjoyed social 
stability and its industrial and commercial development has been 
steady. From 1987 to 1992, Macao's total output value increased 
42 percent -- resulting in an average annual growth rate of 7 
percent -- and the government's financial revenues increased 337 
percent. Since the beginning of this year, affected by the 
economic recessions in Europe and the United States, Macao's 
total export value in the first 8 months decreased 2.1 percent 
from the same period of last year, and its imports increased 1.7 
percent. However, Macao's tourist industry, financial industry, 
commercial activities, and other tertiary industries have 
performed very well. A total of 5.32 million tourists visited 
Macao in the first eight months of this year, an increase of 3.8 
percent from the same period last year. As of the end of June, 
savings deposits by all Macao residents (excluding off- coast 
deposits) totaled 52.39 billion and local loans totaled 31.56 
billion Macao dollars, up 5.1 and 21.9 percent, respectively, 
over the same period last year. Commercial investments have 
been brisk, with the number of companies inaugurated in the 
first six months and registered capital showing a fairly big 
increase over last year's corresponding period. 
  Meanwhile, considerable progress has been made in improving 
infrastructure, and construction of a number of large 
engineering projects has proceeded smoothly. Of these projects, 
the new Hong Kong-Macao Passengers Pier, the Jiulong-Macao 
Deep-Water Harbor, a garbage incendiary, and the Songshan Tunnel 
have been completed and put into operation; the new Macao-Taipa 
bridge will be completed and opened to traffic early next year; 
and the construction of an international airport has proceeded 
smoothly, with two thirds of the artificial islands in the 
runway area being completed. Recently Macao and Guangdong have 
reached an agreement on extension of the Guangzhou-Zhuhai 
Railway and Expressway to Macao. The completion of these 
infrastructural facilities will make Macao more accessible to 
the outside world and will promote its economic growth. 
  With the year 1999 drawing near, Macao has increased its 
contacts with the hinterland and witnessed record two-way 
investments as well as economic and trade activities; the 
footsteps of Macao businessmen have extended from the Zhujiang 
Delta to the central, eastern, and northeastern China. Exchange 
and cooperation in the areas of economics, science and 
technology, media, culture, education, sports, and health have 
brought about better understanding and greater trust, thus 
enhancing the confidence of people in various circles in Macao's 
future development. 
  Authoritative sources here pointed out: Since the beginning 
of the transitional period, Macao has been able to effect smooth 
transition and promote social stability and prosperity primarily 
because China and Portugal have carried out friendly cooperation 
based on the Joint Statement to solve many problems facing the 
transition through consultations; it is also because of the 
active participation and concerted effort of the people in 
various circles in Macao. So long as the two sides continue to 
work concertedly in line with the spirit of the Sino-Portuguese 
Joint Statement, Macao will surely be able to smoothly carry out 
the work of various fields during the transition and create a 
favorable environment for the smooth handover of political power 
in the year 1999.

  [Text] Macao, January 23 (XINHUA) -- A drive aiming to 
popularize the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative 
Region (SAR) among local residents was launched here today. 
  Sponsored by the Association for Promoting the Basic Law of 
Macao SAR, today's activity includes an exhibition which through 
pictures and short articles introduced the content and 
significance of the Macao Basic Law to local residents and 
visitors. 
  An organizer of the activity said the Basic Law, a 
constitutional document of the future Macao SAR, is closely 
linked with the interest of local people. It is an urgent task 
in the remaining years of the transitional period to introduce 
the Basic Law to local residents, especially youths and children. 
  He said that more activities of this kind will be held this

<F P=106> [By special correspondents Chang Sheng-tai (1728 5110 1486) </F>
and Kuo Hung-Chin (6753 1347 3112): "In Seeking Reunification, 
Mainland China Has Even Considered Changing National Name"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Jan (LIEN HO PAO)--An official who has 
participated in the CPC's policymaking on Taiwan affairs has 
disclosed that the CPC has indeed considered changing its 
national name for the sake of reunification if this is necessary. 
  This person who is chiefly consulted on Taiwan affairs by 
the 
CPC said: The "one country, two systems" pattern advanced by 
Deng Xiaoping has always been the CPC's basic principle for 
reunifying Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. However, regarding the 
substantial contents of "one country, two systems," there is a 
lot of room for discussion. Such questions as how the 
government is to be composed and what the future national name 
will be can be settled when the two sides of the Taiwan Strait 
come together and talk. He cited Mao Zedong's joke that, 
throughout his life, Mao Zedong was most unhappy about changing 
the national name from the Republic of China to the PRC. This 
person pointed out: The point the CPC sticks to is 
"reunification." It also agrees to Taiwan's demand of "being 
master of its own affairs." The only thing that cannot be 
changed is that Taiwan cannot have independence or pursue the 
existence of two separate countries. 
  This important policymaker pointed out: The CPC has indeed 
studied specific questions regarding one country, two systems 
including the question of a national name. But before the two 
sides hold face-to-face talks, the CPC will never show its "one 
country, two systems" hand, regarding the national name and form 
of government, because the CPC maintains that once they have 
shown their hand, the Taiwan authorities will not want to talk. 
Therefore, although the CPC has some ideas about the "one 
country, two systems," it will not publicize the specific 
contents. 
  Concerning whether or not the CPC-proposed "one country, two 
systems" principle will change in the future, this person did 
not think that was possible. He said that "one country, two 
systems" is already the CPC's bottom line for its reunification 
policy and that any further concessions are out of the question.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA reporters Wan Hongqiang (8001 4767 </F>
1730) and Zhu Zhide (2612 3112 1795): "The Characteristics and 
Trend of Taiwan Compatriots' Investment on the Mainland in 1993"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 6 Jan (XINHUA) -- The fervor of Taiwan 
compatriots for investing in the mainland continued in 1993. 
Compared with the previous years, investment on the mainland in 
1993 by Taiwan businessmen extended to more localities, and the 
sectors and scale of investment further expanded -- long-term 
investment began to increase and Taiwan's large consortiums and 
enterprises speeded up studies of the mainland's investment 
climate and quickened the pace of their investment. According 
to statistics provided by concerned departments, as of October 
1993, the mainland had approved the establishment of more than 
15,100 Taiwan-funded enterprises, with a total investment figure 
of more than $13.6 billion. Many people of insight in Taiwan's 
business circles point out that economic cooperation between the 
mainland and Taiwan has become an extremely important factor in 
Taiwan's further economic development. 
  Taiwan business investment on the mainland in 1993 had the 
following distinct characteristics: 
  1. The areas in which investment is being made continued to 
grow quickly, spreading from the southeast coastal area to the 
entire coastal area as well as to some inland provinces. 
Taiwan-invested enterprises in the areas along the Chang Jiang, 
along the coastal area of the Bo Hai, and in inland provinces 
increased noticeably, and they also began to appear in such 
remote areas as Qinghai and Tibet. According to statistics 
compiled by the foreign economic relations and trade commissions 
of the four cities along the coastal area of the Bo Hai -- 
Tianjin, Dalian, Qinhuangdao, and Qingdao -- in January and 
February last year, the four cities approved a total of more 
than 700 Taiwan investment projects, with a total investment 
figure of more than $600 million. In areas along the Chang 
Jiang, Shanghai approved 482 direct Taiwan investment projects 
during the January-September period worth a total of $430 
million, exceeding the total number of Taiwan investment 
projects and the total investment figure for the preceding 5 
years combined. Both the number of Taiwan investment projects 
and volume of investment approved by Anhui in 1993 increased 
several fold over the year before. Jiangsu is now the province 
with the largest number of Taiwan-invested enterprises. Taiwan 
investments in Sichuan, Jiangxi, and other inland provinces also 
increased by a large margin compared with previous years. 
Northeast China has begun to become a hot spot for Taiwan 
investment -- Liaoning Province alone approved the establishment 
of more than 300 Taiwan-funded enterprises during the 
January-September period, more than the combined total of the 
previous 9 years. 
  2. Taiwan investment was spread over a greater area and 
long-term investment increased. In addition to the 
labor-intensive processing industries, which were the major 
target of Taiwan industrial business investment on the mainland 
in the early years, investment has now begun to shift to capital 
and technology-intensive modern industries; to the 
transportation, energy, and communications industries; and to 
other infrastructural facilities. Taiwan businessmen established 
on the mainland some new and high- technology enterprises such 
as plasma cutting machine manufacturing, laser products, silicon 
rubber, printed circuit boards, and a few bioengineering 
ventures. Also, foreseeing a prosperous market on the mainland, 
Taiwan's home electrical appliance and computer industry began 
to invest in many areas of the mainland. And, Taiwan investment 
also began to enter the financial, real estate, and other 
sectors on the mainland. Last year, Taiwan's financial 
institutions began to open offices in Shenzhen and other 
localities. The B-type shares issued by the Xiamen Shankun 
Industrial Company, a company solely owned by Taiwan 
compatriots, were listed at the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 
mid-1993, making the company the first listed Taiwan enterprise 
on the mainland. Also, over the last few years, Taiwan 
investment on the mainland has focused on the purchase of 
factories and the right to use land as well as on building 
factories and dormitories; quite a few Taiwan investors have 
chosen to settle on the mainland and therefore have taken the 
initiative in planning long-term enterprise development 
strategies. 
  3. The scale of Taiwan investment reached a new level. The 
structure of Taiwan industrial investment on the mainland has 
also changed. Various surveys show that Taiwan investment on 
the mainland has not only has entered capital-intensive and 
high-technology industries and other long-term investment 
projects, but has also been injected into large, complex 
investment projects involving various industrial sectors -- 
Taiwan investment on the mainland has begun to be diversified. 
According to statistics released by Taiwan's "Council for 
Economic Planning and Development," 64 percent of Taiwan's 
manufacturing industrial enterprises have invested in the 
mainland; the volume of their investment on the mainland totaled 
$2.65 billion in the first 8 months of 1993, 14 times the figure 
for the same period in 1992. In Shenzhen, where the density of 
Taiwan investment is the highest, Taiwan investment has begun to 
shift to large and medium enterprises, with petrochemical and 
rubber industries leading the way. Taiwan's Tongyi Group and 
Weiquan Group, which are the leaders in Taiwan's food industry, 
have established solely-owned or co- invested food enterprises 
in various provinces and municipalities. Some of Taiwan's large 
enterprises have changed the "hit and run" experimental 
investment strategy they practiced at first and have begun 
long-term planning aimed at long-term development on the 
mainland. On the other hand, Taiwan investment in similar 
industries have become relatively concentrated in some 
localities, with the establishment of Taiwan industrial zones 
and processing zones. For example, Taiwan's Juda Bicycle 
Company and its satellite companies established a "bicycle 
production special zone" in Jiangsu's Kunshan city; the Taiwan 
Toy Association developed a "toy industrial city" in Zhejiang's 
Yuyao county; the Taipei City Computer Association established a 
"computer street" in Shanghai; and the Taiwan Machine-Building 
Association has plans to establish the "Taiwan Machine-Building 
Special Zone" in Zhejiang's Xiaoshan county. From these 
developments, Taiwan's economic sector has drawn this 
conclusion: Taiwan investment on the mainland has begun to 
increase in scale and has become more group-based. 
  A survey conducted by Taiwan's China Economic Research 
Institute shows that every U.S. dollar of Taiwan investment on 
the mainland will create $2 in output value for Taiwan's economy 
and that Taiwan investment on the mainland has become one of the 
major driving forces of Taiwan's economic development. An 
official of a well-known Taiwan consortium said frankly: "The 
mainland has abundant resources and the markets there are 
becoming increasingly attractive. Therefore, whether we are 
seeking development or trying to expand domestic and overseas 
markets, investing in the mainland has all the advantages." For 
this reason, people in both the mainland and Taiwan business 
circles expect that, as economic and trade exchanges across the 
strait increase, and as mutually- complementary and 
mutually-beneficial, cross-strait economic relations are being 
gradually established, Taiwan investment on the mainland will 
reach new heights, and that this will push cross-strait economic 
cooperation to a new stage.

"The Legal Adviser of the Association of Taiwan Businessmen in 
Wuhan Was Beaten, and the Hubei Provincial Governor Has Ordered 
Police Authorities To Investigate the Case As Early As Possible"] 
  [Text] Wuhan, 19 Jan (WEN WEI PO) -- Zhang Tao, legal 
adviser of the Association of Taiwan Businessmen, was beaten at 
the office of Hansheng Computer Company, a Taiwan-invested 
enterprise where he works as a local employee, on 7 January. 
This event has attracted attention and aroused anxiety from 
some Taiwan businessmen in Wuhan. This reporter went to gather 
news on the event a few days ago. 
  Some time after 1400 on 7 January, six unidentified young 
people rushed into Hansheng Computer Company, a Taiwan-invested 
enterprise in Wuchang District, carrying a spanner, saw, and 
other lethal weapons, and claiming that they had something to 
discuss with Zhang Tao. Having identified the individual as 
Zhang Tao, one of the gang said to him: "You assailed my wife 
with obscenities, so I have come to give you a lesson today." 
The gang then struck Zhang until his nose was broken and 
bleeding. Seeing their colleague being beaten by the gang, a 
guard and a staff member of the company went out to join in the 
fight. As a result, the guard was hit on the back of his head, 
injuring his skull, and the staff member's elbow was fractured. 
They are currently hospitalized. After the incident, Mr. Lu 
Shengrui, secretary general of the Association of Taiwan 
Businessmen and general manager of the Hansheng Computer 
Company, called an emergency meeting of Taiwan businessmen in 
Wuhan to appeal to the public security department to handle this 
event, and wrote a letter of appeal entitled "Protect the 
Personal Safety of Taiwan Businessmen in Wuhan and Urgently 
Handle the Case of Beating and Injuring Mr. Zhang Tao, Legal 
Adviser of the Association," which was jointly signed by the 
association members. 
  According to a briefing by Section Head Gui from the Hubei 
Provincial Office for Taiwan Affairs, the director of the office 
said that he would correctly handle this incident when he was 
informed of it. After receiving the letter of appeal from 
Wuhan's Association of Taiwan Businessmen, Governor Jia Zhijie 
and Vice Governor Chen Shuiwen rapidly gave written instructions 
that public security organs should ascertain the facts and 
severely punish the assailants as soon as possible. However, 
more than 10 days have passed since the case was filed and there 
has not been any outcome from the investigation except a general 
query of what happened at the scene, which was conducted by the 
public security committee under the jurisdiction of the district 
authority. This has aroused great dissatisfaction among the 
parties concerned and the Taiwan businessmen in Wuhan, who said 
that they would reveal the affair to the Straits Exchange 
Foundation in Beijing [as published] and Taiwan media by fax. 
According to the above briefing, relevant departments are 
paying close attention to investigating and handling the affair, 
and have assured the Taiwan businessmen of a fair result.

<F P=106> [Report: "Shenzhen Public Security Authorities Prohibited </F>
Bei Ling, a Chinese Poet Who Holds a U.S. Green Card, From 
Leaving China; Qin Yongmin, Founding Member of `Peace Charter,' 
Sentenced to Two Years' of Labor Reform"] 
  [Text] Bei Ling, a Chinese poet who holds a U.S. green 
card, has been prohibited from leaving China by the Shenzhen 
public security authorities. At the same time, 1,000 copies of 
QINGXIANG [TENDENCY] magazine, published by Bei Ling, were also 
confiscated by the public security authorities. 
  Bei Ling is a famous Chinese poet. He emigrated and settled 
in the United States in 1988. He is now a U.S. green card 
holder. He was writer in residence at Brown University in the 
United States for a time. 
  Reportedly, Bei Ling recently published a new literature and 
humanities quarterly named QINGXIANG in the United States. 
Famous Chinese writer Bing Xing was invited to be an adviser 
for the magazine, and she also wrote the magazine's name. 
[passage omitted] 
  Yesterday, Bei Ling told MING PAO that last Friday [21 
January], he was detained by public security officers for three 
hours at the airport in Shanghai. The security officers 
thoroughly examined and searched his luggage and also questioned 
him. After Bei Ling went to Shenzhen, he was searched again by 
local public security officers, and 1,000 copies of the first 
issue of QINGXIANG were taken away by the security officers, who 
said that they would destroy them. 
  Bei Ling said that seven local public security officers 
began 
to question him last Saturday and continued to do so every day 
in an attempt to discover the background of the magazine. The 
public security authorities also prohibited him from leaving 
China and warned that if he tried to forcefully cross the border 
today, they would "arrange another place" for him to live. 
  Bei Ling said that QINGXIANG had not been distributed in 
China, but was printed in Shenzhen. He did not understand why 
such a literary and humanities quarterly would cause so much 
trouble as it was only aimed at expressing writers' wishes for 
creative freedom and publishing freedom. 
  On the other hand, Qin Yongmin, a dissident in Wuhan, was 
accused of "creating turmoil" and was sentenced by the 
authorities to two years' of reeducation-through-labor. 
  The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of 
Justice both said that they did not know about a rumored plan to 
release three political prisoners. 
  UPI quoted a Beijing source saying that Qin Yongmin, a 
dissident in Wuhan who became well-known for his opposition to 
Beijing's bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games, was sentenced by 
the Wuhan authorities to two years' reeducation-through-labor 
obviously because he had joined other comrades in launching the 
"Peace Charter." 
  The sources said: "The Wuhan Public Security Bureau accused 
him of creating social turmoil and sentenced him to two years' 
detention in a labor camp." 
  Qin Yongmin, 40, was formerly a worker in a steel works in 
Wuhan. He was also the founder of ZHONGSHENG [BELL SOUND] 
magazine. Last November, nine pro-democracy activists headed by 
Qin jointly signed the "Peace Charter" in Beijing, demanding 
that the Beijing authorities accept multiparty politics, and 
called on the people to give the government the opportunity for 
reform. As a result, he was detained by the authorities for a 
short time and sent back to Wuhan. 
  On the other hand, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs said that he knew nothing about a rumored plan 
to release three political prisoners. 
  REUTERS quoted the spokesman as saying: "To my knowledge, 
there is no such thing." 
  The Chinese Ministry of Justice also said that there was no 
such plan.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Lixian (0719 4539 2009)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Jan (XINHUA) -- Sun Xianlu, the 
criminal who hijacked an airplane with violence, was sentenced 
to life imprisonment and deprived of political rights for life 
according to law. 
  Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court, 
gave an account of the trial and judgment of Sun Xianlu's air 
hijack case at a news briefing today. 
  Sun Xianlu, 25, was a worker of the Tianjin No. 2 Steel 
Smelting Plant. In July 1993, he started an idea of hijacking 
an airliner to Taiwan and began to prepare for the criminal act. 
On 28 November 1993, he boarded a Shanghai-bound plane of the 
China International Airlines in Tianjin. Soon after the plane 
took off, he threatened to set off explosives and coerced the 
crew to fly toward Taiwan. After the crew members took some 
resolute measures, Sun Xianlu was arrested at the Nanjing 
airport. 
  After hearing the case, the Nanjing City Intermediate 
People's Court of Jiangsu Province confirmed that Sun Xianlu 
carefully plotted the hijacking and hijacked the plane by 
threatening to set off explosives, and his act was an air hijack 
crime. On 13 January 1994, the Nanjing City Intermediate 
People's Court, in accordance with the relevant law, sentenced 
Sun Xianlu to life imprisonment and deprived him of political 
rights for life on the charge of air hijacking. After the 
sentence was pronounced, Sun Xianlu did not appeal, nor did the 
procuratorial organ lodged any protest within the time 
prescribed by law. The verdict became legally effective on 25 
January. 
  Liu Jiachen pointed out: A criminal who hijacks an airplane 
with violence, coercion, or other methods is extremely dangerous 
to the society, seriously disrupts normal air travel order, 
causes great economic losses to the state, seriously jeopardizes 
the safety of passengers' lives and property, and yields very 
bad social effects. All countries and regions regard such an act 
as a serious crime and impose severe punishment for it. 
Relevant international conventions have been recognized by more 
and more countries and regions. This means that air hijackers, 
particularly those criminals who hijack civil airplanes, will be 
punished by law no matter where they escape to. 
  According to relevant reports, Huang Shugang and Liu Baocai, 
criminals who hijacked an airliner to Taiwan on 6 April 1993, 
have been sentenced to 10-year imprisonment by Taiwan region's 
judicial organ and they will not be allowed to stay in Taiwan 
after serving the term. At the same time, a common 
understanding of the cross- strait hijackers repatriation issue 
was reached between our country's Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's Straits Exchange 
Foundation in later part of December 1993. The two sides came to 
a consensus that hijacking by violence, coercion, or other 
methods is a serious crime and hijackers should be severely 
punished, and that in principle, all hijackers will be sent back 
to where they came from. 
  Liu Jiachen emphasized: Hijackers of aircraft have always 
been a target to which severe blows will be dealt according to 
China's Criminal Law. In particular, according to the "Decision 
on Punishing Hijackers of Aircraft" adopted by the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress on 28 December 1992, 
hijackers must be severely punished, or sentenced to death if 
they cause severe injury or death to other people or heavy 
damages to aircraft, or their crime is extraordinarily serious. 
Liu Jiachen said that the people's judicial organ will 
certainly impose harsh punishment on any desperadoes and 
hijackers who dare to defy the law and make a reckless move.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Muslim separatists in 
Xinjiang are becoming increasingly vocal and seriously 
threatening stability in the far northwestern Chinese region, a 
senior local security official was quoted as saying Tuesday. 
Xinjiang has undergone enormous changes in recent years with 
those seeking to split the Muslim-majority region from the rest 
of China "growing daily in ambition," the Public Security News 
[RENMIN GONGAN BAO] quoted Xinjiang's vice-director of police 
Abdula Xiti as saying. 
  The separatists are publicly calling on Muslims in Xinjiang 
to fight socialism with Islam and seeking to weaken the unity of 
the Chinese state, Abdula said. Anti-Chinese demonstrations -- 
fuelled by Muslim activists in bordering former Soviet republics 
such as Kazakhstan and Tajikistan -- have multiplied in recent 
years, causing serious concerns within the Chinese leadership. 
  Together with Tibet, Xinjiang is viewed by Beijing as a 
potential flashpoint for major ethnic unrest in China. 
  Abdula said it was necessary to use "an iron hand" in 
dealing 
with the separatists and cracking down on their "illegal 
activities." 
  In December last year, the communist party secretary for 
Tibet, Song Hanliang, said the government would take all 
necessary steps to suppress separatism spreading in the region.

Study Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Volume 3" 
column: "Deng Xiaoping's Ideas on Opening Up and Development 
and the Development of Pudong in Shanghai"] 
  [Text] Comrade Deng Xiaoping was the main decisionmaker 
and founder of the Pudong development in Shanghai. Over the 
last three years, the Pudong development has been guided by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideological line of "emancipating the 
mind and seeking truth from facts," with the 14th party 
congress's "one spearhead, three centers" as its strategic 
targets. The development has seized the historic opportunity, 
launched comprehensive development and construction, rapidly 
expanded opening up to the rest of the country and to the 
outside world, and achieved substantive progress. 
<H3>  1. Comrade Xiaoping's Decision To Develop Pudong and Steps 
for Opening Up and Development </H3>
  The Pudong development in Shanghai was announced in the 12th 
year of our country's opening up and development policy. 
In these 12 years, economic reforms made two big steps of 
great significance in regional and industrial opening up. 
  The first step, from 1979 to 1988, saw the 
establishment of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan 
Special Economic Zones and 14 economic and technological 
development zones along the coast. 
  The second step occurred in 1990 with the decision to 
develop the New Pudong District in Shanghai. 
  Both these strategic steps were personally planned and 
decided on by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. As a great historic 
figure, all of Comrade Xiaoping's decisions are made with 
insight into the world situation and are based on China's 
reality. China has a large population but a weak foundation, 
hence a comprehensive start to development and construction was 
out of the question. Economic revitalization must be 
jump-started at certain points of breakthrough. Therefore, 
Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Let some areas with the 
conditions become developed first, and let some areas develop 
slowly. Then areas that have developed will bring along the 
areas slower in development, thus leading to common prosperity." 
He repeatedly stressed: "This is a big policy, one that can 
influence and set in motion the entire national economy. I 
suggest comrades consider and study it seriously." This was a 
scientific conclusion based on 40 years of experience and 
lessons. Practice over the last decade or so has proved again 
and again that this conclusion is right and unshakable. 
  Under the auspices of Comrade Xiaoping, China's massive 
opening- up and development policy was first tested out in 
relatively backward areas adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, 
which, more exposed to economic development in developed areas, 
would have fewer labor pains and could be jump-started. A 
decade of effort finally established, step by step, a large 
group of "windows" and "bases" for opening up to the outside 
world. The areas grew from buying technology and "processing 
and assembling investor-supplied materials and components" to 
direct introduction of foreign capital, advanced technology, and 
management methods; extended domestic and foreign markets; and 
scored encouraging results. 
  At a time when south China and coastal regions have acquired 
greater experience in opening up and development, it is 
necessary -- and the conditions also permit -- to make the more 
critical second step toward regional and industrial opening up. 
So Comrade Xiaoping turned his eyes firmly toward Shanghai -- 
the fount of China's finance, trade, and industry and an 
extraordinarily large metropolitan area. 
  Early in 1990, when touring Shanghai, Comrade Xiaoping 
showed 
great concern for preparations for the Pudong development. When 
he returned to Beijing, he told Political Bureau leaders: 
Though I have retired, there is one more thing I would like to 
say, and that concerns Shanghai's Pudong development. You must 
show more concern for it. In April 1990, the Central Committee 
and State Council declared the second strategic step of opening 
up to the outside world by formally announcing the important 
decision of developing and opening up Pudong of Shanghai and 
marking it as the focus for China's opening up and development 
for the next decade. 
  From a regional development point of view, if opening up and 
development in the 1980's began with underdeveloped regions 
which did not have much influence on the national economy, then 
opening up and development in the 1990's can be said to be 
spearheaded by efforts in extraordinarily large cities and to be 
moving into the Chinese heartland. Comrade Xiaoping said in 
this regard: Once Shanghai is opened up, nothing will be the 
same for reform and opening up in the Chang Jiang Delta, the 
entire Chang Jiang region, and the whole nation." 
  From an industrial standpoint, the 1980's was characterized 
by the opening up of secondary industry, whereas the Pudong 
development in the 1990's centers on tertiary industry. Four of 
the 10 policies in central Document No. 10 have to do with 
opening up tertiary industry with foreign capital, all of them 
opening up policies of an entirely novel character, which can be 
appreciated in the opening up of tertiary industries such as 
commerce, trade, finance, and securities. This shows that 
China's opening up policy in the 1990's has extended the area of 
opening up from mainly "foreign-invested" manufacturing 
industries to tertiary industries. The integration of the 
global economy is marked by the integration of tertiary 
industries such as finance, commerce, trade, information, and 
technology. For its economy to take off, China must create a 
new dimension in its opening up to the outside world, opening up 
not only primary and secondary industries, but also tertiary 
ones in order to speed up structural adjustment and meet the 
requirements of the integration of the world economy. The 
opening up of tertiary industry requires a developed economy, 
modern communications and telecommunications, and various 
interdisciplinary and specialized professionals as a foundation. 
  According to the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's keynote 
addresses made on tours of Shanghai in the last two years, 
Shanghai's Pudong development has the following advantages: 
  1. General advantages. "Shanghai enjoys obvious advantages 
in talent, technology, and management over extensive areas," 
"Shanghai people are smart and have good quality," and "the 
popular sentiment in Shanghai is amenable, which is an infinite 
force." 
  2. Starting from a high level. In February 1991 Comrade 
Xiaoping pointed out when touring Shanghai: "Pudong development 
starts off later than Shenzhen, but from a higher level. I 
think it can catch up with and overtake Shenzhen." 
  3. A broad influence and great significance. In 1991, 
Comrade Xiaoping said: "That year the four special economic 
zones were chosen mainly out of consideration of geographical 
conditions. Shenzhen borders Hong Kong; Zhuhai is near Macao; 
Shantou because there is a large Chaozhou population in 
Southeast Asian countries; and Xiamen because there are many 
Minnan [southern Fujian] people doing business overseas. But we 
never thought of the talent advantage of Shanghai." "I wish 
that Pudong had been developed a few years earlier, like 
Shenzhen. As for the Pudong development, it is a project with 
wide influence. More than Pudong is involved here. The whole 
Shanghai development is at stake. It is nothing less than 
developing the Chang Jiang Delta and the entire river region 
through this base in Shanghai. Get a grip on Pudong and stick 
to it until it is completed." 
  Summing up the above, Comrade Xiaoping displayed the 
farsightedness and insight that befits a great historic figure 
in choosing Pudong of Shanghai as the spearhead for expanding 
opening up in the 1990's. Shanghai was formerly a financial and 
trade center and a key port on the western Pacific coast, and 
still enjoys advantages in talent, technology, and management. 
Every condition exist for restoring Shanghai to a modern 
international city through opening up and developing Pudong, 
which incidentally will give us experience in experiments in 
integrated reforms in finance, securities, trade, commerce, and 
information. It was a brilliant move by Comrade Xiaoping, the 
party Central Committee, and the State Council. 
<H3>  2. Comrade Xiaoping's Strategy for Opening Up and Developing 
Pudong and the Pursuit of the Pudong Development </H3>
  The fact that the Pudong development contains new elements 
in 
the stage of reform in which it finds itself, location, and 
industry determines that any development strategy for the 
project will have to break new ground. The New District of 
Pudong has upheld the "three orientations" and laid down the new 
strategy of "three priorities." The high level from which 
Pudong development starts can be seen in the "three priorities" 
strategies revolving around "orienting to the world, orienting 
to the future, and orienting to modernity"; and the "three 
priorities" flew from Comrade Xiaoping's strategic thought. 
  1. Priority for finance and trading. When being 
briefed by Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji on the Pudong development 
in Shanghai in February 1991, Comrade Xiaoping made some 
incisive statements on New Pudong District's "giving priority to 
financial policy": "Finance is very important and is the core 
of modern economies. With finance in good order, it will be 
like a decisive move that energizes a whole game of chess. 
Shanghai used to be a financial center and a place of free 
currency exchange. It should be the same from now on. China is 
relying on Shanghai to gain a foothold in international finance." 
  With profound thoughts characteristic of a great historic 
figure, Comrade Xiaoping spelled out in short statements what 
was significant at four different levels: First, he clarified 
the essential position of finance in a national economy; second, 
he pointed out the method for developing the economy, that is, 
focusing effort on financial reforms and development; third, he 
named the key to becoming an international financial center, 
that is, an international financial center must be a place of 
free currency exchange; and fourth, he hoped that Shanghai would 
do things according to international conventions and become a 
financial center as quickly as possible. 
  The policy of prioritizing finance has paved the way for 
foreign investment and led to flourishing finance, commerce, and 
trade in the New District of Pudong. In banking, the last three 
years saw the establishment of 38 new Sino-foreign financial 
institutions on both shores of the Pu Jiang. Banks in the new 
district boast 25 billion yuan in savings balances and 24 
billion in loan balances, 12 times the balances in 1990. The 
securities trading network in the new district is continuously 
expanding, with considerable growth in trading amounts. In the 
financial and insurance industries, total insurance in the new 
district amounts to 120 billion yuan, a fourteenfold net 
increase from 1990. Rapid development in the banking industry 
has promoted rapid growth in various trades and industries in 
the new district. In commerce, a 600,000-square-meter modern 
shopping mall complex is under construction, a number of these 
malls, covering an area of over 100,000 square meters, being 
supermarkets financed by Sino-foreign investment. Once built, 
these commercial buildings will be the country's largest 
shopping malls. The last three years saw the opening of an 
additional 25,000 industrial and commercial enterprises in the 
New District of Pudong, and this has created a climate of all 
businesses converging on the district. 
  2. Priority for infrastructural projects. 
Comrade Xiaoping said on a tour of the Nanpu Bridge project: 
Shanghai is so big. We must build a couple of big bridges. He 
stressed more than once the urgency of expediting energy, 
transport, and other key projects: "Launch whichever projects 
can be launched first; and they should command all the necessary 
funds. Launching a project a year earlier means reaping profits 
a year earlier; a delay may well stretch into the next century." 
  To improve its tangible investment environment, Shanghai 
Municipality plans to spend 15 billion yuan in the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan on the 10 great projects in the new district. At 
present, the construction of Nanpu and Yangbu Bridges, the 
Pudong section of the Yanggaolu inner ring, Waigaoqiao Port 
district, Pudong Coal Plant, and Heliu sewage plant has been 
completed, while Lingqiao Water Works and Waigaoqiao Power Plant 
are under construction. Shanghai people took three years to 
complete the infrastructural investment project scheduled for 
five years. To establish the framework of a large modern city 
as early as possible, the New District of Pudong is pressing 
ahead with the planning work for Pudong International Airport, 
the outer ring, Phase II of the electric power plan and the 
port, Pudong subway, the tunnel line connection, trunk 
communication lines, and other key projects. These urban 
projects will go into construction over the next few years and 
will lay a solid foundation for Pudong to develop into a modern 
multifunctional city with a rational urban layout, an advanced 
communication network, a convenient and easy telecommunications 
system, and a good ecological environment. 
  3. Priority for high- and new-technology 
industries. "Science and technology is the primary 
productive force" is the scientific characterization by Comrade 
Xiaoping of modern economic development. In one of his southern 
inspection tour addresses, Comrade Xiaoping stressed: "Faster 
economic development has to rely on science, technology, and 
education. One high-tech breakthrough can trigger development 
in a whole group of industries." "China must also gain a place 
in the international high-tech world." 
  Over the last three years, the New District of Pudong 
focused 
its eyes on absorbing domestic and foreign investment, gradually 
raising the technological input of the investment projects. A 
group of noted multinational corporations has transferred world 
advanced technologies to the New District of Pudong, such as the 
sophisticated chemical works from Dupont of the United States, 
Rothmaunds' autometers, programed switchboards from Bell of 
Belgium, Japan's JVC electronic products, and so on. Zhangjiang 
High- Technology Zone started operation earlier than planned and 
13 high- tech projects have moved into the zone, such as 
computer software, magnetic tubes for microwave ovens, 
integrated circuits, and so on. Some 300 scientific and 
technological groups comprising research institutes and 
institutes of higher learning have moved into Pudong. 
  In the last three years, Pudong development's "three 
priorities" strategy has, through "mutual east-west 
interaction," created a favorable impact on invigorating 
Shanghai and serving the whole country. 
<H3>  3. Comrade Xiaoping's Developmental View on Opening Up and 
Development and the New Takeoff of the Pudong Economy </H3>
  Following Comrade Xiaoping's southern inspection tour 
addresses, the New District of Pudong rapidly opened up both to 
the rest of the country and to the outside world, and China's 
reform and opening up entered a new stage. Comrade Xiaoping's 
keynote addresses are very rich in content and shot through with 
one theme: "Development is the last word [fa zhan cai shi ying 
dao li 4099 1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 3810]." 
  Economic development is the ultimate element and form of 
expression for international competition. Development is also a 
main theme for China, and in the 1990's the key to survival for 
a people. Therefore, Comrade Xiaoping demanded that we "seize 
the opportunity and develop ourselves, and the key is developing 
the economy." 
  Comrade Xiaoping stressed: "Low speed is tantamount to 
halting, even sliding backward." He also pointed out: 
"Shanghai is our ace. Getting Shanghai off the ground is a 
shortcut." "Shanghai has every condition to progress faster." 
In early 1992, Comrade Xiaoping cautioned us: Pudong 
development can move ahead and can not go back. At the present 
rate, by 1995 Pudong should see some great changes, which means 
I may still live to see it. All these instructions by Comrade 
Xiaoping pointed out that development must break out of 
equilibrium and create some momentum. 
  Aimed at Shanghai's practical situation, Comrade Xiaoping 
specifically stressed: "I hope that Shanghai people will 
emancipate the mind more, be bolder, and take greater steps," 
pointing out: Some people worry Pudong might have trouble. I do 
not think it will. Even those who worry cannot name the trouble. 
  Comrade Xiaoping made known his earnest hope for Pudong 
development in Shanghai in February 1992: "It can learn from 
the Shenzhen, Guangdong experience. Do a better job in Pudong, 
build it higher and make it more modernized." In Shanghai on 
New Year's Eve, 1993, Comrade Xiaoping again advised: "Make 
more effort this year, ride on the crest, plant the feet firmly 
on the ground, overcome difficulties, and move up to a higher 
level." 
  The greatness of a distinguished revolutionary lies in the 
fact that his strategic decisions will inevitably be transformed 
into all-embracing social practice. Comrade Xiaoping's remarks 
egg us on and make Shanghai increase the pace of opening up and 
developing Pudong and initiate comprehensive construction, which 
promotes the rapid development of Pudong's economic functions. 
  Domestic- and foreign-funded projects increased 
considerably. Before 1990, there were only 37 
"foreign-funded" enterprises in Pudong; now there are over 1,700 
foreign-invested enterprises setting up their bases in Pudong. 
Total investment from these foreign-funded enterprises amounts 
to some $5 billion, while the absorption of foreign capital 
amounts to $3 billion. Foreign- capital projects are 
characterized by large scale and high economic efficiency, 
technological inputs, and success rates; and many of them are 
multinational companies or corporations. Over 2,500 enterprises 
from the other Chinese provinces, cities, and central ministries 
have invested in Pudong a total of some 14 billion yuan. 
  Develop subdistricts, take note of strengthening 
functions. By the end of this century, the New District of 
Pudong will have built four key subdistricts, of which the 
central portion of the Lujiazui Financial Trade Zone has drawn 
up a blueprint of first-rate world standards; and over 50 
financial and commercial trade buildings are being constructed, 
with another 50 in the planning stage. The total construction 
area of the central portion is 4.1 million square meters and 
will, with Shanghai Waitan, make up China's CBD [preceding 
initials published in Roman alphabet] (central business 
district). The Jinqiaokou Export Processing Zone is 
constructing an all-purpose export processing base in pursuit of 
its targets of good economic efficiency, high-grade products, 
and an export-weighted structure, has signed contracts on 200 
domestic and foreign-funded projects, and has embarked as 
planned on the construction of over 100 projects; and 30 
projects have been completed and are in production. Waigaoqiao 
Bonded Area is taking advantage of the "domestic customs-free 
[jing nei guan wai 1064 0355 7070 1120]" situation to pursue 
vigorously international trade, bonded markets, and off-shore 
financial services; and over 1,000 domestic and foreign 
companies have moved into the area. With the operation of 
Xingan District, the area will become a genuine free-trade area. 
Zhangjiang High-Tech Garden will integrate scientific research, 
production, and services in a vigorous bid to develop high-tech 
industry and establish a new economic growth base. The pursuit 
of the above key subdistricts will lay a foundation for the 
emergence of an all-purpose modernized metropolitan pattern in 
Pudong. 
  Vibrant social and economic development. The 1993 
GDP is expected to top 16 billion yuan, more than double the 
1990 GDP, fulfilling Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee's target 
of doubling the GDP in three years' time promised to Comrade 
Xiaoping in 1991. By the end of this century, the New District 
of Pudong is expected to have raised 200 billion yuan through 
the absorption of foreign capital, joint domestic funds, bank 
financing, funds raised through securities, land rents, mutual 
funds operations, "BOT [preceding term published in Roman 
alphabet; expansion unknown]" mode, and financial inputs, to 
finance various projects in the new district, of which 40 
percent will go to infrastructure, 30 percent to modern 
high-tech industry, and the remaining 30 percent into tertiary 
industry. By then, the GDP of the New District of Pudong is 
expected to top 80 billion yuan, achieving the target of 
increasing its GDP by seven times, and by then its economic 
power will account for one-fourth of Shanghai's economy, as 
against one-fourteenth in 1990. Meanwhile, the new district is 
stepping up efforts to establish a coordinated education system 
featuring universities, special institutes of higher learning, 
technical colleges, and basic education; to build a group of 
high-end medical, cultural, and sport facilities; and to develop 
the New District of Pudong into a first- rate commercial center 
with a first-rate urban infrastructure, a first-rate all-purpose 
free-trade zone, an export and processing base, a suburban 
agricultural zone, and a high-quality residential area in 
Shanghai. 
<H3>  4. The Future Scenario Charted by Comrade Xiaoping for 
Pudong's Opening Up and Development and for the Effort To 
"Spearhead" Shanghai's Pursuit of "Three Centers" With the 
Pudong Development </H3>
  Comrade Xiaoping stressed repeatedly: "We have to create a 
few more Hong Kongs in the mainland." This is one key element 
in Comrade Xiaoping's opening up and development strategy. It 
is not aimed at creating a Hong Kong-style social system, though 
it does mean that to achieve the targets of our development 
strategy, we have to be more open and, where conditions permit, 
learn from Hong Kong's experience and allow an international 
financial, trading, and economic center to play its role. 
  The 14th party congress report points out: With the Pudong 
development as the vanguard, further develop cities along the 
Chang Jiang, and as quickly as possible develop Shanghai into 
one of the international economic, financial, and trading 
centers, with which to trigger off an economic takeoff in the 
Chang Jiang Delta and the entire river region. This is the 
demand and target set by the party for the Pudong development in 
realizing the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's addresses. 
  The conditions and potential for Shanghai to become a 
financial center. A financial center only emerges when 
there is a concentration of the headquarters or branches of 
international banks in a place which is, moreover, nourished by 
securities capital, foreign exchange, and gold markets. As the 
Pudong development unfolds, there are now over 50 banks' 
headquarters and branches and financial companies in Shanghai, 
all as legal entities, and over 80 offices of foreign-capital 
banks. In the next few years, both shores of the Pu Jiang are 
likely to add and capable of adding another 10 or more Chinese- 
and foreign-capital commercial banks or financial companies. In 
this way, by the end of this century, when Shanghai will have 
150 or more financial institutions, Shanghai will -- with the 
addition of a few other financial operations -- have every good 
condition to become a financial center. At present, various 
types of financial markets have started business and are moving 
rapidly forward in Shanghai. 
  1. Rapid development in securities markets. The 
capital trading volume of Shanghai Securities Exchange in 1992 
was 76 billion yuan, but in 1993 it is expected to have topped 
400 billion yuan. The exchange now has over 400 members and 
over 1,200 seats. Operations at the exchange are increasingly 
standardized. 
  2. A capital market taking shape. Capital 
discount volume jumped from 10 billion yuan in 1990 to 160 
billion yuan in 1992 -- proving that it is entirely possible for 
Shanghai to become a regional capital center, playing a leading 
role in financing, and helping form a monetary market in 
Shanghai. 
  3. Prospects for expanding the foreign exchange 
market. Last year 3.7 billion yuan changed hands in the 
Shanghai foreign exchange swap center. The next step should be 
slowly turning the swap center into a national foreign exchange 
trading market, with slow expansion in trading volume, the 
participation of enterprises of multiple forms of ownership and 
individuals in foreign exchange swapping, a greater variety of 
currencies traded, a widening range of discount transactions 
between foreign-exchange dealers, and development in 
foreign-exchange futures. Meanwhile, the "domestic 
customs-free" situation enjoyed by Waigaoqiao Bonded Area should 
be exploited to help launch cross-strait financial services. 
  4. Enormous potential in the gold market. 
Shanghai has a large and reputable gold jewelry market, which 
can serve as a base for the formation of a gold market, 
extending gold investment channels, creating intermediate 
agencies for the gold trade, and introducing spot gold and gold 
futures, gold certificates and accounts, and other investment 
and trading forms, eventually leading to a centralized gold 
market in conjunction with the international gold market and 
participating in its competition. 
  Conditions and potential for Shanghai to become a trade 
center. An international trade center owes its existence 
to the convergence of Chinese and foreign mercantile and trading 
houses onto a place serving cargo transhipment and domestic and 
foreign trading. The policy of opening up and developing Pudong 
provides excellent conditions for Shanghai to become a trade 
center. 
  1. Make the effort of developing and expanding futures 
trading a springboard for turning Shanghai into a trading and 
circulating center of domestic and international capital goods 
and bulk cargoes. Already in operation are metal, coal, 
petroleum, cotton, chemical, grain, and various other futures 
markets, the total trading volume of which for this year is 
expected to top 300 billion yuan and possibly over 1 trillion by 
1995, when they will have become China's largest futures markets. 
  2. Give play to the role of big ports, create 
conditions in the New District of Pudong for setting up 
foreign-trade trading companies; establish foreign-trade holding 
companies; experiment in pilot joint-investment, joint-venture 
commercial wholesaling business; and implement the new 
district's preferential policies for foreign trading in order to 
attract more international multinational [as published] 
corporations and noted trading houses to set up bases in 
Pudong. Meanwhile, actively explore ways to enhance the 
role of Waigaoqiao Bonded Area; build China's largest free-trade 
zone where things are done in conformity with international 
conventions; work hard to increase the proportion of Shanghai's 
entrepot trade in total trading volume from the present 30 
percent to over 70 percent by the year 2000; and create a 
climate such that businesses all converge on Pudong through the 
operation of the large Pudong port, with which to stimulate a 
vibrant growth in Shanghai's domestic and foreign trade. 
  3. Attract domestic and foreign capital; set up a group 
of super-wholesaling markets, supermarkets, chain shops, and 
24-hour- operation commercial networks to facilitate great flows 
of international goods in and out of Pudong, Shanghai. 
  Shanghai's conditions and potential to become an 
economic center. The formation of an economic bloc relies 
on a great modern industrial underpinning, takes large-sized 
multinational corporations and business conglomerates as the 
main force, and aims at the aggregate economic turnover and 
combined economic indicators of an international city. Shanghai 
has been making rapid progress in this direction in recent years/ 
  First, direct the effort to speed up the development of 
Pudong Jinqiao Export and Processing Zone and Zhangjiang 
High-Technology Garden, and develop Minxing Industrial 
Development Zone and Caohejing High-Technology Development Zone 
in Puxi; and introduce with selective emphases new industries 
characterized by large size, high efficiency, and a strong, 
fanning-out impact on other industries, which will create the 
necessary momentum for the emergence of a group of modern 
industries that typify the functions, status, and role of a 
mega-economic center city. 
  Second, exploiting the advantage of capital movements on 
Shanghai's finance and securities markets and Pudong's 
pathbreaking attempt to link itself up with international 
markets, we may establish a group of joint-stock, 
cross-regional, and industrially integrated business 
conglomerates at an optimal level of composition and resource 
allocation to boost competitiveness in international markets. 
  Third, strengthen the reform effort in the operation and 
management of state-owned assets in Shanghai and the New 
District of Pudong; quicken the flow of state-owned assets; and 
build dozens, even hundreds, of multinational and joint-stock 
corporations in Shanghai and Pudong to turn these two areas into 
financial command centers of multinational and joint-stock 
corporations. 
  Through the study of Comrade Xiaoping's thought on opening 
up 
and developing and the practice of the Pudong development, we 
have come to appreciate the arduousness and role of the Pudong 
development and Shanghai's reinvigoration. We firmly believe 
that, guided by the line of Comrade Xiaoping's reform and 
opening up thought, supported by the central authorities, and 
through ceaseless struggle, Shanghai will be able to take 
advantage of the time, geographical location, and personnel 
harmony and complete this great task. The party's "grand 
objective of "one spearhead, three centers" will become a 
reality with the arrival of the new century.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429), written on 19 January 1994 in Beijing: "Deng 
Xiaoping's Opportunity Theory and Keynote of NPC Session in 
March"] 
  [Text] Since the late 1970's, Deng Xiaoping, who is known 
as the chief architect of China's reform, opening up, and 
modernization, has always advocated the "theory of opportunity" 
for China's economic construction. Although this theory has 
been criticized by some people, he has never changed his point 
of view. During his inspection tour of the south in early 1992, 
he repeatedly stressed, on different occasions, the need to 
grasp the opportunity and thus increase China's comprehensive 
national strength. 
  Why has Deng adhered so persistently to the opportunity 
theory? According to sources in Beijing, this was the conclusion 
Deng drew from his assessment of the world situation. After the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in late 
1978, Deng Xiaoping reassessed the world situation then, and 
pointed out that although the danger of another world war still 
existed, forces for world peace had outgrown the forces for war, 
so it was not quite possible that another world war would break 
out, and it would be possible to maintain world peace for a 
fairly long time to come. According to this conclusion, Deng 
corrected Mao Zedong's opinion of the 1960's that another world 
war was inevitable and could even break out suddenly, and put 
forward a new thesis that peace and development were the two 
main themes of the contemporary world. Deng Xiaoping also 
adopted the national administrative guideline of focusing 
efforts on economic construction on the basis of this 
conclusion. In Deng's eyes, a peaceful international 
environment did not come easily. The opportunity must not be 
let slip, otherwise, it may not come again. So China must grasp 
the opportunity and accelerate its development. 
  Some experts on international affairs in Beijing also agreed 
that for China, whose per capita GNP is many times smaller than 
the developed nations, it is indeed necessary to make good use 
of the current peaceful environment to quicken economic 
development. They pointed out that after the end of the Cold 
War, in the global sphere, the U.S.-Soviet rivalry for world 
hegemony as a factor causing the outbreak of a world war no 
longer exists, the world situation is going to ease, and the 
occurrence of a major war has become quite impossible. However, 
in the regional sphere, the degree of turbulence has been 
aggravated. According to a statistical report published by the 
World Priority Office [shi jie you xian shi wu suo 0013 3954 
0327 0341 0057 0523 2076] on 9 November 1993, 29 wars broke out 
in the world in 1992, more than 6 million people were killed in 
wars, and total global military expenditure exceeded $600 
million. This indicates that the issue of peace has not been 
resolved. Moreover, regional unrest in Europe remains, and an 
unprecedented arms race is occurring in the Asia- Pacific 
region. The world is not as stable as some people expected. On 
the contrary, the situation has become more complicated. In 
such circumstances, if China fails to grasp the favorable 
opportunity to quicken its development, it will certainly regret 
it in the future, because such historic opportunities are rare. 
  According to sources, Deng Xiaoping's idea of "grasping the 
opportunity to accelerate development" has profound content. A 
nation's rise or decline is contingent on its comprehensive 
national strength (mainly its economic strength). Many 
developing countries and regions have maintained sustained 
economic development over 20 to 30 years. This made Deng 
Xiaoping realize that "development is the last word." He said: 
"What is the greatest danger China could face? In my view, it 
is a situation where China fails to develop its economy, lets 
the opportunity slip, and continues to lag behind other nations. 
What is the greatest hope of the common people of China? In my 
view, it is their demand for quickening reform and opening and 
boosting the economy as quickly as possible so that they can 
lead better lives." "The final solution to problems lies in 
economic development." "If the economy is developed, everything 
will be easy to handle." "The settlement of all issues in China 
relies on economic development." Recently, he stressed again: 
"In the remaining years of the 20th century, the situation will 
be favorable to China, so I think that the pace of development 
in the next few years should not be slow. Problems should be 
solved in the course of development, and development should be 
promoted through reforms. We should not be affected by the 
criticisms of some foreigners. They do not want to see a 
prosperous China. They are not doing well at present and are 
failing to sustain their development. This is precisely an 
opportunity for us." This shows that Deng's idea about 
accelerating development is related to his keen intention to 
compete with the developed nations by enhancing China's economy 
so that China can be freed from the unfavorable position of 
being subjected to pressures and constraints from other nations. 
  At the same time, while calling for quicker development, 
Deng 
did not allow people to rush headlong into disorderly action. 
He stressed: "Those who are able to develop should not be 
obstructed, and localities with favorable conditions should be 
allowed to develop as quickly as they can. As long as attention 
is paid to efficiency and quality, there is nothing worrying 
about the process of developing an outwardly oriented economy." 
This shows that although Deng is keen on continuously raising 
the economy to a new stage in a few years, he did not call for 
an unrealistic growth speed; instead, he requires that 
development should be made solidly, steadily, and in a 
well-coordinated way to achieve good economic efficiency. It is 
wrong to think that Deng only hopes for a high rate of growth 
without regard to whether the economy is overheated or whether 
the people can endure it. 
  According to the same sources, in order to further 
implement Deng Xiaoping's instruction that "development is the 
last word," the top CPC leadership has decided to make concrete 
arrangements by pooling their collective wisdom at the second 
session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], which is 
scheduled to open on 10 March. The keynote of the NPC session 
will be the acceleration of reform and opening up, and the 
meeting will mainly deal with the following three issues: 
  First, the issue of reform and development. This year is the 
year of reform in China, and economic reform will make major 
progress. Measures for reforming the management system in 
state- owned enterprises, the banking system, the finance and 
taxation system, the investment system, and the foreign trade 
system, which are known as the five pillars of the socialist 
market economy, will be put into practice so that better 
institutional conditions for economic development will be 
created. In order to prevent these reform measures from 
triggering off another upsurge in inflation which goes beyond 
the people's endurance, the authorities will adopt the option of 
making gradual and orderly progress and effecting gradual 
transition by carrying out the reform measures in phases. On the 
other hand, some new ways to develop will also be found in order 
to really shift economic development to a path of enhancing 
economic efficiency rather than mainly relying on increasing 
output value and expanding the scale of investment. 
  Second, the issue of maintaining political and social 
stability. On this issue, the top CPC leadership reached a 
consensus of opinion: "Development is the goal, reform is the 
driving force, and political and social stability is the 
guarantee. It is hoped that development will be made through 
reforms, and the people's living standards will be improved 
along with economic development. Only then will political and 
social stability be maintained, and this will in turn promote 
the reforms." As many reform measures will be adopted this 
year, more contradictions and more unstable factors may arise. 
Therefore, the authorities hold that it is necessary to 
discover and resolve problems in good time without delay, and 
problems must not pile up because this could trigger a major 
crisis. All problems should be solved as soon as they appear. 
Work teams should be dispatched to institutions and localities 
where many problems exist and cannot be solved. It is necessary 
to study forecasting trends and prepare to deal with possible 
problems. 
  Third, the issue of personnel adjustments. The top CPC 
leadership has reiterated the need to further streamline the 
administrative structure, especially in institutions which are 
overstaffed. That is to say, people who do not perform actual 
duties or who are incompetent in their work will be relieved of 
leading positions. 
  It is known that as the tasks of reform become more arduous, 
some economic experts have proposed that more cadres with 
knowledge of economics should be appointed to the State Council 
and concerned departments, and some have even proposed that such 
cadres should be selected from Shanghai, because Shanghai is 
playing a more and more important role in the country as a whole 
and is also a place where many talented people gather. People 
will see whether the CPC leadership adopts this proposal by 
observing personnel appointments at the NPC session in March.

<F P=106> [Report by station reporters Wang Yanqing and Liu Zhenying; </F>
from the "National Hookup" program] 
  [Text] The national conference on propaganda and 
ideological work called by the CPC Central Committee took place 
at the Great Hall of the People this morning. 
  In addressing the conference, Jiang Zemin, general secretary 
of the CPC Central Committee, pointed out: Propaganda and 
ideological work has a close bearing on the cause of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Party committees at all 
levels must attach great importance to this task. They must 
strengthen their leadership and shoulder responsibility in this 
regard. 
  He stressed: Propaganda and ideological work requires arming 
people's minds with scientific theories, guiding them with 
correct public opinion, molding them with a lofty spirit, and 
inspiring them with outstanding works so that generations of 
socialist-minded people who have lofty ideals, who are ethical 
and educated, and who have a high sense of discipline can be 
constantly trained and cultivated, and so that during the great 
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we 
will have a powerful ideological guarantee and the support of 
the media. 
  Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao, Ding 
Guangen, 
Li Lanqing, Li Tieying, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Ren Jianxin, 
and other comrades attended the conference, which was chaired by 
Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau and Secretariat, 
and head of the Propaganda Department, of the CPC Central 
Committee. 
  The main agenda of the conference is to study ways and means 
to intensify and improve ideological and propaganda work under 
the new situation, doing so under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and that of the party's basic line, by following 
the guidelines laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, and by following the principle of 
being firm in carrying out material construction and promoting 
socialist ethics at the same time. 
  In his speech, General Secretary Jiang Zemin focused on 
issues in three respects: first, the importance of intensifying 
propaganda and ideological work during the new period; second, 
the basic guidelines and major tasks of propaganda and 
ideological work; and third, the party must intensify and 
improve its leadership over propaganda and ideological work. 
  Jiang Zemin said he hoped that the conference will enable 
party leaders at all levels and comrades working on the 
propaganda and ideological front to have a clearer idea of the 
task of overall importance, achieve a consensus of views, and 
work earnestly with higher morale so as to create a new 
situation for propaganda and ideological work, and do an even 
better job of rallying and inspiring the vast number of party 
members and people to push forward the cause of reform, opening 
up, and modernization. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out: The basic policy of the work of the 
whole party is, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
that of the party's basic line, to fully implement the 
guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and its 
third plenary session; speed up the building of the socialist 
market economic system; maintain the sustained, fast, and 
healthy development of the national economy; safeguard social 
stability; and promote social progress in all sectors. The most 
important mission of the party is to seize the opportunity to 
deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote 
development, and maintain stability. All party comrades must 
understand this mission of overall importance, obey and serve 
this mission, and take the initiative in accomplishing the work 
in all fields as required by this mission. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the basic 
guiding principle for all party projects. Comrades working on 
the propaganda and ideological front must firmly adhere to this 
basic guideline and use it as the guide for all their work. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Today and in the time to come, we must pay 
special attention to the work in four respects. First, the most 
important task of the propaganda and ideological front is to arm 
the minds of all party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Second, we must persist in implementing the party's basic line 
and in providing public opinion with the proper guidance. 
Third, we must make ideological education a success to bring up 
people who have lofty ideas, who are ethical and educated, and 
who have a high sense of discipline, so as to expedite socialist 
spiritual construction. Fourth, we must adhere to the course of 
serving the people and socialism, uphold the principle of 
letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of 
thought contend, foster the main theme, and bring about a boom 
in socialist literature and art. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: While promoting socialist spiritual 
construction through propaganda and cultural work, we must do 
several things. First, we must give top priority to its social 
results [ba she hui xiao yi fang zai shou wei] and integrate 
economic and social results on this basis. Second, we should 
approach our nation's traditional culture and culture from 
abroad with a scientific attitude. Third, we must persist in 
spiritual construction and place emphasis on construction and 
better management. 
  Jiang Zemin also fully endorsed the results achieved by the 
comrades working on the propaganda and ideological front. He 
said: The vast number of comrades on the propaganda and 
ideological front are loyal to the cause of the party and the 
people, and they have accomplished a good deal of work in 
publicizing the party's basic theory and basic line; in 
promoting reform, opening up, and modernization; and in 
promoting socialist ethics, and they have made significant 
contributions in those areas. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: The Central Party Committee trusts the 
contingent of propaganda and ideological workers, and the party 
and the people have high hopes for them. Under Comrade 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, I hope that you will make every effort to 
achieve even greater success, press forward, and work hard to 
bring propaganda and ideological work to a new level. 
  Present at the conference were responsible comrades and 
propaganda department directors of party committees of various 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under 
the central government's jurisdiction, and responsible persons 
from various central departments and committees. Also present 
at the conference were comrades attending the working conference 
of the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Radio, Film, and 
Television; the State Council Information Office, the State 
Press and Publications Administration, the General Political 
Department of the People's Liberation Army, and RENMIN RIBAO and 
the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY.

  [Text] Beijing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- A major shift is to 
take place in China's media and publications industry. 
  "That is, from swelling in numbers and scale, to emphasis on 
quality and efficiency," Yu Youxian, director of the State Press 
and Publications Administration, told a national meeting which 
opened here today. 
  In the past 10-odd years, he said, the number of newspapers 
and magazines has grown from 1,000 to more than 10,000, and that 
of publishing houses has exceeded 800. 
  "The speed has exceeded the country's capacity to support 
them," he said. 
  The situation has caused concern among the public, he said. 
And the up-coming change will be in line with the emphasis on 
efficiency in the national economy. 
  He called for insisting on a correct political line in media 
and publications work. Meanwhile, administrative mandates 
should be reduced to a minimum and replaced by legal measures. 
In addition, he said, the sector will be mainly run as an 
enterprise instead of a government department. 
  Meanwhile, the draft of a press law, China's first, is 
expected to be speeded up this year, he revealed. 
  And the country will continue its campaign to crack down on 
illegal publications, including pornographic ones, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, January 24 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
leader called for strict control over population growth, while 
concentrating on development of the national economy. 
  Peng Peiyun, State Councillor and minister in charge of the 
State Family Planning Commission, made the remark at a seminar 
on China's population closed here on Sunday [23 January] in 
Beijing. 
  Peng said that it is prerequisite to continue to carry out 
the policy of birth control in order to achieve China's 
strategic goal in the future. 
  The family planning work must be handled in a climate of 
social and economic development, Peng said, adding it must also 
be done well to create a good environment of population for the 
country's socialist modernization drive. 
  Due to a large population base, China is still facing a grim 
situation in birth control, she said, adding that it is urgent 
to build a family planning structure in line with China's 
socialist market economic structure. 
  Peng continued that close attention should be paid to the 
following aspects in dealing with national family planning: 
  -- what is most important is to redouble efforts to keep the 
birth rate down, which still remains high in some areas in the 
country. 
  The development of family planning is uneven across the 
country and outdated beliefs regarding birth still exist among 
sectors of the Chinese population, Peng said. 
  In addition, new problems concerning the birth control may 
also occur in the course of establishing a socialist market 
economy. 
  As a result, China's family planning will take long-term and 
hard work and should not be neglected at any time. 
  -- forceful measures should be taken to provide for better 
births and better education, in a bid to improve the quality of 
the population, Peng urged. 
  Of the more than 50 million disabled in the country, more 
than 10 million were born with deformities, and there are now 
4.17 million disabled children under 14 with birth defects, 
accounting for more than half of all disabled children, Peng 
said. 
  Of every one thousand newborns, 13 suffer from birth 
defects. 
  Also, over 400 million people are living in iodine-deficient 
areas, which could cause the birth of hundreds of thousands of 
mentally retarded children by the year 2000 if the problem was 
not solved. 
  She added that there are also 180 million illiterates or 
semi- literates in the country presently. 
  -- efforts should be made to promote the establishment of 
pensions and life insurance. 
  Peng warned that China is also facing the problem of aging 
due to a decline in the birth rate and a rise in average life 
expectancy of the population. 
  -- equality between men and women should also be advocated 
and measures taken to protect women's rights and interests and 
lift their social status. 
  Peng added that this is crucial because females have fallen 
behind males in China's current sex proportion. 
  -- last but not least, Peng said, urbanization must also be 
advanced in a planned way. 
  She added that the surplus rural labor force should be 
encouraged to flow in an orderly manner between regions and to 
transfer to job vacancies in non-farm sectors, as the country's 
urbanization has been quickened since the policy of reform and 
opening was instituted in the late 1970s. 
  Peng concluded that this is also an important issue that has 
close bearing on China's economic development and social 
stability.

  [Text] Beijing, January 24 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Education Society recently held a forum on highlighting the 
strategic position of education in China. 
  The scholars at the forum called for giving more priority to 
basic education while economic development is set as the central 
task. 
  They noted that leaders at various levels should attach more 
importance to education. 
  Liu Bin, vice-minister in charge of the State Education 
Commission, said that development of basic education has seen a 
decline in China with problems such as shortage of educational 
funds and postponing payment of teachers' salaries. 
  He said that the problems should be noted in society, 
especially by leaders at various levels. 
  Gong Yuzhi, deputy director of the party Literature Research 
Center of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, 
said that the question of education has an important position in 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and urged leaders in central departments and 
localities to check the tendency to give education short shrift 
in their economic development. 
  Tao Xiping, director of the Beijing Education Bureau and 
deputy to the National People's Congress (NPC), said that 
China's compulsory education law has been promulgated for more 
than seven years and now a teachers' law has also come into 
force. He expressed hope that the implementation of the laws of 
education should be enhanced so as to ensure the strategic 
position of the development of education. 
  Lei Jieqiong, vice-chairwoman of the NPC Standing Committee, 
and some leaders of democratic parties also attended the forum.

  [Text] Beijing, January 25 (CNS) -- Minister of Culture 
Mr. Liu Zhongde, speaking at the opening ceremony of a national 
work conference attended by heads of departments and bureaus, 
talked on the guidance and basic duty for cultural work this 
year. 
  Mr. Liu said that proper mastery of Deng Xiaoping's 
Selected Works was the most important task for 
cultural departments of various levels at this time. He called 
for the application of the works in analysis and research on the 
building up, restructuring and practice of administration of 
China's cultural undertakings. 
  He added that this year would witness further reform of the 
economic system which in turn made the speeding up and the 
deepening of restructuring of the cultural system of great 
urgency. It was not enough just keeping in line with the 
economic system as required, but it was also vital to the 
prosperity and development of socialist cultural undertakings. 
  The ministry had to finish internal and structural reform 
this year while at the same time switching its functions from a 
management pattern based on the planned economy system in the 
past to one in line with the market economy system. Mr. Liu 
pointed out that the key to reform of the cultural system set 
for this year would lie in the restructuring of the system for 
arts performing groups. 
  He added that the ministry would strengthen administration 
of 
the cultural market during the year including the pushing 
forward of legislation on cultural undertakings, further 
improvement of the market law and regulation system, the putting 
into order of the audio-visual product market, the performing 
sector, entertainment circles and the newspaper and magazine 
market. The cultural market should be put under standardized 
administration and inspection should be strengthened. 
  The meeting which will close on January 29 is centered on 
the 
formulation of proposals on reform of the cultural system and 
this year will see the greatest number of reform measures to be 
adopted by the ministry.

  [Text] Beijing, January 21 (XINHUA) -- The Cultural 
Ministry has decided to give high-tastes in arts a notable place 
at its Spring Festival evening party. 
  At the party to be staged during the traditional holiday 
next 
month, a repertoire which lauds the ongoing reform and opening 
or reflects traditional culture or serious arts will be 
emphasized, Zeng Qinghuai, planner of the show from the Cultural 
Ministry, said here today. 
  However, the event will leave room for a few pop singers. 
And a piece written by a Taiwanese composer will be sung. 
  The programs are aimed to help promoting serious culture 
while promoting artistic forms which can be received by ordinary 
people. 
  In recent years China's cultural market has been hit by 
growing pop arts while traditional and classical arts have 
fallen into a slump. More television cameras have been lured 
away for commercial singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
  This has triggered conflicting opinions among the fans. Some 
complained that their rights to watch various artistic programs 
were denied, according to Zeng. 
  Since last year, Chinese leaders have repeatedly urged 
supporting traditional and serious arts, and letting the arts 
serve the people and socialism. 
  The ministry's evening party, which will be broadcast on 
state television, will give a potential audience of 600 million 
a chance to enjoy symphonic music, ballet, acrobatics and 
traditional opera. 
  But almost at the same time, another more famous evening 
party will be organized and televised by the same TV station. 
It will feature a more popular repertoire and is viewed as 
regular family fare during every Spring Festival. 
  These events may revive people by providing them with a 
healthy and vivid cultural atmosphere, the Cultural Ministry 
hopes. And they set a "right tune" for the Chinese arts this 
year, experts said. 
  "The evening party is not mere entertainment. It shows our 
policy, the achievements and prospects of the field, as well as 
the whole reform and opening process in the country," Zeng said.
