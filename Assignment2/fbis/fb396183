<F P=106> [Unattributed article; part 27 in the series: "The </F>
Coalition -- A Revolving Stage": "The Coalition's Tax Reform"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 21 December, the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] Tax System Research Council 
held its first meeting in the conference room of the Diet 
members' office. 
  Chairman Ichiro Hino opened the meeting by saying: "The tax 
system has become more important than ever. The party should 
work out a thorough assessment." 
  Discussions were quietly carried on for about 90 minutes, 
and 
the SDPJ adopted its tax reform policy for fiscal 1994. 
  The SDPJ policy includes many points of interest to 
industrial circles, such as a review of consumption tax 
exemption for smaller businesses, maintenance of the land price 
tax, and heavier taxation on nonprofit foundations. However, no 
businessmen gathered around awaiting the results of the SDPJ 
policy meeting, unlike that of the former ruling party -- the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Even though the SDPJ is the 
largest party in the coalition, it is no more than one of the 
coalition parties. 
  The coalition's tax reform policy is firmed up by the "tax 
reform working group." As the subgroup of the conference of 
secretaries of five floor groups, the working group is organized 
by five Dietmen specializing in tax issues. 
<H5>  Everything Is Secret </H5>
  In principle, the membership and agenda of the five-man 
working group have been kept "secret." In fact, however, 
business circles sniffed out the existence of the group, and the 
members were chased around by a large number of petitioners. A 
member of the working group complained: "Even government 
officials from some ministries came to us to make petitions with 
business people. Nothing has changed after the LDP meltdown." 
  The working group is charged with examining individual 
special tax laws, which stipulate favorable tax policies for 
specific industrial fields. The group examines every single 
special tax to determine whether it should be continued or 
scrapped. The final decisions, though, are sometimes left to a 
meeting of party secretaries when members cannot reach 
agreement, or when the tax under debate involves a huge amount 
of revenue. 
<H5>  Business Leaders Wonder Who Makes the Decisions </H5>
  Business circles are perplexed by the coalition's new 
decisionmaking process because they have long been used to 
dealing with only the LDP tax board. Business leaders wonder 
"who is really in charge of compiling the coalition's tax reform 
guidelines, and where should we go to make petitions." 
  Hajime Tsuboi, director of the National Association of Real 
Estate Agents and concurrently chairman of Mitsui Real Estate 
Sales Co., called on Secretary Kansei Nakano of the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP] on the morning of 20 December. Tsuboi 
asked Nakano to "scrap the heavy taxes on real estate 
transactions and on owners of real estate." This was the second 
time Tsuboi has petitioned Nakano, following their first meeting 
in September. 
  Tsuboi also met Shinseito's Mamoru Nakajima and the SDPJ's 
Nobuyuki Sekiyama on 7 and 10 December, respectively. It 
appears Tsuboi has a strategy of meeting policymakers from all 
five floor groups as frequently as possible to present his 
opinions on the coalition's tax policy. However, he complained: 
"Everyone understands land transactions should be further 
liberalized to boost the economy, but all of them said, `the 
Finance Ministry is too stubborn to give up the tax revenues'." 
  The association's secretariat has recently drawn up a list 
of 
the five party secretaries, the five members of the working 
group, and seven other political figures who accept petitions, 
with accompanying photographs and profiles of each. According 
to an association official, nobody was familiar with the names 
on the list, except for the party secretaries, until the people 
had been introduced in trade journals. In fact, most never came 
to public notice until the coalition took power. 
  On the night of 17 December, the coalition gave up plans to 
submit the government's fiscal 1994 budget plan before the 
year-end. 
  Nissan Motor Company Managing Director Heiichi Hamaoka, who 
is concurrently serving as the chairman of the Japan Automobile 
Manufacturers' Association [JAMA] Tax System Committee, 
responded in disgust: "I am really disappointed with the 
cease-fire announcement because JAMA is now ready to negotiate 
with the Finance Ministry." 
  When the commodity tax was replaced by the consumption 
tax, which imposes a 3-percent tax on every purchase, the 
government left a higher tax rate of 4.5 percent only for 
automobiles as a tentative measure. The 4.5-percent tax on 
automobiles will expire the end of March 1994; however, the 
Finance Ministry has begun to hint at seeking an extension of 
the extra taxation on the pretext of revenue shortages. In 
reaction, JAMA leaders have been making positive contacts with 
senior leaders of the coalition parties since November, 
insisting that "the tax should be lowered to 3 percent because 
this is the way for the government to keep faith with industrial 
circles." 
  Hamaoka has already met with all politicians concerned, 
including the five party secretaries in charge of tax issues. 
Yet, he said "I could not figure out who is the real 
decisionmaker." 
  Shinseito has many industrial lobbyists, and the DSP is 
backed by the Federation of Japan Automobile Workers' Unions. 
The two parties stress "we would never submit a bill for 
extending the extra taxation even if we had a big fight with the 
Finance Ministry" (as noted by the DSP's Nakano). 
  On the contrary, the SDPJ virtually supports the extension 
of 
the high consumption tax for automobiles. SDPJ Secretary 
Harumichi Hosoya said: "Scrapping the special tax when it 
expires is favorable from a political viewpoint. But we 
probably cannot afford to do that under the present financial 
situation." Also, Komeito shows understanding of the Finance 
Ministry position, noting that, "If the tax rate for automobiles 
is lowered to 3 percent, tax revenues would decline 100 billion 
yen." 
<H5>  Taxation Is Politics </H5>
  Under the LDP ruling, the Finance Ministry has been leaving 
the decision on scrapping and continuing individual special 
taxes to the LDP tax board -- at least in its official posture. 
At that time, ministry opinions were conveyed to the LDP 
through the government's advisory Tax System Research Council. 
  Unlike the preceding years, the fiscal 1994 budget is being 
compiled under the Finance Ministry Tax Bureau's direct control. 
The new "budget compilation system" estimates budget allotments 
at the Tax Bureau's initiative, while expectations of business 
circles are probed through the appropriate ministries. When 
coalition parties cannot agree with each other on specific 
issues, the Finance Ministry's judgment becomes heavier. 
  Nevertheless, the Finance Ministry has its concerns. A 
middle-ranking Tax Bureau official noted: "Nobody complained 
about the LDP tax board's final decision. But we no longer have 
such a barrier. Since tax-related decisions involve much 
political judgment, I am not confident that bureaucrats are able 
to assume all the responsibilities for next year's taxation." 
  The 1994 tax reform agenda was postponed when the coalition 
government gave up the completion of the fiscal 1994 budget plan 
before year-end. Both the coalition and the bureaucrats will 
have to keep groping in the dark.

<F P=106> ["DAIYAMONDO Report" article by Susumu Saito, representative </F>
director of Sankyoku Economic Research Institute: "Tokyo Stocks 
Plunge! Government Should Do Its Utmost To Avoid Worldwide 
Financial Uncertainty"] 
  [Text] Indicators, one after another, are showing a further 
decline of the level of Japan's economic activities. 
  Among them, the Industrial Production Index [IPI] decreased 
5.1 percent in October over the previous month, the worst rate 
of decline in 40 years since the index has been taken. Based on 
the forecast indexes for November and December issued by the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], the 
seasonally adjusted index for the October-December period in 
1993 declined 3.1 percent from the previous quarter's [the 
July-September period's] 91.7, down 13.0 percent to 88.9 (1990 = 
100) in terms of annual rate. 
  After the index hit 92.7 in the October-December 1992 
period, 
it reached 93.1 in the January-March 1993 period which is a 
temporary increase of 0.4 percent from the previous period, but 
then dropped 1.5 percent to 91.7 in the second quarter. 
  The forecast mentioned above for the production level in the 
October-December period in 1993 is 4.1 percent lower than the 
corresponding period of last year which was considered to be the 
bottom. As far as the IPI is concerned, the current state of 
economic activities can be described as "double dip" in terms of 
both "level" and "trend." Now the actual statistics can be said 
to start supporting this writer's warning that the economy in 
the latter half of 1993 is in extreme danger, which was made 
through this magazine in mid-June, a half year ago. Besides, 
there is still no guarantee that the economy will stop to 
deteriorate any further. . 
<H5>  Effective Demand Policy Is Effective </H5>
  The IPI trend has been on the decline for three years since 
its peak 102.7 in the January-March 1991 period, and the index 
may fall 13.4 percent in the October-December 1993 period. 
Compared to the index's decline at the time of the first oil 
crisis of 1973, which continued for nearly a year and a half, 
the current decline in production has already lasted two times 
longer. 
  Behind this strong contractionary pressure is the financial 
system malfunction caused by the steep fall in the value of 
assets such as stocks and real estate since early 1990. It not 
only acted as a sudden break on the expansion of private 
investment (plant and equipment investment plus investment in 
housing) but also worked to largely push down the level of 
private investment. The amount of private investment decreased 
sharply from its peak in the January-March 1991 period to the 
April-June 1993 period, approximately 13.6 trillion yen in 
accumulation. The steep reduction in investment will cause a 
contraction in production and income with a time lag. 
  However, the private sector is not the only one which makes 
investments. The increase and decrease in public investment by 
the government also causes fluctuations in production and 
income, as private investment does. In the same period when the 
above-mentioned private investment was declining steeply, public 
investment, due to the implementation of an economic stimulus 
package, indeed increased to about 10.4 trillion yen. 
Nevertheless, the increase of seemingly extremely large-scale 
public investment was still not enough to complement the amount 
of private investment decrease. The fact is that the gross 
investment, private and public investments combined, declined 
approximately 3.2 trillion yen during the same period mentioned 
above. 
  Private investment, like plant and equipment investment, can 
be considered to have a larger multiplying effect on expanding 
income than public investment. However, even if the multiplying 
effects of private and public investment were regarded as the 
same for the simplicity of discussion, there is no wonder about 
the continuation of a negative growth trend in which the level 
of production and income had a tendency to decline for the last 
two years when the total amount of investment had decreased over 
a long period of time. 
  It is clear from this observation that a further and rapid 
expansion of public investment which does not conform to the 
norm of so-called "economic measures" of the postwar period was 
necessary to increase production and income by expanding the 
gross investment during the private investment's decline. In 
other words, we should think that the Japanese economy, affected 
seriously by the decrease in private investment, would have been 
in a more serious situation than it is now if the 
above-mentioned public investment of about 10.4 trillion yen 
were not made. Those who might simply claim that the Keynesian 
effective demand policy has lost its validity should give enough 
thought to this point. 
<H3>  Why Is the Emergency Economic Stimulus Package 
Unsatisfactory? </H3>
  An immediate problem related to the sudden fall of stock 
prices this fall is that there was the risk that the gross 
investment may decline by about 6.3 trillion yen in accumulation 
within fiscal 1993, even if business managers' own plans for 
plant and equipment investment and the trend for a possible 
public investment were taken into consideration. 
  Considering the risk of this sharp reduction in the gross 
investment, it can be easily understood that the Hosokawa 
cabinet's emergency economic stimulus package totaling 
approximately 6.15 trillion yen announced on 17 September was 
truly not enough to avoid the risk of further economic slump due 
to the gross investment's decline. Not all of the emergency 
pump-priming package's money lead to the increase in public 
investment but most of it was just a loan plan taking over the 
role of private financial institutions. 
  With the Hosokawa cabinet's emergency economic stimulus 
package alone, not only the present decline in gross investment 
cannot be stopped [but also there are some other problems]. 
Under the situation in which plant and equipment investment 
might see a further decrease in the next fiscal year, a 
prediction can be easily made that it is natural even if the 
contractionary pressure on production and income, caused by the 
decline in gross investment due to the insufficient increase of 
public investment, continues throughout fiscal 1994, when the 
time lag between the changes in investment and the changes in 
production and income is taken into consideration. 
  It can be naturally expected under such circumstances that 
there is the risk that corporate earnings may continue to 
decline in fiscal 1994 from fiscal 1993. In early fall this 
year, the prospective price-earnings ratio for the 225 listed 
issues in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange [TSE] 
reached an unstable stage of around 90 times. To stabilize 
stock prices by reducing the price-earnings ratio in such a 
situation, the lowering of interest rates was required as a 
matter of course, but it was more important to be able to expect 
an increase in corporate earnings as the expansion of the 
economy raises the sales of companies. However, such was 
impossible under the emergency economic package that actually 
came out. The only way left was the downward adjustment of 
stock prices. The steep fall of stock prices can be said to be 
inevitable. The release of private corporations' worsening 
mid-term earnings reports in September and the listing of East 
Japan Railway Co. stock in the TSE were just triggers. 
  In addition, what made the situation more serious was the 
confused discussion of short-term economic stimulus measures and 
policies that may increase the economic efficiency in the 
long-term, such as deregulation, and measures to pass on the 
exchange rate profits to consumers. It is only natural if such 
governmental confusion were criticized as it created an illusion 
that new corporations will be established immediately and 
employment opportunities will increase once deregulation is 
promoted, and therefore played a role in neglecting the 
discussion of demand management to prevent the economy's "double 
dip" 
<H5>  Risk for Worldwide Simultaneous Low Stock Prices </H5>
  The Nikkei average declined steeply since it marked a 
recovery high of 21,448 on 13 September. Nevertheless, the 
prospective price-earnings ratio for 225 issues listed in the 
first section of the TSE has still been around 80 times lately. 
Because of this, Japanese stock prices appear to be 
significantly higher to the eyes of the cool-headed investors in 
the light of Japan's profit and interest rate levels. 
  While a strong potential downward pressure is still being 
applied on Japanese stock prices, the fact that Western stock 
price levels have become abnormally high in light of Western 
investment standards -- New York's prospective price-earnings 
ratio increasing from 25 to 30 times, for example -- is 
complicating the situation. As it is now reported in Japan, 
even companies which are not suited for a stable long-term 
investment are disclosing their stocks at the over-the-counter 
market in New York. This kind of speculation in stocks can be 
collapsed anytime, triggered by a slight increase in interest 
rates. Such signs [to indicate the market is on the verge of a 
crash] have been emerging rapidly since this fall. 
  Prior to the heavy fall of New York stock prices in October 
1929, Joseph Kennedy, father of the late President Kennedy, 
realized that the collapse of stock prices was approaching when 
he saw that even a shoeshine boy was absorbed in playing the 
stock market, and he was able to save himself from the stock 
price fall by selling all of his holdings. 
  If the announcement of a concrete additional economic 
stimulus package is delayed due to the confusion and delay of 
the political reform debate in the Diet, then it can be easily 
expected that the potential downward pressure on Japanese stock 
prices will become more tangible. If it happens to trigger New 
York stock prices to plunge at once, it could rebound to the 
Japanese stock prices, initiating a vicious cycle. In that 
case, it will be extremely difficult for the policy-making 
authorities to stop the steep fall of Japanese stock prices. 
  Based on the steep decline of stock prices since late 
October 
this year, the 225-issue Nikkei average around 12,000, which is 
said to wipe out the stocks' latent profits of most of the 
Japanese banks, is within hailing distance. There is no wonder 
if the failure of a bank which carries a huge amount of bad 
loans comes to the surface. Without the help of the central 
bank as "the last lender," the situation might cause a loss of 
confidence in the financial system itself. 
  Banks which have virtually fallen into liability excesses 
by the increase of bad loans due to the fall of stock prices 
will not be able to raise funds from the short-term money 
market. If there is not enough supply of liquidity from the 
central bank, banks will be required to sell more of their 
securities, whose liquidity is high, at markets both at home and 
abroad. That will cause further turbulence in the capital 
market both at home and abroad, and the fall in asset prices 
will suffocate the banks, producing a vicious cycle. Because of 
the depletion in asset prices, it will be difficult for the 
banks to meet the demand for private corporations' operating 
funds as the end of fiscal 1993 nears. Settlement accidents 
resulting from a bank failure in Japan have a great risk of 
immediately expanding to a worldwide financial uncertainty 
through the international chain of credit. 
  If the decline in asset values, like stock prices, etc., 
cannot be stopped because of a delay in financial measures, the 
bank failure scenario will no longer be unreal. 
  The government and financial authorities are required to 
fully inspect the contingency plan, including unlimited special 
lending measures, and to reconfirm the utmost level of political 
leadership to carry out the plan to avoid the risk that a 
domestic bank crisis, which may occur frequently at the same 
time, may lead to a worldwide financial uncertainty.

  [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- Armed bandits of 
the South Korean puppet army took positions in Paju County and 
Chorwon and Yanggu Counties, South Korean Kangwon Province, 
areas under the eyes of the North, on December 28 and staged a 
war exercise against the North, firing large-calibre machinegun 
and automatic rifle bullets at random, according to military 
sources. 
  Formations of helicopter gunships and transport helicopters 
flew above Paju, Yonchon and Chorwon Counties in an exercise of 
air support to ground attack units and war materiel airlifting. 
  Such war exercises of the South Korean puppets are 
premeditated provocative acts to incite North-South 
confrontation and increase the danger of war.

<F P=106> ["Desperate Fascist Frenzy" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 2 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
denounces the Kim Yong-sam group for throwing off the "civilian" 
veil and openly making fascist remarks these days. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam, branding the struggle of students 
and people against the policy of rice market opening as "a 
radical violent demonstration", threatened that "an unequivocal 
and resolute stand" would be taken toward it. And the puppet 
home minister, Choe Hyong-u, said "torture is permissible in 
interrogating political prisoners." 
  This is an open threat to the pro-democracy forces and a new 
directive to suppress all people opposed to the traitorous 
"government" with the fascist bayonet, notes the news analyst, 
and continues: 
  It is only too natural that the South Korean people should 
fight to build a new world free from aggressor and traitor. 
They can by no means be a target of repression at the point of 
the bayonet. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has turned South Korea into a 
more terror-ridden pandemonium of fascism than the dictatorial 
"government" of the "Sixth Republic" and is wringing the neck of 
the people with such treachery as rice market opening. Why 
should the people sit idle as if dead? It is the Kim Yong-sam 
traitorous clique that must be thrown behind bars in South Korea. 
  The venomous remarks of the Kim Yong-sam group are a 
desperate fascist frenzy motivated by its fear of the 
ever-growing anti-puppet, anti-"government" struggle of the 
people. 
  It is inevitable that the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique 
will 
encounter stronger resistance from the people.

<F P=106> ["No Need To Watch South Korean `Regime' and Nothing To </F>
Expect From It"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- Now the South Korean 
people and public figures are courageously turning out in the 
anti-puppet, anti-"government" struggle" under the slogan "down 
with the Kim Yong-sam government", saying that there is no need 
to watch the Kim Yong-sam "civilian regime" any longer and that 
they have nothing to expect from it, says NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article Tuesday. 
  After coming to power under the "civilian" veil in February 
last year the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, has turned his 
back on the South Korean people and the whole nation and 
committed a long string of treacheries, outdistancing the 
preceding military fascist rulers, the article says, and goes on: 
  One of the grisliest crimes committed by the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam and his "civilian government" is that they have taken 
the road of dependence on foreign forces, not national 
independence, and of North-South confrontation, not national 
unity, turning away the hand stretched by fellow countrymen for 
the reconciliation, unity and reunification of the North and 
South. 
  Kim Yong-sam the traitor resumed the "Team Spirit" nuclear 
war exercises against the North on a larger scale in collusion 
with the U.S. imperialists, the war game which had been 
suspended in the closing years of the "sixth republic" and, at 
"summit talks" and "annual security consultative meeting" 
between South Korea and the United States and during his trip of 
the United States, he asked the United States to shelve a 
programme to cut back its troops present in South Korea and keep 
the U.S. troops in South Korea for an indefinite period in 
return for his promise to allocate more than 3 billion dollars 
for the maintenance of its troops, and place South Korea under 
the U.S. "nuclear umbrella". 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has made desperate efforts to 
get "sanctions" imposed upon the DPRK and set up an 
"international cooperation system" against it by spreading the 
fiction of "suspicion of nuclear development by the North" 
invented by the imperialist reactionary forces in a bid to 
stifle our republic, the bastion of socialism. 
  Never to be condoned are the crimes committed by the Kim 
Yong-sam fascist "regime" in turning South Korea into a fascist 
pandemonium worse than under the "sixth republic" military 
dictatorial "regime" and brutally suppressing the students and 
people calling for independence, democracy and reunification. 
  It is only too natural that the South Korean people bitterly 
condemn the present Kim Yong-sam puppet regime as a "civilian 
fascist regime" and the "second-term government of the sixth 
republic" which has replaced "military fascism with civilian 
fascism". 
  The Kim Yong-sam group committed a towering crime by putting 
a spoke in the wheel of the democratic development of the South 
Korean society and driving the economy and people's living to 
the worst phase through deceptive "reforms". 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has taken the road of 
dependence on outside forces, not national independence, and of 
North-South confrontation, not national reconciliation and 
unity, going against the desire of the nation for independent 
reunification and is fooling the people with hypocritical 
"reforms". This is what the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has done 
under the cloak of "civilian politics". 
  The traitor and fascist tyrant forsaken by the country and 
the nation will face a stern judgement by history.

  [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam cried for "labor-management concord", blaring that he 
would make the new year "the first year of settlement of 
labor-management relations." Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN 
today says: 
  By "labor-management concord" Kim Yong-sam the puppet means 
that the workers must submit to the demands of the employers and 
their exploitation and plunder, not fighting to push demands 
such as wage hike. 
  The analyst further says: 
  In the first days of his office the traitor harshly 
suppressed the struggle of workers for such demand as higher pay 
by invoking even the "emergency arbitration power." 
  In reiterating the deceptive doctrine on "labor-management 
concord" the reactionary nature of which has been brought into a 
glaring light, he hinted that he would force harder toil upon 
the workers and not allow labor movement at all. 
  In the past ten months of the so-called "civilian" rule of 
the traitor Kim Yong-sam the South Korean workers have clearly 
realized through their experiences that his "commitment" to 
building a "society where the laboring people are well-off" is 
sham and he is a friend of the exploiters, not of the workers. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam group tries to block the struggle of the 
workers by fascist crackdown, it will only precipitate the 
destruction of the "civilian government."

  [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of 
the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
released its Information No. 640 on December 29 denouncing the 
Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's treacheries against the nation in 
the nearly one year since it came to power. 
  The information cited facts exposing that since it seized 
power the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has committed despicable 
treacheries against the nation, doing harm to and bartering away 
the national interests by resorting to humiliating sycophant, 
traitorous acts, "civilian" fascist dictatorship, reckless war 
moves and malicious anti-North confrontation racket. 
  It says in part: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam, a puppet, in his "summit talks" 
with the United States and at the South Korea-U.S. "annual 
Security Consultative Meeting" in July and November offered to 
pay more than 3,000 million dollars for the maintenance of the 
U.S. Forces present in South Korea, begging for their permanent 
presence in South Korea, and had the planned U.S. troop cutback 
in South Korea shelved. 
  During his visit to the United States in November he begged 
his master to "exercise strong influence", raising a hue and cry 
over the "suspicion of North's nuclear development", a 
fictitious talk. And, in a bid to put the brake on the progress 
of the DPRK-U.S. talks, he entreated his master to object to the 
North-proposed formula of package solution of the nuclear 
problem and establish an "international cooperation system" 
aimed at stifling the same fellow countrymen, and promised in 
privacy to open in return for it the South Korean rice market, a 
matter which even his preceding dictators didn't dare to deal 
with. 
  Further still, the traitor invited the Japanese prime 
minister to South Korea in early November and asked for "joint 
action" against the North's "nuclear problem" till its solution. 
He blared that South Korea and Japan should "develop their 
relationship into future-oriented one", whitewashing the 
thrice-cursed brutalities committed by the Japanese imperialists 
against the Korean people in the past. 
  Since it took the helm of power the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique has zealously followed the anti-socialist moves of the 
international reactionaries to stifle the DPRK. 
  Taking office, the traitor Kim Yong-sam made quite a noise 
as 
if he would bring about any "change" in the relations between 
the North and the South, saying "relations with the North would 
be improved from the viewpoint of the same nation". But it was 
a mere deception designed to mislead public opinion at home and 
abroad. 
  His criminal records reveal to the whole world that he has 
committed heinous crimes in bringing dark clouds of war over the 
head of the nation and driving the North-South relations to the 
worst phase.

<F P=106> ["Anti-DPRK Policy Revealed Again"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- Japanese Foreign 
Minister Hata reportedly told a press conference that "suspected 
nuclear programme of North Korea is a factor of destability in 
Asia as a whole." 
  In view of Hata's slanderous remarks against the DPRK in his 
first official appearance in the new year, it is not hard to 
predict that the anti-DPRK policy of the Japanese reactionaries 
will get more hostile this year. 
  The continued provocative utterances of the Japanese 
authorities against the DPRK show that they still seek a 
sinister purpose of isolating and stifling the DPRK in 
conspirary with seditious forces, far from atoning for the 
immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings they imposed on the 
Korean people in the past and establishing good-neighbourly 
relations with the DPRK. 
  Lurking behind their persistent outcries over the "suspected 
nuclear programme", a fiction, is a heinous intention to divert 
elsewhere the world's attention to Japan's stockpile of much 
plutonium and its scheme of nuclear arms development and build 
Japan into a nuclear power under the pretext of the suspicion 
and, further, stage a comeback to Korea. 
  They overtly revealed time and again their ambition for 
reinvading Korea by force of arms, defining the DPRK as "number 
one potential enemy." Judging from this fact, the Japanese 
reactionaries' acts are very ill-boding and their hostile acts 
on the springboard for overseas aggression and aggrandizement 
are very grave. 
  Their attempt to contain the DPRK with "strength" is a 
futile 
dream. 
  They must look straight at the trend of the times and act 
with discretion.

<F P=106> ["Anachronistic Policy of Strength" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- Charles Larson, 
commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Forces, recently tried to 
justify the U.S. nuclear umbrella and military bases in South 
Korea and Japan, claiming that continued U.S. military presence 
and meddling in the Asia-Pacific Region is needed. 
  NODONG SINMUN today says this revealed the intention of the 
U.S. bellicose quarters to dominate and control this region by 
perpetuating the U.S. military presence there and intensifying 
military intervention in those countries which follow the road 
of independence. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The United States is reinforcing military forces in 
Northeast 
Asia, especially in South Korea, to control the Asia-Pacific 
Region. It is obvious that Larson had in mind the provocation of 
war on the Korean peninsula when preaching the need of the U.S. 
military presence and meddling in the region. 
  The bellicose quarters of the United States openly reveal 
their intention to make a military adventure against the DPRK. 
  The U.S. military is examining the deployment of U.S. 
nuclear 
submarines and unmanned spy planes around the Korean peninsula 
and scheming to build a "theatre missile defence system" 
together with Japan under the pretext of coping with the 
"nuclear and missile threat" from the DPRK. 
  This move shows that the U.S. bellicose quarters have not 
yet 
given up their ulterior intention to impede the DPRK-USA talks 
and stifle the DPRK with strength. 
  If they think military threat and pressure can work on the 
Korean people, it is a miscalculation. 
  They must renounce the anachronistic ambition for dominating 
the Asia-Pacific Region and stop the anti-DPRK campaign.

  [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- The U.S. 
imperialists have committed aerial espionages against the 
northern half of Korea on more than 200 occasions in December by 
intensively mobilizing various reconnaissance planes such as 
U-2, RC-135, E-3, Rf-4C, RV-1 and EH-60, according to military 
sources. 
  On December 29, an overseas-based strategic reconnaissance 
plane RC-135 flew into the sky above Sokcho and committed aerial 
photographing and electronic reconnaissance on the whole areas 
of the northern half of Korea while making a shuttle flight from 
the East to the West. 
  Aerial espionages by this strategic reconnaissance plane 
numbered over ten cases in December.

  "The Cuban people have firmly defended the independence and 
sovereignty of the country and the gains of the revolution, 
repulsing the aggression, interference and blockade of the 
imperialists under the leadership of the Communist Party of Cuba 
headed by you over the past 35 years since the victory of the 
revolution. 
  "Today the Cuban people are vigorously advancing along the 
road of socialism, invariably adhering to the principle of the 
revolution under the complicated and acute international 
circumstances. We highly estimate this. 
  "I take this opportunity of sincerely wishing you and your 
people greater success in the struggle to defend the country, 
the revolution and socialism and achieve an independent 
development of the country and its prosperity. 
  "The friendship between the Korean and Cuban peoples is a 
solid friendship which was forged and has been developed 
constantly through a common struggle for sovereignty, 
independence and socialism. 
  "I am convinced that the traditional relations of friendship 
and cooperation between our two parties, two countries and two 
peoples will grow stronger."

  [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
observes the 35th anniversary of the victory of the Cuban 
revolution. 
  Noting that the victory of the Cuban revolution was an 
epoch-making event that terminated domination and subjugation, 
backwardness and poverty on the land of Cuba and opened a way of 
socialism guaranteeing sovereignty and independence, creation 
and prosperity, the editorial article says: 
  The 35 years covered by the Cuban people after the victory 
of 
the revolution have been a course of constant confrontation and 
struggle with the imperialist reactionaries and days in which 
they decorated their history with creation and innovation. The 
socialist changes and the victorious progress of the revolution 
in those years clearly indicate that no force on earth can block 
the road of socialism of the heroic Cuban people. 
  The Korean people note with high appreciation that the Cuban 
people are defending the country's sovereignty and national 
dignity and accelerating socialist construction, not yielding to 
any adversity. 
  The militant comradeship and unity between the peoples of 
Korea and Cuba have been further consolidated and developed in 
the course of overcoming trials together and struggling hand in 
hand for the common cause. 
  Friendship and unity between Korea and Cuba are an excellent 
model of comradely relations between the peoples of 
revolutionary countries. 
  The Korean people will, in the future, too, make every 
possible effort to strengthen and fully develop their friendship 
and unity with the Cuban people. 
  The just cause of the Cuban people will certainly end in 
victory.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- Officials of seven 
political parties and organisations including the president of 
the Pakistan Socialist Party and the president of the Pakistan 
Federation of Trade Unions, released a joint statement on 
December 22 in denunciation of the U.S. nuclear threat to Korea. 
  The statement stresses that the provocative menace and 
blackmail posed by the United States against the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea under the pretext of its "nuclear 
issue" are a violation of and threat to national sovereignty and 
security, which is an act quite contrary to the United Nations 
Charter. 
  It expresses full support to the DPRK's stand on the 
negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue and calls upon the 
people of the United States and the world to show a positive 
response to it. 
  The Ugandan National Executive Committee of the Seventh 
Pan-African Congress in a statement issued on the same day 
charges that paying no head to the nuclear arms deployed in 
Europe and Israel and other places, the United States is taking 
issue with North Korea which is using nuclear facilities for a 
peaceful purpose, and maneuvering to remove them. 
  The statement calls upon the world progressive people to 
decisively check such brigandish and aggressive act of the 
United States.

<F P=106> [Press statement issued by Pak Song-chol, member of the WPK </F>
Central Committee Political Bureau and vice president, on 3 
January; place not given] 
  [Text] Comrade Pak Song-chol, member of the Political 
Bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee 
and vice president of the DPRK, yesterday issued a press 
statement supporting the fatherland's reunification formula 
expounded by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New 
Year's address. 
  The press statement by Comrade Pak Song-chol, member of the 
WPK Central Committee Political Bureau and vice president of the 
DPRK says: 
  Our people--who embrace the historic New Year's address made 
by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song, the great sun 
of the nation and the lodestar of the fatherland's 
reunification, ringing in the hopeful New Year, 1994, with 
boundless gratitude and excitement--are filled with firm resolve 
and confidence to effect a new revolutionary upsurge in 
socialist construction and expedite the cause for reunifying the 
fatherland independently under the party's wise leadership in 
this year. 
  In his New Year's address, the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song, summing up last year, noted that the officers and men 
of our heroic People's Army and all the people, in hearty 
response to the party's militant call, stood up as one man in 
the struggle to brilliantly adorn last year's Third Seven-Year 
Plan and to defend the country's sovereignty and revolutionary 
achievements with an unshakable confidence in victory and in 
soaring spirits, foiled the enemy's challenge and aggressive 
scheme and honorably safeguarded the dignity and security of 
their socialist fatherland. 
  The great leader, in this year in which socialist 
construction enters a new stage of development, expounded the 
glorious tasks of consolidating and developing the achievements 
already made in the revolution and construction and achieving 
new and greater (?achievements) so as to further add luster to 
the popular masses-centered socialism of our own style. 
  In particular, touching on our party and the Republic 
government's sincere efforts made in the last year to open a way 
for the fatherland's reunification with the nation's united 
strength, the great leader clarified our party's principled 
position as regards to the fatherland's reunification. 
  Convinced that our party's principled position regarding the 
fatherland's reunification elucidated in the great leader's 
historic New Year's address is a programmatic guideline for 
breaking the deadlock lying in the way of the reunification and 
triumphantly accomplishing the cause for reunifying the 
fatherland with the nation's self-reliant force, I fervently 
support and welcome this. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: We must 
accomplish the cause of national reunification as soon as 
possible, so as to meet the unanimous, ardent desire of the 
entire nation and hand down the reunified country to our 
posterity. 
  Our nation was not only forced to experience the tragedy of 
separation by outside forces but also could not fulfill our 
nation's ardent aspiration to reunify the fatherland up until 
now due to the outside forces' stubborn maneuvers aimed at 
obstruction. 
  This shows that our country's reunification issue can only 
be resolved through our nation's own strength, rejecting the 
interference of outside forces, and that holding fast to the 
nation's principle of independence is a fundamental issue for 
the fatherland's reunification. Proceeding from this, we put 
forward a 10-point program of the great unity of the whole 
nation for the reunification of the fatherland last year and 
made all-out efforts to pave the road for reunification by means 
of unified strength and our nation's own strength. 
  The 10-point program set forth by the great leader is an 
immortal banner of the national unity to transcend differences 
in ideology, ideals, and systems, and a great charter for the 
reunification of the fatherland, which embodies the noble desire 
of our 70 million compatriots to realize the reunification and 
prosperity of our nation with a long history of 5,000 years. 
  We hoped the South Korean authorities would take the road of 
reconciliation and cooperation in response to our 10-point 
program of great national unity and, out of aspiration for 
national unity and reunification, we also took important steps 
for an exchange of top-level special envoys between the two 
sides. However, the South Korean authorities have clung to 
dependence on foreign forces, not national independence, and 
committed anti-national acts of further aggravating 
confrontation between the North and South, not national unity, 
by ignoring our magnanimous proposal and the desire of the 
entire nation for reunification. They have staged successive 
large-scale military exercises against our Republic frequently 
in collusion with foreign forces and have committed 
anti-republic maneuvers more viciously than their predecessors 
by clamoring for military countermeasures and an international 
cooperation system based on the pretext of our nonexistent 
nuclear issue. 
  Worse still, they suspended the North-South dialogues and 
exchanges, which had been pushed ahead even by the Fifth and 
Sixth Republics, and brutally suspended the patriotic forces for 
reunification. Last year, the new rulers of South Korea came 
out with a so-called step-by-step reunification [tangyejok 
tongil], which already had been at the nation's center of 
criticism, made the North-South relations retreat, and darkened 
the prospect for the reunification of the fatherland. 
  The current South Korean rulers, through their acts, clearly 
disclosed that the so-called civilian regime is only a disguise; 
in fact it does not differ from the successive military 
dictatorial regimes. Even though the current South Korean ruler 
loudly advertised civilian politics and reform policies, the 
National Security Law, the evil anti-communist fascist laws, and 
the Agency for National Security Planning and the Defense of 
Security command, which are suppressive agencies, still remain 
intact in South Korea. Due to the fascist politics dominated by 
public security, none of the desires of the South Korean people 
for independence, democracy, and national reunification has been 
fulfilled. 
  It is very natural that the South Korean people and figures 
in various classes and strata are waging an antigovernment 
struggle today, saying there is no need to further watch the 
current regime, and expect nothing from it. 
  Regarding our nuclear issue that the United States and its 
followers are talking about, the great leader taught in his New 
Year's address that the issue is a product of the antisocialist, 
anti-republic maneuver that the United States pursues 
persistently. 
  As the respected and beloved leader taught, it was the 
United 
States that raised the suspicion of nonexistent nuclear 
development of the North, and it is also the United States that 
threatens us after actually drawing nuclear weapons on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  Accordingly, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
should 
be resolved peacefully through negotiations between the 
offender, who poses the nuclear threat, and its victim, in other 
words, between our Republic and the United States. 
  Any pressure or threat will not work on us. To adhere to 
such a method cannot resolve the issue, but will only bring the 
grave result of driving the situation into a catastrophe 
[paguk]. The United States should take a good look at all the 
facts and act discreetly. Under the condition that the 
DPRK-U.S. joint declaration has been signed, the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula will be resolved fairly if both sides 
abide by and implement the principles agreed upon. 
  In his New Year's address, the great leader stressed that 
our 
Republic's principle and line for the fatherland's reunification 
never changes, and made it clear that we will make every effort 
to achieve the reunification of the country in a way of a 
confederal system based on one nation, one country, two systems, 
and two governments, according to the three principles of 
independence, peaceful reunification, and the great national 
unity. 
  This principled position clarified by the great leader 
clearly expresses the firm will of our party and the government 
of the Republic to hasten the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country in accordance with all the people's 
desire and intent, no matter how the situation develops. 
  As the great leader elucidated in his New Year's address, 
the 
principled position of our party and the government of the 
Republic regarding the fatherland's reunification, a brilliant 
road has indeed opened for us to vigorously accelerate the cause 
of the fatherland's reunification by overcoming difficulties in 
the course of reunification. 
  Our party and the government of the Republic will make every 
effort to realize the cause of fatherland's reunification in the 
nineties under the banner of the 10-point program of the great 
unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the 
fatherland presented by the great leader. It is the destiny of 
the fatherland, the nation, and all our people at home and 
abroad. 
  I fervently appeal to the 70 million compatriots in the 
North, the South, and overseas, who love the country and the 
nation, to launch vigorously into the nationwide struggle to 
realize the fatherland's reunification based on the confederal 
system, firmly united as one under the banner of the 10-point 
program of the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunification of the fatherland and upholding the policy on the 
fatherland's reunification that the great leader elucidated in 
his New Year's address. 
  I also expect the progressive people of the world, who value 
justice and peace, to completely support and encourage the 
Korean people's struggle for the country's reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- "The principled stand 
of the Workers' Party of Korea on national reunification 
indicated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in the 
historical New Year address is a highly important guideline 
whereby to overcome difficulties lying in the way of national 
reunification for the present and successfully pushing ahead 
with the cause of reunification with the internal force of the 
nation", declares Pak Song-chol, Politburo member of the Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and vice-president, in 
his statement Monday. 
  "The great leader in his New Year address elaborated on the 
sincere efforts made by our party and the government of the 
Republic to pave the way for national reunification by the 
united strength of the nation last year and reiterated the 
principled stand of our party on the reunification of the 
country," Pak says, and continues: 
  "In the New Year address the great leader stressed that the 
principle and the line of our party and the government of the 
Republic on national reunification remain unchanged, declaring 
that we will make every effort in the future, too, to reunify 
the country by a confederacy formula based on one nation, one 
state, two systems and two governments, on the three principles 
of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity. 
  "This principled stand clarified by the great leader clearly 
manifests the unshakable will of our party and the government of 
our Republic to bring an early realisation of the independent 
and peaceful reunification of the country in compliance with the 
desire and will of the whole nation in disregard of the change 
of the situation. 
  "Our party and the government of our Republic will make 
maximum efforts to accomplish the cause of national 
reunification in the 90s under the banner of the 10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation put forward by 
the great leader." 
  Pak earnestly calls upon the 70 million fellow countrymen in 
the North, South and overseas to courageously turn out in a 
nationwide struggle for reunifying the country by the 
confederacy formula, united as one under the banner of the 
10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation in 
hearty response to the policy of national reunification laid 
down by the great leader in the New Year address. 
  He expresses the expectation that the world progressives 
will 
extend full support to the Korean people in their struggle for 
the reunification of the country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- The New Year address 
of the great leader President Kim Il-song has evoked widespread 
repercussions upon the people. 
  Chang Si-pom, secretary of the party committee of the State 
Commission of Light Industry, said that the New Year address of 
the respected leader President Kim Il-song is a militant banner 
which indicates the path of leading the cause of socialism, the 
cause of chuche, from one victory to another under the 
fast-changing situation. 
  Noting that the New Year address powerfully inspired the 
party members and other officials of the commission responsible 
for the development of the nation's light industry, he said: 
"We will conduct the party work in a fresh and ambitious manner 
as demanded by the chuche-based theory and method of party work 
so as to make a positive contribution to carrying into a 
brilliant reality the far-reaching plans and intentions of 
President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il." 
  Kim Pong-chu, chairman of the Anak County, South Hwanghae 
Province, Cooperative Farm Management Committee, had this to say: 
  "The great leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year 
address put forward a militant task to consolidate the successes 
achieved in the irrigation and electrification of the rural 
areas, raise the level of mechanization and application of 
chemicals, implement the chuche farming method thoroughly and 
thus boost grain and all other agricultural production this 
year, a meaningful year which will mark the 30th anniversary of 
the publishing of the socialist rural theses. 
  "Our county will produce 50,000 more tons of grain than last 
year by cultivating crops as required by the chuche farming 
method." 
  Han Chang-kon, vice-chairman of the State Commission of the 
Electric Power Industry, said: 
  "It is a task before the officials and working people of our 
electric power industry to strongly support the party's 
strategic agriculture-first, light-industry-first and foreign 
trade-first policy with an increased production of power. 
  "We officials of power industry will launch a powerful 
production drive, giving precedence to the political work in 
accordance with the requirements of the Taean work system and 
thus make a better contribution to making the party's 
revolutionary economic strategy bear fine fruits."

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- Korea produced a 
cellulose albuminous fodder highly effective in economy. 
  The fodder, rich in protein, consists of different nutrients 
needed for accelerating the growth of livestocks. 
  Particularly, it contains more ferment, vitamin and other 
activated materials than other fodder. 
  The albuminous fodder increases the daily growing rate of 
pig 
or duck 20 percent higher than other fodder. 
  The quantity of fodder consumption is notably diminished and 
the rate of protein digestion rises by far. 
  The fodder is made from rice straw, cornhusk, corncob, 
sawdust and other cellulose materials by a diastatic method. 
  150 or 200 kilograms of albuminous fodder, 30 kilograms of 
microbial protein and some alcohol are obtained from one ton of 
cornhusk. 
  The cellulose albuminous fodder, which has been rapidly 
introduced in stockbreeding in Korea, was developed by the 
scientists and technicians of the protein synthesis section 
under the Institute of the Industrial Microbiology of the 
Academy of Sciences.

  [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- The confirmation of 
the 5,000 years long history of the Korean nation and its father 
through the unearthing of the Tomb of Tangun is a marvelous 
event that brilliantly adorned the first page of the nation's 
history which had long remained a blanket, says NODONG SINMUN in 
a by-lined article. 
  The article continues: 
  It was proved again that the Korean people with Tangun as 
their father are a homogeneous nation proud of having lived with 
the same blood, the same language and same cultural tradition 
for 5,000 years. This has further hardened the will of the 
fellow countrymen to put an end to the division of the country 
at an early date and live as the same nation in a unified 
country and also brightened the prospect of national 
reunification. 
  Only when all the Koreans in the North, South and overseas 
achieve great unity of the whole nation, irrespective of their 
ideology, idea, political view and religious belief, can our 
nation establish a unified state and live a harmonious life as 
it did before. 
  The situation prevailing in Korea raises to the fellow 
countrymen serious issues -- whether they will prolong the 
national division forced by outside forces and antagonize and 
confront with each other to fall a prey to outside forces or 
unite with each other to defend the dignity of the nation and 
pave the way of national reunification. 
  Under no circumstances we can make a choice to invite self- 
destruction through a fratricidal war and allow outside forces 
to profit therefrom. 
  It is the only choice for our nation to reunify the country 
with great national unity. And it is also the only way for 
coprosperity of the North and the South as the same nation. 
  The pride of the homogeneous nation that has been maintained 
for 5,000 years with Tangun as its father and the common desire 
of the nation for reunification -- this is a source for uniting 
the whole nation closely on the road of national reunification. 
  It is the unshakable will of the fellow countrymen that if 
they achieve great unity of the whole nation with the pride of 
the homogeneous nation, they would be quite able to repulse 
aggression and interference by outside forces, smash pressure by 
big powers and win national reunification in the '90s. 
  All the Koreans in the North, South and overseas will 
reunify 
the country through the establishment of a pan-national unified 
state, independent, peaceful and neutral, in the '90s, closely 
rallied under the banner of the 10-point programme of the great 
unity of the whole nation with the pride of the homogeneous 
nation, thus adding shine to the 5,000 years long history of 
Tangun Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- Great achievements 
have been reported from different sectors of the national 
economy in Korea in the new year. 
  The Kim Chaek iron and steel complex turned out much more 
molten iron than the assignment on the first day of the new 
year. Its furnacemen have increased the production of iron per 
charge 20 percent as against the previous, cutting the time of 
melting 30 minutes. 
  The Sangwon cement complex overfulfilled the first day's 
assignment by more than 20 percent by operating all the 
automated kilns and equipment in full capacity. 
  The Pyongyang and Pukchang thermal power complexes have kept 
all the equipment in full-capacity operation to effect a great 
upswing in power production. 
  The railway transport plan has also been overfulfilled from 
the first day. 
  The General Bureau of Western Railways surpassed by far its 
transport quotas. Over 10,000 more tons of freight were carried 
on the first day than the rated traction tonnage.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Indoctrination in the Chuche Idea Is an </F>
Indoctrination To Strengthen the Main Force of the Revolution"] 
  [Text] Our party's indoctrination in the chuche idea is 
basically aimed at strengthening the main force of the 
revolution. In other words, the indoctrination in the chuche 
idea, including indoctrination in the principle of the chuche 
idea, indoctrination in class character, indoctrination in the 
revolutionary tradition, indoctrination in party policies, and 
indoctrination in socialist patriotism, is an ideological 
indoctrination to strengthen the main force of the revolution by 
firmly arming our party members and working people with a 
chuche-oriented revolutionary view of the world. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: The 
basic 
purpose of the indoctrination in the chuche idea is, in a 
nutshell, to guarantee unity of ideological will in the 
revolutionary ranks by arming the popular masses, who are the 
main force of the revolution, with a revolutionary independence 
ideology and to lead the popular masses to maintain the position 
as masters and to play the role as masters in the revolution and 
construction. 
  Now, let us discuss why the indoctrination in the chuche 
idea 
is an indoctrination to strengthen the main force of the 
revolution. It is because the primary purpose of the 
indoctrination in the chuche idea is to guarantee unity of 
ideological will in the revolutionary ranks by arming the 
popular masses with a revolutionary independence ideology. The 
mission of the working class' party is to successfully push 
ahead with the revolution and construction and, thus, to 
completely realize independence of the working masses of people. 
In order to do this, it is imperative not only to achieve the 
cause of national liberation and class liberation, but also to 
consummate the cause of socialism and communism. For this end, 
it is necessary to have the inexhaustible strength capable of 
pushing ahead with and consummating these causes. The source of 
the inexhaustible strength lies in that all the people firmly 
unite around the party and the leader [suryong] with one 
ideological will. However, such unity does not come 
spontaneously. To achieve firm unity in the revolutionary ranks 
it is imperative to see to it that only one ideology prevails in 
the ranks. Only by doing so can unity of ideological will be 
achieved and great strength be displayed in the revolutionary 
ranks. 
  However, even though one ideology prevails in the 
revolutionary ranks, firm unity is not achieved spontaneously. 
Only the revolutionary ideology of the working class' leader 
[suryong], that is, the revolutionary ideology which most 
thoroughly and correctly reflects the independent demands and 
interests of the working masses of people, should prevail in the 
revolutionary ranks. The chuche idea is a revolutionary 
independence ideology, which most correctly and thoroughly 
reflects and has codified the independent demands and interests 
of the working masses of people. Therefore, there is no mightier 
ideology than the chuche idea in realizing unity and cohesion of 
the revolutionary ranks. The popular masses can firmly unite 
around the party and the leader [suryong] and display mighty 
strength only when they arm themselves with the chuche idea. 
Accordingly, guaranteeing unity of ideological will of the 
revolutionary ranks by firmly arming the popular masses with the 
revolutionary independence ideology is the primary purpose of 
our party's indoctrination in the chuche idea. 
  That the indoctrination in the chuche idea is an 
indoctrination to strengthen the main force of the revolution is 
also because the primary purpose of the indoctrination in the 
chuche idea leads the popular masses to maintain the position as 
masters of and to play the role as masters of the revolution and 
construction. The revolution is carried out by the working 
masses under the leadership of the party and the leader 
[suryong]. Therefore, to properly carry out the revolution and 
construction it is imperative for the popular masses to assume 
the attitude of being masters of the revolution and 
construction. The same may be said of the case of a household. 
Only when all members of the household, not only the housewife, 
manage household affairs with the position and attitude of being 
the housewife of the household can the household affairs be 
properly managed. Likewise, to successfully carry out the 
revolution and construction it is imperative for the popular 
masses, who are the people in charge of the revolution and 
construction, to thoroughly adhere to the position as masters 
and to smoothly play the role as masters. 
  To see to it that the popular masses maintain the position 
as 
masters in the revolution and construction and play the role as 
masters, it is imperative to strengthen among them ideological 
indoctrination work to enhance the awareness of being masters. 
The chuche idea demands that the popular masses have the 
attitude of being masters in the revolution and construction. 
When people firmly arm themselves with the chuche idea they can 
not only adhere to their independent and creative position, but 
also maintain the position as masters and display the role as 
masters in the revolution and construction. 
  In this way, leading the popular masses to have the attitude 
of being the master in the revolution and construction is not 
only the inherent demand of the revolutionary struggle itself, 
but also the inherent demand of the chuche idea. Herein lies the 
reason why the indoctrination in the chuche idea is an 
indoctrination to lead the popular masses to maintain their 
position as masters of and to play the role of masters of the 
revolution and construction. In this way, the indoctrination in 
the chuche idea, including indoctrination in the principles of 
the chuche idea, indoctrination in party policies, 
indoctrination in socialist patriotism, and indoctrination in 
class character, is the indoctrination to strengthen the main 
force of the revolution. 
  As the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has systematized 
scientifically and theoretically that the indoctrination in the 
chuche idea is an indoctrination to strengthen the main force of 
the revolution and has clearly elucidated the overall task and 
direction of ideological indoctrination work a guiding principle 
which makes it possible to further strengthen and develop 
ideological indoctrination work among party members and the 
working people has been provided.

  [Text] Narita, Chiba Pref., Jan. 4 KYODO -- Russia has 
imposed restrictions on flights over Siberia since late last 
year causing hefty delays for many Europe-bound passenger 
flights, Japanese aviation authorities said Tuesday [4 January]. 
Airlines are experiencing delays of over an hour to their 
scheduled departures from Narita Airport, the air gate to Tokyo 
some 70 kilometers to the east. 
  Two or three JAL flights a day are being delayed for more 
than an hour each day. JAL officials said they are resorting to 
emergency measures to ensure passengers are able to transfer to 
other flights at their destinations despite the delays. 
  Russia says the flight restrictions, sent as a formal 
"notice 
to airmen" on December 28, are a safety measure following a 
deterioration in the reliability of radio communications 
equipment and will last until March 27. The restrictions limit 
the number of civilian flights out of Japan and passing near 
Khabarovsk to a maximum of six per hour, one third of the 
previous frequency. 
  Between 40 and 50 flights use this route into and out of 
Narita each day but each must now await clearance from Russian 
authorities even if all passengers have boarded and they have 
completed departure procedures. 
  Aviation experts in Japan said the deterioration in the 
radio 
link could be due to cracking in equipment because of freezing.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 4 KYODO -- Myanmar [Burma] dissidents 
in Japan staged a rally in Tokyo on Tuesday [4 January], 
claiming that the people of Myanmar are not actually free or 
independent. They said independence day ceremonies being held 
in Yangon [Rangon] by the military junta are an empty display. 
  The rally against the junta, called the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council (SLORC), was organized by the International 
Network for Burma Relief, the Burma Youth Volunteer Association 
(BYVA) and the Burmese Relief Center-Japan, organizers said. 
  Not being allowed to pass directly in front of the Myanmar 
Embassy, human rights activists from various countries and 
Myanmar dissidents wound their way slowly through nearby 
streets. They marched in silence to symbolize Myanmar's lack of 
freedom of speech, said BYVA Chairman Khin Maung Zaw. 
  In a letter to Myanmar dissidents worldwide, Sein Win, prime 
minister of the National Coalition Government of the Union of 
Burma (NCGUB), said "on a sad note, I see Burma today not as an 
independent nation, but as a nation enslaved by the military." 
The NCGUB is made up of lawmakers elected in the 1990 elections 
who were forced to flee military persecution to the Thai border. 
  In a joint press release, the three groups requested that 
the 
United Nations and the international community, including the 
Japanese Government, use their influence to ask SLORC to 
transfer power to the democratically elected government. 
  They also asked for the release of Nobel peace prize winner 
Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners immediately 
and unconditionally.

  [Text] Otawara, Tochigi Pref., Jan. 2 KYODO -- Former 
Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe on Sunday [2 January] voiced 
opposition to dissolving the House of Representatives if 
political reform bills fail to be enacted before the January 29 
close of the current Diet session. 
  "There is no time for dissolution," said Watanabe, leader of 
the third largest faction in the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party, citing domestic economic factors. 
  "If (general) elections take place, Diet approval of the 
state budget for the next fiscal year would be in may, and pump 
priming measures will be postponed further." 
  Rather than concentrate now on the divisive issue of 
political reform, Watanabe again urged that four pending reform 
bills be carried over to the next regular Diet session, which 
convenes in late January. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on December 24 apologized 
to 
the public for failing to achieve political reform by his 
self-imposed yearend deadline, and vowed anew to pass the reform 
legislation by the time the current Diet session ends January 29. 
  A special political reform committee of the House of 
Councillors only began deliberations on the government's four 
political reform bills on December 24, 36 days after the House 
of Representatives passed the package. 
  Remarking on another contentious issue during a lecture here 
Sunday, Watanabe said the consumption tax should not be raised 
two or three years after a planned income tax cut is carried out. 
  Rather the consumption tax rate, now standing at 3 percent, 
should be raised once signs of economic recovery are evident, 
Watanabe said.

  [Text] Utsunomiya, Jan. 4 KYODO -- Former Foreign 
Minister Michio Watanabe denounced Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] co-leader Ichiro Ozawa on Tuesday [4 January] for 
plotting a "dictatorial" parliamentary strategy to force 
political reform bills through the Diet. Speaking at a lecture 
meeting in his home base of Tochigi Prefecture, Watanabe said 
the coalition government must not carry through Ozawa's alleged 
plan to "railroad" the package of four political and electoral 
reform bills through the Diet. 
  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) is a core party in the 
seven-party coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. Ozawa is widely regarded as a chief strategist for 
the coalition which swept Hosokawa to power last August. 
  "It is a dictatorial plan advanced by Shinseito to try to 
railroad the bills through the Diet on the strength of a 
majority vote," Watanabe said. 
  Watanabe is the leader of one of four major factions within 
the Liberal Democratic Party which fell to the opposition last 
year after 38 years of rule.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 4 KYODO -- The ruling coalition said 
Tuesday [4 January] it will try to complete debate on political 
reform at a House of Councillors special committee January 14 
even if the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
boycotts the session. 
  Senior officials of the seven-party coalition reached the 
consensus at a meeting in a Diet building after Shoji Motooka, 
chairman of the upper house panel on political reform, decided 
to resume discussion on the government's reform package 
Wednesday. 
  Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic 
Party 
who moderated the meeting, told a news conference he hopes the 
LDP will participate in the committee debate but said the 
coalition would go ahead with reform discussion without the LDP. 
  At a meeting of governing and opposition directors of the 
upper house panel, the LDP objected to the coalition's call for 
Wednesday's resumption of deliberations on the reform bills but 
Motooka decided to reopen panel business to speed up the 
long-delayed debate, Diet officials said. 
  The government reform package cleared the House of 
Representatives in mid-November but deliberations in the upper 
house stalled for over a month through late December due partly 
to the LDP's refusal to attend the reform panel session. Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political future on 
enactment of the reform package in the current extraordinary 
Diet session, which ends January 29.

  [Text] Ise, Mie Pref., Jan. 4 KYODO -- Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa pledged Tuesday [4 January] to enact political 
reform bills by the end of the current Diet session ending 
January 29, denying dissolution of the House of Representatives. 
"I do not have a thought at all of (Diet) dissolution or of 
resignation of the cabinet en masse," Hosokawa said at a news 
conference after a visit to Ise Shrine, an annual ritual for an 
incumbent premier. 
  Speculation has arisen that Hosokawa may dissolve the Diet 
or 
resign with other cabinet members if the political reform 
package fails to pass the House of Councillors during the 
session. Hosokawa has staked his political future on getting 
the political reform package into law, at first by the end of 
last year, and now by the end of the session which has been 
extended by 45 days. 
  The four government-proposed bills, which passed the lower 
house on November 18, are now pending in the upper house. 
  The prime minister also told reporters that he is willing to 
have further negotiations about the bills with Yohei Kono, 
president of the major opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), if they will bear fruit, he said. 
  Hosokawa met Kono before the package passed the lower house, 
seeking concessions about the package, but they failed to reach 
an agreement. 
  Hosokawa also said the government will not give up the plan 
to complete the construction of a dam on the Nagara River in 
spite of objections from environmentalists. He said he hopes 
the dam will be completed during the next fiscal year beginning 
in April. 
  He said the nearly-completed dam will be built "cautiously," 
based on the outcome of a new environmental assessment promised 
in December by Construction Minister Kozo Igarashi. The dam 
project had caused an international uproar when an appeal made 
by Japanese environmentalists demanding a halt drew attention 
from foreign ecology groups. 
  Hosokawa said an advisory panel will be set up to discuss 
the overhauling of the nation's defense program, adopted in 
1976. Based on its advice, the government will decide on 
measures by the summer, before the ministries submit their 
preliminary requests for fiscal 1995 budget draft. 
  The measures to be taken will affect the budget, he said. 
  Defense Agency officials have envisioned a smaller Ground 
Self-Defense Force with enhanced mobility and information 
gathering capabilities in line with the post-Cold War situation. 
  Hosokawa said the government will submit a product liability 
bill to the next ordinary session of the Diet beginning January 
31. He also pledged efforts for the early enactment of a Public 
Information Act.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "NHK News" program] </F>
  [Excerpt] All ruling parties held their meetings of 
legislators today to decide to resume the deliberations on 
political reform bills tomorrow in the House of Councilors and 
affirm their plans to pass the bills during the current Diet 
session. 
  [Begin recording of Social Democratic Party of Japan 
Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama] The current Diet session has been extended to 
29 January this year. The political reform bills should be 
passed in the Diet by that date, and the most important task I 
will have to accomplish is to have the bills passed in the Diet. 
I believe it would be good if both ruling and opposition parties 
find areas of agreement in revising the bills when they 
deliberate them. The matters of principle, especially 
corporation contributions, on which the ruling parties agreed 
whey they formed the coalition government, cannot be subject to 
deals between ruling and opposition parties. [end recording] 
  In this way, Chairman Murayama indicated that his party 
would 
not go along with any call for revising the prohibition in the 
bills on the corporate contributions. 
  [Begin recording of Shinseito representative Tsutomu Hata] 
After concluding that if Japan's politics remain unchanged as it 
has been, Japan would be unable to fulfill its responsibility in 
the international community, we have decided to reform even the 
current electoral system as part of the political reform. Some 
are arguing, however, that priority must be given to the 
prevention of political corruption and stimulus measures. I 
think the argument is ridiculous and out of the question. [end 
recording] 
  [Begin recording of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa] 
I hope that this year, we will achieve our long-standing goal of 
carrying out political reform. This year, I will do my best and 
work hard while refraining from making rash remarks. [laughs] 
[end recording] 
  [Begin recording of Komeito Secretary General Yuichi 
Ichikawa] The opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is 
attempting to collapse the political reform by boycotting the

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 2 KYODO -- Shimizu Corp. gave 3 million 
yen in 1990 to then Construction Minister Yuji Otsuka to reward 
him for persuading a land owner to drop his objection to a 
large-scale redevelopment project in Tokyo, informed sources 
said Sunday [2 January]. 
  Former Shimizu Vice Chairman Hiroyuki Koyama gave the money 
to Otsuka in December 1990 after he persuaded a building lease 
company to drop its objection to the redevelopment of a 
5.9-hectare area in Tokyo's Nagatacho District, the sources said. 
  The lease company yielded to pressure from Otsuka, 64, whose 
Tokyo No. 1 constituency in the House of Representatives is home 
to the company, they said. 
  Shimizu, which won a consulting contract with nine corporate 
land owners in the area, had to secure the consent of the 
building lease company, which owned land inside the area covered 
by the redevelopment project. 
  The redevelopment project received official authorization 
from the Tokyo metropolitan government in April 1993. The 
project will be completed around 2000. 
  After Otsuka managed to persuade the company to drop its 
objection, Koyama delivered the 3 million yen to Otsuka, the 
sources said. 
  Koyama was indicted last October on charges of giving a 10 
million yen bribe to former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi to 
secure public works contracts. 
  Otsuka's political office declined to comment on the 
allegation. Otsuka, who served as construction minister from 
December 1990 to November 1991 in the Cabinet of then Prime 
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, lost his Diet seat in last July's 
general election. 
  A Shimizu Corp. executive in charge of the project told 
KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE, "our company has not submitted any request to 
former Construction Minister Otsuka in connection with the 
project, although we have donated a small amount to him in the 
annual summer and year-end gift-giving seasons."

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 0000 GMT on 3 January, as part of its 60-minute "New 
Year Interview Program With the Heads of the Opposition 
Parties," carries a 40-minute recorded interview with Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei Kono by NHK commentator 
Takashi Yamamoto and NHK announcer Atsuko Yamada at the NHK 
studios. The interview was recorded on 29 December. 
  At 0001 GMT, Yamamoto begins interviewing LDP President Kono 
by asking his evaluation of the Hosokawa government. Kono 
states: "The people warmly welcomed the Hosokawa government, 
which replaced the LDP, a party which had been in power for a 
long time. But when I think about the Hosokawa government's 
achievements, there have been no admirable political 
achievements." Asked by Yamada why the LDP delayed 
deliberations of the political reform bills in the House of 
Councillors, Kono replies: "During the past month, the LDP 
joined Diet deliberations on the supplementary budget for fiscal 
1993. As for the political reform bills, deliberations were 
also conducted in both the Political Reform Committee and the 
plenary session of the House of Councillors. I do not want the 
people to misunderstand." Asked by Yamamoto if his party makes 
no contentions about passing the political reform bills during 
the current Diet session, Kono says: "No, our party strongly 
hopes to put an end to the issue of political reform. Frankly 
speaking, if we should carry over this issue to the next 
ordinary Diet session, it will be difficult to settle the other 
issues which have to be solved. Therefore, I hope to conclude 
the issue of political reform during the current extraordinary 
Diet session." He then stresses that the ruling parties should 
make concessions to have the political reform bills passed. He 
also explains major points of difference between the ruling 
parties and the LDP on political reform. 
  Asked by Yamamoto if Prime Minister Hosokawa should hold 
himself responsible if he fails to have the political reform 
bills passed during the current Diet session, Kono states: "In 
a press conference, he apologized for failing to carry out 
political reform. But as you know, Hosokawa also pledged to the 
Diet that he would pass the bills by the end of 1993. He needs 
to make clear to the Diet whether he will take responsibility. 
Our party plans to take up this issue at the Budget Committee 
session early in the new year." Asked if the LDP plans to call 
for the resignation of the cabinet en masse, Kono replies: "We 
first need to hear his present state of mind." As regards the 
possible dissolution of the House of Representatives, Kono 
notes: "We are not in the position to refer to the dissolution 
of the House of Representatives because the right to dissolve 
the Diet is held by the prime minister. But we are in a 
situation wherein the government is required to give priority to 
protecting the people's living. When I think of the current 
economic condition, I find the people are in a serious economic 
situation. What politicians have to do first is to protect the 
people's standards of living. However, if the prime minister, 
who has the power to dissolve the Diet, should decide to 
dissolve the House of Representatives, we cannot do anything 
about it." In this way, Kono indicates the party is ready to 
accept the prime minister's challenge. 
  Asked if he intends to hold talks with Prime Minister 
Hosokawa to narrow gaps between the ruling parties and the LDP 
on political reform, Kono responds in the negative, saying 
holding such talks will devalue the importance of Diet 
deliberations. 
  Yamada discusses economic issues, asking Kono to comment on 
the Hosokawa government's economic policy. Kono replies the 
government lacks a sense of crisis about the current economic 
situation, saying: "We are in the worst economic condition 
since the end of the war, and I don't think the government's 
coming economic measures based on past experiences will help 
overcome the situation." Asked by Yamamoto how he views the 
idea of cutting the income tax in order to boost the economy, 
Kono stresses that the 10 trillion-yen in income tax cuts is 
necessary, adding "other stimulus measures also have to be 
taken." As regards the issue of how to secure revenue sources 
to make up for a fiscal budget shortfall resulting from the 
income tax decrease, Kono says: "Raising the consumption tax 
will not help boost the economy. What is most important for us 
is to restore the economy." Yamamoto then asks Kono: "Do you 
think the government should boost the economy even by issuing 
deficit-covering bonds?" Kono answers: "Yes." 
  Yamamoto turns the subject to reform of the LDP. Asked how 
he would change the LDP, Kono says underlying the party's loss 
of power is the people's distrust of the LDP's money-power 
politics; he intends to regain the people's confidence. Asked 
about a move toward realigning the political parties, Kono rules 
out a possible split in the LDP. 
  The interview ends at 0040 GMT.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 4 KYODO -- Five House of 
Representatives members who recently bolted from the major 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) formed a new group 
Tuesday in the lower house, a group member said. 
  Takeo Nishioka, head of the group, told reporters they will 
cooperate with the coalition government led by Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa to enact the political reform bills now 
pending in the House of Councillors and to implement measures to 
stimulate the sluggish economy. 
  Nishioka also said he will ask upper house members to join 
his force, noting there still are many pro-reform lawmakers in 
the LDP. The group is called Kaikakunokai (Reform Group). 
  The five members are Nishioka, former chairman of the LDP's 
Policy Affairs Research Council and a former education minister, 
Kunio Hatoyama, another former education minister, Shigeru 
Ishiba, Masamitsu Oishi and Takashi Sasagawa. 
  Hatoyama left the LDP and became independent in June last 
year and the other four did so in December. Last year, more 
than 50 Diet members left the party, which surrendered its 
38-year-old grip on power in August. 
  The four who quit in December defied the LDP's boycott to 
vote with the ruling coalition to extend the Diet session for 
another 45 days beyond the December 15 deadline. The coalition 
government wants the extension to enable it to enact political 
reform bills which Hosokawa had vowed to make law by the 
year-end. 
  The LDP now has 222 members in the 511-seat lower house. 
  Of the seven ruling parties, the Social Democratic Party has 
76 seats, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 61, Sakigake 
[Harbinger] and the Japan New Party a combined 53, Komeito 52, 
and the Democratic Socialist Party 19. The Japanese Communist 
Party has 15 seats, the new group five, and independents eight.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 4 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister 
Sosuke Uno said in a New Year interview that he is not confident 
that the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will soon be 
able to regain the reigns of power. Uno, who served as Japan's 
prime minister for three months through early August 1989, also 
told KYODO NEWS SERVICE he considers it unlikely that the LDP 
will splinter any further. 
  Uno said he is not optimistic about an early LDP comeback 
because "the ballots cast by the people are not really so 
ambiguous." Noting that the LDP would need to win back over 30 
seats in order to obtain a majority in the House of 
Representatives, he said, "it will probably be difficult to 
regain them in the next election." 
  He said that while it cannot be helped if a small number of 
parliamentarians leave the party, "I want to tell them: `don't 
do anything funny.' The LDP has lots of flaws, but they can't 
be fixed in one fell swoop. Everyone must chime in to fix them."

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 3 KYODO -- The government has begun to 
study the possibility of implementing income and residential tax 
cuts worth 7 trillion yen as part of new pump-priming measures, 
the MAINICHI SHIMBUN reported Monday. 
  This is in response to a protracted recession and rising 
calls for greater income tax cuts from ruling coalition and 
opposition parties, the mass-circulation daily said. 
  The government also intends to carry out the tax reductions 
two years ahead of a hike in the 3 percent consumption tax, it 
said, quoting government sources. 
  The sources were also quoted as saying the government is 
taking account of talks between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton scheduled for February 
11 in Washington. 
  At the talks, the United States is expected to urge Japan to 
whittle down its huge trade surplus by boosting domestic demand, 
the daily said. 
  The government is coordinating views within the ruling 
parties to implement more than 6 trillion yen worth of income 
and residential tax cuts while the finance ministry has 
expressed its intention of raising the consumption tax from 3 
percent to 7 percent from April 1995. 
  The opposition Liberal Democratic Party, however, is seeking 
10 trillion yen worth of such tax reductions. 
  Moreover, some members of Shinseito [Japan Reneewal Party], 
the second-largest of the ruling coalition parties, are also 
calling for 10 trillion yen worth of tax cuts while the Social 
Democratic Party, the largest of coalition parties, is opposed 
to the consumption tax hike.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 4 KYODO -- Japan's 11 major commercial 
banks hold 6.7 trillion yen more in nonperforming loans than 
they have disclosed, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported Tuesday. If 
the undiclosed amount is included, the combined sum of bad loans 
at the banks swells to 15,969 billion yen, the mass-circulation 
daily said. 
  Nonperforming loans are loans which have become 
uncollectible 
due to the bankruptcy of borrowers or upon which interest 
payments have not been made for six months or longer. The 11 
commercial banks had disclosed such loans worth 9,273 billion 
yen as of the end of September. 
  Among them, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank held 747 billion yen 
worth of undisclosed nonperforming loans, compared with its 
disclosed sum of 440 billion yen, the daily said. 
  The ratio of disclosed and undisclosed bad loans to the 
Sapporo-based bank's outstanding balance of lending stood at 15 
percent, or three times higher than the 11 commercial banks' 
average rate, it said.

  [Text] Fukushima, Jan. 4 KYODO -- Japan's top farming 
industry leader who has opposed the government's decision to 
partially open Japan's rice market said Tuesday he is resigning 
for health reasons. 
  Yoshiharu Sato, chairman of the Central Union of 
Agricultural 
Cooperatives (Zenchu), told reporters in this northern Japanese 
city that he expects to submit his resignation to the 
Tokyo-based organization on Thursday. 
  Sato, 68, has been in hospital for cancer treatment. He did 
not name a successor but said he hopes the new Zenchu leadership 
will work out a policy to deal with the opening of the rice 
market. 
  Sato, who became Zenchu's chief in July 1993, has criticized 
the government's decision to partially open the rice market as 
"totally unacceptable" for rice growers. 
  The decision last month by Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's 
government marked the end of Japan's half-century ban on rice 
imports. 
  Tokyo accepted a proposal made by the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which calls for Japan to open 4 
percent to 8 percent of its domestic rice market as the minimum 
access for imports, while giving a six-year moratorium for 
replacing all import restrictions with tariffs.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 31 KYODO -- Eleven major Japanese 
commercial banks, known as city banks, plan to eliminate a total 
10,000 jobs over three years from fiscal 1993 as part of 
streamlining efforts, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported Friday. 
  As part of the project, the banks will close more than 100 
branches and smaller outlets throughout the country during 
fiscal 1994, the leading business daily said. 
  The job reduction will be implemented mainly through a curb 
on employment of new graduates and transfer of employees to 
affiliates, it said. 
  Some of the 11 banks are considering paying extra retirement 
allowances to induce employees to quit, according to the 
newspaper. 
  The rationalization of bank operations has been prompted in 
large part by swollen bad assets due to the collapse of the 
bubble economy, it said. 
  The 11 major commercial banks are forecast to liquidate more 
than 2 trillion yen worth of such assets in the current fiscal 
year, ending next March 31.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 4 KYODO -- Business leaders sent 
strong messages to their employees Tuesday [4 January] on the 
first day of work this year calling for increased efforts to 
promote streamlining to overcome the lagging recession. 
  Takashi Imai, president of Nippon Steel Corp., called for 
rationalizing the operation of the headquarters, while Tsutomu 
Kanai, president of Hitachi Ltd., urged a comprehensive 
streamlining of the management for higher efficiency. 
  Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor Co., stated that 
the company will beef up overseas operations especially in the 
fast growing Asian nations, including China. 
  Tsuneo Wakai, president of Mitsubishi Bank, said financial 
institutions must carry out a drastic rationalization and 
improve efficiency so as to make it possible to write off the 
massive amount of bad loans. 
  "I ask you to seriously think about how you can make more 
money" was the word delivered to employees by Shunkichi Miyoshi, 
president of NKK Corp. 
  In connection with the ongoing deregulatory moves, Isao 
Nakauchi, president of Daiei Inc., said that in the long run he 
would like to see prices become half of what they are now 
through redressing the price difference between Japan and abroad. 
  Heads of companies that have been protected by various rules 
called for a change. 
  Hiroshi Araki, president of Tokyo Electric Power Co., said 
the electric power industry must seek its social role in times 
of transition, while Yasuyuki Wakahara, president of Asahi 
Mutual Life Insurance Co., alarmed workers about the changes 
that are about to take place in traditional rules and practices. 
  Meanwhile, there were a few, bullish remarks as well. 
  Hitoshi Kojima, president of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corp., told the audience he is confident that the communications 
industry will become the core industry in the world. 
  Seiji Fukatsu, president of All Nippon Airways Co., boasted 
that the airline industry is a growing business sector since 
there is a sufficient potential demand for traveling. 
  NEC Corp. President Tadahiro Sekimoto told his employees 
that 
restructuring efforts being tackled elsewhere is nothing new 
from what the company has already been strategically pursuing.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 4 KYODO -- The ratio of employees' 
combined income to the total national income hit a record high 
of 73.3 percent in fiscal 1992, up 2.3 percentage points from 
the previous year, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported Tuesday. 
The rise was the biggest in 18 years, the economic daily said. 
  Because of the prolonged recession, however, the income of 
salaried workers in Japan in the fiscal year ended March 31, 
1993, grew at a record low rate of 3.5 percent, down from a 7.5 
percent increase registered in the previous year, it said. 
  But the national income itself recorded the smallest growth 
ever of 0.3 percent, making the workers' share relatively 
higher, the newspaper said. 
  The higher ratio indicates that labor costs are heavier for 
corporations and so employees are likely to face tough 
resistance from their employers in the annual wage hike 
negotiations this spring, it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 31 KYODO -- Despite a wedding every 40 
seconds, fewer babies than ever were born in Japan in 1993 and a 
record number of couples ended up in divorces, the Health and 
Welfare Ministry said Friday [31 December]. 
  With 9.6 babies born per thousand people the birth rate hit 
a 
historic low. The number of births fell by 24,000 to 1.19 
million, sinking below the 1.2 million mark for the first time, 
the ministry said in announcing the estimate for this year. 
  The statistics were projected for the whole calendar year 
based on the number of births, deaths, marriages, and divorces 
registered between January 1 and October 31. 
  The low birth rate is expected to further reduce the 
fertility rate, which represents the average number of children 
a woman gives birth to in her life, from its all-time low last 
year of 1.5 children, officials said. To maintain the current 
population over the long run the rate must be 2.1 or above. 
  Apparently sparked by the June wedding between Crown Prince 
Naruhito and Masako Owada, 38,000 more couples tied the knot 
than in 1992. The number of marriages has been continuously on 
the rise over the last six years, reaching 792,000 in 1993. 
  The wedding fever was especially strong in June, which saw 
an 
increase by 10,000 marriages over last year. On June 9 alone, 
the day of the royal wedding, 13,000 couples started married 
life. However, the country also experienced a second divorce 
boom following a first peak in 1983. After a continued rise 
over the last three years, divorces peaked at 189,000, an 
all-time high. Some 10,000 more couples decided to separate than 
last year, amounting to a divorce every 2 minutes 47 seconds. 
  While births still outstripped deaths, the natural 
population 
increase further slowed to an all-time low 302,000 people, 
50,000 less than in 1992. Partly due to an influenza epidemic 
in January and February, deaths soared by 26,000 to a record 
883,000. 
  As to the causes of death, cancer ranked top with 237,000 
cases, followed by 183,000 deaths resulting from heart diseases, 
and some 120,000 people dying from cerebrovascular diseases. 
The pattern remained unchanged since 1985.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- With the United States 
and North Korea reportedly nearing agreement on the North Korean 
nuclear question, South Korean Government officials have begun 
to work out measures on the assumption that the issue will be 
resolved soon. 
  The Foreign Ministry, which handles the North Korean nuclear 
problem, is said to expect that Washington and Pyongyang will 
hold another working-level contact in New York this week to wrap 
up their negotiations. 
  But ministry officials are taking the cautious approach as a 
last-minute glitch could develop in the U.S.-North Korean talks 
with a change in the ever unpredictable North Korean attitude. 
  The Seoul Government began to undertake preparations for a 
working-level contact with North Korea for exchanges of special 
envoys, if and when the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) is able to send its inspection team to Pyongyang, 
following negotiations between the IAEA and North Korea. 
  The government will work on plans for future inter-Korean 
ties, anticipating improvement in North Korea's relations with 
the United States and Japan in the event that the North Korean 
nuclear issue is resolved in the first half of this year. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Monday that his ministry 
will map out diplomatic countermeasures because there is a 
strong possibility that North Korea could improve its ties with 
the United States and Japan this year. 
  The South Korean Government has said it would not oppose any 
improvement of relations between North Korea and the United 
States or Japan, but Seoul has, in actuality, coolly reacted to 
any such moves by its traditional allies, according to ministry 
insiders. 
  The latest, prevailing way of thinking among Foreign 
Ministry 
officials is that Seoul has to work out a policy and 
consistently follow it since relations between Washington and 
Pyongyang could improve at an accelerating pace once the nuclear 
issue is cleared up at a third round of their high-level talks. 
  Over at the National Unification Board [NUB], meanwhile, 
officials believe chances are great that the United States and 
North Korea will reach a complete agreement. Accordingly, they 
are preparing for conditions that Seoul could table at a 
working-level inter-Korean contact. 
  But NUB officials are also "extremely careful" in their 
approach because there always is a chance that the North Koreans 
could throw a wrench in their negotiations at the last minute. 
  Some of the most serious problems that, NUB officials 
believe, could come up in the inter-Korean working-level contact 
could be the purpose of the exchanges of special emissaries. 
  The exchanges of special envoys have been discussed both by 
South and North Korea. But it has not precisely been defined 
what they will discuss once the proposed exchanges take place. 
  One of the main topics South Korea wants them to discuss is 
simultaneous and mutual inspection of nuclear facilities. 
  But the NUB officials expect that North Korea could very 
well 
counter their proposal with President Kim Il-song's so-called 
10-point program that calls, among other things, for unification 
through federal system in which two Koreas have one state but 
two governments. 
  There indeed are difference of views on the nature of 
mission 
of the special envoys, one NUB official admits. But North 
Korea, nevertheless, recognizes the need for exchanging special 
envoys, if only because it wants to realize the third round of 
high-level talks with the United States, he said. 
  There is a strong possibility that South and North Korea 
could stand far apart even when they agreed to exchange special 
envoys. 
  That is part of the reason NUB officials are at pains to 
provide viable proposals for simultaneous inspections between 
the South and North that could be supplementary to IAEA 
inspections, he added.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu] </F>
  [Text] Many changes took place last year at home and 
abroad. At home the civilian-led government was inaugurated and 
new policies and reform were promoted. Internationally, 
important changes and progress also continued. 
  In particular, as part of the international society, our 
country's position and role were newly established. I also 
believe it was a year in which we were able to feel skin-deep 
our international responsibility. 
  Our government established a broad and future-oriented 
diplomatic line of the so-called "new diplomacy," and promoted 
various diplomatic policies according to it. In the past, our 
diplomacy concentrated only on survival and security. However, 
our diplomacy deviated from it and is now unfolding our 
diplomacy so that we can actively take part in matters of 
interest and concern to the world and resolving international 
issues as well as working for our welfare. President Kim 
Yong-sam's central role at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
[APEC] summit and the dispatch of our engineer corps for UN 
peacekeeping operations symbolically show our new diplomatic 
efforts. 
  It is important to view the international environment which 
we are faced with when we once again assess the direction of our 
diplomacy for the new year 1994. In a nutshell, while the world 
is becoming smaller it is moving toward a peaceful period but of 
fierce competition. 
  The world is becoming smaller because of developments in the 
technology of transportation and communication as well as the 
enhancement of mutual dependency among the countries. Now the 
world is literally becoming a global village, and it has become 
an era in which no country in this world can live without 
interchange with other countries. 
  After the end of the Cold War, international society was 
able 
to free itself from the fear of a great nuclear war which can 
destroy the whole world, thus making it possible for 
international society to all the more actively promote peace and 
reconciliation. Therefore, the interest of the countries are 
naturally leaning toward the development of the economy and 
society which gives priority to prosperity and welfare, rather 
than politics and security. As a result, competition among the 
countries in the field of economy and communications is becoming 
fiercer with each passing day, and an era of "unlimited 
competition" has emerged as the rules for competition has been 
laid down as a result of the Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations. 
  Amid this kind of international environment, we can view 
some 
essential points on what direction our diplomacy must move 
toward for 1994. First of all, we can now embody on a 
full-scale our "new diplomacy" which has established its frame. 
The five bases of the new diplomacy is globalization, 
diversification, pluralism, regional cooperation, and 
future-orientation. The reliability of the five bases is 
enhancing with the current international trend. Last year was 
the first year of the new diplomacy. We especially concentrated 
on globalization. I believe that 1994 will emerge as year in 
which regional cooperation and pluralism will be important tasks. 
  A few years ago the arrival of the Pacific era of the 21st 
century seemed only a figure of speech. However, with the rapid 
emergence of the Asia-Pacific region, it has now become a fait 
accompli. 
  The Asia-Pacific region's cooperation is approaching as our 
top priority. 
  The Asia-Pacific cooperative system made steady headway at 
the Seattle APEC summit. Our country is already playing an 
initiative role. Also, through the Indonesia APEC summit which 
is to take place this year, APEC will become our core diplomatic 
arena. Here we will pursue "open regionalism" and will continue 
efforts to strengthen cooperation on both sides of the Pacific. 
  The diplomacy of regional cooperation is important in the 
field of security. We will participate in the security dialogue 
which is being carried out centering on the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] and will actively participate in 
the "multi-faceted security dialogue of Northeast Asia" put 
forth by us. Countries in this region agree that an 
institutional device is necessary for cooperation in the 
security field of this region. When pending issues such as North 
Korea's nuclear issue is resolved can this kind of cooperation 
be accelerated. 
  Strengthening the economic and communications diplomacy is 
especially important in the process of diversifying the matter 
of interest and concern of our diplomacy. The World Trade 
Organization will be inaugurated as a result of the settlement 
of the UR. Here, we must concentrate our diplomatic strength 
and play an active role. This is a follow-up measure of the UR. 
In the process of dealing with various trade issues, our 
diplomacy in this field is important in reflecting our national 
interest to the utmost, but it is also necessary in preparing 
for possible international negotiations such as environmental 
issues in the future. 
  The economic diplomacy must also place emphasis on assisting 
the strengthening of our economy's international 
competitiveness. To achieve this we must actively use the 
economic cooperation dialogue organization established with the 
United States and Japan as a result of last year's summit 
diplomacy, and exert efforts in the diplomacy for exchange of 
science and technology and for cooperation in resources. 
  Amid the worldwide trend of openness, our diplomacy must 
play 
the role of being helpful in the internationalization of our 
overall society. Cultural diplomacy that can promote cultural 
and human exchanges with various countries and diplomacy to 
assist Koreans residing overseas are also important. In 
particular, since this year is "Visit Korea Year," this must be 
actively used not only in promoting our tourist business but 
also in cultural exchange and in internationalization. 
  In unfolding diplomacy according to this kind of direction, 
we must further strengthen relations with the four big powers as 
well as our allies and promote friendly cooperation will 
countries of all regions including Asia, America, Europe, the 
Middle East, and Africa. Also at time when the role of the 
United Nations is increasing, we must actively participate in 
the multifaceted diplomacy centering on the United Nations. We 
must actively assist and participate in international efforts to 
jointly deal with worldwide interests such as human rights, 
wiping out drugs, and assisting refugees. I believe that 
efforts on the government level as well as through private 
activities such as by the international cooperative group are 
important. 
  There are other pending issues that our diplomacy must 
resolve. A main example is North Korea's nuclear issue. North 
Korea's nuclear issue is the greatest barrier in promoting our 
future-oriented new reunification diplomacy. This must be 
urgently resolved for peace and security on the Korean peninsula 
as well as on the whole area of Northeast Asia. I hope that in 
the new year such South-North relations can be overcome so that 
we can move toward the road of peaceful co-existence and 
reunification. 
  Frequently people compare today's international situation on 
the Korean peninsula to the situation of the late Yi dynasty. 
If we can learn a lesson from history it will be that of not 
repeating our wrongdoings. We failed to make a wise selection 
at the crossroads of opening up and closing our doors to the 
outside world. We paid a dear price from the late 19th century 
to the early 20th century. We are faced with another selection 
with the opportunity of making a leap forward. We must wisely 
and courageously move toward openness and internationalization 
to choose a bright future for our nation.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter O Yong-hwan on the research report "The </F>
Environment for Reunification and North-South Relations," issued 
on 3 December by the Research Institute for National 
Reunification, affiliated with the National Unification Board 
(NUB)] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The World Situation </H5>
  The world order will further assume an aspect of 
multilateralism in 1994. Accordingly, it is expected that the 
United States will be in favor of the trends toward pluralism; 
that the regional powers' right of speech will be strengthened; 
and that the roles of international institutions and 
international organizations, including the United Nations, will 
be enhanced. 
  Powerful countries will constantly make efforts for 
disarmament, including cutting nuclear weapons. However, the 
regional arms race will be intensified, because uncertainty may 
take place as a result of the weakening of the influence of the 
United States and Russia. In this connection, the need for 
multilateral cooperation to cope with the issue concerning 
regional security will be raised. 
  In particular, because of the relative economic stagnation 
of 
the United States and the European Community (EC) and because of 
the rapid economic growth of the East Asian countries, the world 
order cannot but become more multilateral. 
  It is expected that the settlement of the Uruguay Round (UR) 
negotiations and the establishment of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) will promote the free trade system in the 
international economic order. 
  In addition, as the atmosphere for security and economic 
cooperation is heightened in international society, 
international concern and cooperation toward the environment, 
narcotics, and terrorism--the factors traditionally irrelevant 
to security--will be increased. 
  Accordingly, in order to stably manage the world's security, 
economy, and other factors traditionally irrelevant to security, 
international society's cooperation and the leadership of 
advanced countries, including the United States, will be more 
necessary. 
<H5>  The Situation of Northeast Asia </H5>
  The factors of constant tension--including the enhanced 
roles 
of Japan and China, the regional arms race, the instability of 
Russia, and the North Korean nuclear issue--exist in Northeast 
Asia. 
  However, the relations among the four powers in the region, 
which have been important in stabilizing the regional order, 
will be improved. Accordingly the atmosphere for cooperation 
among the four powers will be maintained. 
  In connection with the issue concerning security, it is 
expected that U.S.-Chinese relations, Japanese-Chinese 
relations, and U.S.-Japanese relations, which have become three 
pivots in maintaining the Northeast Asian order since the end of 
the Cold War, will be developed to promote cooperation. 
  In particular, because since September 1993, the United 
States has strengthened cooperation with China, including the 
revision of a hard-line policy against China and because China 
has also positively promoted the improvement of its relations 
the United States, there will be considerable progress in 
U.S.-Chinese relations this year. 
<H3>  The Atmosphere for Cooperation Among the Four Powers Will Be 
Maintained </H3>
  Taking into consideration the roles of the United States and 
China in Northeast Asia, the improvement of the relations 
between the two countries will have a positive influence on the 
stability of the regional situation. 
  It is expected that because of the settlement of the UR 
negotiations and because of the agreement on establishing the 
Trade and Investment Committee in the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC), economic exchange among the Northeastern 
Asian countries will be further expanded. 
  However, because the United States may put more 
market-opening pressure on regional countries which may enjoy 
great economic booms, trade friction between the United States 
and regional countries may take place. 
  It is expected that such an atmosphere in Northeast Asia 
will 
have a positive influence on the reunification environment 
rather than a negative influence. 
  The development of relations among the four powers--United 
States, Japan, China, and Russia--will contribute to resolving 
North Korea's nuclear issue and establishing peace in the 
region. The development of the relations among the four powers 
will play a positive role in leading North Korea to open its 
door. 
  The fact that the neighboring four powers are in favor of 
maintaining the present situation on the Korean peninsula while 
North Korea wants to resolve the issue concerning the Korean 
peninsula, including the nuclear issue, through negotiations 
with the United States rather than direct negotiations with the 
ROK, may be a stumbling block to improving North-South relations. 
<H5>  North Korea's Inner Situation </H5>
  Above all, it seems that in political domains, North Korea 
will constantly intensify the unity around the leader [suryong] 
and the implementation of the 10-point program of great unity of 
the whole nation. 
  To consolidate the system for Kim Chong-il's power 
succession, North Korea will constantly strengthen its 
idolization work for Kim Chong-il. Accordingly, there is a 
possibility that Kim Chong-il may be appointed chairman of the 
party military commission. 
  Internally, as to the issue concerning the 
agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first 
economic policies, North Korea may fully encourage farmers and 
workers to invigorate the stagnant economy. Externally, North 
Korea may promote a limited openness to induce foreign capital 
and technology. 
  At the same time, it is expected that to minimize a bad 
influence caused by the change of the neighboring environment, 
North Korea may fully hold rallies of all kinds of social 
organizations in a bid to strengthen internal social control. 
<H5>  The Strengthening of Internal Social Control </H5>
  However, because of the influx of overseas information 
through openness, social and economic deviation may be increased 
gradually in North Korea. 
  In the meantime, it is expected that regardless of economic 
stagnation, North Korea may adhere to a policy giving priority 
to the Army to strengthen Kim Chong-il's authority. 
<H5>  North Korea's External Relations </H5>
  Based on their traditional friendly relations, North Korea 
and China will continue to strengthen political relations, 
economic exchange and cooperation, and military exchange. 
However, to promote sustained economic development, China may 
seek to change benefactor-type relations based on ideology into 
give-and-take cooperative relations. 
  North Korean-U.S. relations will depend upon the progress in 
the negotiations over North Korea's nuclear issue. Taking into 
consideration the two sides' will to avoid catastrophe, North 
Korean-U.S. relations may be positively developed. 
  Accordingly, it seems that North Korea and the United States 
may discuss the issue of enhancing the dialogue level according 
to the holding of the third round of the North Korean-U.S. 
high-level talks, the issue of promoting economic cooperation, 
and the issue of expanding the exchange of people. 
  The rapid development of North Korean-Russian relations may 
be difficult. However, according to Russia's policy based on 
actual interest, the economic exchanges between the two 
countries will be improved gradually. At the same time, 
regardless of the readjustment of the military allied relations, 
military exchange and cooperation will be maintained between 
North Korea and Russia. 
  North Korean-Japanese relations will be improved politically 
and economically both. 
  In particular, it seems that the North Korean-Japanese 
negotiations to establish diplomatic relations, which have been 
brought to a deadlock since the eighth round of the talks, will 
be resumed. Accordingly, the economic exchange between the two 
countries may become actually brisk. 
<H5>  North Korea's Strategy Toward the South </H5>
  This year, there may be not a considerable change in North 
Korea's strategy toward the South, including its existing policy 
on the theory of excluding the South Korean Government and its 
reunification tactics. 
  Accordingly, North Korea will denounce the South Korean 
Government by using various propaganda means and will constantly 
agitate the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification, 
the National Alliance of Youths and Students for the Country's 
Reunification, and the Alliance for the ROK Youths. However, 
because the ROK movement circles have been weakened since the 
civilian government was launched, because the United States and 
Japan have put pressure on North Korea to resume North-South 
dialogue, and because the neighboring environment has changed, 
North Korea may attempt to change its tactics while adhering to 
its basic strategy of revolutionizing the South. 
  In other words, as a tactic for holding the third round of 
the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, North Korea may propose 
that "the pannational council for forming a reunified state" in 
which the South Korean Government and other figures of all 
strata participate be formed. 
  In addition, it is highly likely that as a tactic for 
demonstrating its legitimacy, North Korea may propose that "a 
scholastic fact-finding team for King Tangun," in which the 
South Korean Government figures and other figures from all 
strata participate, be formed. 
<H5>  North-South Relations </H5>
  Above all, it seems that even though a point of compromise 
may be found through North Korea's acceptance of the ad hoc 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 
1994, the stage for ensuring the transparency of the nuclear 
issue will not be reached. 
  Accordingly, it is highly likely that North Korea's nuclear 
issue will be a stumbling block to improving North-South 
relations this year. 
  As to North-South dialogue, various issues which have been 
caused by the North Korean systems unrest, the nuclear issue, 
and the North's hard-line policy toward the South, may make it 
difficult to reach a point for North-South reconciliation. 
  In connection with North-South dialogue, in case North Korea 
accepts the IAEA's inspections, the North and the South will 
promote talks to exchange special envoys. However, taking into 
consideration North Korea's pretentious dialogue strategy, it is 
highly likely that in connection with the issue concerning the 
exchange of special envoys, North Korea may avoid discussing 
agenda related with nuclear issues, including North-South mutual 
inspections. 
  In addition, even though North-South dialogue is resumed to 
reopen the channel for North-South high-level talks and to 
implement the North-South Basic Agreement, North Korea may avoid 
implementing the basic agreement. This is because North Korea 
has actually denied the channel for high-level talks through its 
proposal for the exchange of special envoys and it is concerned 
about the possibility of unrest caused by brisk exchange and 
cooperation. 
  Accordingly, even if a point of compromise is smoothly 
reached in North Korean-U.S. negotiations, the stage for fully 
implementing the basic agreement may not be reached. 
  North-South economic exchange and cooperation will depend 
upon the progress of the negotiations over the nuclear issue. 
However, if North Korea assumes the attitude to accept nuclear 
inspection, North-South economic exchange and cooperation will 
be brisk. 
  Even if North-South economic exchange becomes brisk, taking 
into consideration North Korea's lack of foreign currency and 
the backwardness of its production capacity, the rapid 
development of North-South economic cooperation may be 
difficult. However, it is expected that if processing-for-wages 
trade [imgagong kyoyok] smoothly develops, the North and the 
South will launch a small-scale joint venture in the light 
industry field at the Nampo industrial complex. 
  North-South social and cultural exchanges may be expanded 
gradually. However, it is highly likely that North Korea may 
avoid discussing and delaying the issue concerning separated 
family members.

  [Text] The government's view of the North Korean nuclear 
issue seems to have become more optimistic than ever this new 
year. Establishment of diplomatic relations between the United 
States and North Korea and between Japan and North Korea has 
emerged to be a new issue under the precondition of solution of 
the North Korean nuclear question. 
  The government believes the North Korean nuclear issue will 
be resolved no later than the end of the first half of the year. 
Accordingly, it considers North Korea's establishment of 
diplomatic relations with the United States and Japan to be the 
most important issue for this year and is preparing various 
measures for this. 
  This viewpoint of the government is based on the situation 
providing three amicable conditions [segaji uhojok sanghwang]. 
First, the United States and North Korea have nearly reached an 
agreement on the point at issue, that is, nuclear inspections by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and resumption of 
South-North dialogue. North Korea has reportedly decided to 
allow the IAEA's ordinary [tongsang] inspections of its seven 
reported facilities and to accede to South-North dialogue. 
  The United States and North Korea have already agreed to the 
method of lump-sum solution which requires, along with nuclear 
inspection, North Korea to resume working-level contacts for the 
envoy exchange between South and North Korea, the United States 
to release its schedule for the third high-level talks with 
North Korea, and the ROK to announce the suspension of the Team 
Spirit exercise in this new year. This means no further revised 
proposal is available as the sides have extremely narrowed their 
differences. 
  Second, North Korea has recently shown a series of changes 
in 
its reaction. In Kim Il-song's New Year address following the 
North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's 30 December statement, 
North Korea considered an agreement between the United States 
and itself to be an established fact. The government analyzed 
this as North Korea's new attitude that it had never showed in 
the past. 
  Secret changes inside North Korea are worth watching in 
connection with this. In particular, North Korea admitted the 
failure of its economic development plan in the Supreme People's 
Assembly's [SPA] meeting held last month. It has also 
rearranged its internal system by deploying key members for 
South-North dialogue at the front. The government attaches 
significance to this fact. It believes that North Korea has 
closely analyzed the effectiveness of the nuclear card during 
the meeting. After the SPA meeting, North Korea changed its 
inactive attitude toward dialogue with the United States, which 
was just aimed at avoiding sanctions by the United Nations, and 
is now very active in dialogue with the United States. The 
government noted that this change was a result of North Korea's 
reflection on its nuclear policy. 
  A senior official of the government analyzed, "The North 
Korean nuclear card ends in failure. If North Korea had not 
used the nuclear card, it could have achieved an earlier 
establishment of diplomatic ties with the United States and 
Japan." He views that as North Korea came to know this well, 
the nuclear issue will be resolved after passing its final 
crisis in the first half of this year. No matter what the 
reason was, the United States and North Korea have reached an 
agreement to resolve the issue by making mutual concessions at 
the critical moment that required them to choose dialogue or 
sanctions. Observers say that a U.S.-North Korean agreement has 
been made though it has not yet been announced, and anticipate 
that things will go on in the following order: negotiations 
between the IAEA and North Korea on the nuclear inspection, an 
IAEA inspection team's visit to North Korea for the nuclear 
inspection, suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, an envoy 
exchange between South and North Korea, and the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. Further, it is expected 
that South-North summit talks will be held when the nuclear 
issue is nearly resolved. 
  President Kim Yong-sam said that "the North Korean nuclear 
issue will be resolved early this year," and that "an important 
turning point will be prepared in the new year," based on this 
viewpoint. 
  It is true that the North Korean nuclear question has now 
entered a stage of a smooth solution. It is a prevailing 
observation that the Korean peninsula will ride on the thawing 
tide. However, how long this trend will be maintained is still 
unclear because many potential obstacles still remain. In 
particular, the special [tukpyol] inspection issue to be 
discussed in the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks is 
delicate enough to bring North Korea's withdrawal from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

consultative talks with all three parties of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) this and next month, the Foreign 
Ministry said Monday. 
  The third South Korea-U.S. Dialogue for Economic Cooperation 
(DEC) is slated for Feb. 15-16 in Washington followed by a 
meeting of the South Korea-Mexico Economic, Science and 
Technology Cooperation Committee in Mexico City the next week. 
  Talks with Canada open Jan. 26-27 in Seoul, the ministry 
said. 
  This year's consultations will be specially handy since the 
cross-boundary NAFTA took effect on Jan. 1 and Seoul will have a 
chance to get acquainted and ready for possible trade 
repercussions from the agreement, officials said. 
  Assistant Minister Son Chon-yong, Seoul's chief delegate to 
the talks, plans to discuss parts of the agreement that may 
discriminate against South Korea's exports and investment in the 
three countries, they said. 
  Seoul expects to conclude an agreement on avoidance of 
double 
taxation and investment guarantee pact with Mexico to help South 
Korean companies enter the U.S. market via the South American 
country, they said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- The government and its 
party are working on a redistricting plan in preparation for 
local elections in 1995 that has the opposition up in arms. 
  Under a draft of this plan, the six special cities under 
direct central government control will become ordinary cities. 
Pusan, Taegu, Inchon, Kwangju and Taejon will become local 
administrative units like other cities, but Seoul, with a 
population of more than 10 million, will be split into four 
cities as the government thinks that it has grown too large to 
administer effectively. 
  Several cities and counties will be merged for more 
effective 
administration because, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party 
[DLP] says, the present system of stratified government is a 
legacy of the authoritarian past. 
  Rep. Sin Sang-sik, chairman of the DLP ad hoc committee on 
political affairs, says that his committee is reviewing a plan 
to split Seoul into four cities. 
  The opposition Democratic Party is opposed to the DLP's plan 
for Seoul's division, accusing the government party of resorting 
to redistricting because it is unsure of victory in the 1995 
mayoral election, the first in many years. 
  The opposition party objects less vociferously, however, to 
the plan to rezone cities and counties to create integrated 
urban-rural administrative units. 
  Rapid urbanization has made it almost impossible in many 
places to draw a clear line between a rural and an urban area, 
and this warrants the creation of integrated urban-rural 
administrative units in some provinces. 
  In South Kyongsang Province, for example, Sin says, Miryang 
City has a population of 70,000 and Miryang County a population 
of 50,000, and it is hard to tell the city administration from 
the county administration in this case. 
  "It's nonsense to separate Miryang City from Miryang County 
and vice versa," he says. 
  This also applies to Kimhae City and Kimhae County in the 
same province, according to Rep. Kim Yong-il, whose district it 
is. He says a merger of the county into the city is desirable 
for reduced administrative demands and for the convenience of 
the residents. 
  Relatively large cities divided into wards (Ku) are not 
targeted for merger with counties in the DLP plan. They are 
Chonju, Ulsan, Puchon, Songnam, Suwon and Masan. 
  Small cities such as Chechon, Sokcho, Tonghae and Osan are 
set for merger with adjacent counties. 
  Farmers in counties that merge with cities will continue to 
receive government support, such as farming funds and 
scholarship funds for their children, under the DLP plan. 
  The opposition party is giving an unfriendly look at the 
DLP's local administrative reform plan, calling it 
gerrymandering for victory in next year's local elections. In 
particular, it strongly opposes Seoul's division, considering it 
a plot to win the mayoral election.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Tuesday that the city of Seoul will not be split for next 
year's local elections and that the mayoral election in Seoul 
will be held under the present legislative district system. 
  Gubernatorial elections, including the Seoul mayoral 
election, will be held in the first half of next year, as 
promised, the chief executive told reporters while exchanging 
New Year's greetings with them. 
  An opposition mayor of Seoul would pose no problem to him in 
carrying out his job as chief executive because the constitution 
guarantees his rights and duties as president, he said. 
  In the United States, there appears no problem between 
President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration and the 
Republican mayor of New York, Kim added. In Japan, there was no 
problem in the Liberal Democratic Party administration while 
Minobe, who was elected on the Socialist Party's support, ruled 
Tokyo for 12 years. 
  He said premature election enthusiasm is not desirable in 
view of the nation's pressing task to boost the economy. 
  "The elections are still one and half years away, but the 
press has already begun carrying speculative reports on 
anticipated candidates to arouse public interest in the 
elections," he noted. 
  Meanwhile, ruling Democratic Liberal Party Secretary-General 
Mun Chong-su said his party was not studying a plan to revise 
administrative districts for next year's local elections. 
  "My party will by no means push ahead with such a plan," he 
added.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- The ruling and opposition 
parties have begun to strengthen their organizations and select 
possible candidates in preparation for introduction of an 
across- the-board local autonomous government system. 
  The system, under which members of provincial and city 
councils and heads of autonomous governing bodies will be 
elected, will be introduced in the first half of 1995. 
  Both the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the main 
opposition Democratic Party (DP) regard the local elections as a 
"prelude" to parliamentary elections in 1996 and the 
presidential poll in 1997. 
  Consequently, sources expect the parties to come out with 
strategies to win the local elections following their national 
conventions in mid-1994. 
  The DLP, especially, believes that the local elections will 
be a referendum on President Kim Yong-sam's administration. 
  DLP insiders said Tuesday that senior party officials have 
already decided to solidify the leadership and select candidates 
for local elections without fanfare while trying to prevent 
overheating of the election atmosphere. 
  Prior to its national convention in May, the DLP will 
undertake the reorganization of 95 local party chapters, 
replacing some chairmen and strengthening organizational works. 
  In addition, the government and ruling party plan to replace 
city mayors and county chiefs with "reform-minded" officials in 
a large- scale reshuffle so that some of them can be DLP 
candidates in the local elections. 
  The opposition party, meanwhile, plans to form an election 
planning board this month to undertake a study, and to select 
and educate possible candidates for the elections. 
  The DP will launch a committee to strengthen party 
organizations by replacing the chairmen of its local branches 
and taking other measures. 
  The DP is slated to convene a national convention in May 
1995, but there is a possibility that it could be called sooner 
as a result of competition for the national leadership prior to 
the convention. 
  In this connection, Chairman Yi Ki-taek's private political 
group plans to complete a nationwide organization by the end of 
next month before beginning active recruitment for support of 
the leader. 
  Among Yi's challengers are Rep. Kim Won-ki, a member of the 
party's Supreme Council, and Rep. Chong Tae-chol. both plan to 
campaign for support regardless of when the national convention 
is held, according to DP sources. 
  But the DP believes that it is undesirable to enter the 
preparatory stage for local elections at this time as it is 
trying to force the National Assembly to convene an 
extraordinary session in January. 
  Nevertheless, the party is quietly proceeding with plans to 
select candidates for local elections and educate them while 
developing party strategies, the sources said.

  [Text] The government, in order to lure back foreign direct 
investors, plans to provide them with benefits in taxation and 
overseas borrowing as generously as China and other Southeast 
Asian nations do. 
  It will also accelerate deregulation in many financial 
sectors, including abolishing the Foreign Exchange Control Act 
in five years' time, Minister of Finance Hong Chae-hyong said 
yesterday. 
  Meeting with reporters, Minister Hong said that inducements 
for more foreign direct investments are quintessential for 
advancing Korea's technological level and "to this end, the 
government is willing to offer various incentives now offered by 
other Asian nations to would-be investors." 
  "Some areas, like providing factory land at cheap prices, 
may 
be beyond the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry," Hong said. 
"But in financial and taxational matters, we will work hard." 
  He said the efficiency ratings of financial attaches 
stationed at major international economic centers, including 
Tokyo, London and some European capitals, will be based on their 
ability to attract foreign investments. 
  The dwindling amount of foreign direct investment here, 
which 
many analysts say is due to steep rises in labor, land and 
capital prices compared with other Asian countries, has hindered 
Korea's economic recovery, largely dependent on imported capital 
and technology. 
  In a major departure from its stringent control on the 
business plans of major state-run banks, the ministry will this 
year let banks work out their own business plans and implement 
them under their own responsibility, the finance minister said. 
  The restrictive foreign exchange sector will be drastically 
deregulated for the complete abolition of control in five years, 
he said. 
  Various restraints in the banking, securities and insurance 
sectors, some of which have been relegated to umbrella 
organizations, including the Bank of Korea, will be further 
"shaken away," Hong said. 
  "Even if the ministry is reduced to a mere policy research 
organization, we will continue to do away with unnecessary 
regulations," the top financial policy-maker said. 
  Asked whether and when the government plans to permit the 
introduction of foreign commercial loans, however, Hong made it 
clear that the ministry will not allow them for the time being. 
  Between the two types of foreign commercial loans, cash 
loans 
are out of the question, he said, adding that if businesses want 
such loans to help finance facility imports, then they should 
use the government's foreign currency loans. 
  Instead, the ministry is considering exempting foreign 
currency loans from the combined credit ceiling imposed on large 
industrial conglomerates, a measure to help them use more 
foreign exchange loans for facility investments, the finance 
minister said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- The Board of Audit and 
Inspection (BAI) will conduct an intensive investigation into 
laxities in budget make-up and execution by each government 
agency and every state-financed institution so that the public 
gets value for its tax payments, BAI Chairman Yi Si-yun said 
Monday. 
  The BAI will focus its investigative might on evils such as 
shoddy construction of public facilities and irregularities in 
public welfare, and relax administrative regulations to remove 
public inconvenience and insecurity, Yi pledged in his New Year 
speech. 
  He warned wrongdoers and idlers in public service that he 
will punish them mercilessly, but promised creative and active 
public servants that they will be rewarded. 
  Yi, spelling out the New Year's tasks of the independent 
investigative agency, said he will step up efforts to establish 
strict discipline in public service. 
  Instead of correcting wrong government policies, the BAI 
will 
concentrate on strengthening its power to prevent mistakes and 
to raise the efficiency and appropriateness of policies in 1994, 
Yi said. 
  It will establish an around-the-clock investigative 
structure 
and carry out future-minded inspections to expand the authority 
of the BAI, Yi said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- Hong Kol-hui took a bribe 
of 10 million won from Samsung Co. when he was foreign 
procurement director at the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), a 
spokesman for the joint military-prosecution team investigating 
the arms scam said Tuesday. 
  Hong, who is already under arrest in connection with the 
fraud, was paid off by Pak Tae-chin, a former Samsung board 
member. At the time, Hong was involved in the purchase of 
reserve engines for the Air Force's C-130 transport planes. 
  The team may ask Pak to answer the suspicion that he bribed 
Hong in connection with his company's tender for the purchase 
contract. 
  The investigation, including tracing the bank accounts of 
DLA 
Commander Yi Su-ik and his three predecessors (Chang Hong-yol, 
Yi Sang-ho and Yi Chun), will continue until Friday, two days 
longer than planned, according to sources. 
  Plans to question Former Defense Security Commander Kim 
To-yun have been dropped, they said.

  [Text] Seoul, Dec. 31 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Logistics 
Agency (DLA) deceived the Defense Ministry's weapons systems 
acquisition council into selecting a particular firm to supply 
command and fire control systems for destroyers, the Board of 
Audit and Inspection says in a white paper 1993 released 
Thursday. 
  In May, having decided to procure either the COSIS 200k1 
system of Germany's AE or the SSCSMK system of Britain's 
Baesema, the council asked the DLA for a document with which to 
evaluate the British firm's ability to deliver the system within 
the set period. 
  Baesema forwarded the document and a bank affidavit 
guaranteeing its financial solvency to the DLA within a week. 
  But the DLA concealed the British firm's documents and 
advised the council that it was not an adequate contractor 
because of its poor financial status and low credibility, 
misleading the council into selecting AE. 
  The council's dominant opinion was that the British product 
was optimum for Korean destroyers and better than the German 
product, but the DLA's misinformation led the council to select 
the German system, the white paper says. 
  The board recommended that the Defense Ministry take action 
against DLA deputy foreign procurement officer Yun Sam-song for 
producing the misinformation, and the ministry disciplined him.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- A debate among Army 
officers has concluded that the military should root out private 
societies from within its ranks and severely punish their 
organizers to establish harmony and unity, according to Army 
headquarters Tuesday. 
  Seven generals and 35 field grade officers discussed more 
than 30 topics at a seven-day debate hosted by the Defense 
Ministry from Dec. 23-29 last year. They covered consciousness, 
personnel, promotion, morale, welfare, exercise, ways to secure 
high-quality manpower and manage reserved war potential, 
command, control, telecommunications, computers and information. 
  Most attendants, selected by the ministry, lived together 
during the debate, which concluded that societies like "Hanahoe" 
and "Aljahoe" create disharmony within the military and tarnish 
the honor of the military. 
  Society members were accused of monopolizing major posts, 
which they exchange among themselves, and of being exclusive to 
officers from rival societies. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae instructed Army headquarters 
and the three armies Dec. 22, a day after he was appointed, to 
organize seven-day debates to discuss military reform and report 
back directly to him. 
  There were some who said the ministry should punish club 
members more severely than at present and give them 
disadvantages in personnel management and promotion. 
  Some worried that former society members, insisting they 
have 
led the military so far, will strengthen their unity against the 
disadvantages they have suffered since the government was 
inaugurated in February last year. 
  Minister Yi is an ex-member of Hanahoe, along with former 
Presidents Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- The Trade, Industry, and 
Energy Ministry started to work on the refitting of its 
organization on Tuesday. 
  Minister Kim Chol-su said at a staff meeting the need has 
arisen to revamp his ministry's function and organization in the 
area of trade and resources. 
  "We must make our ministry offices better meet new 
administrative needs and fully adapt oursevels to changes of 
time characterized by the conclusion of the Uruguay Round 
talks," Kim said. 
  Ideas of reorganization discussed at the meeting included 
the 
creation of an industry technology bureau, and the integration 
of trade promotion and trade cooperation bureaus and the office 
of international cooperation into two bureaus: Trade policy and 
international cooperation. 
  A ministry source said that if and when three offices are 
merged into two, the post of deputy directorate would be set up 
at each of the two new bureaus. 
  In the resources area, a tentative plan calls for the merger 
of the existing four bureaus into two. 
  Resources development bureau would be merged into petroleum 
and gas bureau while half of the duty of energy policy bureau 
would be turned over to industrial policy bureau and the other 
half to power energy bureau, the source said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- The government will 
recruit 48,018 public servants this year, 3,224 fewer than last 
year, the Government Administration Ministry said on Monday. 
  The central government will hire 21,994 of them, up 1,018 
from last year chiefly because of an increase in the employment 
of teachers and education officials, and local governments will 
take the other 26,024, down 5,075 from last year. 
  Those recruited through competitive tests conducted by the 
Government Administration Ministry will number 3,457 to 3,507 -- 
327 through higher civil service tests, 725 through grade-seven 
civil service tests, 2,115 through grade-nine civil service 
tests, 250 to 300 through higher judicial service tests, and 40 
through military judicial service tests. 
  Those to be recruited through higher civil service tests 
comprise 250 through administrative service tests, 35 through 
diplomatic service tests, compared with 30 last year, and 42 
through technological service tests. 
  Among the 250 to be recruited through administrative service 
tests will be specialists in international trade, educational 
administration, social welfare, and labor. Computer specialists 
are included in the 42 to be hired through technological service 
tests.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- The Korea Stock Exchange 
got a high-kicking start to the New Year with the all-share 
index jumping 13.14 points in 120 minutes Monday to close at 
879.32. 
  Breaking last year's high of 874.1, recorded on Dec. 17, the 
two- hour session caught fire on investment in large 
capitalization issues. 
  The actual gain from last year's close is 22.21 points when 
the ex-dividend index of 857.11 is considered. 
  Securities experts attribute the bull mood to high 
expectations for the economy and inter-Korean relations in 1994. 
  January is generally bullish and hopes for an improved 
economy helped to pump up stock prices, the experts said. 
  There remain fears over sale of stock stabilization fund 
holdings worth 4 trillion won, but they did not show in Monday's 
session, he said. 
  Most banking and securities issues leaped to the daily 
ceiling and shares in construction and trade industries made a 
strong showing while high-cost low (per) price/earnings ratio 
and large manufacturing issues were bearish. 
  Gainers totaled 610, including 358 that hit the daily 
ceiling, outnumbering 146 losers while 55 remained unchanged. 
  Some 22 million shares changed hands on turnover of 436.1 
billion won (540 million U.S. dollars) during the two-hour 
session.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- A strong final quarter 
reduced the trade deficit to 1.35 billion U.S. dollars on a 
customs clearance basis last year, the Trade, Industry and 
Energy Ministry said Monday. 
  The ministry, however, expected a trade surplus of 2 billion 
dollars in terms of international payment. 
  Exports were 82.44 billion dollars (up 7.6 percent) and 
imports 83.8 billion dollars (up 2.5 percent), slashing 3.78 
billion dollars from the 1992 deficit. 
  Exports hit 8.15 billion dollars and imports 7.44 billion 
dollars in December for a 712 million-dollar surplus, the fourth 
monthly surplus in a row. It was the second largest surplus 
after 887 million dollars in December 1991. 
  As of Dec. 25, letter-of-credit (L/C) arrivals reached 3.85 
billion dollars and import approvals were 5.33 billion dollars. 
  In the first quarter, exports rose 7.1 percent from the same 
period in 1992, but in may labor disputes and weak demand from 
China hampered exports. In September, industrial peace came and 
the Japanese yen's strength boosted exports and brought the 
first monthly trade surplus in four years by international 
payments. 
  For the whole year, electronic, electric, automobile and 
machinery exports posted double-digit rises, while exports of 
shoes, textiles and containers dropped by a large margin. 
  Exports to the United States, Japan and European Community 
rose 0.8 percent, putting an end to their consecutive decline 
since 1990. The three markets accounted for 47.5 percent of 
total Korean exports, dropping below 50 percent for the first 
time. 
  Exports to developing countries soared 16.7 percent, 
compared 
with 24.3 percent in 1992, and Asian countries accounted for 
47.5 percent of total exports, compared with 42.9 percent in 
1992. 
  The ministry predicted exports at 89.5 billion dollars, up 
8.6 percent, and imports at 89.5 billion dollars, up 6.8 
percent, for a trade balance this year.

  [Text] The insurance working-level conference of the 
Japan-U.S. General Economic Council met for two days on 12-13 
October in Tokyo following the first meeting on 19 September in 
Hawaii. At the meeting on the 12th, the U.S. side demanded 
correction of "keiretsu" trading which impedes entry by foreign 
companies into Japan. The Japan side also demanded a 
reexamination of the regulations in the United States that vary 
according to states. However, the two views appeared to run 
along divergent lines. At the meeting on the 13th, the U.S. side 
indicated the shares held by foreign companies in the seven 
advanced nations. It pointed out that, compared to the share of 
2 percent in Japan, the shares in the other G-7 nations is on a 
double-digit level, and that the reason was the closed nature of 
the Japan market. The discussions were concluded without 
reaching any conclusion and were carried over into the third 
meeting scheduled in November. Later, a senior U.S. Government 
official held a press conference at the U.S. Embassy and 
explained the basic U.S. posture of unilaterally setting 
numerical targets, unless agreement is reached on share 
expansion. 
  Following the two-day discussion, a senior U.S. Government 
official held a press conference at the U.S. Embassy and 
clarified the intentions of the U.S. Government. According to 
the official, the items requested of Japan by the United States 
indicate the basic U.S. attitude of seeking share expansion for 
U.S. insurers in the Japan market, and the U.S. Government 
proposal is in line with the report by the Insurance Council, 
but is more concrete in its content. The official also indicated 
the key points of the U.S. demands and negotiations by item as 
follows: 1) Clarification of the conditions for insurance 
businesses to receive licenses. 2) Participation by foreign 
companies in the Insurance Council and industry organizations. 
3) While a certain amount of regulation is necessary for the 
protection of the insurers, easing of measures is requested. 4) 
A change from the licensing procedures to a registration system. 
5) Induction of a broker system. 6) A step-by-step easing of 
controls concerning the third sector. 7) Investigation of the 
"keiretsu" problem by the Fair Trade Commission. 8) Deciding 
quantitatively measureable shares for U.S. insurance companies. 
9) The United States will not apply sanctions despite an 
inability to achieve share expansion within the prescribed time 
period. 10) The share of foreign companies in Japan is 2 
percent, but the share of foreign companies in the other G-7 
nations is at a double-digit level. 11) The reason for the 
failure of Japan's insurance businesses in foreign nations is 
their lack of competence. 
  Later, a reporter asked: "You stated that you do not intend 
to present figures indicating what the proper shares are for 
foreign companies, and that no sanctions would be applied in the 
event of a failure to achieve the numerical targets. What will 
you do if the Japan market fails to change? The official replied 
in a flexible tone: "The United States intends to reserve 
evoking Article 301 of the trade act (punitive measures against 
unfair trade practices). The reason is that a new insurance 
market will probably be created in line with the Insurance 
Council's report, and such a situation will probably not arise 
in view of the Hosokawa cabinet's priority emphasis on easing 
controls." 
  However, questions were asked repeatedly by the reporters as 
to whether the United States was optimistic about achieving a 
double-digit share, and how many years it expected it would 
require. In reply, the U.S. senior official said that "it would 
probably require a medium to long term." Subsequently, however, 
he revealed that he expected it to take three to four years. In 
addition, despite his statement at the outset that sanctions 
would not be applied against Japan, the nuance of his later 
reply changed to suggest that, "if agreement on shares cannot be 
reached, the U.S. side would unilaterally decide on numerical 
targets, and evocation of the trade act is also possible." 
  At the meeting, the items directly related to policy were 
limited to the induction of a broker system and "keiretsu" 
trading.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of remarks by unidentified "senior U.S. </F>
Government official" at news conference at U.S. Embassy in Tokyo 
following 12-13 October U.S.-Japan discussions on insurance] 
  [Text] Two days of discussions were held regarding the 
insurance issue as one of the areas of negotiations. The aims of 
the United States in this area are to broadly increase market 
access for foreign insurers in the Japan market, and to insure 
the growth of sales of insurance products and services offered 
by foreign insurers with broad competitiveness in the Japan 
market. We have surveyed the Japan market for months, and have 
tried to understand why the share of foreign insurers is 
extremely low. 
  Three data sources were used. The first was the report 
submitted by the Insurance Council in June 1992. The second data 
source was the various comments made by Japanese experts, 
scholars, and the representatives of Japan's insurance industry. 
The third source consisted of members of the insurance committee 
of the ACCJ [American Chamber of Commerce in Japan], who are 
U.S. insurers operating in Japan, and also data from U.S. 
insurers who have relations with Japan. 
  At the meeting on the 12th (October), the Japanese 
Government 
discussed mainly its points of concern vis-a-vis the U.S. 
market. Mr. Wall, the vice president of NAIC [National 
Association of Insurance Commissioners], came to Japan on this 
occasion as one of the delegates and held a press conference 
yesterday at the U.S. Embassy. He explained about the U.S. 
market, saying that, although the Japanese Government criticizes 
the U.S. market, the criticism is unfounded. 
  Today, the U.S. proposal was submitted to the Japanese 
Government. The content corresponds considerably with the report 
submitted by the Insurance Council. Frankly, however, the U.S. 
proposal is more concrete in its content. 
  I cannot talk concretely today about the content of the 
discussions exchanged with Japan's Ministry of Finance. Instead, 
I would like to simply stress some principal points as to why we 
are concerned about Japan's insurance market and system. 
  The first point is that we feel that the lack of 
transparency 
in the Japan market is a serious problem. For example, at the 
present point in time, we are in a situation where it is 
difficult for us to sufficiently understand what the 
prerequisite conditions are to receive business licenses in 
Japan. We believe that it is necessary to make thoroughly public 
the existing rules and guidelines, including guidance, in order 
to maintain transparency. Also, when new policies are introduced 
in the future, they should be made fully public. 
  The second problem point is that foreign insurers are unable 
to participate in the forums of insurer organizations and the 
Insurance Council. We believe that participation by foreign 
insurers in such industry organizations and the council should 
be recognized on a similar basis as participation by Japan's 
insurer companies. 
  We would also like to have participation by foreign insurers 
be recognized not only in insurance, but also in the councils 
and committees controlled and sponsored by the Japanese 
government, as well as in the insurer organizations at the 
private level. 
  The third problem point is the basic thinking regarding 
liberalization. Of course, in order to maintain solvency and to 
protect the consumers and insurees, regulation is necessary. 
However, if the existence of regulation should conversely deter 
reform and competitiveness, it would result in injury to the 
consumers and insurees. The report of the Insurance Council has 
repeatedly pointed out that promotion of competition is the 
purpose in easing controls, and we fully agree on this point. 
  We also believe that licensing procedures regarding 
insurance 
products and services should change to a registration system. In 
other words, we believe that the discretionary authority held by 
the bureaucrats should be abolished. And we believe that, as 
long as there is no problem of solvency, and as long as there is 
no problem from the standpoint of the consumers and insurees, 
new products should be authorized automatically. To rephrase it, 
except in cases where consumer interests are injured, or in 
cases where there is a solvency problem, new products and 
services should be authorized immediately. 
  I would like to move on to the problem of insurance brokers. 
Insurance brokers are people who are legally authorized or 
requested to speak for the interests of not the insurance 
companies, but for the consumers who use insurance. At present, 
the broker system is prohibited in Japan. It is stated in the 
Insurance Council's report that it will be possible to offer 
services to the consumers by authorizing a broker system, and it 
strongly demands the introduction of such a system in Japan. 
  Next, I would like to talk about the problem of the third 
sector. There is noticeable newspaper reporting that "the United 
States opposes easing of controls over insurance in Japan," but 
such reporting is inaccurate and irresponsible. Regarding easing 
of controls in the third sector, it is written in the Insurance 
Council's report that a step-by-step approach should be adopted. 
Particularly concerning the insurance area where smaller 
companies and foreign insurers participate actively, it is 
written that easing controls in the third sector should be 
implemented gradually. 
  We agree with that portion of the report's content. The 
reason is that market practices have been built up over many 
years and cannot be eradicated overnight. We believe that it is 
necessary to allow a transitional period prior to reaching a 
completely new and deregulated situation. 
  As for the "keiretsu" problem, the ACCJ has compiled its 
survey findings on Japan's insurance market. It reports that 
"generally Japan's `keiretsu' companies conduct transactions 
with insurance companies of the same 'keiretsu' in an 
overwhelming number of cases." 
  Because the process of easing controls is continuing, we 
believe that this problem must absolutely be dealt with. At 
least regarding the "keiretsu," it is a problem that Japan's 
Fair Trade Commission should investigate. 
<H3>  Trade Sanctions Will Not Be Applied Despite Unattainment of 
Figures; Concern About 2-Percent Foreign Share in Japan </H3>
  Our goal in the framework discussions is results. We have 
conducted negotiations with Japan regarding trade agreements 
over a number of years, and procedures and processes have 
changed during the period. Also, rules have been revised. 
However, Japan's market itself has not changed, and such a 
situation cannot be tolerated by the United States. We hope that 
concrete results that can be approved will come out of the 
Japan-U.S. trade negotiations. By using qualitative and 
quantitative indices within the framework negotiations, it will 
be possible to evaluate whether the agreed items will prove 
successful. 
  There is one thing I would like to stress. We are absolutely 
not contemplating a situation where figures are used to decide a 
market share with a time limit and, if the share is not achieved 
within the time limit, a trade measure is enforced with the 
United States retaliating against Japan. 
  Our intention is rather to use a group of quantitative and 
qualitative indices and, based on new rules and regulations, to 
determine whether Japan's market is undergoing a change. 
  I would like for you to look at this table [not translated]. 
The shares for foreign insurers are as follows: 18 percent in 
Canada, 10 percent in France and 2 percent in Japan. In the 
United States, foreign insurers who are licensed in the United 
States have a 7-percent share. In addition, foreign insurers are 
able to offer unregistered insurance products called subline 
products and, if this is included, it would exceed 10 percent. 
In other words, these figures indicate an important fact that 
Japan is an outsider positioned in a totally different location 
than the other G-7 nations. 
  In July when the framework agreement was reached, the 
judgment was made that, from the standpoint of macroeconomic 
measurement criteria, Japan stood in a completely different 
location from the advanced nations. In other words, looking at 
the operating balance surplus versus the GDP [gross domestic 
product] and the import ratio--particularly the product import 
ratio versus the GNP, an extremely large gap exists between 
Japan's level and the level of the other advanced nations. 
  It is extremely difficult to gather figures from other 
nations for comparison. Consequently, the sources of these 
figures vary in each nation. Also, we believe that the figures 
submitted to the OECD are unusable. The reason is that the 
figures reported to the OECD have different definitions used by 
the respective nations in collecting data. Because there is 
postal insurance in Japan, the denominator becomes larger when 
postal insurance is included, and the share become lower than 2 
percent. 
  Compared to the other G-7 nations, Japan's insurance market 
is really closed. The share of foreign companies in Britain is 
25 percent, 33 percent in Italy, and 10-13 percent even in the 
United States, France, and Germany, so the gaps with Japan are 
extremely large. 
  Our purpose is to see the Japan market gradually draw closer 
to the other advanced nations. The Ministry of Finance says that 
the share of Japan's insurers in the U.S. market is extremely 
small, and that it is particularly small compared with the 
market share of U.S. insurers in Japan. This is an interesting 
statement, but we believe the figures are inappropriate or 
unrelated for use in this forum. 
  That is to say, what we must look at is how open each nation 
is vis-a-vis foreign insurers as a whole regarding a specific 
market. We are not considering the problem of how a specific 
nation's insurers are faring in a specific nation. 
  Also, what we indicated in our negotiations with the 
Japanese 
Government under the framework agreement are all based on what 
we observed multilaterally, and can be applied to other nations 
on a most-favored-nation base. The results of the negotiations 
with the Japanese Government will generally be applied similarly 
to all nations. It will be likewise regarding insurance, 
telecommunications, autos, auto parts, and medical care 
equipment. 
  According to the data prepared by the NAIC, Japan's insurers 
are generally not very successful in the U.S. market, but the 
insurers of other nations are successful in the United States. 
  Although we are told that Japan's insurers are not 
succeeding 
in the United States, the reason is not because the U.S. 
insurance market is closed or because there is discriminatory 
treatment. 
  We do not know the reasons why Japan's share is low in the 
United States, but insuffficient efforts by the Japanese side, 
indifference toward the U.S. market, or a lack of 
competitiveness are conceivable reasons. Perhaps it is because 
the Japanese companies do business only with the so-called 
traditional customers who have advanced into the United States. 
In any case, what is clear is that other foreign insurers 
besides those of Japan are very successful in the United States, 
and the criticism by Japan that the U.S. insurance market is 
closed is inaccurate and unfair.

<F P=106> ["Rash Acts of Warlikers in War Fever"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppet defence minister, Yi Pyong-tae, reportedly told "a 
ceremony for the commencement of the work this year" on January 
3 that "the army, navy and air force should maintain a strong 
combat posture in the new year, too." 
  Yi Yong-ho, "chairman of the joint chiefs of staff", too, 
let 
out a war hokum that day, saying "the military posture should be 
rounded off to counter the North's threat of war" and "a posture 
of prompt counteraction" should be established. 
  Such belligerent remarks of the puppet army brass hats from 
the beginning of the year blatantly revealed their scheme of 
armed confrontation with the North and they were an intolerable 
grave challenge to the fellow countrymen who aspire to peace and 
reunification of the country. 
  As everyone knows, the DPRK has advanced the 10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation which is 
acceptable to anyone who wants great national unity and 
reunification and a proposal to exchange special envoys in order 
to discuss and solve the pending issues between the North and 
the South, and has made all sincere efforts to carry them into 
effect. 
  The South Korean puppet clique, however, ignoring them, has 
resorted to anti-DPRK intrigues, vociferating about "military 
counteraction" on the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear 
problem" of the North. And this time the puppet clique again 
made provocative outbursts. 
  Facts clearly prove that the South Korean puppets are, 
indeed, anti-dialogue, anti-reunification elements who have no 
will to work for peace and reunification. 
  If the South Korean puppets dare provoke the North, it will 
control the fire with fire on all accounts and mete out a 
deserving punishment to the provocateurs. 
  The South Korean puppets must stop behaving rashly, clearly 
realizing that their acts of pushing the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to an acute phase of confrontation will only result in 
their own self-destruction.

by President Kim Il-song in New Year Address"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- The working people 
across the country are overwhelmed with emotion and joy upon 
receiving the New Year address of the great leader President Kim 
Il-song. 
  Pak Won-pyo, vice-chairman of the State Planning Commission, 
said he would strive to make a new advance in planning by doing 
this work effectively for the thorough implementation of the 
agriculture- first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first 
policy. 
  Yim Chang-tok, vice-chairman of the State Agricultural 
Commission, said: "We will demonstrate once again the true 
advantages of our socialist agricultural system with a bumper 
crop in this meaningful year marking the 30th anniversary of the 
publishing of the rural theses by displaying the revolutionary 
spirit of self-reliance and fortitude to a higher degree." 
  Cho Chong-ung, vice-minister of the local industry, said: 
  "In this year, the first year of adjustment, we will 
improve, 
reinforce and modernize the local industrial factories and adopt 
active measures for the supply of raw materials so as to keep 
the production of consumer goods on a high level." 
  Kang Tong-kun, vice-president of the Academy of Sciences, 
said that the scientists and technicians, upholding the 
revolutionary economic strategy of the party, would direct 
efforts this year to the successful resolution of scientific and 
technical problems arising in implementing the 
agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first 
policy. 
  Choe Chang-kol, secretary of the South Pyongan provincial 
committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, said: 
  "Our party members and working people will thoroughly carry 
out the tasks set forth in the New Year address and thus deal a 
hard blow once again to the imperialists and reactionaries 
manoeuvring to stifle our socialism and fully display to the 
world the invincible might of our revolutionary ranks in which 
the leader, the party and the masses are united singleheartedly."

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 4 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata will meet separately with Premier Li Peng and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen shortly after flying to Beijing on 
Saturday for a two-day visit to China, Japanese officials said 
Tuesday [4 January]. 
  Hata will meet president and Communist Party General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin on Sunday before returning home later in 
the day, the officials said. 
  The China visit will be the first by Hata since he became 
foreign minister and concurrently deputy prime minister in the 
coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last 
August. 
  Hata and Qian met three times last year. 
  North Korea's refusal of international inspections of its 
suspected nuclear facilities may be high on the agenda for talks 
between Hata and Qian, government sources said.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- The United States 
and North Korea are expected to hold an unofficial working-level 
contact this week to wrap up their negotiations on inspection of 
North Korean nuclear facilities, diplomatic sources said Monday. 
  The United States will then hand over detailed plans for 
inspection to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for 
it to work out with North Korea, the sources said. 
  White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers, meanwhile, told her 
weekly press briefing Monday that the talks between the United 
States and North Korea were making "good progress, and we'll 
have an announcement...hopefully soon." 
  "We continue to insist on full inspections," Myers said. "We 
think we're going to get inspections, and we will continue to 
work with the North Koreans as we work toward a final resolution 
of this." 
  Although there had been some progress in the U.S.-North 
Korean talks, they were by no means completed, Myers said. 
  "As Secretary (of State Warren) Christopher said last week, 
that we're moving toward inspection," she said. "That's 
important." 
  Asked about North Korean President Kim Il-song's New Year's 
Day statement that the North Koreans had reached some sort of 
agreement with the United States, Myers said, "I think that 
that's the status of the dialogue now. We are still in 
dialogue. So, I don't want to suggest that it's completed. But 
I think President Kim sort of indicated that there will be 
inspections." 
  In this connection, the diplomatic sources said that the 
United States had wanted to conclude its negotiations on 
inspections on all seven nuclear sites before 1993 was over, but 
because of some differences of opinion that cropped up in the 
final stage, they had to be carried over to new year. 
Therefore, the United States and North Korea will hold another 
contact in New York this week to work the differences out, they 
said. 
  Unless North Korea comes up with unexpected conditions, the 
two sides will be able to decide on the venue for talks between 
North Korea and the IAEA, they said, indicating that the site of 
North Korean-IAEA meeting had been the stumbling block. 
  As soon as the IAEA inspection gets underway, the United 
States will directly announce the date for a third round of 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks and the suspension of the 
"Team Spirit" military exercise with South Korea. 
  The announcement will also contain a virtual agreement 
between the United States and North Korea on the nuclear issue, 
the sources said. 
  As for the venue for North Korea-IAEA talks, the possibility 
cannot be ruled out that the two sides can decide on it through 
a telephone contact, the sources said. But the sources said 
they could not be optimistic about the outcome of the IAEA-North 
Korea talks since Washington and Pyongyang have not worked out 
details on the IAEA's regular inspection. 
  Over at the State Department, meanwhile, spokesman Mike 
McCurry told his weekly briefing that the dialogue between the 
United States and North Korea "certainly made some progress and 
we expect to continue our discussions." 
  Asked to clarify the North Korean Foreign Ministry statement 
that the talks had made "a breakthrough," McCurry said, "I'm not 
sure we said anything as staggering as `breakthrough'." 
  With regard to Kim Il-song's New Year's Day message on a 
joint statement soon to be issued, McCurry said he believed what 
Kim meant was that "there could be progress on this issue 
through negotiation, and I think that we believe that's an 
accurate assessment."

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- Working people in 
different parts of the country upon receiving the New Year 
address of the great leader President Kim Il-song for 1994 
resolved to vigorously accelerate the general march of socialism 
through their singlehearted unity. 
  Chi Song-yong, a department director of the State External 
Economic Affairs Commission, said that in order to adapt foreign 
trade to the changed circumstances, they would cultivate new 
foreign markets in every possible way and build up an 
unquestionable reputation, increase the production of export 
goods and improve their qualities, develop processing trade and 
thus overfulfill their assignments in foreign trade. 
  Hwang Se-pyong, director of the production guidance 
department of the Ministry of Coal Industry, vowed to 
scrupulously organize economic affairs, skillfully direct 
production and actively enlist the revolutionary enthusiasm and 
creative ingenuity of the masses in compliance with the 
requirements of the party's economic strategy so as to 
overfulfil the yearly coal production plan. 
  No Pong-ho, chairman of the management board of the June 3 
Cooperative Farm in Onchon county, South Pyongan Province, said 
he would work hard to increase per hectare yield of grain 
markedly by realizing the comprehensive mechanization of 
agriculture on a higher level and successfully meeting the 
requirements of the chuche method of farming.

some countries, the road of rebuilding the socialist movement 
and leading it to victory, has been widely disseminated among 
the world's revolutionary parties and peoples aspiring after 
socialism. 
  Joint seminars, seminars, lectures and explanations on the 
work were held on 180 odd occasions in some 80 countries 
including India, Pakistan and Mali. 
  Political parties, organizations and public figures of 
different countries published press statements, articles and 
statements hailing the work. 
  In the past two years after the publication of the work some 
130 press media of 90 odd countries reported the full text or 
gist of the work on more than 200 occasions.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held 
here Tuesday to mark the first anniversary of the publication of 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's immortal classical work 
"Let Us Develop Our Youth Movement to a New, Higher Level" 
(January 5, 1993). 
  In his report at the meeting, Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the 
Central Committee of the League of Socialist Working Youth of 
Korea [LSWYK], said the classical work of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il is a highly important work of great 
significance in rallying the young people around the party in 
one mind and firmly preparing them to be young vanguards who 
defend the party and the leader with their lives and to be 
lifeguards and death-defying corps who defend and exalt 
Korean-style socialism centred on the masses, in face of the 
vicious manoeuvres of the imperialists and reactionaries to 
isolate and stifle our country, the bastion of socialism. 
  The reporter noted that the dear leader called upon the 
young 
people to remain loyal to the socialist cause, supporting the 
party's ideas and leadership and play the vanguard role in the 
nationwide struggle for the reunification of the country and 
advanced tasks to develop the overseas Korean youth movement and 
strengthen unity and solidarity with the progressive youths of 
the world. 
  "It is a heavy yet honorable task facing the youth league 
organisations and officials to unite the young people around the 
party and the leader in one mind, prepare them to be rifles and 
bombs defending the party and the socialist system in the van 
with their lives and put them at the head of the drive to 
implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy for 
hastening the final victory of the socialist cause and the cause 
of national reunification", the reporter said. 
  Stating that the dear leader's guidance is the life and soul 
of the LSWYK and the source of unconquerable might, the reporter 
said the whole league should thoroughly establish a strong 
revolutionary discipline of acting as one under his unitary 
guidance so that the party's line and policy can be the faith 
and will of the young people at all times. 
  The meeting was attended by Secretary of the Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Kim Chung-nin.

Revolutionary Optimism" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- In order to make 1994 
a year of a historical turn in the revolution and construction 
in our country, all the party members and working people must 
stir up themselves and staunchly struggle with revolutionary 
optimism, convinced that they can emerge victorious when they 
advance under the guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, says NODONG SINMUN in an editorial today. 
  It notes: 
  Let us strive harder and advance toward a new victory with 
revolutionary optimism -- this is an important militant slogan 
which our party and people must hold high now. 
  The conviction of victory and revolutionary optimism are our 
invincible ideological and spiritual weapon in the general march 
of socialism at the present time. 
  What is important in winning a new victory, full of 
revolutionary optimism, is that the entire people have the 
unshakable will and faith that they will surely win when they 
advance under the leadership of our party. 
  The mental support for our people is Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  All the party members and other working people must always 
keep in mind the conviction of victory and the future of the 
revolution, deeply understanding his greatness. 
  Loudly singing the song "We Will Win Because You Are Leading 
Us," we must have a strong will, fearing no difficulty, 
adversity and formidable enemy, under the guidance of the dear 
leader. 
  We must also be firmly convinced of the invincibility of the 
cause of Korean-style socialism which is vigorously advancing 
under the banner of the great chuche idea. 
  If our officials and working people are to live and struggle 
with revolutionary optimism, they must learn from the 
ideological and spiritual world of Comrade Yi In-mo who 
steadfastly defended the principle as a revolutionary, convinced 
of the victory of our revolutionary cause.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- 1993 was a fruitful 
year which saw noteworthy achievements in the construction of 
the capital city in Korea. 
  30,000 flats each with a floor space of 90 to 120 square 
metres and with a total plottage of 14.8 million square metres 
were built and some 40 schools, nurseries and kindergartens and 
about 20 public service facilities with a total plottage of 
182,000 square metres made their appearance in Pyongyang last 
year. 
  The three-revolution exhibition and some 40 other monumental 
edifices with a total floor space of 777,000 square metres were 
built, changing the looks of the capital city. 
  These splendid edifices of eternal value are great creations 
of the spirit of devoted service to the people displayed by the 
Workers' Party of Korea which regards the improvement of the 
people's living standard as the supreme principle of its 
activity. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il initiated the 
construction projects in the capital and took all necessary 
measures to successfully carry them out. 
  He organised a strong construction force and indicated the 
direction and ways of construction. 
  He acquainted himself with the progress of the construction 
in each stage, solved knotty problems in time and guided the 
construction on the spot several times. 
  Even when a touch-and-go situation was created by the 
imperialists' moves to unleash a nuclear war, he wisely took 
measures time and again to push ahead with the construction of 
the capital. 
  Greatly encouraged by this, the builders carried out in a 
year the vast construction which would have taken more than ten 
years at an ordinary pace.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 4 (KCNA) -- A composing and 
choreographing machine has been developed in Korea. 
  This machine attracting deep attention from composers and 
choreographers is capable of noting musical pieces and dances 
and freely compiling and printing full scores of music and dance 
notes. 
  When one plays a musical piece he conceived on an electronic 
piano its notes appear on the display along with the sound and 
the completed melodies are printed or saved. 
  And a choreographer can save in a computer by notes dance 
movements he conceivd and recall them on the display and 
complete them through revision. 
  The machine makes it possible to freely record 
comprehensively all rhythmic languages including Taekwon-do, to 
say nothing of dances of different countries, because it 
combines on a theoretical basis some 300 million dance movements 
and more than 2,000 million dance patterns with not many notes. 
  This machine which combines an electronic instrument and a 
computer together helps one create or read a dance adapted to a 
melody. 
  The development of this machine has opened a prospect for 
disseminating new music and dance works at art organizations and 
institutions at a time through a computer network. 
  Computer experts are showing keen interest in this machine, 
saying that it is possible to apply with it the alphabetic dance 
notation to formulae of architectural designing engineering and 
robot engineering and robot engineering (multipurpose robot).

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- The Defense Facilities 
Administration agency on Wednesday [5 January] lodged a formal 
complaint with Tokyo police over the circulation of illegal 
copies of free highway passes for U.S. military vehicles, police 
officials said. Metropolitan Police Department officials said 
they have already launched an investigation into the case, in 
which a large number of such passes are believed to have been 
copied and put to use. 
  The passes for exemption from highway tolls have been issued 
by the Japanese Government for the past 30 years under an 
agreement with U.S. military authorities in Japan. Users of the 
passes simply write down their vehicle number when passing 
through toll booths and the agency later reimburses highway 
administrative bodies. 
  The amount expended by the agency for that purpose amounts 
to 
some 600 million yen a year. 
  According to U.S. military officials, over 900 copied passes 
have been found at toll booths throughout Japan.

officials said. 
  Azuma will visit Botswana, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, 
South Africa, Zimbabwe, India, Nepal and Pakistan before 
returning to Japan on January 27, the officials said. 
  Azuma will visit South Africa to learn about the situation 
there as Japan is considering dispatching election monitors to 
the country for the first multiracial parliamentary elections 
scheduled for next April. His visit to the African nations will 
show Japan's "positive diplomacy" toward the continent following 
the Tokyo International Conference on African Development in 
October, the officials said. Japanese UN peacekeepers are 
currently working in Mozambique. 
  Azuma is visiting the Indian subcontinent countries to 
"deepen friendly relations," they said.

<F P=106> [Article by Susumu Yoshida, managing director, Nissho Iwai: </F>
"Economic Cooperation and Characteristics of Russian Far East; 
Resources and Industries of Far Eastern Region"] 
  [Text] The area of Russia's Far East region is 16 times 
that of Japan and its population is 8 million, so its population 
density is 1.3 per square kilometer. 
  The Russian Far East is made up of seven administrative 
units, such as the Maritime Kray, the Sakhalin Oblast, 
Khabarovsk Kray, and the Sakha Republic. 
  In this region are such resources as rich timber (30 percent 
of the total for the former Soviet Union), aquatic products (40 
percent), diamonds (98 percent), gold (50 percent), and tin (80 
percent). 
  In terms of industrial structure, lumbering, nonferrous 
metals, and fisheries make up 50 percent of the extractive and 
manufacturing industries. Its secondary industries lag markedly, 
with 80 percent of consumer goods and 50 percent of the food 
brought in from other areas. 
  Efforts were made to develop defense industries in the 
1930's; and the city of Komsomolsk-na-Amure became a center for 
steel, petroleum refining, shipbuilding and aircraft industries. 
Vladivostok provided supplies and repair as a base for the 
Pacific Fleet. 
<H5>  Far Eastern Area in Era of Reform </H5>
  In a speech in Vladivostok in July 1986, Secretary General 
Gorbachev stressed that economic development of the Far Eastern 
region was inseparable from the strengthening of economic 
cooperation and trade relations with Asian nations. 
  Keenly sensing that if carrying out the "Program for Far 
East 
Regional Development by 2000" (August 1987) were to end in 
failure each region, would require economic self-reliance, 
Nakhodka, Sakhalin, and Vladivostok applied to the union in 
1988-91 for conversion into free-economy zones. The Yakutia, 
Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and Maritime regions are proclaiming 
sovereignty over management and utilization of resources within 
their areas. Also, in August 1990 they set up a Far East 
Economic Association, taking up such matters common to each 
state as energy, foodstuffs, construction, transportation, and 
military-to-civilian conversion, and they plan to pull together. 
One of this association's achievements was drawing up the May 
1991 "Concept for Solving the Far East Region's Crisis and 
Economic Development by 2000"; but due to the coup of August 
1991 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in December that year, 
they did not get so far as to draw up an action program. 
  After that, based on a September 1992 presidential decree, 
they deliberated on the "Far East development program" in light 
of Russian and Far East conditions; and there are moves to try 
to draw up the policies. 
<H5>  Economic Cooperation in the Far East </H5>
  What actions might be needed for now to bring about further 
development of economic cooperation? 
  1. Expansion of Trade Deals 
  With trade between Japan and Russia totaling $3.48 billion 
in 
1992, it has fallen to 57 percent of its peak. Likewise, imports 
also were down 26 percent to $2.5 billion; but a majority of 
that was foodstuffs, lumber, coal, etc., for which the Far East 
is a producing area. Hence, the Russian Far East is unchanged in 
being a supplier of raw materials. As disruptions in the 
economic system are causing the import reductions, considerable 
recovery of trade volume is possible by bringing about quality 
guarantees and strict observance of delivery dates 
(normalization of rail transport and port operations). 
  2. Effective Use of G-7 Economic Aid 
  Aid totaling $43.4 billion was set for 1993; but it is 
necessary to place all possible emphasis on the Far East for the 
portion that is bilateral aid, to quickly set up also the Far 
East region's receiving facilities and to put into effect an aid 
program for shifting to a market economy. 
  3. Assistance for Preparing Infrastructure 
  With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia lost 60 
percent 
of the port facilities, making the bolstering of its Far East 
harbors an urgent task. Also called for are double-tracking of 
Amur River bridges which are a bottleneck to Siberian rail 
transport, electrification of some rail lines, and adding to and 
rebuilding power generation facilities so as to improve the 
energy balance. Since these items will be the basis for future 
development of the Far East, is not the time upon us when we 
must consider the methods for cooperation between Japan and 
Russia? 
  4. Resource Development Projects 
  "Siberian development" in the 1970's gave birth to an era of 
Japan-Soviet cooperation centering on coal, lumber, and harbors; 
and pushed Japan-Soviet trade up sixfold over a 10-year period. 
Areas for cooperation henceforth may center on energy, 
especially oil and gas. For the present, it is important to 
continue the forestry development and Sakhalin continental shelf 
gas and oil exploitation projects that are ongoing and to get 
them on track. 
  Also, the Republic of Korea is considering development of 
Yakutia gas by tieing up with the Sakha Republic, and it has 
particulars from joint Japan-U.S.-Soviet investigations 
conducted in the 1970's. Furthermore, since Yakutia gas also is 
positioned to be a major source in Russia's own Far East energy 
development plan (the Vostok plan), the chances are high of its 
becoming a project for multinational cooperation. 
  For other subsurface resources as well, the exploitation of 
such metals as gold, tin, and lead, construction of iron mills 
due to development of Aldan iron ore and copper smelters due to 
development of the Udokan copper mines (Chita region), etc., may 
become objects for study as future projects. 
<H5>  Pressing To Improve Japan-Russia relations </H5>
  As discussed above, there are any number of subject areas 
for 
economic cooperation in Russia's Far East. The premises for that 
are Russia's political and economic stabilization and clarifying 
the authority of the center and local regions; but resolution of 
the territories problem--a longstanding issue between Japan and 
Russia, establishing neighborly relations by concluding a peace 
treaty and resolving these by organically linking them with 
economic cooperation are to be hoped for. 
  The cold war structure having collapsed, a situation has 
emerged in which Japan, as one of the G-7 nations, will take on 
a major role in aiding Russia. Russia's Far East has made 
requests to the center for assistance; but those have not been 
met. There has never been a time like the present when "new 
thinking" has been so required of both Japan and Russia.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- The House of Councillors' 
special committee on political reform resumed debates Wednesday 
[5 January] morning on four government-proposed political reform 
bills with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
boycotting the session. In a meeting of committee managers 
earlier in the day the LDP demanded that the resumption of 
debates be postponed until Thursday, parliamentary sources said. 
The ruling seven-party coalition rejected the LDP's request and 
started debates at 11:40 A.M. 
  The special committee entered a year-end and New Year recess 
on December 28. The ruling coalition decided Tuesday to 
complete debate on political reform at the special committee by 
January 14 even if the LDP boycotts the session. The government 
reform package was passed by the House of Representatives on 
November 18 but deliberations in the upper house stalled for 
over a month through late December due partly to the resistance 
of the LDP. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political 
future on enactment of the reform package in the current Diet 
session, which ends January 29. 
  Meanwhile, Ichiro Ozawa, a chief coalition strategist, told 
a 
meeting of the executives of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], of 
which he is co-leader, that the coalition should seek to push 
the package through the upper house "by January 20, even if its 
passage were delayed." 
  "If parliamentary proceedings went without hindrance, we 
would be able to secure its passage through the House of 
Councillors plenary session on January 17," he said. 
  "The most serious point would come on the 20th if its 
passage 
were delayed," said Ozawa, who is widely regarded as the most 
powerful behind-the-scenes figure in Hosokawa's coalition 
government. Ozawa also said the coalition would have no 
alternative but to table yet another pump-priming supplementary 
budget bill to a regular Diet session that will convene on 
January 31. 
  "We should place priority on pushing the political reform 
bills through the Diet," he said. "If we were left with one 
week's time after the prospective passage, it might be 
physically sufficient to hold parliamentary deliberations for 
passing the supplementary budget bill," he said. 
  Ozawa hinted, however, it might take more than a week to 
hammer out necessary political compromises with the LDP over the 
budgetary bill, saying it would be difficult to pass it in a 
week, from a commonsense point of view.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- The opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] agreed Wednesday [5 January] to 
temporarily end its boycott of parliamentary debate on a 
government-proposed package of political reform bills, LDP 
officials said. The LDP boycott earlier forced the ruling 
coalition to deliberate on the package in the absence of the 
largest opposition force in a Diet session that reconvened the 
same day. 
  As a result of the LDP concession, legislators from the LDP, 
the Japanese Communist Party [JCP] and the Niin Club 
parliamentary group will question Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and other ministers in Thursday's session, the 
officials said. However, the LDP and ruling coalition partners 
failed to hammer out an accord on the parliamentary agenda for 
Friday and thereafter, they said. 
  Meanwhile, the coalition decided to hold mandatory 
parliamentary hearings of a selected group of political 
scientists and citizens on the package on January 12, coalition 
officials said. Such hearings are mandatory procedures that 
have to be followed before a vote on the package. 
  A standoff between the coalition and opposition, which has 
been demanding major modifications to the package, will be 
inevitable if the coalition proceeds with the hearings, LDP and 
coalition officials agreed. 
  The ruling coalition earlier agreed to modify a proposed 
legal requirement that the Diet refuse to allocate House of 
Representatives seats to miniparties that failed to collect 3 
percent of valid votes cast at the most recent national 
election, coalition officials said. 
  The agreement came at a meeting of the executives of seven 
coalition partners at the coalition's political reform 
headquarters, the officials said. 
  Both LDP and JCP have been demanding that the controversial 
provision be removed from the package of four political and 
electoral reform bills. 
  The electoral bill calls for replacing the current 511-seat 
lower chamber with a mixture of 274 single-seat constituencies 
and proportional representation system, under which an 
additional 226 seats would be distributed on a nationwide basis. 
  The so-called "3-percent requirement" would oblige the Diet 
to deny miniparties that failed to win 3 percent of eligible 
votes any seats that would be appropriated to bigger parties 
that met the requirement in proportion to the number of votes 
they had mustered in single-seat constituencies. 
  The provision also means that unless a party has the record 
of winning 3 percent of votes in the most recent national 
election, it is not qualified to receive an official subsidy to 
finance its political activities from a newly created fund of 
30.9 billion yen. 
  The LDP and JCP have argued that such a provision would 
undermine the Diet's ability to translate into national policies 
the desires of voters who placed their trust in miniparties that 
failed to garner 3 percent of eligible votes. 
  Yamahana told the House of Councillors' special committee on 
political reform, "The most crucial thing is to legislate the 
package. We will do our utmost by responding sufficiently to 
arguments between the ruling coalition and opposition camp." 
  The committee kicked off the new year's first deliberations 
Wednesday after an eight-day recess, but the No. 1 opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) boycotted the session. 
  In a meeting of committee managers earlier in the day, the 
LDP demanded that the resumption of debates be postponed until 
Thursday, parliamentary sources said. 
  Prime minister told the committee session that reconvened in 
the morning the LDP's boycott is "very regrettable." 
  "It is our heavy responsibility to settle the political 
reform matter in order to revive public trust in politics," he 
said. 
  The ruling coalition decided Tuesday to complete debate on 
political reform at the upper house committee "by January 14" 
even if the LDP continued to boycott the committee sessions, 
coalition officials said. 
  The package cleared the House of Representatives on November 
18, but deliberations had stalled since then due to a 
parliamentary row over the opening of Japan's rice market and a 
payoff scandal involving Hosokawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- Cabinet ministers in charge 
of economic affairs and representatives of ruling coalition 
parties will meet on Thursday [6 January] to continue debate on 
income tax cuts and other economic issues, a government 
spokesman said Wednesday. Leaders of the government and the 
seven coalition parties reached the decision to hold the fourth 
meeting of an economic forum of the government and the 
coalition, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama said at 
a news conference. 
  The meeting was originally set for Wednesday morning but was 
called off after the representatives of the coalition agreed on 
the need for further discussion on proposed income tax cuts and 
an alternative tax revenue among themselves. 
  At Wednesday's meeting of the leaders of the government and 
the ruling parties, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata proposed 
resuming the talks on tax as early as possible to help 
facilitate the formulation of the fiscal 1994 national budget, 
Hatoyama said. 
  All the others present agreed to reopen the meeting of the 
economic committee to continue debate on how to finance 
anticipated income tax reduction, on which the coalition parties 
are split, according to the deputy chief cabinet secretary. 
  Hata, who doubles as deputy prime minister, heads the 
economic forum of the government and the coalition parties. 
  The panel, formed on the orders of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, met three times in late December.

  Both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Japanese

political and electoral reform bills. 
  The electoral bill calls for replacing the current

also means that unless a party has the record of winning 3

qualified to receive an official subsidy to finance its 
political activities from a proposed fund of 30.9 billion yen. 
  Earlier in the day, Sadao Yamahana, minister in charge of 
political reform, first dropped the hint that the coalition may 
accept an opposition demand to soften the 3 percent requirement. 
  The LDP and JCP have argued that such a provision would 
undermine the diet's ability to translate into national policies 
the desires of voters who placed their trust in miniparties that 
failed to garner 3 percent of eligible votes.

  The package cleared the House of Representatives on November

parliamentary row over the opening of Japan's rice market and a 
payoff scandal involving Hosokawa. 
  The LDP has alleged Hosokawa took a 100 million yen 
unreported payoff from the scandal-ridden Sagawa Kyubin trucking 
firm. Hosokawa dismissed the allegation, saying it was a mere 
"loan" he claimed he had repaid. 
  Hosokawa has staked his political career on enactment of the 
reform package in the current Diet session, due to end January 
29.

  "The most serious point would come on January 20 if its

most powerful behind-the-scenes figure in Hosokawa's coalition 
government.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- Japan's top four business 
leaders on Wednesday [5 January] warned against an early Diet 
dissolution as it could damage administration of economic 
affairs, including the compilation of a fiscal 1994 government 
budget. In a joint new year press conference, the business 
leaders stressed the need to pump-prime the economy by an income 
tax cut, and pass political reforms bill by the end of the 
current Diet session January 29. They said the tax cut could be 
financed by "bridge" deficit-financing bonds. 
  Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of 
Corporate 
Executives, said if the House of Representatives was dissolved 
this month it would have a large negative impact on the economy. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), called for steady implementation of 
reforms in all areas -- political, economic, and administrative. 
  Such support for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
government reflects fears that political turmoil could further 
damage the economy, which is still in recession, political 
analysts say. But it would also be a blow to the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party, they say, and the divide between 
businesses and the former ruling party could widen. 
  As to the pending issue of a consumption tax hike to finance 
a cut in personal income taxes, Hiraiwa merely said it is a 
"future issue," while Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan 
Federation of Employers' Associations, said it should be 
considered "after business conditions recover." 
  Both Hayami and Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry, expressed similar views. 
  Referring to the recent recovery of the dollar against the 
yen above the 113 yen line, Hiraiwa said the currency is still 
too low and Japanese companies will be happy if it rises to 
around 120 yen. 
  Hayami, however, said he would like to see the dollar 
stabilize somewhere at the 110 yen level. 
  Nagano said that this year industry should place a priority 
on ensuring employments rather than wage raises, which he said 
are quite difficult for the corporate management to offer.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- A Diet member accused Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Wednesday [5 January] of spending 
the 100 million yen he accepted in 1982 from the scandal-ridden 
Sagawa Kyubin trucking group to bribe his way into the 
governorship of Kumamoto Prefecture. 
  Japanese Communist Party legislator Masaharu Udo said former 
aides of the prime minister have told him that Hosokawa bribed 
Kumamoto prefectural assembly legislators from the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] with the Sagawa money to secure LDP 
endorsement of his candidacy for the governorship. He made the 
accusation at a question and answer session of the House of 
Councillors' special committee on political reform which resumed 
debate after an eight-day recess. 
  Udo quoted one of Hosokawa's election campaign managers as 
stating Hosokawa used the money he accepted from Sagawa to bribe 
prefectural assembly legislators to secure LDP endorsement of 
his candidacy. He said his investigation showed that the 100 
million yen was handed over to Hosokawa "in three installments" 
from October to December of 1982, when a few politicians were 
vying with each other to get LDP support. Hosokawa won the 
party's endorsement and went on to secure the governorship. 
  In reply, Hosokawa denied the allegations, saying the loan 
had nothing to do with his political activities related to the 
gubernatorial election. 
  In Japanese gubernatorial elections, candidates often have 
to 
grease the palms of LDP prefectural assembly legislators to win 
the local chapter's recommendation as an LDP candidate. 
  The LDP's Tokyo headquarters often approves the local 
chapter's recommendation. An LDP endorsement is considered 
crucial in winning over conservative voters used to perceiving 
the LDP as the most reliable provider of stability and pork 
barrel projects. 
  Hosokawa earlier acknowledged that he had borrowed 100 
million yen from Kiyoshi Sagawa, then chairman of the Sagawa 
Kyubin trucking conglomerate, but said he had already repaid the 
loan. 
  Udo renewed the opposition camp's demand that the ruling 
coalition allow the Diet to question Sagawa and Hosokawa's 
former political secretary Masatoshi Miyama by having them 
testify as sworn witnesses. 
  Hosokawa has said he is not aware of the details of the 
deal, 
as it was handled by Miyama who was his secretary when he was a 
House of Councillors legislator in the LDP faction led by the 
late ex- premier Kakuei Tanaka. 
  Udo questioned the truthfulness of Hosokawa's explanation 
that he borrowed the Sagawa money in October 1982, to buy a 
Tokyo condominium and fix the front gate and earthen wall of his 
spacious residence in Kumamoto. 
  The legislator said such an explanation is irrational 
because 
evidence shows that Hosokawa bought the condominium three months 
before the loan and fixed the gate and wall long after receiving 
it. 
  The long time lag between the loan and the repair is 
"irrational in view of the fact that Hosokawa would have had to 
pay interest of 1.8 million yen on the loan annually (if it were 
a loan)," he said. 
  Hosokawa replied, "I borrowed the money one year before the 
gubernatorial election, so it has nothing to do with the 
election."

  [Text] Sendai, Jan. 5 KYODO -- Miyagi Governor Shuntaro 
Honma had kept a covert 10 million yen fund at his disposal 
prior to his arrest and indictment last year, according to an 
internal probe by the Miyagi prefectural government. Honma 
resigned as governor in early October in connection with a 
bribery scandal. 
  Vice Governor Ryoichi Kabaya said the cash was kept in the 
prefectural government's secretarial section. The investigation 
revealed that Governor Honma allegedly approached Seiki 
Sugawara, deputy chief of the commerce, industry and labor 
division, in April 1992 and asked for fat expense accounts. 
  Sugawara promptly started securing a total of 4 million yen 
by writing false business travel reports by the time of the 
February 1993 gubernatorial election, prefectural government 
officials said. 
  In addition, they said, another 6 million yen was withdrawn 
as money gifts and wedding and condolence money from the 
governor's annual official expense account of 17 million yen. 
  Vice Governor Kabaya said the retrieved 10 million yen will 
be turned over to the Miyagi government as revenue under its 
fiscal 1993 budget. 
  Incumbent Governor Shiro Asano expressed shock at the 
results 
of the in-house investigation and vowed to set up a system to 
prevent a repeat of such a bogus expense account scheme. 
  Honma resigned as governor in October last year after his 
arrest in late September. He was indicted October 18 on charges 
of taking a 20 million yen bribe from Taisei Corp., a major 
Japanese construction company, in connection with a prefectural 
project to build a cancer center. He was also indicted again on 
December 1 on charges of receiving a 100 million yen bribe from 
the de facto owner of Japan's No. 3 paper manufacturer, Daishowa 
Paper Manufacturing Co.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- A Japanese Government 
source said Wednesday [5 January] he hopes to see the dollar 
gain further ground to around 115 yen in foreign exchange 
dealings. The source also said a weaker yen would have a 
"favorable impact" on the domestic economy. 
  In Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 113.23 yen at 10:30 
A.M., 
down 0.04 yen from the previous day's close of 113.27 yen, but 
up 0.67 yen from its opening rate of 112.56 yen. The dollar's 
fall at the outset of trading reflected growing concern over its 
rapid rise against the yen in recent trading and profit-taking 
selling, traders said. 
  Many dealers believe, however, that the U.S. currency will 
resume its upward pace against the yen in view of a wide gap of 
economic fundamentals between Japan and the United States. 
  The source said, "I hope to see the dollar appreciate to 
about 115 yen as soon as possible." 
  "I suppose steelmakers are pleased (with the dollar's rise). 
They would be at a loss if the dollar fell below 110 yen," the 
source said. 
  The government source's remarks sparked renewed buying of 
dollars in interbank Tokyo trading Wednesday morning. 
  A dealer at a major commercial bank said, "The dollar will 
gain upward momentum to break through the 115 yen line if the 
U.S. monetary authorities clarify their stance of tolerating a 
weaker yen."

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- The government's tax 
revenues in November declined 3.0 percent from the year before 
to 6,838 billion yen, the Finance Ministry reported Wednesday [5 
January]. The ministry said the November figure brought the 
total income for the April-November period to 27,671 billion 
yen, up 2.4 percent, a rate of growth that could make it 
possible for the government to attain the revised revenue target 
of 55.68 trillion yen for the current fiscal year. 
  In November, corporate tax revenues plunged 13.6 percent to 
3,112.9 billion yen, while revenues from the liquor tax dipped 
1.5 percent to 154.5 billion yen, the ministry said. 
  Income tax revenues gained 5.5 percent to 1,828.8 billion 
yen 
while those from the inheritance tax soared 96.4 percent to 
215.4 billion yen, it said. 
  The consumption tax revenue gained 7.4 percent to 926.9 
billion yen while revenues from securities transactions surged 
61.1 percent to 34.3 billion yen in reaction to a decline in the 
previous year, the ministry said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- The government's 
expenditures topped income by 6,383.3 billion yen for the 
April-December period of last year due largely to an increase in 
public works projects, coupled with dwindling tax revenues, the 
Finance Ministry reported Wednesday [5 January]. 
  The ministry said the net flow of money from the 
government's 
coffers into the private sector was the second largest on record 
next to about 7.4 trillion yen recorded in the same period of 
1981. Its announcement was based on the balance of receipts and 
payments of treasury funds with the private sector. 
  On the general account, tax revenues during the period 
decreased by 2,821.2 billion yen from the like period last year 
while expenditures for public works projects increased 534.2 
billion yen. 
  Social insurance spending also climbed by 220.7 billion yen, 
it said. 
  Outside the general account, an increase in housing loans 
and 
massive dollar buying by the Bank of Japan to prevent the yen's 
appreciation helped boost the net outflow of fiscal funds.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- Japan's foreign exchange 
reserves were up 172 million dollars in December from the 
preceding month, totaling 95.59 billion dollars, the Finance 
Ministry said Wednesday [5 January]. The rise follows 
November's increase of 195 million dollars from October. As a 
matter of policy, Finance Ministry officials do not provide 
detailed reasons for changes in the nation's foreign exchange 
reserves. 
  Foreign exchange reserves consist of foreign currencies, 
gold, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) at the International 
Monetary Fund. 
  According to the latest monthly data available, Japan 
appears 
to have kept its position as the largest foreign exchange holder 
as its reserves were 95.2 billion dollars at the end of October. 
  Taiwan came second with 85.6 billion dollars, followed by 
Germany with 82.2 billion dollars and the United States with 
77.8 billion dollars. Statistics for Taiwan were those at the 
end of September. 
  In 1993 as a whole, the nation's foreign exchange reserves 
increased by 26.9 billion dollars, the first increase in five 
years and the second largest annual increase following the 39.2 
billion dollar rise in 1987. 
  During the year, the dollar traded in Tokyo in a range 
between 100.40 yen and 125.95 yen as the yen picked up upward 
momentum last summer to prompt the Bank of Japan to buy dollars 
for yen to stem the yen's upswing. 
  The central bank's dollar-buying intervention serves to push 
up foreign exchange reserves, although monetary authorities 
usually do not confirm such intervention.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- Reflecting the prolonged 
recession, domestic auto sales in 1993 dropped from the 
year-before level for the third straight year to hit a six-year 
low, an industry association said Wednesday [5 January]. 
  The Japan Automobile Dealers Association said sales of cars, 
trucks and buses, excluding minivehicles, totaled 4,887,179 
vehicles, down 8.4 percent from the previous year. The figure 
was the lowest since 1987 when sales totaled about 4,344,000 
vehicles, the association said. Sales declined in all 
categories for the first time since 1980, underscoring the 
severity of the automobile market slump, association officials 
said. They said there is little possibility of market recovery 
at least until March, with expected sales for 1994 inching up to 
around 5 million vehicles. 
  Of the 1993 total, passenger cars accounted for 3,427,088 
vehicles, down 6.9 percent, posting the third straight 
year-to-year fall, the association said. 
  It said sales of cars with engine capacity of over 2 liters 
dipped 4.2 percent from the year before to 683,763 while those 
of subcompact cars fell 7.5 percent to 2,743,325. 
  The association said sales of trucks were down 11.7 percent 
at 1,632,376 while those of buses totaled 19,025, down 11.8 
percent. 
  Imported car sales grew 9.1 percent to 201,484 vehicles, the 
association said. Among 11 major automakers, only three -- 
Daihatsu Motor Co., Suzuki Motor Corp. and Fuji Heavy Industries 
Ltd. -- posted sales growth, the association said. 
  Industry leader Toyota Motor Corp. suffered a 7.7 percent 
drop in sales while sales of Nissan Motor Co., Mazda Motor Corp. 
and Honda Motor Co. declined 8.4 percent, 16.8 percent and 14.9 
percent, respectively. Mitsubishi Motors Corp.'s sales also 
declined 7.2 percent. 
  In December, the association said, sales totaled 345,715 
vehicles, down 11.1 percent from the year before and down 13.8 
percent from the preceding month. It was the ninth straight 
month that sales dropped from the year-before levels, the 
association said. 
  Sales of passenger cars slumped 9.3 percent to 251,451 while 
those of trucks and buses were down 15.6 percent and 12.3 
percent, respectively, at 93,354 and 910, [as received] it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- A huge new underground 
expressway passing through such business and shopping quarters 
as Ikebukuro, Shinjuku and Shibuya in central Tokyo will be 
built within the century, officials said Wednesday [5 January]. 
Officials of the Metropolitan Expressway Public Corp. said the 
11-kilometer tunnel project, which will begin in 1995, is aimed 
at easing traffic congestion in central Tokyo. 
  This is expected to become a very hard construction project 
as the heavily populated area is patchworked with gas and water 
lines, not to mention rivers and underground railways. The 
total cost of the project has been put at some 840 billion yen. 
  About of half that amount is to be used for the purchase of 
private land, since property rights extend below the surface of 
the land. But so far the public corporation has only managed to 
buy up a fourth of the needed land. 
  The tunnel will be a spacious 40 meters wide and accommodate 
the latest fire prevention and antipollution technology.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 3 KYODO -- The Ground Staff Office of 
the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) plans to gradually reduce 
the number of regional bases by 61 to 99 from 1996 as a result 
of international situations in the post-Cold War era, the 
mass-circulation YOMIURI SHIMBUN said Monday. The GSDF's plan 
is in line with an ongoing review by the Defense Agency of the 
national defense program outline, which was drawn up in 1976 
under the Cold War confrontation, according to the YOMIURI. 
  In the review of the outline defining the nation's basic 
defense policies, the agency is considering slashing the GSDF's 
personnel from the current number of 180,000 to less than 
150,000. 
  Under the GSDF's plan, the bases in the Northern District 
Army stationed in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island, 
would be cut by 12 to 26, the daily said. 
  In accordance with reducing the number of the bases in 
Hokkaido, the divisions under the command of the Northern 
District Army would be also decreased to three from four. 
  The Northern District Army currently has the largest number 
of divisions among the GSDF's five district armies to address 
"the threat from the North," which implies a possible military 
attack by the former Soviet Union.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Vietnamese Communists Have Transported </F>
Ammunition and Tanks from Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh Through 
the Mekong River To Continue Kindling the Vietnamese War of 
Aggression Against Cambodia"] 
  [Text] According to reliable sources, 20 to 30 tanks and 
300 tons of assorted ammunition were transported from Ho Chi 
Minh City to Phnom Penh via the Mekong River. This is the plan 
of the aggressor Vietnamese communists, Vietnamese puppets, and 
their allies to continue fomenting the war in Cambodia in 
opposition to peace and the king's national reconciliation. 
  In fact, the two-heads-three-eyes government has no money to 
buy tanks, arms, and ammunition to continue the war. This is 
possible because the allies have given the money to buy 
Vietnam's ammunition and arms provided it by the former Soviet 
Union. Moreover, Vietnam wants to continue the war in Cambodia 
in line with its aggressive, annexationist, expansionist, and 
racial extermination strategy against Cambodia. Thus, (?Russia) 
is also the one who sells this ammunition, and the allies are 
the paymaster. 
  Various observers said that it is not the 
two-heads-three-eyes government but the Vietnamese communists 
and their allies who are managing Cambodia's current state 
affairs. In the two-headed government, the Vietnamese puppet 
administration set up since 1979 is controlling the countryside 
by 100 percent and 99 percent of the Phnom Penh authorities who 
are always ready to follow their boss' order. 
  The question is: Can the continuation of war by the 
Vietnamese communists solve anything? 
  1. The Vietnamese communists waged war for 13 years by 
themselves with the full support from former Eastern Europe bloc 
and former Soviet Union in an attempt to eliminate the Cambodian 
nation and people so that only the Vietnamese and Vietnamese 
puppets are left in Cambodia, but they were shamefully defeated 
by the Cambodian people. 
  2. After the Paris agreement was signed, the Vietnamese and 
their allies inside and outside UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority 
in Cambodia] jointly carried on the war for the whole two dry 
seasons and two rainy seasons that followed. They maintained 
and used the old and new communist Vietnamese troops and 
maintained all Vietnamese puppet military and civilian 
authorities. UNTAC spent almost all of the 2 billion dollars in 
attacking Democratic Kampuchea. Both the Vietnamese communists 
and their allies tried very hard, particularly on the 
battlefield, to create an administration made up of the 
Vietnamese communist half-breed and Eurasians in Cambodia. 
  At present, this half-breed government is born. That is, it 
has two heads and three eyes. But actually, it has a pure 
Vietnamese body formed by Vietnam since 1979. 
  The people said that there has never been any government 
that 
has two heads and three eyes in the history of Cambodia and that 
of the world. It is very villainous and ill-fated. Only a few 
months after its birth, it has brought calamity to the country. 
The nation and society have plunged into serious disasters in 
all fields and all aspects. The people both in rural and urban 
areas, students, pupils, civil servants, and teachers are 
revolting against the parliament and the two-head-three-eyes 
government. They are opposing the Vietnamese communist 
administrators even more violently everywhere. The people want 
only a government and a national administration that come from 
the national reconciliation policy of King Norodom Sihanouk. 
  In a situation in which the national trend and Cambodian 
people are very furious with the two-heads-three-eyes government 
and supporting the king's national reconciliation policy, will 
it be possible for the aggressor Vietnamese communists, their 
allies, and their puppets to carry on war and suppress the 
movement of the Cambodian nation and people with the weapons 
that they have just brought in? 
  The history of the Cambodian nation clearly emphasizes this 
fact to the communist Vietnamese enemy and its the allies. In 
fact, the entire Cambodian nation and people oppose the 
two-headed government, Vietnam, and the allies. The 
overwhelming majority of the puppet and Para soldiers [Son 
Sann's group] do not want to fight any longer. Therefore, can 
the weapons of the Vietnamese and their allies fight by 
themselves when the people from all social strata, particularly 
the rural people, absolutely oppose them and are tightening the 
noose around their neck. 
  This fact has been and is being confirmed by history. 
Desiring to kill a nation and people who fight for their 
national survival is not an illusion. Just take a look at the 
Cambodian countryside and at present-day Phnom Penh. Just take 
a look at Somalia, former Soviet Union, the Middle East, former 
East Europe, and present-day Africa.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta (JP) -- Minister/State Secretary 
Murdiono said yesterday that criticism directed against the 
government should not undermine the nation's stability. 
  In his first public comment about President Suharto's strong 
criticism of recent demands for greater individual freedom, 
Murdiono said no one should take stability for granted. 
  "Stability is not a self-made product and must not be taken 
for granted," he said. 
  "It is our collective responsibility to maintain the 
nation's 
dynamic stability," he told reporters after addressing a seminar 
on the cultural aspects of Indonesia's second long term 
development program yesterday. [passage omitted] 
  "I think the essence of the President's statement is that 
criticisms and statements must not undermine national 
stability," Murdiono continued. 
  "You must remember that what the President actually said was 
that their methods resembled the PKI's," he said when asked 
about the comparison. 
  The specter of the PKI, which was crushed and outlawed in 
1966 after a failed coup attempt the previous year, has often 
been raised in discussions about possible threats to national 
stability. 
  Murdiono in his paper at the seminar said that national 
stability ultimately depends on greater public participation in 
the nation's economic political and cultural development. 
  "Greater public participation will expand the state's 
political basis. This, will in turn enhance national 
stability," he said. 
  Murdiono acknowledged however that governing was not always 
a 
smooth process. "It is not realistic to expect a society to be 
free of frictions and conflicts." 
  He suggested that some kind of a limit be imposed on how far 
these conflicts could be tolerated that does not lead towards 
destruction. "To ensure that differences of opinion remain as 
constructive as possible, we should set a limit on the maximum 
conflict allowable." 
  Murdiono said the "limit" would vary according to the 
situation. 
  "This limit must be formulated and agreed upon collectively. 
It must be dynamic and dependent on both the society's 
development and the ability of the state apparatus to control 
the situation," he said. [passage omitted] 
  Twenty-one students are currently being detained for staging 
a demonstration in Jakarta last week. They are likely to be 
charged with defaming President Suharto an offense punishable by 
up to six years in jail, the police said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Education and Culture Minister Wardiman Joyonegoro 
has supported a plan initiated by ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] 
for an increased dialogue with university students so as to cope 
with protest rallies, which are likely to take place this year. 
He added that the government has always supported moves 
involving members of the public in an effort to improve the 
quality of education. The minister made the remarks to 
reporters in Jakarta yesterday in response to the ABRI's plan to 
hold discussions with students from several universities. 
  Earlier, Major General Muzani Syukur, commander of the 
Siliwangi Regional Military Command, said ABRI would hold 
persuasive discussions with university students in his 
jurisdiction. The discussions are aimed at preventing protest 
rallies from taking place this year. The move to hold 
discussions with the students is part of a package stressing the 
importance of upholding the law and making the students have a 
better understanding of national unity.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The observation of human rights in 
Indonesia this year has been poor. 
  The Indonesian Bar Association (Ikadin) in its assessment of 
legal sector development in the past 12 months found much 
lacking. 
  "Ikadin sees an erosion in the way human rights were 
respected, as exemplified by limitations and violations of the 
rights to associate and to express opinions and of the 
principles of democracy," the organization announced yesterday. 
  The statement cited the arrests and prosecution of students 
for staging demonstrations as a clear violation of the 
principles of democracy, especially the rights to express 
opinions and to have different views, which are guaranteed by 
the constitution. 
  The police are currently detaining 21 students and a human 
rights activist, who will be charged with insulting President 
Suharto, an offense punishable with six years imprisonment. 
  Ikadin noted that the authorities have detained a number of 
people without going through the proper procedures as required 
by the Criminal Code, and this, it said "is one reason for the 
decline in the integrity of the law." 
  Ikadin did not give any examples, but the authorities came 
under strong criticism, when in October, they detained nine men 
accused of murdering labor activist Marsinah. The case has 
become highly political. 
  The warrants for their arrests were not issued until after 
pressures from relatives, lawyers and wide media exposure made 
it all but impossible to delay doing so further. 
  Ikadin deplored the use of violence and intimidation against 
people who were defending their land and other legitimate 
rights. "These represented violation of the most fundamental 
human rights." 
  There have been a series of incidents pitting the 
authorities 
against the local people in land disputes. Most notable was the 
one in Nipah, on Madura Island, in September, which left four 
people dead. The military leadership was quick to remove three 
local officers, who were considered directly responsible for the 
incident. 
  The lawyers' association also deplored the bureaucratic 
obstacles imposed by the authorities for people holding 
gatherings, congresses, seminars and even anniversaries, all of 
which can only be held with permission. 
  Ikadin also noted a series of government bans, prohibiting 
certain people from appearing before academic seminars. "This is 
alone a form of suppression of the principle of campus freedom." 
  Leading human rights lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution was banned 
from appearing before two seminars this month and noted poet 
W.S. Rendra also suffered the same fate earlier on. 
  The statement, which was the result of a year-end meeting, 
was signed by Ikadin's chairman, Harjono Citrosubono, and its 
Secretary-General, Johan Jauhary. 
  Also taking part in the year-end Ikadin meeting held last 
week were E.J. Kanter, Sukarjo Adijoyo, Alie Amangku, Kitty 
Sugondo, Frans H. Winarta, Abdul Hakim Garuda Nusantara and 
Luhut M.P. Pangaribuan.

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" of interview with Monsignor Carlos Filipe Ximenes </F>
Belo, bishop of East Timor, by correspondent Yacob Herin in 
Dili; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] Question: During your trip to 
Australia, did you pass on any message to the Catholic people 
there? 
  Answer: First of all I appealed to them to remain 
Catholics. I know that many of them have quit going to church. 
In modern Australian life, people tend to forget about God. 
Secondly, I reminded them of the values of reconciliation, of 
redemption, unity, solidarity and mutual forgiveness. 
  Were the Australian people still talking about the 
human rights situation in our country? 
  Yes. They talk about it every day. They would rather I talk 
about that than about seminary matters. In the United States 
and Canada, it was the same. I got upset over there as I had not 
come to discuss human rights. My top priority was establishing 
the seminary. But the same question came up again and again, so 
when we were in Canada, the priest who was escorting us 
suggested that I talk a little bit about human rights so that 
the congregation would be inclined to donate funds (the 
bishop said this as a humorous aside). 
  So, as far as I was concerned, I did not go there for human 
rights. In Australia, to those who asked the questions I 
replied: "You already know it all." 
  Whatever happens over here, they will learn about it over 
there. It happens here in the morning, in the afternoon 
everybody knows about it over there. So, there is no point in 
trying to hide what happens over here. Although we can exercise 
censorship on the press, on the television, and although we have 
here sophisticated means to filter news, everybody will find out. 
  Were the Australians still asking about the November 
12, 1991, incident? 
  Oh, a lot was asked about it. It was a big joke in the 
cathedral as well as among the Australian press. But I told 
them I did not come for that topic. I respect those who have 
passed away, I pray for them, and I pray that such a thing will 
never happen again. What is important to me now is the future. 
I would like to forget the incident, learn from what has 
happened, prepare our young generation, and hope that this will 
never happen again. My mission is to build a young generation 
with no internal conflicts and suspicion. 
  Although these kind of things are taboos and they are not 
supposed to be discussed in public, in those countries it is an 
everyday issue. 
  So, the main problem is, in today's world we cannot hide 
anything. With the globalization we have now, we cannot hide 
anything from the world. Domestically we can suppress news, but 
not internationally. 
  What is your opinion about the situation in and the 
condition of East Timor today? 
  My impression is, the people are not 100 percent at ease 
yet. 
Not yet. Problems that emerge are usually prompted by problems 
of economy, social justice, and job opportunity. All of them. 
So, let us pay more attention to the people. Let us have more 
dialogues. 
  Security in East Timor has been achieved. In order to 
complement it, perhaps we need to foster more civilian 
diplomacy. What do you think about this? 
  Diplomacy can involve everybody: the military, civilians, 
the 
bishop, the pope, well...everybody. 
  Lately, we have seen a growing push for democratization 
in every aspect of our lives. What is your opinion? 
  Well, hopefully that is true. Hopefully the people have 
opened their eyes and their minds so that they can participate 
in the process and participate in the openness. If they have 
opinions and views to express, they should express them openly. 
Otherwise, we will become a backward nation, still feudalistic, 
still authoritarian. 
  Suppose that the democratization forces are genuine, 
does it mean that repressive practices should be reduced? 
  There should be courage to do that, yes, and I can see it. 
When I was still in Portugal, we had a fascist regime. Then a 
revolution broke out. Those from the military refused to step 
down at that time due to their vested interests. However, the 
time was for democratization in Portugal, so all of them 
eventually fell. 
  But that was OK. There should be input from all sides, from 
the press, from the people themselves. Groups should be brave 
enough not to keep on defending their own interests. In the 
Portuguese language, we have the word tacho; it connotes a 
person who has achieved a good position, has accumulated a lot 
of wealth, but then defends his personal interests as if on 
behalf of national and state interests or the necessity to 
defend the country. 
  Do you have anything to say to those who have opened 
their eyes and who have been participating in the 
democratization efforts? 
  Well... I call for them to be more courageous in pushing for 
democratization in the country. I know on campuses students 
have become more outspoken. It serves no purpose but to educate 
the people to be more mature in various aspects, such as the 
economy, politics, culture and so on. 
  Do you think that what has been taking place on 
campuses is a reflection of progress in the democratization 
efforts? 
  Well, at least there are differences in opinion, and there 
is 
the courage to state them. Could you imagine if we had to live 
in a society with no courage and no initiative...? Hopefully 
those students will become crusaders in the future. Not only 
those students, but our intellectuals, too. 
  In the efforts to bring about democracy? 
  Yes. 
  What is your expectation of the newly set up National 
Commission of Human Rights? 
  Let us give them some time. Let us wait and see how they 
accommodate the people's aspirations. Only then can we make 
comments. 
  Let us move to another topic now. It appears that 
local people have been asking for more opportunity to play a 
bigger role on the political stage. Does this mean that their 
understanding of politics has reached an advanced level? 
  I once made my comment on that. Ready or not, they should be 
given enough opportunity. We have been wondering, when will 
they be allowed to lead their own communities? Not yet ready, 
not yet stable, not yet prepared, these are always the excuses 
for not letting them do it. Consequently, the people are being 
treated like a baby who is deprived of the opportunity to 
develop psychologically. A baby, or a teenager for that matter 
should develop in all sorts of difficulty, although he may have 
to be guided all the time. [passage omitted on culture]

  [Text] Dili, East Timor (JP) -- The visit to East Timor of 
a former Portuguese general and an exiled leader of the Fretilin 
[Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor] separatist 
movement next week should not rekindle aspirations for 
Portuguese support, a military official said. 
  "The situation in East Timor is now different from the past. 
I do not think the former Fretilin president or whoever wants to 
visit there will ever be able to agitate the people," Major 
General Theo Syafei told reporters in Denpasar, Bali. 
  Theo heads the Udayana Military Command which oversees 
security in Bali, East and West Nusa Tenggara and East Timor. 
  Theo said the visit of former Fretilin leader Rogerio Lobato 
and former Portuguese general Galvao de Melo will prove that 
Indonesia has nothing to hide in East Timor. 
  That also applies to the condition of remaining Fretilin 
members, he said, adding that the armed separatist movement no 
longer poses any serious threat to security in East Timor. 
  Fretilin has been waging a guerrilla war since the decision 
of the majority of East Timorese to integrate with Indonesia in 
1976. It was dealt with a severe blow when its commander, Jose 
Alexandre "Xanana" Gusmao was arrested in November 1991. 
  Many Fretilin leaders have found sanctuary in Portugal, 
their 
former colonizer. 
  Indonesia and Portugal are still negotiating, under the UN 
auspices, to settle the East Timor question. The world body 
still regards Lisbon as the administering power of East Timor. 
  Theo said that from the visit, East Timorese opposing the 
integration will see for themselves that the Portuguese support 
the rebels have been counting on all this time is nothing but 
hollow dreams. 
  On the question of East Timorese who want to go home after 
nearly 20 years in exile, Theo said they will have difficulties 
if they want to obtain Indonesian citizenship. 
  "And if they only want to come to create disturbances in 
East 
Timor or to reincite anti-integration sentiment they will have 
to face the military," he warned. 
  Theo accused East Timorese who have spread negative 
information about Indonesia's rule in the province of having 
neglected the truth for their own personal gains. 
  Lopes da Cruz, Indonesia's special ambassador for East 
Timor, 
said earlier that Lobato and de Melo are expected to visit 
Indonesia beginning on January 4. 
  The visit follows a meeting earlier this month near London, 
where a pro-Indonesian delegation led by da Cruz met Timorese 
exiles for the first time since the integration. 
  "You could say this (visit) is part of Indonesia's 
confidence-building measures, but we want to emphasize these are 
non-political meetings," da Cruz said. 
  Lopes da Cruz said Lobato's visit to Jakarta will be the 
first such trip by a Timorese in exile to Indonesia. 
  He said de Melo will visit Dili but Lobato has yet to decide 
if he will. 
  Lobato served as minister of defense during Fretilin's brief 
rule in 1975. 
  De Melo is a leader of the newly-formed Portugal-Indonesia 
Friendship Association, whose founder, businessman Manuel Macedo 
visited Indonesia in a much publicized trip in August. 
  Indonesian officials have said they hope the Friendship 
Association will help re-open diplomatic ties between Lisbon and 
Jakarta. 
  The Portuguese daily EXPRESSO earlier this month said Lisbon 
has rejected a UN proposal that the two countries install 
diplomats in third-party embassies in each other's countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No Stepping Back"] </F>
  [Text] The initial concern that the gate of openness would 
be shut temporarily following President Suharto's stern warning 
the other day that certain elements in society have used 
communist techniques in forwarding their demands now seems to be 
groundless. The Armed Forces (ABRI) spokesman, Brigadier General 
Syarwan Hamid assured in a written announcement yesterday that 
ABRI will stick to its commitment to continue to uphold the 
policy of openness. 
  "There is no reason to step back. If openness recedes, it 
means that ABRI's dual function is failing," Syarwan Hamid said. 
He explained that the wave of criticism and demands surging as 
of late was a logical consequence of the policy of openness. In 
general, he said, the aspirations expressed are tolerable since 
they have come from a sincere wish to improve the situation. 
  However, he pointed out that there is a small group of 
people 
using methods inappropriate to our political culture, which 
focus on highly sensitive issues. In such cases, Syarwan said, 
ABRI will not tolerate their actions. "We know them well enough 
since it is always a group comprising the same people," he said. 
  Syarwan appealed to the public not to force ABRI to use 
repressive means. "There is a limit to everything, and at a 
certain point ABRI cannot turn back." 
  Therefore, he suggested that all parties apply wisdom and 
conscience in restraining themselves. "But on the whole, ABRI 
is committed to not stepping back from the openness policy. We 
are also prepared for any consequences of the policy. We are 
also committed to our role of tut wuri handayani (following 
while providing guidance)," he said. 
  In summing up, Syarwan Hamid's statement feels like a fresh 
breeze -- the kind of relief one might wish for at a desperate 
moment. From the statement, one not only derives the desired 
assurance, but feels that the words contain wisdom and sincerity 
as well. 
  Many of us may remember how a few weeks ago, a statement 
from 
Major General Sembiring Meliala caused an uproar when he hinted 
that ABRI was not happy at taking a back seat role -- tut wuri 
handayani -- which results from new directives outlined by 
President Suharto several months ago. Sembiring later explained 
that his statement was misunderstood. However that may be, many 
people continued to believe that somehow it reflected the 
majority feeling in ABRI. 
  Now, with his statement, Syarwan Hamid has indirectly 
assured 
the public that this view is untrue. 
  Frankly speaking, there is nothing wrong with ABRI's new 
role. From any possible point of view, ABRI will remain the 
backbone of our national stability. In the context of its dual 
function, apparently the time has come for ABRI to switch its 
role from that of a stabilizing agent to that of a dynamizing 
one. And to dynamize the country and the nation, ABRI is to 
stay at the back and from that position help to push forward the 
nation's democratization process. And openness is an inherent 
part of that process. 
  Thus, we heartily welcome Syarwan Hamid's statement. But we 
must also underline his point that all of us should exercise 
wisdom and restraint at all times. We have come this far and we 
surely do not want to go back into the black hole we were in 
before. Ahead of us we can see a shining bright future. And 
only if we join hands can we be sure to reach it. 
  As for the "small group" of people Syarwan referred to, such 
groups can be found in any society. We should deal with them 
wisely since, after all, they are a part of us and in a way 
those "angry young men" may serve as vanguards of our 
conscience. And in this mad, mad world, maintaining and 
protecting our integrity and our conscience is perhaps the most 
difficult task of all.

  [Text] President Suharto held talks on trade and investment 
in Indonesia this morning with Kenneth Clarke, visiting British 
chancellor of the exchequer, at Jakarta's Bina Graha 
presidential office. 
  Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the British 
minister 
quoted President Suharto as requesting Britain's assistance in 
implementing Indonesia's development projects, including the 
construction of railway tracks, expressways, liquefied natural 
gas terminals, and telecommunications facilities. The British 
minister agreed to comply with the request and said he would 
urge British companies to invest in Indonesia in order to 
fulfill the president's wish. With investments totaling about 
$2 billion, Britain is now the largest European investor and the 
third largest foreign investor in Indonesia. He noted that 
Britain is now involved in the construction of railway tracks 
linking Jakarta and Banten, which will allow for a 10-fold 
increase in the transportation of coal from Sumatera and Java. 
The minister also expressed his readiness to provide assistance 
in the construction of double railway tracks between Jakarta and 
Surabaya if the Indonesian Government so desires. 
  Also present during the talks were Saleh Afiff, state 
minister for development supervision and chairman of the

  [Excerpts] Jakarta (JP) -- Minister of Finance Mar'ie 
Muhammad says last week's GATT agreements require Indonesia to 
make structural and perhaps, even institutional adjustments to 
remain competitive in an increasingly free, open multilateral 
trading system. 
  "We are required to phase out non-tariff barriers and to 
reduce our import tariffs further," Mar'ie told attendants of 
the last session of a two day seminar yesterday. 
  The gathering was discussing the opportunities and 
challenges 
of Indonesian development within the next 2 years. 
  The minister said Indonesia has no other option but to make 
concerted efforts to strengthen the competitive edge of its 
products in terms of both prices and quality. 
  Mar'ie cited the stronger tendency towards a free open 
multilateral trading system as one of three major trends the 
country will face in the second stage of its long term, 25-year 
development program beginning in April. 
  "Economic and political issues will also be more intensively 
inter-linked," he added, citing another outstanding trend 
expected during the next 25 years. 
  The problem, according to Mar'ie, is how to reconcile the 
domestic and international parameters or yardsticks for 
assessing the results of development. 
  He acknowledged that the international yardsticks of 
development strongly influenced by the industrialized countries. 
  But he conceded that in a world that is becoming smaller due 
to information technology, international yardsticks are 
unavoidably often used to assess the development of all 
countries irrespective of the stages of development they are in. 
  Mar'ie singled out the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) forum as another development that Indonesia should 
closely monitor. 
  "I think APEC will gradually turn from a loose consultation 
forum into a more solid setting and this will naturally have an 
impact on our economy," he said. 
  The two-day seminar, organized by the Yayasan Bina 
Pembangunan [Development] foundation discussed the political, 
social, cultural and economic aspects of Indonesian development 
during the next 25 years. The speakers included three cabinet 
ministers. [passage omitted] 
  Referring briefly to the monetary sector, Mar'ie reaffirmed 
that the depreciation of the rupiah against the dollar will be 
kept in the range of three percent to five percent a year and 
the monetary expansion will be checked at 20 percent a year. 
  "I am aware that bank lending during the first semester 
(April-September) of the current fiscal year (1993/1994) has 
expanded by 14.2 percent. But I think a 20 percent monetary 
expansion is the most manageable level to fuel economic 
activities without causing excessive inflationary pressures," 
Mar'ie said.

  [Text] The seasonal rice production on 41,774 hectares of 
lowland ricefields and 10,206 hectares of highland rice in 
Saravane Province yielded only 60,000 metric tons of paddy. The 
figure represents an average of only 1.5 metric tons of paddy 
per hectare. 
  With a population of 245,000, the province will face rice 
shortages possibly from four to five months. Those living in 
mountainous areas, especially in Ta-oi and Sa-moi Districts, 
will face a rice shortage for about 10 months. 
  Agricultural service officials reported that the 1993 
provincial paddy production is low at 48 percent less than that 
of 1992, with natural disasters being blamed as its major cause. 
Severe drought during the production season damaged about 5,300 
hectares of lowland and highland rice growing areas. 
  Following such low rice production, the local provincial 
administration have encouraged people to grow dry season cash 
crops and dry season rice on 169 hectares. The areas with 
favorable conditions for these crops include 100 hectares in 
Ta-oi District, 31 in Saravane District, 27 in Khong Sedone 
District, and 11 in Vapi District. Farmers in areas without 
favorable conditions, or without irrigation, have been 
encouraged to raise as many chicken, cows, and other animals as 
they can to compensate for losses resulting from low production.

(?implementing the restructuring policy) adopted by the 4th

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In a report to the nation 
during a ceremony at Malacanang, the president revealed his 
administration's plans for this year. Ramos said that the 
government's priorities will be enhancing the delivery of 
services to the public, advancing the peace process, and 
modernization. Ramos added that the service of government 
officials will be gauged according to their actions, their 
ability to solve problems, and the implementation of new 
programs. Overall, he will give priority to five programs this 
year. 
  [Begin Ramos recording in progress, in English] ...further 
moves against criminality. Five major commitments government 
will undertake in 1994: 
  First, we will protect the gains achieved in the peace 
process so that we can finally put an end to internal armed 
conflict. As a parallel effort, we will intensify the campaign 
to uphold the rule of law so that we can reduce to the minimum 
criminality and corruption, with those in the officialdom, the 
scalawags in uniform, and row officials as priority targets. We 
will maintain industrial peace and take better care of our 
overseas contract workers. 
  Second, we will institute greater discipline in the 
management of our fiscal resources through better coordination 
of policies, programs, and projects. We will focus on the 
thorough and timely implementation of flagship programs and 
projects: Streamlining of government operations, enhanced 
private sector participation by way of various BOT 
[build-operate-transfer] schemes, and privatization of 
government projects and facilities, as well as further 
improvements in the tax effort. We will encourage more private 
investments by continuing the structural reforms we have started 
and by making our exports and other industries more globally 
competitive. 
  Third, we will provide vital infrastructure support from 
government in order to mobilize private sector participation. 
In this way, we will be able to seize more government resources 
towards the provision of basic services and direct intervention 
in the reduction of poverty. 
  Fourth, we will continue to implement our environmental 
enhancement, conservation, and protection programs to ensure 
that our development will be sustainable for the benefit of our 
future generations. This will encompass our land, sea, and air 
environment, as well as our bio-diverse ecology. 
  Fifth, we will continue to make the bureaucracy more 
responsive, more transparent, and more service-oriented. Aside 
from streamlining our operations, we will upgrade morale and 
welfare programs for public servants to increase their 
productivity and efficiency. [end recording]

  [Text] Davao, Philippines, Jan 5 (AFP) -- A missing 
American man turned up Wednesday in this southern city eight 
days after he mysteriously vanished, saying he had been 
kidnapped and robbed by gunmen, police said. 
  Scott Monroe Nelson, 55, telephoned a local newspaper from 
the nearby town of Tagum to announce that he had just been freed 
unharmed by unidentified men who snatched him in Davao on 
December 28 and freed him early Wednesday. He later arrived 
with Tagum police at the regional police headquarters in Davao, 
located about 950 kilometers (600 miles) south of Manila, to pay 
a call on officials who had been stumped by his disappearance. 
  The Houston, Texas native told police that two gunmen forced 
him into a car in Davao on December 28 and transported him 
blindfolded outside the city. He said they stripped him of 
2,200 dollars in travellers cheques, 200 dollars in cash and two 
gold rings and kept him in a windowless room until his release. 
  Police had expressed skepticism over the case when a woman 
claiming to be Nelson's girlfriend reported he had been 
kidnapped, but could not pinpoint the place where it happened. 
She also claimed Nelson had been snatched on orders of his 
estranged Filipina wife, who lived in another city. 
  "We are still investigating," police superintendent Filipino 
Amogis said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Army Commander General Wimon Wongwanit by </F>
THAI RAT political correspondent; place, date not given] 
  [Text] [THAI RAT] Will you leave your post as Army 
commander when the October 1994 military reshuffle is made? 
  [Wimon] You have to ask my superior, not me, because he can 
tell you what will happen in the reshuffle. I will not tell you 
what I have in my mind. No matter who becomes the new 
commander, he will do what I have been doing, and even better. 
I believe that the younger generations must be better than the 
old. I can prove this statement. In ancient times, people 
lived in caves. Now people live in houses. If the younger 
generations were not better than their elders, people would 
probably be living in holes in the ground. Personally speaking, 
I do not agree with one person holding two positions. 
  [THAI RAT] You have always stressed mutual affection and 
solidarity, but many people are still suspicious of soldiers. 
What type of image do you want soldiers to have? 
  [Wimon] I believe in the old saying: "Distance tests a 
horse's strength; time proves a man's heart." I have been doing 
my best, and those who distrust me will one day understand. We 
cannot force others to agree with us, because we have a 
democratic system. Everyone has his own views. Anyone with a 
fair and unbiased mind can tell whether I have done right or 
wrong. I have the answer for myself and my subordinates because 
what I have done is based on my own judgment. I am not 
disturbed by what other people think about me. But I am hurt 
when someone criticizes my institution instead of me. That is 
unfair, because the military institution belongs to the people 
of the whole Kingdom. Everyone wants it to be strong so it can 
defend our national independence and sovereignty. I welcome 
suggestions and criticisms regarding my performance. I will not 
hesitate, however, to counter any unconstructive criticisms that 
are aimed at sowing discord within the institution. I feel it 
is my responsibility. I must do my best. 
  [THAI RAT] You used to say that if the military is hit too 
hard, the soldiers might not be able to tolerate it. 
  [Wimon] I have not said this. I can tolerate it. But if 
others cannot, violence can occur. By violence, I do not mean 
that I will bring the soldiers out to do this or that. Violence 
can take the form of lawsuits. If those who have been hurt do 
not feel that they have been given justice, however, they may 
resort to other means of violence, such as dark influences, 
physical assault, or killing. I do not want to see that happen. 
Misinterpretation has damaged the military. They even say that 
the military is about to stage a coup. That is untrue. Why 
should I do that? I do not want power. I do not want to grow 
bigger than I am now. I graduated from the military academy to 
build up the Army. 
  [THAI RAT] You have declared that you will not get involved 
in politics. How sure are you that your subordinates agree with 
your firm stand? 
  [Wimon] I believe that every unit commander believes in 
democracy. We must admit that everyone loves the country. 
Every soldier has been taught to love democracy. Elections are 
not the sole ingredient of a democracy. There are many other 
factors involved. I can reaffirm that in this new era the 
soldiers are more democratic than some of the people preaching 
democracy. 
  [THAI RAT] How are the current relations between the 
military 
and the government? 
  [Wimon] I say very good, because the soldiers and the 
government are each doing their duty without interfering in each 
other's work. We receive and implement the policies the 
government has presented to National Assembly. The working 
relations between the government and the military are excellent; 
no problem at all. The government has never interfered with us. 
The government gives us their policies and we implement them 
for the sake of national security. Soldiers always comply with 
the government's policies. The government does not interfere 
with the promotion or transfer of sergeants or sub-lieutenants. 
Politicians find it unnecessary to interfere in these matters. 
I believe that we must work faithfully and honestly. 
Wrongdoers must be condemned, while those who do right must be 
respected. For the survival of our nation, we must not practice 
favoritism or think only of our personal gain. 
  [THAI RAT] Many people say that military support for this 
government is based on your personal relations with the prime 
minister. 
  [Wimon] As a matter of fact, it is the duty of the armed 
forces to support the government. Regardless of who is prime 
minister, the armed forces must comply with the government's 
policies. Prime Minister Chuan is doing his duty. He is a clean 
and honest man. I am also doing my duty. If what I have done 
brings stability to the government, then it is right. This is 
the duty of soldiers under a democratic system. I would do the 
same regardless of who heads the government. 
  [THAI RAT] How is the Army's image since the May incident? 
  [Wimon] As Army commander, I believe that unity is the 
foundation of success. If we do not join our mental and 
physical efforts, there will be no unity in the Army. When I 
was first appointed Army commander, I announced my top priority 
was to consolidate my subordinates so that they could make joint 
efforts to serve the country. At this stage, I am very proud to 
say that affection and unity prevails in the Army beyond my 
expectations. The second task is to instill among Army personnel 
the consciousness of serving the country and people at all 
costs. I am proud of being Army commander and of the sincerity 
and affection I have received. My success in the performance of 
my duty must be evaluated by the general public and mass media.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai will visit Cambodia 
next week to strengthen bilateral relations between Thailand and 
the Royal Government of Cambodia. The three-day visit, 
scheduled for 12-14 January, will be the first visit to that 
country by the prime minister. 
  Government Spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa says that Thailand 
has played a vital role in the reconstruction of Cambodia. The 
government has provided economic assistance to Thai business 
people who earlier concluded agreements with various Cambodian 
factions. Mr. Aphisit says that the ongoing fighting between the 
elected Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge will not affect 
the visit to Cambodia by Prime Minister Chuan. However, he 
says, among the neighboring countries of Cambodia, Thailand will 
be most affected by the fighting. He reaffirms that Thailand 
has always complied with the United Nations resolutions on 
Cambodia.

  [Text] Deputy labour and Social Welfare Minister Phaithun 
Kaeothong yesterday was handpicked by New Aspiration Party [NAP] 
leader Chawalit Yongchaiyut to succeed him as minister. 
  Mr Phaithun told a press conference that he would continue 
another 100-day operation plan, earlier proposed by Gen 
Chawalit, to speed up administration at the ministry. 
  Gen Chawalit yesterday asked permission from the party 
executive committee to appoint Mr Phaithun to succeed him at the 
Labour and Social Welfare Ministry. He also received permission 
to appoint or transfer party ministers before informing the 
executive committee. 
  "In any case, I can talk to the Premier to transfer NAP 
ministers without the advance permission of the executive 
committee," said the NAP leader. 
  Gen Chawalit also told the press conference that the NAP 
would cooperate with other coalition parties to improve the 
efficiency of the government.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Rush Into Financial Liberalization"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We take this opportunity to 
express a view in the interest of the country. That is, in 
accordance with the GATT accord Thailand can no longer keep its 
financial sector closed. However, we must be very careful not 
to rush to liberalize our financial sector, especially as result 
of the insistence of a superpower, because this could amount to 
liquidating our own financial institutions. 
  It is not difficult to see that the Newly Industrialized 
Countries [NIC's] --Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and 
Singapore -- and countries rapidly advancing toward the NIC 
status, and this include Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, are 
priority targets of economic superpowers who want to establish 
commercial banks and other forms of financial institutions in 
order to rake off profits. They accomplish this by virtue of 
their greater experiences in that sector. 
  Believe it or not, if the 17-19 January visit of U.S. 
Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen succeeds in the immediate 
liberalization of the Thai financial sector, Thai commercial 
banks and financial institutions could collapse or have their 
growth throttled. The superpowers' capital and global 
experience are that great. 
  We suggest the delay of our financial liberalization for as 
long as possible. The GATT accord is not be enforceable until 
1995. In particular, we must not succumb to U.S. demands. The 
United States itself stated at the signing of the agreement with 
the EEC that its own financial liberalization would not occur 
until eight months later. Even as the date for the enforcement 
of the GATT accord nears, the superpowers will try their best to 
protect their interests. [passage omitted]

  [Text] North Korean UN Ambassador Pak Kil-yon today said 
that since the U.S.-North Korean negotiation has reached a final 
stage, a final conclusion [choejong kyollon] will be made soon, 
adding that since the issue of nuclear inspection requires 
technical procedures, North Korea will be able to resolve it in 
consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
It is, therefore, expected that the IAEA's nuclear inspection 
team will visit North Korea to conduct inspections of the seven 
declared North Korean nuclear sites. However, the IAEA said 
that it has not yet been contacted by North Korea or the United 
States in connection with the inspection of the North Korean 
nuclear sites.

<F P=106> [Article by Washington-based correspondent Nam Chan-sun: </F>
"War of Nerves on `Juridical Viewpoint' of Nuclear Inspection of 
North Korea"] 
  [Text] It has been learned that there is a delicate 
difference in views between the United States and North Korea on 
the legal nature of the inspection, which is a principled and 
essential issue for the solution to the nuclear problem. Thus, 
people are paying great attention to how the difference will be 
settled in the future. 
  The difference in views between the United States and North 
Korea originated with the issue concerning the position North 
Korea is holding regarding the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
[NPT]. In other words, North Korea claims that since it is still 
in a state of "withholding the withdrawal from the NPT," it has 
no responsibility to fulfill its obligations as an NPT member. 
Based on this theory, the North Korean side says it is not in 
the position to accept regular and non-regular inspections 
prescribed in the accords of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] but would only cooperate with the United States 
for ensuring nuclear safeguards and its continuity. 
  Therefore, experts believe that such a claim made by North 
Korea is a pitfall that would be used as an excuse for North 
Korea to refuse the IAEA inspection whenever it wants or to 
restrict the scope of the inspection. 
  It has been learned, however, that North Korea is not 
opposed 
to accepting the IAEA inspection at the present stage and that 
North Korea has agreed in principle to include seven nuclear 
facilities in the IAEA inspection. 
  During the 29 December contact, North Korea proposed to hold 
nuclear negotiations with the IAEA in Pyongyang. The U.S. side, 
however, conveyed its position to discuss a detailed procedure 
in Vienna where the IAEA Secretariat is located. 
  Therefore, the issue of whether North Korea will accept the 
entire contents of ordinary inspections demanded by the IAEA or 
accept only a limited inspection or an inspection with possible 
future limitations in order to ensure nuclear safeguards and its 
continuity, as North Korea openly claimed, will be a key to 
working out a compromised plan between North Korea and the 
United States. Concerning this, White House spokeswoman Dee Dee 
Myers stressed that the United States will continue demanding 
overall inspections and revealed the position that the United 
States will not accept the proposal for a limited inspection or 
inspections that have the possibility of future limitations. 
  The New York working-level contact between North Korea and 
the United States is aimed at reaching an agreement only on the 
general direction, and the agreement on detailed issues 
including the inspection method will be made at the forthcoming 
negotiations between North Korea and the IAEA. Experts believe 
that North Korea and the IAEA will reach an agreement when the 
New York working-level contact between North Korea and the 
United States conclude. 
  Therefore, in the event that North Korea insists, in 
actuality, on a limited inspection or an inspection with the 
possibility of limits in the future, instead of a nominal 
acceptance of an inspection, only to justify its position, the 
U.S.-North Korea working-level negotiation can hardly be about 
to reach its conclusion.

  [Text] The government was learned to have recently sent a 
notice to the U.S. Embassy urging future payment of rent in 
relation to its nonpayment of rent for its building on Sejongno 
in Seoul. 
  On 5 December, the relevant government official stated: "The 
Board of Audit and Inspection pointed out in July 1993 that `for 
no valid reason, the U.S. Government has not paid rent while 
occupying the embassy building for 13 years.' Thus, the 
Ministry of Culture and Sports, which manages the Embassy 
building, sent a notice to the U.S. Embassy requesting payment 
of rent." 
  The official stated that "such steps by the government is of 
significance in clearly informing the U.S. side of our position. 
Since the issue of unpaid rent will be discussed in future 
between the ROK and the United States, details regarding this 
were left out of the notice." He added that "based on the 
principle of resolving the rent issue for the U.S. Embassy 
building in accordance with diplomatic norms and practices, the 
government asked the U.S. side for a prompt settlement, and the 
U.S. side said that it would make efforts for a solution when 
the new ambassador came into office." 
  According to the relevant government authorities, annual 
rent 
for the U.S. Embassy building is estimated at five hundred 
million won and unpaid rent for the past 13 years amounts is 
estimated to amount to 6.5 billion won. 
  The U.S. Embassy building was built in 1961 as one of twin 
buildings (the other building was formerly used by the Supreme 
Council and now houses the Ministry of Information and Ministry 
of Culture and Sports) with the ROK providing the land and $1.15 
million of the total $3.21 million in construction costs and 
with the U.S. side providing the remaining $2.02 million. The 
building stands on 6,625 square meters of land, has one 
underground floor and eight floors above the ground.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- Some 200 South Korean 
veterans of the Vietnam war have rejected an out-of-court 
settlement in their class-action suit against seven American 
chemical companies, a spokesman for the Association for Agent 
Orange Victim Veterans of the Vietnam war said Wednesday. 
  They are seeking compensation of 300 million U.S. dollars 
for 
illnesses caused by the herbicide agent orange, and were offered 
30 million dollars in August last year by the U.S. chemical 
companies, which include Dow Chemical Co. and Monsanto company. 
  Spokesman Pae Nam-su, 50, said he filed the suit against the 
seven manufacturers of the dioxin-based herbicide, widely used 
as a defoliant in the Vietnam war, in May 1993 on behalf of 204 
Korean victims in the State Court of Texas and expects the first 
hearing this April. 
  The veterans association sent a list of 100 names, including 
Pae's, who have been recognized with agent orange sequelae by 
the Patriots and Veterans Affairs Ministry, and documentary 
evidence of their service in Vietnam to American lawyers in 
March last year and sent documents on 104 additional victims in 
August. 
  The Rev. Yi Su-man, chairman of the association, said the 
chemical companies offered 30 million dollars for the estimated 
3,000 agent orange victims in Korea on line with the 
compensation paid to American victims in 1980 through the 
association's lawyer in August. 
  "But I concluded that the sum is too small considering the 
cost of treatment over the years and us being a minority race, 
and so I have refused the offer," Yi said. "Even if it takes us 
two or three years, we are determined to get every penny of the 
amount we demand," he said. 
  Six lawyers will defend the victims in the United States and 
two lawyers are offering legal advice in Seoul. 
  The Korean Veterans Association plans to file a separate 
suit 
against two American chemical companies on behalf of Korean 
agent orange victims.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Yong-tok raised the issue of human rights in North Korea on 
Wednesday, opening the possibility that Seoul will take up the 
matter with Pyongyang when inter-Korean dialogue resumes. 
  "It's about time North Korea recognized universal values, 
such as freedom, respect for human rights and welfare," Yi told 
reporters. 
  "North Korea must also ride the trend of world history for 
inter-Korean reconciliation and coprosperity, and for this we 
must tell the North Koreans things that sound harsh to their 
ears." 
  Values respected in democratic societies must also be 
respected in North Korea, said Yi, who is also unification 
minister. 
  "We must induce the North Koreans into realizing the basic 
value of respect for human rights," he said. 
  Noting that the most important human rights problem facing 
both South and North Korea is the issue of separated families, 
he said it shames the Korean people that these families still do 
not know whether their beloved are alive. 
  "Meeting itself is no longer an end in inter-Korean 
relations, and we must now make this relationship move forward 
to a higher goal," he said. "If they don't agree on our 
principle, we won't respond unconditionally to their proposal 
for a meeting. So far we've tried to bring them over to the 
meeting table and we've avoided telling them what they don't 
like to hear. But now we need to awaken them to the universal 
values of mankind, however harsh it may be to their ears."

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" from the paper: "Nuclear Disarmament and </F>
Nonproliferation in Northeast Asia" by Dr. Jan Yong-sup, aide to 
the Defense Ministry] 
  [Text] North Koreans have maintained that their nuclear 
program is solely for peaceful purposes and went a step further 
alleging that the peaceful nature of their nuclear program has 
been proved since the first IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] for ad-hoc inspection. 
  According to the North Korean Government's explanation to 
the 
IAEA, they developed spent-fuel reprocessing plant for the later 
use of fast breeder reactors or mixed oxide fuels, adding, 
however, North Korea's technological capability does not match 
with such advanced technology. 
  This can be interpreted as a groundless excuse. However, the 
experimental 5MWe reactor at Yongbyon is a graphite-moderate, 
natural-uranium-fueled and gas-cooled reactor which is more 
appropriate for generating spent fuel as quickly as possible to 
produce weapons-grade plutonium rather than for generating 
electricity. 
  North Koreans are reluctant to sign the Chemical Weapons 
Convention (CWC) because its clause pertaining to inspections 
may spill over to the nuclear issue. If they accept the CWC, 
there will be no grounds to shrink from any kind of inspections. 
  Decisions to go nuclear seem to have been made in the early 
1960s. The push for the program became more compelling in the 
late 1980s for the following reasons: North Korea's concern 
about rising costs when trying to match more advanced South 
Korean conventional weapons capabilities, its concern about 
cutbacks in Soviet arms supplies and the Kremlin's distancing 
from the North to become closer to the South, China's failure to 
provide any real substitutes and lastly the concern reinforced 
by the technologically superior U.S.-led multi-national forces 
defeating the Soviet-armed Iraqis in the Gulf war. 
  More serious is North Korea's intention to wage another war 
with nuclear weapons in an era of austerity for the North Korean 
regime which is doomed to collapse if the worst case scenario 
unfolds: to initiate a surprise attack on the South and occupy 
some territory and negotiate a surprise attack on the South and 
occupy some territory and negotiate for the termination of war, 
or to deny U.S. reinforcement by threatening to use nuclear 
weapons. 
  As we know from North Korea's behavior toward the IAEA 
inspections, its nuclear policy is no more than withholding 
information, hindering, covering up and fabricating facts. 
  The North Koreans have alleged they have extracted a tiny 
amount (gram units) of plutonium in 1990. However, they 
withheld the information as to what they have done with the 
plutonium and what they have done with the reprocessing 
capabilities since then. An analysis of the samples taken from 
the small amount of plutonium indicates large discrepancies with 
the timing and the number of batches processed. 
<H5>  Actual amount </H5>
  The discrepancies largely have to do with the actual amount 
of plutonium they have extracted. Estimates range between 8 kg 
and 24 kg. 
  North Korea's official response to the outside world about 
its nuclear weapons program is always the same: "We have no 
intentions, nor capabilities to manufacture nuclear weapons." 
  If North Korea pushes the nuclear program, the consequences 
will be significant, not being limited to the Korean Peninsula. 
The fear that the North may use nuclear weapons in war provides 
Seoul with a strong incentive to get nuclear weapons. Japan 
will hardly tolerate such a situation, either. Having advanced 
nuclear technology and a serious concern about North Korea's 
deep-strike delivery capabilities, there may be no reason for 
Japan to sit idle. 
  Though the IAEA has conducted six ad-hoc inspections on 
North 
Korean nuclear sites, it could not find out the totality of the 
North Korean nuclear program. As is known, the IAEA inspection 
regime has inherent limitations. 
  The IAEA inspections are limited to the sites declared by a 
member state. When the state itself refrains from declaring and 
identifying its secret activities, there is no effective way to 
inspect the undeclared sites as of now. 
  Though the IAEA Board of Governors already has reaffirmed 
the 
IAEA's right to request inspection to identify undeclared 
nuclear material in case there are reasons to believe such 
material exists and explanations have not clarified the matter, 
North Korea is becoming the first test case for special 
inspections. 
  Before such special inspections become institutionalized, 
there exists no effective way to prevent clandestine efforts 
under there present IAEA inspection regime to develop nuclear 
weapons despite the IAEA safeguard inspections. 
  Keeping these limitations in mind and attempting to resolve 
major discrepancies between North Korea's declaration and the 
IAEA's findings, the IAEA Board of Governors Meeting issued a 
resolution that called on the North to fully cooperate with the 
IAEA to enable the IAEA to conduct special inspections on the 
two suspect sites within one month after the adoption of the 
resolution. 
  If North Korea does not respond positively, this case may be 
brought to the U.N. Security Council after the deliberation 
process by the IAEA Board of Governors. 
  If the IAEA and South Korea do not succeed in preventing the 
North Korean nuclear program within a short period of time, then 
vocal sentiments inside South Korean may rise to reconsider the 
policy of not developing nuclear reprocessing and uranium 
enrichment capabilities. Even more serious is the possibility of 
going nuclear.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu Yong-ku and O Yong-hwan: "How Will North </F>
Korea Change in the New Year?"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Power Structure </H5>
  The matter of greatest interest regarding the change in the 
power structure expected to take place this year in North Korea 
is Kim Chong-il's succession to power. The year of 1994 will 
mark 20 years since Kim Chong-il was nominated as the successor 
in the plenary session of the Workers' Party Central Committee 
in February 1974. This also attracts the people's attention. 
  In view of the importance attached to the so-called "cyclic 
year" -- such as the 10th and the 20th year -- in North Korea, 
it is likely that visible steps for settlement of succession to 
power will be taken this year. This speculation is also 
supported by the step-by-step measures taken each year since 
1991 for Kim Chong-il's succession to power, including his 
successive nomination as the supreme commander of the military, 
marshal, and chairman of the National Defense Committee. If 
step-by-step measures are not taken this year regarding 
succession to power, it could mean that an abnormal front [isang 
chonson] might have been created within the North Korean power 
structure. 
  People observe that at least one of the titles retained by 
Kim Il-song at present, including general secretary of the 
party, chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, and 
the president of the state, will be transferred to Kim Chong-il 
this year, and complete succession to power, including transfer 
of the remaining titles, will be finalized in late 1995 or 
thereafter. 
  This observation is supported by the fact that North Korea 
has designated 1995 as "the year for reunification," that North 
Korea would require an overall evaluation of its decision to 
designate the upcoming two and three years as an adjustment 
period, and that Kim Il-song demonstrated his health by giving 
on-the-spot guidances more than 10 times last year. 
  Therefore, it appears that this year the title of either 
president of the state or chairman of the party's Central 
Military Commission will be transferred to Kim Chong-il, while 
succession to the position of general secretary of the party 
will be somewhat delayed in view of the characteristic nature of 
the socialist state. 
  The possibility of early succession to the presidency was 
predicted in 1992 through the revised Constitution, which 
abolished the regulation stipulating that the president hold the 
additional post of chairman of the National Defense Commission 
and which prescribed that the president's responsibility may be 
reviewed at the Supreme People's Assembly. As a result of this, 
the president's power was drastically reduced. This may be 
construed to be a step- by-step measure for Kim Chong-il to 
advance toward the position of president from chairmanship of 
the National Defense Committee. 
  There has also been speculation regarding succession to the 
post of chairman of the party's Central Military Commission. 
The party's rules stipulate, however, that the general 
secretary hold the additional post of chairman of the Central 
Military Commission. Therefore, in order to realize the 
succession, the step to separate the two positions must be taken 
by first revising the party's rules. 
  Last year, senior officials, including O Chin-u, Choe Kwang, 
Yi Chong-ok, Pak Song-chol, Kim Yong-chu, and Kim Pyong-sik, 
either retained their incumbent positions or were newly 
appointed. It is anticipated, however, that a fierce whirlpool 
of generational shifts will sweep North Korea at the end of this 
year. 
  The generational shift will be carried out in such a manner 
to support Kim Chong-il's succession to power. It is highly 
likely that Kim Tal-hyon and Kim Yong-sun, who were demoted, 
will be reinstated; and Kim Ki-nam, Kim Kuk-tae, Chang Song-tae, 
and the like, who are close associates of Kim Chong-il, will 
appear at the forefront during the shift. 
  If the nuclear problem is not satisfactorily solved and the 
economic crisis persists, succession to power and the 
generational shift will face serious trials. 
<H5>  Nuclear Issue and Diplomacy </H5>
  The North Korean nuclear issue is the core for maintaining 
the system and for defining economic problems. 
  Through the drastic measure of withdrawing from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], North Korea is attempting to 
ensure maintenance of its political system and to secure 
economic assistance. 
  It seems that the North Korean nuclear problem, which was 
the 
main cause of deadlock in North-South relations last year, will 
be settled this year in some form. There is great possibility 
that North Korea, which is now standing on the crossroads of its 
decision to advance toward nuclear weapons development or to 
ensure its nuclear transparency, will undertake a policy of 
ensuring its nuclear transparency. 
  As the NPT will be revised in 1995, the policy for 
international denuclearization will likely be strengthened, and 
North Korea's nuclear development will only cause its own 
isolation by going against the trend of the time after the end 
of the cold war. 
  North Korea's choice to ensure nuclear transparency will be 
made in expectation of maintaining its system. This choice may 
give rise to discord within North Korea's power structure. Even 
if North Korea makes this choice, the North Korean nuclear issue 
will enter into other aspects if the quantity of extracted 
plutonium proves to be more than expected as the result of 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections. In this 
case, concealment of plutonium will be the point of dispute and 
North Korea and the international community will again wrangle 
with each other. 
  In the event North Korea accepts complete nuclear inspection 
of the seven nuclear facilities it reported to the IAEA, North 
Korea-U.S. relations will begin to improve above all and 
negotiations between North Korea and Japan for establishment of 
diplomatic relations will be resumed. 
  The first step in improving U.S.-North Korean relations will 
be the lifting of the U.S. embargo against North Korea; even the 
mutual exchange of liaison missions will be realized between 
North Korea and the United States. 
  The negotiations for establishing diplomatic relations with 
Japan, held over eight times in the past, will be resumed and 
will make noticeable progress. 
  This is because the pro-North Korean Japanese Social 
Democratic Party has the majority of seats in the Hosokawa 
coalition cabinet and because North Korea is in need of 
reparations from Japan to overcome its economic difficulties. 
  In the meantime, North Korea will likely strive to improve 
relations with China and Russia, its traditional allies, and to 
emphasize economic diplomacy with oil producing countries 
including Iran and Libya. 
  At the same time, North Korea will continue pushing for 
nonaligned diplomacy with third world countries, including those 
in Southeast Asia and Latin America. 
<H5>  Economy and Society </H5>
  It appears that this year North Korea will unlock the gate 
of 
its economy externally, while internally it will attempt to 
further strengthen the control of people in order to maintain 
its political system, thus implementing two contradictory 
policies. 
  In view of its outdated production facilities and backward 
technology, the North Korean economic index will not likely show 
noticeable growth this year. 
  Improvement in U.S.-North Korean relations following 
solution 
to the nuclear problem, however, will bring about a stable 
supply of foodstuffs and oil, as well as a reduction in defense 
expenses, thus serving as a new factor for invigorating its 
economy. 
  It is expected that this year North Korea will, for the 
first 
time, induce foreign capital to Najin-Sonbong free trade zone as 
part of its external opening up. North Korea will also likely 
induce foreign investments for developing sight-seeing resources 
in the Mt. Paektu and Mt. Kumgang areas. It is presumed, 
however, that North Korea will decide on the opening of Nampo 
industrial zone and the like after analyzing the result of 
development of Najin-Sonbong district. 
  It is clear that North Korea will accelerate external trade 
following declaration of the trade-first policy and will 
diversify its markets by extending to Europe, Taiwan, and 
Southeast Asia. Needless to say, North Korea will direct its 
efforts on restoring normal economic relations with China, 
Russia, and Iran with a view to securing a stable supply of 
foodstuffs and oil. However, such a limited opening up will 
work as an occasion to strengthen the control of people in a bid 
to maintain the system, because North Korea has learned a lesson 
from Eastern Europe that opening up should not be allowed to be 
a factor for collapse of the system. 
  Therefore, North Korea will allow only the people whose 
so-called identities and status are reliable, to move in the 
Najin-Sonbong district, which will be opened as a free trade 
zone; and ideological indoctrination among the residents will be 
intensified more than ever before. 
  North Korea's emphasis on national tradition by unearthing 
the Tangun Tomb and dealing with the issue of national cultural 
inheritance as the first agenda item at the Supreme People's 
Assembly held in December 1993 can be regarded as a signal of 
strengthening the ideological control of the people. 
  Such indications were also noted during the Korean 
intellectuals' rally held in late 1992 at which the laws on 
opening were revised, and during the rally of forerunners with 
beautiful communist traits held last December at which the 
trade-first policy was declared. In spite of such intensified 
internal control in North Korea, this year will be the first 
year of substantive changes in North Korean residents' 
consciousness. 
  This is because frequent exchanges with the West after 
declaring the trade-first policy and the limited economic 
opening up will inevitably result in changes in residents' 
consciousness. 
  The success of the control of North Korean residents in the 
midst of the policy of limited opening up will be a key to 
choosing opening up or self-reliance.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
will make overseas trips this year to Russia, Japan and 
Southeast Asia while receiving a Chinese leader, possibly 
President Jiang Zemin, officials said Wednesday. Kim has 
standing invitations from both Moscow and Tokyo, and a trip to 
Russia is possible in the first half of the year since President 
Boris Yeltsin is expected to name his new cabinet next week. 
  "Even considering the necessary preparation time after that, 
the Russian visit is possible within the first six months," one 
official said. 
  A tour of Malaysia, Singapore and other members of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be arranged 
more matter-of-factly around Kim's attendance at the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Indonesia in 
November. His trip to Japan will be scheduled between the 
Russian and ASEAN visits, anytime from July to September, the 
official said. 
  Kim will receive a visit by either Jiang or Prime Minister 
Li 
Peng, who will return the call by Kim's predecessor, No Tae-u. 
  Kim, to show his priority on domestic affairs, left the 
country just once during his first 10 months in office, for the 
APEC meeting in Seattle followed by a summit with U.S. President 
Bill Clinton.

  [Text] Russia has been learned to be looking into ways of 
coordinating tripartite cooperation between the ROK, North 
Korea, and itself. 
  According to Russia's Foreign Ministry report on tripartite 
trade obtained by a Moscow-based trade authority of the Korea 
Trade Promotion Corporation [Kotra] on 3 January, Russia is 
seeking to form a tripartite trading system coordinating 
Russia's resources, the ROK's capital, and North Korea's labor. 
  The source says that Russia is studying the possibility of 
tripartite cooperation in 17 projects, including the development 
of Russia's iron mines and energy resources and the 
reconstruction of a railway traversing the Korean peninsula 
vertically. 
  Particularly, Russia assesses that it will take the helm in 
tripartite cooperation. In other words, Russia believes that it 
can play the role of mediator for dialogue if North Korea 
rejects cooperation with the ROK. 
  The reconstruction and joint operation of a railway 
traversing the Korean peninsula vertically is one of the 
tripartite cooperation projects Russia is now considering. In 
this project, the ROK is supposed to provide financial 
assistance and Russia is to provide locomotives and 
transportation machinery. 
  The tripartite cooperation projects also include a plan to 
develop the Tuman River basin as a center of traffic, where sea 
routes linking Russia's Far East ports and ROK ports with the 
trans-Siberian railway converge. This plan will be promoted in 
connection with the Tuman River development plan. 
  Furthermore, while reviewing a plan to offer markets to 
North 
Korea in order to enhance the operation rate of its light 
industry, Russia is planning to offer the ROK raw and subsidiary 
materials. 
  Russia hopes to modernize plants and to build new production 
lines with ROK finances, facilities and technology while it 
supervises facilities and provides concrete designs for North 
Korea's nonferrous metals, shipbuilding, train and 
transportation equipment, ship repairing, construction 
materials, and light industries. 
  At the same time, Russia is also looking for ways to 
coordinate North Korean labor and ROK capital and equipment in 
its development of agriculture, forestry, fishery, coal 
industry, energy resources, and iron mines. Russia desires the 
participation of ROK construction companies in the construction 
of energy, petrochemical, and electric appliance production 
bases in its Far East and Siberia. It may compensate North Korea 
in cash or barter trade. 
  Regarding this, Kotra said, "It is difficult to put the 
tripartite cooperation into practice now, but an environment for 
this is maturing." He then added, "The ROK needs to prepare for 
this, and establishing a special body, such as an 
ROK-Russia-North Korea intergovernmental advisory committee for 
promoting cooperation projects, may be worthwhile.

  [Text] Pusan, Jan 4 (YONHAP) -- The Russian Government will 
toughen its regulations on tax-exempt goods brought in by 
Russian hawkers this year, dealing a heavy blow to traders in 
Pusan, the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) said Tuesday. As 
hawkers bring in more and more goods, Moscow has decided to 
lower the duty-free limit to 2,000 U.S. dollars per person from 
5,000 dollars. 
  The decision is expected to deal a heavy blow to traders in 
Pusan and other international marketplaces, who have prospered 
from their dealings with Russian peddlers over the last three 
years, officials at KOTRA's Pusan branch said. 
  Russian sailors and traders have been top customers in the 
southern port since Seoul and Moscow normalized diplomatic ties 
in 1991 and their purchases from the so-called Texas market of 
such necessities as refrigerators and bread are worth 10 billion 
won (12.3 million dollars) a month, the officials said. Texas 
market in eastern Pusan hired Russian-speaking students and 
ethnic Koreans from Sakhalin early last year and set up shops 
exclusively for Russians to meet the growing demand.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- Korea will join the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
maritime transport committee as an observer this year in an 
effort to actively cope with world maritime market opening, the 
Korea Maritime and Port Administration (KMPA) said Tuesday. 
  Korea will become a committee member in 1996, when 
negotiations for opening the world maritime market wrap up, 
according to KMPA officials. 
  KMPA will hold a public hearing either next month or March 
with maritime-related organizations, including the Korea 
Shipowners' Association, to collect opinions from businesses and 
research institutes, and establish an OECD maritime information 
center at the Korea Maritime Institute to gather information. 
  Joining the committee will enable the government to 
coordinate its maritime policy with major maritime countries and 
considerably reduce friction with them. 
  The government will be able to apply pressure through the 
committee on countries with protectionist policies, enhancing 
the international competitiveness of the Korean maritime 
industry, the officials said. However, Korea will experience 
various difficulties following the joining. 
  The government will have to repeal protectionist systems, 
including obligatory use of Korean freighters for designated 
cargoes, ahead of schedule and allow foreign advances into the 
domestic maritime transportation sector. 
  The OECD Maritime Transport Committee was established in 
1961 
to contribute to promoting international trade through free and 
fair sea transportation, and 24 countries, including the United 
States, Japan, Britain and New Zealand, have joined the 
committee so far.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- Exports to Latin America 
fell last year for the first time since 1987, the Korea Foreign 
Trade Association (KFTA) said Wednesday. 
  January-November exports to the region of 4.49 billion U.S. 
dollars were off 0.7 percent from the same period in 1992. 
  Exports, which rose between 20 percent and 50 percent a 
month 
in the first half except for March, dropped 9.2 percent in 
August, 25.9 percent in September, 20.1 percent in October and 
21.8 percent in November. 
  Exports to Latin America rose between 20 percent and 30 
percent a year from 1987 and 72.4 percent in 1992. 
  The decline was attributed to economic recession in Brazil, 
Chile and Mexico. 
  The Latin American countries lowered tariffs in trade with 
the United States under bilateral agreements but raised tariffs 
in trade with Asian countries to keep out low-priced Asian 
products, officials said. 
  During the first half, Korean exports to Brazil rose more 
than 200 percent a month, but the growth rate plummeted to 
around 100 percent in the second half as Brazil tried to reduce 
imports due to worsening inflation. 
  Exports to Chile dropped for four months in a row from 
August 
to November. Exports to Mexico declined due to economic 
slackness and anti-dumping charges against Korean steel 
products, officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- Yukong Ltd. has initiated 
a project to build an oil refinery with a daily output of 
100,000 barrels in Shenzhen in China's Guangdong Province in 
joint venture with the China National Petrochemical Corp. 
(SINOPEC), a company spokesman said Tuesday. A team from Yukong 
and a Luoyang design company have begun a feasibility study for 
the project, worth 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, the spokesman said. 
  The study is scheduled to end in March, and if the result is 
favorable Yukong will apply for joint-venture approval from the 
Shenzhen authorities and begin construction in the second half 
of the year for completion by late 1997, he said. 
  Yukong and SINOPEC agreed to form a locally incorporated 
joint venture capitalized at 375 million dollars, or 25 percent 
of the total estimated investment of 1.5 billion dollars. If 
the refinery is a success, Yukong hopes to build a plant to 
manufacture petrochemical products with the naphtha it produces. 
  SINOPEC and Yukong will put up 60 percent and 40 percent of 
the capital, respectively, and borrow other funds on the 
international financial market using the refinery as collateral, 
the spokesman said. 
  Of the petrochemical products, 80 percent will be sold in 
China and 20 percent exported to Southeast Asia.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said on Wednesday afternoon that his government will manage 
state affairs this year with an emphasis on economy. 
  "We will turn the challenges of internationalization and 
opening into an oppportunity for us to build up our 
international competitiveness and carry on the new five-year 
economic plan consistently," the president said. 
  Noting that a silent economic revolution is sweeping the 
world, President Kim said only capable countries and industries 
can survive in the whirlwind. 
  The president was speeking at a new year reception hosted by 
the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry at the Sejong 
Cultural Center. 
  He said he would keep by all means the promise to make South 
Korea a country most ideal for industrial activities. "The 
government in its part will assure industries their free 
business activities to the most possible extent," Kim said. 
  Calling on industries to invest now, the president said that 
only those industries that make bold investment now braving a 
little uncertainty can survive. 
  He said the Korean economy has visibly improved since the 
third quarter of 1993 and is now in the stage of recovery, 
adding that trade has recorded a surplus for the first time in 
four years. 
  "Since this year would become a significant period in 
deciding the fate of Korea in the 21st century, we must cope 
with all challenges lying ahead [of] us with firm confidence," 
President Kim said.

  [Text] It was learned on 4 December that the Foreign 
Ministry plans to drastically reorganize its structure, so that 
a new Diplomatic Intelligence Bureau for the systematic 
management of industry and technological intelligence on 
advanced nations and a new Science and Environment Bureau is 
established. 
  With a view to enhancing efficiency in personnel management, 
the Foreign Ministry also plans to degrade 17 of 47 vice 
minister-level special first-class grade officials to a lower 
first-class grade, and to readjust its overseas missions. 
  The Foreign Ministry will readjust the diplomatic 
organizational network that was established at random in an era 
of confrontational diplomacy between the North and the South. 
It will close down some of its missions in Africa, Latin 
America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe and augment others 
to carry out additional functions.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Forestry 
Administrator Pak Sang-u was named first assistant agriculture, 
forestry, and fisheries minister and Chief Judge of the National 
Tax Tribunal Yi Kun-yong was named assistant finance minister 
for tax affairs in a reshuffle Wednesday. 
  Assistant First State Minister for Political Affairs An 
Kyong-chin and Second State Minister for Political Affairs Chong 
Chin-yong changed places as a result of the recent discovery 
that An is a brother-in-law of First State Minister for 
Political Affairs So Chong-won. 
  An, who is seven years older than his new boss, married So's 
elder sister while he was in the Home Affairs Ministry. So was 
then studying politics and diplomacy at Chungang University. 
  Born in Wonju, Kangwon Province, An served as deputy 
governor 
of Kangwon and director-general of the civil defense 
headquarters before settling in at the Ministry of Political 
Affairs I in 1991. 
  He said he had never dreamed his brother-in-law, a 
Democratic 
Liberal Party lawmaker and close aide to President Kim Yong-sam, 
would become his superior. 
  The "too-close-for-comfort" partnership lasted 15 days, 
until 
An was made to change seats with Chong of the Ministry of 
Political Affairs II on Wednesday. 
  "Never was there a case when brothers-in-law worked in the 
same office with the superiority order reversed," a ministry 
official noted, adding that although An had reason to be 
uncomfortable he did not show it.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- Former Defense Minister 
Kwon Yong-hae and Former Defense Security Commander Kim To-yun 
have been cleared of suspicion in the 6.7 million-U.S.-dollar 
arms scam on the basis of their statements, the joint 
military-prosecution investigative team said Wednesday. 
  The team found no evidence of a cover-up or connivance at 
the 
fraud in its questioning of the two former defense officials 
Tuesday night, a team spokesman said. 
  Kwon told investigators that he first received a report on 
the scam from his law officer on July 28, and then from the 
defense logistics agency director on Aug. 6, which agreed with 
statements given by others, the spokesman said. 
  Kim said that he did not forward a July 23 report on the 
scam 
from his man attached to the Defense Ministry to Minister Kwon 
because Kwon was supposed to receive the report from his law 
officer and the Defense Logistics Agency director, which the 
team spokesman said cleared him of the suspicion that he had 
hidden the fraud from the defense minister. 
  There is no evidence that the Defense Ministry leadership 
tried to cover up the case, he said, the swindle involved only 
French arms dealer Jean-Rene Fuan and his Korean agent, Chu 
Kwang-yong. 
  Not cleared, however, is Yang Kyu-sok, 45, operations 
officer 
of United Shipping Co., who was arrested on charges of issuing a 
phoney bill of lading to Chu in return for a 5 million-won bribe. 
  Yang is charged with forging a bill of lading issued by 
Dutch 
shipping firm shipcraft for shipment of 40,000 rounds of 90mm 
recoilless rifle ammunition worth 1.3 billion won. On the 
strength of this forged shipping document, Chu and fuan withdrew 
payment for the non-existent ammunition from the Korea Exchange 
Bank's Paris Branch in April 1991.

  [Text] There is a shortage of personnel at quarantine 
stations responsible for the examination of agricultural 
chemicals in imported foodstuffs. In particular, the 
examination functions have been divided between the Ministry of 
Health and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Fisheries, and effective examinations have not been conducted. 
Reporter Hwang Song-su reports: 
  [Begin Hwang Song-su recording] These are imported farm 
products waiting for clearance in a bonded warehouse in Inchon 
port [video shows various farm products]. Approximately 7,600 
kinds of farming products were cleared through the Inchon 
quarantine station last year, up 25 percent compared with 1992. 
[end recording] 
  [Begin Inchon quarantine port official Kim Sung-kyom 
recording] Most farm products have been imported from China. We 
cannot conduct thorough examinations of agricultural chemicals 
in imported foodstuffs. Thus, we are in a position of looking 
into 10 or 20 boxes at most a day to examine for agricultural 
chemicals. [end recording] 
  [Begin Hwang recording] To effectively quarantine the 
increased number of agricultural and stockbreeding products that 
will start with the import-opening era, the Ministry of Health 
and Social Affairs will expand from 38 to 105 the number of 
agricultural products that will require examination for 
agricultural chemicals. In particular, to cope with imported 
agricultural products, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs 
will increase from 24 to 58 the number of grains, including 
rice, that will be required to be examined. However, there are 
only 7 inspectors at Inchon quarantine port out of a total of 37 
called for. The situation is the same at other quarantine 
stations. [end recording] 
  [Begin recording of Yi Chae-kwan, section chief of 
foodstuffs 
circulation department under the Ministry of Health and Social 
Affairs] We have demanded that the number of personnel in 
charge of close examination be increased to 265. The Ministry 
of Government Administration is now considering the personnel 
increase. We judge that if the number of personnel is 
increased, control of all imported foodstuffs will be properly 
examined. [end recording] 
  [Begin Hwang recording] In particular, quarantine functions 
in our country have been divided. That is, the national 
quarantine station affiliated with the Ministry of Health and 
Social Affairs conducts the sanitary examination of imported 
agricultural and stockbreeding products. The animal quarantine 
station and plant quarantine station affiliated with the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have conducted quarantine 
tasks. Effective examination has not been conducted. [end

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- Korean scientists have 
developed the first notebook computer to run both Apple and 
Microsoft Operating Systems, according to the Science and 
Technology Ministry Tuesday. 
  Newtech Z II, a private computer research institute, built 
the dual-microprocessor, dual-Operating System (O/S) Notebook in 
a state-promoted "medium-tech" project over five months at a 
cost of 1.2 billion won (1.4 million U.S. dollars), of which 750 
million won was put up by the ministry. 
  The world personal computer market is mostly divided between 
IBM and IBM-compatible microcomputers and Apple microcomputers, 
and attempts have long been made to make the two compatible. 
  "Computer users can now have an IBM PC and Macintosh O/S on 
the same computer," institute President Chong Chan-ik told 
reporters. 
  The notebook has both an Intel 486-DX CPU (Central 
Processing 
Unit) and a Motorola 68030 CPU, which work together through four 
home-grown chips. 
  The institute will complete a prototype by end of January 
for 
introduction at an international computer show in Hannover, 
Germany, in March. 
  Production of the dual O/S Notebooks is due to begin in June 
to export 100,000 units, Chong said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's 
semiconductor industry, which soared on the wings of 4 
megabyte-dynamic random access memory [dram] chips last year, 
will switch its production lines over to 16 M-dram chips this 
year. The big three -- Samsung Electronics Co., Goldstar 
Electron, and Hyundai Electronics Ind. Co. -- will complete 
facility improvements by June and expect 16 M-dram chips to 
completely replace 4 M-dram chips on the world market this year. 
A 16 M-dram is a high value-added product with an export price 
of 70 U.S. dollars compared with a 12 dollars for a 4 M-dram 
chip. 
  Samsung began mass production of 16 M-dram chips last year 
and exported 1 million in December, but it will expand the 
production line to increase capacity to 6 million chips a month. 
Samsung, already ahead of Japanese semiconductor makers in mass 
production, says that it expects to supply about 30 percent of 
the world demand for the 16 M-dram chips this year. 
  Goldstar will invest 500 billion won (618.8 million U.S. 
dollars) in its 16 M-dram production line, which it plans to 
have turning out 2 million chips a month from June, while 
Hyundai will put 800 million won into construction of a plant to 
produce up to 4 million chips a month from April. 
  An official at the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said 
on Wednesday that he expected Korea's semiconductor exports to 
reach 10 billion dollars this year. 
  "In the third quarter of the year, exports of 4 M-dram and 
16 
M-dram chips will be about equal in quantity, but most Korean 
semiconductor exports will be 16 M-dram chips by the end of the 
year," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- South Korea received the 
most orders for new ships last year, surpassing Japan for the 
first time, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported Wednesday. 
  Korea received orders for 9 million tons of shipping, or 40 
percent of the world's total of 20 million tons, compared to 6.5 
million tons, or 32 percent, for Japan, the economic daily said. 
But Japan was first for the 37th consecutive year in volume of 
ships built at about 7.5 million tons, compared with 4.5 million 
to 5 million tons for Korea. 
  According to Lloyd's register of shipbuilding, Korea began 
its climb to the top with 5.73 million tons of orders in 1990, 
when it surpassed 5 million tons for the first time. 
  The newspaper attributed Korea's jump in volume of orders to 
the strong Japanese yen and weak Korean won, which enabled 
Korean yards to rapidly increase orders for ships to be 
completed in one or two years. 
  The Japanese Shipbuilders' Association said that Japan will 
retain first place in actual volume of ships built because it 
has much more capacity than Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- South Korean construction 
companies gained 96 overseas orders worth 5.11 billion U.S. 
dollars last year, up 83.9 percent from 74 worth 2.78 billion 
dollars in 1992, the Construction Ministry said Tuesday.

communist countries and Southwest Asia, according to the 
ministry. 
  Southeast Asian countries placed orders worth a total of 
2.58 
billion dollars, or 50 percent of the overseas orders, followed 
by Middle Eastern nations at 1.81 billion dollars, up 319 
percent from 1992. 
  Former and present communist countries such as Russia and 
Vietnam placed orders of 684 million dollars. 
  Engineering work accounted for 2.31 billion dollars, or 45 
percent, and construction work for 1.62 billion dollars. 
  By company, Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co. ranked 
first at 1.3 billion dollars, followed by Dong Ah Construction 
Co. at 1.19 billion dollars and Daewoo Engineering Co. at 628 
million dollars. 
  Major contracts include Hyundai engineering's airport

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Prominent and obvious achievements obtained by 
Vietnam in 1993 were recognized by the world. In addition, it 
is an undeniable fact that human rights have been ensured and 
improved. For the Vietnamese people, the rights to live in 
independence and freedom are the biggest, a lesson drawn from 
the country's reality over the past half century. However, all 
the Vietnamese people are fully aware that independence and 
freedom will have no significance if they live in poverty, 
ignorance, and a minimally developed society. 
  An independent and free country should closely links with 
ideas of prosperous people and a mighty nation [sentence as 
heard]. That is why the renovation process has been fully 
responded by the people. The people's rights to live, first of 
all, is the right to do business. It is safe to say that never 
before the Vietnamese people are doing business as dynamically 
as today. They have engaged in diversified jobs in different 
branches. Life of the people in different quarters is better. 
However, a part of the people still lead a difficult life for 
they cannot adapt to the mechanism of market economy. To be 
fair, the people's rights to do business have been strongly 
assisted by a number of state encouraged policies. Democracy 
has worked in many fields and it showed that human rights have 
been respected. 
  National Assembly deputies and relevant government officials 
have been directly and frankly questioned about the standstill 
and negative practices in their branches or ministries. The 
Minister of Education and Training openly talked with students 
about issues of their concern. Mass media has disclosed cases 
of corruption and smuggling in different ministries and 
branches, including senior officials and so forth. Perhaps 
never before the Vietnamese people have followed closely the 
mass media as today, because they not only need information but 
also want to know the implementation of human rights and the 
national renovation process. 
  Last year, the Vietnamese state continued to issue policies 
and guidelines in order to substantially ensuring the citizen's 
rights. Now, the number of Vietnamese people going to foreign 
countries as tourists is on the increase. They not only go to 
regional countries but also to far away countries such as Hong 
Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, U.S.A., Canada, and Australia where 
in the part were considered forbidden land. 
  An ordinance on the marriage of Vietnamese citizens with 
foreigners has been issued. Freedom of belief has been written 
in the Constitution. It is complemented by mamy concrete 
resolutions. Worthy of note was the movement on eradicating 
hunger and eliminating poverty which has been largely deployed 
in the whole country. Many efforts have been made to help poor 
farmers develop production and to assist supportless aged 
people, war invalids, disable people, and orphans. 
  However, the Vietnamese state acknowledged that it does not 
complete the task in fully implementing its policies for the 
people. There remain many social evils, even serious ones. But 
it can be affirmed that the Vietnamese state has strived to 
remove difficulties for every people, every family, and increase 
their joy and confidence. That is why the people share the same 
view to build and establish a democratic society because it 
ensures human rights.

  [Text] Looking back to 1993, Vietnam and China are very 
happy to see that their traditional friendship and cooperation 
have developed in the new situation. Relations between the two 
countries have been based on the principles of respect for each 
other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, nonviolation and 
noninterference in each other's internal affairs for mutual 
equality and peaceful coexistence. 
  Progresses have been achieved in many fields since the 
normalization of relations between Vietnam and China. High-level 
meetings and exchanges of delegations from different branches 
and levels were organized. The official visit to China of 
Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh in last November marks a new 
step in the neighborly friendship relations and cooperation 
between the two countries. This visit was of great significance 
in strengthening the mutual understanding and reliability as 
well as in consolidating the time-honored Sino-Vietnamese 
friendship and cooperation. 
  Up until now, 50 agreements have been signed in order to 
resume and step by step develop economy, commerce, science and 
technology, culture, education, aviation, maritime, and post. 
  Basing on the Sino-Vietnamese joint communiques in November 
1991 and December 1992, the two sides held negotiations at 
experts and state-levels. It was worthy of note that in October 
last, the two countries signed an agreement on main principles 
for the settlement of territorial issue, to accelerate 
negotiations for the early conclusion of basic treaties on 
territorial border, on land, and sea between the two countries. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong held that the signing 
of 
this agreement was an ensuring step in solving the border issue 
between the two countries and in contributing to promoting the 
friendship relations and cooperation between the two countries 
in the interest of the two peoples as well as of peace, 
stability, and cooperation in the region. 
  For his part, Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister (Hang Jiazuan) 
noted that this was an important step creating conditions for 
the settlement of pending territorial border between Vietnam and 
China and for the further development of bilateral relations. 
  Reality has shown that the two peoples of Vietnam and China 
want to build the Sino-Vietnamese border into one of peace, 
stability, and friendship. Now the two countries are 
implementing the already signed agreement. China promised to 
help Vietnam build a factory to produce chemical fertilzer and 
small and medium-size hydroelectric power plants. In trading, 
China wanted to buy Vietnam's coal, crude oil, rubber, and sea 
products and to export to Vietnam its equipment and other 
commodity goods. 
  Vietnam and China have carried out an agreement on aviation 
and promoted an agreement on investment protection. 
  Though relations between the two countries have been 
restored 
and developed, thus bringing about the benefit for both sides 
and contributing to peace, stability and cooperation in the 
region, the two countries recongized that some agreements have 
been carried out very slowly. Vietnam and China understood that 
economic and trade relations between the two countries have not 
yet been developed according to each other's potentials as well 
as their peoples' will. 
  Both Vietnamese and Chinese peoples want to further promote 
stable, long-term, and effective friendship and cooperation and 
good neighborliness. 
  Over the past years, the two sides also saw those issues 
left 
behind by history and newly-appeared issues must be settled by 
peaceful means. The two sides agreed neither to use force nor 
threaten to use force or any actions to make the situation more 
complicated. 
  Peoples of both China and Vietnam hope that with their 
time-honored traditional friendship and cooperation and the 
developments in the past year, the Sino-Vietnamese relations 
will further be upgraded effectively in many fields.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Nineteen Ninety Three marked a breakthrough in the 
cooperation between Vietnam and the European Community. Here is 
our comment on the issue: 
  The most important event in the Vietnamese-European 
Community 
is the official visit by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
to some EC countries in early July 1993, since the two sides had 
established diplomatic relations in October 1990. On this 
occasion, the Vietnamese prime minister had talks with Chairman 
Jacques Delors, and two vice chairmen of the EC. The two sides 
agreed to promote bilateral relations to a new stage. The EC 
chairman was interested in the socioeconomic situation in 
Vietnam and its diplomatic policy which help improve relations 
among nations in the regions and held that Vietnam has followed 
a correct political policy. 
  Chairman Jacques Delors committed to create favorable 
conditions for Vietnam to broaden its relations with the EC 
member countries. For their part, the EC member countries also 
promised to encourage their group to do business with Vietnam. 
The two vice chairmen also held that the visit by Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet was on time and believed that the 
Vietnam-EC relation will be further developed in the future. 
  Before 1990, the EC had provided Vietnam with neccessary aid 
worth of $110 million, (mainly with flour). In 1992, Vietnam 
and the EC signed a contract to manufacture 106 items of textile 
products. The contract had been implemented since early 1993. 
However, due to the lack of technical equipment, Vietnam was 
able to hand over to the EC 54 items of goods. 
  The two-way trade between Vietnam and the EC was estimated 
at 
$530 million, but Vietnam's export was only $224 million. The 
EC also funded Vietnam's program to integrate those who left the 
country illegally. However, the aid provided for Vietnam by EC 
is still limited, and did not respond to the expectations of 
both sides. 
  For this very reason, at 19 November session, the EC 
Parliament adopted a resolution on the EC participation in the 
international program on the repatriation of the Vietnamese 
refugees. The resolution appreciated the results of the program 
which was manifested by the increasing number of voluntary 
repatriates from 1988 to 1992. The resolution called on the EC 
committee to take appropriate measures to complete the program 
on time, and called on its member countries to fulfill their 
commitments. The resolution held that the program result can 
only be sustainable with the help for Vietnam to promote 
socioeconomic situation. Vietnam needs to have (multiple) aid 
granted by EC for developing countries. The resolution called 
on the EC committee to carry out a large scale cooperation 
program with Vietnam. The resolution also advocated further 
talks for the signing of a framework agreement on economic and 
trade agreement with Vietnam in this year, [words indistinct] of 
the representation of Vietnam, following the signing the 
agreement. 
  These activities are in conformity with the statement by EC 
Chairman Jacques Delors at the first meeting with Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet, that let's start a new stage for the future.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 4 -- Mr. Pham Sy Ky, vice minister of 
water resources and permanent vice chairman of the Vietnam 
National Mekong Committee, has granted an interview to VIETNAM 
NEWS AGENCY on the occasion of the first anniversary of the 
signing of the joint communique on the Mekong cooperation and in 
anticipation of a meeting of the group for compiling an 
agreement on Mekong cooperation to be held in Vientiane, Laos. 
  Asked about the activities of the Mekong Working Group which 
was established in accordance with the joint communique, Mr Pham 
Sy Ky said: 
  "The four countries of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam 
signed a joint communique on Mekong cooperation on Feb. 5, 1996 
[date as received] in Hanoi. In this communique, they committed 
to continue cooperation in exploitation of the Mekong River and 
establish a Mekong Working Group with the task of drafting a 
framework agreement for the future Mekong cooperation. [passage 
omitted] 
  On the outstanding problems, Mr Ky said: 
  "The most important one is on the equitable and reasonable 
utilization in detail of water in the main stream of the Mekong 
River during dry season. Though four countries have agreed in 
principle the equitable and reasonable utilization of water, but 
have not yet agreed on detailed stipulations for that issue. 
  "With a view to respecting the legitimate right of the 
countries in the basin, taking into consideration of the needs 
of each country and with cooperative goodwill in utilization of 
water in the Mekong River, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam have 
flexibly applied international laws and good experiences from 
some international river, i.e. the utilization of water in the 
mainstream of Mekong River during dry season shall be subject to 
prior consultation in the committee aiming at arriving an 
agreement before any proposed use by any riparians. However, 
Thailand has not yet agreed to the principle of prior 
consultation for agreement before using water. Hopefully, with 
goodwill for cooperation the deadlock will be overcome at the 
forthcoming meetings and the agreement on Mekong cooperation 
will be concluded." 
  Asked about some Thai newspaper reports saying that Thailand 
is preparing a plan to divert water from the Mekong River to the 
Chao Phraya River basin, Mr. Ky said: "THE NATION newspaper of 
Thailand issued on 3 January 1993 carried out an article citing 
the words of the minister of Prime Minister's Office of Thailand 
on the diversion of Mekong water to the Chao Phraya River basin. 
Nevertheless, the Vietnam National Mekong Committee is not yet 
informed by the Thai side. We think that with goodwill for 
cooperation if Thailand plans to build some structures to take 
water from the Mekong mainstream, especially in the dry season, 
Thailand should inform, consult with other countries in the 
lower Mekong basin in order to assess the impact of its move to 
other countries, and cooperate with the latter to find out 
measures to solve problems if any with a view to arriving at 
unanimity among the riparian countries before construction. The 
consultation should begin at the stage of feasibility study. 
Such consultations are very important for the Mekong 
cooperation, regional cooperation and construction of mutual 
trust." 
  Vietnam, upholding its respect for interests of other 
countries and with its goodwill for cooperation, is ready to 
discuss with other countries in the Mekong basin to find 
satisfactory measures for the reasonable use of the river water 
in order to meet the need of each country. We are sure that the 
international community interested in the Mekong programme will 
support such useful discussions, especially in the increasingly 
improved situation in the region, Mr Ky said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Article by Senior Lieutenant General Dao Dinh Luyen, member </F>
of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and chief of 
the Vietnam People's Army General Staff: "Take a New Step To 
Build a Revolutionary, Regular, Seasoned, and Modern Army Step 
by Step To Meet the Requirements of the Cause of National 
Defense and Construction"] 
  [Text] To date, our Army has gone through nearly half a 
century of building, combat, and development. Throughout the 
course of its heroic birth and growth, our Army has proven 
itself worthy of being called a revolutionary army. It has 
always remained loyal to the party-initiated undertaking and the 
interests of the masses and has won the people's trust, 
assistance, and loving care. Now, as we enter the stage of 
building and defending the socialist fatherland, our Army has to 
undertake a new and very heavy task; namely, building, 
consolidating, and enhancing our combat strength while 
simultaneously participating in production to contribute toward 
firmly maintaining political stability and promoting 
socioeconomic development. 
  With a thorough understanding to the Seventh Party Congress 
Resolution and the party Central Committee Third Plenum 
Resolution on national defense and security in the new 
situation, our entire Army has made serious and very great 
efforts to apply these resolutions to life. As a result, we 
have achieved initial but very important results and made marked 
and steady progress toward building our military organization 
into a revolutionary, regular, seasoned, and modern army step by 
step. 
  Since the conclusion of the Seventh Party Congress, the 
international and regional situations have developed very 
quickly and have become complicated. They have had a very 
great impact on our people's task of building and defending the 
socialist fatherland. These days, our country enjoys peace and 
stability. The renovation undertaking has brought about 
important achievements and opened up great prospects. The 
factors of instability, however, have not yet been eliminated. 
Through the "peaceful evolution" strategy, hostile forces 
abroad are collaborating with reactionary elements at home to 
carry out their dark scheme, aimed at abolishing the Socialist 
Republic of Vietnam. They have directed their offensive 
spearhead against us on all fronts, especially on the 
politico-ideological front, in a bid to sow disunity between the 
Army and people, depoliticize the Army, and neutralize party 
leadership over the Army. That situation requires our entire 
party, people, and Army to heighten their vigilance, strengthen 
national defense capabilities, and consolidate the people's 
armed forces in order to stand ready to cope with every 
eventuality and firmly defend our national independence, 
revolutionary gains, and socialist regime. 
  Over the past three years, thanks to our party's correct 
renovation policy and our people's efforts, we have made 
comprehensive achievements in the national renovation 
undertaking. We have overcome the socioeconomic crisis to a very 
great extent. Our annual economic growth rate has increased 
considerably and steadily. Broad sections of the population 
have had their standard of living improved. Those socioeconomic 
achievements have created the conditions for strengthening our 
national defense capabilities, ensuring political stability, and 
consolidating the people's confidence in party leadership and 
their determination to pursue the socialist path chosen by 
President Ho Chi Minh. 
  Along with the common efforts of our entire party and 
people, 
our Army has made a worthy contribution to building and 
defending the socialist fatherland, especially in the task of 
consolidating our national defense and security capabilities. 
Over the past three years, by fully understanding the party's 
policies and resolutions as well as the new revolutionary tasks, 
our Army has continued to build and consolidate its strength in 
all fields in order to enhance its revolutionary nature and 
combat strength and stand ready to defend the fatherland in the 
new situation. Due attention has been paid to the top priority 
task of providing politico-ideological education to cadres and 
combatants in order to enhance their political background. 
First of all, we have improved both the form and content of the 
educational campaign to promote everyone's awareness of the good 
nature and fine traditions of our Army. As a result, our young 
cadres and combatants these days not only take pride in their 
fathers and elder brothers, but also firmly maintain and develop 
these fine traditions. Due importance has been attached to our 
efforts to enhance the political awareness of cadres, especially 
key cadres. Learning activities have already been organized in 
the framework of the Political General Department's curriculum. 
Constant efforts have been made to keep everyone abreast of the 
revolutionary situation and the Army's tasks, especially to make 
everyone fully aware of the need to heighten vigilance against 
the enemy's dark schemes and maneuvers. Besides 
politico-ideological education, we have taken uniform steps to 
build and revamp the party, consolidate and enhance the quality 
of cadres, and renovate the forms and contents of the political 
indoctrination program in our Army. As a result, we have 
strengthened the leadership role and militancy of grassroots 
party organizations and created conditions for a strict 
application of the principle of absolute party leadership over 
all aspects of Army-related activities. 
  Thanks to the satisfactory measures mentioned above to carry 
out politico-ideological education and strengthen the party's 
leadership over the Army, our cadres and combatants have 
remained steadfast in the face of the enemy's psychological 
warfare maneuvers and the difficulties, challenges, and major 
changes in the international situation. They have constantly 
believed in party leadership, firmly maintained their combat 
determination and goals, and always proven themselves worthy of 
being called a reliable and loyal force of the party and people. 
  As for the goal to revamp the militancy of the armed forces 
in order to meet new requirements arising from the task of 
defending the socialist fatherland, our entire Army has, over 
the past three years, done many things of very fundamental and 
important importance for further development. With the motto of 
building an armed force of appropriate personnel strength and of 
high quality, we have continued to reduce the personnel strength 
of our regular force, consolidate and rearrange various units, 
readjust the personnel strength of our armed services and combat 
branches, and achieve a balance between our main force and our 
local force to suit our strategic disposition on a national 
scale and in each sensitive areas and to meet the demand for 
ensuring sufficient on-site combat force for various defense 
areas and a mobile combat force capable of coping with all the 
situations that may arise in any areas in the country. Troop 
training has been affirmed as a central task. Since 1989, our 
entire army has continued to renovate the contents and 
organizational methods of training with the motto of providing 
basic training in a realistic and steady fashion and with the 
concepts that training must be practical to combat, that lessons 
of experience obtained from the past two wars of resistance must 
be applied in troop training, that training must be conducted in 
such a way as to develop democratic principles and to promote a 
sense of voluntarism and creativity among trainees, and that 
close combination must be achieved between training and 
indoctrination and between theory and practice. Our entire Army 
has applied these mottos and concepts scrupulously and 
creatively. As a result, the quality of troop training has 
further developed in an increasingly steady fashion. In 
particular, over the past three years, we have paid attention to 
training troops in our Army's traditional tactics, such as the 
tactic of using a small force to defeat a larger enemy and the 
tactic of using rudimentary means to triumph over an enemy with 
sophisticated equipment. Therefore, in training, our efforts 
have been directed at attaining the goal of ensuring good combat 
skills for every soldier and every detachment. Soldiers must be 
well-trained in detachment-level combat and in coordinated 
combat involving various armed services and combat branches. In 
order to evaluate its training quality, combat effectiveness, 
and combat readiness, our entire Army has, over the past three 
years, conducted many military drills involving units of various 
sizes, from the detachment to divisional levels. With these 
military drills, the Army has further improved the 
organizational and leadership skills of its cadres and has 
enabled cadres to familiarize themselves with "combat." Also 
through training, we have drawn on many good lessons of 
experiences, including experience on our residual shortcomings, 
in order to ensure better training for troops. The results 
obtained in troop training and indoctrination have helped 
concolidate the determination and confidence of cadres and 
combatants in their bid to fulfill their task of defending 
national independence and sovereignty and the territorial 
integrity of the fatherland. 
  Along with renovating our training, we have also vigorously 
deployed our research on science, technology, and military arts. 
We have initially resolved a number of problems arising in 
combat and decided on the course for ensuring adequate equipment 
for troops. 
  In combat, we have concentrated on summing up lessons of 
experience obtained in the two past wars of resistance. On this 
basis, we have been able to deploy and develop our activities 
to suit the existing principles of our people's warfare and our 
national defense. We have made appropriate investment in the 
research and perfection of the methods of fighting in defense 
areas for all the three categories of troops. We have also 
stressed studying and getting to know the enemy. Therefore, 
information on the enemy, including his equipment and weapons, 
military doctrine, and combat tactics, has been promptly 
exploited to serve our research activities. This has created a 
basis for us to map out our counterpolicies and countermeasures. 
  Ensuring equipment for troops to meet existing and long-term 
requirements is a new and difficult issue for our Army. 
Proceeding from studying our realitic capabilities to learning 
the experience obtained by countries with situations similar to 
ours, we have basically been able to come up with appropriate 
policies and lines. As an immediate task, we must concentrate 
our efforts on preserving and maintaining satisfactorily our 
existing equipment. As for obsolete and degraded equipment, we 
must study ways to exploit to the fullest whatever is left. 
Meanwhile, we must study the possibility of modernizing various 
kinds of weapons and equipment to suit our combat tactics. In 
the long run, we have been and are building a national defense 
industry to manufacture the most essential equipment and weapons 
for our troops. All these policies have been implemented by our 
entire Army with great efforts and encouraging results have been 
achieved. The scientific and technical cadres in the Army have 
made worthy contributions and successfully carried out many 
valuable scientific and technical projects. 
  Although building a regular army is a goal that has been 
followed for many years now, the Standing Committee of the 
Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee Military Commission 
recently issued a directive urging our entire Army to further 
step up this move aimed at effecting an important change for the 
better in the direction of military standardization. All 
elements of the Army, ranging from agencies to units, have 
concentrated on providing leadership and guidance to troops and 
come up with substantive measures. Therefore, positive changes 
for the better have been initially noted in both the thoughts 
and actions of our cadres and combatants. Efforts to ensure 
logistics for support of standardization have been intensified 
and as has the budget earmarked for this. Therefore, all the 
systems governing room and board and dress code for troops have 
been improved. In particular, efforts to ensure unified 
specifications for military uniforms such as color, design, and 
quality have shown remarkable improvements. Troop management has 
also been given constant attention by various echelons. 
Therefore, changes for the better have been noted in the 
maintenance of various systems of daily routine, official work, 
and observance of military ceremonies and bearing. The number of 
troops violating military discipline or deserting their units 
has dropped sharply. 
  The Army's achievements scored in the past three years 
after the meeting of the seventh national party congress in 
military building, training, and combat readiness have proved 
the great efforts exerted by our cadres and soldiers. These 
achievements are very fundamental and they are creating a firm 
foundation for subsequent development steps, despite some 
remaining problems and shortcomings in our new requirements and 
duties. 
  In few week's time, our Army will observe its 50th 
anniversary, the age of many past challenges and experiences. 
We are confidently building an Army that deserves the party and 
people's expectation from an Uncle Ho Army of the people, by the 
people, and for the people. 
  To meet that expectation, in the coming years, we have to 
make more fundamental improvements to fulfill our both current 
and future requirements and duties and to change our 
revolutionary army to a regular, efficient, and modern army for 
the protection of national independence, sovereignty, and 
integrity and for our goal of making people prosperous, nation 
powerful, and society civilized. The most important thing is 
the education on politics, ideology, national tradition and 
patriotism, and army tradition to make our cadres and soldiers 
resolute in their ideology and fighting spirit and vigilant at 
enemy conspiracies and tricks when they try to neutralize the 
politicalization of our Army before invalidating our armed 
forces. The party leadership over the Army must be further 
strengthened to ensure that, in any situation, the armed forces 
are absolutely reliable and loyal to the party and national 
interests. The Army must increase its socioeconomic activities 
and mass mobilization work to improve its public relations, 
unite with the people, and preserve its nature as an army of the 
people and one who fights for the people. 
  The improvement of our Army's capacity for fighting is an 
urgent issue. Therefore, it is necessary to concentrate all our 
efforts to accomplish these tasks: 
  1. Further accelerating the military standardization: 
  We must thoroughly understand the contents and requirements 
of military standardization. Standardization is not only a 
formality but also a necessary demand for a revolutionary army 
to create high unity in conception and action, from military 
organs to units and from cadres to soldiers for the creation of 
a combined strength. 
  Military standardization is a long-term undertaking. But in 
1994, we must strive to standardize the practice in military 
training, combat readiness, and personnel and equipment 
management. Especially, we must establish working regulations 
for each military position. We must introduce uniforms for the 
entire Army, creating a new image worthy of the honor and pride 
of an heroic army. Together with fine uniforms, we have to train 
the troops in military protocol, proper behavior for soldiers, 
and working relations according to Army regulations. 
  2. Further improve military training: 
  All units must understand that military training is a 
regular 
and permanent task in peace time. In the past three years, due 
to the reform of the training programs, methods, and 
organization, we have achieved relatively complete results with 
useful experiences. On that basis, we need to bring the 
technological and tactical skills to a higher level. 
  We must continue to provide soldiers with fundamental, 
practical, and sound training suitable to the particular duties 
of each unit. For the main force, we must train soldiers to 
fight with assigned weapons by themselves and together with 
other Army branches and forces. For the local and militia 
forces, we must train them to fight in small units and attack 
the enemy's area, logistic establishments, and storage 
facilities, how to maintain social order and security, and how 
to protect the government and people at the grassroots level. 
  In the training process, the creativity of each cadre and 
soldier must be developed to make them become more flexible and 
active in combat. The training must concentrate on current 
requirements in order to enhance their capacity to deal with all 
forms of military intervention by enemy forces when they try to 
provide support to peaceful evolution and violently overthrow 
activities of reactionary domestic groups. 
  3. Continuing to build completely strong units according to 
five requirements set forth by the National Defense Ministry. 
  Through review, experiences drawn from exemplary units 
should 
be widely applied in the remaining units. We have to do our 
best to eliminate weak units and stop desertion. Experience 
proves that if there is a close coordination between recruitment 
units and local authorities in troop management and education 
and in dealing with deserted soldiers, the desertion problem 
will be overcome. Better care for spiritual and material life 
is also very important to help the soldiers feel more attached 
to their units and to carry out their duties. The building of 
completely strong units must be linked with efforts to improve 
party building work and other movements to create great change 
in each military unit and the entire armed force. 
  Consequently, the three duties of military standardization, 
training, and building are closely linked in a chain reaction. 
Therefore, in the implementation process, all units need to 
carry out uniform planning for these three duties. They must 
not look down on any duty, but consider the military 
standardization a regular and permanent task. 
  Soon, the Army will celebrate its 50th anniversary. The 
entire force should launch emulative movements to improve the 
sense of responsibility in all cadres and soldiers. They should 
urge each other to do their best in their military achievements 
to take the Army to new heights to meet the expectations of the 
party and people in protecting independence, sovereignty, and 
national integrity and maintaining peace and stability for 
national construction and development. Their goals continue to 
be to make people prosperous, the nation powerful, and society 
civilized.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 3 -- The renovation of banking in Ho 
Chi Minh City in the last three years has gained good results, 
says bank officials at a conference held in the city last 
Wednesday. The two main banking systems -- the State Bank with 
its management responsibilities and the commercial banks and 
credit organisations which undertake money transactions, credits 
and banking services -- have improved significantly. The whole 
network has thus become the most versatile and developed in the 
whole country. 
  In 1993 new systems were established -- state-run commercial 
banks, joint-stock commercial banks, financial companies, 
jewellery companies, foreign-owned and joint venture banks. 
  Total capital mobilized in the year was estimated at VND 
[Vietnamese dong] 6,045 billion (USD [U.S. dollars] 60.45 
million), a twofold increase from 1991. Also, a foreign exchange 
centre has been founded to solve the problem of supply and 
demand in foreign currencies, especially for import and export. 
Speaking at the conference, State Bank Governor-General Cao Si 
Kiem approved proposals for the improvement of the jewel 
business and the strengthening of state management of foreign 
banks. He also agreed on the need of improving the efficiency 
of joint-stock commercial banks, giving priority to medium and 
long-term credit sources, and helping train bank staff to 
international levels.

  [Text] Vietsovpetro pumped up 6.3 million tonnes of crude 
oil in 1993, bringing to over 21 million tonnes the volume 
obtained from Bach Ho oil field so far. This represented an 
increase of 0.8 million tonnes over the previous year. However, 
the amount was just [word indistinct] the 6.5 million tonnes 
projected for the whole year. Last year, 10 more wells were 
brought into operation, which -- together with the effort of the 
company in applying new technology -- helped raise daily output 
from 16,000 to 20,000 tonnes. 
  Vietsovpetro sets the target of 6.8 million tonnes for 1994, 
and plans to produce 60 million tonnes from now to the year 2000.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 5 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata will urge Chinese leaders during his upcoming visit to 
Beijing to agree to a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing, 
Foreign Ministry sources said Wednesday [5 January]. The 
sources said Hata will make the call in his talks on Saturday 
with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. They said Japan 
wants China to "positively engage" in negotiations expected to 
get under way this year in Geneva on a comprehensive global ban 
on nuclear testing. 
  Despite Qian's call at the UN General Assembly in September 
for early test ban talks, China on October 5 conducted an 
underground nuclear test that threatened to unravel a fragile 
moratorium on testing by other nuclear powers. 
  Critics said China's move also undermined efforts for a 
renewal this year of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, as 
nuclear powers could be seen as practicing a double standard by 
calling for nonproliferation while continuing nuclear tests. 
China subsequently pledged, however, to work with other 
countries to achieve a test ban treaty "no later than 1996." 
  Hata would also convey Japan's support for China's early 
entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 
the sources said.

  [Text] ARANYAPRATHET, Thailand, Jan 5 (AFP) -- Cambodian 
royalist and Khmer Rouge representatives plan to meet in the 
Thai town of Surin on Saturday [8 January] to discuss peace 
moves, a ranking Thai military official said here Wednesday. 
  He said that Lieutenant General Chea Savan, secretary to 
co-chief of staff Ke Kimyan, would represent the royalist 
FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, 
Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and General Ta Mok would 
represent the Khmer Rouge. No independent confirmation was 
immediately available. 
  The official said the planned meeting would follow secret 
talks in Bangkok between the two sides, who were once allies in 
a coalition against the Phnom Penh government set up by Vietnam. 
  There was no indication of participation by a member of the 
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) which shares power in Phnom Penh 
with FUNCINPEC following May elections. The Khmer Rouge, which 
boycotted the elections, was understood to have offered a 
ceasefire in exchange for posts in the Phnom Penh government. 
  Meanwhile, both the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge 
continued to bring up reinforcements into western Cambodia where 
three days of fighting at the New Year left almost 50 dead, the 
Thai military said. 
  A trader arriving in the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet 
Wednesday said he had seen long lines of military trucks 
carrying arms on the 150-kilometer (90-mile) highway from 
Battambang toward Poipet, especially around Sisophon. Both 
sides were taking advantage of a two-day ceasefire Wednesday and 
Thursday arranged by Thailand so that Thai troops could help 
farmers to bring the rice crop in from the fields, military 
officials said. 
  Late Wednesday afternoon, border patrol police reported one 
shell landed on the Thai side of the border but said there was 
no damage. There was no indication of significant clashes on the 
Cambodian side. 
  In Poipet, Cambodian government Brigadier General Em Saray 
said he had been ordered to launch an offensive against the 
Khmer Rouge in late December. He said he was awaiting fresh 
orders related to political developments as well as supplies of 
ammunition.

Cambodian Government soldiers, as well as many casualties. The 
site is about 13 km from the Thai border. The Khmer Rouge 
division seized Hill 25 on 2 January. 
  The Khmer Rouge shelling took place as Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai was visiting fire victims in Aranyaprathet District. 
  Cambodian Government forces are reportedly preparing to 
launch a campaign to retake Hill 25, which is near Thailand's 
Laem Nong Ian, Tambon Tha Kham, Arayaprathet District.

<F P=106> ["Foolish Jargon of the Doomed" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on the trash spun out by Kim Yong-sam the traitor on 
the New Year. Drivelling about "larger reforms", he blared that 
he would make the New Year a "year of liquidating the corruption 
and building a clean society" and charged the North with 
"suspected nuclear development". 
  Dismissing his remarks as a foolish outcry of a doomed 
mortal 
forsaken by the times and the people, the news analyst says: 
  The "reforms" launched by the puppets are intended to build 
up their "pro-government system" and consolidate the foundation 
of their rule. What the "reforms" brought to the South Korean 
people is, in fact, bloody sword brandishing and chronicle 
poverty. 
  Now the South Korean people are waging an anti-"government" 
struggle, saying that there is no need to watch the Kim Yong-sam 
"regime" under the "civilian" veil any longer and they have 
nothing to expect from it and that there is no alternative but 
to overthrow it. 
  Such being the situation, who would believe the 
advertisement 
about "larger reforms". 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam's provocation against the North 
over 
its "suspected nuclear development" is an act of one who has 
lost a normal mode of thinking. It is needless to say that the 
traitor is behaving recklessly, bereft of reason, urged by the 
sinister intention to put a brake on the DPRK-U.S. talks at any 
cost and stifle fellow countrymen through an "international 
cooperation system", vexed at the progress of the talks. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam had better act with discretion, 
mindful that his treacherous utterances at the beginning of the 
year will only lead him more quickly to his grave.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Traitor's New Year </F>
Gibberish"] 
  [Text] The crow, cawing twelve times, can only utter caw, 
so the saying goes. This means that one who is a bad man by 
nature can only say bad things. This was the case with the 
puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam when he made a so-called New Year's 
address. In making silly gibberish, he raved that the new year 
should be made a year for eliminating still-remaining 
irregularities and corruption and making a new, clean society. 
In other words, he intends to continue with the reform game. 
This is really dumbfounding. 
  Since traitor Kim Yong-sam came to power wearing a mask of a 
civilian regime, the wind of reform has blown frantically in 
South Korea for nearly a year. However, the result has been 
horrible. To conduct a real reform in the colonial fascist 
South Korean society, they should realize that the people aspire 
for independence and democratization in the first place. To 
eliminate corruption and irregularities, they should take 
practical measures to preclude illegal amassment of wealth in 
the first place. They should distinguish themselves clearly 
from their preceding military fascist regimes, and rectify the 
wrongs of the past. 
  However, the puppet clique, instead of implementing a reform 
aimed at freeing itself from the domination of a foreign force, 
left South Korea totally under the domination of a foreign 
force. Furthermore, the puppet clique raved that the foreign 
force should dominate the Korean peninsula after the 
reunification, as well. Since it came to power, the puppet 
clique has kept intact the fascist evil laws, such as the 
National Security Law, and the suppressive organizations, such 
as the Agency for National Security Planning, the police, and 
the prosecutor's office. Further strengthening their function 
and authority, the puppet clique is stepping up the degree of 
suppression on the people. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique, which had raved about departing 
from 
his preceding dictatorial regimes, pardoned the murderers of 
Kwangju, babbling that it could not jeopardize the future simply 
because it had a bad sentiment of the past event. While raving 
that it would root out irregularities, it purged its rival 
forces and was bent on strengthening its basis for power. 
  The aftermath of the implementation of the real-name 
financial transaction system, which the Kim Yong-sam clique 
claimed to be the reform of reforms, brought about further 
bankruptcy and a decline in the economy. Agriculture ended up 
with a bad crop, the worst in 80 years, shrinking the rice 
harvest by over 10 million sacks compared with the volume 
originally anticipated. 
  The stern reality of South Korea for nearly a one-year 
period, last year, clearly showed that the reform, which the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique publicized so loudly, was not reform for 
the better but reform for the worse. The falsity of the 
so-called reform has been exposed thoroughly. There is nothing 
the workers, the peasants, and the popular masses gained from 
it. Nevertheless, traitor Kim Yong-sam made a gibberish about 
reform again. This is a deception and mockery of the South 
Korean people once again. 
  More intolerable is the fact that he, in a so-called New 
Year's address, criticized us, saying that the suspicion of the 
North's nuclear weapons development should be resolved. 
  As has been reported, in the recent contact, the DPRK and 
the 
United States removed a series of (?obstacles), which had 
brought the DPRK-U.S. talks into a stalemate, displaying the 
spirit of understanding and cooperation toward each other, thus 
bringing forth a breakthrough for the progress of the talks. At 
a time like this, traitor Kim Yong-sam made a presumptuous 
blunder of criticizing us. This reveals his vicious scheme to 
step up the slanderous maneuvers to harm the fellow countrymen 
in the new year under the pretext of the suspicion of our 
fictitious nuclear program. 
  He raved about the suspicion of our nuclear program as soon 
as the new year began, out of fear that the U.S. promise to 
maintain the international cooperation system it gave him during 
his junket to the United States last November in return for the 
total opening of the South Korean rice market may come to 
naught. It is presumptuous and indiscreet of him, the puppet 
clique without any real power or voice, to babble about the 
issue that is to be resolved between the DPRK and the United 
States. 
  Delivering a so-called New Year's address, he was not able 
to 
say anything new but repeated the old tune. This is far from 
surprising. Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a completely ignorant man 
without any independent opinion or political philosophy, a 
politico in whose belly there is only the greed for power, and a 
dirty man. 
  The South Korean people are well aware that no matter what 
traitor Kim Yong-sam raves about doing something in the new 
year, they have nothing to expect from it. They, therefore, are 
determined to fight against the clique to the end. The Kim 
Yong-sam clique, the flunkeyist traitor who turned against the 
country and the nation, will not be able to escape from the 
stern judgment of history and the people.

  [Text] The South Korean puppet clique is frantically trying 
to stir up a war mood [chonjaengyorul kochwihanunde hyorani 
toego issumnida] that extremely strains the situation of the 
Korean peninsula in the beginning of the year. According to 
reports, during the so-called ceremony for the commencement of 
the work for this year held on 3 January, the South Korean 
puppet Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said the Army, Navy, and 
Air Force should also maintain a strong combat posture in the 
new year. 
  On the same day, Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the joint Chiefs of 
Staff, also made bellicose remarks that the military posture 
should be rounded off to cope with the North's threat of war, 
that a posture of prompt counteraction should be established, 
and the like. 
  The belligerent remarks of the puppet military leaders 
[koeroe kunbu udumoridul] in the beginning of the year plainly 
revealed their scheme of armed confrontation with us [urirul 
pandaehanun muryok taegyol kido], and they are an intolerable 
grave challenge to the fellow countrymen who aspire to peace and 
reunification of the country. This shows that though they are 
apparently talking about dialogue and the exchange of envoys, 
the South Korean puppets actually hindered them and are only 
pursuing North-South confrontation. 
  If the South Korean puppets dare to provoke us, we will 
definitely [kyoltanko] control the fire with fire and give a 
strict punishment [tanhohan chingbol] to the provokers.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- Radio Voice of 
National Salvation in Seoul aired a communique on an enlarged 
meeting of the standing committee of the Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon). 
  "On immediate tasks of the democratic camp of the nation to 
develop movement for independence, democracy and reunification" 
and "on significantly celebrating the 25th founding anniversary 
of Hanminjon" were discussed at the meeting which was held in 
Seoul on January 2, according to the communique. 
  The meeting, basing itself on an analysis, noted that the 
New 
Year's political situation is mainly characterized by the crisis 
of the colonial rule of the U.S. imperialists which is growing 
all the more serious with the "civilian" veil of treacherous Kim 
Yong-sam "regime" completely taken off and urged the democratic 
patriotic forces to fight more courageously, full of confidence 
and optimism. 
  It was noted at the meeting that 1994 is a momentous year in 
which a new horizon should be opened for independence, democracy 
and reunification by installing a springboard for a decisive 
victory in confrontation with the colonial fascist forces. 
  It was unanimously stressed that the democratic patriotic 
forces should turn out in a valiant struggle to overthrow the 
Kim Yong-sam "government". 
  The meeting fully supported the New Year address of the 
great 
leader President Kim Il-song which brightly illumines the road 
of national reunification in the New Year. 
  The meeting expressed the will to model the ranks of 
Hanminjon on the chuche idea and awaken and organize the masses 
at an accelerated pace and achieve a new turnround in the 
national democratic movement in this meaningful year in which 
falls the 25th founding anniversary of Hanminjon. 
  The meeting deliberated on and adopted "declaration on the 
situation" and "immediate fighting slogans", documents of the 
Central Committee of Hanminjon, and adopted a resolution on 
significantly greeting the 25th birthday of Hanminjon. 
  The "immediate fighting slogans" reflecting the demands of 
the situation and will of the masses include calls for 
overthrowing the treacherous fascist "government" of Kim 
Yong-sam, achieving national independence and developing the 
mass movement for independence, democracy and reunification.

<F P=106> ["Hanminjon Declares Its Break With Kim Yong-sam </F>
Regime"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) solemnly vowed to 
overthrow the Kim Yong-sam regime, joining all people who aspire 
after independence, democracy and reunification in declaring a 
resolute break with it. 
  This stand was manifested in the "declaration on the 
situation" adopted at an enlarged meeting of the standing 
committee of the Central Committee of Hanminjon, according to 
Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation. 
  The "declaration on the situation" says: 
  "The Kim Yong-sam regime born of the womb of the `sixth 
republic' under the `civilian' veil loudly advertised `changes' 
and `reform' for 10 months after its appearance. But nothing 
but the sediment of the military dictatorship remains and there 
is nothing done for the people. 
  "There is no ruler of South Korea who did not serve the 
United States as its stooge. But there was no such stooge as 
Kim Yong-sam who got the promise of the U.S. to leave its forces 
in South Korea in reward for his role of a `shockbrigade' in 
executing its `plan of a new Pacific community' and offered 
human and material resources wholly to it as strategic supplies. 
  "Today the traitor Kim Yong-sam relinquished the demand for 
the liquidation of the Japanese imperialists' colonial past and 
compensation to `comfort women for the army' and has flung the 
door wide open for the reinvasion of the Japanese reactionaries 
who are trying to become a military power and a nuclear power. 
  "Owing to these treacherous acts of the Kim Yong-sam group, 
the dialogue and exchange which took place even under the 
military dictatorship of the `sixth republic' has been 
completely stopped, the North-South agreements remain mere 
sheets of paper, the North-South relations have been totally 
frozen and dark clouds of a nuclear war hanging over the heads 
of the nation. It is the general view of our people that the 
treacherous Kim Yong-sam regime must no longer be left alone." 
  The declaration calls for overthrowing the sham civilian 
"government", establishing a genuine independent and democratic 
government and putting the movement for independence, democracy 
and reunification on its track. 
  The declaration also calls for achieving the unity of the 
patriotic, democratic forces to fight till they have 
fundamentally removed colonial domination, fascist dictatorship 
and national division and won independence, democracy and 
reunification.

  [Text] According to reports, Japanese Foreign Minister Hata 
told a preposterous sophistry during a news conference by saying 
that the suspicion of North Korea's nuclear development is a 
factor of restlessness in the entire Asian region. 
  In view of Hata's slanderous remarks against us in his first 
official appearance in the new year, it is not hard to predict 
that the Japanese authorities' hostile, anti-Republic maneuver 
[pangonghwaguk choktaesi chaektong], far from being alleviated, 
will become more unscrupulous this year. 
  Hata's remarks, that greatly agitate us, are utterly 
destructive [paekhae muik]. They are of no help in resolving 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, but will only result 
in complicating the situation. 
  The Japanese authorities' continued provocative utterances 
of 
slandering and defaming us plainly show that they still seek a 
sinister scheme [hyungcheak] to isolate and ruin [malsal] us in 
conspiracy with seditious forces, far from atoning for 
immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings they criminally imposed 
on our people in the past and establishing good-neighborly 
relations with us. 
  The first issue in the new year of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
reported that it is highly possible that Japan will participate 
in war on the Korean peninsula in case of an emergency. This 
clearly shows the Japanese authorities' ambition for reinvasion 
[chaechim kido]. 
  The Japanese authorities' attempt to gain supremacy over 
[cheap] our Republic with force is a futile illusion. 
  The Japanese authorities must look straight at the trend of 
the times and should not act rashly and thoughtlessly.

National Reunification" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- The principled stand 
regarding national reunification clarified by the respected 
leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year address serves as a 
banner inspiring the whole nation to accomplish the cause of 
reunification in the 90s, tiding over difficulties in the way of 
the nation, said Kim Pyong-sik, vice-president of the DPRK and 
chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Social 
Democratic Party, in his statement to the press on January 4. 
  He said that the great leader in his New Year address 
pointed 
out that in future, too, the government of the DPRK would make 
every effort to reunify the country in the form of confederation 
which is based on one nation, one state, two systems and two 
governments, in accordance with the three principles of 
independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity. 
  He said that all the compatriots in the North, South and 
abroad should turn out as one man to establish a unified 
confederal state, closely united in one mind, transcending the 
differences in ideology, ideal and political view and religious 
belief under the banner of the 10-point program of the great 
unity of the whole nation. 
  Noting that the respected leader President Kim Il-song in 
the 
New Year address expounded the principled stand of the 
government of the DPRK that the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula should be settled through the DPRK-U.S. talks, he said 
that the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula should be 
solved through negotiation between the United States which 
introduced nuclear weapons and the DPRK exposed to its potential 
threat and the United States must know that it will get nothing 
from resorting to pressure and threat. 
  The entire members of the Korean Social Democratic Party in 
hearty response to the New Year address of the great leader 
President Kim Il-song would make all efforts to achieve 
reunification in the 90s by great national unity, he declared.

  [Text] On 5 December, a relevant government official 
revealed that North Korea and the United States have completely 
reached an agreement on the principles for inspection of seven 
nuclear-related facilities in North Korea by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], on announcing the suspension of the 
Team Spirit exercise, and on resumption of North-South dialogue 
in a third round of high-level talks. The official added that 
removing differences over minor issues was the only procedure 
remaining. 
  The official said that the two sides differed on the title 
for inspection of the North, but that the two sides agreed late 
last year that "inspections will be carried out so that the 
IAEA's safeguards measure in North Korea and its continuity are 
ensured." Thus, he indicated that the only remaining point of 
dispute was the venue for discussions between the IAEA and North 
Korea on resumption of inspections. 
  Observers believe that North Korea may agree on sites other 
than Pyongyang as the venue for discussion of resumption of 
inspections. 
  Another government official said that "suspension of the 
Team 
Spirit exercise will also be announced when North Korea 
officially expresses its will to accept inspection." He added 
however, that the announcement of the suspension of the Team 
Spirit exercise will be made with the proviso that IAEA 
inspections should be carried out successfully and that the 
exchange of special envoys of the North and the South should be 
realized.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam by </F>
unidentified correspondent; from the 1 January NHAN DAN -- 
place, date not given] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Dear Comrade Foreign Minister: Last 
year we made remarkable achievements in our diplomatic 
activities. Could you please elaborate on some of them? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] Last year, we made great achievements in 
our nation's diplomatic activities. We have entered a new stage 
of development in our relations with neighboring Southeast Asian 
nations, thus opening up a new era of cooperation with these 
countries on a larger scale, especially in the trade and 
economic domains. The most important event was party General 
Secretary Do Muoi's official visit to Singapore and Thailand. 
On this occasion, Vietnam declared a four-point policy toward 
the region, asserting Vietnam's firm policy of strengthening its 
multifaceted relations with each and every ASEAN member. 
Vietnam also stressed its willingness to join ASEAN at an 
appropriate date. ASEAN members have become our trading 
partners. As of mid-1993, investment in Vietnam by ASEAN 
members had reached $483.4 million, while their trade with 
Vietnam was valued at $1.8 billion in 1992. 
  As for the People's Republic of China, Vietnam highly 
treasures its relations with this country. It has consistently 
consolidated its friendship and strengthened bilateral 
cooperation with China to resolve all outstanding problems step 
by step through peaceful negotiations. In this context, in 
October 1993 both sides signed an agreement on fundamental 
principles for resolving the issue of land and sea borders 
between the two countries, especially the land border and areas 
in the Gulf of Tonkin. Both sides agreed to continue talks on 
issues related to the sea in order to reach a fundamental and 
long-lasting solution. This is in the interests of the two 
peoples and of regional peace, stability, and cooperation. 
President Le Duc Anh's friendly official visit to China last 
November was a new step in accelerating and developing relations 
between the two countries. 
  With Prime Minister's Vo Van Kiet official visit to Japan, 
the Republic of Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, we completed 
the process of establishing and normalizing relations with all 
the countries from Northeast Asia to the South Pacific region. 
This creates favorable conditions for Vietnam to solicit 
capital and technology from these countries and promote trade 
and economic relations. Japan has become Vietnam's top trading 
partner. The country increased its development aid to Vietnam 
from $360 million during the 1992-93 fiscal year to more than 
$550 million in 1993-94. 
  Relations between Vietnam and the EC, the world's foremost 
politico-economic center, have developed remarkably. The 
European countries have highly appraised Vietnam's achievements 
in renovation and foreign policy. They attach importance to 
Vietnam's position in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific 
region. As a result, they have reached agreements with Vietnam 
to carry out long-term cooperation projects and have pledged to 
continue increasing development aid to Vietnam. Having signed 
an agreement on textile production with Vietnam in late 1992, 
the EC is making preparations to sign an agreement with our 
country on economic, trade, and scientific-technological 
cooperation. 
  Vietnam and Laos exchanged visits by high-level party and 
state delegations to consolidate and strengthen the traditional 
friendship and special solidarity between the two peoples as 
well as to accelerate bilateral cooperation in line with the new 
situation. 
  Vietnam's neighborly and friendly relations with Cambodia 
have been strengthened to a new level. Both sides have agreed 
to settle bilateral issues step by step through peaceful 
negotiations and on the basis of respecting each other's 
independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and legitimate 
interests in line with international law and practices and in 
accordance with each country's law and customs. 
  The Cuban people face acute difficulties. Vietnam provided 
material aid to our Cuban friends and positively supported the 
Cuban people's struggle against the U.S. embargo. Our party and 
government delegation's official visit to Cuba in July 1993 was 
a vivid manifestation of the traditional relations and 
solidarity between the two peoples. 
  A prominent result of last year's activities was the 
normalization of our relations with international financial and 
monetary organizations. On that basis, the IMF, the World Bank, 
and the Asian Development Bank agreed to lend us more than $700 
million in 1993, and promised bigger loans in the coming years 
to improve, upgrade, and construct Vietnam's infrastructure. 
The first international conference to provide financial 
assistance to Vietnam convened in Paris in November 1993, with 
the participation of 22 countries and 17 international 
organizations. They agreed to provide us $1.86 billion in grant 
aid and concessional loans during the 1993-1994 financial year. 
Recently, sympathetic to our difficulties, the members of the 
Paris credit club decided to reduce 50 percent of our debt, 
extend our loan repayment period, and reduce the interest rates 
on the remaining loans. These things testify to a clear change 
in the world community's attitude toward Vietnam, a country that 
is enjoying success in its renovation policy and foreign policy 
of openness and is moving ahead with promising steps. 
  [Correspondent] Vietnamese-U.S. relations have not been 
completely normalized. There have been some significant 
changes, however. Could you evaluate the progress and its 
effects? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] America is the only big and developed 
country that has not normalized relations with Vietnam. It 
still maintains a trade embargo against Vietnam. The 
development of Vietnam's relations with regional nations, 
developed countries, and major politico-economic centers, 
however, clearly shows that the U.S. trade embargo runs counter 
to the common trend. 
  Nevertheless, there was certain progress in the 
normalization 
process last year. Many meetings were held at different levels 
to exchange views on issues of mutual concern and accelerate 
normalization, especially the meetings between Deputy Prime 
Minister Pham Van Khai and American politicians, including 
high-level American officials in Washington; and the meeting 
between our foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state in 
Singapore. 
  The normalization of Vietnam's relations with international 
financial and monetary organizations was effected by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's 2 July statement ending opposition to 
other countries providing loans to Vietnam for the repayment of 
its debt to IMF, and the 13 September statement and 23 December 
decision by the U.S. Treasury allowing American companies to 
participate in projects carried out in Vietnam by international 
financial and monetary organizations. These moves also helped 
encourage other countries to develop relations with Vietnam. 
  [Correspondent] Do you have any comments and predictions 
regarding our foreign affairs activities in 1994? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] In 1993, our active, vivid, and 
diversified 
foreign affairs activities were carried out with a positive and 
active spirit and with the participation of all echelons and 
levels of the party, government, National Assembly, and mass 
organizations. These activities achieved important results and 
improved Vietnam's reputation and position in the international 
community. This creates an environment of peace and stability 
and favorable international conditions for Vietnam to attract 
more foreign capital and technology for our economic development 
and national construction and protection. This is also the 
foundation for the implementation of our foreign affairs duties, 
including foreign economic affairs, in 1994 and subsequent years. 
  Our important victory in foreign affairs confirms the 
correctness of the line set forth by the Seventh National Party 
Congress, concretized by the Third Plenum Resolution of the 
Seventh Party Central Committee in June 1992. From this line 
and from the vivid activities in past years, especially 1993, a 
prominent feature of Vietnam's new diplomatic policy has been 
formed. This is the policy of treasuring harmonious and 
friendly relations for mutual benefit with neighboring and 
regional countries. This is also the policy of diversifying 
multilateral relations with all nations in the world community. 
This harmonious combination is a special feature of Vietnamese 
diplomacy in the renovation era that meets the rapid and 
complicated changes in the world situation and regional 
political and economic forces. This diplomatic policy is also 
suitable to the common trend in the world following the Cold War 
era. 
  In the new international environment, our open-door foreign 
policy is integrating our country with the world community on 
the basis of our chosen path and on the principles of 
independence, sovereignty, international unity, and preservation 
of national characteristics and interests.

  [Text] Wearing the horsehair cap of a civilian-led 
government, the present regime in South Korea runs counter to 
the unanimous desire of the 70 million fellow countrymen by 
advancing on the road of dependence on outside forces and 
North-South confrontation, thereby further revealing treacherous 
colors with each passing day. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is 
further clinging to outside forces while looking for a way to 
perpetuate the present national division. 
  This is exemplified by traitor Kim Yong-sam's promise to 
provide $3 billion every year for the upkeep of the U.S. 
imperialist aggression forces occupying South Korea in the two 
rounds of summit talks with the United States and the annual 
South Korean-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting held in July and 
November last year in which he begged for the U.S. imperialist 
aggression forces' permanent occupation of South Korea. 
  In a bid to nail the U.S. imperialist aggression forces down 
in South Korea at all costs, the Kim Yong-sam clique not only 
allowed the United States in last April and May to utilize ports 
in South Korea freely in an emergency according to the 
aggressive and treacherous Wartime Host Nations Support 
Agreement, but also took the treacherous step of allowing the 
U.S. 7th Air Force continuous use of the U.S. Air Force's 
installations and facilities which had been returned to South 
Korea. 
  Particularly, we cannot overlook the fact that the Kim 
Yong-sam clique has given the South Korean rice market to its 
U.S. masters in order to seek an international cooperative 
system to crush [apsal] their own fellow countrymen despite the 
South Korean people's unanimous objection. This is a 
treacherous act that can be committed only by traitors who have 
inherited the dirty blood of the five enemies of the Ulsa Treaty. 
  Caught up in its maneuvers to perpetuate division, the 
puppet 
clique is clinging to the forces of Japanese military aggressors 
without hesitation in order to find a way to survive. During 
secret talks with the Japanese prime minister who visited South 
Korea in early November last year, the Kim Yong-sam clique 
promised that he would forget past nefarious atrocities 
committed by Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in 
return for Japan's cooperation in the settlement of the nuclear 
issue. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet government is much more vicious than 
previous puppet governments in aggravating North-South 
confrontation. The warmaniacs of civilian government incite the 
spirit of war and northward invasion by making indiscriminate 
and violent war remarks like the so-called military 
countermeasure or full readiness, under the pretext of 
non-existent nuclear development in the North. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group have appropriated a great amount of 
money from the budget, over ten trillions, for military 
expenditures this year, as never before attempted by any 
previous dictators, thus revealing their true nature as 
warmaniacs.

<F P=106> ["Traitorous `Civilian'-Veiled Group Shunning Fellow </F>
Countrymen and Depending on Outside Forces"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comes out with an article denouncing the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique for sticking to the policy of thinking more of outside 
forces than of fellow countrymen and depending on those forces, 
while ignoring the priniciple of national independence, the 
basic principle in the settlement of the reunification question. 
  The author of the article says: 
  Kim Yong-sam, taking office, said that no outside forces 
could "be better than the nation." This was, however, an empty 
talk to cheat and flout the people. 
  This is proved, first of all, by the fact that his clique 
intends to leave South Korea under foreign domination and yoke 
indefinitely, begging of outside forces "protection" and 
"security assistance." 
  Whenever the traitor Kim Yong-sam met with his U.S. master, 
he implored for a permanent U.S. military occupation of South 
Korea, saying that U.S. troops must not be withdrawn from there. 
He even committed himself to a greater burden share for the 
maintenance of the aggressor forces in return for the shelving 
of the "U.S. troop cutback plan." 
  His clique describes the U.S. troops present in South Korea 
as "a war deterrent" and extols them as "apostles of peace." 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's dependence on outside 
forces 
finds another graphic expression in the fact that it is seeking 
North-South confrontation in collusion with outside forces while 
refusing to join hands with fellow countrymen who call for a 
solution of the problem of peace and peaceful reunification of 
the country with the concerted effort of the nation. 
  On the pretext of the "nuclear problem" of the North, the 
Kim 
Yong-sam puppet government broke up the North-South dialogue and 
exchange which had taken place under the "fifth and sixth 
republics". 
  It frequently staged large-scale nuclear war exercises 
including the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers in an attempt 
to put the brake on the progress of the DPRK-USA talks for the 
solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. 
Especially, the puppets ran amok to establish an "international 
cooperation system" and have "sanctions" taken against fellow 
countrymen. 
  For the establishment of the "international cooperation 
system," they even opened the rice market of South Korea to the 
U.S. master, wiped off the slate Japanese imperialists' crimes 
in their invasion of Korea in the past and defended Japan's 
nuclear armament and overseas expansion. 
  With this traitorous "government" and traitor left intact in 
South Korea, national unity and peaceful reunification are 
impossible and the nation inevitably falls a victim to outside 
forces. 
  The South Korean people will never tolerate the traitorous 
"government" of Kim Yong-sam turning the back on the nation and 
depending on outside forces.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- Yu Mi-yong, 
chairperson of the Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu 
Party, issued a statement on January 5 supporting the policy of 
national reunification clarified by the great leader President 
Kim Il-song in his New Year address for 1994. 
  "It is an intolerable national misfortune that our 
homogeneous nation who has glorified its 5,000 year long history 
with Tangun as its father is still living, divided into the 
North and South for nearly half a century, failing to remove the 
tragedy of national split forced on it by outside forces," she 
said, adding that the cause of national reunification must be 
achieved at an early date to meet the unanimous, ardent 
aspirations of the whole nation and hand down the reunified 
country to the posterity. 
  She pointed out that the South Korean authorities, however, 
ignoring the DPRK's magnanimous proposals and sincere efforts, 
have staged large-scale military exercises against the DPRK 
frequently in collusion with foreign forces and have been 
jeopardizing North-South relations by clamouring for "military 
counteraction" and an "international cooperation system" on the 
pretext of its "nuclear problem". 
  "This shows that the South Korean chief executive's 
`promise' 
to place the nation above anything else in the discussion of the 
reunification question was a sheer lie and that the present 
`regime' too is a flunkeyist, traitorous `regime', an 
anti-national fascist `regime' and a separatist `regime' that 
does not differ from the successive military dictatorial 
regimes," she said, and stressed: 
  "If the South Korean authorities really want a solution of 
the national reunification question, they must, though 
belatedly, stop their anti-national acts to harm and stifle the 
same fellow countrymen by dancing to the `nuclear' tune of 
outside forces and must turn to the stand of national 
independence, not hinder the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula from being solved fairly through DPRK-USA talks but 
join in the efforts to achieve national reconciliation and unity 
in response to our 10-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation."

Korea in his New Year address said it is the United States that 
has created the fictitious `doubt about nuclear development by 
the North', and it is the United States that has actually 
shipped nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula and has been 
threatening the Korean people. 
  "Pressure or threat will have no effect on the Korean 
people, 
President Kim Il-song said, warning that such an attempt may 
invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to the problem. 
  "He stressed that the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula 
must on any account be settled through Korea-U.S. talks." 
  The Malaysian paper STAR January 2 quoted President Kim 
Il-song as saying "since a joint statement has been adopted by 
Korea and the United States, the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula can be settled fairly if both sides keep and implement 
the principles that have been agreed upon." 
  The Malaysian radio and television and newspaper NEW STRAITS 
TIMES also reported the same content.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- A scientific 
symposium was held here Wednesday upon the lapse of 30 years 
since the great leader President Kim Il-song published the 
immortal classical work "Problems Related to the Development of 
the Korean Language." 
  Speeches were made at the symposium on the subjects "the 
immortal classical work of the respected leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song `Problems Related to the Development of the Korean 
Language' is a highly important work that brought a new turn in 
the development of the working-class linguistic theory," "Theory 
on relations between language and nation propounded by the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song," "Successful education in-mother 
tongue is vital to the development of the national language and 
improvement of lingual life," "Role of our party's mass media in 
the development of the national language and the improvement of 
the lingual life," etc. 
  The speakers said the work of President Kim Il-song was a 
precious programme which comprehensively systematized the 
chuche-based linguistic theory and gave perfect answers to all 
the theoretical and practical questions arising in solving the 
problems related to the national language. 
  They noted that President Kim Il-song, basing himself on a 
scientific analysis of the important position of the questions 
of a nation and its language in the socio-political life, gave a 
new classical formulation that language is one of the features 
which characterize a nation. 
  They said the work brought a new turn in the development of 
the linguistic theory of the working class as it, on the basis 
of a scientific exposition of the law-governing course of the 
development of the socialist national language and its factor, 
the social and historical conditions of the development of the 
national language and those in charge of its development, gave 
flawless answers as to the fundamental principles and concrete 
ways of developing the language and other theoretical and 
practical questions arising in solving the problems related to 
the national language at present. 
  They stressed that the chuche-orientated linguistic theory 
propounded by the great leader President Kim Il-song had been 
developed in depth and completed as the linguistic programme of 
our age, the era of independence, by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il.

  [Text] On 27 December, the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry [MITI] made firm its plan to discontinue voluntary 
restraints on automobile exports to the United States at the end 
of the current fiscal year. MITI has made its decision in 
consideration not only of the fact that voluntary export 
restraints [VER] have become meaningless due to decreased auto 
exports from Japan as a result of expanded local production in 
the United States by Japanese automakers, but also of the fact 
that it was agreed at GATT's new round of multilateral trade 
talks (Uruguay Round) that VER, among other measures, would be 
abolished by 1999. In view of expected progress in the 
Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks in which the automobile 
trade is one of the key issues, MITI plans to make an official 
decision as early as January 1994. 
  To ease Japanese-U.S. trade frictions over automobiles, a 
quota of 1.68 million units was imposed on Japan regarding its 
VER for fiscal year 1981. The quota was increased to 2.3 
million units thereafter, but because actual exports began 
dropping after peaking in fiscal year 1986, the quota was cut to 
1.65 million units in fiscal year 1992. It has been kept at the 
same level for the current fiscal year. Actual automobile 
exports, however, remained below the quota from fiscal year 1987 
and fell to 1.56 million units in fiscal year 1992. Thus, VER 
have become meaningless. 
  Concerning the quota, MITI has so far maintained that it 
"wishes to have the measure abolished because it runs contrary 
to the principles of free trade." But MITI has been forced to 
continue VER due to expected objections from the U.S. automobile 
industry should MITI decide to discontinue them. While local 
production of Japanese automobiles in the United States has 
increased, however, Japanese export models have weakened in 
terms of their price competitiveness due to the yen's 
appreciation. The U.S. Big Three automakers have also regained 
their competitiveness. Therefore, MITI has judged that Japanese 
automobile exports would not increase immediately even if VER 
were to be lifted. 
  Concerning VER, the United States has ostensibly maintained 
that "it is a voluntary measure taken by the Japanese automobile 
industry, and the U.S. Government has no part in it." It is 
said that the issue will not be taken up in negotiations at the 
Japanese-U.S. framework trade talks regarding the automobile and 
auto parts sector to be settled before the summit meeting in 
February. MITI plans to eventually decide to discontinue VER 
while monitoring progress in the negotiations, and then to 
present its proposal to the U.S. Government.

  [Text] Reviewing this year's [1993] diplomacy, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] has prepared a report 
entitled "Review and Outlook of the International Situation," in 
which predictions are made on focal points of 1994. The report 
cites two points -- Japan-U.S. relations and North Korea's 
nuclear development issue -- as Japan's largest diplomatic tasks 
in 1994. 
  The government thinks the outcome of Japan-U.S. 
comprehensive 
talks -- the main topic at the Japan-U.S. summit talks slated to 
be held on 11 February next year -- will have a significant 
impact on future ties between the two countries. On the basis 
of this understanding, the government plans to exert all-out 
efforts to work out measures to deal with Japan-U.S. relations. 
On the other hand, the government plans to immediately resume 
negotiations for normalization of diplomatic ties between Japan 
and the DPRK once an agreement is reached at U.S.-DPRK 
negotiations. 
  The leaders of Japan and the United States have held summit 
talks twice; the first meeting was in September this year when 
the UN General Assembly was held, and the second meeting was in 
November during the unofficial summit talks of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) ministerial conference. However, a 
MOFA source offered a severe view, saying: "The leaders of both 
countries merely exchanged yells [as published] at their 
previous two summit talks. They will directly face the problems 
and have a dispute at the February summit. It will be a tough 
summit meeting." The government wants to lay a new foundation 
for improving bilateral relations by seeking agreements 
regarding "government procurement, autos and auto parts, and 
insurance," which are priority matters at the comprehensive 
economic talks. 
  On the issue of North Korean nuclear development, the 
government wants to start working-level discussions in Beijing 
for resumption of the Japan-DPRK negotiations which were 
suspended in November last year, should North Korea agree at 
U.S.-DPRK negotiations to accept nuclear inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  However, the government is determined at the same time that 
it has no choice but to firmly maintain the fundamental stance 
of cooperating with both the United States and the ROK in 
imposing economic sanctions against North Korea should the 
U.S.-DPRK negotiations be ruptured. 
  Regarding Japan's policy toward Russia, the report says that 
although there was a sign after President Yeltsin's visit to 
Japan in October that negotiations on the northern territorial 
issue would take a turn for the better, the political situation 
in Russia will be in a fluid state once again due to the 
emergence of the Liberal Democratic extreme right nationalist 
party which was a big winner in the December election for the 
new federal council. The report is leaning to the pessimistic 
view that stagnation of the territorial negotiations is 
unavoidable.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito by </F>
NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Japan's diplomacy is expected to be 
forced to go through fundamental changes in the post-Cold War 
international community. I would like to ask you about a 
typical post-Cold War case. Would you give your view and 
analysis of the situation in the DPRK? 
  [Saito] The DPRK is the only nation with which Japan has yet 
to settle post-war issues. There is no change in Japan's desire 
to normalize diplomatic relations with the DPRK. There is a 
possibility, however, that the DPRK, a geographically close 
neighbor of Japan, is developing nuclear weapons and this is a 
serious issue. Japan cannot tolerate DPRK development of nuclear 
weapons. We strongly hope that suspicions about the DPRK's 
development of nuclear arms will be cleared up in the U.S.-DPRK 
talks. We hope the talks will settle the DPRK nuclear issue one 
way or another. 
  [Reporter] It has been pointed out that any crisis in the 
Korean peninsula will inevitably lead to a change in Japan-U.S. 
security arrangements. 
  [Saito] Japan-U.S. security arrangements will not be 
affected by any crisis on the Korean peninsula and we are not 
concerned about that. The military threat to Japan has not yet 
disappeared (even following the end of the Cold War). Japan 
cannot protect itself from various crises by its own power 
alone. The significance of Japan-U.S. security arrangements 
will remain unless a change occurs in Japan's ability to protect 
itself. Japan-U.S. security arrangements keep other Asian 
nations free from security concerns and their effect will remain 
unchanged. 
  [Reporter] Looking at Japan's security, there are China and 
Russia, both of them political and military superpowers. 
  [Saito] Japan will host the ASEAN regional forum next year. 
I think it is right ASEAN foreign ministers and their 
counterparts from China and Russia hold talks to discuss the 
regional security issue. Japan will urge both China and Russia 
to hold security talks with Japan. Japan should promote these 
security talks and the ASEAN security talks simultaneously. 
  [Reporter] Regional security considerations aside, will the 
Asian and Pacific region not move toward forming an economic 
bloc? 
  [Saito] The region may move toward forming such an economic 
bloc. It is to be expected that European nations will watch 
closely the strengthening of relations between the United States 
and the member nations of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation 
Conference [APEC], but there is nothing for them to worry about. 
The European Community (EC) wants to maintain its relationship 
with APEC whereby it attends APEC conferences as an observer. 
Japan supports this. 
  [Reporter] With the Cold War behind us, Japan's bid for a 
seat on the UN Security Council is becoming more realistic. 
  [Saito] I believe Japan is qualified to join the UN Security 
Council as a permanent member. If an international consensus 
forms on Japanese membership, Japan should go along with it. We 
must not be impatient, however. 
  [Reporter] There is also the question of participation by 
the Self-Defense Forces in such UN and multinational forces that 
fought in the Gulf war. Should the government not make clear 
its view on this before the question comes up again? 
  [Saito] The best thing would be to have the issue debated 
and then a decision made once conclusions from the debate have 
been drawn. In any case, however, it is clear that Japan can 
only take actions are permitted by the Constitution, even if it 
is admitted to the UN Security Council as a permanent member. 
If Japan becomes a permanent member of the UN Security Council, 
the UN body cannot ask Japan to do what is prohibited by the 
Constitution. I do not mean Japan cannot join the UN Security 
Council before deciding the limits of its participation. As far 
as the multinational forces are concerned, my personal view is 
that it would be difficult for Japan to join them. 
  [Reporter] Other nations hope Japan will participate in the 
UN peacekeeping operations in former Yugoslavia. 
  [Saito] Some argue that as Yasushi Akashi has been appointed 
the UN peacekeeping operations representative in the former 
Yugoslavia, Japan should do something. I cannot agree with the 
argument, though. It is clear, however, that if the situation 
there is left uncontrolled, it could get worse. A political 
decision will be made on Japan's participation in UN 
peacekeeping operations after we are clear whether Japan's 
participation is compatible with the Peacekeeping Operations 
Cooperation Law. I mean the government will begin examining the 
possibility of participation if it conforms to the Peacekeeping 
Operations Cooperation Law and the United Nations makes a 
request to that effect.

  [Text] Believing that some extraordinary events will 
probably occur in the DPRK this year, the government intends to 
watch carefully the country and work closer in cooperation with 
the United States, South Korea, and China. Washington is 
considering imposing economic sanctions on the DPRK together 
with other UN members if the U.S.-DPRK talks on suspected 
nuclear weapons development by North Korea are "deadlocked" 
(according to a government source). It is certain that if the 
United Nations decides on the sanctions, Japan will be asked to 
cooperate. 
  Several years ago, a senior government official secretly 
said: "In the near future, North Korea will suddenly discharge 
its military power or will collapse because of economic 
difficulties. It is unlikely that the transfer of power from 
President Kim Il-song to Secretary Kim Chong-il will be made 
smoothly." Although his opinion did not represent the 
government view at the time, it has become common in the last 
year because of various behaviors by North Korea. 
  The DPRK announced last March that it would withdraw from 
the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Also, it keeps 
rejecting nuclear inspectations by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). Moreover, it succeeded in the 
experimental launch of its "Nodong 1" intermediate range 
ballistic missile over the Sea of Japan last May, continuing to 
exert its energy in missile development. As for its economic 
policy, the DPRK, for the first time, admitted that its third 
seven-year economic plan failed. At the same time, the country 
has established a new personnel lineup with the Kim family on 
top. 
  Japan has so far analyzed that North Korea is "seriously" 
considering developing nuclear weapons (according to a Defense 
Agency source). It has taken the position that the issue of 
suspected nuclear weapons development by the DPRK should be 
resolved through dialogue. Based on this stand, Japan is 
carefully watching the developments in the U.S.-DPRK talks and 
is willing to help make progress in the North-South dialogue. 
It has also given political consideration to the issue. As 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said: "North Korea should not be 
isolated from the rest of the world." 
  It is true that the actual state of North Korea is not 
clearly known. Tokyo depends on information given by Washington 
to know about the DPRK. However, it is said that the U.S. 
information represents differing views on the country. 
  The government thinks: "It is possible that the DPRK has 
developed something similar to a nuclear weapon. But it will 
take another two or three years for the DPRK to be able to load 
nuclear warheads onto missiles and launch them at Japan" 
(according to a Foreign Ministry source). Even so, it cannot be 
denied that the situation has become tense. 
  Nonetheless, the Japanese Government remains negative about 
imposing economic sanctions on the DPRK.

  [Text] During a 22 December news conference, Tatsuro 
Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor Corporation, disclosed that 
Toyota was examining auto production in Mexico to prepare for a 
huge economic zone to be created under NAFTA, which will take 
effect in January next year. He also said the company was 
considering production in Argentina, too. At home, Toyota will 
renovate old factories and review a list of items to be produced 
at these factories, he said. 
  Concerning production in Mexico, President Toyoda merely 
said: "We are studying it." Meanwhile, Toyota Vice President 
Masaharu Tanaka met with visiting Mexican presidential aide 
Gomez on the morning of 22 December and was briefed on how North 
and Central American markets would expand after NAFTA takes 
effect. Although President Toyoda said "we have not decided on 
details," the company will promote the study of making inroads 
into Mexico. 
  Toyota once set up a local production system in Mexico in 
the 
sixties. Also, it dispatched a survey team to Mexico last 
October, indicating a desire to make inroads into the country. 
  Nissan Motor Company has a production base in Mexico. 
Although Japanese car manufacturers are worried that the ratio 
of parts to be procured locally might be raised following the 
effectuation of NAFTA, they are expected to make full-scale 
inroads into Mexico because of the market's bright future. 
  Toyota is currently promoting a feasibility study in 
Argentina. In 1992, it exported 1,300 vehicles to the country. 
To increase the volume of exports to Argentina, it is necessary 
to establish a production base there, Toyota believes. 
  At home, Takaoka and Tsutsumi Factories in Toyoda city are 
subject to renovation. The two factories manufacture passenger 
cars like Corolla and Corona. Toyota is said to plan to remodel 
them into ones for parts production. 
  Concerning prices of Toyota cars in the U.S. market, 
President Toyoda said: "The appreciation of the yen is still 
continuing. We have to take this into consideration." His 
remark suggests that Toyota will further raise the prices of its 
products in the U.S. market in the near future. 
  Explaining Toyota's long-term sales and production plans, 
Toyoda stressed that the company would vigorously promote 
overseas production, saying: "I hope we will sell 6 million 
vehicles (in the world market) before we enter the 21st century."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata by SANKEI </F>
SHIMBUN; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [SANKEI SHIMBUN] The geopolitical environment in 
the Asia-Pacific region is undergoing changes with events taking 
place such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
summit meeting, which was held for the first time last autumn. 
What is your view on this point? 
  [Hata] While attending the Seattle meeting, I truly realized 
the Asia-Pacific region has entered a new era. Acknowledging 
such reality, Japan must actively make contributions. It is a 
fact that nations in the Asia-Pacific region are in various 
stages of economic development. What is important is that Japan 
should play the role of mediator in various aspects toward 
helping developing countries, being attentive to their needs. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] What is your view of the East Asia Economic 
Caucus (EAEC) project proposed by ASEAN? 
  [Hata] ASEAN has indicated that the EAEC would be a 
consultative group within APEC. However, this is a sensitive 
issue as the Asia-Pacific region draws much interest as the 
center of global economic growth. I feel it is important that 
Australia and New Zealand (both of which are currently excluded 
from the EAEC) be included. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] How does Japan plan to approach the ASEAN 
Regional Forum which will be established this year? 
  [Hata] There is a tendency to compare this with the CSCE, 
but 
I doubt there is any need to rush it (setting up a framework). 
However, it is very important to help gradually build such 
projects by promoting a security dialogue in the Asia-Pacific 
region with the PRC and Russia joining the effort. The world 
trend is that nations in a certain region act together to settle 
problems that occur there, and this idea is beginning to bud in 
Asia, too. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] In consideration of security in Asia, the 
issue of suspected nuclear development in the DPRK (North Korea) 
cannot be avoided. What is your view on this point? 
  [Hata] It has become an unstable factor for all of Asia. If 
North Korea should withdraw its decision to pull out of the 
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and agree to conduct 
talks with the ROK, Japan and other neighboring countries would 
be able to help it. The unstable factor would be removed if 
North Korea opened up its door. 
  [SANKEI SHIMBUN] There is still a noted tendency among Asian 
nations to take up the issue of Japan's World War II 
responsibilities. What is your view on this point? 
  [Hata] Following a series of speeches of apology by Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the atmosphere among Asian nations 
has certainly changed. During the Liberal Democratic Party's 
rule, Japanese words (of apology) were very difficult to 
understand, failing to straightforwardly convey Japanese 
feelings and consequently leaving the Asian people concerned 
bitter. We must also realize that there are some people in the 
United States who actually still feel Japan will eventually 
develop nuclear weapons. I feel it is meaningful for us to once 
again resolve to build peace in reflection of our past mistakes.

  [Text] With 1993 coming to an end, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs [MOFA] has compiled its retrospective of the 
international situation in 1993, and the outlook for 1994. It 
predicts the international situation in 1994 will remain 
"untransparent, unstable, and uncertain," as in 1993 during 
which the world went through ambiguous developments in a period 
of transition, experiencing the impact of the collapse of the 
bipolar Cold War structure and global economic recession. 
  The ministry considers the following points warrant Japan's 
attention: 1) the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected 
nuclear development and its domestic political and economic 
trends; 2) action that Russian reformists will take against the 
rise of conservatives and ultranationalist forces; and 3) 
whether the PRC will make a smooth transition to a "post-Deng 
Xiaoping era." 
  Concerning foreign relations, the ministry predicts that 
Japanese-U.S. relations may become more difficult. It has 
judged that while the first turning point will be the 11 
February Japan-U.S. summit meeting, the administration of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, which cannot help but give priority to 
domestic affairs in view of the November off-year election, will 
undoubtedly carry out a results-oriented policy toward Japan. 
The ministry has analyzed that the administration of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, therefore, will be pressed to 
present concrete steps toward resolving the bilateral trade 
imbalance. 
  According to MOFA, two points characterized the 
international 
situation in 1993. The first point was that there emerged a 
strong trend toward reexamining existing political and economic 
systems and traditional policies. As examples, the ministry 
cites the democratization of the former Soviet Union and Eastern 
European nations, as well as their transition to market 
economies, and changes in rule of such major industrialized 
nations as Japan, the United States, and Canada. 
  The ministry also points out that such changes were 
accompanied by growing regionalism, as seen in the enactment of 
the Maastricht Treaty, and completion of the procedures for 
enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
  The MOFA says the second characteristic was that although 
the 
possibility of global warfare lessened, many regional conflicts 
broke out due to ethnic, religious, and territorial disputes. 
The ministry noted that, in addition, a new problem has emerged 
concerning the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction among third world countries. 
  At the same time, the ministry points out that moves have 
been noted in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region toward seeking 
the creation of new security frameworks. However, it maintains 
that since such moves are still in the embryonic stages, various 
developments will continue to take place in 1994.

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion with Isamu Yamashita, president of </F>
Japan-Russia Economic Committee (adviser to Mitsui Shipbuilding, 
top adviser to JR East Japan); Jiro Kawake, vice president of 
Japan-Russia Economic Committee (chairman of Oji Paper); Jiro 
Rokugawa, president of Tokyo Maruichi Trading; Jiro Aiko, 
managing director of Sony Corp.; Kazuo Nukazawa, director of 
Keidanren, moderator; place and date not given] 
  [Text] I. How To View the Current Russian Economy 
  [Nukazawa] The Keidanren's Japan-Russia Economic Committee 
and the Russia-Japan Economic Committee, which centers on the 
Russian Industrialists and Enterpreneurs Federation, held their 
first joint conference in Moscow for four days beginning 2 June 
1993, and discussed a variety of problems based on the present 
new situation. The Japan committee also made efforts to grasp 
the realities of Russia's economy and civilian life through 
visits to plants and a tour of the city of St. Petersburg. These 
activities were very helpful in increasing mutual understanding 
between the two nations, and progress was made concerning a 
number of problems. 
  Opinions about Russia's present economic conditions were 
sharply divided between those who perceive an underlying 
strength and those who see utter confusion. What are your 
opinions? 
  [Yamashita] Russia's economy is said to be gigantic and 
similar to an elephant. It is not a healthy elephant, but an 
ailing elephant. We are small and have absolutely no idea why it 
is flailing its trunk, or in which direction it is walking. 
Although we attempt to view the present condition of the 
elephant itself, it is extremely difficult to get an overall 
view. 
  At present, the Yeltsin administration seems likely to 
endure 
for a while longer. Judging from the national referendum held in 
April, we can perhaps conclude that he still holds the reins of 
power. Conversely, we cannot debate anything unless we establish 
such a premise. 
<H5>  The Russian People Are Beginning To Enjoy Freedom </H5>
  [Kawake] I believe it is realistic to say that present-day 
Russia is difficult to understand. However, I received the 
impression that, still, Russia is moving in a forward direction 
in its own way. The strongest indication is the bright look on 
the faces of the people we saw in walking through the streets 
and in the department stores. The young girls wear miniskirts 
and look stylish, which seems somehow to be a change. 
  I believe that they have begun to enjoy "freedom." Despite 
the high prices of goods, with the money they earn, they can buy 
anything without forming queues. This is natural for us, but it 
is a great change for them. Their previous custom of buying food 
and clothing at the state stores was similar to our distribution 
of rationed goods during the war. Today, however, buying goods 
at the GUM stores means shopping at one's option despite the 
high prices. 
  I do not think that the "freedom" experienced by the people 
can be easily taken away. 
  [Rokugawa] I also felt a brightness in their future. We 
stayed in Moscow for a week before the conference, and later for 
about a week in Vladivostok. It was the season of new greenness, 
and the looks on the faces of the people walking by were 
etremely cheerful. We met many corporate leaders who were really 
gungho. They were full of ideas and eager to test them, saying 
that they would like to trade and cooperate with us in joint 
ventures. 
  After returning to Japan, I talked with Director Hisao 
Kanamori of the Russia-East Europe Economic Research Institute. 
He said that Russia's economy has declined compared to the same 
period a year earlier, but it has improved when the 
January-April period of this year is compared with the same 
period last year, for example, and it made me feel optimistic. 
Japan-Russia trade also has shown some definite signs of 
monetary improvement during January-April. 
<H5>  Russia's Present "Dual Economy" </H5>
  [Aiko] From a macro viewpoint, after World War II, India, 
the 
USSR, and China--socialist nations that were under planned 
economic management, that is, three regions with the world's 
largest populations--were shut inside the socialist freezer. The 
"energy" was released with the collapse of the system, and the 
planned economy shifted to a market economy. As to which of the 
three will get on track first, it is China. Next is India, and I 
believe that today's Russia will require some time. I believe 
that, in the future, every phenomenon of 21st century politics 
and economics will result in an upheaval due to the "energy" 
released in the three regions, and will be prescribed by it. 
  The present state of Russia's economy seems to be a dual 
economy in which coexist an economy of the heavy industrial 
sector, which has been encumbered by the shadow of the state-run 
corporation, and a real economy, similar to the black market 
economy in Japan immediately after the war. In looking at the 
sector centered on the heavy industrial state-run corporation, 
we become extremely pessimistic, but the real economy at the 
grassroots is considerably more sound. I feel that the views 
differ according to where the focus is placed. I received the 
impression that confusion arises when observing Russia's 
economy, due to the problem of where to focus one's sight. 
  [Nukazawa] What are your views on the observation that, 
despite the privatization of the state-run corporations, it will 
result in monopolies that deny the advantages of competition? 
  [Kawake] In a careful consideration of the nation called 
Russia, companies in the real sense apparently did not exist 
during the more than 200 years that include the tsarist era, and 
I believe that a major problem lies in how Russia without such 
experience should learn about the market economy. It is true 
that, despite privatization of the state-run corporation, only a 
monopolistic corporation will result. I believe that it is the 
responsibility of Japan and other nations to advise them on how 
to go about it and to think for them, which is more important 
than capital assistance. 
  Regarding the formation of a framework, Japan and Germany 
have a variety of experiences. Both have lost in war, 
experienced inflation, and privatized state-run enterprises. I 
believe that, as Russia's neighbor, Japan should provide such 
assistance. 
<H5>  Japan's Experiences Effective for Russia </H5>
  [Nukazawa] I heard recently in Moscow that, among the 49 
foreign advisers in the Russian Government, 48 were advisers 
sent by the United States. However, in the case of the United 
States, its experience in promoting the economy happened a long, 
long time ago, and I believe that it is more useful to tell them 
about Japan's experiences. It is important to send advisers from 
Japan. 
  [Aiko] I believe that there are two major problems 
concerning 
the current reforms. 
  First, the effect of the same prescription is totally the 
reverse, depending on when there is surplus supply capacity and 
when there is a shortage. You say that virtually all of the 
advisers are Americans, but the Americans have never experienced 
an absolute shortage of supply capacity. Looking at Russia's 
recent circumstances, it appears that they are trying to apply 
the common sense of a nation with surplus supply to a nation 
with a shortage of supply. 
  Regardless of price liberalization, there is no way for it 
to 
become an incentive for a rise in supply. If prices are 
liberalized when there is an absolute supply shortage, goods 
will sell regardless of how high the prices, so the prices will 
merely climb without a rise in supply. Therefore, under such 
circumstances, I believe that it is necessary to retain the 
supply or control system to some extent, and to gradually 
liberalize in accordance with an upgrading of the supply system. 
  Second, the previous system concentrated outstanding people 
of talent in the Communist Party and formed a bureaucracy. In 
one aspect, due to a personnel shortage, ignoring these people 
and attempting to press for reforms will not work smoothly. In 
fact, they must be asked to work together to achieve reform. In 
Japan during the Meiji Restoration, the detectives and officials 
of the Tokugawa shogunate were used adeptly for continuity. 
During the last war also, in the process of discarding control, 
the prewar government organization was used intact. Russia has 
had a world-class bureaucratic system, and I believe that it 
should consider pushing for reforms by cleverly using it with 
its cooperation. 
  Regarding these two points, we could probably provide unique 
advice by utilizing Japan's experience. 
  [Yamashita] If we narrow down the areas in concrete terms, 
Russia has state-designated industrial product standards called 
GOST [All-Union State Standard], which is like the JIS [Japan 
Industrial Standards]. This is a huge organization that has more 
than 50,000 members in the capital area and about 38,000 members 
in the outlying regions. However, despite the large number of 
members, application of the standards is quite lagging, and 
Russia's standards have been omitted from the joint standards of 
the ISO [International Standards Organization] which was started 
by Europe. If it is unable to win ISO approval, as a practical 
problem, Russian products, except military weapons, will no 
longer be exportable to Europe. Therefore, if it adopts a joint 
approach with Japan, which is slow to conform to ISO standards, 
it will probably be able to win approval. 
  As this example illustrates, I believe that it is more 
useful 
to exchange advice on a specific theme. 
  [Nukazawa] However, perhaps because it has been exposed to 
the view from Europe and the United States that "Japan has not 
really become a market economy, and therefore it is not 
advisable to learn from Japan," there was an atmosphere of an 
element of caution against learning from Japan, was there not? 
  [Kawake] Conversely, there was a view that, for Russia's 
sake, it is easier to accept the Japan-style economy than the 
U.S.-style, and that it would serve as a reference. The problem 
of privatization of the national railways is one not found in 
the United States, nor is inflation in the United States so 
conspicuous. I believe that Japan will of greater reference in 
various ways. 
<H5>  II. What Will Become of Russia's Economic Reconstruction? </H5>
  [Nukazawa] In any case, inflation is quite serious. Today, 
the dollar has risen much higher than 1,000 rubles, and it is 
apparently rumored in Moscow that it may go as high as 3,000 
rubles between this fall and the yearend. 
  The price of coal, which was deregulated on 1 July, 
instantly 
doubled, and is expected to rise six- to eightfold in the near 
future. Incidentally, the coal miner's monthly wage will rise to 
about 400,000 rubles or 10 times the general wage. With the 
price of coal climbing, the prices of steel and other principal 
raw materials will rise drastically. In terms of dollar prices, 
they will surpass international prices. Therefore, if we 
calculate in reverse to correspond with the international 
prices, the ruble will drop considerably. Because the central 
bank is granting state subsidies rampantly, inflation is fed 
constantly. If this continues, one cannot afford to conduct 
business selling rubles in Moscow. I feel that, before talking 
about a market economy, there is a need to expel inflation. 
  [Nukazawa] When I hear about coal, steel, and subsidies, I 
am 
reminded of the postwar declining industries. 
  After the war, Japan restricted foreign exchange 
transactions 
and accumulated foreign currency. However, present-day Russia 
has adopted no measures regarding foreign currency and its 
capital is constantly flowing out. For example, there is 
reportedly $400 billion worth of dollar deposits in New York 
banks. Is it not rather strange that it wants to borrow money 
from foreign countries while leaving that money there? 
  [Rokugawa] Actually, the Russian authorities themselves are 
unable to control and regulate the foreign deposits of residents 
in Russia. In Japan also, there are requests received by the 
Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan [Zenginkyo] not to 
accept such deposits. Based on this, Zenginkyo reportedly has 
sent written requests to its subsidiaries not to accept the 
establishing of accounts with such mysterious Russian funds. 
  [Nukazawa] In Japan since the war, the government has 
strictly supervised the recovery of export payments through the 
standard settlement system, checking how, when, and how much 
payment is made during export, and where it is destined. 
However, Russia is unable to do this. 
  [Aiko] They cannot do it unless they regulate by linking the 
outflow of goods and the flow of funds. The transactions are 
based on formal contracts, and they will be able to regulate to 
some extent if they check the method of payment at the time of 
the contract, and if a bureaucratic system functions to enable 
the bank to back the entire payment. However, under the present 
circumstances, they are unable to do so. 
<H5>  Recovery of Ruble's External Convertibility Still in Future </H5>
  [Rokugawa] In the case of exports to Russia, we dare not 
export without prepayment or a form of barter, but bartering is 
banned in Japan. Therefore, it is conducted under a quasi-barter 
form of advance export by the Russian side. 
  From the standpoint of the ruble's convertibility, both 
Russia and East Europe are confusing the convertibility of the 
nonresident account with the resident account. Japan and the 
West European nations have assiduously worked to promote exports 
after the war, thereby accumulating foreign currency, and have 
not recognized foreign currency holdings by the residents. They 
also took considerable time to liberalize overseas travel. Once 
a sufficient amount of foreign currency was accumulated, they 
first restored the convertibility of accounts for nonresidents 
and eventually the accounts for residents. 
  On the other hand, Russia left it up to the desires of the 
masses. It did not adopt a policy of concentrating foreign 
currency, but first recognized foreign currency holdings by the 
residents. Despite the external nonconvertibility of their 
currency, they restored domestic convertibility between 
residents within Russia. Consequently, their hard-earned foreign 
currency flowed outside, with the volume reportedly totaling $16 
billion or even $20 billion. 
  Therefore, I believe that it should induct comprehensieve 
foreign exchange management, concentrate the foreign currency 
holdings of the residents in the central bank, and then 
liberalize. It is surprising that the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund have completely overlooked guidance 
in these respects concerning foreign exchange policy. Therefore, 
restoration of the external convertibility of the ruble is still 
far in the future. 
  [Kawake] The present cabinet is implementing to a 
considerable degree two policies that could not be implemented 
during the leadership of former Premier Kaidar--i.e. 
tranquilizing the hyperinflation and controlling the central 
bank. By beginning to cope seriously with these aspects, Russia 
is seen as finally lining up on the starting line. Certainly, 
its energy is extremely cheap by international standards. 
Therefore, if Russia itself upgrades its system to cope with the 
extremely difficult task of curbing inflation while raising the 
prices of its energy, I believe it will be important, first of 
all, for everyone to give support and offer advice. 
<H5>  Black Markets, But No Corporations </H5>
  [Nukazawa] Here and there on the street corners in Moscow 
are 
seen foreign exchange trucks which are remodeled buses. The 
people all exchange rubles for marks, francs, and dollars, and 
they deposit the foreign currencies. It is regrettable when the 
people have a low regard for the currency of their own country. 
The foreign exchange brokers, like the postwar black market 
operators (in Japan), reportedly buy and accumulate coupons 
which they trade for stock shares to be issued when the national 
enterprises are privatized. Can sound privatization be realized 
under such conditions? 
  In postwar Japan black marketeers were rampant, but the 
established enterprises also remained. In today's Russia, there 
are black markets but no corporate enterprises. How the other 
advanced nations will support them in this respect is important. 
  If Russia's market economization makes progress, there may 
be 
a stage when further privatization of the national enterprises 
will be attempted. At this stage, however, like postwar Japan 
and Europe, or like the United States following the Great 
Depression, it should aim for economic reconstruction with the 
public sector as the business core. 
  Regarding the mode of management, it could probably bring in 
enterpreneurs from Japan and the United States, and let them 
take over management temporarily. 
<H5>  Outlook of Japan-Russia Economic Relations </H5>
  [Nukazawa] Regarding Japan-Russia economic relations, unpaid 
trade payments and the freezing of foreign investment accounts 
are two problems that weigh heavily and became the focus of 
attention at the recent conference. 
  [Yamashita] The Russian side said that they will be reviewed 
by a committee chaired by Deputy Chairman Shokhin. Although they 
say that it will suffice to pay foreign debts with $150 billion 
worth of foreign currency credits, it is rather difficult for 
the money to be returned when the debtors are nations like Cuba, 
Vietnam, and Angola. It is a hopeless situation to be told all 
of a sudden that "your debtor is Cuba," or "your debtor is 
Angola." 
  [Kawake] We would hope that the Shokhin committee will 
carefully review the method of solving the problem of unpaid 
foreign currency. However, I do not think the Japanese could go 
in to participate in the discussion and suggest ways to go about 
it. The position of the Japan side of the committee is to urge 
and remind, but not to formulate concrete plans. 
  [Nukazawa] Regarding the clarification of authority and the 
transfer of authority to the regions, which were mentioned 
during the era of the Japan-Soviet economic committee, did you 
feel that there has been some progress? 
  Until now, progress was made when the talks were held in 
Moscow, but recently nothing could be achieved in Moscow alone. 
As to whom the talks should be held with, it is the respective 
enterprises or the local governments. However, they have no 
legal backing. In effect, they have no authority. 
  In other words, adequate talks cannot be held in Moscow and, 
although concrete talks can be held at the regional level, they 
have no authority. Therefore, I believe that the direction of 
the debate by the present constitutional council is extremely 
important. If the constitution works out smoothly, not only will 
the president's authority be enhanced to some extent, but the 
regional authority will also be clarified. I believe it is 
important for them to first form the framework. 
  [Aiko] A major problem is that it is not clear who the 
competent persons in charge are. Regarding the 200 or 300 
presidential decrees also, it is not stipulated at all who the 
implementers are, or whether there are any punitive measures, 
and we have heard that no one bothers to obey the presidential 
decrees. 
  [Nukazawa] To begin with, there is apparently no concept 
that 
the infrastructure is the government's responsibility. Perhaps 
they think that everything can be done by the stock company. 
They must clarify the infrastructure of the public sector as 
being responsible, because the basic role of the public sector 
is based on social capital. They are mistaken in thinking that 
such-and-such a port or harbor is the responsibility of 
such-and-such a company. 
  [Kawake] For example, when considering joint ventures, if 
the 
company is asked to build not only a pulp plant but also roads 
and a port, it will not be done. 
  [Nukazawa] There is a similar problem with respect to 
Vietnam. If we say we cannot invest because there is no 
infrastructure, they say: "Well, Japan can build an 
infrastructure for us also." 
  [Yamashita] At least it is inconceivable for a private 
company in Japan to provide such assistance. Unless there is 
clearly an economic profit on this side, a private company 
cannot do it. As you know, the time span is sometimes long and 
sometimes short, and it cannot be done unless there is an 
overall plus for the company. 
<H5>  Japan Must Work for Far East Development </H5>
  [Nukazawa] It depends on the direction of the constitution, 
but if a certain degree of authority is transferred to the 
regions and autonomy is increased, there will probably be a 
arising mood in Japan to work for resources development in the 
Far East. 
  [Kawake] Regions with expansive resources that can be 
reached 
by aircraft concentrate on the regions eastward from Siberia and 
Irkutsk, and east of the Ural region. The Western nations are 
making rapid inroads into western Russia, and entry by Japan 
will not make a conspicuous mark. 
  [Aiko] It is something else if there is no potential in the 
Far East, but there is a potential there in its own right. If 
Russia does nothing and lets the status quo stand, I feel that 
Russia's Far East region will become a center of competition 
between China and Korea. If Russia itself has a certain amount 
of strategy policywise for economic development, there is a 
possibility that more Russians will be transplanted there. Thus, 
for example, Russians who find life unbearable in Central Asia 
and the Baltic countries will be given opportunities for 
employment, and I believe it will be very good politically. 
  [Rokugawa] Japan's support should be a more visible form of 
support rather than through the G-7 or IMF. Particularly 
regarding the Far East region, ports and harbors come first. 
Among those related to the development of the Tumen River in 
East Asia, if we make efforts to improve the port facilities in 
such places as Sarbino [as translitered], Vanino, and Sovetskaya 
Gavan, they will stand out. Or, in view of the deterioration of 
the Siberian Railway, I believe there are many things we can do, 
such as improving the infrastructure of railway transportation. 
Or, since it is a cold region, if we construct something like 
the Tokyo Dome with a wholesale market, a supermarket and an 
amusement center inside, it would probably be greatly 
appreciated. 
  [Yamashita] Without transportation, construction requiring a 
huge volume of materials would not be feasible in European 
Russia. In that case, products that use less materials and are 
easily transportable must be produced in European Russia. In 
that sense, the upgrading of transport routes is urgently needed. 
  [Nukazawa] If the Far East builds a solid position as a 
resource supply source for Japan, it will be very good for 
Japan's security. 
<H5>  A Realistic Investment Plan </H5>
  [Kawake] After all, Japan itself should set priorities 
regarding investment, trade and various development plans. 
Russia is asking for projects worh tens of billions of yen. It 
would be more realistic to take an approach toward small-scale 
and really necessary projects, or to figure out how the present 
facilities can be remodeled. 
  [Rokugawa] When we received a request for a survey on the 
conversion of the Bulgarian military facilities to civilian use, 
we asked Juki Corporation, the sewing machine maker which has 
experience in this aspect, to conduct a review of various local 
surveys, we found, for instance, that it is technically feasible 
to produce 100,000 pieces of machines and equipment annually. 
However, they say that they can sell 10,000 pieces, leaving 
90,000 pieces which they want us to sell overseas. However, we 
do not have the confidence to sell 90,000 pieces outside of 
Bulgaria. Stymied by this, the idea was dropped. It is quite a 
task when production is not possible without our thinking about 
marketing and sales for them. 
  Therefore, regarding conversion of military facilities to 
civilian use, they should not talk about such large-scale 
projects as artificial satellites, but utilize the munitions 
plants in the environs of Khabarovsk. For example, their casting 
technology is reputed to be extremely good, so if Japan consigns 
production of mechanical equipment and parts like flanges and 
buys up the entire volume, or initially has them produce simple 
communications facilities on a small scale, or seeks cooperation 
on conversion of simple military facilities to civilian use, I 
believe Russia will appreciate it. Conversion of high-level 
military facilities on a grand scale is too costly and extremely 
difficult to materialize, and it is clear from the standpoint of 
productivity and cost that their products cannot possibly 
compete with the products of Europe and the United States. 
  [Kawake] I believe that, in terms of the present relations 
with Russia, it is important to understand the present 
conditions. We must go over there to conduct fact-finding 
surveys in order to formulate some kind of concrete plan. 
Further feasibility studies are also a prerequisite. 
  [Rokugawa] When we went to a munitions plant in the 
Vladivostok suburbs where they are working on general 
telecommunications called "Radio Pribor" [phonetic], we were 
told that we were the 98th company from Japan. It indicates how 
many companies in Japan are conducting studies. They probably 
all investigated and found it difficult to handle, so they gave 
up. 
  [Nukazawa] Russia has broad territorial lands and is rich in 
rsources, so the potentials are great. However, it is deterred 
by its legacies from the past, so it is probably necessary for 
us to advise them and make smooth circulation possible. However, 
it is difficult to know where to begin. 
<H5>  Image of Russia as a Great Power Must Be Dropped </H5>
  [Yamashita] The problem is that the Russian side is not very 
receptive to advice. They probably believe that they are smart 
enough. In any case, all they want from Japan now is money. 
  [Aiko] When we listen to people in charge of projects for 
overseas advancement, I believe the greatest point in a minus 
sense is pride. Where pride exists, the situation is difficult. 
Once that pride is put aside, the rest seems to go smoothly. In 
a region which has previously produced TV sets, there is a fixed 
concept of TV production and, if we try to introduce a 
completely different method, there is terrific resistance. 
However, in a region where they produce nothing except farm 
products, there is no resistance, but a receptive attitude 
toward new technology as is. In that sense, because Russia has a 
high-tech industry in its own right and also a high level of 
technical education, it is probably difficult for them to ask 
for advice. 
  [Rokugawa] As a historical and diplomatic power, Russia has 
looked down on Japan for a long time and, unless such power 
consciousness is dropped, I do not believe that they can humble 
themselves and ask for advice. 
  [Kawake] The Russian side approaches us by asking whether we 
have an interest in their project. They do not say what they 
would like to do, but what they want us to do. Because they 
demand what our interests are, it is difficult for us to reply. 
  [Nukazawa] Even when we go to East Europe and Vietnam, they 
say that many people come from Japan to see, but the talks are 
not fruitful at all. Do you mean that the reason is on the other 
side? 
  [Rokugawa] The Japanese side is very cautious, as you know. 
We take pains to check before we invest. 
  [Kawake] The Americans often tell us that the Japanese are 
not very decisive. However, once we decide, we follow through. 
According to the Russians, the Americans invest very quickly, 
but they also pull out quickly. Therefore, each side has its 
merits and shortcomings. 
  [Yamashita] From Russia's viewpoint, they receive numerous 
inquiries from America. 
  [Nukazawa] That point is important. Unless they understand 
the difference, they get the impression that we go over merely 
to browse and do not buy anything. 
<H5>  Take Time and Start From the Feasible Aspects </H5>
  [Kawake] Judging from my experience of having been interned 
in Sakhalin, the Soviet system is bad, but the Russians people 
are extremely nice, once you get to know them. Therefore, I 
believe that it is vital to build human relations. However, the 
remaining vestiges of the old system obstruct the forming of 
human relations. 
  [Rokugawa] It will be better appreciated by the other side 
if 
we help them when they need it. After all, Japan has the most in 
terms of personnel, money, goods and technology. I feel that, at 
this stage, it will be more profitable for Japan's future if we 
start by giving support and adopt the posture of solving various 
issues including the problem of the Northern Territories. 
  [Yamashita] In such a case, based on Japan's present 
situation, information on problems of the Far East region is 
received relatively easily. Therefore, it is more practical to 
begin with the solution of such issues, and it will probably be 
more effective vis-a-vis the people of the region also. It is 
with such an intent that we are offering railway passenger cars 
for use in Sakhalin. 
  [Rokugawa] Also, it is a problem when they rampantly throw 
nuclear wastes and bombshells into the Japan Sea. There should 
be some change in order to eradicate such actions. 
  [Kawake] There are definitely problems in Japan-Russia 
relations. In any case, it is a nation that can be reached by 
plane in just over an hour, so I believe that, basically, 
emphasis should be placed on our relations with them. At the 
same time, it is of course important to take time and to start 
with projects which are feasible. 
  [Aiko] Apart from economics and politics, Russia is a very 
nice country. 
  [Nukazawa] Certainly, it is a wonderful country in terms of 
its literature, music, ballet and sports. Also, the individual 
Russian is a warm person with humane touches. Thank you all very 
much.

  [Text] On 3 January a source specializing in international 
military affairs said Russian nuclear-powered submarines had 
resumed their operations in the Sea of Japan last December, 
almost as if Russia had returned to the Cold War era. In the 
Atlantic, the Russian Navy has also resumed missile launching 
exercises, long-term exercises of aircraft carriers, and patrol 
operations. In connection with the rise of "Russian 
nationalism" observed in the last parliamentary elections, 
Western nations are concerned about these Russian moves. 
  Operations of a Russian submarine were observed twice in 
early and late December. Both operations lasted for about a 
week, with the operations being undertaken in the Sea of Japan 
to a point 100-kilometers north of Ishikawa Prefecture's Noto 
Peninsula, which is within Japan's economic waters. 
  The type of submarine has not been confirmed since it never 
surfaced during the operation, but judging from various signs, 
it is believed to be a Victor-III class (with a displacement of 
4,800 tons), which is regarded as the "backbone" of Russia's 
fleet attack submarines. 
  The source added: "Such activities of nuclear-powered 
submarines were quite usual in the period of the former Soviet 
Union, but have not been observed during the last couple of 
years since the Russian Federation took over control of the 
Navy." In addition, the source noted: 1) a Udaloy-class 
destroyer (6,700 tons), an Alligator-class landing ship (3,400 
tons), and a Boris Chilikin-class replenishment ship (23,400 
tons) passed through the Korea Strait on 18 November and 
conducted exercises in waters near the gulf after stopping in 
Cam Ranh Bay; 2) a Ropucha-class landing ship (3,600 tons) also 
passed through the strait on 2 December, apparently unloading 
supplies in Cam Ranh Bay; and 3) airplane operations are 
becoming active around Japan. In analysis, the source 
concluded: "The Russian Navy may be resuming full-fledged 
activities after restructuring its lineup through the disposal 
of superannuated ships." 
  In particular, the source said it is noteworthy that such 
operations are observed not only in the Pacific but also in the 
Atlantic simultaneously. On this basis, the source stressed 
that Japan should carefully determine whether the operations are 
based on a new strategy by President Boris Yeltsin or are signs 
of the rise of military authorities after the attack on the 
Russian White House.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhrinovskiy, leader of the Russian </F>
Liberal Democratic Party, by Motohiro Ikeda on 4 January; place 
not given] 
  [Text] Moscow 5 Jan -- Vladimir Zhrinovskiy, leader of the 
Russian Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], which is an extreme 
right wing nationalist party and won big in the recent elections 
for Russia's new Federal Assembly, granted an interview to a 
NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter on 4 January. Regarding the 
northern territories, which is a pending issue between Japan and 
Russia, he explained his intention to maintain a hard-line 
stance, saying that "Russia will never hand over the 
territories." On the other hand, he proposed a plan to improve 
ties between Japan and Russia through economic and industrial 
cooperation, and by mutually allowing people of both countries 
to work in both countries. On the new Federal Assembly, which 
will start on 11 January, he explained his view that he would 
not insist on winning the post of the National Assembly (lower 
house) chairmanship, saying that he would deal with the new 
Federal Assembly session in a flexible manner. The following 
are questions and answers at the interview: 
  [Ikeda] You were repeatedly making hard-line remarks 
regarding the northern territories. Do you still maintain the 
same attitude even after the elections? 
  [Zhrinovskiy] We are not opportunists. We like the Japanese 
people. The Kuril islands have been and will continue to be 
Russian territory. If Japan wants to jointly develop the 
islands, we will welcome it. However, we will never hand over 
the territories to Japan. We must not do that. We must not 
hand over Karelina to Finland, Kishinev (capital of Moldovia) to 
Romania, and Tajikistan to Afghanistan either. 
  [Ikeda] Are you against the idea of improving ties between 
Japan and Russia? 
  [Zhrinovskiy] We do want to cooperate with Japan by all 
means if it wants to have joint economic development with us. 
We will buy unlimited number of Mitsubishi, Honda, and Toyota 
cars. We can sell airplanes in return. Is it not true that 
Japan needs our coal and oil? Moreover, we would like to allow 
100,000 Russians to study in Japan and 100,000 Japanese in 
Russia. 
  We will make Japanese language the second mother tongue on 
the Kuril islands so that the Japanese people will be able to 
freely visit and work there. We should create such an 
environment. We want Japan to create an environment in which 
Russian people will be able to freely work in Hokkaido. Why do 
you have to stick to the territorial issue? If your goal is to 
catch fish, then we will catch fish together and eat it together. 
  [Ikeda] What are you going to demand at the new Federal 
Assembly meetings, which will start on 11 January? 
  [Zhrinovskiy] We won the election. This victory is enough 
for me. I will be pleased to accept the post of the lower house 
chairman if it is offered to me. However, I will not insist on 
it. We are preparing bills, designed to actually improve the 
domestic economic situation, for the new assembly session. 
  [Ikeda] What about the possibility of cooperating with other 
parties? 
  [Zhrinovskiy] Basically, we do not have close ties with 
other parties because they are either radical democrats or 
leftists. Middle-roaders, like us, should not make compromises 
with them. On the contrary, radical political groups, like 
them, should make compromises with us. However, we are ready to 
cooperate with all forces. 
  [Ikeda] Some people are talking about relations between the 
LDP and the KGB. 
  [Zhrinovskiy] They are telling complete lies. I was acting 
as an interpreter. But, they distorted the story. I am merely 
a Russian citizen. They are also saying that my father was a 
Jew. It is also lie. Everything they are saying is propaganda 
designed to distort what we legitimately won.

  [Text] The Defense Agency [DA] decided on 28 December to 
appoint Makoto Sakuma, former chairman of the DA Joint Staff 
Council, as the agency's adviser effective 1 January. Sakuma 
will be the third man to fill this position, succeeding Haruo 
Natsume and Seiki Nishihiro, both of whom also formerly served 
as administrative vice minister of the DA. Sakuma will also be 
the first person from among uniformed DA officials to become DA 
adviser. 
  Sakuma, who was among the first group of persons to graduate 
from the National Defense Academy, has served as chief of staff 
of the Maritime Self-Defense Force and as chairman of the Joint 
Staff Council. He retired in July 1993. 
  In the DA, voices have been raised for some time strongly 
urging that advisers be chosen from among not only civilian 
officials but also from among uniformed officials. Sakuma has 
been chosen apparently in consideration of balancing the 
appointment of civilian and uniformed officials. 
  Moreover, because active debate within the government is 
expected next year over how Japan's national defense program 
should proceed, including a reexamination of the "National 
Defense Program Outline," one senior DA official has stated, "We 
hope that Mr. Sakuma will make good use of his past experience 
as a top uniformed official in charge of managing national 
defense."

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] The Defense Agency has decided on a new defense 
concept which will replace the "Outline of the Defense Program" 
as the basic defense policy for Japan. The key point of the 
concept is that Japan will seek to strengthen its missile 
defense system, looking toward the theater missile defense (TMD) 
system being developed by the United States to deal with 
ballistic missiles. The concept also looks at the question of 
Japan's international contributions, such as participation in UN 
peacekeeping operations (PK0). With respect to the organization 
of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF], it proposes reducing the 
number of ground personnel to less than 150,000. Thus, the 
agency wants to depart from its past strategy of attaching 
importance to the northern areas and of assuming Russia to be a 
hostile nation. It also proposes putting the three services of 
the SDF -- ground, naval, and air force -- under a combined 
operations system. 
  In the spring, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa plans to 
activate a private advisory panel charged with studying the new 
defense concept. For its part, the Defense Agency is studying 
the concept of maintaining "basic defense capabilities" wherein 
the defense capabilities in peacetime are contained at a 
minimum, but can be reinforced in case of emergency. In other 
words, Japan's defense capabilities should be lowered when 
disarmament makes progress throughout the world and when the 
factors of instability diminish in surrounding countries. 
  Specifically in reference to the defense system, the key 
point of the concept lies in its measures against missiles. 
When the current "Outline" was adopted in 1976, there was no 
threat to Japan from medium-range ballistic missiles; hence, the 
air-defense measures were drawn up assuming an invasion by 
aircraft only. However, since then the DPRK (North Korea) has 
successfully test-fired its "Nodong-1" missile, which Japan has 
no capabilities to counter. As such, Japan now wants to state 
its needs in the new defense concept, and improve its 
interception system. 
  It is not yet certain whether Japan will provide 
technological cooperation to the U.S. TMD project. In the 
future, it wants to adopt an interceptor missile system like the 
"THAAD" [Theater High Altitude Area Defense"] system which is 
far, far superior to the Patriot missile. 
  Provisions on the SDF's participation in PKO activities are 
currently presented in a clause under the heading of 
miscellaneous rules within Article 100 of the SDF Law. There 
have been complaints saying "the troops' morale cannot be high 
when they are employed under miscellaneous rules." Hence, the 
agency wants to upgrade PKO missions in the law to the level of 
primary missions by removing the provisions in Article 3 which 
set forth the missions of the SDF. That being the case, the 
agency also finds it necessary to make a clear statement on this 
point in the new defense concept.

  [Text] The Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF] is now 
maintaining 160 military bases (including sub-military bases) 
across the country. The Ground Staff Office [GSO] of the GSDF, 
which has studied ways to shape a new defense policy in tune 
with the changes in the international situation, decided on 2 
January to gradually reduce the 160 military bases to 99, 
beginning in 1996 by closing or integrating 61 military bases, 
or 38 percent of the total GSDF military bases. The scaleback 
plans for the military bases are designed to enhance the 
efficiency of the military bases across the country in parallel 
with cuts in the fixed number of GSDF personnel. The GSO, which 
has already established a principle of locating one military 
base in one prefecture, plans to close or integrate military 
bases in Kushiro, Hokkaido, Shinhatsuda in Niigata Prefecture 
and Tsujiura in Ibaraki Prefecture. 
  The Defense Agency [DA], which plans to cut the fixed number 
of GSDF troops from 180,000 to less than 150,000 when it reviews 
the "Guidelines for the Defense Buildup Plan" which was 
established as Japan's basic defense policy during the Cold War 
era, has directed the GSO to study ways to shape a "desirable 
defense policy." 
  While cuts in the GSDF troops are expected to cause an acute 
shortage of personnel at many military bases, the reduction of 
the defense budget is expected to force the GSDF to seek ways to 
enhance the efficiency of military bases, and the GSO has 
continued to work on the reorganization of GSDF units for more 
than six months. 
  It has been pointed out that about one-third of the 160 GSDF 
military bases are manned by less than 500 troops, progress in 
upgrading their facilities remains sluggish, and the efficiency 
of their management and maintenance remains extremely poor. 
While sparsely populated areas near some military bases are 
impeding normal education for children of GSDF members assigned 
to the bases and hampering GSDF members from finding jobs after 
separation, residents in urban areas are increasingly demanding 
the closure of military bases. 
  The GSO believes it is indispensable to shut down or 
integrate some military bases to resolve those problems. The GSO 
has already unveiled plans to close small military bases and to 
merge them into medium-sized military bases to be manned by more 
then 1,500 men in line with the principle of locating one 
military base in one prefecture while maintaining readiness for 
emergencies. 
  Of 38 military bases in Hokkaido under command of the 
Northern Army to prepare for the "threat from the North," 26 
bases in Wakanai, Nayoru, Shimabe and Rebun will remain intact, 
but 12 bases in Kushiro, Kuchian, and Kitageidei will be either 
closed or merged into other bases in light of the need to cope 
with emergencies. 
  At the time of the founding the SDF in 1954, GSDF military 
bases numbered 102, but they have since continued to increase 
during the 1960s and the 1970s because of administrative needs 
to cope with sparsely populated areas and to send SDF members to 
disaster-hit areas. The GSO's plans to close or integrate the 
GSDF military bases are expected to draw a backlash from local 
governments, which have vigorously lobbied to induce military 
bases, and from legislators from constituencies where military 
bases subject to closing and integration are located.

  [Text] A third party organ will be established in the 
Prime Minister's Office to implement political reform, including 
the easing of government regulations. In this regard, on 28 
December, the government decided to make it a strong organ. In 
addition to deliberation and investigation rights, the 
government decided to allow the organ to have its own 
secretariat and to give advice to ministers. It is a concept 
designed to make the organ similar, in terms of its form and 
power, to the National Railway Reconstruction Administration 
Council, which was charged with overseeing the privatization of 
the national railway system. The government plans to submit 
legislation establishing the body to the next ordinary Diet 
session, pending consultations with coalition parties. 
  The concept of establishing the third party organ was formed 
in response to a report by the Economic Reform Study Council -- 
a private consultative body to Prime Minister Hosokawa -- and 
recommendations by the Provisional Council for Promotion of 
Administrative Reform (third administrative reform council). 
The new body's main tasks will be: 1) to discuss the five-year 
deregulation program to be created by the administrative reform 
promotion headquarters to be established as early as mid-January 
and to watch how it will be carried out; and 2) to work out the 
draft of the freedom-of-information legislation on the basis of 
government inquiries. If necessary, the body will be authorized 
to intervene in discussions on the creation of deregulation 
programs by individual ministries and agencies and watch the 
progress of program implementation and advise cabinet ministers. 
  For the time being, it is likely that an influential person 
in the financial world will be appointed to head the body. 
  Moreover, the government is studying the possibility of 
appointing academicians, private citizens, retired bureaucrats, 
and journalists to the body. In particular, the government 
intends to allow the Diet to appoint council members. 
  The idea of allowing the organ to have its own secretariat 
stems from an Economic Reform Council proposal made in its final 
report, saying that the organ should "have its own secretariat." 
It seems that the secretariat will be staffed by officials from 
the Management and Coordination Agency [MCA] and other 
ministries and agencies. 
  Regarding the third party organ, Prime Minister Hosokawa and 
MCA Director General Koshiro Ishida agreed on the basis of the 
National Administrative Organization Act's Clause 8 to establish 
the body in the Prime Minister's Office. Following the 
agreement, coordination was made within the government. As a 
result, the concept of forming the third party organ was formed. 
  The government intends to make the organ similar to the 
National Railway Reconstruction Administration Council, which 
was also formed on the basis of Clause 8 and had its own 
secretariat and right to advise ministers. It will be a 
stronger body than the Provisional Council for Promotion of 
Administrative Reform, which did not have the right to advise 
ministers. 
  However, some members of the coalition parties, such as 
members of Naoto Kan's system revision study group which is 
composed of supra-partisan faction members, want the proposed 
body to report directly to the Diet to ensure that the 
organization is completely independent of the government. 
Because of this, coordination within the government and the 
ruling parties for the body's formation may be rough sailing.

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's "political 
reform" line, which the international society welcomed when he 
formed his administration, has recently started to become an 
obstacle to Japan's diplomatic activities. Due to a conflict 
between the ruling and opposition parties over political reform, 
Prime Minister Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata were forced to 
cancel planned trips; Hosokawa was scheduled to visit Britain in 
January and Hata was planning to make a round of calls to the 
Middle East and Europe. In particular, relations between Japan 
and the United States are in a serious condition. Some people 
doubt that the prime minister will be able to announce at 
Japan-U.S. summit talks, slated for February, effective 
pump-priming economic measures in line with Japan's pledge to 
the United States to reduce Japan's trade surplus. It is 
pointed out that, if not properly handled, the relations between 
the two countries "may become worse than before," (according to 
a senior Foreign Ministry official). 
  The New York summit held in September, where Prime Minister 
Hosokawa and President Clinton met with each other for the first 
time, was a venue for the "reformist leaders" to confirm their 
solidarity. Expecting that the prime minister might launch 
policies beneficial to the United States, the United States so 
far has maintained a stance of watching the "administration for 
political reform" in a relatively warm manner. 
  It can be said that the next summit will be their first 
actual chance to mutually examine progress of the new Japan-U.S. 
economic talks. The Japanese Government plans to reject U.S. 
demands to set numerical targets in individual fields. However, 
the government understands that it is macroeconomically 
necessary to show some degree of a positive stance toward U.S. 
demands for expansion of Japan's domestic demands and to reduce 
the trade surplus. 
  However, the Hosokawa administration had no choice but to 
give up compilation of the 1994 budget, which was much desired 
for stimulating the economy, before the end of 1993 and to delay 
making a decision on income tax reduction until the next year 
[1994]. Moreover, mid-January of next year -- when the 
government plans to launch economic measures -- is indeed the 
time when deliberation on political reform will reach its final 
stage. We can make no guess about whether or not the government 
will be able to sufficiently deal with the political situation 
when it gets confused. This is why the United States, which so 
far has ventured to pretend as if it were in a "Japan-U.S. 
honeymoon period," feels uneasy about Japan's political 
situation. 
  On the other hand, due to the substantial extension of the 
current Diet session, it became impossible for the prime 
minister to make his planned round of calls to Italy, Germany, 
and France. The foreign minister also had to call off a series 
of planned trips abroad. Various diplomatic obstacles are being 
felt now. But, it is obvious that the Hosokawa administration 
will immediately fall into a crisis of administrative collapse 
should it fail to deal with top priority issues needed for 
political reform. Feeling such a dilemma, a senior Foreign 
Ministry official said in a self-scorning tone that "the Tokyo 
summit was held after the Diet was dissolved."

  [Text] As a result of investigations conducted by MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN, it was learned on 4 January that technical officials 
retiring from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MPT] 
to join private construction firms formed an OB [old boys] 
association called "Yukenkai," and companies employing members 
of this group had a monopoly over major construction projects, 
such as the construction of post office buildings. Companies 
employing ex-MPT officials received public work orders from the 
MPT amounting to nearly 90 billion yen in fiscal 1992 alone. It 
was also learned that members of the Yukenkai petitioned with 
incumbent MPT bureaucrats to win bids, and they also helped in 
compiling lists of supporters for Diet members who were formerly 
from the MPT. This is another indication of the long 
established collusion among "politicians, bureaucrats, and 
businesses." 
  The Yukenkai is said to have been organized in the second 
half of the 1950's, and its membership had remained a secret. 
MAINICHI has been able to uncover membership details for the 
first time after obtaining an internal document. Only 
"individuals who have worked with the MPT, and who are presently 
employed by construction firms" were qualified to join the 
group, and membership had to be approved by a general meeting of 
the association after an applicant personally expressed an 
intention to join. The membership fee was 4,000 yen a year, and 
the total number of members was over 100. 
  One ex-MPT official had even joined the Yukenkai while he 
was 
still an employee of a life insurance company, prior to his 
eventual transfer to a construction firm two years later. There 
is a rule that bureaucrats cannot join a company related to his 
area of jurisdiction within two years after retirement. 
Apparently, he was nominally affiliated to another company for 
the duration. 
  Companies employing ex-MPT officials did not include the big 
four general contractors (Kajima, Taisei, Shimizu, and 
Obayashi-Gumi), but consisted of around 70 second-tier, 
middle-ranking, and local construction companies, such as 
Sumitomo Construction Company, Fujita Corporation, and Muramoto 
Construction, which virtually went bankrupt in November 1993. 
  The chairman of Yukenkai was traditionally a former head of 
the MPT's Building Department, who is the top technical official 
in the ministry. 
  According to a list of orders placed by MPT or local post 
offices for projects to construct or renovate post office 
buildings and other government offices, companies employing 
ex-MPT officials were given almost all the orders, except for 
small-scale local projects. These projects cost around 70 
billion yen each for fiscal 1991 and 1992. 
  Furthermore, nine out of the 10 companies participating in 
the JV (joint venture) to build the Osaka Parcel Post Office, an 
ongoing large-scale project extending over several fiscal years, 
are construction firms employing ex-MPT officials. Adding the 
appropriations for this Osaka project, the annual cost of orders 
placed would be around 90 billion yen each for the two fiscal 
years. Since the MPT's total annual budget for construction 
projects is estimated to be just over 100 billion yen, employers 
of Yukenkai members took up the lion's share. 
  A managing director of Kochi-Gumi, who used to be a Yukenkai 
member, says, "as part of marketing operations, there were 
instances where we would request incumbent MPT senior officials 
to include our company in the bid winners," admitting the 
existence of close links with incumbent bureaucrats. 
  A vice president of Tokyu Construction Company, also an 
ex-Yukenkai member, reports that he was once directly asked by 
an incumbent MPT senior official to make arrangements to acquire 
land to locate a post office building, and land was subsequently 
bought from a company affiliated with Tokyu, with Tokyu 
pocketing the construction contract. This vice president also 
testifies that "when I was Yukenkai chairman, we were asked by 
Diet members who were formerly MPT officials to compile their 
lists of supporters." This shows that ex-MPT officials were also 
involved in elections. 
  As our investigation of the Yukenkai was in progress last 
October, the group was suddenly disbanded. The only explanation 
given by Choichiro Kurokawa, then chairman, was: "It was my 
personal decision to disband the association." 
  On the other hand, Isao Ojima, head of the MPT Construction 
Department, says, "Requests for inclusion in bids come from 
former ministry officials as part of regular marketing 
activities. However, I believe there has been no "dango" [bid 
rigging] in the bidding process. Moreover, it is quite 
impossible that the MPT would have asked its former officials to 
arrange for land purchases."

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] To prepare for the "second phase" of political 
realignment, Sakigake [Harbinger] has increased its activities. 
While secretly approaching the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
members who are expected to leave the LDP, it is hastily making 
efforts to improve circumstances for a merger with the Japan New 
Party [JNP]. Sakigake has been spurred to activity by such 
factors as its sense of crisis about Shinseito's attempt to 
strengthen its power within the ruling coalition by luring JNP 
members, and about the fact that Shinseito and Komeito have 
taken initiatives in policymaking within the ruling coalition on 
such issues as how to handle political reform bills in the Diet. 
  Thinking that House of Representatives elections will be 
held 
following the passage of the political reform bills, Sakigake 
has drawn up a political realignment scenario under which the 
party will: 1) hasten a merger with the JNP, a pending issue 
between the two parties; 2) call on the LDP members who advocate 
electoral reform to join Sakigake; and 3) join hands at the 
final stage with some of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] members to 
establish a new party with a membership of about 100. 
  In mid-November, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa (also JNP 
representative) "urged" Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet 
secretary and Sakigake representative, to realize a merger 
between the two parties. However, Takemura said "there are 
different views (within the JNP)." As stated by Takemura, there 
are two groups in the JNP, one which supports the merger with 
Sakigake and the other which takes a negative stance on the 
merger. Sakigake plans to do its utmost to obtain consent from 
the latter group to the merger. 
  Sakigake believes that about 30 LDP members are prepared to 
leave he LDP. Of them, Sakigake has frequently made contacts 
with 20 or so LDP members close to them, including a group led 
by Masayasu Kitagawa, telling them that "we would like to form a 
political group composed of those who take the same political 
stance" while watching carefully the developments of the 
electoral reform debate. 
  Sakigake also gropes for measures to form an alliance with 
"Democrats," a new political group composed of right-wing and 
neutral factions of the SDPJ. Moreover, it has frequently held 
study meetings with "Group C&amp;C," a political group within the 
DSP composed of former labor union members. 
  Sakigake aims to achieve a "moderate multiparty" political 
system, taking a different stance from Shinseito Chief Secretary 
Ichiro Ozawa and others who propose a "two-party system." Based 
on this stand, Sakigake will prepare for the second phase of 
political realignment. On joining hands with DSP members, a 
senior Sakigake official said: "We will contact only those who 
do not belong to a group led by DSP Secretary General Takashi 
Yonezawa, who is close to Ozawa." 
  With the participation by independent lower house member 
Koichiro Genba, Sakigake has become the third largest force in 
the ruling coalition, placing the DSP behind it. Genba was 
initially expected to join Shinseito. It is likely that 
friction between Sakigake and Shinseito and between Sakigake and 
some DSP groups will inevitably intensify in the future.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article; part 29 in the series "The Coalition </F>
-- A Revolving Stage"; "A Bitter Year End and Beginning of New 
Year for the Prime Minister; Endurance Required as Cohesive 
Power Seems To Fade; Crucial Stage Where Leadership Is Put To 
Test"] 
  [Text] "We would like to work hard next year toward making 
politics more transparent by solving our accumulated problems 
quickly." These were the words spoken by Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa at an informal gathering held at the Prime 
Minister's Official Residence on the afternoon of 28 December, 
the closing day of official business, as he reflected deeply on 
the past five months since the establishment of the coalition 
government. 
<H5>  Successive Late Night Decisions </H5>
  Nevertheless, during that particular week in mid-December, 
there occurred a succession of "late night dramas" that 
symbolized the coalition government's suddenly facing a crisis, 
as the favorable winds which supported the prime minister lost 
the power they once had. 
  The coalition government hoped to make a decision on partial 
opening of the rice market on 13 December. The prime minister 
remained in his office from that evening, anxiously waiting for 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to make its decision 
on the rice issue. He ate a mouthful of donuts his eldest 
daughter brought him. From the open windows, he could hear the 
shouting of demonstrators protesting partial opening of the rice 
market. 
  It was nearly 0200 hours the next day when the SDPJ finally 
arrived at a decision, saying that it "is opposed to partial 
rice market opening, but understands the prime minister's 
decision." The prime minister then began his news conference at 
0400 hours. 
  Two days later, a decision to extend the current Diet 
session 
for 45 days to have political reform bills enacted during the 
current session was finally made at the lower house plenary 
session a little after 2300 hours. However, the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] boycotted the session. Consequently, the 
outlook on the fate of the political reform bills became more 
uncertain. 
  Finally, 17 December arrived. This time, it took until the 
very late hours of the night to decide on whether to work on 
drafting the budget for the next fiscal year by the year-end or 
carry over the work to next year. Prime Minister Hosokawa was 
busy in his office, calling senior officials of coalition 
parties to coordinate opinions. That night, the prime minister 
revealed his feelings through his facial expressions -- 
something unusual for him -- as he replied to a correspondent's 
question, saying: "The ruling coalition parties are ever so 
divided over this issue." 
  Political reform, the rice issue, action that needs to be 
taken against serious and unprecedented economic deterioration, 
and tax reforms including consumption tax hikes -- in 
considering the significance of each of these tasks, it is 
natural that the prime minister is having difficulties. Even 
since the days when the LDP was in power, it has been considered 
that trying to solve any one of these tasks would "require 
determination on the part of the prime minister with a readiness 
to sacrifice the cabinet" (as stated by a close aide to the 
prime minister). 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa himself had that kind of 
determination. On 20 November, leaders of various nations 
participating in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
meeting in Seattle, Washington successively congratulated 
Hosokawa, saying: "Congratulations on the success of your 
political reform efforts." The prime minister replied: "No, no. 
It will be much more difficult with the upper house of the 
Diet." Thus, it was Hosokawa himself who actually made what 
seemed to be an overly cautious remark. 
  However, it is questionable whether he could have predicted 
that deliberations at the upper house on the political reform 
bills were yet to start one month thereafter. Meanwhile, as 
political reform remained stalled, other pending issues began to 
pile up. 
  "Endurance is the only way." Recently, the prime minister 
has often spoken these words at the Prime Minister's Office and 
at his official residence. Since he is well aware of attacks 
from the LDP and moves by dissident SDPJ members, the term 
"endurance" probably applies to the fact that his power to keep 
the coalition government together seems to have begun fading 
away. 
  "The Prime Minister's Office has not been doing its job 
properly." These were words spoken by an angry Ichiro Ozawa, 
secretary general of the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], on the 
night before a decision was made on carrying over the work on 
drafting the fiscal year 1994 budget to next year. Seeing Ozawa 
in such anger, Hosokawa was unable to even bring up discussion 
to seek his advice on the all-important budget issue. Ozawa's 
complaints were primarily aimed at Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura, who tried to make various decisions while 
frequently consulting with senior LDP officials. Ever since the 
inauguration of the coalition government, the split between 
Ozawa and Takemura, rather than narrowing, has come to the verge 
of shaking the very foundations of the coalition government. 
<H3>  Bureaucrats Start Shying Away From Supporting Coalition 
Government </H3>
  Seeing the coalition government wavering, it seems that 
bureaucrats, too, are beginning to shy away from supporting it. 
Recently, Prime Minister Hosokawa has taken the most pains with 
working out policy adjustments with the Ministry of Finance 
concerning tax cuts which will serve as the pillars of 
anticyclical measures. The following dialogue between Hosokawa 
and Jiro Saito, administrative vice-minister of finance, 
illustrates this situation. 
  Hosokawa: "Since keeping tax cuts and consumption tax hikes 
as a single package has a negative effect on economic recovery, 
can it be arranged so that the two can be treated separately?" 
  Saito: "Such a request is unacceptable." 
  The Finance Ministry refuses to concede, insisting that 
"fiscal matters have priority." For example, it has asserted: 
"Previous prime ministers have all followed our plans." 
  The leaders of various coalition parties and bureaucrats who 
are expected to support the prime minister in the coalition 
government are fighting among each other, as they all have their 
own opinions and stances that they must uphold. For a certain 
length of time following the inauguration of the coalition 
government, things seemed to proceed smoothly somehow with 
favorable winds blowing. Suddenly, however, a situation has 
emerged where the prime minister must exercise leadership to get 
things moving. 
<H5>  Giving Up on Skiing and Hot Spring Baths </H5>
  Indecision on the part of the prime minister would directly 
lead to his being bombarded by criticism that he "lacks 
leadership" or is pursuing a "wait-and-see politics." At the 21 
December meeting of the Expanded Policy Committee of the 
Sakigake [Harbinger]-Japan New Party [JNP] parliamentary group, 
even members of the prime minister's own party successively 
complained that "the Prime Minister's Office has failed to 
exercise leadership." 
  Hosokawa spent New Year holidays in 1993 at his villa in 
Karuizawa, Nagano Prefecture quietly working out his plans on 
the lower house general election and on removing the LDP from 
power. 
  It was a bewildering year for Hosokawa. The plan to oust the 
LDP from power succeeded, and Hosokawa himself became prime 
minister. Then passed the brilliant period when the new 
coalition government firmly stood up, advocating "reform." As 
soon as the New Year holidays are over, Hosokawa will 
immediately face a truly crucial moment when the existence of 
the coalition government will be at stake. 
  The prime minister will be spending most of his time during 
the end of the year and the New Year holidays at his official 
residence, giving up on skiing and resting at hot springs -- the 
way he originally hoped to spend the holidays -- because "there 
are so many things that must be taken care of."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Prime Minister Should Fulfill Leadership To </F>
Indicate Economic Vision"] 
  [Text] The public has begun to be critical of the Hosokawa 
administration because it has become difficult for political 
reform-related bills, which are the administration's only claim 
to fame, to be enacted and because the administration has failed 
to show fresh blood in economic pump-priming measures with the 
new year approaching. At a 24 December news conference, Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa apologized to the public for his 
failure to enact the political reform bills before the end of 
the year. Meanwhile, he failed to make clear-cut remarks on 
economic measures and did not indicate a concrete vision for the 
economy. 
  Most of the people understand that political reform and 
economic measures are difficult issues which the Liberal 
Democratic Party has left unsolved and the new coalition 
administration cannot easily solve. Nevertheless, Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's recent remarks were unclear and not as frank 
as those made when he was inaugurated as prime minister. 
  If the prime minister cannot speak in his "own" words, the 
public support rate for his administration will continue to 
drop. Amid the economic recession, this is a chilly situation. 
  At the news conference, the prime minister first mentioned 
economic pump-priming measures. Most of the people must have 
strained their ears when the prime minister was explaining six 
economic measures after stating that he "was seriously concerned 
about the current economic situation." However, he did not 
refer to income tax reduction -- which is considered to be the 
most important issue at this point -- until the last of the six 
measures. Moreover, the prime minister did not indicate a 
concrete scale or timing for implementing income tax cuts. 
  As the first five measures, the prime minister cited the 
following: promoting deregulation in areas that will produce 
immediate results; compiling a third supplementary budget for 
the current fiscal year in consideration of improvement of 
living conditions as well as promotion of research and 
development activities; helping those concerned with agriculture 
or small industries; implementing a total employment assistance 
program; and devising measures that will increase the liquidity 
of land. All of these are nothing new. Moreover, a package of 
those economic measures will have no great impact on the current 
economy. We cannot help wondering whether the prime minister 
has recognized the current situation of the worst post-war 
recession in which the supply-and-demand gap has reached 30 
trillion yen. 
  It has been said that the prime minister is considering a 
plan to reduce income tax by more than 6 trillion yen. However, 
at the news conference, the prime minister showed a cautious 
stance, stating that income tax cuts will be decided "in 
consideration of Tax Commission recommendations and the Hiraiwa 
[chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan, 
Keidanren] Economic Reform Council report," and that "the 
decision should not be made hastily and the decision will be 
made by the time the fiscal 1994 budget is compiled." 
  The prime minister's remarks made after fall seem to reflect 
the complicated management of the coalition of seven parties and 
one parliamentary group. It seems that in the field of economic 
policies, the prime minister has been strongly influenced by the 
Finance Ministry, which places importance on financial balance. 
It is regrettable that the prime minister's lilting actions 
have begun to make a poor show. 
  What we strongly hope for the prime minister is to 
positively 
fulfill the leadership from his position as the highest 
politician. We hope the prime minister will play a more positive 
role in coordinating opinions within the coalition 
administration. When the leader serves as Kuroko [a Kabuki 
stagehand dressed in black to be inconspicuous, who assists 
actors in various ways during the performance], it is impossible 
to consolidate the unity of the coalition administration. Under 
the current circumstances, it is unforgivable to delay carrying 
out political reform. 
  The serious, prolonged economic recession remains at the 
bottom. All possible measures should be taken to pull the 
sluggish economy from the bottom. The prime minister said: "We 
cannot choose the easy way of issuing deficit-covering national 
bonds." If that is the case, the prime minister should clarify 
what measures can be taken to secure revenue sources for 
implementing income tax cuts. 
  While the prime minister is considering ideas of "making 
1994 
the first year for promoting deregulation" or of "setting up an 
economic measures council for dealing with revenue sources for 
tax cuts," actual business activities are being conducted to 
seek the way out of the recession. As a matter of course, the 
political vacuum is unforgivable. We would like the prime 
minister, in his capacity as the top politician, to clearly 
indicate his own scenario for carrying out political reform and 
revitalizing the economy.

  [Text] The Finance Ministry [MOF], which operates the 
national automatic customs clearance system [NACCS] which 
processes customs clearance with the help of computers, has 
decided to make available the NACCS' information to exporters 
and importers. With the NACCS being made open to exporters and 
importers, trading firms including exporters and importers will 
be able to obtain information on their import-export dealings 
and simplify procedures for paying tariffs. The Finance 
Ministry has decided to make the NACCS accessible to exporters 
and importers in response to requests from the business 
community, including the Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations]. Once the question of meeting the cost of 
changing the system which the business community has requested 
is settled, the NACCS will be opened in early 1995. 
  The NACCS, which is designed primarily to speedily process 
customs clearance on exported and imported cargo, was first used 
with air cargo in 1978 and then with sea cargo in 1991. The 
NACCS processes all information about the origin and destination 
of cargo, the permits for customs clearance, and the payment of 
tariffs. 
  Currently only customs houses, customs clearance companies, 
and banks have access to the NACCS. Major trading firms are 
using the "comprehensive deferred payment procedure" which 
allows them to make a monthly payment of tariffs, but they can 
obtain information on the amount of tariffs only through customs 
clearance companies. This has complicated the procedure for 
calculating tariff payments. 
  Information provided by the NACCS is said to be of great use 
to trading firms for managing their overall export and import 
dealings. For this reason, the business community has asked the 
Finance Ministry to expand access to the NACCS through the 
Keidanren. 
  In response, the government decided to provide exporters and 
importers with part of the NACCS-held information on the payment 
of tariffs in a deregulation package it announced in September. 
The latest decision by the Finance Ministry will make it 
possible for exporters and importers to gain access to all of 
the NACCS information about them through their on-line terminals 
or other means. 
  In the future, the government and the private sector will 
jointly promote responses to the requests of information users 
and ways to meet those requests. Attention will focus on to 
what degree private enterprises can bear the cost of altering 
the NACCS.

  [Text] In order to boost the actual growth rate to 2 
percent in fiscal 1994, economic ministries and agencies, 
including the Finance Ministry, decided to launch measures 
designed: 1) to reduce income taxes by over six trillion yen -- 
the income tax cuts will be made through fiscal 1994, and the 
tax revisions will take effect in January 1994; 2) to reduce the 
consumption tax for automobile purchases from the current 4.5 
percent to 3 percent; and 3) to inject an additional 5 trillion 
yen into public works projects through the third fiscal 1993 
supplementary budget and fiscal 1994 government budget, money 
which will be executed by both national and local governments. 
At the same time, they also decided to announce measures to 
deal with the non-performing loans of financial institutions. 
These measures will be included in the comprehensive economic 
measures the government will prepare in mid-January. The 
ministries and agencies say the measures will be announced on 
the premise that income tax reductions as well as increases in 
the consumption tax to about 7 percent in April 1995 should be 
made simultaneously. However, they also say a plan to delay 
consumption tax increases -- in case it disrupts the economic 
recovery -- should be clearly spelled out in relevant bills for 
tax reform. A special feature of the measures is that 
considerations are given to the economic situation. Financial 
authorities plan to persuade the ruling coalition parties and 
economic circles about these measures. However, it seems Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will face difficulty in coordinating 
the ruling coalition parties because some of them, including the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan, are strongly against the idea 
of increasing the consumption tax rate. 
  Other stimulus measures the ministries and agencies are 
planing to incorporate in the bills are "increases in the amount 
the Housing Loan Corporation will allow consumers to borrow for 
home purchases as well as tax decreases for house renovation 
expenses"; "purchases of land on which mortgages have been set 
by banks prior to drawing actual plans for large scale public 
land utilization and to relaxing land taxes"; "abolishing the 
special corporate tax as early as 1994, which was introduced 
during the Gulf war"; and "lifting the ban on corporate 
purchases of their own company stocks." The ministries and 
agencies are also trying to work out specific measures regarding 
the nonperforming loans of financial institutions. 
  At the same time, they will launch medium- and long-term 
measures designed to speed up the timing of public works; they 
will also spend large portions of the 430 trillion yen earmarked 
in the current fundamental plan for public investments for the 
ten-year period ending in 2000. Moreover, they are planning to 
show a blueprint of the economic situation for the beginning of 
the 21st century -- including the easing of government 
regulations as well as the reform of the industrial structure 
and the employment situation -- pending coordination among 
government agencies and ministries. 
  As a result of an expansion in income tax reductions and 
public investments which are part of the current economic 
measures, the government will boost the actual economic growth 
rate by 2 percent or more over the next 15 months. Because of 
this, the government will aim at making the growth rate, which 
is expected to be almost 0 percent in fiscal 1993, recover to 2 
percent in fiscal 1994 and to 3 percent after fiscal 1995, a 
steady growth route. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is 
scheduled to announce such fundamental ideas at a news 
conference on New Year's day. 
  These economic measures are being worked out on the premise 
that the general consumption tax will be raised starting April 
1995. The consumption rate for cars, for instance, will be 
temporarily dropped from 4.5 percent to 3 percent in April 1994, 
but that is to induce people to buy new cars before the tax rate 
is raised. The consumption tax increase is a precondition to 
abolition of the special 2.5 percent corporate tax introduced to 
raise revenues for the Gulf war. As a source of revenue to make 
up for the shortfalls which will be created by income tax 
reductions, the government plans to issue "emergency bonds" 
until it can raise the consumption tax. 
  Moreover, the government stresses that if it fails to 
achieve 
its plan to increase the consumption tax, the plan to expand 
public investment will be linked to the issuance of more 
construction bonds, which will worsen financial situation and 
will hamper activation of the Japanese economy in terms of the 
medium- and long-term perspective. Because of this, economic 
ministries and agencies, including the Finance Ministry, are 
assuming the stance that they cannot help but change the 
economic measures if they are not be able to increase the 
consumption tax after 15 months.

  [Text] Import cars are not gaining strength only because of 
the strong yen. An offensive, which has included restructuring, 
sales channel reorganization, the introduction of new cars, 
etc., is beginning to bear fruit. 
  The full-fledged offensive of import cars has begun. The 
domestic new car market between January and August dropped off 
8.3 percent compared to the same period of the previous year. 
However, imported cars have increased by as much as 12.4 percent. 
  The biggest reason for this significant growth is the import 
of cars produced abroad by domestic manufacturers or, put 
another way, the increase of reverse import cars. According to 
results from January through August, these have expanded by 
27,826 units--more than double the amount compared to the same 
term of the previous year. Contributing to this is the start of 
imports of models such as Toyota's Scepter wagon, Honda's Civic 
coupe, Mitsubishi's Diamante wagon, etc., that had not been 
imported into Japan before. 
  However, imports of the so-called gaisha [foreign cars] 
(true 
imports), which exclude the reverse importation cars, are also 
steadily increasing. According to the results from January to 
August, these have increased by 0.2 percent compared to the same 
term of the previous year, reaching 104,593 units. 
  Contributing to this is the fact that, since about last 
year, 
several true import carmakers have begun to put some strenuous 
efforts in capturing the Japanese market. Behind that is the 
fact that Yanase abandoned import sales of Volkswagens at the 
end of last year, and beginning this year tried selling the Opal. 
  Volkswagen Audi Nippon (VAN), in the middle of 1990 tried to 
construct a sales system of 100,000 units per year, but 
opposition was generated between it and Yanase, who wanted to 
sell Volkswagen as a rare luxury car, and in the end, Yanase 
quit selling VW's. This move could be described as symbolic in 
Japan's import car market. Foreign automobile makers are no 
longer trying to sell cars in Japan as though foreign cars are 
equivalent to luxury cars but are trying to sell many cars while 
standing on the same playing field as the domestic makers. 
  Says Rover Japan President Peter J. Woods, "When I found out 
that Yanase was going to abandon sales of VW, I thought that 
Japan's import car market map would change significantly. I 
immediately reported to my home country (England) and drew up 
various countermeasure strategies on the aspects of product and 
price." 
  On the price front, it implemented a "fair play policy" in 
February of this year which is what it calls restoration of 
profits due to the strong yen difference. It lowered vehicle 
prices targeting three models, such as the "Rover Mini series" 
on the weighted average of 13 percent. It has successively 
introduced a total of seven new models such as the automatic 
Discovery, the Rover 200/400 series, among others. At the end of 
1992, its sales bases were transformed to become 100 percent 
dedicated sales. Forbidding parallel sales with other cars like 
Peugeot and Renault, it aimed to strengthen sales capacity at 
each base. By the combination of these effects it has recorded a 
35.5-percent increase over the 8,793 units of the same term of 
the previous year in its results from January through August. 
  In the future as well, "We plan to introduce new models 
during the period from 1994 to the beginning of 1995. Since the 
`fair play policy' was considered with a five- to six-year 
interim period, I believe that people will feel that models 
introduced in the future will be quite inexpensive," says Mr. 
Woods. Further, beginning in November, the Discovery RV will 
begin to be sold at Honda Motor dealerships under the name of 
Crossroad. It is cooperation that would not be possible without 
Honda Motor, which is investing 20 percent in Rover itself. 
  Until now the strength of the Germans with VW, Mercedes 
Benz, 
and BMW has been overwhelming in Japan's import car market. In 
1992, they held 60 percent of the import car market. However, 
going into 1993, the share of the German side dropped to 48 
percent. As mentioned above, VW lost its major dealership of 
Yanase, and in January to August suffered a reduction of 41.5 
percent compared to the same term of the previous year. Further, 
due to the domestic sales slump, sales of the luxury cars 
Mercedes and BMW dropped 9.1 percent and 11.1 percent, 
respectively. 
  U.S. Cars Also Finally Make Serious Bid 
  By contrast, the ones winning a significant increase in 
share 
are those on the U.S. side. Honda USA, Toyota, Chrysler, and 
Ford are improving. Whereas their share had been only 18 percent 
in 1992, it has reached 30 percent in 1993. 
  Of the foreign-owned makers, Chrysler had a dramatic 
3.2-fold 
increase compared to the same term of the previous year. That 
company's recovery in the United States is also remarkable and 
it has clearly become stronger in the Japanese market as well. 
Its import sales arm, Chrysler Japan Sales, which should be able 
to turn its balance sheet from continuously red to black ink by 
1996, began to embark on various measures last year. 
  First, the company's structure was rationalized. Its 
employees, which numbered 107 in April 1992, were reduced to 30, 
less than one-third, by September 1993. Then it quit investing 
in directly managed dealers, directly managed plants and PDI 
(predelivery improvement) centers. It had Seibu Automotive Sales 
take on all the directly managed dealerships, of which there 
were 48, and at the same time, by increasing the amount handled 
by Honda Motor, the number of sales bases was increased from 
1,000 at the beginning of 1992 to just over 1,800. Furthermore, 
100 percent of PDI, which was being performed at three 
locations, was concentrated at the Honda Motor Co. Tochigi plant. 
  It is performing strategic pricing and the introduction of 
new models very enthusiastically. The Jeep Cherokee, which it 
had been selling at 5.35 million yen until last year, was 
reduced in January 1993 to 3.72 million yen--a discount of as 
much as 1.62 million yen. "Until 1992, U.S.-specification cars 
had been brought over and headlights, turn signals, fenders, 
emissions sensors, etc., were being replaced. Starting with 1993 
models, it began mass production of cars for export with 
English, Australian, and Japanese specifications which had 
steering wheels on the right-hand side, so about all that was 
necessary to do in Japan was to put on the Japanese seals," 
according to Osamu Nagata, business planning department manager 
at Chrysler Japan Sales. It was possible to achieve a large cost 
reduction by changing the complex manual operations that were 
being done in Japan to mass production at its U.S. plant. 
  Moreover, he says, "We want to reduce the difference in 
price 
between domestic and foreign products. We want to compete at a 
price that compares favorable even with other domestically 
produced RV's," indicating a that there was also a strategic 
motive. And then, this price was determined "at the end of 1992, 
calculated at 110 yen to the dollar," says Mr. Nakata. 
  In addition to this, the fact that three types of the new 
models of Grand Cherokee were introduced beginning in January 
has also led to increased sales. Also in the future, says Mr. 
Nagata, "we will soon begin sales of the 3.5 liter displacement 
Vision (commonly called the LH)." Further, it is thought that in 
the United States the low-priced compact car Neon dubbed the 
Japanese car killer will be introduced in 1995. 
  Ford's move to increase its strength in Japan is also 
vigorous. It is showing a 53.9-percent rise in the period from 
January to August. Contributing to this is the elevation of its 
power by expanding its personnel at Ford Japan which is in 
charge of import sales. In the year and a half since the 
beginning of last year, it added between 70 and 80 employees so 
that now there are about 110. And, says Ford Japan Advertising 
Liaison Headquarters Manager Hiroaki Tanabe, "We have taken a 
policy since 1991 of gradually bringing costs and follow-up 
service to be on a par with domestically produced cars." Prices 
are revised in autumn of each year and it is common for them to 
rise, but Ford has lowered prices in both 1991 and 1992. The 3.8 
liter Taurus wagon, which was 4.15 million yen in 1990, was 
reduced to 3.986 million yen in 1991 and 3.78 million yen in 
1992. 
  Furthermore, since dealers had been conducting direct import 
sales, the Explorer RV that had been selling at 5.25 million yen 
was switched to Ford Japan importation, and the price was 
reduced by 1.26 million yen to 3.99 million yen. 
  Also, in April 1993, it built a parts depot (parts center). 
Until now, most parts had to be gotten from the United States, 
but this has made it possible to execute more prompt follow-up 
service. 
  "In the first half of 1994, we are planning introduction of 
right-hand side steering wheels on the Probe, Mondeo, and the 
three Mustang models. Further we will introduce right-hand side 
steering wheels on the Taurus and the Explorer by 1997," says 
Mr. Tanabe. 
  The bulky GM is also beginning to stir. In its results from 
January to August, it was the only one among the Big Three to 
have a decrease, off by 12.4 percent. Much of this is due to a 
delay of four to five months more than expected in the receipt 
of the Chevrolet Camaro, which had undergone a full model 
change. Registration of the Camaro began in August, and has 
expanded greatly at a 46.8-percent increase over the same month 
of the previous year. 
  According to Michael Dougherty, president of Japan GM, "We 
will not launch a campaign of restoration of the profits from 
the high yen difference, but when one considers the future 
trends, there is no doubt that prices will end up dropping." It 
also plans to introduce a new Cadillac. 
  Moreover, concerning the Saturn, which has been a big hit in 
the United States, he says, "Currently, GM's Saturn project team 
has come over and is studying the Japanese market. We are 
examining the idea of establishing a Saturn channel for sales as 
was done in the United States. We want to introduce a right-hand 
drive car at about the same price as other domestically made 
cars in the mid-1990's." 
  The full-fledged offensive of the true import cars is 
building up steam with the passing of each day. As Japan GM 
President Dougherty points out, "It is inappropriate for the 
original import car share into Japan to be merely 4 percent," 
and, indeed, the share of import cars into Japan's market is 
extremely low compared to Europe and the United States. He adds, 
"It is exceedingly difficult to build a dealer network in Japan 
because of keiretsu, etc. 
  "Moreover, when introducing products, one had to go through 
the Ministry of Transport, which took time and effort, and we 
were not able to achieve good results. However, recently, with 
the beginning of development of a Saturn with a right-hand side 
steering wheel, among other things, GM itself is beginning to 
turn its attention toward the Japanese market," according to Mr. 
Dougherty. In Rover President Woods' view as well, "There are 
also trade imbalance problems, so there will probably be a 
growth of about 40 percent in true import cars in the next four 
years." 
  For the domestic market, growth of which is said to have 
ground to a halt, the threat of the import cars will prove to be 
a double punch. The struggle of Japanese cars will continue for 
quite some time.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Momoko Itoh: "Post-Bubble Business </F>
Strategies--Toyota Motors--Offensive of `Colossus' Indifferent 
to Appearances"] 
  [Text] Its operating rate has dropped with the stagnation 
in domestic sales and exports. It is tiding over surpluses in 
facilities and staffing by increasing sales and utilizing the 
group's strength; but in manifesting its latent power it is 
causing damage to other auto firms. 
  In late August at Toyota Motors headquarters in Toyoda City, 
Aichi Prefecture, the first "emergency" meeting in 35 years was 
held. It was an "emergency meeting of Toyota dealership 
association officers" bringing together some 100 major dealers. 
Regular meetings are held once every two months; but August is 
"summer vacation" so that the one after the June meeting usually 
is in September. Toyota Motors president Tatsuro Toyoda, stood 
to greet them and explained, "Its is because I would be uneasy 
if I did not see you all (dealers) for the three months until 
September." 
  What president Toyoda meant by uneasiness is the worsening 
of 
earnings, such that an operating deficit is even conceivable for 
the current December interim quarter. Also, the lower operating 
rate is such that a whole factory is said to be surplus. 
Director Shigeharu Tsuji, in charge of domestic operations, 
says: "Toyota has traditionally persevered while the 
manufacturer and dealers shared a common understanding and 
pursued a single goal. Even so, I think there are still things 
about the manufacturer that dealers find hard to understand. So, 
this time we had quite a detailed explanation from the top about 
Toyota's operating environment. This was the main purpose of the 
meeting." 
  As a result, the "operating environment explanation" tied 
into a call for increased sales; and it is not hard to imagine 
that there may be calls for price cutting. So, if the operating 
rate goes up, they can get by without raising employment issues, 
and the cooperating parts makers can be saved as well. 
<H5>  About To Demonstrate Latent Selling Power </H5>
  Toyota's worsened performance is caused by stagnation in 
domestic sales and the rapid rise of the yen. The June 1993 
quarter current-account earnings fell to 40 percent of their 
past peak in the 1990 June quarter; but now the focus of the 
problem is shifting to facilities and staff from merely worsened 
earnings. 
  Squeezing out facility surpluses properly is difficult; but 
as one criterion we will look at a comparison of the average 
monthly production of vehicles for the five big makers since 
1988, plus average monthly production for January through August 
this year. Except for Mitsubishi Motors, which had increased RV 
[recreational vehicle] production in recent years, we find a 
peak in 1990 and recent production holding at about 70-80 
percent of that. 
  For Toyota, its latest vehicle tally is at 86.4 percent of 
its peak. Furthermore, in late 1992 the plant of its Toyota 
Motors Kyushu subsidiary went into operation; this month the 
Iwate plant of the group's Kanto Auto Industries goes into 
operation; and late this year Toyota Auto Body's Inabe plant 
will be operational. 
  Yet, one must discount these facts just a bit. First, 
because 
during the peak period they were going all-out with overtime and 
work on holidays, the peak production level was somewhat 
"abnormal." Also, as Toyota Auto Body says, it is normal for 
"the new plants' share not to equate directly to facility 
increases because when the new plants go operational we will be 
doing things like idling facilities whose capacity increases 
were forced in the bubble era." Even taking such things into 
account, a Toyota leader admits to "the fact of a surplus at 
present." In August the plant's operation was cut by one day 
from the planned level by making the 16th a day off. Reduced 
production due to increased days off occurred for the first time 
since 1955. 
  The facility problem is sure to become paired with staffing 
problems. At Toyota, employment adjustments such as limiting new 
hires and short-term temporary duty for the production staff are 
already being seen. In August it was decided to cut in half the 
initially projected 1,000 April 1994 hires of production staff 
from among high school and technical school graduates. From the 
outset, college graduates to be hired were 400, down 40 percent 
from the previous year. Temporary workers, too, numbering 2,900 
in 1990--the peak year--are now approaching zero. Again, 175 
production cadres from such plants as Aichi and Motomachi have 
been sent off to Toyota Auto Body. Split into two teams, they 
will have the status of temporary-duty workers for three months 
each during September-December. 
  If such employment adjustments suffice, the burden imposed 
on 
employees will be comparatively small; but that assumes domestic 
production will not fall any further. To keep from being driven 
to using temporary layoffs and voluntary retirements, sustaining 
the plants' operating rates is essential. All they can do is 
expand sales; but autos are not an industry that can put out new 
products one after another based on bright ideas; and their 
appeal naturally starts with the price. 
  Toyota has a flock of such strong dealerships that it is 
called "Toyota of sales." Its 41.7 percent share of the domestic 
market (excluding light cars) already shows its strength fully; 
and yet in fact it still holds strength in reserve. For example, 
given its surplus funds, it could pass out sales incentive 
funds. Other carmakers always fear such latent power. And yet, 
the criticism is nervously made that so far the bigger Toyota 
has become "the more it seems to want everything for itself." As 
a result, it has avoided conditions such as would ultimately 
drive other firms to the wall. 
  Yet, now it comes down to Toyota itself being driven to the 
wall over "issues of facilities and personnel." The reality is 
that, to ensure a soft landing for itself, it cannot be 
concerned about the others. 
  And yet, Toyota's earnings now face an unprecedented crisis. 
If it pushes its sales expansion offensive too far, it will 
suffer losses. How far it goes with that depends on whether it 
can calculate improvements in the management environment for the 
medium range and whether it has methods to deal with that 
skillfully. 
<H5>  Walls Standing in Way at Home and Abroad </H5>
  If domestic production (domestic sales and exports) makes 
progress under current conditions even minimally and overseas 
production runs according to plan, Toyota can be an 
international firm preserving its high standing at home and 
abroad without making large employment adjustments or discarding 
facilities. Yet, in actuality, in domestic sales, exports, and 
production abroad there are differences of degree and barriers 
intervene. 
  First of all, there are no signs that domestic sales are 
recovering. While domestic registrations in September were down 
5 percent from the same month last year and have improved from 
the double-digit reduction at the middle of this year, many see 
this as largely the effect of model changes of such popular car 
types as the Skyline and Accord and not a change in the 
underlying tone. 
  Director Tsuji of Toyota says, "The present situation is one 
of a `reluctance to buy' deriving from such things as uneasiness 
over the future course of business. We derive hope from such 
things as the new government's economic policies and the Tokyo 
motor show opening this month. But our real sense is that we are 
in the dark about any clear-cut time for recovery." 
  Among analysts and others involved a common view is that in 
mid-1994 there will be an upturn in demand for cars along with 
economic recovery. This also depends on the economy, and the 
timing may slip; but there will certainly be replacement buying 
for that portion sold in a burst in the bubble era. So, one may 
foresee at least a surge in domestic demand in the mid-1990's. 
But, most forecasts do not see that happening to the extent of 
its level much surpassing that of 1990. 
  Now, as to exports, shipments to Europe and the United 
States, making up 65 percent of Japan's car exports, are 
severely affected by price increases responding to the high yen. 
Passenger car sales in the United States were up 8.1 percent in 
August compared to the same month last year; but those exported 
from Japan were down 2.1 percent. Japanese carmakers have set 
much larger price increases than the U.S. Big Three makers for 
the 1994 models being released this fall; and, along with the 
quality improvements in U.S. cars of late, this greatly lowers 
the competitiveness of Japanese cars. 
  In Europe, too, Japanese cars not only have weakened price 
competitiveness, but the outlook for car demand within the EC 
area is a drop of 16 percent. Due to this, in September the 
car-export monitoring framework for the EC in 1993--set in April 
at 1.085 million vehicles--was reduced to 980,000. Any recovery 
in demand next year also is moot. 
  Medium- and long-range exchange rates are generally expected 
to be anywhere from the present level to about 100 yen per 
dollar. Exports of Toyotas and other Japanese cars to Europe and 
the United States are gradually falling for two reasons: 
lessened competitiveness and expanded local production. At 
Toyota, they say, "We will strive to develop demand in places 
like Southeast Asia and China" so as to make up for this. Yet, 
current demand for autos in Asia is of only 34 million vehicles; 
and, except for a handful of countries like Thailand, the pace 
for market expansion is not at all clear. Whatever the 
long-range prospect, for the present it would be difficult for 
this alone to compensate for declining exports to Europe and the 
United States. 
<H5>  Trump Card Is Group Strength </H5>
  That being so, the scenario of domestic production 
stagnating 
even more in the near future is not unrealistic. That brings up 
the matter of surplus staffing. Normally, the ways to avoid 
personnel reductions are to sustain operating rates by expanding 
sales and to improve profits by raising prices, et cetera. Yet, 
at Toyota they also have an additional trump card: a "group 
strength" that is sturdier than that of the other companies. 
  As to price increases, Director Tsuji says, "Before that, 
cutting costs is important. Price increases are one way, too; 
but at a time when the market is sluggish the effect of that on 
sales is large." So, they still have one option left. 
  The Toyota group's solidarity is firm, causing a weakening 
of 
any sense of their using people excessively. At Toyota there is 
a whole group of companies that were formed shortly after the 
founding of the predecessor Toyota Auto Industries by splitting 
them off and making them autonomous. They number 14, including 
the parent firm of Toyota itself, Toyota Automatic Loom Works, 
the later merged Daihatsu, et al., with most being parts makers. 
  In the face of the current recession, they have set a 
practice at Toyota of transferring people within the group, as 
is seen in the case of Toyota Auto Body. Further, it is expected 
that from now on, too, they will skillfully control prosperity 
and idleness of the firm itself and of its group firms in car 
types and parts, absorbing any surplus personnel. So, the 
outcome will be that they can deftly work out ways to keep 
people on not only at Toyota but at all the firms. 
  That means they have, even before now, been making a number 
of skillful "cooperative plays" aimed at trying to maintain 
earnings at each firm in the group. As an example, Toyoda 
Boshoku, weak in earning power relative to the others, has in 
the past also been shifting the manufacture of all kinds of 
parts to other companies in the group. Starting this quarter, it 
is even getting orders for air bags from Toyoda Gosei. Again, 
Toyota considered the big deficits of Toyota Machine Works and 
is increasing its orders somewhat. 
  The Toyota group is thought to be showing its ability to 
respond and so to adapt to conditions even in solving personnel 
problems. 
  That being so, its impact on manufacturers with few trading 
or capital connections may be inevitable. 
<H5>  Shifting Overseas Not Easy </H5>
  Expanding overseas production is the inevitable route for 
the 
internationalization of Japanese manufacturers, and an effective 
way to avoid the risks of exchange fluctuations. Toyota's 
overseas production for the 1993 June quarter was 830,000 units, 
and it plans 930,000 for the current quarter. As major bases, 
its plant in England began operation at the end of 1992, and its 
second plant (TMM [Toyoto Motor Manufacturing]) in Kentucky will 
start up in the spring of 1994. 
  At Toyota they speak as follows about their ideas on 
production abroad: "Fundamental, first of all, is that it is 
best to produce locally the cars to be sold abroad. Our plans 
for production overseas were in place before the to-do about the 
high yen. Still, since the past and current pace of the high yen 
has a major effect on exports, a shift overseas is good policy 
even in the sense of avoiding that" (Director Hideichi Kumabe). 
  With all of that, it is no longer true that promoting 
production abroad is all to the good. First, the issue has 
arisen of balancing that against sustaining domestic operating 
rates. The Camry scheduled for production at TMM's Plant No. 2 
is now being built at the Tsutsumi plant in Aichi. TMM's Plant 
No. 2 initially had to raise its operating rate slowly while 
watching the operation of the Tsutsumi plant. 
  Also, it is unrealistic for any and all to be shifted 
abroad. 
Conversely, the carmakers are in a situation where they can 
neither achieve a considerable global division of functions in a 
progressive way nor escape exchange-rate risks. 
  Even at Toyota, says Director Kumabe, "We are even studying 
something we could call an international horizontal division of 
functions--where it would be good, in the future, to build and 
where to sell, taking a more global view than we do now. Yet, 
there are problems of distribution costs and each nation's legal 
restrictions on auto imports, so that it is not easy." 
  In short, some exported cars will have to continue 
indefinitely to be built in Japan even as it is further raising 
its labor costs, high by international standards, and while 
remaining exposed to the risk of the high yen's progress. 
  It may be that Toyota's December 1993 interim accounts 
settlement will fall into an operating deficit. The "10 billion 
yen" which is the company's stated goal was premised on 110 yen 
per dollar, but it is all but certain that the reality will be a 
yen higher than that. One analyst foresees that "if Toyota goes 
into a deficit balance at this time, the other auto firms may 
`feel at ease' about the 1994 March quarter and announce 
deficits." 
  But, about the time that the other companies put out their 
March quarter balances, Toyota may be steadily pushing forward 
its policies for resolving the problems it currently confronts. 
One cannot gainsay the possibility that its soft-landing 
scenario will link into the other firms' hard landing.

<F P=106> [Article by Naohiro Yashiro, Sophia University professor and </F>
senior researcher for the Japan Economic Research Center: "The 
Cost and Benefits of Stable Employment"] 
  [Text] A unique characteristic at this point in the 
current prolonged economic slump is that adjustments in 
employment are not matching the extent to which production has 
fallen. And there is no guarantee that this will continue into 
the future. Meanwhile, looking to the mid to long term, 
employment stability which is based on Japanese-style employment 
practices must change as it now stands. 
  The pressing employment issue is intertwined with complex 
elements involving short-, mid-, and long-term aspects. 
  First, there is great fear that the prolonged slump will 
relegate into the ranks of the unemployed a great number of 
still employed but surplus workers through massive employment 
adjustments. 
  Furthermore, the difference between foreign and domestic 
wages as viewed from a dollar base in concert with the sharply 
higher yen is growing ever larger. As a result, there is 
accelerated investment in overseas manufacturing, which has 
given rise to anxiety over the gap between production and 
employment. 
  Finally, with the solid trend toward an aging population and 
work force, a long-term task is to reconsider Japanese-style 
employment practices and management system. 
<H5>  The Current Situation of Employment Stability </H5>
  The current business recession, which started at the 
beginning of 1991 and then apparently having hit bottom at the 
beginning of 1993 but followed by the emergence of the high yen, 
again continues. With the possibility that the economic growth 
rate during fiscal 1993 will be still lower than the less than 
one percent growth rate of the preceding year, the lowest since 
the latter half of the seventies, the result is the fear that 
this will be the longest recession since the end of World War II. 
  One major and unique characteristic of the current business 
recession is the stability of employment compared to the 
previous high yen slump. Despite an average 6.3 percent drop in 
manufacturing production during fiscal 1992, the number of 
regularly employed people compared to the preceding year 
remained stable and for the first half of 1993 dropped to a 
level just 0.7 percent below the preceding year and stayed 
there. This is the major difference compared to the previous 
high yen slump where the drop in production and employment 
stayed roughly in the same range. 
  Against this background are the following two major factors. 
First is the steep adjustment in work hours which occurred this 
time as part of the process of reducing production activity. 
With the reduction in prescribed work hours and the spread of 
the five-day work week, there was a steep reduction of slightly 
more than 3 percent (during the high yen slump it was slightly 
less than 1 percent) in the total work hour base. 
  The heightened demand for a subrogated work force in concert 
with this short-term development is a major factor in the 
avoidance of a steep decline in regular employment. The total 
committed work base, comprised of hours, was lower than for the 
previous high yen slump. 
  Furthermore, the wage adjustment mechanism worked more 
effectively this time. During the previous high yen slump, the 
cost of real wages (deflation in wholesale prices) rose to a 
remarkably high level due to the high yen and the steep drop in 
the price of oil and despite a slump in production activity. 
This time, in contrast, the gentle rate of increase in the cost 
of real wages for 1992 was slightly more than 2 percent, given 
the fact that the drop in the price of manufactured goods was 
trifling. 
  In this way, real wages and the adjustment in work hours 
were 
effectively accomplished. In terms of this recession, despite a 
steep drop in work productivity accompanying the drop in 
production activity, the rate of increase for companies in unit 
work cost (the cost of real wages divided by work productivity) 
remained at about the same level as for the previous peak. 
<H5>  A "Myth" To Be Tested </H5>
  However, it is doubtful that employment stability will 
continue in the latter half of fiscal 1993 as it has up to now. 
  First, there is little room for a further reduction in work 
hours, which have already reached a remarkably low level. 
Furthermore, we are in a situation where wholesale prices have 
dropped 3 percent over last year under the continued high yen, 
with little room remaining for adjustments in real wages if the 
solidification of nominal wages in the downward direction is any 
precedent. This is one basis for the "wage reduction argument" 
which would involve the lowering of the nominal wage base during 
the spring labor offensive. 
  There is exceedingly little possibility that such a "wage 
reduction" will occur. Rather, should production activity be 
fully restored in fiscal 1993, the level of unit work cost will 
be higher still and will be a major factor in putting additional 
pressure on company earnings. 
  Were we to mechanically calculate the amount of necessary 
reduction in employment because unit work costs for 
manufacturing at the beginning of fiscal 1993 remained at a par 
with the preceding year, we would get a 10-percent reduction 
(about 800,000 people) over the preceding year and from the 
viewpoint of manufacturing costs would become an appropriate 
standard in establishing surplus employment in companies. On the 
other hand, should most of this be absorbed by the market, the 
unemployment rate would be 3 percent. 
  Furthermore, the pressure for adjustments in employment is 
particularly striking for the management ranks. As a result of 
reduced operations which were vigorously implemented during the 
first half of the eighties, the number of people employed 
professionally as managers dropped despite economic growth. 
However, since 1986 the tide turned once again to rapid 
additions in staff and, compared to the trend (based on the GNP 
price elasticity) for 1991, the base for all industries now 
shows a surplus of nearly 170,000 people. 
  This is based on accelerating growth in the number of 
employees as a whole and a 20-percent increase during the past 
six years in the number of professional managers. What made this 
possible was excessive creation of subsidiaries by major 
companies caused by latent profits in real estate during the 
bubble economy. In this sense, to the degree that adjustments 
were not made during the previous high yen slump, the pressure 
for reducing the number of management positions has increased 
during this business recession. 
  The guarantee of stable employment during business 
recessions 
has been accepted up to this point as a tacit contract arising 
from the Japanese-style employment system. There are those who 
question the responsibility of management vis-a-vis implementing 
of forced employment reductions by major companies. However, it 
is not that major Japanese companies have never adopted 
reductions in force in the past, rather they have delayed them 
as much as a year and a half when compared to U.S. firms. 
  The conditions that made this possible were the work hours 
and the heightened adjustment force of real wages. Furthermore, 
during those periods the brevity of the business recession 
always pointed to a business recovery. With the latter half of 
fiscal 1993 indicating a strong possibility that these 
conditions will not be met at all, this may become the time when 
the myth that "big business equals stable employment" will be 
questioned. 
<H5>  The High Yen and the Hollowing Out of Industry </H5>
  The continuing high yen, a major factor in the lengthening 
of 
the current recession, has rekindled the risk of a hollowed-out 
industry, which had been trumpeted during the previous high yen 
slump. The high yen, which has climbed to nearly 100 to the 
dollar, is only one-fourth what it was during the 1985-87 period 
in terms of rate of increase. 
  A major factor for the serious acceptance of the current 
high 
yen has been the inability to shift smoothly from external to 
internal demand, eliminating other factors of the earlier high 
yen period such as: 1) correction of the overly cheap yen during 
first half of the eighties; 2) improvement in trade as a result 
of the steep drop in crude oil prices; and 3) financial 
deregulation and increased corporate earnings bolstered by 
skyrocketing asset values. 
  That is to say, the current high yen, facing a time of 
corporate strength weakened by a steep business recession and 
the explosive drop in asset values, is having a greater impact 
than would appear on the surface. 
  Furthermore, from the fact that the automobile and 
electronics industries, which were eagerly making direct 
overseas investments during the previous high yen time and 
simultaneously investing aggressively in plants and equipment 
domestically, the hollowed-out production argument results in 
needless fear. However, if we look back in terms of the current 
state of things, another factor was that the chief export 
industries, primarily automobiles and electronics, in 
simultaneously making broad domestic and direct overseas 
investments, created a surplus of plants and equipment, 
prolonging the inventory adjustment period. 
  The response to the high yen by Japanese companies who have 
learned this lesson will be different this time. Furthermore, it 
is significant that many businesses already producing in earnest 
overseas have made few investments compared to the previous high 
yen period. In this alone there is the strong possibility that 
companies are responding with care to the differences between 
foreign and domestic production costs. In the future this will 
strengthen the trend for still higher production overseas as 
opposed to domestic production. 
  However, on the other hand, judging by questionnaires of 
most 
companies, the view that 120 yen to the dollar is an appropriate 
exchange rate and that export industries will be dealt a major 
blow should the yen go any higher than this, raises many doubts. 
  Although the five-year average exchange rate preceding the 
high yen from the beginning of this fiscal year was stable at 
about 134 yen to the dollar, the difference in the inflation 
rate between the United States and Japan during that time was on 
the average close to 3 percent in terms of wholesale prices and 
the real base in the yen versus the dollar means that for this 
period the yen was almost 15 percent cheaper. This is to say, in 
terms of the nominal base, the stability of the exchange rate 
for Japan, which has had a remarkably low inflation rate among 
advanced nations, means depreciation in terms of the real base. 
The high yen this time signifies this kind of adjustment in the 
direction of a cheaper yen. 
  The high yen provides an opportunity to increase the 
pressure 
for restructuring domestic industry, which has been protected by 
the system, including agriculture, through the growing foreign 
and domestic price differential. Although productivity in some 
areas of manufacturing in Japan is extremely high, productivity 
for industry as a whole in 1991 compared to the United States 
and the chief countries of Europe was 20 percent lower (from a 
base of purchasing parity). 
  Facilitating movement of workers from areas of low 
productivity to highly productive ones through deregulation is a 
fundamental strategy for linking increased demand for high yen 
profits and for avoiding a hollowing out of employment. 
<H5>  Changing Japanese-Style Employment </H5>
  The fact that Japanese companies, which have been facing a 
business recession, did not immediately resort to layoffs as is 
done in the United States but instead sustained surplus 
employment by sacrificing corporate profits has been taken as a 
manifestation of their sense of social responsibility. 
  Consequently, fear is widespread that, should the underlying 
relationship of trust between employer and employee collapse 
through a large-scale employment adjustment, in particular 
through the dismissal of midcareer and senior employees with 
many years of service, companies will lose the industriousness 
of the worker and over the long term the vitality of the 
Japanese economy will be weakened. 
  However, Japanese-style employment, which is based on the 
seniority system and employment stability, must undergo wide 
ranging alteration, whether we like it or not, brought on by a 
major change in the external environment, the long-term aging of 
Japan's population. 
  The percentage of aged will double in the next 30 years and, 
furthermore, the rate of increase in the supply of workers in 
the 1990's will be half that of the 1980's, which means that we 
will once again be facing reductions as we enter the 21st 
century. It is a very different situation where up to now Japan 
has been supported by a high-quality, abundant work force. 
  The elements that will sustain the greatest impact from this 
are the seniority system and the wage scales that are based on 
age and reflect seniority. Wage scales that provide increases in 
the average wage based on current age have in general been 
accepted as subsistence supplement [seikatsu kyu] based on a 
worker's need to provide for increased educational fees for his 
children. 
  However, perhaps these major Japanese companies been 
practicing something akin to the communist principle of "from 
each according to his ability, to each according to his need." 
  Rather, a better explanation is that wages increase on the 
basis of age and years of continuous service rather than 
stemming from an economic theory that a portion of the profits 
from the investment in human capital which communicate 
discipline within the company are restored in the form of wages 
based on years of service in order to keep an employee with the 
company. In this case, a wage system based on years of service 
is a factor in that the average white collar worker can bear the 
burden of raising and educating his children, except that this 
is not the outcome. 
  If the wage system is not paternalism by business but is the 
result of corporate policy toward the investment of human 
capital in a pyramidal age structure reflecting the population 
and Japan's high growth rate since World War II, the increasing 
average age of the work force and a lower average economic 
growth rate could weaken the corporate will toward investment in 
human capital and actually work toward lowering the slope of the 
wage profile. 
  Furthermore, should the situation develop that stockholders, 
and chiefly institutional investors, more and more be unwilling 
to accept excess employment and the sacrificing of company 
profits during business recessions as has been the case up to 
now, companies all the more will move toward the curtailment of 
employees who are subject to entrenched personnel practices. 
  Should this materialize, the incentive for an employee to 
remain with one company as has been the case to this point will 
diminish. Furthermore, the chronic need for labor and the 
inadequate labor force will work to heighten the trend toward 
increased unemployment along with increased employment 
opportunities at midcareer. 
  This situation was already strikingly evident at some 
companies during the last stage of the Heisei recession. Should 
the behavior of employees become fluid and not fit into the 
framework of a specific company, employment practices more and 
more will have to change regarding this. 
<H5>  Compensations for Employment Stability </H5>
  Up to this point the embracing of an surplus work force by 
Japanese companies during business recessions has been highly 
praised as a demonstration of their social responsibility. 
However, the Japanese worker is forced to make many sacrifices 
in return for employment stability. 
  First is the chronically long work week. In an employment 
system which adds long overtime hours to the normal day, 
reducing work hours during business recessions can regulate the 
amount of work invested. Indeed, this is a system that exists in 
order to use precious human capital to the maximum. For U.S. and 
European companies that lack this kind of overtime buffer, a 
drop in production activity must immediately be tied to layoffs. 
  Second are the frequent transfers and temporary assignments 
to affiliated companies. Japanese employees are obliged to do 
what the company orders in return for guaranteed employment. As 
a result, the reshuffling of office and production workers among 
business activities during recessions is everyday fare. In going 
beyond the basic need for this, many companies attempt this as a 
kind of "shock treatment" in order to generate a sense of crisis 
in the employee. However, the psychological suffering is 
incalculable for older workers who are dispatched to unfamiliar 
jobs. 
  Third is the 30 percent of white-collar workers in their 
forties who make unaccompanied transfers caused by reshuffling 
stemming from transfers effected without regard to business 
conditions. To attribute this to the issue of a worker's family 
and his children's education is myopic. For example, even were 
this not the issue, moving a family from a town to which they 
are accustomed to unknown territory for the convenience of the 
company is totally unacceptable in European and U.S. societies. 
  Finally, the fixed employment system of large companies is a 
major factor in the substantial differences in wages. This is to 
say, the fact that women who must work for the sake of their 
homes and their children are actually excluded from the 
seniority system is the reason why the average difference in 
wages between men and women is the largest in Japan among 
advanced nations. 
  Furthermore, an aged-based system, which uniformly makes 
retirement compulsory despite differences in individual ability 
at a particular age, sanctions "age discrimination" which is 
prohibited by law in the United States. 
  Moreover, whenever a male employee 40 or older tries to 
change jobs to seek new opportunities, he faces the disadvantage 
that the amount of retirement he will receive is severely 
reduced because he is interrupting his years of continuous 
service. This factor prevents the effective employment of 
precious human talent which could benefit another company. 
  It is true that working conditions have improved drastically 
in the development of the postwar Japanese economy with the 
promotion of wage increases and shorter work weeks. However, 
companies dictate repeated shuffling of personnel, and older 
employees, who have skills useful only to a specific company, 
also face compulsory retirement and are forced to transfer to 
job sites with extremely poor working conditions. Moreover, it 
is also true that those in management are coerced into early 
retirement or are put on temporary retirement transfers to 
subsidiaries in advance of their formal retirement age. 
<H5>  Improving Employment Policies </H5>
  There is a surplus work force, the time when employment 
stability was the greatest concern is gone, the inadequacy of 
the aging work force is becoming universal, and the negotiating 
strength of the worker is increasing. The coming issue, 
therefore, is not simply one of employment stability, but of 
having a choice in work content. 
  Should that happen, it will often be more advantageous for a 
company to keep common specialized technologies on hand than to 
focus simply on management positions. 
  For the worker there are more fundamental advantages with an 
inadequate work force than for the company. The prerequisite is 
to create a society in which one can choose one's retirement and 
have individual choice in work content. 
  The chief aim of Japanese employment policy until now has 
been to reduce unemployment by underwriting entrenched 
employment practices. However, the entrenched employment 
practices are a major cause of the sharp differences in working 
conditions for senior workers above retirement age and married 
women, not to mention the cost of job shuffling, frequent 
transfers, and chronic overtime. 
  The limitations in the supply of the work force will 
intensify as we enter the 21st century. Moreover, as the ratio 
of older workers and women grows, the social cost of entrenched 
employment practices will steadily increase. The current 
"lifetime employment system" is already changing and in the 
future adjustments to employment centering on management 
positions will steadily strengthen. 
  Given this situation, support to entrenched corporate 
employment practices through subsidies as government policy may 
be unavoidable in the short term. However, policies will be 
needed for the long term which give mobility to workers 
broadening the range of choices he can make beyond of dependency 
on one particular company. 
  To this end, it will be necessary to abolish the 
preferential 
tax system which does not allow an employee to defer pay into a 
retirement fund, and in its place establish a government policy 
such as for welfare payments that make it possible to move to an 
accounting system for company retirements that is not 
disadvantageous to transfers between companies. 
  Furthermore, employment mobility will stimulate the need for 
a shift toward practical life experience over the university 
education which primarily fulfills the function of qualitative 
selection for entry into major companies. Furthermore, the 
possibility exists that the non-productive behavior of working 
any number of years in order to enter a famous university will 
be reduced should midcareer employment opportunities with major 
companies expand. 
  Reform of the Japanese educational system will be 
indispensable for improving the labor market, which will be the 
way out.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 5 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- In the 
course of the counting of the cattle conducted in the country by 
the end of the last year some 25.5 million head of five kinds 
cattle were registered to be belonging to private farmers of 
Mongolia which is 89.6 percent of the total number of livestock 
of the country. More than two million head of cattle are 
falling on the share of agricultural companies with 
state-running ownership. They account for mainly pedigree 
highly-productive herds and flocks. Since 1992 the number of 
cattle having been privately owned has been increased by more 
than four million due to a reprivatization of the cattle 
belonging to the agricultural organizations.

  [Text] President Ramos has issued four executive orders 
[EO] that will implement the Philippine program of reducing 
tariff rates of 15 groups of products effective January 1994 in 
compliance with the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). 
  The president issued EO 145 up to 148 which he signed on 
Monday, 27 December -- all of which will take effect 1 January 
1994 except EO 148, which takes effect 30 days after publication 
of the directive in two newspapers of general circulation. 
  For this purpose, the president approved the modified rates 
of duty as provided for under the Tariff and Customs Code of 
1978, as amended, to implement the 1994 Philippine schedule of 
tariff reductions on the 15 articles included in the accelerated 
and normal programs of the Common Effective Preferential Tariff 
(CEPT) scheme for the AFTA. 
  The 15 groups of products included in the CEPT scheme for 
accelerated tariff reductions are: vegetable oils, cement, 
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, plastics, rubber 
products, leather products, pulp, textiles, ceramics and glass 
products, gems and jewelry, copper cathodes, electronics, and, 
wooden and rattan furnitures. 
  In EO 145, the president said that the six member states of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have agreed 
that there is a need to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers 
that only serve to impede intra-ASEAN trade. The six member 
countries of the ASEAN includes the Philippines, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, and Thailand. The ASEAN member 
countries have agreed to improve the existing Preferential 
Trading Arrangements (PTA) in this regard. 
  To boost economic cooperation and intra-ASEAN trading, the 
ASEAN member countries have agreed to do this through the CEPT 
scheme which set a time frame of 15 years beginning January 1993 
to reduce tariff rates from zero to five percent. 
  EO 145 says that products identified by the Philippines for 
accelerated rate reduction under the CEPT scheme for the AFTA, 
tariff rates (MFN/PTA) [expansion unknown] of 20 percent or 
below shall be reduced to five percent and zero by 1 Jan 2000, 
while tariff rates (MFN/PTA) above 20 percent shall be reduced 
to five percent and zero by 1 January 2003. 
  For products identified by the Philippines for "normal rate 
reduction," the tariff reduction to five percent and zero shall 
be done in two stages, namely: 
  -- For products with existing tariff rates (MFN/PTA) of 20 
percent or below, tariffs shall be reduced to five percent and 
zero through a seven-year program starting 1 January 1996 up to 
1 January 2003; and, 
  -- For products with existing tariff rates (MFN/PTA) above 
20 
percent, tariffs shall be reduced to 20 percent by 1 January 
2001. The subsequent reduction of tariff rates from 20 percent 
to five percent and zero shall be done within seven years, with 
the minimum rate of reduction set at five percentage points 
every two years starting 1 January 2004 up to 1 January 2008. 
  EO 146 amends EO 43, series of 1992 by modifying the margins 
of preference (MOP) and the applicable ASEAN Preferential 
Tariffs on certain items included in the coverage in the 
Philippine Exclusion List. In EO 43, the rates of duty of 
certain imported articles as provided for under the Tariff and 
Customs Code of the Philippines of 1978, as amended, provided a 
minimum level of 25 percent MOPs in certain items in the 
exclusion list. 
  EO 147 modifies the rates of duty on certain imported 
articles as provided for in the Tariff Code to implement the 10 
percent (MOP) granted by the Philippines under the agreement on 
the Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP) among developing 
countries as set forth in the Philippine schedule of concessions. 
  The agreement on the GSTP was ratified by the Philippine 
Senate on 2 September 1991 but the government has yet to 
implement this international trade pact it inked with 47 other 
developing countries. 
  EO 148, modifies the rates of duty on certain imported 
articles as provided for under Presidential Decree 1464, as 
amended, otherwise known as the Tariff Code of 1978. 
  Under the country's 1987 Constitution, the president is 
empowered to amend tariff rates in case Congress is not in 
session. Congress adjourned for the Christmas holidays and will 
not resume sessions until next month. 
  In the case of cane or best sugar and chemically pure 
sucrose 
in solid form, including raw sugar, not containing added 
flavoring or coloring matter, the existing duty rate of 70 
percent was reduced to 60 percent effective 1 July 1994 and down 
farther to 50 percent by 1 July 1995. 
  Prawn feeds remained at 20 percent import duty, as well as 
gelatin, pharmaceutical grade and closed sterile water system 
for inhalation, both at 10 percent. Unassembled starter motors 
will remain at three percent. 
  Vulcanized rubber thread and cord will remain at the present 
30 percent duty rate until July 1994 but will be reduced to 20 
percent by 1995. 
  Pile fabrics of 100 percent polyester staple fibers used in 
the manufacture of paint rollers measuring 2-1/2 to 3 inches in 
width will be reduced to 10 percent.

  [Text] President Ramos yesterday moved to streamline the 
bureaucracy by transferring 15 agencies and corporations under 
government departments. 
  Following the cabinet workshop last Tuesday, the president 
issued Executive Order No. 149, calling for the transfer of 
regular agencies to mother departments for "better policy and 
program coordination and integration and administrative 
supervision." Moreover, he directed the affected agencies to 
prepare within two months a Function, Rationalization and 
Integration Program (FRlP) which will be assessed by the budget 
and management secretary, who will in turn make a full report 
and recommendation to the president. 
  Moreover, Mr. Ramos said that the FRIP should include the 
streamlining and rationalization of the agency's functions, 
programs, and activities; the policy integration and 
rationalization plan for the departments affected by the 
transfer, and, the significant refocusing, abolition, scaling 
down or phasing out of functions, programs and activities, and 
the corresponding shifts in structure and resource allocation. 
  The following agencies have been affected: 
  -- the National Statistical Coordination Board, to the 
National Economic and Development Authority [NEDA]; 
  -- the Commission on Filipino Language, to the Department 
of Education, Culture and Sports; 
  -- the Philippine Center Management Board, to the 
Department of Foreign Affairs; 
  -- the National Statistics Office to NEDA; and, 
  -- the Statistical Research and Training Center to NEDA. 
  Government-owned and controlled corporations transferred to 
government departments include: 
  -- the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation, to the 
Department of Finance; 
  -- the Laguna Lake Development Authority, to the 
Department of Environment and Natural Resources; and, 
  -- the Philippine Center for Economic Development, to the 
University of the Philippines System. 
  On another note, the chief executive likewise ordered the 
transfer of six agencies set to be abolished to departments for 
the time being. These are: 
  -- the Economic Support Fund Secretariat, to the Department 
of Public Works and Highways; 
  -- the Board of Liquidators, to the National Development 
Corporation; 
  -- the Development Coordinating Council for Leyte and 
Samar and the Kalinga Special Development Authority, to the 
Department of National Defense; 
  -- the Sequestered Assets Disposition Authority, to the 
Presidential Commission on Good Government; 
  -- the Philippine Human Resources Development Center, to 
the Presidential Management Staff; and, 
  -- the Philippine Gamefowl Commission, to the Games and 
Amusements Board.

  [Text] A total of 353 critical public infrastructure and 
social services projects, with an aggregate cost of P67.771 
billion [Philippine pesos], has been approved by the Ramos 
Cabinet the other day to form part of the Core Public Investment 
Program (CPIP) next year, the National Economic and Development 
Authority (NEDA) announced yesterday. 
  Out of the total, only P23.008 billion will be shouldered by 
the national government as most of the projects will be funded 
either by international financial institutions or through 
internal cash generation resources of government-owned and 
controlled corporations [GOCCs]. 
  In real budgetary terms, government will shell out P21.212 
billion in local counterpart funds and subsidies to government 
corporations and the GOCCs will give P1.796 billion through 
their incomes. 
  Based on the aide-memoire submitted to the President, the 
CPIP projects will be "spared from any budget cuts even if 
government's fiscal position worsens during the year," with the 
end view of "restoring government's effectiveness in 
implementing critical projects." 
  Based on the approved list of core investments, 
agro-industrial development projects accounted for 55 projects 
amounting to P1.861 billion; human development sector, 64 
projects costing P4.906 billion; infrastructure support sector, 
222 projects worth P60.842 billion; development administration, 
five projects worth P12.896 million; and disaster mitigation 
projects, six projects worth P149.156 million. 
  Among the selected projects, 188 are included under Category 
A, which is composed of ongoing and new foreign-assisted 
projects such as capital activities in basic education, water 
supply, health, nutrition, family planning, and, housing; 128 
fall under Category B, which is composed of energy-related 
projects; and, 37 projects fall under Category C, which are 
locally funded. 
  Based on the CPIP concept, the agencies concerned are tasked 
to immediately prepare their work and financial plans for the 
projects, which will be the basis for the budget releases to be 
made by the Department of Budget and Management [DBM]. 
  "One unwritten rule which was adopted by the DBM is the 30 
percent-30 percent-20 percent-20 percent quarterly budget 
release pattern for the CPIP projects," a NEDA official said. 
"Effectively, the projects will receive 60 percent of their 
share in the first half of the year." 
  A performance contract will be drawn up between the agencies 
and President Ramos for closer monitoring of these projects.

  [Text] The government has accepted the request of exiled 
communist leader Luis Jalandoni for a preliminary meeting before 
the second round of exploratory peace talks are held in Vietnam 
next year. 
  Howard Dee, former ambassador to the Vatican and chief 
government peace negotiator with the communist rebels, said the 
acceptance of Jalandoni's request removed a stumbling block in 
the talks. 
  Dee, however, did not say when and where the meeting could 
take place. 
  He said the government's panel position was that the issue 
be 
included in the talks in Hanoi the capital of Vietnam. 
  The National Democratic Front (NDF), political arm of the 
Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), has set a number of 
preconditions before it could sit down for talks in Vietnam. 
  Among these are the release of 300 political prisoners and 
the government's insistence that the negotiation be conducted 
under the framework of the Philippine Constitution. 
  The second precondition has proved the most difficult to 
overcome. 
  However, Dee said that the preliminary meeting could still 
proceed by taking up issues such as the ground rules for 
substantive talks, safety and immunity guarantees for peace 
representatives, and all other technical arrangements. 
  Dee also reminded Jalandoni that when they signed The Hague 
Declaration in September 1992, they agreed that "no precondition 
shall be made to negate the inherent character and purpose of 
the peace negotiations." 
  "With the onset of the New Year, and the hope it brings, we 
urge Mr. Jalandoni to come to the negotiating table to implement 
The Hague Declaration so that together we may give peace a 
chance," Dee said. 
  He said Vietnam has already agreed to host the talks but 
would not take direct part in it. 
  Hanoi wanted to adopt Jakarta's position in facilitating 
only 
peace talks between the Philippine government and dissident 
factions, like the Muslim secessionist and communist guerrillas. 
  The last time government representatives talked with 
communist leaders in the Netherlands in September last year when 
the Ramos government first opened its doors for peaceful 
resolution of the 25-year-old Maoist rebellion.

  [Text] Baguio City -- Former rebel priest Conrado Balweg 
has agreed to return all firearms issued by the government to 
the Cordillera People's Liberation Army [CPLA] but he stood firm 
in his position that any integration of his group in the 
military or police should be within the law. 
  Balweg, who heads one faction of the CPLA, held marathon 
meetings here Wednesday and yesterday with Interior Secretary 
Rafael Alunan III and military officials in the region. 
  "I am willing to integrate as long as it is within the 
context of Executive Order [EO] 220," said Balweg. 
  EO 220, which was signed by President Aquino in July 1987, 
created the Cordillera Administrative Region. Among other 
things, it mandates the creation of a regional security force to 
help in the defense and security of the region. 
  Balweg said this provision of the law has not been 
implemented. 
  A group that split from Balweg early this year has started 
training in Camp Aquino in Tarlac for integration in the 
military as a part of the Civilian Armed Forces Geographical 
Unit (Cafgu). 
  The splinter group is headed by lawyer Joel Obar, head of 
the 
Cordillera Bodong Administration and Mayor Mailed Molina of 
Bucloc, Abra. 
  But Balweg questioned the formation of the group, saying 
that 
"it was outside the law and was only creating confusion and 
disunity in the region." 
  According to him, of the 303 supposed CPLA men training in 
Camp Aquino, only 17 are active members. 
  "Kung may kaguluhan ngayon, ang may kagagawan niyan sila. 
(If there is confusion now, they should be the ones to blame)," 
he said. 
  Balweg agreed to return all firearms issued to his group 
when 
it broke away from the New People's Army [NPA] and signed a 
peace agreement with the Aquino Government at the Mount Data 
Lodge in Bauko, Mountain Province, on 13 September 1986. 
  He said he was waiting for the list of CPLA men who were 
given firearms. 
  "I told Alunan that they should give me the list so I can 
help them locate these. Dahil malinaw naman sa akin na hiram 
'yan (It's clear to me these firearms were loaned to us)," he 
said. 
  Balweg said 50 Armalite rifles were donated to the CPLA by 
the Aquino Government in 1988 as a commitment to the 
implementation of EO 220, specifically on the formation of the 
regional security force. 
  In 1989 when the NPA intensified its armed attacks against 
the CPLA, Balweg requested for additional 200 Armalite rifles. 
But he said when the 200 firearms were delivered, only 100 were 
individually given to CPLA men in the field. The 100 firearms 
included M-14 and Garand rifles, he added. 
  "Ang gusto kong malaman kung 200 o 100 ang naibigay sa CPLA 
(I want to know if 200 or 100 were given to the CPLA)," Balweg 
said, adding that he has instructed his men in the field to 
return all firearms issued by the government. 
  Balweg earlier threatened to go back to the hills when the 
government insisted that the CPLA return the firearms loaned to 
the former rebels. 
  On the request for his group to vacate the Cordillera House 
here where he and the Cordillera Bodong Administration hold 
office, Balweg said Alunan had agreed to allow them to stay. 
The Cordillera House is across the Mansion House, the 
presidential summer residence.

  [Text] Moro rebel leader Nur Misuari yesterday denounced 
the spate of bombings in Davao City and said he will not allow 
saboteurs to disrupt the peace talks between the government and 
the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). 
  The government, meanwhile, has agreed to meet 
representatives 
of the communist-led National Democratic Front (NDF) before 
holding the next round of exploratory talks in Vietnam. 
  Howard Dee, chair of the government peace panel, however, 
urged the NDF to remove all preconditions for the Vietnam talks, 
saying these were contrary to The Hague Declaration signed by 
the two parties last year. 
  "We...condemn the dastardly act of bombing sacred places, 
the 
church and the mosques of Davao City," Misuari said at the 
resumption of government-MNLF talks in Timbangan town. 
  Misuari told Bangsa Moro [Moro Nation] supporters he will 
not 
allow anybody to sabotage the talks. He said the MNLF units in 
Davao City were ready to go after the persons responsible for 
the bombings of the Davao cathedral and mosques. 
  Also attending the affair were Representative Eduardo 
Ermita, 
government peace representatives, and observers from the 
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) of Six led by 
Indonesian Ambassador Yusbar Jamil. 
  The perpetrators of the bombings "...will not succeed, as 
unity and peace in Mindanao will be achieved and will reign," he 
said. 
  Meanwhile, the GRP [government of the Republic of the 
Philippines]-MNLF "mixed" support committees which convened 
Tuesday noon named the cities of Zamboanga, Cotabato, Marawi, 
General Santos and Manila as the next venues for the peace talks. 
  The schedules are: cease fire committee -- 5, 6, 7, January, 
Zamboanga City; defense -- 10, 11, 12 January, Cotabato City; 
administration -- 13, 14, 15 January, Manila; shariah -- 17, 
18, 19 January, Marawi City, and 27, 28 29 January, General 
Santos City; economics -- 20, 21 January, Zamboanga City; and ad 
hoc -- 7, 8, 9 February, Zamboanga City. 
  The "mixed" committees will meet in Zamboanga City, but the 
dates have not yet been agreed upon. 
  The ad hoc committee is headed by Interior Undersecretary 
Alexander Aguirre, with Ermita, Makabankit Lanto, Baltazar Sator 
and Department of Justice Undersecretary De Castro as members. 
  Heading the five MNLF committees are Lieutenant General 
Thambayopha Manjoarsa, defense and security; Dr. Jawali Laja, 
education; lawyer Jose Lorena, finance, mines and resources; 
lawyer Didagen Dilangalen, administrative; and Ustadz Shariff 
Zain Jali, judiciary and shariah. 
  The OIC was represented in the Timbangan meeting by 
Ambassador Jamil, Libyan Ambassador Abdulaziz Azzaroukh and 
Indonesian Consul Colonel Muhammad Zaini. 
  In a press statement, Dee cited as a "precondition" the 
rebels' demand for the withdrawal of Executive Order (EO) No. 
125, issued by President Ramos on 15 September 1993. 
  NDF peace representative Luis Jalandoni has said the order 
threw "a monkey wrench into the peace process" and accused the 
government of imposing the Philippine Constitution as framework 
for the peace negotiations. 
  Jalandoni, in a statement issued in Utrecht, the Netherlands 
in October threatened to pull out from the Vietnam talks if the 
government did not recall the executive order. 
  Dee said the order "defines the approach and administrative 
structure for the government's comprehensive peace efforts 
and...clothes the government panel with its authority to 
negotiate peace settlement." 
  He said it is the government's responsibility to follow the 
"Rule of law and Constitutional processes" in pursuing a "just 
and comprehensive and lasting peace." 
  Instead, Dee said, Jalandoni "takes issue with the reference 
in EO 125 and insists on resolving this issue even before the 
holding of the exploratory talks in Vietnam. 
  "Any disagreement on this issue should be elevated for 
discussion ion the Vietnam exploratory talks as these talks are 
intended precisely to reach common understanding for us to 
proceed to the formal talks," he said. 
  Dee said that without the "preconditions," the preliminary 
meeting can take place to prepare the agenda and ground rules 
for the exploratory talks." 
  The former ambassador to the Vatican also urged Jalandoni to 
"come to the negotiations table to implement The Hague 
Declaration so that together we may give peace a chance." 
  "Our people deserve nothing less."

  [Text] The government peace panel is trying to resolve 
five key issues with representatives of the secessionist Moro 
National Liberation Front (MNLF) in a bid to clear the way for 
the resumption of formal peace talks in Jakarta in March, a top 
official of the Department of Interior and Local Governments 
(DILG) said yesterday. 
  Alexander Aguirre, DILG undersecretary for peace and order 
and a member of the panel, told the CHRONICLE the issues to be 
resolved by the technical and ad hoc working committees of both 
panels between now and the second week of February were: Muslim 
representation in government, defense, administrative systems, 
economic and financial systems, and education. 
  Aguirre said the issues were raised during a five-hour 
meeting between the two committees at the MNLF headquarters in 
Barangay [village] Timbangan, Indangan, Sulu last Tuesday. 
  In that meeting, Yusbar Jamil, the Indonesian Embassy's 
Councilor-Minister, and Indonesian Ambassador Rajab Azzarouo [as 
published], acted as moderators. Batangas Representative 
Eduardo Ermita, vice chairman of the government panel, headed 
the government's group of technical committees while MNLF 
Chairman Nur Misuari himself was Ermita's counterpart. 
  Aguirre said the technical committees of both panels would 
be 
holding a series of meetings in Manila, Zamboanga City and 
Cotabato City to hammer out a common stand on the issues. 
  The technical committees' output will then be submitted for 
review and final approval by the government and MNLF peace 
panels after the second week of February, in time for the 
resumption of formal talks in March. 
  "The peace process is on course and there are positive 
indications that true reconciliation will be achieved," Aguirre 
said, adding that the recent meeting in Sulu was "cordial and 
conciliatory." 
  The undersecretary also said there was a need for both 
panels 
to reconcile differing views on autonomy, which though granted 
under the Constitution, was interpreted differently by both 
sides.

  [Text] Jolo, Sulu -- The joint national government-Moro 
National Liberation Front (MNLF) cease fire committee decided 
that MNLF gives security to the government panel during the 
peace talks in Timbangan, Indanan, Sulu. 
  MNLF chairman Nur Misuari had earlier requested the town of 
Indanan be made the next venue of the talks by the mixed 
committees. The MNLF controls the town of Indanan. There are 
no military men seen in the town. 
  Brig. Gen. Guillermo Ruiz, chairman of the joint national 
government-MNLF cease fire committee, said that the government 
will allow only 15 security escorts for the government panel for 
the duration of the talks. He said that the rest of the 
military forces in Mindanao will be alerted on stand-by basis. 
  Ruiz also said that the MNLF has agreed to keep its forces 
at 
least one kilometer away from the conference site. However, he 
said, the MNLF will allow the members to get closer to the 
conference site on condition that they do not carry firearms. 
  Meanwhile, the joint cease fire committee had also agreed in 
principle to hold its next meeting in Zamboanga City on 5 
January next year. 
  The meeting will finalize the ground rules and guidelines 
for 
the immediate implementation of the cease fire agreement in 
Mindanao. 
  The committee will establish a cease fire monitoring station 
in Zamboanga City after both parties agree on the ground rules 
for the cease fire. 
  A similar monitoring station will be established in 13 
provinces in Mindanao.

<F P=106> [From the "On the level" column by Alex Magno: "The </F>
Resurgence of Communal Conflict"] 
  [Text] The bizarre bombings of the Davao Cathedral and two 
mosques in the same city do not threaten the rapidly progressing 
peace process between government and the MNLF [Moro National 
Liberation Front]. What these acts of terror threaten is the 
existing communal peace between Muslim and Christian communities 
in Mindanao. 
  The peace process is moving on its own momentum. It is 
unlikely to be seriously disturbed by random terrorism. 
  MNLF spokesmen have come out immediately to pronounce the 
peace process safe. Misuari's movement has nothing to gain and 
everything to lose if the bombings precipitate an atmosphere of 
communal conflict. 
  Secessionism has lost the luster it once enjoyed. By 
maintaining a hardline position for too long, the MNLF has been 
marginalized in the politics of Muslim Mindanao. Rival tribal 
leaders have stolen much of Misuari's former clout. The 
movement he leads has been excluded from the new framework of 
factional political positioning in the south -- the autonomous 
government. 
  The MNLF leadership wants desperately to move closer to the 
mainstream. The movement seeks to recover the constituencies it 
once enjoyed when it promised prosperity through nationhood to 
the impoverished Muslim masses. It can begin to move out of the 
political doldrums only if it helps push the peace process 
forward. 
  Misuari understands that. His supporters among the Tausog 
elite, elbowed aside in the struggle for influence over the 
autonomous government, understand that. But not all of the mass 
base of the obsolete secessionist movement grasp the necessity 
for systematically terminating the armed struggle to the 
satisfaction of all. 
  A new virus has entered the already chaotic politics of the 
Islamic communities of the south. That virus is militant 
Islamic fundamentalism. 
  Fundamentalism appropriated the romance that was earlier 
vested in secessionism. In its more moderate mode, this 
creeping fundamentalism has been expressed in the emergence of 
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) -- rival to the MNLF. 
  The MILF has a more pronounced Islamic identity, 
distinguishing it from the distastefully secular MNLF program. 
Although controlled by the traditional aristocratic elites of 
the Maguindanao and Maranao communities, it has positioned 
itself as the expression of Moro self-assertion in an 
increasingly uncertain and fluid reality. But even the MILF 
cannot absorb the more militant variants of Islamic 
fundamentalism. Because of this, more militant minor sects have 
emerged, such as the notorious Abu Sayaf group. 
  The more militant fundamentalist armed bands touch a 
dangerous chord among disenchanted young Muslims. They raise 
the new encroachment of Christian migrants into Muslim land as 
the source of misery for the Moros. They vow to rid the Moros 
of that encroachments. 
  While the MNLF wallowed in the political doldrums, the more 
militant fundamentalist bands captured the imagination of the 
discontented in a series of bold and violent acts. Among these 
are the kidnappings of foreign missionaries. Note that one of 
the demands put forward by the kidnappers of Charles Walton, was 
the expulsion of all foreign (Christian) missionaries from 
Mindanao. 
  For too long, however, the MNLF failed to clarify its own 
position against these rabid bands. They sheltered 
fundamentalist armed groups in their territories. They dealt 
with them with a fraternal soft glove. In the meantime, 
government forces were hesitant to deal forcefully with these 
bands for fear of damaging the peace process. 
  Now the problem has blossomed to such an extent that the 
possibility of Muslim-Christian hostilities could not be 
discounted. Recall that during the kidnapping of Spanish priest 
Bernardo Blanco, Christians in Basilan offered to set up 
vigilante bands. That could repeat itself in Davao. 
  If the situation worsens, government could find itself 
having 
to deal with a re-run of the violence between the "barracudas 
[Muslim group]" and the "ilagas [rats-Christian group]" that 
happened during the late '60s and early '70s. That insane cycle 
of violence was a prelude to full-scale war. 
  Should tensions escalate and communities find themselves 
having to defend themselves with arms, the dance of peace 
between government and the MNLF will be rendered academic. 
There will be too many combatants in the fray to allow for 
predictability. 
  The situation should have been nipped in the bud when the 
Basilan kidnappings began happening. Now the unhealthy 
situation is on the verge of bloom. The MNLF must do something 
more than issue press statements -- or else continue abetting 
the problem.

  [Text] Cambodian government and Khmer Rouge forces have 
agreed to a two-day ceasefire at the request of the Thai 
military in order to allow Thai farmers to harvest their rice 
crops and remove rice stocks to safety. 
  Informed sources said the ceasefire request was made by the 
Thai-Cambodian Border Coordinating Office to the two warring 
factions. 
  The ceasefire, which took effect yesterday, was observed by 
the two rival factions permitting farmers of Tambon Tha Kham and 
Tambon Klong Namsai to harvest rice crops and move out rice 
stocks from Nong Ian, a small piece of Thai territory which juts 
into Cambodia. Several artillery and mortar shells as well as 
rockets fired by both the Cambodian Government and Khmer Rouge 
have smashed into Nong Ian, which is uninhabitated [as 
published] since fighting broke out a week ago. 
  One Thai villager was recently killed by shrapnel from a 
stray shell. 
  A Border Patrol unit yesterday went into Nong Ian where they 
found two unexploded shells which were eventually detonated. 
  Quoting Thai traders who travelled into Cambodia, informed 
sources said the two warring factions had taken advantage of the 
ceasefire to regroup and beef up their forces. 
  Trucks carrying supplies and troops were seen rumbling on 
highways in Ban Nimit and Battambang.

  [Text] Fighting between rival forces of Rangoon government 
troops and minority rebel forces of Khun Sa would have no effect 
on Thai people living along the Thai-Burmese border according to 
Third Army Corps commander Panthep Phuwanatnuluk. 
  He gave his personal assurance that army rangers positioned 
in Mae Ai of Chiang Mai and Mae Chan of Chiang Rai would be 
ready to provide protection to the villagers if fighting spills 
into Thailand. 
  Lt-Gen Panthep yesterday inspected the preparation of 
rangers 
and listened to a briefing about the general situation at the 
Ban Rak Thai border base in Mae Chan District. 
  An official report said some 3,000 Mong Thai Army (MTA) 
soldiers of warlord Khun Sa based in Mong Kan opposite Mae Chan 
District are facing some 4,500 troops of the United Wa State 
Army (UWSA) near Doi Lang opposite Mae Ai District. 
  Fighting might erupt at any moment because the MTA wants to 
seize some parts of Mong Yon which is under the influence of the 
UWSA, the report said. 
  The report also said that several battalions of Burmese 
government soldiers heading for Mong Kan have stopped their 
advance because they believe that the MTA might attack Tachilek 
township opposite Mae Sai District.

  [Text] Thailand will soon open its first embassy in the 
North Africa region in Rabat, the capital of Morocco. 
  "Now that the European Community has formed the single 
market, Thailand considers Morocco as the gateway to the EC 
market," the new Ambassador Narong Khemayothin said. 
  "It will also be the springboard to African countries," he 
told reporters yesterday. 
  Morocco and Thailand established diplomatic ties in 1985. 
Narong said establishing the embassy in Rabat would help 
tighten bilateral relations and later help to increase economic 
cooperation. Thailand currently has a trade surplus with the 
North African kingdom. In 1992, Morocco bought Bt [baht] 213 
million worth of Thai rubber, textiles, equipment parts and 
thread for fishing nets, while its exports of canned fish and 
anchovy, as well as cotton, to Thailand was valued at Bt79 
million. 
  "The trade value is not yet high but we see Morocco as a 
potential production base for fisheries, textiles, as well as 
tourism," the ambassador said. He said Thai investors should 
consider investing in Morocco as there was little foreign 
investment there now. 
  "There will not be fierce competition as there was only 
US$500 million worth of foreign investment in Morocco in 1992," 
he said. Most of that came from Spain, South Korea and China. 
  According to Narong, Morocco has an unlimited quota for its 
textiles from the EU [European Union] market, which could 
benefit Thai businesses if their products were manufactured 
there. 
  Narong said the embassy was expected to be operating next 
month as soon as Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan is 
available to officially host the opening ceremony.

  [Text] Laos has offered to sell Thailand water from rivers 
linked to the Mekong River, according to Deputy Transport and 
Communications Minister Charat Phuachuai. 
  Mr Charat said the offer had been confirmed during his visit 
to Vientiane about three weeks ago by Laotian PM's [Prime 
Minister's] Office Minister Phao Bounnaphon and the deputy 
labour and foreign ministers. 
  Concrete pipes could be built to carry the water from rivers 
across the Mekong River to northern and northeastern river 
networks in Thailand, he said. 
  Each pipe will cost about 1,000 million baht and could be 
completed within two years at a length of over 1,000 metres. 
  The 1,000-million-baht cost excludes funding for technology 
to raise the water so it flows into Thailand to solve the 
drought problem, he said. 
  Mr Charat said the project would be easier than taking water 
direct from the Mekong River as this would require permission 
from Cambodia and Vietnam. 
  The deputy minister cited possible routes for the waterways: 
  -- From the Tha River to the Ing River in Chiang Khong 
District, Chiang Rai Province which links with the Nan River in 
Uttaradit Province; 
  -- From the Ngum and Paksan rivers to the branches of the 
Chi River in either Loei or Nong Khai provinces; 
  -- From the Ngum River to the source of the Phasak River 
in Phetchabun Province (according to Mr Charat, the Phasak River 
could feed the water network for the Central Plains) 
  -- From the Thoen River to a branch of the Mun River in 
Nakhon Phanom Province, and 
  -- From the Se River to the Mun River in Ubon Ratchathani 
Province. 
  If the proposal is supported by the Thai Government, Laos 
has 
agreed to sell the water to Thailand at a per cubic metre rate, 
he said. 
  Mr Charat said the drought is a problem needing urgent 
action 
and Laos wants money to implement projects to develop the 
country.

  [Excerpt] A group of Thai rice exporters has agreed to sell 
50,000 tons of fragrant rice and 197,000 tons of 100 percent 
white B grade rice to Japan. Delivery will be immediate. 
  A Rice Exporters' Association source said the price of 
fragrant rice was about US$530 a ton and 100 percent white B 
grade rice was US$450 a ton. After the sales agreement was 
signed on Monday the local price of fragrant rice increased by 
about 20 baht a picul (60 kilos) to reach 720 baht yesterday. 
  The price had risen since a rumour began that Japan would 
buy 
fragrant rice from Thailand after earlier buying 263,000 tons of 
100 percent white grade B rice or glutinous rice. 
  The total bought from Thailand by Japan will be 417,000 tons 
of 100 percent white B grade rice, 43,000 tons of glutinous rice 
and 50,000 tons of fragrant rice. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The Police Commission yesterday rejected Interior 
Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut's nomination of Pol Gen [Police 
General] Prathin Santipraphop as the new police director 
general, a move that will intensify the power struggle between 
the minister and the police officers' governing body. 
  Proponents of the plan to restructure the Police Commission 
said the rejection underlined the need to curb the power of 
active and retired police officers on the panel and bring the 
police force under the interior minister's control. 
  "I have done my best. I tried to make members of the Police 
Commission understand. The Police Department has suffered 
enough. Everybody should be working together instead of causing 
more confusion," Gen Chawalit said after the commission meeting. 
  Chawalit said the commission had ignored his plea for an 
open 
discussion and vote to decide the nomination for the top police 
job. The commission instead chose to vote by secret ballot. 
  The interior minister acknowledged that the commission was 
legally empowered to reject the nomination, but said he believed 
the decision went against public opinion, which wanted a new 
police chief appointed as soon as possible. He would decide 
before the month is out whether to resubmit Prathin's name or to 
make a new nomination to the commission. 
  Chawalit said he had told Prathin, currently acting police 
chief, to perform his duty to the best of his ability. 
  The interior minister said he would definitely push for the 
restructuring of the Police Commission when the time was right. 
Current members would be consulted. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, speaking to reporters at 
Government House yesterday evening, described the commission 
decision as "unusual", but said he believed it would not in any 
way affect Prathin's authority as acting police chief. 
  "The interior minister will do whatever he sees fit. He may 
want to resubmit the nomination when he chooses to," Chuan said. 
The prime minister also stressed the need to restructure the 
Police Commission to achieve a balance of power between the 
interior minister and the police governing body, but only after 
current problems at the Police Department had been resolved. 
  Prathin told reporters after meeting Chawalit yesterday 
afternoon that he had anticipated the commission would reject 
his appointment. 
  "The Police Commission decided not to approve my nomination. 
That's okay with me. I'm not disheartened. I had expected 
this," the acting police chief said. "I will carry on with my 
duty as long as I receive assignments from Gen Chawalit." 
  He said the commission had not bothered to give any reasons 
why he should not be appointed director general. 
  Later in the evening, after meeting the prime minister at 
Government House, Prathin said he may have to serve as acting 
police chief until his retirement in September this year. 
  "I have the feeling that I may have to continue to serve as 
acting police chief," he said. "As an acting police chief I 
have the full authority of a police director general." [passage

  [Text] Government and opposition representatives have 
agreed on eight initial amendments to the Constitution, 
including reducing the size of the Senate, Chumphon 
Sinlapa-acha, chairman of the House special committee on 
constitutional amendments, said yesterday. 
  However, it was still not clear last night whether the 
opposition as a whole would support the agreement. 
  Speaking after a meeting called by Parliament President 
Marut 
Bunnak, Chumphon said agreement had been reached in principle on 
all 25 proposals put forward by his committee. 
  They agreed that priority should be given to eight 
amendments: 
  -- To reduce the voting age from 20 to 18. 
  -- To vary the number of MPs in line with the increase in 
population. 
  -- To reduce the minimum number of candidates a political 
party must field in general elections to one-fourth of the total 
number of House of Representatives seats. 
  -- To give House committees more power. 
  -- The leader of the largest opposition party be 
automatically named opposition leader. 
  -- To allow immediate consideration by the House of 
motions put forward as a matter of urgency. 
  -- To establish an administration court. 
  -- To reduce the number of senators to one-third of MPs. 
  "I am pleased that changes to the Constitution will be 
made," 
Chumphon said. 
  Chat Phatthana Party Secretary-General Prachuap Chaiyasan 
said it was possible to amend the eight points, but he could not 
give a guarantee. Yesterday's meeting had made progress, but 
whether the changes would be passed depended on a compromise. 
  Prachuap also asked the government to call a special House 
session to deliberate the amendments. Solidarity Party deputy 
leader Khanin Bunsuwan said changes to the charter were likely 
as a result of the meeting. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said earlier yesterday he was 
confident of changes to the Constitution, but not all the 25 
points. 
  "I think that the points which are agreed to (by the 
government and the opposition) could be changed. But it is 
difficult to amend all 25 points because of different opinions," 
he said. 
  The opposition parties on Tuesday resolved that all 25 
proposals should be included in a single bill. The government 
would prefer to initially amend six points. Each side has 
accused the other of insincerity in pushing for a more 
democratic constitution. 
  Chuan claimed that the suggestion to consider all amendments 
as a single bill had not been agreed to by all opposition 
members. He said all parties should cooperate on the amendments. 
  Chuan said separate bills would make the changes easier. If 
a bill failed to pass through the parliament, legislators could 
propose another bill, he said. 
  It would not hurt the government or the opposition if a 
particular amendment did not materialize. Both camps want 
changes for a better constitution. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasathian said it would 
be 
impossible to get agreement on making all 25 changes in one 
bill. His Phalang Tham Party had resolved to amend about five 
points of the charter, he said. 
  He said failure to amend the Constitution would affect 
Parliament's image, just the government's. Opposition Prachakon 
Thai leader Samak Suntharawet said the 25 points should be 
considered as separate bills.

  [Text] Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon has reshuffled 
his duties and those of his deputies taking personal charge of 
the Business Economics and Foreign Trade departments and the 
Public Warehouse Organisation. 
  Previously, the Business Economics Department -- which 
handles trade negotiations, research and data compilation-- was 
the responsibility of Deputy Minister Chaloemphon Sanitwongchai. 
  Mr Chaloemphon, who was appointed when Phaithun Kaeothong 
moved to become deputy labour minister, made no secret of the 
fact that he was not interested in the Business Economics 
Department, prefering an agency that has practical activities 
inside Thailand. 
  Mr Uthai has given him responsibility for the Insurance 
Department in a direct swap, dropping the Export Promotion 
Department and adding the Commercial Registration Department. 
  Deputy Minister Churin Laksanawisit is taking responsibility 
for the Export Promotion Department, relinquishing the 
Commercial Registration Department, while also retaining 
responsibility for the Intellectual Property Department. 
  Deputy Commerce Minister Chaiyot Sasomsap will take charge 
of 
the Internal Trade Department.

  [Text] The United States and Vietnam on Thurday began the 
first search mission this year for U.S. troops still listed as 
missing in action [MIA] from the Vietnam War. The first mission 
will involve 84 U.S. experts in the largest such mission since 
searches began in 1988. 
  The commander of the U.S. expert team, Major General Needham 
said that he was satisfied with the progress obtained during his 
mission in Vietnam. Mr. Needham did not believe that the 
Vietnamese Government still keeps the remains. 
  The commander-in-chief for the U.S. Asia-Pacific Command, 
Admiral Charles Larson will visit Vietnam from 16 to 19 January 
for discussions on MIA. Larson is scheduled to meet officials 
from the American Office of MIA in Hanoi as well as Vietnamese 
officials and the team of American experts searching for MIA in 
Southern Vietnam. 
  The next joint search operation between Americans and 
Vietnamese, which is to start today in Vietnam, will last three 
weeks. Other separate operation will begin in Laos on 12 
January. Moreover, four U.S. congressional delegations are 
expected in Vietnam through the end of January whose experts 
arrived in Hanoi on Saturday.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry held a new year international 
news conference this afternoon in Hanoi. Referring to our 1993 
foreign affairs activities, Mrs. Ho The Lan, spokeswoman of the 
Foreign Ministry, said the cooperative relations between Vietnam 
and other countries have been consolidated by another step 
through visits by Vietnamese party, state, and National Assembly 
leaders to countries in Asia and the Pacific, Europe, and Latin 
America, and the visits to Vietnam by many national leaders 
including the official visit by French President Francois 
Mitterrand. Relations between Vietnam and other countries have 
been upgraded and diplomatic relations have been established 
with 145 countries. 
  Vietnam has also made a breakthrough with some international 
financial organizations. It highly valued the efforts of France 
and other countries on the settlement of Vietnam's debts. 
  Regarding the Vietnam-U.S. relations, Mrs. Ho The Lan 
reviewed the breakthrough in ties. She also clarified Vietnam's 
clear and unchanged views on this issue. She said further 
developments will depend on the American side. 
  Our Foreign Ministry spokeswoman also informed that in 1994, 
especially in the first quarter, many national leaders and 
diplomatic and economic delegations will visit Vietnam.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan 4 -- The United Kingdom has pledged to 
extend an aid worth USD [U.S. dollars] 90 million to Vietnam. 
The UK is the second biggest donor after Japan at the recent 
Paris conference of Vietnam's donors, says a press release made 
available here today by the British Embassy. 
  Speaking to this event, British Ambassador to Vietnam Peter 
Williams remarked that the aid pledge shows his government's 
regard for the economic performance of the government and people 
of Vietnam together with the policies of economic renovation 
over the past few years. He stressed the excellent development 
of bilateral relations following the highly successful UK visit 
by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet last July. 
  "The substantial international assistance the Vietnam has 
enlisted in the recent donor conference for Vietnam can help the 
country move forward to further successes in the future," said 
the ambassador. It is known that UK is the second biggest donor 
after only Japan at the said Paris conference. 
  Peter Williams further said that the international 
community's strong support to Vietnam stems from their belief in 
the country's potential for economic development and their 
positive evaluation of the results of the Vietnamese 
Government's current economic reforms.

  [Text] With the approval of the governments of the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic, the Quang Tri Province People's Committee and the 
Savannakhet Province Administrative Committee held an official 
ceremony on the afternoon of 5 January 1994 to open the 
international Lao Bao-Ban Den Savan border gate. It is one of 
our country's international land border gates. Attending the 
grand opening ceremony were leading officials from the 
Vietnamese provinces of Quang Tri, Thua Thien-Hue, and Quang 
Nam-Da Nang, and Savannakhet Province in Laos. Also on hand was 
the acting Lao consul general in Da Nang. 
  The upgrade of the Lao Bao-Ban Den Savan border gate to an 
international border gate comes in response to the aspirations 
of the two peoples, especially the residents of Quang Tri and 
Savannkhet Provinces. This move will create many favorable 
conditions for communication along Highway 9. The new 
international border gate will also play an important role in 
promoting economic development based on the advantages of 
Highway 9.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 3 -- A number of transport projects 
[are] expected to be carried out in the coming years in service 
of economic development in Vietnam. At present Vietnam has 
105,000 km of high-way, 2,600 km of railway, seven main ports 
and three international airports and 10 domestic airports. But 
only 12 per cent of roads are surfaced with asphalt and only 
half of the 8,000 national bridges are permanent ones. 
  The country has seven railway lines of which the longest one 
is the Hanoi-Ho Chi Minh City line. This 1,726 km-transviet 
line, which was restored after the Vietnam war nearly 20 years 
ago, now needs to be upgraded to meet passengers' demand for 
time and services. More than 12,000 km of river routes are 
being used by means of transport but the river-port system is 
not well prepared. Ports at sea have a better prospect of 
modernization due to foreign investment. However at the moment 
there is not any port whose annual capacity of commodities 
delivered can reach 10 million tonnes. Vietnam's airports, 
especially Noi Bai, Tan Son Nhat and Danang airports have been 
upgraded to a considerable extent. But these airports need to 
be transformed and enlarged with an estimated outlay of USD 
[U.S. dollars] 300 million. So, from now to the year 2000, USD 
hundreds of billion must be invested in upgrading the transport 
system. While people are encouraged to contribute their 
manpower and part of the funds for the building and repairing of 
the local road network, the Vietnamese Government focus its 
financial resources and aid funds and the international 
cooperation on upgrading the national arteries. Highway No. 5 
which connects Hanoi to the port city of Haiphong is planned to 
be expanded to 20 metres with four lanes for vehicles. The work 
is the result of loans from Taiwan and Japan. A USD 250 million 
project to expand Highway No. 18 (linking Bac Ninh, Ha Bac 
Province to Quang Ninh) has been approved. In the south, the 
road linking Ho Chi Minh City with Vung Tau will be entirely 
rehabilitated. Saigon-Long Thanh Express Way together with a 
bridge lying across Dong Nai river will be completed in the year 
2000. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will 
provide fund totalling nearly USD 300 million for the 
restoration of 1A highway, the road from Hanoi-Vinh and from Ho 
Chi Minh City to Nha Trang. In addition the Governments of 
Japan, France, Australia and some international organizations 
will also fund additional loans for the repair and rebuilding of 
some bridges. According to the Ministry of Transport and 
Communications, in the coming time more than ten 100 metre-long 
bridges will be built with expenditure ranging from USD 5 
million to USD 100 million and four harbours will be upgraded so 
that they can accommodate vessels of more than 30,000 DWT.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 2 -- The government has issued a new 
ordinance permitting Vietnamese credit organisations to sell 
shares to foreign buyers. 
  The ordinance enclosed with Decision 228/QD-NH5 by the 
governor general of the Vietnam State Bank was signed to take 
effect from Dec. 2, 1993. 
  Under this document, the state bank will allow any 
Vietnamese 
commercial stock bank which has had more than one year of 
profitable operation [to] establish external banking relations, 
and the governor general of the state bank will allow any 
commercial stock bank which has a prescribed capital of 50 
billion VND [Vietnam dong] (5 million USD) or more to sell 
shares to foreign share-holders. Shares are payable by foreign 
share-holders with the US dollar or other convertible foreign 
currencies, but they must be converted into the Vietnamese dong 
at the buy rate announced by the state bank at the time they 
decide to buy shares. 
  These shares will bear the names of the foreign 
share-holders 
and register the value contributed on Vietnamese dong. 
  However, a legitimate foreign share-holder or his/her 
replacement is only allowed to hold at most 10 percent of the 
prescribed capital of a credit organisation, and the total 
share-holding of all foreigners in a credit organisation should 
not exceed 30 percent of its prescribed capital. Foreign 
share-holders can join the managing council in proportion to the 
value of the shares they hold, but they will not be allowed to 
become chairman of the managing council, and a foreign 
share-holder shall not take part simultaneously in the managing 
councils of two credit organizations. 
  After holding the shares for five years foreign shareholders 
are allowed to transfer their shares to others. The transfer 
abroad of the annual dividend or of the property left after a 
Vietnamese credit organisation is dissolved must be made in 
accordance with the Law on Foreign Investment in Vietnam and 
with Vietnam's regulations on the control of foreign currencies.

  [Text] Chang Chae-yong, director of the American Affairs 
Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, said that the third U.S.-North 
Korean high-level talks will be held after the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] ordinary [tongsang] inspection or 
the exchange of special envoys between the North and South are 
achieved. 
  Director Chang said on 6 January that during a telephone 
contact with the United States on 5 January, North Korea 
announced that it will hold contacts with the IAEA to discuss 
the beginning of the ordinary inspection. He said this is a 
process for the start of the third round of talks between the 
United States and North Korea in which the nuclear issue will be 
earnestly discussed. 
  A relevant government official also said that the move for 
the working-level contacts between the North and South will be 
active after North Korea and the IAEA discuss the nuclear 
inspections, and that the exchange of special envoys between the 
North and South is likely to be realized before the third round 
of U.S.-North Korean talks. 
  He said that as soon as the discussion between North Korea 
and the IAEA over the nuclear inspection is ended, the United 
States and North Korea will hold a working-level contact in New 
York and discuss the agenda for partial compromise [pubun 
takyelan], including the holding of the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean talks. He also said that the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean talks will be held in Geneva within the next 
month only if the present ongoing process of consultations are 
being carried out as scheduled.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 6 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
United States will have contacts to settle the details of their 
third round of high-level talks after Pyongyang finishes its 
consultations with the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), a government official here said Thursday [6 January]. 
The official said that he expected the contact to be held as 
early as next week. 
  When an IAEA inspection team enters North Korea, Pyongyang 
and Washington will probably announce a date for the third round 
of high-level talks, South and North Korea will have a 
working-level contact on exchanging special envoys, and Seoul 
will declare the suspension of its "Team Spirit" joint military 
exercise with the United States. 
  "North Korea and the IAEA are expected to begin 
consultations 
soon on the method and schedule for the IAEA inspection of North 
Korea's seven declared nuclear installations. After the 
consultation is over, North Korea and the United States will 
finally fix their agenda and schedule for the third round of 
talks," the official said. 
  "If Pyongyang and Washington agree on details in additional 
contacts in New York and smoothly push ahead with preparations, 
then the third round of talks will be held. They will have 
full-fledged discussion on resolution of the North Korean 
nuclear problem." 
  Consultation between North Korea and the IAEA is not 
directly 
leading to solution of the North Korean nuclear problem, but it 
is preparation for a third round of talks to solve the problem, 
he added. 
  North Korea's willingness to consult with the IAEA is 
progress, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 6 (YONHAP) -- Yi Su-chong, 40, who is 
wanted on suspicion of embezzling money in South Korea and using 
it to open a boutique in New York, has been deported from the 
United States. Korean police said that Yi will be arrested on 
charges of fraud and violation of the bad check control law upon 
his arrival at Kimpo International Airport at 4:35 PM Thursday 
[6 January] aboard Korean Air flight 025. 
  In June 1991, Yi fled to the United States after he came 
under suspicion of swindling 870 million won (1.08 million U.S. 
dollars) out of several people by dishonoring checks. He was 
arrested by the U.S. Immigration Service in June last year after 
the Korean Government nullified his passport and was sentenced 
to deportation by a U.S. court. 
  Last year, police persuaded 12 fugitives overseas to return 
to the country.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials and articles from ROK vernacular newspapers published 
on 3 and 4 January on DPRK President Kim Il-song's New Year's 
address delivered on 31 December 1993 at the Kumsusan Assembly 
Hall in Pyongyang. 
  The moderate Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO in Korean on 3 January 
publishes on page 3 a 700-word editorial on Kim Il-song's New 
Year's address titled "The North's New Year's Address, Which 
Fails To Mention North-South Dialogue." Elaborating on the 
characteristics of Kim's address, the editorial notes that the 
address was nothing different from the previous addresses and 
that no mention was made in it regarding the North-South 
dialogue. The editorial concludes that while stressing the need 
for holding dialogue with the United States, Kim Il-song is not 
interested in holding the North-South dialogue. 
  The editorial reports that Kim Il-song's remarks denouncing 
the civilian-led Government of South Korea indicates Kim is not 
interested in holding a dialogue with our government. Expressing 
disappointment over the address, the editorial concludes: 
"Judging by North Korea's attitude and President Kim's New Year 
address it is most likely that North Korea will utilize 
North-South dialogue as a means for dialogue with the United 
States. Therefore, we should renounce our optimistic view that 
we can improve North-South relations under circumstances 
favorable for us and should seriously grasp North Korea's 
intent. Thus, we should take countermeasures against it." 
  The conservative Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean on 4 January 
publishes on page 2 a 700-word article by An Hui-chang 
commenting on Kim Il-song's address. The article notes that 
Kim's address revealed North Korea's intent "to recover from its 
backward economic situation and to improve relations with the 
United States and other Western countries." Noting the strongly 
worded denunciation of the South Korean government in the 
address, the article reports that the address "has cast 
pessimistic prospects on improving `bona fide' North-South 
relations." 
  Elaborating on North Korea's new economic policies indicated 
in the address, including the development of external trade and 
the increase in production of export goods, the article reports 
this reveals North Korea's intent to make a partial opening 
within the framework of maintaining its self-reliant economy in 
a bid to overcome its present economic difficulties. 
  Noting Kim's remarks on building up its defense capability, 
the North Korean nuclear issue, and the improvement of relations 
with the United States and Japan the article predicts that this 
year, too, North Korea will continue to use its nuclear card for 
various purposes, such as in maintaining its political system 
and enhancing its position in the international arena. 
  The article concludes: Kim's address "has revealed an intent 
to follow the basic line North Korea has taken so far and, 
accordingly, North-South relations, as well, are expected to 
repeat a `tedious war of nerves'." 
  The moderate Seoul HANGUK ILBO in Korean on 4 January 
publishes on page 3 a 800-word editorial on Kim Il-song's New 
Year address titled "Substantial North-South Dialogue Is a Key 
Factor." The editorial notes Kim's address offered nothing new 
and nothing different from his previous new year addresses and 
that it was a "long-winded talk" to stress communist ideology 
and motivate the North Korean people to work harder. 
  The editorial summarizes the address into five points: 1. 
The Third Seven-Year Plan, which ended in failure; 2. The 
North Korean Workers' Party plenary meeting's designation of the 
next three years as a readjustment period in which North Korea 
will reportedly place emphasis on agriculture, light industry, 
and external trade; 3. The strongly worded denunciation of the 
civilian-led South Korean Government; 4. The provocative 
remarks on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, which are 
aimed implicitly at the United States; and 5. The reunification 
policy. The editorial stresses Kim's address is basically 
similar in content to previous years' addresses, though 
expressions and phrases used are different to some extent. 
Noting ongoing U.S.-North Korean contacts and anticipated 
improvement in relations between the United States and North 
Korea and between Japan and North Korea, the editorial stresses 
that "the utmost task facing us this year is how to realize `de 
facto dialogue' between North and South Korea for human and 
material exchanges and cooperation, which depends on Kim 
Yong-sam government's policy toward North Korea." 
  Seoul HUNGUK ILBO in Korean on 4 January publishes on page 4 
an 800-word article by Yu Sung-u commenting on Kim Il-song's New 
Year address. The editorial cites key points of the address and 
elaborates on their background and implication. The article then 
notes that the address "is characterized by the revelation of 
North Korea's strong intent to concentrate greater efforts on 
recovering from its difficult economic situation and, at the 
same time, to improve relations with the United States and other 
Western countries." 
  The pro-government Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean on 4 
January carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "We Are 
Disappointed in Kim Il-song's New Year Address." The editorial 
begins: "We expected North Korea to try to explore a new 
breakthrough this year to overcome the difficult problems it is 
facing, such as international isolation and economic failure." 
The editorial then notes, "Kim Il-song's New Year address, 
however, proved that Kim Il-song's objective of maintaining the 
anachronistic system called `our-style socialism' remains 
unchanged." The editorial continues: "Stressing that the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should be resolved through 
U.S.-North Korean talks, Kim Il-song did not show any interest 
in inter-Korean dialogue. This reveals that North Korea is 
trying to press forward for the establishment of diplomatic 
relations with the United States, using the nuclear issue as a 
negotiating card, but that it is not interested in improving 
inter-Korean relations." The editorial concludes: 
"Inter-Korean relations, as well as the nuclear issue, should 
be resolved through dialogue between the parties concerned of 
the North and the South. North Korea should not disappoint us 
and the world anymore." 
  The pro-government Seoul SEOUL SINMUN in Korean on 4 January 
carries on page 6 a 600-word article by Ku Pon-yong entitled: 
"The Meaning of Kim Il-song's New Year Address Regards Improving 
Relations With the United States as a Matter of Vital Interest 
for the Survival of the North's System." The article notes that 
judging from Kim Il-song's New Year address, the North Korean 
foreign and domestic policy will concentrate on resolving its 
economic problems, and reports: "Kim Il-song declares in his 
New Year address that North Korea will develop `good-neighborly 
relations' with capitalist countries as well, thus hinting that 
North Korea will pursue practical economic interest through 
improvement of relations with the United States and Japan. Kim 
Il-song insisted that the nuclear issue be resolved through 
negotiations with the United States. This eloquently manifests 
that North Korea regards the improvement of relations with the 
United States as a necessity of vital interest for the survival 
of its system." The article then notes: "It is noteworthy that 
Kim Il-song mentioned nothing about the inter-Korean dialogue in 
his New Year's address. This reveals the North Korean scheme to 
carry on dialogue only with the United States, bypassing us. 
Nevertheless, the government authorities are of the opinion 
that the context of Kim's New Year's address does not 
necessarily mean that the inter-Korean relations will continue 
to remain in a stalemate in the New Year as well." The article 
then cites the remark by Song Yong-tae, vice unification 
minister, "The North Korean attitude toward inter-Korean 
dialogue will change depending upon the progress of the 
U.S.-North Korean unofficial contacts in New York." 
  The left-leaning Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean on 4 
January 
carries on page 3 an 800-word editorial entitled "President 
Kim's New Year Address and Inter-Korean Relations." The 
editorial notes Kim Il-song's New Year address gave the 
impression that the North Korean nuclear issue, which showed 
signs of a breakthrough, might turn, though temporarily, into a 
complication. The editorial notes the reason for this is that 
the New Year address did not mention the inter-Korean dialogue, 
but severely criticized the South Korean Government. The 
editorial then reports: "We are curious to know how the 
government, particularly President Kim Yong-sam, will react to 
this. During a meeting conveying New Year greetings on 3 
January, President Kim stated: `Since the North Korean nuclear 
issue is directly connected with our nation's existence, we 
should resolve it early this year without fail.' We feel both 
expectations and worries about the fact that President Kim 
Yong-sam set `early this year' as a deadline for the resolution 
of the nuclear issue." The editorial then adds: "We hope 
President Kim Yong-sam's deadline of `early this year' for the 
resolution of the nuclear issue will not be a signal of a 
hard-line offensive toward North Korea." 
  The left-leaning Seoul HANGYORE SINMUN in Korean on 4 
January 
carries on page 3 a 700-word article by Kang Tae-ho entitled 
"What President Kim's New Year Address Signifies: Negative on 
Inter-Korean Dialogue, Stresses Resolution of Nuclear Issue 
Through North Korean-U.S. Talks, Details Trade Issue, Stresses 
Acceleration of Economic Construction." 
  The article notes: "President Kim Il-song's New Year 
address, 
in short, regards the Kim Yong-sam government as nothing 
different from the preceding military regimes. This is in 
contrast with his expectations of the Kim Yong-sam government 
expressed in his 1993 New Year address. This negative view of 
North Korea toward inter-Korean dialogue was culminated during 
the ROK-U.S. summit talks held last November. North Korea 
thinks the South is laying an `artificial obstacle' to the North 
Korean-U.S. talks, which are heading toward the resolution of 
the nuclear issue." The article then notes that the New Year 
address placed greatest emphasis on the economy, economic 
construction, agriculture, light industry, and particularly 
trade. The article concludes by citing the view of North Korean 
experts, who find it unusual for the New Year's address to place 
so much emphasis on trade and exports in so much detail. 
  The moderate Seoul KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean on 4 January 
carries on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "Let Us Clear Up 
Uncertainty." After elaborating on the dim North-South 
relations caused by North Korea's closed-door policy against the 
trends of the world, the editorial notes: "North Korea, which 
claimed that the issues concerning the North and the South 
should be resolved by the parties concerned, assumes the 
attitude to hold negotiations with the United States over the 
issues concerning the Korean peninsula. This clearly shows 
North Korea's double-dealing attitude." Referring to North 
Korea's nuclear issue, the editorial notes: "We should not have 
hasty expectations and excessive pessimism about the issues 
concerning the North and the South. To settle the nuclear 
negotiations, measures should be taken to resume the essential 
North-South dialogue." Referring to the North Korean- U.S. 
negotiations, the editorial reports: "The United States and 
North Korea have focused their negotiations on the international 
inspection team's entry into the North, thus ignoring the issue 
of developing a method to effectively inspect North Korea's 
nuclear facilities." The editorial then stresses that "under 
such circumstances, if the United States unilaterally announces 
the discontinuation of the Team Spirit exercise and the 
scheduling of the third round of the North Korean-U.S. 
high-level talks, this will result in ignoring the essence of 
removing suspicions about North Korea's nuclear development. 
Our repeated demand is that it be a prerequisite to ensure 
North Korea's nuclear transparency." 
  The editorial notes: "Even though the United States and 
North 
Korea have agreed upon a principle, it is not desirable to 
assume an excessive optimistic attitude toward overall 
North-South relations. Kim Il-song strongly denounced the 
civilian government in his New Year address. This clearly shows 
that North Korea has still not changed. Worse still, Kim 
Il-song repeatedly revealed the attitude that the nuclear issue 
should be resolved through negotiations with the United States 
and that reunification should be achieved by means of a 
confederation. This is the attitude that shows North Korea has 
obtained almost everything through negotiations with the United 
States." The editorial concludes: "If North Korea adheres to a 
line of isolation, it is impossible for North Korea to exist. 
The world will not sit back and watch North Korea go against 
peace and the trends of the times. North Korea should become a 
member of the international community and participate in the 
North-South dialogue and exchange by ensuring its nuclear 
transparency." 
  The moderate Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean on 4 January 
carries 
on page 3 a 900-word editorial entitled "The Difference in Views 
Between the Two Heads of the North and the South" and notes the 
desire of the people to solve North Korea's nuclear issue and to 
improve North-South relations. After comparing the new year 
addresses of President Kim Yong-sam and President Kim Il-song, 
the editorial quotes President Kim Yong-sam as stressing that: 
"Resolving North Korea's nuclear issue early this year is an 
absolute and vital task" and President Kim Il-song as saying: 
"The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be resolved 
through DPRK-U.S. talks" and "The South Korean civilian regime 
is only so in appearance and is actually not different from the 
preceding military dictatorial regime." After noting North 
Korea's silence about the North-South dialogue, the editorial 
notes: "North Korea should decide on its position toward the 
North-South dialogue." The editorial then raises questions 
about the government's position toward the solution of North 
Korea's nuclear issue and the issue of exchange of special 
envoys. The editorial concludes by reporting that North Korea 
is full of distrust of South Korea. 
  The moderate Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean on 4 January 
carries 
on page 4 a 1,400-word article by Pak Che-kyun entitled "The 
Meaning Contained in Kim Il-song's New Year Address." The 
article notes that "in his New Year address, President Kim 
Il-song strongly emphasized improving relations with the United 
States and on strengthening friendship and cooperation with 
Western countries, including Japan." After noting that 
President Kim Il-song stressed that North Korea's nuclear issue 
should be resolved through talks with the United States, the 
article notes: "This is the first time President Kim himself 
stressed the nuclear negotiations with the United States. This 
proves that North Korea puts great efforts into improving 
relations with the United States." Referring to economic 
development, the article notes that Kim Il-song admitted great 
difficulties and obstacles in economic construction and 
mentioned agriculture-first, light industry-first, and 
trade-first policies. After elaborating on Kim Il-song 
emphasizing strengthening military power, the article notes: 
"Experts view Kim Il-song's emphasis on military power as 
consolidating its inner system, which may easily slacken as a 
result of opening up and economic development." After noting 
that Kim Il-song strongly denounced South Korea and placed the 
responsibility for failure of exchange of special envoys on the 
South side, the article comments: "It is expected that North 
Korea will attach importance to nongovernmental dialogue led by 
experts of South Korean affairs, including Vice President Kim 
Yong-chu, rather than dialogue between the authorities."

<F P=106> [Opening remarks to a "New Year News Conference" by </F>
President Kim Yong-sam for foreign and domestic reporters at the 
Chongwadae presidential offices, Seoul--live] 
  [Text] I am glad to meet you, especially you foreign and 
domestic reporters. 
  Dear fellow countrymen: I hope that during the New Year of 
1994 all your wishes are fulfilled and you enjoy happiness. 
Last year, we inaugurated the new government and initiated 
changes and reforms to create a new Korea. With the 
inauguration of the civilian government and reform, our 
country's international position has been amazingly enhanced. 
The world is watching us. Indeed, our society has been changed 
remarkably over the past year. I sincerely thank you, the 
people, for joining in the changes and reform. 
  This is the second year of change and reform. It is the year 
to pledge a new upsurge and consolidate last year's achievements. 
  The Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations, which have dragged on 
for seven years, were settled late last year. Thus, the world 
has entered an era of unlimited competition. The world and 
international competition are no longer empty words, but rather 
a reality. We must exchange our narrow vision for a wide vision 
of the entire world. Only the nations that win the competition 
will become the masters of global history. The nations left 
behind in the competition will barely survive. 
  It is our task this year to determine how to cope with the 
fierce flow of world history. I want the new year's goal of the 
state administration to be to strengthen the nation's 
competitiveness. While setting this goal, I would like to 
discuss the direction of overall state affairs. 
  First, I will continuously push for change and reform in a 
bid to enhance the country's competitiveness. Through reform, 
we should advance in the world and through change, we must 
prepare for the future. 
  The world has entered an era of competition through reform. 
We must adjust laws and regulations so that there will be 
innovations in efficiency and productivity in all domains of 
state affairs. We must continue to eliminate authoritarianism, 
corruption, and irregularities that block internationalization 
and slow our advance to the future. 
  In order to adapt to the changed international order, we 
must first change all the government's functions and roles. The 
government itself should take the initiative in eliminating and 
rectifying inefficient practices. The government should 
strongly push ahead with ongoing reforms and change so that the 
people can actually feel them in their routine lives. The 
government should become a government that always contributes to 
alleviating the people's inconvenience and that serves for the 
welfare of alienated people. 
  Change should also be effected in politics. In today's 
turning point of the state and society, those involved in 
politics should display the leadership of pooling the strength 
and wisdom of the people. Now is the time to do so. With the 
form of politics we had in the past we could not succeed in the 
era of unlimited competition. Without changing our policies we 
cannot enhance the international competitiveness of our country. 
  The people ardently want to see the politicians adapt to the 
changing world and sincerely discuss matters to cope with it. 
Today we urgently need such policies with which to lead 
communities and provide guidance in carrying out change and 
reform. Policies in the interest of the people and for their 
welfare are urgently required. 
  We need policies that alleviate the sufferings of the people 
in all fields, including education, traffic, environment, and 
public security. The creation of such a political climate in 
which confrontation and competition are vigorously carried out 
is desirable. Policies that foster collective egoism should be 
eliminated. Political reform by the politicians themselves 
should precede all other reforms. We should firmly establish 
clean politics. I expect the bills on political reform to pass 
soon. 
  I will strengthen our economy's international 
competitiveness 
through the steady promotion of the Five Year-Plan of the new 
economy. The expansion of social overhead capital and 
facilities, the balanced development of national land, the 
alleviation of regulations imposed on economic activities, and 
the development of science and technology are our priority task 
to strengthen international competitiveness. Our economy faces 
difficulties today. 
  The government will further accelerate the expansion of 
social overhead facilities to strengthen our potential for 
economic growth. For this, I will provide mechanisms so that 
civilian capital is actively induced into social overhead 
facilities. At the same time, I will epochally rectify 
imbalances in regional development. This is my long-cherished 
will and resolution. I will provide a breakthrough and 
foundation for rectifying imbalances between regions during my 
term of office without fail. 
  I have already directed the new economic team to provide 
comprehensive measures and implementation plans so this work 
will be initiated on a full scale beginning this year. The new 
economic team will make public to the people the framework of 
these projects in the near future. Only when free and fair 
competition is carried out, can sound enterprises be fostered. 
  Since unnecessary restrictions may work as a cause for 
corruption, I will abolish, as part of my reform drive, 
regulations that restrict business activities. The government 
has already formed a team, which has already begun activities, 
for examining ways to relax restrictive regulations. We will 
drastically restructure more than half of the 
government-supported enterprises, which have been operated 
loosely or for which the nation's management is considered no 
longer necessary, so that they are integrated, dissolved, or 
privatized. 
  We cannot enhance international competitiveness of our 
economy without technological development. In the new year, we 
will push ahead with bolder policies for the promotion of 
science and technology. 
  We must develop ultramodern industrial technology, including 
introducing precision new materials and developing the life 
sciences. At the same time, we must effect innovations in each 
existing technology in our industrial fields. We will increase 
the investment in and intensify support of technological 
development to foster the intelligence industry. 
  With a view to creating a climate for vigorous business 
activities, we will make efforts to stabilize wages and to lower 
monetary interest and land prices. For this, we will readjust 
laws and regulations pertaining to land and will further expand 
the opening of the door for inducement of foreign capital, 
including commercial loans for social overhead capital and 
facilities. 
  At the same time, we must thoroughly comprehend and cope 
with 
the changes of the time. For example, the environment issue is 
not only our nation's problem. We must prepare ourselves now to 
effectively cope with the forthcoming environmental discussions. 
  I will direct all efforts to work out measures to deal with 
the problems of farmers and fishermen, who are in a difficult 
situation due to the opening of agricultural markets, and on 
agriculture and fisheries. Our agriculture, fisheries, farms, 
and fishing villages are facing a great turning point as the 
result of the settlement of the UR negotiations last year. 
  The shock and frustration of farmers and fishermen was 
painful to all of us, but also to me. However, we should 
surmount today's difficulties. We can surmount them. We should 
make a new start with new methods for this. As was promised, 
the government will complete the 42 trillion won-scale farm and 
fishing village development project three years ahead of 
schedule. I will see to it that this project is carried out 
according to the local situation. 
  A special tax will be established by this year to strengthen 
the competitiveness of agricultural and fishing products. 
Through this special tax the government will set aside 1.5 
trillion won every year to invest in farm and fishing villages 
for the next 10 years. 
  I have established a secretarial position in the 
presidential 
offices for agriculture and fisheries in an effort to 
effectively promote agricultural policies. Soon, I will also 
form a farm and fishing village development committee which will 
be a presidential advisory organ. I will establish within the 
first half of this year practical and fundamental measures to 
secure the international competitiveness of our agricultural 
products and to effect innovations in the development of the 
rural environment. I will directly preside over the meeting of 
the farm and fishing village development committee which 
agriculture-related ministries will attend. Thus, I will 
directly oversee the smooth promotion of various agricultural 
policies. I will see to it that all of our people pool their 
wisdom and strength so as to protect and revive farm and fishing 
villages. 
  Fourth, I will actively promote educational reform to 
enhance 
our international competitiveness. Our country's international 
competitiveness is determined, in the end, by people. Along 
with education of people, our education should foster talented 
individuals who will be able to cope with globalization and 
opening up. Educational reform will be the core of the reforms 
and changes we seek. 
  The government will strengthen professional and 
technological 
education to deepen education in science and to supply able 
human resources to the industrial and administrative sectors. 
The education reform committee which will soon be formed under 
direct presidential authority, will provide a comprehensive 
education reform plan, and I will see to it that the education 
reform plan is implemented consistently. 
  We should make our 5,000-year-long culture the foundation of 
our national strength. The spirit of being devoted to people's 
welfare is the foundation of our national culture. Believing 
the characteristics of our national culture to be the 
characteristics of world culture, we should foster and cultivate 
our culture. 
  This year marks the 600th anniversary of the selection of 
Seoul as the capital. This year also is Visit Korea Year, and 
the year of Korean traditional music. I expect that vigorous 
efforts will be made this year to make our art internationally 
renowned. 
  Fifth, I will carry out bold policies to internationalize 
and 
globalize all of our society. We will pursue active opening, 
not passive globalization. This is because we ourselves must 
cultivate our own national destiny, which must not be determined 
by other people. 
  The degree of the globalization of a country, as well as its 
economic and military strengths and the level of its culture, 
are important factors in determining its national strength. 
Globalization means deregulation, opening up, and 
rationalization [jayulhwa, kaebanghwa, hamnihwa]. To promote 
cooperation and compete with the world fairly, we must globalize 
the people's consciousness and their capabilities as well as our 
systems. Globalization must be pursued both in the central 
government and in the regional governments. I expect practical 
reforms for globalization will be made in all fields of our 
society. 
  Practical diplomacy [silli oegyo] is called for more 
urgently 
than ever in an era of globalization. Heads of state of various 
countries are busy promoting their own national interests. I 
will rush to any place in the world if it is beneficial to the 
country and people. And, the government will prudently fulfill 
its duties to promote peace in the world and prosperity in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  We will strengthen diplomacy in economic affairs and trade 
to 
positively adjust ourselves to [chokkuk taeung] the 
international trade environment, which has changed since the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations. 
  Sixth, this year, I will do my best to build a foundation 
for 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and improving 
South-North relations. 
  The North Korean nuclear issue is an issue over which the 
existence of 70 million fellow countrymen is at stake. It also 
constitutes a threat to peace in the world. 
  North Korea must, though belatedly, come forward with the 
correct attitude of trying to resolve the Korean peninsula 
problems through South-North Korean dialogue. I hope North 
Korea will realize that it is a correct way to get assistance 
for what it needs within the nation through South-North 
dialogue, instead of trying to get it from outside. If the 
North Korean nuclear issue is resolved, substantial relations 
between the South and North can be promoted at a very rapid 
speed. 
  Fortunately, North Korea shows signs of change, and I expect 
we will be able to find clues to resolving the issue in a few 
days [kummyonggan]. 
  Of course we should refrain from being too hastily 
optimistic. However, North Korea's closed and isolation policy, 
rather than helping it maintain its system, will only burden it. 
I clearly believe that North Korea will gradually become aware 
of this fact. This is because as the era of unlimited 
competition emerges, North Korea will have to take part in 
globalization to survive. The sooner North Korea takes part in 
the trend of reform and openness, the more it will hasten our 
whole nation's globalization. 
  As president, I will carry out my work so that not an inch 
of 
error in national security emerges. I will continuously promote 
reform and modernization of our military to assume a posture of 
security so as to prevent any kind of provocation. 
  While there can be no sanctuary in eradicating injustice and 
corruption, the people's love and faith in the military must not 
be shaken. I hope all the people will encourage the military's 
rebirth. I would like to thank our officers and men who are 
taking pains to defend the armistice line in this cold winter. 
  Dear fellow countrymen: I would like to ask exceptional 
cooperation from you, the people, as I reveal my plan for 
administrating state affairs this year. 
  First of all, I would like to address businessmen. The most 
important force of competition in an era of globalization and 
internationalization is the business sector. The government 
will provide all the assistance necessary to make our country 
the most appropriate country for business. When this is carried 
out, businessmen must exert efforts for invest resolutely and 
develop technology and markets. 
  Economic war is competition in quality. I hope that 
businessmen make products under the goal of making the world's 
highest quality products. 
  Lacking harmony between the labor and management, there can 
be no competitiveness. As today's economic growth was achieved 
though the sweat of workers, tomorrow's international 
competitiveness will be impossible without the determination and 
participation of workers. Labor and management must harmonize so 
that the economy can be saved, and the economy must be alive for 
there to be a share for you and me. I would like to propose 
that labor and management make this year a year of no 
labor-management disputes. 
  The government will also prepare to carry out, without 
fail, an employment insurance system in 1995. Once again, I 
sincerely appeal to you, farmers and fishermen, not to be 
discouraged. We must concentrate all our wisdom on overcoming 
the high wave of global competitiveness and openness from now on 
and make efforts for its realization. We must make efforts to 
adapt ourselves to the new circumstances. Also, organizations 
of farmers and fishermen must start anew. 
  I address the 900,000 civil servants. Last year, many civil 
servants disclosed details of their assets to the public for the 
first time in history. This served as an important occasion for 
regaining the people's trust in your reputation. You are the 
master of change and reform, as well as the driving forces of 
international competitiveness. The fate of the state depends 
upon your awareness and efforts. I hope you discard an 
easy-going attitude and stand at the forefront of change and 
reform. 
  Also, I extend my appreciation and sympathy to you and your 
family members who shared the pain of last year's pay freeze. I 
will surely keep my word to raise the wages of the civil 
servants to the level of employees at government-operated 
corporates before 1997 by formulating a four-year plan for the 
improvement of the civil servant wage system. 
  I address my fellow countrymen. As we are only several years 
away from the 21st century, the coming years are the most 
important period for our nation. What we need now is faith to 
carry out changes and reform, and conviction for their certain 
success. The people's moral awareness and sense of mission in 
these times are the basic factors in overcoming 
internationalization and openness. 
  We must advance while carrying out reform. Also, we must 
carry out reform while advancing. It is our goal to achieve 
national reunification and to lead the creation of a new 
civilization in the Asia-Pacific era by entering the ranks of 
developed countries. We will surely reach it. Let's cherish 
the firm faith of opening a great era for the Korean nation. 
Let's all advance together toward that glorious day. 
  Finally, the United Nations has named this year the year of 
the family. Therefore, we should realize the importance of 
family and fill all our families with love and happiness by 
further developing our good family system. Thank you.

<F P=106> ["News Conference" held by President Kim Yong-sam with </F>
foreign and domestic reporters at the Chongwadae presidential 
offices in Seoul -- live] 
  [Text] [President Kim] Now I am pleased to receive 
questions from you reporters. 
  [Choe Kyu-sik, HANGUK ILBO reporter] I have learned that 
during recent negotiations with the United States, North Korea 
said that it would only accept one inspection of its seven 
nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA]. Can you clearly explain what actual progress has been 
made in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and whether we 
conceded to the North on our side's earlier demands for 
North-South mutual nuclear inspections? 
  [President Kim] Concerning the North Korean nuclear issue at 
this point, I would like to clearly state that the issue of the 
ROK's security and North Korea's nuclear issue were discussed 
intensively last July with U.S. President Clinton. In 
particular, they were discussed in depth during last November's 
summit, and the two nations have reached complete agreement on 
these issues. 
  Since that time, 24-hour-long contacts, including telephone 
calls with President Clinton to discuss problems, have been 
constantly maintained throughout ongoing negotiations between 
North Korea and the United States. Even before the United 
States began dialogue with North Korea, it exchanged views with 
the ROK, and it has kept us informed of results since the 
dialogue began. I especially want to clarify at this point the 
fact that the United States is completely respecting ROK will. 
  You mentioned a one-time nuclear inspection. The issue of 
nuclear inspections is not an issue between the United States 
and North Korea but a matter of discussion between the IAEA and 
North Korea. Because of the delicacy of this issue, I will 
refrain from providing further details such as what issues were 
discussed between the two sides. The only thing I can tell you 
is that discussions will be held in Vienna between a North 
Korean ambassador and the IAEA. Negotiations have yet to begin, 
however, as the North Korean side claims that it has yet to 
receive precise directives. 
  In conclusion, the ROK and the United States are in 
agreement 
that ultimately, mutual inspections between the North and the 
South should be conducted. I believe that these inspections 
will be realized without fail. 
  You reporters talk as though North-South dialogue has been 
ignored. This is not true. I want you, reporters, to know that 
the United States and the ROK agree that inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and the North-South 
dialogue must take place simultaneously, without fail. 
  [Kim Hong, KBS reporter] In recent contacts between the 
United States and North Korea, the North Korean side put forward 
a package deal proposal. People are under the impression that 
the United States was dragged into the North Korean side's plan 
to settle the nuclear problem, establishment of diplomatic 
relations between the United States and North Korea, and the 
issue of the Team Spirit exercise in a package deal. 
  Could you explain the government's position on the issue of 
the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea 
and the United States and between North Korea and Japan? 
  [President Kim] The package deal solution phrase was not 
used by the United States, but by the North Korean side. 
  As for the issue of Team Spirit, it is very sensitive, so I 
will refrain from talking on this issue at this time. While I 
will not elaborate on this issue as negotiations are ongoing, I 
would like to clearly state that by all means, this is an issue 
that the ROK will decide. 
  North Korea's establishment of diplomatic relations with the 
United States and Japan was agreed upon between the ROK and the 
United States in discussions with President Clinton last 
November. Since there is plenty of time, and establishment of 
diplomatic relations is not an issue that should be hastily 
discussed, I think we had better not discuss this issue in 
detail here. 
  [Cho Chong-min, MBC reporter] Let me continue the 
question. My question is about North-South relations. I 
remember it was on 27 December last year. During lunch with 
reporters that day, you said that North-South relations would 
improve considerably this year [1994]. However, North Korea's 
President Kim Il-song did not mention North-South relations in 
his New Year's address. Moreover, North Korea's denunciation of 
our government and president has increased recently. What are 
your prospects for North-South relations, including North-South 
summit talks? Do you see any likelihood for actual progress in 
North-South relations this year? 
  [President Kim] You should know that North Korea is not 
always consistent in what it says. North Korea said previously 
that it would never contact the United States and called for the 
withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea. Nevertheless, North 
Korea is now holding dialogue with the United States. North 
Korea tends never to announce anything that may be detrimental 
to it. For instance, as you know, when announcing the results 
of U.S.-North Korean negotiations, North Korea deleted many 
portions and did not mention North-South relations. If you knew 
these facts, you would know not to accept everything North Korea 
says at face value. 
  Regarding North-South summit talks, however, I think it is 
necessary for us to abort our past way of thinking. In other 
words, I want to stress that we should not hold summit talks 
with North Korea only for the sake of holding summit talks. I 
have held summit talks on numerous occasions with foreign heads 
of state. Last year alone, I held summit talks with leaders of 
foreign countries on 20 occasions. So there is no reason for me 
not to be able to hold summit talks with North Korea's President 
Kim Il-song. In order to hold summit talks, however, some 
problems should be solved. Let me repeat again that I will not 
hold summit talks only to hold summit talks. In the past, 
people thought that summit talks would solve everything. You 
are aware of the problems that we have pointed out. I will not 
make concessions on these issues for summit talks with North 
Korea. 
  [Yun Chang-chun, SEGYE ILBO reporter] When you reshuffled 
the cabinet and major positions in the ruling party last year, 
some people criticized your choice of so many of your close 
confidants. Former Minister of Political Affairs Kim Tok-yong, 
one of your close confidants, has stepped down and has no 
official post now. What is your opinion on the assessment of 
former Minister for Political Affairs Kim Tok-yong by political 
circles? Also, what do you say to criticism that you have 
chosen many close confidants? 
  [President Kim] That's a tough question. [laughs] The 
criteria I used in the reshuffle of personnel were the person's 
will to achieve reforms, clean and honest character, and 
ability. No matter how able one may be, one should be clean and 
honest and diligent. Ability is not everything. When one has 
the firm will to serve the country and the nation, one can 
demonstrate one's ability. Of course, some of the appointees to 
cabinet and party posts shared arduous and protracted political 
lives with me as part of the opposition. However, I am well 
aware of their character and ability. I have chosen them 
because I believe that they are exceedingly able to work hard, 
have the firm will for reforms, and have a clean and honest 
character. Regarding your question about Assemblyman Kim 
Tok-yong, I have been in contact with and known him for over 25 
years. We were together in extremely arduous times. There is no 
change in my affection for him. 
  Lawmaker Kim Tok-yong held the position of minister of 
state for political affairs. However, I believe that it will be 
good for him to rest for a while. Also, I believe that from 
various aspects, he will be able to sufficiently carry out the 
role of executive member of our Democratic Liberal Party [DLP]. 
I believe this will be of help to him. There is no change in 
my affection for him. 
  [Song Yong-on, TONG-A ILBO reporter] Mr. President, you have 
stated that Seoul will not be divided for the upcoming election 
of heads of regional administrative offices. However, I believe 
that problems remain in relegating the central government's 
direct control over special cities to provinces, dividing 
Kyonggi Province, and integrating cities and counties. What is 
your position on this? 
  [President Kim] I asked that since an election will be held 
one and a half years from now, we avoid talking about this issue 
if possible. I would like to point out that I don't feel any 
need to talk about this matter now. As I said in response to 
your questions on many previous occasions, I will walk the right 
path. We do not have to think that elections will be carried 
out by dividing regions. Elections will be carried out in a 
fair way. 
  [Kim Song-su, YONHAP reporter] There is still time before 
the DLP's national convention which is slated for May. 
Following the reorganization of the party's administration, the 
leadership system now centers around Executive Chairman Kim 
Chong-pil. Will there be any change in this leadership system 
before May? Can you give us your view on this matter? 
  [President Kim] Contrary to newpaper reports, I have not 
commented on this matter to date. Ten months have passed since 
the inauguration of the civilian-led government. Of my five 
years in office, this year will be the only one without 
elections. Thus, this is the year when various work must be 
conducted to resolve difficult issues. We must revive the 
economy, structurally improve and save the farms, and win in 
world competition. 
  As you all know, I have been a politician for a long time. A 
lot of money and manpower must be spent in order to hold a 
national party convention or meeting to reorganize district 
party chapters. The United States, one of the advanced countries 
and the world's most powerful country, holds a national party 
convention every four years when it designates a presidential 
candidate. 
  Slated for May, our DLP national convention is convened by 
the party president. So, if necessary, the president has the 
right to ask the standing committee to change the timing of the 
national party convention. If the standing committee adopts 
this request, the national party convention may not be held. 
  If the national party convention is to be held in May, the 
district party chapter must be reorganized in February, the 
provincial party convention must be held in March, and the 
national party convention must be held in May. Tens of 
thousands of people have to be gathered together. Is there a 
real need to hold such a political event this year? I believe 
that we should consider this matter deeply for our nation's 
future. 
  If we hold a national party convention, we will have to once 
again reshuffle the executive members of the party who were 
appointed just a few days ago. Do you think it is appropriate 
to reorganize important party positions in under four months? 
  I do not think this is possible. I think that Executive 
Chairman Kim Chong-pil, in assuming actual power, has managed 
the party well so far. I hope Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil 
will assume strong leadership to responsibly lead the party. 
  I have told all the ministers of the cabinet to unite around 
the prime minister. I have told each ministry of the cabinet to 
stop pursuing only its own interests. I have also told the 
prime minister that he must responsibly supervise each ministry. 
  I have entrusted Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil with every 
right and responsibility. 
  [CHOSON ILBO reporter Kim Chang-ki] Many people have pointed 
out that you, Mr. President, rely too heavily on private 
channels, instead of official channels, in deciding on major 
policies, selecting government officials, and tapping public 
opinion. Would you comment on this? 
  [President Kim] I listen to the opinion of various people. 
I listen to people's opinions through both private and official 
channels. I also receive reports from various government 
offices. When selecting people for government offices, I fully 
examine candidates. I do not expect to get a perfect score each 
time. Not everybody is satisfied with what I have done. I 
don't think that you should be too concernced about this matter, 
though. 
  The presidency is a lonely and painful job. A president must 
make resolute decisions on numerous issues. Many people even 
tell me that while I smiled frequently and appeared bright 
before becoming president, I now appear grim. I may have 
overexerted myself worrying about the hazards of cold weather 
this summer and floods from heavy rainfall. Everyday, I worry 
about numerous things. I hope you understand that I appear grim 
for this reason. I also hope you understand that I do not make 
hasty decisions. My decisions are made after extensive 
deliberation. 
  [Unidentified foreign reporter, in English] At the last 
press conference, you said that the DPRK's nuclear development 
was the biggest obstacle to inter-Korean confidence. So if the 
nuclear problem is solved, do you think that trust can be built 
between the North and South? And, what concrete measures will 
your government take to improve bilateral relations? Thank you. 
  [President Kim] I have various plans in mind. We are 
mapping out plans now. Since negotiations are now being held on 
this matter, however, I think not elaborating on this issue now 
will benefit negotiations. I hope you understand. 
  [Kim Hyon-il, CHUNGANG ILBO reporter] There are many 
people, except those from the so-called Democratic Faction, who 
say that you, the president, are a tough person [musopta]. What 
do you think about this? 
  In addition, I hear that there are indications that the 
party 
congress may not be held in May. Will you please explain your 
idea of intraparty harmony in relation to the continuation of 
Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil's system? 
  [President Kim] It seems that people are inclined to 
describe me as a tough man because I carried out many tough 
things during the era of confrontation between democratic and 
antidemocratic forces. 
  I am not a tough but a soft man. 
  Since very capable officials, including Executive Chairman 
Kim Chong-pil, were elected recently to key party positions, I 
am confident of the satisfactory and harmonious operation of the 
party in future, as well. 
  [Kim Chung-il, KYONGHYANG SINMUN reporter] Mr. President, 
you said that you would go anywhere in the world for the nation. 
Yet, you have not visited the three neighboring countries. 
Will you elaborate on plans to visit foreign countries like 
these three countries and what work will you conduct during your 
visits? 
  [President Kim] As I stated in my opening remarks, when 
Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa visited our country some time 
ago, he extended an official invitation for me to visit. At the 
time, I pledged that I would visit Japan within this year 
without fail. 
  Were the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] summit not 
held last year, I would not have gone overseas. However, since 
an important APEC summit was held, and considering the great 
significance of such a summit, I went overseas and also held a 
ROK-U.S. summit during the visit. 
  I will fulfill the pledge I made to Prime Minister Hosokawa. 
After discussing an appropriate time through diplomatic 
channels, I will decide on a time for the visit. 
  I think it would be better not to elaborate on visits to 
other countries at this time. 
  [Edward Paisley, FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW reporter] Mr. 
President, high wages in South Korea are one of the problems 
facing Korea's international competitiveness. The Korean Trade 
Union congress, which represents hundreds of thousands of 
workers but it is still illegal in Korea, has offered to lower 
its wages and benefit demands in exchange for recognition and 
non-wage concessions from management. Your government has 
rejected this approach in 1993. Will you reconsider this in 
1994 in light of wage growth of 13 percent in 1993? 
  [President Kim] As I stated earlier, the most important goal 
this year is to enhance international competitiveness. Facing 
an era of internationalization, we should win in the economic 
war without fail. The most important factor to winning is 
cooperation between management and workers. I want to emphasize 
this point. 
  Of course, as mentioned earlier, there are various 
organizations under labor unions. Also, there are many people 
who give priority to the interest of the nation, which must be 
highly considered even at this moment. I attended the New 
Year's ceremony held by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry on 
5 January and had dialogues with businessmen. There I met many 
businessmen from the thirty large enterprises since the 
financial real-name transaction system was adopted last year and 
said to them: Changes have taken place in our business circles' 
past habits. For example, frankly speaking, the businessmen 
gave money to rulers in the past, but I, during my tenure, will 
never accept money, not even a penny, from anyone. Therefore, 
the businessmen must use the money they want to give me to 
promote investment in enterprises, to improve technology, and to 
enhance workers' welfare. 
  In the second half of last year, our enterprises made 
all-out 
efforts to gain a trade surplus. The correct statistics 
regarding this issue can be announced around next month, but, as 
of today, this surplus amount is estimated to be approximately 
$2.0 billion, and the current account surplus approximately $200 
million. For the first time in four years, we could gain this 
surplus. 
  Regarding the wage issue, as mentioned earlier, I believe 
that this issue can be satisfactorily resolved between 
consultations between workers and owners this year as well. 
  In raising international competitiveness this year, most 
important is to improve technology, to achieve harmony between 
workers and owners, and to expand social indirect capital. It 
is also important to boldly lift various restrictions that block 
the development of the country. By doing so, we are going to 
seek the revitalization of the economy. The issue of harmony 
between workers and owners is very important in revitalizing the 
economy. Because of this, I told businessmen to hold dialogues 
with workers from now on regarding the labor issue in stead of 
holding dialogues with them when the issue becomes serious as 
was done in last year. As a result, dialogues between workers 
and owners are now very active. 
  There are some people who worry over the labor dispute this 
year, but I believe that this issue can be resolved through 
dialogues. I believe, therefore, that it is possible to resolve 
the issue when we concentrate all efforts and wisdom on its 
settlement. 
  [Unidentified Japanese reporter] I have a question for you 
regarding the nuclear issue. I feel that you seem to avoid 
giving concrete answers regarding the nuclear issue by saying 
that it is now under discussion or it is a delicate issue. I 
believe that many countries are interested in and keep an eye on 
the nuclear issue. Your Excellency President Kim said that a 
sign of changes have been shown in North Korea even now while 
you are delivering your speech. We wonder, however, if changes 
are really taking place in North Korea. You also said that you 
can not accept President Kim Il-song's speech as it is, and that 
one should see things behind the contents. I would appreciate 
it if you could specifically explain what kinds of changes are 
taking place in North Korea and where the source came from. 
  [President Kim] Thank you. I repeat to you once again. As 
of this moment, for example, as of this morning, various 
negotiations between the United States and North Korea are 
underway. As I stated before, I would like to stress, however, 
that this does not mean that the ROK is excluded from 
negotiations, and that its intentions are respected. After 
consulting with the ROK, the United States is holding dialogues 
with North Korea. Even North Korea knows it. North Korea does 
not think that the United States holds dialogue with it, 
ignoring the ROK's intentions. North Korea knows that the 
United States holds dialogue with it after consulting with the 
ROK. I believe that the contents of negotiations, which were 
held as of this morning, must not be disclosed. Therefore, I 
hope for your understanding. I will say, however, progress is 
being made in negotiations. 
  [Kim Song-pok, KOREA TIMES reporter] Recently, in 
connection with easing regulations in the economic field, the 
economic circle is saying that regulations must be completely 
abolished. What is your view on this matter? 
  [President Kim] Our government's policy is to ease 
regulations to the utmost so that the people can freely carry 
out business activities. We will work to ease regulations to 
the utmost. 
  [Adrian Edwards, BBC News reporter] About the North Korean 
nuclear situation again. It appears we are moving toward a 
stage of some limited nuclear inspections being accepted by 
North Korea. Would you view limited inspection as a resolution 
of the issue or would it have to go much further? 
  [President Kim] As I have said before, the nuclear 
inspection issue is an issue to be resolved between North Korea 
and the IAEA. IAEA's position on this matter is very strong. I 
as well as the IAEA think that holding inspection superficially 
has little significance. Therefore, I believe that we cannot 
reach a conclusion on this matter at this stage. 
  [Chon Yong-hak, Seoul Broadcasting Service reporter] A price 
hike centered on public utility charges is notable from the 
beginning of this year. Amid this kind of price instability, do 
you think that the economy can be activated and that there will 
be no labor-management dispute? 
  [President Kim] Our public utility charge is the most 
inexpensive in the world. There are many problems because we 
did not raise the public utility charge for a long time. One of 
the most important goals in our policy for this year is to 
achieve price stability. If there is no price stability, 
nothing can be achieved. I have already ordered that work be 
carried out to stabilize prices. Each matter regarding price 
stability will be worked out in detail. I believe that achieving 
price stability is an important yardstick in reviving the 
economy this year. 
  [Kim Se-hyong, MAEIL KYONGJE SINMUN reporter] Recently, 
there are moves to reduce the organization at some ministries. 
Is this related with the plan to form a small government which 
you talked about during the presidential election? Also, to 
what degree will this be extended? Can you give us your view on 
this matter? 
  [President Kim] What is most important for us is to adapt to 
change. If we follow work that was carried out 20-30 years ago, 
this will be a great problem. As the world changes, we must 
also change. We will never be able to win in an era of 
unlimited competition if we remain unchanged. Therefore, we 
must prudently examine this matter and decide on how we will 
deal with it after viewing what is truly good for the people and 
what is efficient. 
  [Ko To-won, CHUNGANG KYONGJE SINMUN reporter] Whenever you 
had the opportunity you said that if North Korea's nuclear issue 
is resolved you will promote South-North economic cooperation. 
In your speech today, you said that if the nuclear issue is 
resolved, practical South-North relations will be promoted 
rapidly. Can you give us your concrete plan? 
  [President Kim] I believe that it is correct to talk about 
this matter after the nuclear issue is resolved. Frankly 
speaking, North Korea is currently listening to everything we 
are saying. I don't think talking about this matter at this 
time will be helpful with the ongoing negotiations. I hope that 
you will understand the situation and be patient. 
  [Ko To-won, CHUNGANG KYONGJE SINMUN reporter] Mr. 
President, you have powerfully carried out changes and reform in 
many fields of our society since the new government came to 
office. As a result, you have won great applause from the 
people. However, people say that while this was of much concern 
to people in the past, no noteworthy changes and reforms have 
been undertaken in the educational domain. The education 
minister is present here. People expressed both interest and 
concern upon her appointment. Can you explain your ideas for 
future educational reform in more detail? 
  [President Kim] I think that of all reforms, education 
reform is most important. All work in our society is conducted 
by people. And people are formed by education. Thus, education 
is, at the same time, the most difficult work. 
  All successive governments in the past carried out various 
educational policies, from a system of school entrance 
examinations to educational reform drives, in an excessively 
improvisational manner, thus causing great confusion among the 
people. 
  As the result of this, our education system has failed to 
advance and has instead regressed. Taking the example of 
foreign educational systems, I think early education of people 
is desirable. With early education, people will be able to 
learn many things promptly. 
  Our examination system is too complicated. Our people are 
greatly confused over this aspect of our educational system. We 
must carefully review this issue. I have already discussed it 
with the education minister. I plan to form an Education Reform 
Committee so as to fully discuss these problems in this 
committee. I believe that the new education minister has a 
number of ideas on educational reform and will excel in 
implementing them. 
  [Yi Kum-hyon, reporter for THE ECONOMIST] I would like to 
ask questions about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula 
and the decision of the South Korean government to give up 
nuclear development. 
  Mr. President, in your speech this morning, you said that 
each nation will make maximum efforts to protect its own 
interests. I wonder if you, Mr. President, believe that the ROK 
Government's decision to abandon nuclear development will 
benefit the national interests of South Korea today and of a 
reunified ROK nation? 
  Second, will you explain whether the decision to abandon 
nuclear development may change according to changes in the 
surrounding conditions and to each nation's situation? 
  [President Kim] Thank you. The ROK people truly love peace. 
We were always attacked by other people. Never have we attacked 
others. This will not change in the future. Our defense of the 
Armistice Line and the Team Spirit exercise is aimed at 
defending ourselves, not at attacking others. 
  South Korea will never develop nuclear weapons in the 
future. 
I make it clear South Korea will never develop fearful nuclear 
weapons because this will absolutely threaten peace on the 
Korean peninsula, bring dire misfortunes to the lives of the 70 
million fellow countrymen, result in building a big powder 
magazine in Northeast Asia, and is not beneficial to peace in 
the world. 
  Now, I wish to conclude the news conference now. Thank you.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 6 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's 
New Year press conference Thursday got a mixed reaction: The 
administration and Kim's own party hailed the chief executive 
for unveiling the direction of his policy in the coming year, 
while the opposition criticized his policy as unrealistic. 
  The prime minister's office gave the president a high rating 
because he presented the principle and direction of the policy 
he will pursue in the second year of his administration. 
  He was clear and full of confidence in his speech, and his 
appeal for concerted efforts at national development and 
improved standards of living was impressive, it said. 
  Kim's stress on increased international competitiveness was 
a 
proper policy direction for the first year of an unlimited trade 
war under the Uruguay Round trade pact, it said. 
  The National Unification Board said it was encouraged by the 
optimism that Kim expressed about the future of inter-Korean 
relations and expected his optimism to have a positive influence 
on the North Korean nuclear issue, which is in the final stage 
prior to solution. 
  The Foreign Ministry, which is in charge of the North Korean 
nuclear problem, said it viewed Kim's remarks that he would do 
his best to solve the nuclear issue and to improve inter-Korean 
relations as the expression of a strong will to unravel pending 
issues with North Korea. 
  Kim's positive view of the nuclear issue will help bring 
North Korea to the meeting table as there are indications that 
the North Koreans are moving to change their policy on this 
issue, a ministry spokesman said. 
  The Defense Ministry said it was pleased with Kim's call on 
the people to support and encourage the armed forces in its 
process of rebirth under his military reform policy, which he 
said he would continue in his second year in office. But some 
ministry officials were worried about the possibility of a purge 
of the military under his reform policy this year. 
  Members of Kim's Democratic Liberal Party, especially its 
conservatives, said they were very happy with the president's 
remarks that he, as president of the party, will not call a 
national convention in May and that he will keep DLP Chairman 
Kim Chong-pil in place for at least the coming 12 months. 
  Kim said politics should no longer be "a burden on the 
people" and that all political energy and resources should be 
focused on boosting the economy, especially on restructuring 
agriculture so that it can get over the hardships of farm market 
opening under the global trade pact, deputy party spokesman Cho 
Yong-chik, who belongs to Chairman Kim's conservative faction of 
the DLP, said. 
  Under Chairman Kim's leadership, the party is firmly united 
to support President Kim in carrying out his policies, Cho added. 
  The democratic justice faction, which is also conservative, 
attached less importance to President Kim's support of Chairman 
Kim's leadership, saying that President Kim stressed the need to 
place more emphasis on the economy than on politics this year. 
  The opposition Democratic Party said that it was 
disappointed 
at President Kim's address, because he was not specific on 
pending issues. He failed to present any specific measures 
against inflation, though this is one of the most important 
problems to the people, and this reflects his easy-going 
attitude on the pressing issues, party spokesman Pak Chi-won 
said. 
  "He also failed to provide any specific programs for 
internationalization and market opening, which he so 
emphatically talked about," he added. "He disregarded the 
people's right to know by refusing to discuss the progress in 
negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue." 
  Pak said that not calling a national convention of his party 
this year reflected Kim's plan to neutralize politics by 
rejecting party activity and consolidating one-man rule. 
  Rep. Mun Hui-sang, chief secretary to party chairman Yi 
Ki-taek, charged that Kim did not go beyond basic and general 
theories in discussing his policy. 
  "For instance, he emphasized the need to increase 
competitiveness but he did not say anything specific about his 
labor policy...," moon said. "His agricultural policy also lacks 
specifics." 
  Rep. Kim Pyong-o, chief policymaker of the party, said: 
"It's a farce that President Kim adorns his New Year press 
conference with rosy optimism in this era of international 
competition in which the law of the jungle prevails." 
  He said he regretted that Kim failed to offer a plan for 
inter-Korean arms reduction, cultural exchange and economic 
cooperation when peace settles on the Korean peninsula.

  [Excerpts] Seoul, Jan. 6 (YONHAP) -- As in his first press 
conference, in June last year to mark 100 days in office, 
President Kim Yong-sam did not prepare questions to be asked nor 
designate questioners beforehand in Thursday's [6 January] New 
Year news conference at Chongwadae [presidential office]. Kim 
is said to have thoroughly prepared for his "live" encounter 
with the media since the middle of last month, making revisions 
over the year-end weekend. 
  Presidential aides chose this year's tasks to be reported 
and 
senior press secretary Chu Ton-sik drafted the speech based on 
their recommendations. 
  Kim, making jokes off and on, displayed confidence 
throughout 
the 75-minute-long conference even while receiving questions. 
Writing down every question, he showed efforts to make his 
answers as sincere as possible. He invited 70 reporters from 
the foreign press, and the same number of Korean reporters, and 
tried to give them equal chances to ask questions. 
  -- Unlike the June conference, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang 
and all cabinet members, Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil and 
leading policymakers of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, and 
Chief of Staff Pak Kwan-yong and senior presidential secretaries 
were present. 
  "New Year conference will be unveiling a blueprint for this 
year's work and I think their (all cabinet, DLP [Democratic 
Liberal Party] policymakers, presidential secretariat) presence 
is aimed at showing the determination of the government and its 
party," a presidential aide said. 
  Kim made his New Year speech without the help of a 
teleprompter as he wanted to appear to the public as natural and 
spontaneous as possible, he said. 
  -- President Kim Yong-sam started his New Year's press 
conference by reading from prepared text for about 27 minutes 
and then spent around 50 minutes answering questions. Reporters 
raised their hands and Kim randomly selected 14 from Korean 
media and five foreign correspondents. [passage omitted] 
  -- Reporters burst into laughter when President Kim Yong-sam 
evaded attempts to get him to elaborate on possible improvement 
in inter-Korean relations after the North Korean nuclear issue 
is resolved by noting that the North Koreans were also listening 
to his news conference. 
  Kim smiled at a question about the future of close aide Rep. 
Kim Tok-yong, who was excluded from recent cabinet and party 
reshuffles. 
  "What a strange question to ask," he said, but nevertheless 
he answered it. "We (Kim and I) go back a long way. My 
affection for Rep. Kim, who has been through the long and dark 
opposition days, remains the same." 
  "Too many hands," Kim observed, when almost all reporters 
shot up their arms for a chance to ask a question. Trying to 
give all a chance, Kim paid attention to foreign reporters 
seated at the back of the room and pointed to a woman reporter. 
He also said thank you to each foreign reporter when they 
finished a question. 
  -- Told that he depended too much on private channels in 
policymaking, President Kim Yong-sam said that that was an easy 
thing to say but untrue. 
  "You needn't worry about that, because I listen to opinions 
through both public and private channels when deciding a policy 
or making appointments," he said. 
  Kim laughed when he was described as "fearful." 
  "I think you say that because I did tough things in the 
opposition days... I'm actually a gentle type," he said. 
  -- After his news conference, President Kim Yong-sam shook 
hands with cabinet members, leaders of his party and reporters. 
He then met with cabinet members, party leaders and senior 
presidential staff to review the press conference. 
  "I think I couldn't give all a chance to ask... As I said in 
the press conference, I hope the party and government unite in 
one mind to save the country this year," he said. 
  Labor Minister Nam Chae-hui said that he thought the foreign 
reporter who asked about illegal trade union activities and high 
labor costs was not fully satisfied with the president's answer, 
so he went to the reporter after the press conference to explain 
the government position. 
  Marking Kim's words that he will not hold a party convention 
in May but retain Kim Chong-pil as chairman, some ministers went 
up to Kim Chong-pil and jokingly congratulated him on "today's 
party convention." 
  Chongwadae officials refused to comment on the news 
conference, but hinted at satisfaction with Kim's tactfulness 
and spontaneity. 
  Although the president evaded questions on the North Korean 
nuclear problem, he made his point clear in all other issues, 
the officials noted. They explained that Kim's comment that it 
is wrong to stick with 30-year-old ways of working and thinking 
should not be taken as his word on reorganization of the 
government. 
  "The president did not mean government restructuring, but 
some role changes considered by some ministries," Chief 
Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 6 (YONHAP) -- Major economic 
organizations welcomed President Kim Yong-sam's New Year address 
Thursday [6 January] because it set the goal of state 
administration for the new year as improvement of the country's 
competitiveness in the new age of internationalization and 
openness. 
  The Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that Kim's 
speech would help provide momentum and encourage industry since 
it presented a policy direction aimed at expansion of 
infrastructure, relaxation of administrative regulations and 
improvement of industrial structure for ensuring 
cost-effectiveness. 
  The Federation of Korean Industries [FKI] said it was proper 
for the government to relax administrative regulations, boost 
investment, increase exports through industrial peace and revive 
the economy. FKI said it was waiting for concrete follow-up 
measures to boost industry. 
  The Korea Foreign Trade Association said that the target for 
improving competitiveness was timely because this is in an age 
of internationalization and openness, but it sought concrete 
measures for continual growth of exports. 
  The Korea Federation of Small Business said the government's 
strong will to increase competitiveness was encouraging for 
small companies but it hoped more substantial measures would be 
taken to boost the competitiveness of small companies as they 
are the roots of the national economy. 
  It expressed satisfaction that the government will form a 
committee on development in rural and fishery areas to advise 
the president how to support farmers and fishers, who may suffer 
the largest loss because of the Uruguay Round trade accord. 
  The Korea Employers' Federation said President Kim had given 
economic activists confidence by showing a direction for the 
economy to follow, but called on the government to pay more 
interest in industrial harmony.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- The ruling and opposition 
parties have begun to take action to dampen the already 
overheating atmosphere for elections of heads of local 
autonomous governing bodies more than a year from now. No 
sooner had 1994 dawned on this land of politics-preoccupied 
people than they began to talk about the local elections, aided 
by the speculation, gossip and even idle chat being circulated 
widely as "political news" in newspapers and on television. 
  There have been suggestions that the government and ruling 
party will scrap the current system of special cities, like 
Seoul and Pusan, merging them with rural areas and redrawing 
election districts in a Korean version of gerrymandering. 
Immediately, vehement charges were leveled against what 
apparently was a balloon floated by someone to test the 
reaction, mainly from opposition parties, to the idea of 
redistricting. 
  There have also been reports that the government and ruling 
party are planning to reshuffle provincial governors and large 
city mayors soon in an attempt to put them in advantageous 
positions in preparation for the local elections. 
  Surprised at how quickly their political game overheated, 
the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and main opposition 
Democratic Party (DP) hastily called party postholder meetings 
Tuesday and declared that "It is undesirable to go into the 
election campaigns already." 
  There are too many items on the political agenda that 
require 
immediate attention, they said. But there is a gulf between the 
DLP and the DP in their views on what they have to do right now 
and what they would do for the local elections. 
  The ruling party says what it has to do now is to carry out 
the national policy of President Kim Yong-sam smoothly and help 
him to strengthen the nation's economic competitive power in the 
era of globalization. 
  At the same time, the ruling party is tacitly showing that 
its electoral strength is not so "weak" that it needs to redraw 
the boundaries of administrative districts. 
  DLP Secretary-general Mun Chong-su said that if his party 
and 
the government succeed in reforming and boosting the competitive 
power of the country, they can even win the mayoral election in 
Seoul, traditionally a bulwark of the opposition. 
  Meanwhile, the DP has picked three major issues -- 
inflation, 
the North Korean nuclear question, and the effects of the 
Uruguay Round of trade negotiations -- as needing quick 
solutions. 
  In order to discuss these issues, the DP is demanding that 
the National Assembly hold an extraordinary session in January. 
  The reason for the DP to show a sharp reaction to any 
suggestion of administrative redistricting is because it is wary 
of the purpose behind the move by the ruling party and the 
government, rather than the redistricting itself. 
  Rep. Cho Se-hyong, a member of the Supreme Council of the 
Democratic Party, alleged that Kim Yong-sam helped "overheat" 
the election atmosphere from January 1992 in order to win the 
preidential election that December. 
  "Local elections have to be held normally," he said, without 
elaborating on what he meant by "normally." 
  In any event, the DP believes that there is a strong 
possibility that the ruling party and government will redraw the 
administrative districts in order to put themselves in a better 
position for the local elections. 
  The DP bases its belief on the fact that Choe Yang-pu, who 
was recently appointed senior presidential secretary for 
agricultural affairs, published a book in 1988 that advocates 
rational administrative redistricting, merging large cities with 
rural areas. 
  The gist of his idea was to form one special city and 16 
provinces. 
  The opposition, while protesting the move for administrative 
redistricting, is already working on countermeasures, party 
sources said.

<F P=106> [Article by Yi Sang-ki] </F>
  [Text] With the release from their posts of Lieutenant 
General Yi Taek-hyong (the 19th Class of the Korean Military 
Academy, KMA), chief of the Strategic Planning Bureau of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS] and member of Hanahoe, a 
once-powerful ROK Army inner circle, and Lieutenant General Kim 
Sang-chun (the 19th Class of the KMA), director of the 
Operations Center at the JCS and Hanahoe member, and their 
return to Army Headquarters on last 30 December, the public's 
attention is focused on how National Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae will deal in the future with officers affiliated with 
Hanahoe. 
  It was learned that the personnel reshuffle of the two 
lieutenant generals this time was in line with the military 
reforms by the ROK military authorities following the release 
from his post in July last year of Major General Yi Chung-sok, 
(the 21st Class of the KMA), director of the Operations Bureau 
at the JCS, because of the "remarks" he reportedly made at a 
dinner party of the JCS. (He was discharged from the Army in 
August) 
  However, the fact that the two lieutenant generals had still 
one year left in their terms of office at the posts and that 
their release was the first personnel action taken by the newly 
appointed minister, who was also a Hanahoe member, can be viewed 
to be quite unusual. 
  On 30 December last year Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae 
called 
General Kim Tong-chin, chief of staff of the ROK Army, into his 
office and had a 30-minute secret conversation with him. In the 
conversation Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reportedly informed 
General Kim Tong-chin of his plan to eliminate Army officers 
affiliated with Hanahoe. Thus, the release of the two lieutenant 
generals at the JCS became the first personnel action that the 
new defense minister took after consulting with Chongwadae 
[presidential office]. 
  Accordingly, people are predicting that the National Defense 
Ministry under the new minister will follow a "hardline" track 
in dealing with Hanahoe-affiliated officers. On the eve of the 
Army's periodic personnel reshuffle of last fall, General Kim 
Tong-chin, chief of staff of the Army, declared that 
"Hanahoe-affiliated officers who have enjoyed thus far special 
favor in promotion and duty position will be subjected to 
disadvantage for one year." Our attention is focussed on whether 
such a promise by General Kim will be carried out. 
  Moreover, many people indicate that there is a good 
possibility that a conflict between the "hardliner" defense 
minister and "lenient" chief of staff of the Army will take 
place in dealing with Hanahoe-affiliated officers. 
  On the other hand, some people hold that the fact that the 
new minister was member of Hanahoe will rather narrow the scope 
of his activity of handling Hanahoe-affiliated officers in the 
future. This is convincing. Convincing is also the analysis that 
President Kim Yong-sam's plan to "eliminate Hanahoe members 
through a Hanahoe member" is based on his high-level political 
calculation. Some people also indicate that although Defense 
Minister Yi himself was a Hanahoe member, but belonged to an 
alienated group within Hanahoe and that, therefore, he has not 
good feelings toward Hanahoe itself. 
  Being a member of Hanahoe, if Defense Minister Yi withdraws 
the disadvantage in promotion and duty position imposed on 
Hanahoe members, this may create a serious conflict between 
those officers from the KMA and those from non-KMA background 
and between Hanahoe member officers and non-Hanahoe member 
officers. 
  On the other hand, a section of the military circles 
estimates that under the new government the principle of 
eliminating Hanahoe-affiliated officers will be thoroughly 
adhered to and that the emergence of those pro-U.S.-leaning 
general officers or those general officers with some connections 
with the United States will be remarkable. 
  In this connection, noting that the United States, which 
exercised great influence in the military personnel affairs 
during the era of President Pak Chong-hui, could not fully 
exercise its influence during the fifth and sixth republics 
because of the emergence of Hanahoe-affiliated officers a 
military source predicts that the U.S. influence over the 
military personnel affairs of the ROK Armed Forces will be 
revived in the future.

  [Text] Samsung Electronics, the nation's leading 
semiconductor manufacturer, will establish a joint chip 
production plant in Portugal with Texas Instruments (TI) of the 
United States, the company announced yesterday. Samsung is the 
first Korean semiconductor firm to build an overseas production 
plant. Under an agreement on capital ties, Samsung and TI will 
invest a total of $50 million to expand a TI plant in Porto, 
northern Portugal, according to the company. 
  At the plant, TI has been producing low value-added 
nonmemory 
chips. Samsung and TI will equip the plant with advanced 
semiconductor production facilities. Samsung will concentrate 
on 4M and 16M DRAM memory chips for sale in European countries, 
while TI will produce high value-added logic chips, according to 
the company. The plant will begin operations in the second half 
of this year. With the facilities, Samsung will be able to 
expand semiconductor exports to European countries without being 
embroiled in trade disputes, a company spokesman said. 
  Samsung and TI reached the agreement on the joint-venture 
plant last December and have been waiting for the go-ahead from 
the Portuguese Government. The two obtained approval recently. 
  The agreement basically concerns capital ties for the plant 
and hence does not involve technological or business 
cooperation. But the two intend to increase their ties in the 
future, according to a company spokesman. 
  Last November, Samsung signed an accord on technological 
cooperation with Micron Technology of the United States for the 
development of the next-generation memory chips. Taken 
together, the two agreements laid the foundation for closer 
cooperation between the United States and Korea in the field of 
semiconductors, the company said.

<F P=106> [Report on a SIN TONG-A poll of 72 political reporters on </F>
the performances of the 14th National Assembly and its members, 
by the SIN TONG-A Editorial Department] 
  [Text] A year and a half has elapsed since the 14th 
National Assembly was sworn in. How is the public viewing it? 
SIN TONG-A has conducted a survey to evaluate its performance 
and performances of individual assemblymen. 
  Analyses and evaluations of parliamentary activities and of 
individual lawmakers should, in principle, be carried out by 
directly polling voters. Realistically, however, data on 
parliamentary activities are not readily available for the 
public. Of late, Kyongsilnyon and a few other groups and 
scholars have begun monitoring, analyzing, and evaluating 
assemblymen's parliamentary activities, but their work is still 
in its initial stage and unable to offer information to the 
public in general. 
  Considering these facts, the survey was carried out by 
polling political reporters of newspapers, radios and press 
agencies assigned to the coverage of the National Assembly, 
political parties and individual lawmakers. The reason was that 
the public is inevitably influenced by mass media in their 
impressions of the National Assembly and its members, and that 
the evaluations by reporters watching political developments can 
provide important data. At the same time, SIN TONG-A's judgement 
was that they can speak accurately for the public on their 
feelings toward the National Assembly and its members. 
  Our purpose was to verify if the assemblymen elected are 
performing as the voters want them to. It was not our purpose to 
make any journalistic approach to parliamentary politics or to 
show the likes or dislikes about any individual lawmakers. 
  The poll was conducted by distributing the prepared 
questionnaire sheets--listing 14 questions about activities of 
the National Assembly and its members--directly to reporters at 
the reporters rooms in the National Assembly and the Democratic 
Liberal Party [DLP] and Democratic Party [DP] headquarters, and 
retrieving after they filled them out. A hundred-odd 
questionnaire sheets were distributed and 72 reporters 
responded. The retrieved sheets showed traces of great pains 
they took with their responses. 
  The 14th National Assembly--the result of the general 
election held on 24 March--opened on a squeaking note. The 
ruling and opposition parties, in a confrontation over the issue 
of the legally overdue mayoral and gubernatorial elections, had 
already clashed in the bargaining over the procedures of the 
opening. The assembly barely managed to open on 29 June, 
recessing without doing anything but electing the speaker (Pak 
Chun-kyu) and vice speakers (Hwang Nak-chu and Ho Kyong-man). 
Thus, it idled away its 30-day first session. 
  Then, the DLP decided to unilaterally convene the National 
Assembly to railroad a revision of the local autonomy law (for 
holding the mayoral and gubernatorial elections in 1995). The 
assembly was convened on 1 August but the limping continued. 
Meanwhile, the regular plenary session opened on 14 September 
but, under the pressure of the upcoming presidential election, 
had to recess in less than 50 days or half of its legal length. 
Although it barely completed its formation in early October, the 
14th National Assembly remained unable to concentrate on its 
primary duty because of the imminent presidential election. 
  Then came the forceful reform drive of President Kim 
Yong-sam 
early this year, flustering the National Assembly. Assemblymen 
do not dare to conceive institutionalization of reform, or 
checking government policies, or presenting alternative 
policies. They only dithered about trying to read the 
president's mind. The upheavals brought on by the 
administration's audit-and-inspection and the public disclosure 
of property programs plunged the National Assembly into an 
unprecedented crisis, forcing a former speaker and the current 
speaker to resign their assembly seats. Even the opposition, not 
to mention the government party, could not properly respond to 
the reform wind. Assemblymen exposed themselves as a bunch of 
weaklings who would only sit back and watch the president's 
"one-man race." 
  Also, in the parliamentary inquiries into the Yulgok defense 
buildup program, the 12.12 [12 December 1979] incident and the 
Peace Dam scandal, the 14th National Assembly indeed made its 
efforts to bring out the truth but, to the eyes of the public, 
its performance fell short of their expectations. The public 
also assessed as inadequate its performance in the regular 
parliamentary inspection of the administration this year. 
Furthermore, it even wasted a whole week because of the squabble 
over the liquidation-of-the-past issue, demonstrating that as 
far as the National Assembly is concerned, nothing has changed. 
  Such being its performance, the appraisals of the 14th 
National Assembly could be anything but high. Of the 
respondents, 66.7 percent (48 persons) saw no particular 
difference in it from its predecessors, while 8.3 percent gave 
it negative ratings--6.9 percent viewed its level of 
parliamentary activity as "relatively low" and 1.4 percent as 
"low." On the other hand, a quarter of the respondents (18 
persons, 25.0 percent) gave it positive ratings, viewing the 
14th National Assembly as performing more constructively than 
any of its predecessors. 
  Compared with a similar survey conducted by SIN TONG-A in 
1991, the numbers indicate that the 14th National Assembly are 
rated more favorably than the 13th. In the 1991 survey, only 
12.9 percent gave the 13th National Assembly positive ratings 
while 38.6 percent voted in the negative and 48.6 percent said 
that it was a mediocre assembly. The survey this time found a 
decrease in the negative responses and a gain in the positive. 
  Nevertheless, two-thirds of the respondents could find 
nothing new of the present National Assembly. This seems to 
reaffirm the fact that in contrast to developments in other 
realms, nothing has changed in the political world, and that the 
public sees the way the National Assembly is in the negative 
light. 
  In the questionnaire, the reporters were asked what they saw 
as the most distinguishing feature of the 14th National 
Assembly. Nearly one-half (33 persons, 45.8 percent) cited the 
presentation of alternative policies while only 6.9 percent and 
2.8 percent respectively picked legislative activities and 
activities to check the administration, both the primary 
functions of the National Assembly, in what seems to unveil a 
legislature overwhelmed by the government's reform drive. 
  Some respondents noted that even in the presentation of 
alternative policies, the 14th National Assembly does not 
measure up to expectations. Their point is that thanks to 
efforts by some assemblymen who breathed fresh air into the 
assembly, parliamentary activities showed some signs of 
productiveness but nevertheless failed to be positive in showing 
alternative policies. In this connection, two reporters 
commented that the legislature is in a "state of lethargy." 
  Noteworthy is the fact that 41.7 percent of the respondents 
(30 persons) picked "improvement in ethical consciousness" as 
the distinguishing feature of the 14th National Assembly. It 
seems to be a natural aftermath of the audit-and-inspection and 
public disclosure of property upheavals; however, it can be said 
that the rise in ethical consciousness has its limitations 
because it represented not the result of a voluntary resolution 
or movement of the National Assembly but a passive response to 
the president's "high-handed" drive. 
  No matter what led to it, the fact that assemblymen made a 
public disclosure of their wealth for the first time is 
recognized as an extraordinary change, not only because it will 
undoubtedly help end irregularities and corruption in elections 
that have been frowned upon by the public, but also because it 
will go a long way toward shutting off from politics those who 
accumulated their wealth by dishonest means. 
  In this connection, it is noteworthy that 75.0 percent of 
the 
respondents found assemblymen "wealthier than I thought." A look 
at the disclosed property of grade-one or higher officials in 
the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, the 
Constitutional Court, and the Central Election 
Committee--disclosed to the public on 7 September in accordance 
with the Public Office Holders Ethics Law--will explain the 
reason for the high percentage. While the public disclosure 
involved a total of 1,167 officials, as many as 64 assemblymen 
were among the top 100 "men of wealth." 
  Especially, the top 15 were all assemblymen. Conspicuously, 
however, none of those picked by the reporters as "assemblyman 
of outstanding legislative activity" or "promising assemblyman" 
or "assemblyman of high credibility among colleagues" was 
included among them. 
  The average wealth of assemblymen was reported at 2.61 
billion won, somewhat close to the average worth of the entire 
public office holders subjected to the disclosure action, which 
was 1.42 billion won. In particular, the average worth of DLP 
lawmakers was 3.25 billion won, compared with 1.26 billion won 
of opposition assemblymen, or the executive branch's 860 million 
won, or the judicial branch's 1.19 billion won. 
  Meanwhile, 9.7 percent of the respondents saw the disclosed 
wealth of assemblymen as an "appropriate size" and 12.5 percent 
as "smaller than I thought." Two persons said that they have no 
answer. 
  The next question was about the pay for the assemblymen. At 
a 
glance, the responses appeared to contradict those concerning 
the wealth of assemblymen, for 30.6 percent saw the need for a 
large pay raise and 44.4 percent a small raise. In other words, 
75.0 percent were of the opinion that they should be given a 
raise. Meanwhile, 22.2 percent said that the present pay scale 
is appropriate. One reporter said that their pay should be cut. 
(Another had no answer.) 
  One of the respondents explained that "the responses that 
the 
amount of their wealth is unexpectedly large are average of the 
legislative branch. As for those young and new assemblymen, we 
feel that the present pay scale is not enough to assure 
satisfactory parliamentary activities." 
  What he means is that assemblymen need political funds for 
satisfactory parliamentary activities, and because it is 
difficult to raise the necessary funds from supporters alone, 
the government should help them. 
<H5>  Ex-Activists Leading in Legislative Activities </H5>
  The reporters were then asked about the "necessary 
conditions 
for satisfactory legislative activities." They were asked to 
consider four elements--assemblyman's political insight, 
political fund, party support, and activity for 
constituency--and indicate the order of precedence. The result: 
69 persons or 95.8 percent picked "assemblyman's political 
insight" as the most important element. Only 4.2 percent (3 
persons) voted for "political fund" as the most important. None 
picked "party support" or "activity for constituency" for the 
top place. For the second important factor, 31.9 percent picked 
"political fund" while 29.1 percent voted for "party support." 
And 16.6 percent picked "activity for constituency" as the next 
important factor. 
  Then, what are the levels of the members of the 14th 
National 
Assembly to the eyes of the reporters who see "political 
insight" as the most important qualification of assemblyman? How 
many do they think have the capabilities and dignity befitting 
assemblymen? Fifty percent of the respondents said that only 
one-half of the assemblymen meets that qualification. More 
specifically, none picked "90 percent or more" as the proportion 
of assemblymen meeting that qualification; 15.3 percent picked 
"60 to 70 percent"; 34.7 percent picked "approximately 50 
percent"; 31.9 percent "about 30 percent," and 18.1 percent 
answered "less than 30 percent." 
  Next, the reporters were asked to grade individual 
assemblymen whom they know through their work. They were asked 
to pick five assemblymen in four categories--"assemblyman whose 
legislative activity is considered most vigorous," "assemblyman 
who is demonstrating qualities of a rational and democratic 
politician and is very likely to grow to be a superb 
politician," "assemblyman who seems to have the highest 
credibility among colleagues," and "assemblyman who engaged in 
parliamentary activity giving a negative impression (e.g., 
persons who made illogical, slanderous, irresponsible or stupid 
remarks)." 
  It is assumed that their grading of individual assemblymen 
were influenced by their experiences in official and unofficial 
coverage activities and by their personal likings. However, the 
tally showed a clear-cut trend in the choice of the respondents, 
in particular with the ten lawmakers who received most votes. 
  The top ten assemblymen picked by the 72 political reporters 
for most contributions to legislative activities are: 
  (1) Yi Hae-chan (41, DP; Kwanak-B, Seoul; 34 votes); (2) Yi 
Sok-hyon (43, DP; Anyang-B, Kyonggi; 32 votes); (3) Kim Won-kil 
(51, DP; Tobong-B, Seoul; 27 votes); (4) Kim Won-ung (49, DP; 
Taedok, Taejon; 22 votes); (5) Kang Chang-song (65, DP; national 
constituency; 16 votes); (6) Yim Pok-chin (50, DP; West-B, 
Kwangju; 14 votes); (7) Sin Kye-ryun (39, DP; Songbuk-B, Seoul; 
14 votes); (8) Pak Sok-mu (50, DP; Muan, North Cholla; 13 
votes); (9) Pak Myong-hwan (55, DLP; Mapo-B, Seoul; 12 votes); 
(10) Son Hak-kyu (47, DLP; Kwangmyong, Kyonggi; 11 votes) 
  Yi Hae-chan, who won the most votes in the previous survey, 
retained his top place, followed by Yi Sok-hyon, a freshman 
assemblyman. Conspicuous is the rise of Son Hak-kyu who made the 
top ten only seven months after his election in an April 
by-election. The fact that the list includes as many as four 
former activists seems to point to the successful performances 
of the ex-activists since their move into the 
chedokwon [conservative camp]. It is noteworthy that 
those who had been active participants in the democratization 
movements until they were elected to the National Assembly are 
being favorably viewed as assemblymen, too. 
  Needless to say, some object to this observation. They 
contend that such ratings by reporters are more a propensity 
analysis than a political analysis. Their point is that the 
preconceived notions of reporters--who are hoping for an end to 
outdated political styles--would prompt them to take the side of 
those reformists who are in the same age bracket and share 
similar values with them. A reporter said: "For instance, 
dominant in 'Assembly Sketch'-type articles these days are 
comments by party executives and crusaders for clean politics. 
They carry no stories about the middle group." Young 
assemblymen's public relations strategy, he observed, appears to 
be working as a factor attracting young reporters. 
  Anyway, the top ten list seems to indicate that the former 
activists impressed the reporters with their image of diligence, 
while assemblymen like Kang Chang-song and Yim Pok-chin, both 
defense and foreign policy experts, and Kim Won-ung, who is a 
rare ex-businessman among opposition assemblymen, earned their 
high ratings by distinguishing themselves in their respective 
fields. Kim Won-kil, Pak Myong-hwan and Pak Sok-mun are also 
known for "diligence" in their parliamentary activities. 
  One thing to be noted is that except Yi Hae-chan and Pak 
Sok-mu, they are all freshman assemblymen. Of the top ten picked 
in the same category in the previous survey of the 13th National 
Assembly, six were reelected to the 14th National Assembly--Yi 
He-chan, Yi Chol, Pak Sok-mu, Cho Se-hyong, Kim Yong-chin, and 
Kim Won-ki. Of the six, only two made it this time. 
  The fact that the ratings on ruling party assemblymen are 
relatively low seems to have something to do with structural 
matters. Undoubtedly, it comes in part from the fundamental 
nature of the ruling party which is basically the government 
party. In addition, before proceedings begin in the National 
Assembly, ruling party assemblymen are already required to 
comply with decisions made in the party-government consultation 
processes; as a result, they naturally cannot be as offensive as 
opposition assemblymen. Nowadays, some ruling party assemblymen 
criticize the government and present alternative policies like 
opposition assemblymen do. But the survey found that their 
activities are not forceful enough to impress the reporters. 
With all these things taken into consideration, the fact that 
only two DLP assemblymen are ranked among the top ten still 
seems to point to the need for redoubled efforts on the part of 
ruling party assemblymen. 
  From the national constituency, which is of the nature of 
professional representation in that it gives specialists in 
specific fields an opportunity to be elected to the National 
Assembly, only Kang Chang-song made the top ten, a fact 
indicative of how active national constituency assemblymen are 
in their legislative activities. 
  The tally also included the following results: 
  10 votes: Che Chong-ku (DP); 9 votes: Kim Yong-chin (DP), 
Pak 
Sang-chon (DP); 8 votes: Pak Kye-tong (DP), Pak Chong-ung (DLP); 
5 votes: Kang Sam-chae (DLP), Kang Su-rim (DP), Kim Hyong-o 
(DLP), Na Pyong-son (DP), Yim Chae-chong (DP), Chang Chun-ik 
(DP), Han Hwa-kap (DP); 4 votes: Kang Kyong-sik (DLP), Kim 
Pyong-o (DP), Pak Pom-chin (DLP), Song Tu-ho (DLP), Chong 
Kyun-hwan (DP); 3 votes: Kim Chung-wi (DLP), Pak Chu-chon (DLP), 
Yi Pu-yong (DP); 2 votes: Kang Chae-sop (DLP), Kim Yong-il 
(DLP), Kim Chung-cho (DP), Na O-yon (DLP), Pak Chi-won (DP), Pak 
Hon-ki (DLP), Paek Nam-chi (DLP), Song Chon-yong (DLP), Won 
Hye-yong (DP), Yu In-tae (DP), Yi Kyu-taek (DP), Yi Yun-su (DP), 
Chong Sang-yong (DP) 
  The number of assemblymen who received two or more votes was 
44 or 14.7 percent of the 299 total number of assemblymen. 
Meanwhile, 24 assemblymen got one vote each. This means that 68 
assemblymen--22.7 percent of the total number of 
assemblymen--impressed the reporters with their legislative 
activities. Assemblymen who received a single vote are: Kim 
Yong-kwang, Kim Yong-ku, Kim Pyong-il, Kim Un-hwan, Kim In-yong, 
Kim Hae-sok, No Sung-u, Mun Chong-su, Mun Hui-sang, Pak 
Kwang-tae, Pak Il, Pak Tae-yong, So Sang-mok, Sin Ki-ha, Sin 
Sun-pom, Yi Kon-yong, Yi Ho- chong, Yi Hwan-ui, Chong Tae-chol, 
Cho Se-hyong, Cho Sun-hyong, Cho Il- hyon, Cha Su-myong, Choe 
Yong-han. 
<H5>  Yi Pu-yong Picked as Most Promising </H5>
  The second question was about the future of individual 
assemblymen. While the first question was about the 
"accomplishments" to date, this one was about the "potential." 
Yi Pu-yong was found leading overwhelmingly in this category. 
The top ten are: 
  (1) Yi Pu-yong (51, DP; Kangdong-A, Seoul; 51 votes); (2) Yi 
Hae-chan (41, DP; Kwanak-B, Seoul; 26 votes); (3) Son Hak-kyu 
(47, DLP; Kwangmyong, Seoul; 19 votes); (4) Kang Chae-sop (46, 
DLP; West-B, Taegu; 13 votes); (5) Che Chong-ku (49, DP; 
Kwangmyong, Sihung, Kyonggi; 15 votes); (6) Kang Sam-chae (41, 
DLP; Hoewon,, Masan; 13 votes); (6) Kim Tok-yong (52, DLP; 
Socho-B, Seoul; 13 votes); (8) Yi Hyop (52, DP; Iri, North 
Cholla; 9 votes); (9) Chong Tae-chol (49, DP; Chung, Seoul; 8 
votes); (9) Han Hwa-kap (56, DP; Sinan, South Cholla; 8 votes) 
  It is recalled here that Yi Pu-yong, pressing for new 
politics as a leader of the reformist group in the DP, received 
only three votes in the category of "accomplishments." Equally 
noteworthy is the fact that Kim Tok-yong, who received not a 
single vote in that category, and Chong Tae-chol, who received 
only one vote in the same, were respectively ranked in the 6th 
and 9th spot in this category about how promising individual 
assemblymen are. 
  The landslide for Yi Pu-yong can be attributed to the fact 
that the assemblyman whose name was already a synonym for reform 
has successfully adapted himself to real politics, and that he 
is one of the reform leaders in the National Assembly. It seems 
that reporters gave Yi Hae-chan, Son Hak-kyu, Che Chong-ku and 
Yi Hyop high points for their potential as reformists. As for 
DLP spokesman Kang Chae-sop, ranked in the fourth place, he and 
reporters find congeniality in each other for the age factor. 
Moreover, he is one of the most clear-headed and brilliant. 
These things and his successful move to the YS [Kim Yong-sam] 
group apparently brought him high ratings in this category. 
  Kim Tok-yong, first minister of state, and Chong Tae-chol 
are 
respectively viewed as the ruling and opposition party champion 
of the new generation. Kang Sam-chae is deeply involved in the 
reform program of the DP as a real power of the RDP [former 
Reunification Democratic Party] faction; in addition, his age 
seems to make him a promising assemblyman. These factors must 
have been taken into account. As for Han Hwa-kap, reporters 
apparently considered the fact that he is seen as the next 
representative of the Tonggyo-tong faction "vacated by Kim 
Tae-chung." People say that the way Han Hwa-kap is acting these 
days makes them think of Kim Tae-chung, stirring nostalgia among 
them. 
  The following is the tally on other assemblymen in this 
category: 
  7 votes: Sin Kye-ryun (DP), Yi Chol (DP), Hong Sa-tok (DP); 
6 
votes: Kim Won-kil (DP), So Sang-mok (DLP); 5 votes: Pak Sok-mu 
(DP), Cho Se-hyong (DP); 4 votes: Kim Won-ki (DP), Paek Nam-chi 
(DLP), Yu Chun-sang (DP), Yi Ki-taek (DP), Yi Sok-hyon (DP), Han 
Kwang-ok (DP); 3 votes: Kim Yun-hwan (DLP), Kim Yong-o (DLP), 
Mun Hui-sang (DP), Pak Kye-tong (DP), Pak Sang-chon (DP), Pak 
Chong-ung (DLP), Pak Chi-won (DP), Pak Hon-ki (DLP), Yi In-che 
(DLP); 2 votes: Kang Chang-hui (independent), Kim Won-ung (DP), 
Kim Yong-il (DLP), Kim Chung-wi (DLP), Kim Chung-cho (DP), Na 
Ung-pae (DLP), Pak Myong-hwan (DLP), Pak Pom-chin (DLP), Won 
Hye-yong (DP), Yim Chae-chong (DP), Chong Kyun-hwan (DP), Chong 
Sang-yong (DP), Choe Chae-uk (DLP) 
  Altogether, 45 assemblymen or 15 percent of the entire 
assemblymen received two or more votes. Meanwhile 33 received 
one vote each and they were: Kang Su-rim, Kang In-sop, Kim 
Sang-hyon, Kim Yong-ku, Kim Chong-ho, Na O-yon, No Chae-pong, 
Pak Kyong-su, Pak Sil, Pak Un-tae, Pak Chong-hun, Pak Chu- chon, 
Pak Chan-chong, So Hun, Son Se-il, Song Chon-yong, Sin Ki-ha, 
Sin Sang-u, O Chong-sop, Yi Kil-chae, Yi Man-sop, Yi Sun-chae, 
Yi Yong-sam, Chang Sok-hwa, Chang Chae-sik, Chong Mong-chun, Cho 
Pu-yong, Cho Sun- hyong, Cho Yong-chang, Choe Pyong-yol, Choe 
Hyong-u, Ho Kyong-man, Hwang Nak-chu. 
  The third question was about credibility among colleagues. 
Yi 
Pu-yong topped the list in this category, too. Unlike in other 
categories, more senior party leaders made the top ten. Another 
characteristic point was that votes were more scattered. The 
following are the top ten and ties (13 in total): 
  (1) Yi Pu-yong (51, DP; Kangdong-A, Seoul; 22 votes); (2) 
Kim 
Yun-hwan (61, DLP; Sinsan, Kunwi, Kyonggi; 16 votes); (3) Yi 
Man-sop (61, DLP; national constituency; 11 votes); (3) Yi Hyop 
(52, DP; Iri, North Cholla; 11 votes); (5) Che Chong-ku (49, DP; 
Kwangmyong, Sihung, Kyonggi; 10 votes); (6) Cho Se-hyong (62, 
DP; Songdong-B, Seoul; 9 votes); (6) Kim Won-ki (56, DP; 
Chongju, Chongup, North Cholla; 9 votes); (8) Kang Chae-sop (46, 
DLP; West-B, Taegu; 7 votes); (9) Yi Hae-chan (41, DP; Kwanak-B, 
Seoul; 6 votes); (9) Chong Tae-chol (49, DP; Chung, Seoul; 6 
votes) (9) Cho Sun-sung (64, DP; Sungju, South Cholla; 6 votes); 
(9) Choe Hyong-u (58, DLP; Tongnae-B, Pusan; 6 votes); (9) Kan 
Kwang-ok (52, DP; Kwanak-A, Seoul; 6 votes) 
  That an assemblyman enjoys high credibility among colleagues 
can be interpreted in a variety of ways. First, it suggests that 
he is sociable and is respected. It could also mean that he is 
practicing politics on the basis of debate and compromise. Those 
listed among the top ten are mostly known for their relatively 
modest and reasonable lines. 
  In this sense, the fact that assemblymen like Yi Pu-yong, Yi 
Hyop, Che Chong-ku and Yi Hae-chan are ranked high in this 
category disproves, in effect, the common knowledge that 
ex-activists who are "making important contributions to 
legislative activities and considered promising assemblymen" are 
usually not rated as high in the "credibility among assemblymen" 
category. At the same time, it carries a lesson to assemblymen 
who are the subjects of criticism that their excessive elitism 
and radical style are alienating themselves from colleagues. 
  Kim Yun-hwan of the DLP, ranked second in the top ten, is 
reportedly in an ill mood these days because of Yu Song-hwan of 
the RDP faction in the same party, who attempted to make an 
issue of his past record. He has continued to move up the ladder 
since the Yusin era [under President Pak Chong-hui] and is 
currently expected to play a "godfather" role for the DJP 
[former Democratic Justice Party] faction which is under the 
pressure of the RDP faction. The high ratings of his popularity 
among assemblymen seem to reflect the perceived "hopes" of the 
DJP faction as well as the affability of Kim Yun-hwan himself. 
  Speaker Yi Man-sop came, conspicuously, in the third place. 
The ratings for him seem to reflect sentiments of assemblymen 
pinning their hopes on his declaration that "a speaker of the 
National Assembly should never allow himself to be influenced by 
Chongwadae" and that "while I am the speaker, there will be no 
railroading by surprise." As for Kang Chae-sop, DLP spokesman, 
it is observed that his deft handling of personal relationships 
led to the ratings. 
  Ratings for other assemblymen: 
  5 votes: Kim Tok-kyu, Yi Han-tong; 4 votes: Kim Pyong-o, Pak 
Chol-on, Sin Sun-pom, Yu In-tae, Yi Chol, Cho Sun-hyong, Hwang 
Nak-chu; 3 votes: Kang Sam-chae, Kim Chong-ho, Kim Chung-wi, Kim 
Chin-chae, Kim Tae-sik, Na Ung-pae, Pak Sok-mu, Pak Hon-ki, Sin 
Kyong-sik, Sin Sang-u, Choe Chae-uk, Han Hwa-kap; 2 votes: Kang 
Chang-song, Kang Chang-hui, Kim Tok-yong, Kim Pyong-o, Kim 
Yong-ku, Kim Won-kil, Kim Won-ung, Kim Chung-cho, Pak Kyong-su, 
Pak Sang-chon, Pak Hui-tae, Paek Nam-chi, Son Hak-kyu, O Se-ung, 
Yi Sang- tuk, Yi Song-ho, Yi Chun-ku, Yim Pok-chin, Chang 
Chun-ik, Chang Chae- sik, Chong Pil-kun, Hwang Nak-chu. 
  Altogether, 57 assemblymen received two or more votes, while 
48 received one vote each. 
  In the above three categories, Yi Hae-chan is the only 
assemblyman who made the top ten in all of them. He topped the 
list in the "legislative activity" category, in the second place 
in the "promising assemblyman" category, and in the ninth in the 
"credibility" category. Meanwhile, in Yi Pu-yong's case, he 
emerged at the top in two categories but fell way behind in the 
"legislative activity." Other assemblymen who made the top ten 
in two categories are: Son Hak-kyu ("promising" and "legislative 
activity"), Kang Chae-sop, Yi Hyop, Che Chong-ku, and Chong 
Tae-chol ( "promising" and "credibility"). 
  The fourth question was who the reporters think are misfits 
as assemblyman. In this category, 101 assemblymen received one 
or more votes. (The number of them who received two votes or 
more was 57.) Of the top ten, seven were DLP assemblymen, two 
DP, and one UPP [United People's Party]. The first place went to 
Rep. "B" of North Kyongsang (DLP, 27 votes), followed by Rep. 
"B" of South Chungchong (DLP, 18 votes), Rep. "Y" of the 
national constituency (DLP, 18 votes), Rep. "J" of North 
Chungchong (DP, 14 votes), Rep. "J" of Kyonggi (UPP, 13 votes), 
Rep. "K" of North Kyongsang (DLP, 12 votes), Rep. "Y" of the 
national constituency (DLP, 9 votes), Rep. "K" of North 
Kyongsang (DLP, 8 votes), Rep. "P" of Seoul (DP, 8 votes), and 
Rep. "J" of Taegu (DLP, 7 votes). 
  Such being their ratings of the 14th National Assembly, what 
do the reporters see as its problems? The survey found 48.6 
percent (35 persons) citing "the lack of vision in leading the 
civilian government era" as the biggest problem, followed by 
22.2 percent (16 persons) picking "the National Assembly Law and 
the way it is being steered," 18.1 percent (13 persons) accusing 
the legislature of being swayed too much by the party interests, 
and 11.1 percent (8 persons) charging that assemblymen are 
preoccupied with the interests of their constituencies and of 
themselves. 
  In the previous survey, 58.6 percent of the respondents saw 
"political activities swayed by the party interests" as the 
biggest problem of the 13th National Assembly. The lower 
percentage this time is interpreted as the public demand for a 
legislature worthy of the civilian government era has been 
overwhelming. Both at the time of its launching and during the 
recent regular session, it demonstrated the lingering old 
practices. Reporters are of the opinion that they will very 
likely be compelled to highlight the same unresolved problems 
again. 
  The reporters were also asked what they felt while watching 
assemblymen's parliamentary activities. To this question, 34.7 
percent (25 persons) pointed out that "the levels of individual 
assemblymen should improve," while 29.2 percent (21 persons) 
noted that "political parties should be democratized" and 8.3 
percent (6 persons) cited the need for amendments to the 
National Assembly Law and for reasonable management of 
parliament. Those who cited the need for solution to the 
political fund issue were only 2 persons (2.8 percent). This 
indicates that as far as reporters are concerned, they had drawn 
the conclusion that in order for the National Assembly and its 
members to act as they should, assemblymen and political parties 
have to change, and that there are no other ways after all. 
  To the question concerning influences affecting 
parliamentary 
activities of the 14th National Assembly, 32 persons (44.4 
percent) picked media, followed by 22 persons (30.6 percent) 
citing party leadership, and 13 persons (18.1 percent) naming 
the administration. It was confirmed that of the respondents who 
named the administration, many included Chongwadae. In the 
previous survey, 54.3 percent cited party leadership and 27.8 
percent media. 
  As politicians exposed to public scrutiny, it is quite 
natural that assemblymen are sensitive to media. Hence, the joke 
that "assemblymen and reporters are the kings in the assembly 
hall." 
  Only two reporters picked constituents and public 
organizations as the major influence on the National Assembly. 
(One reporter made no response.) The survey found that there are 
virtually no other major influences affecting assemblymen. This 
is viewed as meaning that the authority and status of the 
assemblyman is that high. 
  Currently, political parties represented in the National 
Assembly are the DLP, DP, UPP, the New Korea Party and the 
Sinjong Party. The reporters were asked which party they think 
has been most effective in the bargaining in the 14th National 
Assembly. The result: 72.2 percent (52 persons) picked the DP 
and 20.8 percent (15 persons) the DLP, while two cited the 
independents but not a single reporter paid attention to the 
UPP, the Sinjong Party or the New Korea Party. Meanwhile, three 
reporters wrote in a separate pick, "I see no party befitting 
this category." 
  To evaluate the National Assembly and individual assemblymen 
is not an easy task. It requires comprehensive analyses of all 
remarks in the parliament by the assemblyman, his legislative 
and social activities, as well as the role he plays inside his 
party. Needless to say, the work requires fairly high levels of 
professional knowledge. Also, for the fairest possible ratings, 
it is necessary to consider evaluations by related people, too. 
  Before this type of full-scale evaluations are attempted, we 
have shown you the appraisals by the reporters assigned to the 
coverage of the National Assembly, political parties and 
individual assemblymen. Needless to say, their evaluations are 
of undeniable importance. As we said earlier, they cover 
political developments live and therefore are considered fit for 
the task. Therein lies the significance of this survey, we 
believe. 
  Anyhow, it is expected that the full-scale evaluations of 
the 
14th National Assembly will be carried out in late 1995 in 
advance of the 1996 general election for the 15th National 
Assembly. What we have presented are a kind of interim 
evaluations. The results so far seem to point to a mixture of 
potential hopes and disappointments. Our parliament and its 
members undoubtedly have their problems but it is also true that 
there is an effort under way for a rebirth and that we have fine 
assemblymen with gifts, capabilities and excellent political 
records. For all this, we feel that we can pin our hopes on the 
14th National Assembly. 
  Moreover, along with the foregone conclusion that to have a 
National Assembly is better than having none, there is the 
national consensus that our legislature should develop further 
in the future. For this fact, too, we can attach our hopes to 
the future of the 14th National Assembly.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 5 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States remained apart Wednesday [5 January] after two days of 
working-level negotiations on Japanese Government procurements 
of U.S. telecommunications equipment, sources close to the 
Japanese side said. 
  Telecoms is one of the four priority areas in ongoing 
bilateral trade framework talks. The negotiators are scheduled 
to wind up their discussions before February 11, when Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
meet to assess the entire talks. 
  According to the sources, this week's discussions centered 
on 
how to determine objective criteria in the telecoms field to 
measure any progress. 
  The U.S. asked Japan to use the average market share of 
foreign products in other developed nations as the objective 
criteria, but Japan did not agree, they said. They said the 
U.S. is looking for indicators which can be used to measure 
concrete progress, but Japan is concerned that such indicators 
would be regarded as targets to which it would be required to 
meet. 
  If the working-level negotiators cannot come closer to 
agreement on the issue, the decision may have to be left to 
subcabinet-level talks, the sources said. 
  They said the negotiators also discussed whether purchases 
by 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. and other large 
organizations should be included in the category of the 
government procurement, but no agreement was reached on this 
point either.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata said Thursday [6 December] he has not yet been fully 
informed of an agreement between the United States and North 
Korea on the latter's acceptance of international inspections of 
all seven of its declared nuclear facilities. 
  Hata was speaking to reporters after a morning cabinet 
meeting in the wake of a senior U.S. official's remarks 
Wednesday that North Korea has agreed to accept inspections by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The foreign minister said he nevertheless hopes that the 
U.S.-North Korean talks will result in Pyongyang's staying in 
the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and accepting 
inspections. Asked if progress on that score would lead to a 
resumption of talks between Japan and North Korea on 
normalization of diplomatic relations, Hata said he hopes that 
will be the case. 
  U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis told reporters in 
Washington on Wednesday of the agreement with North Korea. 
Davis said the IAEA will be holding talks shortly with North 
Korea to work out procedures to carry out inspections of the 
seven declared nuclear sites. 
  The announcement capped seven months of secret negotiations 
between Washington and Pyongyang over the nuclear inspection 
issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- North Korea's suspected 
nuclear weapons development and Japan's plan to shorten its aid 
programs for China are high on the agenda for talks between 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Chinese leaders during his 
weekend visit to Beijing, officials said Thursday [6 January]. 
  Hata, also deputy prime minister, will hold separate talks 
on 
Saturday with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Premier 
Li Peng, and will meet President and Communist Party General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin on Sunday before returning to Tokyo later 
in the day. 
  Talks between Hata and Qian, who met twice last year -- in 
New York in late September and again in Seattle in November -- 
will cover bilateral and international affairs, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  The two foreign ministers will discuss the situation on the 
Korean peninsula as well as problems concerning North Korea's 
suspected development of nuclear weapons, the officials said. 
  Japan is likely to call on China to urge Pyongyang to accept 
international inspections of its nuclear facilities, since 
Beijing has the "largest official channel" with Pyongyang, they 
said. 
  In talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Seattle, 
Jiang pledged that Beijing will use its influence with Pyongyang 
"on the plus side" and would not exert influence that could turn 
into "a minus." 
  Hata may also urge China to agree to a comprehensive ban on 
nuclear testing, the officials said. 
  Japan wants China to engage in negotiations expected to 
begin 
this year in Geneva on a treaty for a global ban on nuclear 
testing. 
  China conducted an underground nuclear test in October 
despite Qian's speech at the United Nations General Assembly in 
September to open test ban talks as early as possible. 
  Hata is expected to voice Japan's support for China's bid to 
join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the 
officials said. 
  Hata and Qian will also discuss the two nations' roles in 
the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, review APEC's 
activities and also discuss the upcoming Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional forum, they said. 
  On bilateral issues, Hata will tell Qian about Japan's new 
aid programs for China after the current five-year loan program 
winds up at the end of fiscal 1995, in March 1996, they said. 
  According to ministry sources, Japan plans to shorten the 
duration of the aid programs from the current five or six years 
to three years starting in fiscal 1996. Japan has extended 
yen-denominated loans to China under five- or six-year programs 
since 1979, making China the only yen loan recipient under a 
program lasting more than one year. 
  China has been reluctant to accept a single-year program 
because it follows multiyear economic planning, the sources 
said. Under the current 1990-1995 loan program, Japan is 
extending 528.2 billion yen to finance 42 Chinese projects. 
  Hata and Qian may also discuss plans to conclude a bilateral 
treaty on the environment, which would enable Japanese and 
Chinese experts to conduct a joint survey on acid rain and other 
environmental problems, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- Japan and South Korea will 
send a joint survey team to Russia's Sakhalin Island next week 
to find out how many South Koreans left there after World War II 
want to permanently return to their homeland, the Foreign 
Ministry said Thursday [6 January]. 
  The joint team will go to Sakhalin for three days from 
Monday 
in line with an agreement reached in November between South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam and Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa in Kyongju, South Korea. 
  During the talks, Kim asked Japan to help in arranging the 
temporary or permanent return of Koreans who were forcibly taken 
by the Japanese authorities to Sakhalin before and during World 
War II and were left behind when Japan evacuated the island as 
Soviet troops advanced. 
  An estimated 150,000 Koreans were forcibly moved to 
Sakhalin, 
the southern half of which was ruled by Japan from 1905 until 
the end of the war. More than 40,000 still live on the island. 
  The Japanese team will be made up of officials from the 
Foreign Ministry and the Japanese Red Cross Society, the 
ministry said. 
  The members of the joint survey team will hold talks with 
officials of the Sakhalin government and concerned organizations 
to determine the number of South Koreans wishing to return to 
South Korea, it said.

  [Text] Brussels, Jan. 5 KYODO -- The European Union (EU) 
has officially abolished discriminatory curbs adopted by some of 
its member states against some import items from Japan, Japanese 
Government sources in Brussels said Wednesday [5 January]. 
  The 12-nation union agreed in December to scrap import 
quotas 
on 44 Japanese-made items imposed by France, Italy, Spain, 
Portugal and Greece. The 44 items include cars, automotive 
components, motorcycles, fruit juice and natural honey. 
  The import restrictions on about half of them had already 
been dropped separately by the five countries, so the EU 
decision affects 24 products which were still subject to 
restrictions. 
  The sources said the EU also agreed to end discriminatory 
treatment of imports from other members of the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and countries in Central and 
Eastern Europe.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- Japan hopes for "stable" 
movements of the yen in foreign currency trading, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Thursday [6 January]. 
  "Exchange rates are a reflection of economic fundamentals, 
and therefore their stable movements are desirable," the top 
government spokesman said at a news conference. But he declined 
further comment, saying the matter should be up to the currency 
market. 
  Citing the German mark's weakness vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar, 
Takemura said the yen is not necessarily easing but the American 
currency is firming. 
  Since the turn of the year, the dollar has been trading 
above 
113 yen in world currency markets. It opened Tokyo dealings on 
Thursday at 113.33 yen, up 0.21 yen from Wednesday's close.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- Farm Minister Eijiro Hata 
said Thursday [6 January] the price of foreign rice imported as 
an emergency measure will be determined after giving due 
consideration to the gap in quality with domestically produced 
rice. 
  Hata told a press conference after the year's first cabinet 
meeting that the government intends to set the price at levels 
which can meet consumers' demand for less expensive rice. The 
price of domestic rice "will be the yardstick" for that of 
foreign rice, he said. 
  Hata added a ministry panel, the Rice Price Council, will be 
called soon to give its views. 
  Japan plans to import a total of 1.9 million tons of rice by 
the end of March. The imports, the first in a decade, were 
forced by poor harvests last year -- the worst of the postwar 
period -- due to the unusually wet and cool summer.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii dismissed reports Thursday [6 January] that a new economic 
package may be further delayed, and reaffirmed the government's 
plan to compile it by around the middle of this month. Fujii 
said there was no change in the timing of the package which 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa instructed Economic Planning 
Agency Director General Manae Kubota late last year to compile 
by "around mid-January." 
  Reports of a possible delay in the package circulated after 
the fourth gathering Thursday of ministers and coalition parties 
leaders to discuss economic problems failed to come up with a 
timetable. "I didn't get such a nuance" from the meeting, Fujii 
said, adding that the mood was to decide on the schedule. 
  Concerning an income tax cut which is reportedly the major 
issue in the discussions, Fujii said that a decision on whether 
or not to include it in the new package has not been made but 
will come by mid-January, as Hosokawa pledged to the Diet. 
  Asked about the dollar-yen rate, Fujii declined to comment 
on 
remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sounding a 
warning on the yen's recent setback against the dollar. 
  Fujii said the finance ministers of the Group of Seven 
industrial nations agreed in September that exchange rates 
should reflect economic fundamentals. 
  The agreement "has not changed and should not be changed," 
Fujii said, adding that he is "closely watching the market 
situation." 
  Bentsen said Wednesday that "allowing the yen to slide is 
not 
an acceptable way out of recession for Japan." His comment 
followed remarks by a Japanese Government official, speaking 
anonymously, who called for a rate of 115 yen to the dollar 
because a cheaper yen would have a "favorable impact" on the 
Japanese economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- The Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry has asked the Finance Ministry to 
force commercial banks to disclose details of their fund 
operations concerning demand deposits, Postal Ministry officials 
said Thursday [6 January]. The request was made in connection 
with the scheduled liberalization of interest rates on ordinary 
postal savings, equivalent to bank demand deposits, within this 
year. 
  The Finance Ministry says that after liberalization, the 
interest rate on ordinary postal savings should be based on 
demand deposit interest rates, which are lower. 
  In that case, the postal ministry says, the banks should be 
required to disclose detailed information on their demand 
deposit fund operations. 
  Currently, the annual interest rate on ordinary postal 
savings is set at 1.32 percent, while that on bank demand 
deposits is 0.22 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- The country's multimedia 
market will be worth 123 trillion yen in the year 2010 if the 
telecommunications infrastructure is improved, Posts and 
Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki said Thursday [6 
January]. Unveiling a "vision" for Japan's policies for the 
information and telecom industries in the 21st century, Kanzaki 
told a press conference after this year's first cabinet meeting 
that the market has the potential to create 2.4 million jobs by 
that year. 
  Kanzaki's estimates are based on an assumption that every 
household in Japan is equipped with optical fibers, capable of 
transmitting light which can carry far more information than 
traditional copper wire. 
  The nation's fast-growing multimedia market had a scale of 
16 
trillion yen in 1990. Multimedia is the communicating of 
information in more than one form and includes the use of text, 
audio, graphic, animated graphic, and full-motion video formats. 
  The minister said the government needs to take various 
measures to nurture multimedia and other information and telecom 
industries, seen as one of the key sectors for the future 
Japanese economy. He cited improvement of the information and 
telecom infrastructure, promotion of new businesses, lessening 
segregation between the telecommunications and broadcasting 
sectors, and international collaboration as the chief goals for 
the government. 
  In detail, Kanzaki said the telecommunications council, an 
advisory body to the posts and telecom minister, plans to come 
up with proposals on the problem of infrastructure. 
  Proposed new businesses include English-language FM 
broadcasting, which foreign residents have been requesting, he 
said. Also considered is greater exchanges of information with 
the United States and the European Union on regulations for 
these sectors.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- The government decided at a 
cabinet meeting on Thursday [6 January] to set up an emergency 
task force to tackle the job situation in Japan, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said. The task force, headed by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, will hold its first meeting on 
Thursday evening to discuss possible agenda items and a 
timetable for its activities, the top government spokesman told 
a news conference. 
  The establishment of a government team on employment is the 
first since 1986 under the administration of Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro Nakasone, when the nation was smarting from a sharp 
appreciation of the Japanese yen against the dollar. 
  The task force comprises all cabinet ministers except for 
the 
justice minister. Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata was appointed acting head of the body. 
  Deputy heads of the body are Economic Planning Agency Chief 
Manae Kubota, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International 
Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, Labor Minister 
Chikara Sakaguchi, Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato and Takemura. 
  Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the eight million-strong 
Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), has been seeking the 
establishment of a government task force on employment as the 
nation's job situation is rapidly worsening. 
  Government reports show the ratio of job openings to job 
seekers fell to a seasonally adjusted 0.65 in November, off 0.02 
percentage point from October, while the nation's unemployment 
rate in the month climbed to a seasonally adjusted 2.8 percent, 
up 0.1 percentage point.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 6 KYODO -- A new government task force 
headed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa held its first 
meeting Thursday [6 January] to discuss ways to overcome the 
severe employment situation in Japan, Deputy Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Yukio Hatoyama said. The 30-minute meeting at the 
prime minister's official residence opened with a briefing by a 
Labor Ministry official on the current employment situation 
followed by discussion, Hatoyama told a news conference. 
  The official cited some depressing data on the nation's job 
situation, including recent government reports showing the ratio 
of job openings to job seekers fell to 0.65 in November, off 
0.02 percentage point from October, while the nation's 
unemployment rate in the month rose 0.1 percentage point to 2.8 
percent, the highest since August 1987. 
  The task force comprises the entire cabinet except for the 
justice minister. Foreign minister and deputy prime minister 
Tsutomu Hata serves as acting head of the body. 
  Deputy heads of the body are Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura, Economic Planning Agency (EPA) Chief Manae 
Kubota, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International Trade and 
Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, Labor Minister Chikara 
Sakaguchi and Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato. 
  At the meeting, Hosokawa instructed the cabinet ministers 
present to do their utmost to secure employment for the sake of 
the public's welfare, Hatoyama said. 
  Some participants explained about their respective 
ministries' and agencies' efforts to tackle the job problems 
facing the nation, he added. 
  Education Minister Ryoko Akamatsu and Kubota of the EPA 
spoke 
of the need to ensure employment of female university graduates. 
Akamatsu was quoted as saying female university students' 
dissatisfaction with sexual discrimination should be removed. 
  Hatoyama told reporters that no specific timetable was set 
for the task force's activities. 
  It is the first government team on employment to be created 
since 1986 under Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, when the 
nation was again suffering from the yen's sharp appreciation 
against the dollar. 
  Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the eight million-member 
Japanese Trade Union Confederation (Rengo), has been seeking the 
establishment of a government task force on employment to cope 
with the nation's rapidly worsening job situation.

<F P=106> ["South Korean Puppets Must Act With Discretion" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- A few days ago, the 
South Korean puppet chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS] 
talked about "prompt retaliation" and "completion of military 
preparedness" against the North, and the puppet Army, Navy and 
Air chiefs of staff waxed eloquent about "looks of an invincible 
Army" and "establishment of emergency combat preparedness." 
  NODONG SINMUN today, commenting on that, says: The South 
Korean warlikers incited confrontation and war from the 
beginning of the year because they intend to continue to seek 
confrontation, not national unity and reconciliation, and make 
more vicious military adventures against the North on the ground 
and the sea and in the sky this year. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  It is ill-boding that the puppet military bosses of South 
Korea dared let out bellicose outcries from the beginning of the 
year. 
  What draws particular attention is that the South Korean 
puppets cried for "maintenance of firm relations of military 
cooperation" with the United States and "effective operation of 
the quick deployment deterrent force." 
  Thus, they revealed their intention to commit more 
undisguised criminal acts against fellow countrymen this year in 
collusion with outside forces. The traitorous nature of Kim 
Yong-sam hell-bent on doing harm to fellow countrymen in 
conspiracy with outside forces far from working for 
reunification through national reconciliation and unity has been 
brought to light from the beginning of the year. 
  If the puppets persist in confrontation and war like a puppy 
knowing no fear of a tiger, they will get nothing good.

  [Text] The Defense Production Committee under the 
Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan [Keidanren], which 
is organized by about 80 defense-related companies, released a 
200-page report in mid-December. The report carries a 
translated text of the theater missile defense (TMD) plan, which 
was released by the U.S. Defense Department in June 1993. 
  In view of trends in the post-Cold War period, the TMD is 
proposed as a regional defense system to replace the strategic 
defense initiative (SDI) plan. The United States is calling for 
Japan's cooperation in developing and purchasing the TMD system, 
and Japan is beginning to think seriously about it since it 
became obvious the DPRK (North Korea) is developing the "Nodong" 
missile with an effective range of 1,000 kilometers. Under such 
circumstances, the Keidanren Defense Production Committee has 
decided to study the U.S. proposal. 
  A senior official of a major electric appliance manufacturer 
noted the TMD plan is expected to awaken Japan's interest in 
better warning and control systems as well as defense missile 
systems, saying: "Japan's air defense system is intended for 
airplane attacks, and the nation is completely open to ballistic 
missiles. The TMD will be a chance to modernize the nation's 
capability to cope with missile attacks." 
  During his Tokyo visit in November, U.S. Secretary of 
Defense 
Les Aspin stated that Japan should contribute to the TMD project 
not only by offering its technology, but also by purchasing 
U.S.-made equipment. If so, the project would be unattractive 
to Japanese companies. 
  Japan decided to purchase airborne warning and control 
system 
(AWACS) late last year, and the purchase of four AWACS planes 
was incorporated in the 1993 and 1994 budgets; however, this 
suppressed expenditure for Japanese-made equipment. 
  Therefore, Managing Director Shozo Ojimi of 
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Limited showed a prudent 
attitude toward Japan's participation in the TMD project, 
saying: "It is questionable that we really have to join the TMD 
project thoughtlessly. We have to carefully study its 
technological merits, or we will just waste money." Also, a 
senior Defense Agency official said: "While the United States 
wants to use Japanese technology in the TMD, Japan's 
technological contribution to development of the missile system 
would be quite limited due to legal restrictions." 
  Some quarters express concern that, even if some sort of 
technological cooperation is possible, such Japan-U.S. projects 
may produce nothing but technological friction just like the 
joint project for development of Japan's next-generation support 
fighter (FSX).

  [Text] Nippon Steel Corporation [NSC] and other major 
Japanese steel makers plan to start full-scale exports of 
half-finished steel products to the United States beginning 
early next year. This is to respond to the shortage of steel 
materials in the United States, where the demand for steel is 
increasing with the economy's recovery. It is expected that the 
export volume will be about 400,000 tons in the first half of 
next year. The steel exports do not yield much profit, but 
Japanese makers seem to have no choice but to export them 
because the demand at home has dropped greatly. 
  They will export billet to be rolled into thin steel sheets 
and formed steel products. U.S. steel makers will process the 
billet into thin steel sheets to be used for car production and 
other purposes. Japanese steel makers exported about 100,000 
tons of steel a year to the United States in the late eighties 
despite the appreciation of the yen at the time. Recently, the 
volume of exports has fallen to about 1,000 tons. 
  As automobiles are selling satisfactorily, steel materials 
for the production of cars are now in short supply in the United 
States. In the latter half of the year, U.S. steel makers began 
to give orders for steel materials to Japanese counterparts one 
after another. 
  In Japan, the volume of crude steel production in the 
January-March period is expected to be 21.45 million tons, the 
smallest figure in 25 years. Considering the decrease in steel 
demand very serious at home, Japanese steel makers have decided 
to export to the United States. Although major steel makers are 
continuously promoting the reduction of production, they cannot 
cut back operations beyond certain limits. 
  Besides exports to the United States, the NSC will also 
export pig iron for casting production to electric furnace steel 
makers in South Korea and Taiwan.

  [Text] Urasoe and the Naha Defense Facilities 
Administration Bureau [NDFAB] have reached a secret verbal 
agreement on the relocation of Naha Military Port to Urasoe. 
This was disclosed on 27 December by a RYUKYU SHIMPO probe. 
  Former Urasoe Mayor Noboru Higa verbally promised Duchu 
Kobo, 
the former chief of NDFAB, to that effect; NDFAB appears to have 
kept this memo. The Foreign Ministry, the Defense Agency, and 
the Defense Facilities Administration Agency are said to be 
pressing Urasoe to accept relocation of Naha Military Port to 
the city. However, the actual relocation of the military port to 
the city would make it possible to link the military port 
directly with Makiminato Supply Depot (Camp Kinser), thereby 
further consolidating the military port rather than returning 
it. The secret verbal agreement will certainly draw a backlash 
from democratic organizations. 
  Answering an inquiry from RYUKYU SHIMPO about the secret 
verbal agreement, Urasoe Mayor Seiko Gibo admitted the existence 
of the secret verbal agreement. Commenting on the relocation of 
the military port to the city, he stated: "I have inherited the 
former mayor's municipal administration, but the relocation of 
the military port to our city is another question." In this 
way, he objects to the relocation. Some businessmen and 
politicians in the city have also whispered about the secret 
verbal agreement. 
  Naha is accusing Urasoe of committing itself to such a 
secret 
verbal agreement, saying: "Urasoe wharf is located in the Naha 
Port harbor area; the relocation of the military port to the 
wharf will only serve to consolidate the military port on 
Okinawa." 
  Meanwhile, NDFAB denies the existence of the secret verbal 
agreement, saying: "Seven or eight years ago Urasoe made an 
informal proposal in connection with the relocation of Naha 
Military Port, but the city has since taken no follow-up 
actions." 
  Urasoe is promoting the development project of western 
coastal regions, the most important development project for the 
city. The development project is designed to reclaim about 120 
ha [hectare] of coastal area north of the Okinawa Wholesale and 
Commercial Complex in Seishu, Urasoe. However, the coastal area 
faces coastal areas off Camp Kinser, areas which are designated 
by U.S. forces on Okinawa as restricted waters. These 
restricted waters stand in the way of reclamation. 
  All information RYUKYU SHIMPO has gathered indicates the 
"secret verbal agreement appeared aimed at swapping the U.S. 
forces' decision to lift restrictions on the waters for the 
relocation of Naha Military Port to Urasoe wharf." 
  NDFAB is said to have asked the Okinawa Prefectural 
Government to secure the 50-ha site, almost the same acreage as 
that of Naha Military Port, in return for the relocation of the 
military port. 
  The acreage exceeds the 40 ha Urasoe plans to reclaim under 
the first phase of the development project. Urasoe claims: 
"Even if we have constructed the wharf, civilians are largely 
restricted in using it."

  [Text] A meeting of the committee in charge of national 
intelligence policy was held at Government House yesterday. It 
was attended by representatives from the military, Interior, 
Foreign, Finance, and Commerce Ministries, the governor of the 
Bank of Thailand, and director of the National Intelligence 
Agency. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai presided over the meeting. 
  General Charan Kunlawanit, secretary general of the National 
Security Council [NSC], said in an interview at Government House 
after the meeting that there was a review of the country's 
security from the political, economic, scientific, and 
environmental points of view, both domestically and externally. 
The meeting studied guidelines on improving intelligence 
gathering and making the organization more effective in serving 
national interests. 
  The NSC secretary general said the situation around the 
country is not a security threat at present. Anyway, fighting 
along the border near Burma and Cambodia could affect the safety 
of the people there. On Cambodia, he said the continued 
fighting there showed that efforts by several countries to help 
Cambodia achieve peace did not work, and that there were still 
conflicts between factions in Cambodia. He said it is necessary 
to try to achieve a sense of unity for the Cambodian people. He 
believed the fighting would go on until the two Cambodian 
factions realize that the fighting does not contribute to the 
nation. Then, the Cambodian Government and the Khmer Rouge 
would agree to compromise over a fair share of benefits for the 
sake of national development.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
agreed to inspections of its seven declared nuclear facilities 
and to resume dialogue with South Korea, setting the stage for 
high-level Pyongyang-Washington talks soon, a State Department 
official said Wednesday. 
  Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis told a regular briefing 
that North Korea had agreed to allow the inspections necessary 
for the continuity of safeguards on its seven installations 
declared with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
Davis said she expects Pyongyang to talk with the IAEA to set 
specifics on the procedures. 
  North Korea and the United States "are very close to 
satisfying" the conditions for the third round of high-level 
talks, and the talks could open based on these two steps, Davis 
said. 
  North Korean Embassy officials did meet with the IAEA at its 
Vienna headquarters, but Agency Spokesman David Kyd said there 
were no proposals on Pyongyang's part on the inspections. 
  The embassy officials basically heard the IAEA's position 
and 
replied they will come back with the response after consulting 
with their government, Kyd said in a telephone interview. 
  The next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks will seek ways to 
completely solve all issues related to the nuclear situation 
including special inspection on two undeclared sites in North 
Korea.

  [Text] Berlin, Jan. 5 (YONHAP) -- North Korea had a 
working-level contact with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) on Wednesday [5 January], but there was no 
significant progress toward its acceptance of inspections, a 
diplomatic source in Vienna said by telephone Wednesday. A 
diplomat from the North Korean Embassy in Vienna met with an 
IAEA official in charge of the North Korean nuclear problem, but 
did not present his country's position on the problem, he said. 
The source said that he could not say there had been 
significant progress. 
  The North Korean diplomat just listened to the IAEA's 
position and opinion on the place and date for consultation on 
when and how the IAEA will inspect the nuclear sites, and did 
not say anything about Pyongyang's position, according to the 
source. 
  The diplomat said that he would notify the IAEA of 
Pyongyang's position after he received instructions, but given 
that North Korea agreed to allow nuclear inspections earlier in 
the day, detailed consultations between North Korea and the IAEA 
will take place this week, the source said. He said he expected 
progress toward inspection, including an agreement on a venue 
for negotiations, to be made soon. 
  IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that North Korea had not made 
any proposal or given any notification about official contacts 
or official consultations. 
  The IAEA's position was officially unchanged from the end of 
1993 except that positive progress was being realized in the 
North Korean-U.S. contacts, Meyer said.

  [Text] Declining Population 
  A review of the future of Japan's economy reveals a big pile 
of serious problems that can probably cause a weak-minded person 
to suffer a nervous breakdown. Let us deal with some of the 
representative problems. 
  The first problem is the conspicuous decline in the birth 
rate, and the number of births during the past 20 years has been 
reduced from 2 million to 1.2 million people. If the present low 
birth rate of 1.5 should continue, the population composition 
hereafter will suddenly shift in the direction of the aged and, 
moreover, the population will begin to decrease about 20 years 
from now. 
  In the year after next, the population of the labor force 
will begin to decrease, and 25 years later, the population of 
the aged over 65 years will constitute 25 percent of the 
country. When the number of working people decreases, it is only 
natural for one to suppose that economic growth will stop. At 
the same time, the social security expenditures will 
progressively increase because of the increase in the population 
of the aged, and if the transposition is made with the present 
tax system intact, the tax burden of the worker 30 years hence 
will likely be about 70 percent. At that time, the old people's 
welfare will probably be cut drastically, and along with it, a 
heavy consumers tax will probably have been introduced in order 
to equalize the tax burden. It seems likely that the era, in 
which everyone, both young and old, must lower the standard of 
living, is about to be realized in the not too distant future. 
  There is no way to protect against this, except either to 
increase the number of foreign workers or, as quickly as 
possible, to return the birth rate from the present 1.5 to close 
to 2.1. Sweden has succeeded in raising the birth rate from 1.6 
to as much as 2.14 through such child-care policies as granting 
maternity leave with pay until the child is a year and a half 
old, child-care allowance, reduced working hours until the child 
is eight years old, etc. 
  Under this system in Sweden, where by having just one of the 
two parents remain at home to babysit for a total of about two 
years, one person, who in the future will work for 45 years 
between the ages of 20 and 65, will emerge, and therefore, this 
is truly an advantageous calculation. 
  From the standpoint of economic statistics, Japan is a 
nation 
with an extremely high savings rate, but for the future, the 
number of young people who must shoulder Japan's economy has 
begun to decrease. Moreover, with the increase in the 
population of old people, consumption will increase more than 
savings and, therefore, the savings rate will unmistakably shift 
to a decline. If the working population should decrease and the 
savings rate should decline, Japan's economy will definitely 
enter a degenerative stage. 
<H5>  Lamentation of Trade Surplus </H5>
  The next problem is the expanding trade surplus. This means 
that the goods produced through hard work by the Japanese cannot 
be fully utilized domestically and have become surplus goods. 
When compared with the middle class of the United States and the 
former West Germany, the standard of living of the Japanese is 
woefully unequal. The workers of the metropolitan cities ride 
overcrowded streetcars and commute from faraway small homes for 
long hours. No decent resort areas are found in their 
surroundings. 
  If the trade surplus were to be spent domestically, the 
standard of living of the Japanese would improve spectacularly. 
The trade surplus for last year was about $130 billion. If an 
equivalent amount of goods were marketed domestically, it would 
be possible to complete two Tohoku bullet express railway lines 
and, in addition, to build seven Seto Grand bridges annually. 
And even all the homes in cities with a population of a million 
people could be renovated into mansions. 
  If wisely invested, a number of commuter bullet express 
railway lines and a network of freeways can be built on the 
periphery of the great metropolitan cities, and it would 
probably be possible for everyone to commute from the large 
residential districts located within the nearby countryside. And 
the idea of having the sewer systems in all parts of Japan 
completed and the water in the rivers and lakes purified can be 
realized. 
  In order to do so, forceful policies must be resorted to, 
such as restricting the private ownership rights of land or 
prioritizing its utilization if the objective is for public use; 
raising the cost of the private ownership of land by levying a 
land tax with a uniformly heavy tax rate or reforming the 
agricultural and fishery industries. Still, by raising the land 
tax rate, the taxable amount is not supposed to be high because 
land prices will decline. 
<H5>  Expansion of the International Burden </H5>
  The third problem is Japan's international position. The 
cold 
war structure has dissolved and the world has begun to move 
furiously toward the formation of a new order. For the United 
States, the objective of strengthening its anti-Soviet, 
anticommunist military organization has disappeared, and in its 
place, the focus of its policy is laid on strengthening its 
economic power in order to prepare its strength to manifest its 
leadership under the new order. The ills of the U.S. economy 
have appeared to be the two big deficits in finance and trade. 
The Clinton administration has resolved to reduce the financial 
deficits by a total of $500 billion in the next five years. It 
intends to accomplish this by increased taxation of business and 
the high income brackets, and through the reduction of military 
expenditures and subsidies. 
  The reduction of financial deficits will produce a 
deflationary effect on the economy. Trade expansion and 
reduction of imports are necessary in order to alleviate this 
effect. The U.S. Government is trying to reduce the trade 
deficit with a strong determination. At that time, the one to 
become the greatest target is Japan, which to the United States 
is the country with the greatest trade deficit. 
  At the recent U.S.-Japan summit meeting, Miyazawa rejected 
President Clinton's request of making the ratio of the 
international accounts surplus to the GNP below 5 percent in 
four or five years hence, but regarding the important industrial 
fields of automobiles and their components, space industry 
equipment, etc., they apparently agreed to decide on the open 
market of the numerical target value of each one. This means 
that, regarding the important fields, the Japanese government 
must assume the obligation of achieving the importing objectives 
that have been decided on. 
  The United States has forced unfair controls even against 
Japanese business, but apparently the Japanese government could 
not allude to them. Among the major unfair controls are the 
demand for self-imposed controls on exports to the United 
States, foreign investment controls in the United States, policy 
of prioritizing the purchase of domestic goods, place of origin 
controls of any business advancing into the United States, 
forcing the domestic production ratio, etc. 
  With the exception of oil-producing countries, Japan has an 
expansive export surplus in nearly all countries. This is true 
even with the United States. The United States is trying to 
prevent the increase of Japan's exports to the United States, is 
suppressing the activities of Japanese business in the United 
States, and, regarding the important industrial goods, is trying 
to ensure a part of Japan's market share. 
  Japan's best plan in countering these efforts is to expand 
the investments of the infrastructure, such as transportation, 
cities, homes, etc., through the reform of the land system or 
the withdrawal of various controls, and thereby reducing the 
trade surplus. But in reality, the plan is not possible. 
  If the trade surplus cannot be reduced on a large scale, a 
balance must be achieved by increasing capital exports. By this 
means, Japan's overseas activities can be stimulated, and as 
Japan's position in the world expands, then its international 
responsibility on a comparable basis will be demanded. Regarding 
the world's desired order for the future, Japan must establish 
its world strategy under a clear vision, endeavor in that 
direction and it must assume the economic burden for the above 
reasons. At times, the burden might become a political or 
military one. 
  Regrettably, the formation of this sort of vision is not 
possible in today's Japan. Already, despite Japan's 
international position being extremely high, it does not possess 
a world strategy. Despite the end of the cold war, the U.S. 
military forces are necessary for Japan. This is because North 
Korea might possess nuclear capability. In this situation, Japan 
is compelled to yield to the demands of the U.S. Government. If 
the worst happens, this situation might remain the same all 
through, even hereafter. 
<H3>  Will the Japanese Government Change Under These 
Circumstances? </H3>
  Come to think of it, Japan, indeed, has been playing a truly 
foolish role. We Japanese have reduced the number of children in 
our families, worked faithfully, and as a result, the goods we 
have produced cannot be utilized to the fullest and are exported 
abroad, and the people abroad, through high-quality Japanese 
goods, have been enjoying a convenient life. The foreign 
exchange derived from these goods is invested abroad, and it has 
served to expand employment and improve income, beginning with 
the East Asian countries, in the various foreign countries. 
  The standard of living of the Japanese people is really not 
outstandingly high and yet Japan has disbursed the largest 
amount of funds as overseas assistance, compared with the rest 
of the world. Japan donated $11 billion during the Persian Gulf 
war. 
  Despite all this, the fact is that Japan is not respected by 
the world. It appears that there are more countries critical of 
Japan. 
  The Japanese people are exasperated, but fortunately the 
world has changed recently and even the politics of Japan 
appears to be changing. As for the mechanism that checked the 
development of Japan's economy and the improvement of the 
standard of living, lowered the birth rate, and gave birth to 
the huge trade surplus, the expectation, although a mere trifle, 
that it might crumble has emerged. 
  Along with the end of the cold war, the need to fear 
socialism disappeared. And along with these developments, the 
basis for the existence of a dictatorial government in South 
Korea or Taiwan disappeared and both countries have changed to 
democratic governments. Even in Japan, the reason for the LDP's 
one-party rule disappeared. In the cold war order, the LDP, with 
one-party rule, strengthened military cooperation between the 
United States and Japan, while the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan fulfilled its function by curbing further involvement and 
rendered a sense of security to the people. 
  A long-term political regime is bound to deteriorate. Even 
the LDP control was not an exception. Under a long-term reign of 
38 years, various controls were strung within Japan's economic 
society and a system of protecting weak industries was built in. 
In that process, if the assertion was made that even the strong 
industries and even the strong persons are weak industries and 
weak persons, then that assertion went unchallenged. These types 
of industries and people functioned as the LDP's vote collecting 
machines. As a result, the landowner egotists, the regional 
egotists and the business world egotists masked their face of 
righteousness, and a society accepting them in their pomp and 
glory was formed. 
  At a time when Japan's economy was weak, the vertically 
oriented administration developed policies that considered even 
the smallest details and assisted in nurturing the infant 
industries and in promoting trade, but today Japan's economy and 
business are strong and the intervention or protection of the 
administration no longer became necessary. But despite becoming 
strong, the industries which are considered weak and the people 
who have asserted the various egotisms hope for excess benefits 
that can be fetched from the intervention of the vertically 
oriented administration. 
  Politicians protect old controls, establish new controls, 
then wisely adjust the coordination within the vertically 
oriented ministries and agencies, and collect fees from 
benefited groups, which are applied as political funds. In this 
manner, the collusive structure of 
politicians-businessmen-bureaucrats was formed and the 
corrupting phenomenon expanded. Under the one party rule 
organization, the extremely strong landowners' rights, the low 
rate of the fixed assets tax ratio, and the protection of 
agriculture, fishery, diverse retail and service industries 
continued, and the efficient utilization of land in Japan became 
impossible. 
  The standard of living of the weak people, who could not 
organize political pressure groups, hardly improved. Various 
problems, such as the heavy tax on the salaried workers, their 
destitute homes, the absence of long-term maternity leave with 
pay, the lowly social position of women, etc., remained. 
  As a result, the birth rate declined, the overpopulation of 
the metropolitan area advanced all the more, and the livelihood 
of the salaried workers' families, on the contrary, began to 
worsen. The depopulated areas kept depopulating. As a result of 
overprotection, rice cultivation is finally on the verge of 
collapsing. 
  The LDP's reason for existence as a one-party rule system 
has 
disappeared and, as a result of the successive expose of the 
decaying phenomenon of the politicians-businessmen-bureaucrats 
relationship, the LDP has fragmented, resulting in the formation 
of three new parties. The focal point of the election was 
political reform and the three new parties received strong 
support from the people. But regrettably, political reform 
signified first of all the revision of the election system, and 
following this, the subject of the transparency of political 
funds was to be raised. 
  However, there was no proposal for a determined policy that 
would eliminate the obstacles pressuring the favorable growth of 
Japan's economy and the improvement of the people's standard of 
living. The reason is that even the new parties, like the old 
party, are afraid of lashbacks from the pressure groups. For 
instance, all the political parties in Japan are regrettably 
opposed to the liberalization of rice. As a result, the Uruguay 
Round of talks ended in failure, the trend of protective trade 
gained strength, and there is no political party that will 
mention the fear of damage to Japan's economy becoming serious. 
And of course, none of them has expressed countermeasures to be 
taken when the time of damage occurs. Under these circumstances, 
there is no political reform. It is simply an act of "political 
change."

"The Way To Look at the `Non-LDP Coalition'"] 
  [Text] [Moderator] The Hosokawa cabinet has finally 
started, but the meaning of this upheaval is yet to be clearly 
understood. What is your view on this? 
  [Reporter C] The citizens and voters don't seem to 
understand 
the situation well, about what the non-Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] coalition government means and how it will develop in the 
future. This is a new situation for us, too. 
  [Reporter A] Television has something to do with it, also, 
stirring up momentary moods. Interesting, but it doesn't give us 
time to contemplate the essential issue; it only follows 
situational changes. 
  [Reporter C] A housewife called our political desk, and said 
that the public had never wanted a non-LDP coalition, and that 
she didn't expect this at all. 
  That program on NHK [Japan Broadcasting Corp.], which was 
aired for two days following the balloting, had considerable 
influence on the public, I think. It polled public opinion by 
telephone in real time as it aired a symposium of political 
parties. At that time, an overwhelming majority of the callers 
said, "We want a non-LDP coalition government." Having seen 
that, Hosokawa had to take up a "non-LDP" coalition, I think. 
  As things gradually calmed down, however, opinion surveys 
began to show recently that the majority of people "want a 
coalition with the LDP in it." This change shows that the public 
has begun to wonder "if the situation is right as it turned out." 
  [Moderator] What do you think of the members of the Hosokawa 
cabinet? 
  [Reporter A] Sankagetsu [this family name means "three 
months" in Japanese], a former dean of the law school at the 
University of Tokyo, was appointed as justice minister. They 
found a man with a really peculiar name. I thought that his name 
signified the destiny of the cabinet--an end in three months.... 
(laughter) Overall, the cabinet consists of the heads of six 
political parties, two civilians, and three women. Hata is the 
only one who had experience as a cabinet minister. The cabinet 
looks new as far as its form is concerned; it is quite different 
from what we saw in the past when the LDP factions took turns. 
The issue here is the ability to perform. Frankly, I think the 
cabinet looks poor in many respects. 
  [Reporter B] Prime Minister Hosokawa is quite shrewd in 
appointing the minister of home affairs and the minister in 
charge of political reform from the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ]. The most important agenda for the Hosokawa cabinet 
is political reform, which by all means needs to be completed as 
soon as possible. Considering that there are many within the 
SDPJ who speak strongly against the system of proportional 
representation, the creation of a shift toward political reform 
by appointing Chairman Yamahana and Kanju Sato will make the 
SDPJ follow. This strategy became quite clear. 
  [Reporter C] Many negotiations seem to have taken place 
within the coalition, but in the end, quotas were used, like 
five posts for Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Things haven't 
changed much from the LDP system, where factions took turns. 
There were some efforts to change, like changing the place for 
commemorative picture-taking, but they were minor. 
  [Reporter A] It resembles balancing of power among factions, 
but it had to enlist at least one person from each party because 
it is a coalition government. The rest is balancing within the 
number of seats for the cabinet. The issue is to what extent 
these seven political parties can band together from now on. For 
the time being, they will probably converge into three groups or 
so, such as an in-cabinet unification group and so on. Here, I 
think the issue is how they will be able to cooperate with each 
other at the party-to-party level, or if they will be able to 
unite as a new New Party. 
  [Reporter B] During the LDP's reign, I don't think there was 
a time when all of the heads of the factions became cabinet 
members at the same time. In the case of the current five-party 
group, the head of each party became a cabinet member. 
Therefore, some people say that as all of them are in the 
cabinet, negotiations will go smoothly. In a sense, a cabinet 
meeting is now a conference of the heads of political parties. 
  [Moderator] The SDPJ, which had lost big in the election, 
gained the largest number of posts. The coalition cabinet is 
like being led by the SDPJ, and it doesn't seem right. 
  [Reporter A] In the end, the number speaks itself. Without 
the SDPJ's 70 seats, the non-LDP coalition could not have been 
created. What was said during this process was the possibility 
that Doi would create a pro-Constitution party with 10 or 20 
members. However, she didn't have enough power to take that 
step. If she created a new party, it could have been 
interesting, but it's likely that no one would follow her even 
if she did that. (laughter) However, if 20 of the SDPJ's left 
wing created a pro-Constitution party, saying that they would 
follow their noble cause, the LDP might have gone through 
another breakup, and 20 of its members might have joined the 
party. 
  [Reporter B] There were two votes for "Sadao Yamahana" on 
the 
ballot to appoint a prime minister. Probably Iwatare and Okazaki 
voted for him. There was talk at the beginning that he would get 
a few votes. But, once Doi was taken in, that hope was crashed. 
  [Reporter A] As Doi used to say all sorts of things, if she 
wanted to maintain her lot as a politician, she should have 
created a pro-Constitution party at that time. 
  [Reporter C] As she had vehemently opposed to the idea of 
joining a coalition government, it seems illogical that she 
accepted the post of chairperson of the coalition government. I 
remember Yamahana visited her many times to change her mind, and 
two or three days before then, people from Shinseito and Komeito 
went to see her, believing that she was just putting on a show 
and would accept their offer eventually. So she deserves the 
rumor that she just wanted a post. 
  [Reporter B] Right after the general election, Kazuo Saito, 
an extreme leftist of the SDPJ, tried to have a meeting with Doi 
and other members of the left wing to create a pro-Constitution 
group. But, the only person who came to the meeting was Saito 
himself. (laughter) 
<H5>  How Hosokawa Became Head of the Cabinet </H5>
  [Moderator] Soon after the general election, Hata looked as 
if he were saying, "I'll be in charge." But, all of a sudden, 
Hosokawa came into power. What happened? 
  [Reporter C] There are many theories about the process. From 
the beginning, Hosokawa looked to the possibility of forming a 
coalition. Takemura was somewhat inclined toward the LDP. He had 
close contact with the Mitsuzuka faction, to which he used to 
belong, and was involved in talks to form a coalition with a 
condition that only if Gotoda would become [LDP] president. Of 
course, this kind of information reached the coalition of seven 
parties. Therefore, the coalition side, especially Shinseito, 
pulled Hosokawa in by offering him the position of prime 
minister. 
  [Reporter A] Hosokawa wanted to "take the third road" and 
retain a casting vote. He was quite ambitious from the start. He 
is shrewd, indeed. (laughter) 
  [Reporter C] I think so. He seems to have determined to go 
either way as long as his name was mentioned. He didn't decline 
any offer. 
  [Reporter A] Both the LDP and the non-LDP fought for 
Hosokawa. There was the possibility of a Hosokawa administration 
with the LDP as an ally. Therefore, the LDP changed its party 
resolution willingly to accept the parallel system, I think. 
  [Reporter C] In fact, some within the LDP argued in favor of 
voting for Hosokawa if he became a candidate representing the 
seven parties. That would be a massive coalition, wouldn't it? 
  [Reporter B] After all, Hosokawa is a lord, wanting to be 
always on top of everything by nature. And, although his father 
was a secretary, his grandfather was a prime minister. Reaching 
the father's level first, and then going beyond it--this seems 
to be a man's way of life. (laughter) I get this kind of 
impression. 
  [Reporter C] According to his wife, he used a negative image 
of his grandfather in his mind as a motive for creating the 
Japan New Party--that is, his grandfather became a prime 
minister during the time of radical changes, but he couldn't 
stop the path toward the war. Therefore, he wanted to become a 
prime minister to change the course of Japan's politics, 
steering it toward a positive path. 
  [Reporter A] Speaking of the character of Morihiro Hosokawa 
as a politician, he is a kind of guy who can't be bought. 
(laughter) His statements fluctuate left and right. He projects 
a very modern image. But, speaking from my long career as a 
political reporter in Nagata-cho, I would say that he cannot be 
considered a trustworthy person in the old political world. The 
same can be said about Yohei Kono. Frankly, he is disliked 
within the LDP. Passion and a noble cause exist in the political 
world. When you pursue them straightforwardly, you will gain 
trust. In this sense, they are far from this ideal. 
  [Moderator] Knowing this, did Hata accept this situation? 
  [Reporter A] According to Ozawa's scenario, Hata's turn will 
come much later. If nothing changes, the LDP will win the 
majority in the next general election, assuming that each of the 
non-LDP parties will fight the election battle independently. 
Therefore, to what extent the non-LDP parties can coordinate 
their candidates will be the key. If all goes well, they will be 
able to fight the election battle as a new party. Ozawa 
considers this as the most important contest. Hata's turn will 
come after that. 
  [Moderator] Don't they think, the sooner the better? 
  [Reporter A] Ozawa himself could have become a prime 
minister 
at the time of the birth of the Miyazawa administration. If 
Ozawa had said "yes" then, he could have created the Ozawa 
administration. But, most likely, his administration would have 
gone to pieces. After all, Ozawa has set his eye on such changes 
as restructuring the political world, carrying out political 
reform, and then creating a two-party system in Japan. He is 
right on track for this scenario, although he may go forward and 
backward from time to time. 
  [Reporter B] Ozawa, Yuichi Ichikawa of Komeito and Takashi 
Yonezawa of the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] were not 
included in the current cabinet. This can be explained simply 
because they are all general secretaries, but we must pay close 
attention to the fact that they are not cabinet members. I think 
we can safely say that these three individuals have already 
started the work of coordinating candidates, taking into account 
a new electoral system based on small constituency districts. 
<H3>  The Future of Political Reform--Weaknesses of the Coalition 
Cabinet </H3>
  [Moderator] What do you think about the future of political 
reform? 
  [Reporter C] An extraordinary session of the Diet will be 
convened in early September. What are they going to do during 
the session? Essentially, they will have a debate on a political 
reform bill. The focus, of course, will be on reform of the 
electoral system. Although the governing and opposition parties 
have already agreed on adopting a parallel system, there are 
some specific issues to be dealt with. For example, there is the 
issue of how to allocate seats, including some specific 
problems, such as whether to divide them into 250 and 250, or 
into 300 and 171 as the LDP advocates; and whether to have 
proportional representation nationwide, or by blocks, or by 
prefectures. All this will take time to iron out, I think. 
  [Reporter A] The point is how to come to terms with each 
other in that area. Basically, the non-LDP members agree on the 
allocation into 250 and 250. However, if the number of seats is 
less than 280, they will have to break up the boundaries of 
self-governing municipalities to a considerable degree in order 
to limit the differential of one vote within one to two. In this 
sense, it is significant that Norihiko Narita, former chief of 
the Politics and Parliamentary Affairs Division at the National 
Diet Library, has become Hosokawa's top secretary. Also, from 
the political viewpoint, if the non-LDP side can increase the 
probability of unification, then it will be able to go along 
with a small constituency system. The mood will change so that a 
system tilting toward the small constituency can be accepted. 
  [Reporter C] The LDP may suddenly change its position. They 
changed their party resolution from the simple small 
constituency system to the parallel system after the general 
election. Why did they do that? They didn't change their way of 
thinking, but they made the decision at the eleventh hour, 
thinking that if they supported the parallel system, they might 
be able to form a coalition with the Japan New Party and 
Sakigake [Harbinger Party]. But, in reality, they lost their 
ruling power. Now, some people within the party may begin to 
voice their dissent. In the parallel system, the more seats that 
are in a small constituency district, the better off the LDP 
will be. In the past, the LDP normally had 320 to 330 candidates 
nationwide. Therefore, if the number of seats for the small 
constituency is set at about 300, the LDP will be able to send 
its candidates to all of the electoral districts. If so, it will 
be able to gain approval from its members. If the coalition 
governing parties reach an agreement on 250 and 250, and if the 
LDP doesn't want to yield and insists on 300, it will be 
difficult to reach an agreement. 
  [Moderator] What is the weakest point of the coalition 
government? 
  [Reporter A] On the issue of allocating seats for political 
reform, the coalition will probably not go into infighting that 
is strong enough to break itself up. That's because Yamahana and 
Sato were installed as ministers in charge of this issue so as 
to contain the opposition group within the SDPJ. Also, the 
government will not touch the Constitution lest it should kindle 
the fire. I wonder how it will deal with such issues as 
reduction of income tax, deficit-covering national bonds, and 
consumption tax. The non-LDP side will muddle through somehow 
until the next budget is compiled. 
  [Reporter B] During the general election, the SDPJ, Komeito, 
and the DSP joined forces in advocating income tax reduction. 
But, soon after becoming ministers, Ishida of Komeito and Ouchi 
of DSP began to say something like, it's not necessary to 
implement income tax reduction. Once they assumed responsible 
positions, they changed their tunes. 
  [Reporter C] In favorable terms, this coalition government 
is 
flexible; in unfavorable terms, it is haphazard. For example, 
the SDPJ insisted that the Ozawa problem was a very important 
issue, and said that, unless it was resolved, they would not 
participate in deliberation on budget bills. They stopped the 
budget deliberation, and summoned witnesses. However, once they 
got involved in formation of the coalition government, they said 
that the [Ozawa] issue was trivial. They have no principles; 
they are haphazard. The consumption tax will become a key issue 
when they review the tax system, because the SDPJ is against it. 
Therefore, this issue in fact is worrisome for the cabinet. But, 
as the SDPJ is a very irresponsible party, it may compromise 
readily. If there is kindling, it is a down-to-earth human 
relationship. For example, I think a fire will erupt when the 
conflict between Ozawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura 
comes to the fore. 
  [Moderator] Are they really not able to get along with each 
other? 
  [Reporter C] Takemura hates Ozawa. He is quite distrustful 
of 
Ozawa. On the other hand, Ozawa is going to try to manage the 
cabinet as well as the seven parties of the coalition. 
  [Reporter A] In observing politics, we can't ignore human 
emotions. Underlying the series of big political changes was the 
fight between Ozawa and Kajiyama. Kajiyama wanted to get rid of 
Ozawa even if he had to destroy the LDP. In personnel 
appointments for the current cabinet, the key person is Hiroshi 
Kumagai, minster of international trade and industry. Kajiyama 
is the don of the zoku Diet members of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI]. From now on, with his 
power as MITI minister, Kumagai is going to act as a financial 
pipeline for Kajiyama and make a radical change in relationships 
with industries. This is going to be a bitter war. Hidden behind 
such open and clean issues of political reform and restructuring 
of the political world, machinations in the dark and gloomy side 
will take place further and deeper. 
  [Reporter C] Kumagai is capable of setting up big traps, 
although he has been working behind the scenes all the time. 
  [Moderator] How about Ozawa and Hosokawa? Are they getting 
along? 
  [Reporter A] Frankly, Ozawa doesn't think highly of Hosokawa 
at all. He must be thinking that Hosokawa will dance to his tune 
as long as he is on a pedestal. In Ozawa's grandiose scenario, 
Hosokawa is probably playing only a small part in the first 
stage. 
<H5>  Is Ozawa Hurrying To Create a New New Party? </H5>
  [Moderator] How will the second stage of the Heisei upheaval 
unfold? 
  [Reporter C] I can think of many possible 
developments--within the coalition governing parties, between 
the coalition governing parties and the LDP, and within the LDP. 
Within the coalition governing parties, power struggles will 
develop. By ignoring the request from Shinseito, the Japan New 
Party and Sakigake installed Yukio Hatoyama as a deputy chief 
cabinet secretary. Shinseito wanted to appoint [Yoshihiro] 
Nikai, who is a close associate of Ozawa. This by itself has 
created a foundation for power struggles. 
  Within the LDP, on the other hand, when, for example, a new 
election system becomes effective, a few or dozens of its 
members may decide to leave the party. These people will get 
together to form a group. The speed of politics in Japan is now 
so fast that I don't know what kinds of upheavals will ensue. 
  [Reporter A] After the general election, the number of 
conservatives as a whole, including in Komeito, the DSP, and the 
SDPJ, increased all of a sudden. I'm thinking it would be the 
best if they divide themselves up cleanly into something like 
Republicans and Democrats. Before getting to that point, there 
will be a situation where the non-LDP parties converge into two 
or three groups. If that happens, a few or dozens of LDP members 
may leave the party, I think. 
  Ozawa's scenario seems to be moving along very well, but his 
most critical Achilles' heel is that he joined hands with 
Komeito. Komeito and the Soka Gakkai as a unit are a limited 
organization that will not be able to expand their influence any 
further in Japanese society. By forming an alliance with this 
organization, Ozawa has been able to take control of political 
affairs. The SDPJ is considered as first among the non-LDP 
parties because 70 of its members were elected. However, with 
the combined total of more than 100 Diet members, Shinseito and 
Komeito together are the leading party. This situation has 
served the purpose so far; it has been well orchestrated by 
Ozawa and Ichikawa, the so-called Ichi-Ichi combo. But, Komeito 
should not come forward any further; it should be identified as 
part of a larger organization. Otherwise, there would be no 
future. 
  [Reporter B] Certainly, there seems to exist something like 
Taisaku Ikeda's scenario, in addition to Ozawa's scenario. 
Taisaku Ikeda is chairman of the SGI (Soka Gakkai 
International), and he's been focusing his attention on this 
job. Leaving the affairs of the Soka Gakkai in the hands of 
Chairman Akiya, he's been busying himself with some sort of 
cultural activities. I guess he has visited 60 countries or so. 
And, probably in exchange for the money he brings to these 
countries, he's been collecting all sorts of honorary medals and 
degrees. I think he wants to get a Nobel Peace Prize, 
eventually. For him, therefore, the label of founder of Komeito, 
a political party in Japan, is no longer a blessing. Because of 
this, Ichikawa, general secretary of Komeito, said at last 
year's convention that he was resolved even to remove the 
party's name to accomplish political restructuring. Therefore, 
if Ozawa's strategy brings Komeito to the foreground, it will 
cause some problem for Ikeda. 
  [Reporter A] To avoid that situation, Ozawa will probably 
rush to create a new new party. the Japan New Party and Sakigake 
don't seem to have much future. They had their boom during the 
last election. Although they played a very important role in 
taking a step toward restructuring of the political world, they 
only have a bunch of amateurs. The idea of their running the 
government gives me goose bumps. 
  [Reporter C] Hosokawa also said honestly that his party 
didn't have people who could be instrumental in policymaking and 
that, because of this, he had to cooperate with Sakigake. And, 
since the day after the general election, Shinseito has been 
trying to recruit some defeated candidates from the LDP. In this 
respect, I think the momentum for creation of a new party or for 
restructuring will accelerate further. 
  [Moderator] Does Ozawa not want to come to the forefront--to 
take political power--till the end? 
  [Reporter A] He's only 51; he still has 10 years or so to 
go. 
He's probably thinking that he will take power during a 
relatively stable period after the two-party system is firmly 
installed. He also knows that he is disliked. 
  [Moderator] Is he disliked? 
  [Reporter C] Yes, he is, and he's acutely aware of it. In 
maneuvering to create a coalition, he told Hosokawa that he 
wouldn't mind leaving his party. I don't know whether he really 
meant it. But if he came to the forefront, he might run into 
trouble; if he stayed in the background, he might be called a 
behind-the-scenes strongman. So, he probably thought that it 
would be best to bring Hosokawa to the cabinet. 
  [Reporter A] A dual structure of power, isn't it? If it 
involves Taisaku Ikeda, that's not good. But, if it is a dual 
structure with Ozawa in the background, I can live with it. It 
provides us a sense of security in the administration. But, if 
Hosokawa alone runs the administration, I will be worried. 
  [Moderator] As I listened to what you said, I've come to 
wonder if Ozawa is the only person who thinks seriously about 
Japan and the world. 
  [Reporter A] When the factional politics of the LDP--the era 
of Miki, Tanaka, Ohira, Fukuda, and Nakasone--was at its best, 
each faction head spoke on world affairs and ran the 
administration according to his particular style. For example, 
Ohira propounded a nation of culture and Zenko Suzuki left his 
legacy of harmonious politics, although he was called 
feebleminded. Nakasone dealt with postwar politics, and 
Takeshita introduced consumption tax. Then, Abe, Takeshita, and 
Miyazawa were called neo-new leaders following Miki, Tanaka, 
Ohira, and Fukuda, but when they were about to get organized, 
they plunged into the era of political restructuring. 
  Yoshio Mori is a kind of politician of whom much was 
expected 
for his future and should have been nurtured to grow. The same 
is true of Koichi Kato. Although we want former neo-new leaders 
and neo-neo-new leaders to flex their muscles, they look forlorn 
these days. 
  [Reporter C] Yes, indeed. 
<H5>  Will the LDP Be Able To Regain Power? </H5>
  [Moderator] What do you think about the possibility of the 
LDP, the opposition party, regaining power? 
  [Reporter A] The LDP has clearly realized since it yielded 
power that it is a fragile, weak, and uncoordinated 
organization. It stayed in power for 38 years, and the secret 
was that the LDP was very good at election campaign--each member 
had his own solid supporters association. Faced with the biggest 
crisis, they are now trying to reenforce these old-style 
supporters associations. 
  The LDP sees the small constituency system in a way that is 
quite different from that in England. As each electoral district 
will shrink from a medium to a small constituency district, they 
will have to strengthen their local-oriented services. Reduction 
of seats from four to one means that the size of one's electoral 
district becomes a half or a third, counting the effect of the 
parallel system. Now, there are some people who talk seriously 
about introducing a computer system, in which they enter the 
names of households and family members in a computer and mail 
birthday cards to them. (laughter) Using such a system, they are 
hoping to win under the small constituency system. 
  Ideally, we'd like to see establishment of new parties, 
representing the LDP versus the non-LDP, each having its own 
policy and ideology, and carrying out election campaigns pitting 
party against party. But this won't happen in the Japanese-style 
small constituency system. 
  [Moderator] As soon as it became an opposition party, the 
LDP 
lost its centripetal force. Who is running the LDP now? 
  [Reporter C] It's surely not Yohei Kono. (laughter) Opinions 
abound. For example, some say that the LDP will not exist in a 
year's time. But, even though it split during the last election, 
it secured 223 seats. And, people said that some of its members 
would leave the party during the nomination of the party 
president, but even the Kato group lost only some of its 
members. The LDP barely retained its members. To be sure, it has 
lost its centripetal force. Factional control is quite different 
from that in the old days. But, I think there are many members 
who are staying with the LDP because they can't find any other 
place to go--if they leave the party and join Shinseito, it's 
like a repeat of the same old thing; and if they create a new 
party, it also seems like repeating the same old line. 
Therefore, Kono's role is to prevent these people from leaving 
the party, and to prepare the party for victory in the next 
election, I think. 
  On the other hand, what they can do as a political party is 
to change its system so that they will be able to cope in the 
new era. They've been studying various means, such as changing 
the administrative procedures completely or running the 
Executive Council differently. But, in order to gain recognition 
from the public, they must do something bold, like eliminate 
party resolutions on each individual policy. Unless they do 
that, it would be difficult for them to regain power and create 
an LDP empire like in the old days. 
  [Reporter A] When there was a division between conservatives 
and reformists under the backdrop of the cold war, the reformist 
side, being led by the SDPJ, wasn't a group that aspired to 
create a reformist administration. Instead, it was simply a 
receptacle of complaints and dissatisfaction against the 
conservative administration. This time, the conservative group 
as a whole became large. It doesn't matter whether you vote for 
the LDP or for the non-LDP. Then, how are they going to compete 
for voter support? I think the focus of competition is how well 
they can address the needs of the time and appeal to public 
sentiment. Of course, there are many factors, such as policy, 
ideology, and party image. But, since it's no longer a matter of 
ideology, it will be a competition based on each other's image, 
to which one the public will decide to entrust Japan's future. 
The LDP hasn't understood this point yet; it is way behind. 
  [Moderator] Has the new coalition government truly overcome 
such ideologically divisive issues as the Constitution and the 
Self-Defense Forces [SDF]? 
  [Reporter B] During the press conference for inauguration of 
ministers, a reporter from ASAHI asked pointed questions, 
focusing on issues relating to the Japanese flag and the SDF. In 
general, ministers from the SDPJ responded with flexible 
statements. But I don't know what their actual thoughts are. 
They need to convene a party assembly and straighten their basic 
policy stance on various issues, including the Japanese flag and 
the SDF. 
  [Reporter A] I wonder how vigorous the SDPJ will be when 
that 
time comes. (laughter) 
  [Reporter B] If they don't do that, it doesn't make sense. 
Having different basic policies, the SDPJ should stay outside 
the cabinet. 
  [Moderator] After all, the LDP and the non-LDP have 
differences that center on the Constitution. When they try to 
iron out these differences, will there be some kind of force for 
restructuring again? 
  [Reporter A] At the time of the merger of conservatives, the 
need to establish our own Constitution acted as a driving force 
for the merger. When the current restructuring of the political 
world gained momentum last year, people thought that the issue 
of our Constitution would become a driving force, and everyone, 
including the United Social Democratic Party, Komeito, and the 
DSP, began reviewing the issue for a while. After all, that was 
a signal to the Ozawa group. Ozawa himself, however, is playing 
both ends, even on the issue of Article 9, saying that even 
without a revision, we can carry out armed operations under the 
supervision of the United Nations. He's not gung ho about 
revising the Constitution. Therefore, although I feel that the 
Constitution will certainly become a driving force, I can't 
predict how it will set the stage for restructuring. 
  [Reporter C] The reason the recent election turned out as it 
did is that voters wanted to let their wishes be known that when 
a two-party system becomes effective, they want the LDP to be 
one of the two parties. Even though they didn't want the LDP to 
assume power this time, they hoped that the party would play an 
important role in the future two-party system. On the other 
hand, I think they also showed that they didn't want the SDPJ to 
assume an important role. The LDP should recognize this point 
clearly. They have to improve the nature of their party so as to 
cope in the new era as a political party capable of governing. 
After the election, the office of Mitsuzuka, chairman of the 
Policy Affairs Research Council, was investigated for violation 
of election law. Some employees of Tohoku Kashima who had been 
assigned to the office were arrested. What's amazing is that 
they were still following the old campaign practices. Such 
practices are not fit for the next election. 
  [Reporter A] Mitsuzuka worked hard during the process of 
installing Kono as the new party president, but behind this were 
scandals--the Ibaragi scandal for Kajiyama, the violation of 
election law for Mitsuzuka, and the scandal involving the mayor 
of Sendai before them. Because of all this, these people were 
all tied up, and therefore Kono became the new party president. 
We can't ignore this fact. The LDP is not facing the fundamental 
question of why it lost the majority. 
  [Moderator] What was Gotoda's role in the recent upheaval? 
  [Reporter C] Public prosecutors have very strong political 
clout right now. They act politically. What they are trying to 
do is cut the foundation of the old-style political practice 
that depends on construction companies. The reason Gotoda 
promoted Kono rather than Mitsuzuka during the election for 
party president is that, as justice minister, he was aware of 
various facts. In other words, he warned indirectly that the 
public prosecutors would mobilize their resources if political 
reform were not taken up seriously. 
  [Reporter A] The Miyazawa administration was created by the 
Takeshita faction and the Kanemaru-Ozawa line. But it faltered 
due to the arrest of Kanemaru and the breakup of the Takeshita 
faction. I think Miyazawa mistook the situation. Seeing the 
breakup of the Takeshita faction and the collapse of its 
political structure, he tried hard at one point to restructure 
his power base with the help of bureaucratic control as in the 
old Ministry of Home Affairs, by trying to ally himself with 
Gotoda. But, it didn't last long. I think Gotoda was keenly 
aware of this situation, too. 
<H5>  What Did the SDPJ Mean? </H5>
  [Moderator] In this age, when everyone seems to have become 
a 
conservative, what is the raison d'etre for the SDPJ and the DSP? 
  [Reporter B] There are no more distinctions as to ideology 
or 
between conservatives and reformists. In this sense, a 
middle-of-the-road may no longer exist. Coalition of the SDPJ 
and the DSP is an old story. Politics has advanced further than 
that, and now it is a coalition of non-LDP parties. The DSP has 
already become a full conservative party. But, in the case of 
the SDPJ, its organization, especially in local areas, is 
problematic -- ultraleftists called the Tokenkyo till control at 
the local Dietmen's level. There is a possibility that the 
SDPJ's ultraleftists and the Japanese Communist Party [JCP] 
persist as the third axis. 
  [Reporter A] If the people who have been advocating Marxism 
want to pursue their noble cause, they should form their own 
group. When you visited a town assembly in some local area, 
didn't you run into only one member from the JCP? If they occupy 
few seats in the Diet like that, they will cause no trouble. 
  [Moderator] What was the role of Yamagishi of Rengo? Some 
say that he is one of leading players in restructuring the 
political world. 
  [Reporter B] In the recent election, Rengo made clear to the 
SDPJ whom it would support as candidates. It also supported 51 
candidates from the three new parties--Shinseito, the Japan New 
Party, and Sakigake. Reportedly, Yamagishi made the strategic 
decision, but actual maneuvers were made by industry-based 
unions that comprise Rengo. Frankly, the method used by 
Yamagishi, who tends to speak as he pleases, seems outmoded. 
People like Teruhito Emoto of the Federation of Japan Automobile 
Workers Unions and Etsuya Washio of the Japanese Federation of 
Iron and Steel Workers Unions have already had the idea of 
introducing the small constituency system for some years. 
Yamagishi might have been the one who wrote the scenario of 
restructuring the political world, but the actual movers were 
those who will assume leadership roles in Rengo in the future. 
Yamagishi used to push vehemently for a coalition of the SDPJ 
and the DSP. This idea was completely crashed due to the results 
of the upper house elections. Still, that man is like a 
loudspeaker. (laughter) Such being the case, there are strong 
criticisms against Yamagishi within Rengo. 
  [Reporter A] That will become an issue during their 
convention in October, which may well be a turning point for 
Rengo. I think it will be better if he [Yamahana] is replaced by 
a new leader--someone in the level of Emoto or Washio. 
  [Reporter C] I don't mind that the head of the SDPJ comes 
in, 
but Yamahana should resign. If a new party leader was chosen and 
became a cabinet member, it could have been understandable. They 
don't seem to understand when to stop and when to start. 
  [Reporter B] Speaking of logic, I really don't understand 
the 
SDPJ. For example, it's so strange that a minister appointed 
from the SDPJ is chairman of the national security. 
  [Reporter A] They fought in the Narita struggle to such an 
extreme extent, and some people died. Now, there aren't any SDPJ 
Dietmen who don't use the Narita Airport when they go abroad. 
(laughter) Though, I heard that there had been one such person 
until recently. 
  [Moderator] The Chiba section of a newspaper had a list of 
landlords who own one tsubo [3.954 square yards] each. Most of 
them are SDPJ Diet members. 
  [Reporter B] Shigeru Ito was also involved in the Narita 
struggle. But, now, he is transport minister. (laughter) 
  [Reporter A] But the same kind of things can be said for the 
LDP. When they changed their party resolution from the simple 
small constituency to the parallel system, Takayuki Sato made a 
memorable remark: "Time changes." 
  [Reporter C] Yes, he said, "Time will change." That was 
funny.

<F P=106> [Article by Hideo Otake, professor of Kyoto University] </F>
  [Text] Two tendencies among the new conservatives have 
united to give birth to the Hosokawa administration. They are 
the tendency toward "small government" and the tendency toward a 
"cultural age." However, neither has a strong political support 
base. What is called for is political participation by the 
citizens and residents. 
<H3>  Ad Hoc Council on Administrative Reform and the "Cultural 
Age" </H3>
  Within the coalition administration, the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] is divided by internal confrontation and 
on the brink of oblivion. Komeito is also headed toward merging 
with the conservative new parties. Japan's political party 
structure already appears to be shifting toward a conservative 
two-party or three-party system. 
  The outlook is the result of the advent of two new 
conservative forces--Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the 
Japan New Party/Sakigake [Harbinger] Party--in addition to the 
LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] which is the old conservative 
force. Forming the backdrop are the two political tendencies 
since the late 1970's. One is the trend that progressed from 
administrative reform to political reform. The other is what may 
be called the tendency toward a "cultural age." In this article, 
we intend to examine the two eral tendencies that gave rise to 
the Hosokawa administration, and to use our findings as material 
to consider the future outlook. 
  First, let us look at the transition from administrative 
reform to political reform. The administrative reform based on 
the Second Ad Hoc Council on Administrative Reform [hereafter 
referred to as the "Ad Hoc Council"] has various aspects, and 
the most characteristic is the fact that it was a challenge 
against the money politics of the LDP (more than it was an 
attack against leftwing forces). In other words, it was an 
attempt to dismantle the "iron triangle" which is formed by the 
government agencies, the industrial sector, and the "zoku" 
[special interest group] Diet members. The Kankoro [National 
Council of Government and Public Workers' Unions], including the 
Kokuro [National Railway Workers' Union], which is seen as 
having united with these forces to protect its own vested 
interests, was also a target of attack. 
  Viewed from this aspect, administrative reform was actually 
also an attempt toward restoration of power by the bureaucrats. 
The reason is that the "iron triangle" found itself in a 
situation where the government organization was eroded by the 
"zoku" Dietmen and the administrative rationality of the 
bureaucrats was distorted. For the individual bureaucrat, due to 
such inducements as ensuring one's employment after government 
retirement, the benefits brought by the "iron triangle" were a 
matter of major concern. On the other hand, the loss of 
independence was the price paid by the government organization. 
  At this point, regulation by the state, for example, was 
more 
a means to protect the vested interests of the industrial 
circles than an expression of the maintenance and expansion of 
authority by the government agencies. The realization of 
administrative reform through the initiatives of the elite 
bureaucrats cannot be understood without such a backdrop. The 
fact that pension reform and health insurance reform were 
realized through the initiatives of the top elite of the Welfare 
Ministry is well known. However, it was also a process in which 
the Welfare Ministry escaped from the influence of the Kankoro 
which tried to protect its vested interests, and from the 
control of such industry organizations as the Japan Medical 
Association. Also, the privatization of the Japan National 
Railways and the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public 
Corporation [NTT] was realized because the elite bureaucrats of 
the Transportation Ministry and the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications who had resisted at the outset changed their 
direction. It was because the bureaucrats of the two ministries 
became aware of the administrative rationality of their 
respective ministries. 
  In addition, the "zoku" Diet members, who acquired 
administrative rationality through the experience of rule under 
long-term administrations, suppressed the demands for protection 
of vested interests by the rank-and-file "zoku" members and 
marched toward reform, thus enabling a series of administrative 
reforms. Also, the Finance Ministry bureaucrats, who stand at 
the top of the government pyramid, became the major promoters of 
administrative reform on the government's side. Moreover, it is 
equally significant that the major force for administrative 
reform consisted of the top elite of the financial circles, and 
that they displayed great power in throttling the demands of the 
industrial circles under their jurisdiction. 
<H5>  Political Reform Was Necessary </H5>
  Various factors nudged Japan's elite toward reform. The 
introduction of software and the internationalization of the 
Japanese economy provided the backdrop, the maturation of 
Japanese society was a factor for pension reform and health and 
insurance reform (including aging), and the internationalization 
of Japan's politics was a factor for the debate on international 
contribution in the era of administrative reform. 
  However, particularly significant were the demands that 
resulted from Japan's internationalization. Concretely, it was 
the pressures brought to bear by the United States, demanding 
market opening and contributions by Japan. Faced with these 
pressures, Japan's elite arrived at the judgment that they must 
comply with international demands even at the sacrifice of 
domestic demands. It was in this context that, with the progress 
of administrative reform, they deepened their awareness that 
political reform was indispensable for administrative reform. 
  Numerous problems remain which could not be solved by the 
administrative reforms in the first half of the 1980's. The 
agricultural problems centering on rice are typical. Other 
reforms are the easing of regulations and the reform of special 
corporations. Consequently, the United States has made severe 
demands against Japan in the forum of the Japan-U.S. Structural 
Impediments Initiative [SII] talks. In order to meet these 
tasks, reform of the ruling and opposition parties that have 
been resisting--i.e. "political reform"--became necessary. 
  However, the "political reform" was, more than 
administrative 
reform, a challenge against the power base of the elite in the 
form of stablized control by the conservative party. The greater 
the progress toward political reform, the greater was the 
resulting destruction of their own power base. However, an 
awareness arose among the elite that they could not commit 
themselves to the nation's tasks without restructuring their 
power base itself. The election system reform proposed several 
years ago was a means to meet the tasks by restructuring the 
power base of the political parties. 
  In the first place, administrative reform was pushed through 
with powerful support by public opinion mobilized by the mass 
media. Its substantial support layer was the urban 
salaried-worker class that was unrelated to the vested interests 
called the "iron triangle." From the standpoint of the LDP's 
support base, it means a shift from the farm regions to the 
cities, and from the old middle class to the new middle class. 
However, it is extremely difficult to make the new support layer 
a stable political base with the current election system as the 
premise. The glorious advent and disappointing exit of the 
Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club was the outcome of such a risk. 
  In order to overcome this instability, the reform of the 
election system is a most effective means. The proposed 
small-constituency system and the proportional-representation 
system are both expected to provide stable support bases for the 
new conservative parties by centering elections on the political 
parties. Moreover, the systems will strengthen central party 
authority within the political parties. The plan avoids the fate 
of the Shinjiyu Club, and is simultaneously a double-edged 
strategy for the elite to cut off pressure from the industrial 
circles and the (rank-and-file) "zoku" Dietmen who received 
support from those circles. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, who was the core promoter of election system 
reform and the most enthusiastic supporter of PKO [UN 
peacekeeping operations], epitomizes the above-mentioned 
tendency for a shift from the direction of the Ad Hoc Council to 
political reform. 
<H5>  Tendency of a "Sense of Play" </H5>
  However, there is a second tendency among the new 
conservatives which has a number of traits in common with the 
above-mentioned tendency, but at the same time it is 
intrinsically different. It is personified by Prime Minister 
Hosokawa. Its traits are typified, above all else, by his 
political style. A sense of play, leeway, an "age of 
sensibility" and the natural man--expressions used by the prime 
minister himself--describe the tendency. Hosokawa's criticism of 
"efficiency for efficiency's sake" and his expression of "a 
sense of play" translate into a policy of "not scrimping on 
design fees" for public construction, for example, in actual 
policies. However, such a posture is clearly foreign to the 
direction of the Ad Hoc Council. 
  The Ad Hoc Council may be said to have concretely 
represented 
the interests of the "consumers/taxpayers" with the urban 
salaried worker in mind. However, the "consumers" represented by 
Hosokawa are a class that seeks quality goods that satisfy good 
taste despite somewhat higher costs, and not goods that are 
"cheap but shoddy." They are people who, despite their awareness 
of cost, seek services commensurate with the prices paid. 
Regarding easing of regulations also, rather than chiefly 
blaming regulations for economic inefficiency, their criticism 
is directed mainly toward the bureaucracy for its adherence to 
efficiency and its "inelegant" uniformism that strives to 
maintain minimum standards nationwide. 
  Also, Hosokawa's sense of play which contrasts with the late 
Toshio Doko's stoic lifestyle and Ozawa's straightforwardness, 
is a contrast between the latter's sense of crisis and sense of 
mission as the policymaking elite, and the awareness of an 
amateur politician who considers politics as one among a number 
of pursuits. It is the difference of the political and economic 
elite and the upper class (or the cultural elite). 
  In a word, Hosokawa may be said to express the political 
sense of the mainstay upper-class salaried workers of the cities 
who do not feel any particularly serious and urgent mission in 
politics. The statement by Hosokawa while he was governor that 
"the only legacy that can be left by administration is culture" 
directly expresses his philosophy. 
  For the supporters of the Japan New Party and the new 
Sakigake, and for the relatively affluent middle class of the 
cities, politics is truly one of a number of activity domains. 
It is a domain from which "withdrawal" is possible at any time. 
The "fickleness" of this class as voting constituents reflects 
it. It is the opposite of (a part of) the farmers and smaller 
enterprises that are obliged to depend on politics within 
economic activity and who regard political support as 
indispensable. 
  It is natural that this class welcomes with a sense of 
affinity the Hosokawa style of being able and ready to quit at 
any time. Politics must be, above all else, an interesting drama 
for them. The drama of a "change in government" was climactic. 
  Hosokawa's record as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture was 
characterized by the construction of buildings and the 
sponsorship of events as cultural legacies, and by his appeal 
for a "distinctive prefecture." The quickest way to accomplish 
this was to invite national-level designers and cultural 
personalities to work in Kumamoto. It could be described as 
bringing an urban and Tokyo-type sensibility (or, further, a 
West European culture) directly into the farming and "local 
areas." Typical construction included the ultramodern police 
stations, prefecural housing complexes, bridges and toilets. A 
cultural orientation quite different from the 
development-oriented past is clearly seen here. 
<H5>  Ohira-Sonoda Urban Concept </H5>
  To reflect on the past, the emphasis on "culture" in 
administration goes back to the Sonoda urban concept of the 
Ohira cabinet (incidentally, the Japan New Party also advocates 
the Sonoda cultural sphere concept). The nine "policy study 
groups" organized by Ohira called for the realization of "more 
lofty aspirations" or "spiritual and cultural affluence" as 
Japan's task in the 21st century. The central slogan was "a 
cultural age" as a substitute for the economic age. It also 
sought an expanded cultural budget and fiscal spending to build 
a transportation/information network (for the formation of a 
pastoral city state). 
  It was premised on pride that Japan had caught up with and 
passed Europe and the United States, and optimism concerning the 
future. The assumption was that leisure time will increase in 
the future, and cultural activity with the elements of "leisure" 
and "play" will rise as consumer activity. Of course, forming 
the backdrop is self-confidence that Japan has overcome a double 
oil-shock to achieve a favorable economic performance surpassing 
the other advanced nations. It is a policy direction that is 
clearly based on a different awareness from the direction of 
administrative reform that appeared immediately later. 
  Because the continuity between the scholars who participated 
in the Ad Hoc Council and the brains of the Ohira cabinet is 
often debated, the difference between the two tendencies is apt 
to be overlooked. However, the difference between the two groups 
is decisive. In administrative reform, aside from the 
formulation of the ideological portion, it was the economists 
and financiers like Hiroshi Kato and Yoichi Sando who displayed 
their power through concrete policy designs, resulting in the 
ideology of economic liberalism. However, Ohira's brain trust, 
centering on such cultural stalwarts as Masakazu Yamazaki, were 
a group with a different and unique principle from the principle 
of competition. Those overlapping with them were only a handful 
of scholars concerned with international politics (if Kenichi 
Koyama, who was later active in the National Council on 
Educational Reform, is excluded). 
  The intellectuals advocating a "cultural age," who formed 
the 
core of the Ohira group, contended that the principle of 
competition on the cultural dimension contained an inherent 
tendency for bad money to chase out good money as seen in the 
television culture described as "turning 100 million people into 
idiots," and that it was impossible to fully agree with the 
logic of free competition "to create high-level concepts." Based 
on this, they contended that "some sort of public environment 
and means are necessary" for "basic academic research and the 
creation of a new cultural tradition." 
  Ohira himself had sought aggressive activity by the state 
worthy of an "age of culture," and had intended to solve the 
fiscal deficit, not by conversion to a small state, but by 
increasing taxes. From this standpoint, the transition from 
Ohira to Suzuki and Nakasone was an important turning point in 
policy. 
  Furthermaore, the pastoral city state concept was clearly an 
urban planning and national planning concept, and was different 
from the direction of the ad hoc commission whose staple was the 
principle of free competition. This is most clearly evident in 
the difference between the commission mainstream, which stressed 
deregulation of land use, and the pastoral city state concept, 
which proposed aggressive land expropriation from the standpoint 
of public ownership of land. 
<H5>  Burden of "Culture" Assumed by Local Regions </H5>
  Faced by a budget deficit, Japan at the time may be said to 
have had two options. And, faced with these options, there was a 
difference in judgment as to how to inherently view the budget 
deficit. Beginning with Michio Watanabe who assumed the post of 
finance minister in the Suzuki cabinet, the rhetoric of those 
who stressed a budget crisis explained the budget crisie in the 
same light as the household budget. It is easy for any budget 
specialist to understand that such a naive metaphor is a fallacy. 
  A budget deficit is essentially different from an 
individual's loan. The argument can be made that it is not a 
problem which requires an immediate solution because there is no 
loan from a foreign country involved, and there was actually 
such an argument. In Ohira's case, it was necessary to 
implicitly recognize the validity of such a rebuttal and, on 
that basis, the budget "crisis" had to be solved in order to 
invoke future budgetary power. Rather, it was considered to be 
necessary as preparation for the display of state power. (As far 
as this writer knows, he never stated that a budget deficit in 
itself creates a situation of crisis.) 
  In any case, Ohira's theory implied an awareness that Japan 
had become an affluent nation (after overcoming the two oil 
shocks), and it is seen as totally different from the awareness 
of the Ad Hoc Council which stressed the imminent budget crisis 
and the future arrival of the "advanced nation's disease." It 
also judged that the urban salaried workers could afford to 
accept a certain degree of increased burden. 
  Generally speaking, the argument for "small government" as a 
backlash against the Keynesian welfare state is said to have 
appeared with the post-oil-shock economic crisis in the advanced 
nations as the backdrop, and the radical reforms by the Thatcher 
and Reagan administrations are considered to be typical. 
However, Japan's economy had already completely overcome the 
economic crisis resulting from the oil shocks when the Ohira 
cabinet made its advent. 
  In Japan, after overcoming the economic crisis and due to 
its 
impetus, such liberal reforms as the reexamination of welfare 
based on the "small government" theory and privatization 
appeared on the scene. In that sense, it must be said that the 
necessity for reform was lower than in Europe and the United 
States. In other words, it may be said that in the early 1980's 
there was another option besides administrative reform (this 
point is essentially different from the Mitterrand 
administration of France which introduced social democratic 
policies and was simultaneously brought down). 
  However, historical reality shows that the Ohira direction 
was rejected with a tax increase as the reason, and the 
direction of using the affluence achieved by Japan for spiritual 
and cultural policies (or more generally, the buildup of social 
capital) was denied, resulting in the pursuit of further 
efficiency and economic growth. In other words, a policy of 
accumulating further wealth to prevent future crises was 
adopted. It will probably be criticized as an excessive 
preventive step. The bubble economy may be said to be the 
consequence (from this standpoint, it is probably ironic that 
the Hosokawa administration faces a major task of overcoming a 
long-term recession, and is demanded to overcome it through 
budgetary mobility). 
  However, it is also important from the standpoint of later 
evolvement that the "age of culture" concept of the Ohira era 
had formed a twin pillar with the "age of the local regions" in 
support of the pastoral city state. 
  In the first place, there is very little work concerning 
policy by local governments that requires urgent solutions (like 
the central government), except routinely processed 
administration. Moreover, once a headman is elected, he may 
exercise the prerogative of his incumbency to secure his 
position for eight to 12 years, or even beyond 20 years. Each 
headman has a political base which plays a central role in 
"cultural" policy according to his own preference. 
  That is why the local governments have taken on the 
challenge 
of an age of culture. And that is exactly what Hosokawa had done 
as governor of Kumamoto Prefecture. In the last half of the 
1980's when budget reform made reasonable progress, and 
particularly about the time the Takeshita regime came into 
being, the regional age (of culture) expanded nationally. The 
"creation of the homeland," which was the centerpiece of the 
Takeshita cabinet, is a concrete example. Governor Hosokawa was 
one of its pioneers. 
<H5>  Toward Political Participation by the Citizens </H5>
  The birth of the Hosokawa administration signifies the 
convergence of the aforementioned two new conservative 
tendencies. Despite their differences, there was no lack of 
opportunities for convergence by the two tendencies 
(transcending a simple and impulsive union). The primary factor 
was the denial of the LDP's money politics. It was a union 
between a denial by the elite based on the practical necessity 
for criticism of the status quo-minded policymaking system, and 
the perceptional rejection among the urban mainstay and 
upper-layer salaried workers on the level of its image as a 
"dirty" system. 
  Easing regulations is at once a strategy for "restructuring 
Japan" among the elite and a policy to promote the interests of 
the consumers, as we have pointed out. The deregulating policy 
agreed upon by the two new conservative forces and proposed as a 
policy program may be interpreted as a merger between criticism 
from the top and criticism from the bottom against the "iron 
triangle." Furthermore, the tendency of an "age of culture" has 
provided an opportunity to join also to the SDPJ which has had a 
support base in a portion of the urban salaried-worker class. 
Its participation in the ruling coalition can be understood in 
terms of such a backdrop. 
  Nonetheless, there continues to be a lack of a strong 
political support base in the two new conservative trends. For 
example, the easing of controls that began during the Carter era 
in the United States was prompted by a rise of the consumer 
movement. Reagan's advocation of "small government" also 
originated from a movement called the taxpayers' revolt. In 
contrast, neither movement exists in Japan. 
  The direction of the Ad Hoc Council in easing regulations 
and 
advocating "small government" was merely evoked and mobilized by 
"pubiic opinion" with support by the mass media as the backdrop. 
Consequently, after the initial stage of reform, an ironic 
phenomenon arose in the form of the Japan-U.S. SII talks in that 
the United States spoke for the interests of the consumers in 
Japan. 
  Meanwhile, in the tendency toward an "age of culture" also, 
elitism takes the lead. It can also be seen in the criticism of 
Governor Hosokawa's track record. It is said that, by inviting 
designers and cultural personalities from Tokyo and introducing 
top-level cultural assets to Kumamoto, he has perhaps merely 
strengthened his yearning for Tokyo's culture. It is described 
as "providing a dream." The harder a local headman pursues 
top-level culture, the more difficult it is for it to take root, 
and the limitation of cultural elitism becomes exposed. The 
participation of the general citizenry becomes unavoidably 
difficult. 
  It is true that, as governor, Hosokawa energized the will 
for 
participation by local government employees. He introduced the 
method of participation used by employees of Japan's companies 
(through QC [quality control] circles, for example) to the local 
bodies--i.e. the same method used by (the then) Chairman Hisashi 
Shindo of the Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Public Corp. It 
served to energize the local bodies, but it is highly 
questionable whether it promoted participation at the citizens' 
level. The situation is pretty much the same in the cities, 
towns, and villages throughout Japan that have been urged toward 
city-building and town-building. 
  It is clear from the foregoing discussion that the two new 
conservative forces have failed to create a culture that 
promotes active public participation such as participation in 
Japan's politics. Therein remains a potential which is yet to be 
cultivated in Japan's politics. Amid the internal contest among 
the coalition forces, including the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan, the political party that arouses the will for 
participation and succeeds in organizing it will be able to 
survive. And that party will definitely become the matrix of 
true political reform.
